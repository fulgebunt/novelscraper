    "Chapter 1": "Chapter 1: SwindlerTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Swindler! Great swindler!\"An enraged roar can be heard and the sound of footsteps on a bluestone pavement by someone escaping could be heard.Zhang Xuan stretches out his both hands helpless, \"I am not a swindler, I am a teacher of the academy... I only want to make you my student! Besides that, do you have to add a 'great' while saying that I am a swindler? You make it sound as though I am some unpardonable criminal...\"After he finishes his muttering, he recalls the words of the director, \"This is the 17th one already! If I still fail to find a student today, I would have to pack up and leave tomorrow!\"Zhang Xuan isn't a person from this world, but an ordinary librarian of a high school. He only remembers the blazing flames and then... There is no more then. When he woke up, he was already in this world.This world is just like the ones depicted in novels, the path of martial arts is respected and the strong reigns!Initially, he thought that after traversing, he would become a useless talent and end up rejected by his fiancee. Afterward, he would strike back, slapping them in their face, and his life would proceed smoothly from then on... Looks like he had overthought it. After arriving here, he realized that he isn't a student but a... teacher!The most pathetic teacher in the entire academy!The lectures of other people are always overflowing with people that many people who find themselves without seats. On the other hand, there isn't a single person in his class. It was difficult for him to rope in a few students but they ended up labeling him as a 'swindler' and escaped!As for the reason, ignoring the fact that the fellow whose body got took over by him was the weakest teacher in the entire campus and his inability to pick out talents, the crux of it all is that... he even misguided a student, causing his cultivation to go berserk!This was just like having a dead patient under your record! His reputation went down and he was despised by everyone else. Even the new students chose to stay away from him, afraid that they would end up in the same situation if they were to fall into his clutches.A bad track record and his lack of students caused him to be ranked as the first from the bottom in the entire academy for the Teacher Qualification Examination last year. He even got the first and only zero marks in the entire history of the academy.Depressed, he used alcohol to drown his sorrows. In the end, just as he wished, he died, providing an opportunity for Zhang Xuan to leap over.At the start of a new term, the academy issued an ultimatum to him. If he were to be unable to recruit a single student to his lessons by this year, his qualifications as a teacher would be revoked!Today, there were already 17 new students who passed by his classroom. In the end, the moment they heard his name, every one of them ran away, as though a young lady meeting a strange uncle, running as far as their feet could take them.\"Looks like I have to look for a way to coax one of them!\"As he is still thinking about how he should rope someone in, he sees the head of a girl with a dazed expression at the entrance.\"May I ask if this is the classroom of Teacher Lu Xun?\"She has a cute and elegant appearance, not to mention her sweet voice.Teacher Lu Xun is the academy's star teacher. His lessons are always packed and innumerable people chose to come to the academy due to his fame.\"I will take her!\" Seeing someone walking into his trap, Zhang Xuan's eyes light up.Recalling all kinds of methods to act cool from his previous life, he sits quietly on his chair and poses like an enlightened expert, \"You want to become his student?\"The young girl nods her head furiously as admiration appears in her pitch-black pupils, \"I have heard that Teacher Lu Xun is the most incredible teacher in Hongtian Academy. All of the students he taught are extraordinary and joining his class is an honor in itself!\"\"Rumors may not reflect the truth. Teachers are just like shoes, what is important is whether it fits or not! No matter how well he lectures, if the theories are not suited to the skills you are practicing, not only will you find it hard to advance, your strength might even regress! Even if a teacher isn't well-known, if his theories harmonize with yours, you can still improve swiftly and your cultivation will rise exponentially!\"\"Is that so... I have also heard my elder brother saying such words before!\" The young girl ponders for a moment, uncertainty appearing in her beautiful eyes. \"However, I don't know what kind of lessons would suit me!\"Seeing that she is on the hook, Zhang Xuan's eyes light up. He hesitates for a moment as great sages like Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels flashes through one after another in his mind. He feigns a look of difficulty and says, \"Our meeting could be considered as destiny as well. How about this, I am also a teacher of this academy. I will help you take a look at your bones, talents and personality and recommend a suitable teacher for you!\"\"Then I will trouble you, mister!\" She didn't expect that a teacher she met so casually would be so accommodating. The girl immediately nods her excitedly.\"Display your cultivation first!\"Zhang Xuan's eyes are half-open, putting on a look as though this doesn't bother him in any way.\"Yes!\"Huuuuuuuuuuu!In a short moment, the entire room whistles from the shockwave of her punch. Wave after wave of spiritual energy swims around the body of the girl. For her spiritual energy to gather instead of dispersing, not to mention powerful but hidden, this shows that she has a great foundation.\"Alright, I can tell that you have been training diligently and arduously. Your foundations are solid and your talent is top-notch. You are a hard-to-come-by genius!\" After she finishes a punching routine, Zhang Xuan nods his head in satisfaction.He is imitating the fortune tellers from earth. His words are slippery with a great range of interpretation. The ones listening are unable to find a flaw with his words and instead, they will be shocked by how accurate his comments are.\"Especially the strength on your legs, they are just like a coiling dragon. Every movement is just like the raging waters, full of strength. As long as you were to train hard in the future, you would surely have a bright future...\"\"Teacher, my leg is injured. The physician said that it is as good as crippled...\" The girl interrupts his monologue with a look of suspicion in his eyes.\"Injured...\" Zhang Xuan's face turns red. However, he is thick-skinned, so others can't really tell. He continues to bullshit, \"Do you think that I can't tell? I knew it from the moment you exerted your strength! The reason why I said it is because... Through destruction will there be rebirth! Although your leg is injured, you were unexpectedly blessed with an opportunity that no one else expected. As long as you grasp it properly, your legwork will become your greatest strength! Others can only look on with envy!\"Anyway, he is just coaxing her. If he can convince her with bullshit, he will bullshit. The important thing is to get a disciple over to him first.\"Opportunity? Teacher, what kind of opportunity is it?\" The girl's eyes lit up.After her leg was injured, she had always felt that she was inferior to others, causing her to have low self-esteem. She didn't expect to stumble on a fortune due to such a mishap.\"This opportunity can allow you to soar to the top in one go. It won't be difficult for you to become the top of the freshmen. After all, your talents are extraordinary, a genius that has yet to appear in history. However...\" Zhang Xuan's words go on and on. All he is short of now is to take out a 'Buddha's Palm' manual.TL: Kungfu HustleUpon hearing that she is a genius capable of becoming the first among the freshmen, the girl's face blushes furiously and continues questioning, \"However what?\"\"However...\" Zhang Xuan sighs. It is a sigh lamenting that a talent is about to be buried in dirt. \"The teachers who are able to spot such an opportunity don't number many in this academy! Including me, there are only three. The other two has already stopped accepting students from three years ago, so... It would be difficult for me to ask them as well...\"\"Stopped accepting students?\" Initially, the girl had high hopes for it but after hearing those words, her expression turns gloomy. Then, she seems to recall something suddenly and says, \"They aren't accepting students but teacher, are you... accepting?\"\"Of course I am. Just that, you can also tell, I am indifferent to fame and fortune and I don't have much time to spare as well!\" A look of difficulty appears on Zhang Xuan's face. \"If it isn't a good jade, I won't accept it easily even if our paths cross...\"Putong!Before he can finish his words, the girl kneels onto the floor and bows, \"I know that mister is noble, but please accept me as your student! I will train diligently so as to not embarrass you!\"A surge of joy rushes into Zhang Xuan's heart, though his face still maintains a look of difficulty, \"There is destiny between us, just that... You can also tell, I like peace...\"\"As your student, I promise to never interrupt teacher unless it is an emergency!\" Seeing that he is a little unwilling, the girl immediately nods her head with a sincere look on her face.\"I don't have many students, so the resources I have cannot be compared to other teachers. Also, you might be criticized by others...\" Zhang Xuan continues.\"Is that so... I have heard that training resources are important...\" The girl hesitates.The amount of resources a teacher claims from the academy is related to the number of his students, their results and numerous other factors. Without sufficient resources, it is difficult to advance ahead in one's cultivation.\"Cough cough, I only said that to test you. Since you are determined and sincere in acknowledging me as your master, I will reluctantly accept you!\" Looking at her signs of hesitation, Zhang Xuan interrupts her and says, \"Your identity card!\"\"So... so quickly?\"She didn't expect that the teacher would change his face as quickly as flipping the page of a book. The girl is slightly surprised as she grasps the token passed over by Zhang Xuan which represents his identity. Just as she is considering whether she should affirm the relationship, she sees the reticent Teacher Zhang pull her hand over and cuts it with a sharp dagger. A drop of blood falls on the jade token.Weng!Light flashes.\"Ah....\"The girl is a little dumbfounded.Didn't the teacher say that he has to consider carefully about it? Indifferent to fame and fortune, was it? Why is his movement so fast and... even the dagger was prepared beforehand?\"From now on, you are my student!\" After the verification through blood, Zhang Xuan heaves a sigh of relief. Then, he continues to assume his image as a unworldly expert, \"What is your name?\"\"Teacher, I am called Wang Ying!\"Knowing that her decision cannot be revoked, the girl doesn't say anything else and nods her head.\"Un, take your identity token to claim your bedding and your books. Also, look for your lodging while you're at it! We shall begin lessons tomorrow. Meet me here!\"Zhang Xuan flicks his hand.\"Yes!\" Wang Ying nods her head and turns around to leave.\"Huu! I have successfully coaxed one in!\"After confirming that she is his student, Zhang Xuan heaves a sigh of relief and smiles.It really isn't an easy task. If it wasn't for the techniques in acting cool that he learned from the internet, it would be hard for him to succeed today.With one student, he will be able to avoid the misfortune of being expelled. Zhang Xuan feels the burden on his heart disappearing. In a moment, his spirit feels much more relaxed. The obsession that was lingering in his brain disappears gradually.\"Rest easy, now that I am in your body, I will live properly in your stead!\"The previous Zhang Xuan died because he was unable to recruit students, so he held strong regrets in this world. Now that there is a student under him, his final obsession disappears. At this moment, Zhang Xuan could be considered to finally gain complete control over this body.Boom!After gaining full control of this body, Zhang Xuan wants to continue coaxing a few more students over. However, he suddenly feels a tremor in his head as he hears a sound of ancient bells striking in his head.\"The heaven and earth are callous, treating all beings like dogs...\"\"The sun sets and the moon wanes, an imperfection appears in the heaven and earth...\"Boom!All kind of profound adages shocked him giddy. Following which, a giant palace appears before him in his head. On it, four words glow brightly.Library of Heaven's Path!Opening the door, he walks in. Countless bookshelves stand tall and mighty with all kinds of books on them. The end can't be seen at a single glance.\"Could this be the gift pack for transcenders? A library? Damn it, I was a librarian my previous life. It can't be that I would still be the same in this world as well!\"The gift packs of others are old grandfathers, systems or all kinds of overpowered items. Yet, my gift pack is a library? Zhang Xuan could feel the sight before him turning dark and he almost faints.Library? For what? It can't be that in my future fights when other people are throwing swords at me, I would be throwing books?\"Let me see what books are those.\"Feeling helpless, Zhang Xuan reaches out to grab a book from a bookshelf so as to determine the purpose of this library. However, when he stretches out, his hand passes through the bookshelf, causing him to grab thin air.\"Are you playing with me? Giving me a library yet preventing me from grabbing and reading any book, what exactly do you want?\"Zhang Xuan is speechless. An urge to cry overwhelms him but no tears fall out.TL note: Emperor Haotian is a supreme deity of the Han tribe who governs everything under the teachings of ConfucianismNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2: ShamelessTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexAfter looking around for awhile longer, Zhang Xuan realizes that all of the books in the library are just like the moon reflected in the water, it is impossible to retrieve them from the shelves. Thus, he loses interest and his consciousness retreats from his mind.\"Time to eat lunch. After lunch, I will think of a way to coax another two more.\"Looking out the window, it seems to be around noon. Out of the 18 students who came by in the morning, he only managed to get one of them to join him. His acceptance rate is really quite low. He can't continue at this pace in the afternoon. No matter what, he is a transcender. If he is unable to dupe those from the ancient era, how could he proudly say that he came from a world in the age of information?Stretching his back, he walks out of the lecture hall towards the canteen.Just like the high schools from his previous life, the Hongtian Academy's canteen is rather large. Its size is sufficient to allow more than ten thousand students eat in it concurrently. After successfully recruiting a student, his mood lifted. Thus, he orders a few more side dishes and sits by the corner to enjoy his meal.\"Isn't that Teacher Zhang?\"While he is eating happily, a voice sounds out. Lifting his head, he sees a young man gazing at him with a smiling face. His face didn't have a hint of warmth and instead, he emits the feeling of a fake smile.\"Teacher Cao?\" Zhang Xuan recognizes him.Teacher Cao's full name is Cao Xiong. He joined the academy along with him. He likes to compare achievements with others and make use of it as a tool to inflate his ego.The previous owner of the body couldn't take insults, that's why he drunk to his death. This fellow definitely played a big role in exerting such pressure on him.\"Today, the freshmen are reporting at the academy to choose their teachers. How is your recruitment going? Judging by how you still have the mood to be eating here, it should be not bad! Look, these are the students that I have recruited, a total of 12 of them. I am here to bring them for a meal before stationing them at their living quarters!\"Teacher Cao has a look of superiority on his face. He points to the back as he brags openly.No doubts about it, he is here to brag.There isn't any grudge between Zhang Xuan and him. However, since they came into the academy at the same time, it is hard to avoid comparisons between the two of them. Thus, he often made use of him to make himself feel superior.A bunch of youths follows behind him. Every of them has a lively expression on their face as they are curious about the new things here.\"Gentlemen, allow me to introduce to you all. This is Teacher Zhang, a celebrity in our academy. He is the very first teacher to score a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination since the inception of our academy! He created history!\"Teacher Cao introduces to the crowd.\"Zero marks in the Teacher Qualification Examination?\"\"Ah, I have heard of it when I was on the way here. A student he taught went into a frenzy and was almost crippled!\"\"I have heard of it as well. Quite a few people have told me before I came to not choose him as my teacher. Otherwise, not only will I not be able to cultivate, it is also equal to suicide!\"\"I didn't expect that he would be the one. To think that he has such a kind face!\"...Hearing Cao Xiong's introduction, a commotion breaks out among the students.There are many elements to the Teacher Qualification Examination and a total score will be given based on the evaluation of the various aspects. Of it, the students' examination results also play a part in it as well. As long as the teacher has some students, there would bound to be a result. Obtaining zero marks could be considered as making history.\"Are you done with your introduction?\"Towards the commotion of the crowd, Zhang Xuan does not get angry.The one who scored a zero is the previous Zhang Xuan, what does it have to do with him?However, even if he isn't really angry, he is still quite annoyed by the actions of this Teacher Cao who raises his own standing by beating others down. He waves his hand and says, \"After you are done with your introduction, you can scram. Don't interrupt my meal here!\"Cao Xiong didn't expect that this fellow wouldn't feel embarrassed even when his history is revealed. He was even asked to scram away. Cao Xiong's face darkens. He shakes his hand and with the prestige of a teacher, he says, \"For you to score zero points in the Teacher Qualification Examination, you have broken the academy's record. Do you not have a sense of shame?\"\"Shame? Why should I feel ashamed? You have already said it yourself, I have broken the record and became a famous person. All of the freshmen know who I am. However, what about you?\" Zhang Xuan raises his hand and points towards the students behind Zhang Xuan's back. \"How much did you score in the examination? Do they know? Before they even came to the academy, do they know who you are? If it wasn't for your insistence to the extent that you even treated them to food, do you think they will acknowledge you as their teacher? To remain unknown as a teacher, you still dare to brag before me. what the hell are you so proud of!\"\"Ga?\"If other people were to score zero in their Teacher Qualification Examination, their head would definitely remain lowered when they are outside for fear of disgracing themselves. However, this fellow was the direct opposite. He was gleeful about it and held his head up high because of it. Instead, he despises Cao Xiong for not scoring a zero.Cao Xiong is about to explode.His skin is really too thick! The crux of it is... with this kind of results, how can you still be so proud of yourself?The students behind him stare at one another, at a loss of what to do.What about his reputation, his reputation?This teacher... isn't he too shameful!Shame? Thick-skinned? What a joke! In the era that Zhang Xuan lived in, in order to become famous, some celebrities did all kinds of shameful deeds. Whatever you could think of, nude photos and fake news, they don't get embarrassed doing these kinds of stuff. Even if he were to score zero marks for his Teacher Qualification Examination, it doesn't mean a thing compared to the things that those people did.Cao Xiong's face turns red, \"The main job of a teacher is still teaching. Today, I will not squabble with you. Let's cross blows only after you get a student. Then, we'll see whose student is more skilled!\"After saying those words, he turns around to leave.At this point, the conversation between a male and female could be heard behind him.\"That teacher is really not bad. His personality is also good...\"The voice of a dazed girl sounds out. Hesitation could be heard in her tone.\"Second young mistress, listen to my words. Before we headed out, young master has already entrusted me to bring you to Teacher Lu Xun. However, you refuse to listen to me. You even shook me off. Ignoring that, you chose him out of everyone else...\"The voice of an old man sounds out, a tinge of frustration could be heard in his tone.\"That teacher... is not as bad as you said. He... he is a good person, he promised to guide me. He said that... if I were to train properly, I can become the top of the cohort...\" Hesitation could still be heard in the voice of the female.\"You still want to be the top of the cohort. If you were to study under him, it is already a blessing for your cultivation to not go berserk. Second young mistress, do you know who he is? He is the most famous useless teacher in the entire academy. He scored a zero the last Teacher Qualification Examination... My little ancestor, you better hurry up and withdraw your application, otherwise young master would kill me if he were to hear of this...\" A pleading tone appears in the voice of the old man.\"Big brother!\"Hearing the old man talk about the young master, the little girl starts to get frightened. Her face distorts and she falls into a dilemma.Hearing those words, the leaving Cao Xiong's eyes light up as he smiles towards the eating Zhang Xuan. \"Teacher Zhang, could this young lady be the student you just recruited? Haha, looks like it isn't going well for you. She seems to be intending to withdraw as your student!\"Teachers can pick students and similarly, students can also pick their teachers.If a student finds their teacher inappropriate for them, they can return the token given to them.Cao Xiong's loud voice attracts quite a bit of attention. The mistress and servant duo who were discussing gaze over as well.\"Second young mistress, is he the teacher you just acknowledged?\" The old man's gaze falls on Zhang Xuan.\"Yes!\" The young girl nods her head.The old man immediately stands up and walks over to Zhang Xuan, \"Teacher Zhang, the young mistress of our family has decided to withdraw from your lessons!\"\"Old Liu...\" She didn't expect the old man's movements to be so quick. The girl's face flushes red and she hurries over. She looks at Zhang Xuan with a look of apology and says, \"Teacher, I...\"She is the student Zhang Xuan just accepted, Wang Ying.\"Wang Ying, you know that I do not accept students. The reason why I accepted you is because our paths crossed. Why do you want to withdraw and give up on such a good opportunity? Do you know how many people desire to become my student, but I refused them?\"Of course, Zhang Xuan will not allow her, who he coaxed with much difficulty, to escape. Thus, he assumes a very elderly tone.\"What the hell...\"Hearing his words, the ones in the surroundings who are aware of his background feel their vision turning dark and they almost fainted.Big brother, can you at least have a sense of shame? What do you mean by refusing to accept students, paths crossing and many people desiring to be your student... You are obviously the one who can't recruit any student...\"I, this isn't...\"Under his interrogation, Wang Ying immediately waves her hand but before she could finish her words, someone interrupts her.\"Yes!\" Seeing how indecisive his second young mistress is, the old man Uncle Liu steps forward, \"Teacher Zhang, our family's second young mistress has decided to withdraw from your class. She finds it hard to verbalize it out. I will be depending on you for the withdrawal procedures!\"\"Withdraw?\" Zhang Xuan's eyelids twitch. \"You have to consider it properly. You will leave behind a bad reputation from withdrawing from a teacher's class. It will be hard other teachers to accept you! Are you going to ruin your young mistress life just because of your stubbornness? Can you take responsibility?\"\"This...\" Old Liu freezes.Students can withdraw their applications. However, this would be an insult to the teacher. Besides, if you are able to abandon this one, it means you are also able to abandon another one. Normally, this kind of student with 'bad track record' will not be accepted by the other teachers.After all, for someone who has insulted the prestige of the teachers, no one would be willing to accept that kind of students.Besides, accepting the student would mean insulting the teacher to his face. Everyone are colleagues, so it isn't wise for them to offend their peers over a student.Training in the academy, a student can be considered to be ruined if they are unable to find a teacher.Old Liu was still quite determined awhile ago. However, hearing his words, he is put in a difficult position.After all, he is just a servant. If the second young mistress's future were to be delayed over this, he is unable to bear the consequences.\"Rest easy, your family's second young mistress has good talent. I will teach her well, she will definitely score well...\" Seeing that Old Liu is wavering, Zhang Xuan starts to coax him as well.What a joke, how could he allow a cooked duck to fly away!\"Hold it right there, who says that no teacher would dare to accept her? Young lady, if you were to withdraw from this teacher here, I will immediately accept you as my student!\"Before Zhang Xuan could finish his words, Cao Xiong steps forward with his arms spread grandly.He just lost face in front of Zhang Xuan. Now that an opportunity presents itself before him, how could he simply let go of it?\"Cao Xiong, what are you intending to do?\"Zhang Xuan's face darkens.\"Intending to do? Such a good bud, it would be a pity for it to go to waste. If she were to withdraw from your classes, I will immediately accept her! After all, they came to the academy to study, so it is natural for them to choose the best teacher to guide them, and not someone who scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examinations!\"Chuckling, Cao Xiong looks gleeful.\"Poaching students from me publicly, do you think that I won't report this to the Central Education Bureau?\"This isn't just a normal bicker but a public poaching of a student!Although the academy encourages teachers to freely choose their students, they do not pardon this kind of snatching of students! The moment it happens, not only will it affect the relationships between the teacher, it could also affect the culture of the school.\"Poaching students? You speak too heavily. At most, let's have a fair competition advising her by the side. We will let the student choose by herself. Do you dare to agree to it?\"Cao Xiong says.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3: Imperfections in Heaven's PathTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"A live battle between teachers on offering pointers?\"Zhang Xuan's face darkens.Although he has inherited the memories of the previous Zhang Xuan, he has yet to organize the information in his head. At most, he can only make sense out of the different realms in cultivation. If it is on mistakes of cultivation, even the previous Zhang Xuan could only smoke through it, needless to say, the current Zhang Xuan!Guiding others... He is definitely inferior to this Teacher Cao!If they were to really compete, he would surely lose!\"Why? Are you scared to accept the challenge? It is clearly written in the rules that teachers can compete with one another so as to allow the student to make a better choice. This isn't considered as poaching!\" Cao Xiong chuckles. He flings his sleeves and a serene and scholarly look appears on him.\"What do we offer the students pointer on?\"He knows that if he doesn't settle things properly today, the only student he has recruited is going to flee. Zhang Xuan grinds his teeth.There are many aspects for a teacher to guide their students on, such as their cultivation, martial art and mistakes in training... As the teachers differ from one another, their specialty also differs.\"How about this, since they are all new students whom we don't know, how about we have them execute a punching routine, then guide them based on the flaws in their execution. Afterward, we will have a test on the spot and the one whose student improves to a greater extent wins. How about it?\"Against other teachers, Cao Xiong wouldn't have the confidence to challenge them. However, against the one whose performance is first from the bottom, the one who scored zero on the Teacher Qualification Examination, he is still confident of his skills.Zhang Xuan hesitates.\"It can't be that you do not dare to accept? You were still bragging so proudly back there that you refused so many students who wanted you as their teacher. If you possess true abilities, let's compete it out. Don't hinder the future of the young lady!\" Cao Xiong coerces him.\"That... Alright!\"Zhang Xuan nods his head.The worst one thing that can happen to one is death anyway! The worst that can happen now is his loss. If he doesn't accept the duel now, the student he just accepted will definitely withdraw! At this moment, there is nowhere for him to retreat to anymore.If he finds himself unable to make it when it comes down to it later on, he can just make up something random on the spot. Anyway, he has thick skin, so what if it is embarrassing...\"Teacher Cao and Teacher Zhang are competing!\"\"Which of these two teachers on the bottom will win?\"\"That's him!\"\"A teacher who scored zero on the Teacher Qualification Examination still wants to compete with others? Are you for real? Isn't he just looking for embarrassment?\"......Upon accepting the challenge, numerous students who were in the midst of eating came crowding over.Today is the day for the registration of freshmen. Quite a lot of people who came have heard of this teacher who scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination, even though they have yet to meet him in person. Most of them are quite curious how it would turn out.\"Going by the rules, you will guide my student while I will guide yours!\"Seeing people gathering around, Cao Xiong's feels even more motivated to perform. He smiles with his hands open widely.To ensure fairness, competition between teachers disallows them to offer pointers to their own students so as to avoid the suspicion of cheating. Normally, they would exchange students to guide.\"Young lady, come and display your punching routine. Use your full strength to strike the stone pillar!\"After confirming the content and method of the competition, Cao Xiong assumes the look of an unworldly saint and looks towards the dazed young lady.\"I...\"Wang Ying blushes furiously as she peeks at Zhang Xuan. After confirming that he isn't angry, she walks forward. With her hands apart, a leisure aura shrouds her entire body.Huhuhu!The shock wave from the punch causes the wind to whistle. Her punch is full of force.If one doesn't see it personally, they would definitely find it hard to believe that this was a punching routine from the dazed young lady.Her stance is stable and forceful. Just from the looks of it, she has built up a great foundation.Very quickly, the punching routine comes to an end.After seeing the punching routine, Zhang Xuan falls in despair.With his experience, even with the memories from his previous life, he couldn't see any flaws in it at all.No wonder he would score a zero for his Teacher Qualification Examination, his eye to perceive such things is too weak.\"Un, yes your full strength and strike the stone pillar!\"Seeing that she is indeed a good bud, Cao Xiong nods his head in satisfaction and says.A stone pillar stands not too far away from them. It can be used to gauge the strength of the students so that the students would have a better understanding of their own strength.Wang Ying walks shyly over.She turns the strength she gathered from that punching routine earlier into shooting stars and sends a forceful blow over!Peng!The stone pillar staggers and numbers appear on it.53!\"53kg, the strength of your punch is not bad!\" Cao Xiong nods his head in approval.For a freshman who has yet to enter the academy to be guided by the teachers, not to mention she is a female, it is already quite incredible for her to have such weight behind her punch.\"Previously, I have noticed that your punching routine is very vigorous and forceful. However, one flaw with your punches is that your punch route is a little too short. If you can increase the speed of the rotation of your lower limb, its prowess would increase significantly! If I'm not wrong, your legs should be injured!\"Cao Xiong says.As expected of a teacher, his eye to perceive is indeed much better than Zhang Xian's. With just one look, he is able to tell that the crux to Wang Ying's punching routine is the lower limbs and from there, he deduced that she might have been injured.\"Yes!\" Wang Ying nods her head.\"Due to your injury, you are a little hesitant to exert pressure on your lower limbs. Let me impart you a method. Don't worry, it will not worsen the injuries on your legs!\"Following which, Cao Xiong speaks of another new method and explains it thoroughly.\"Let me give it a try!\"For Wang Ying to possess such strength at her age, her comprehension ability isn't weak. It didn't take her long to understand the concepts fully. Then, she steps before the stone pillar again and clenches her fist. A surge of strength fills her entire body and she feels like a powerful dragon.Peng!63!After some simple guidance, her weight of her blows increases by 10kg!\"For her strength to increase by 10kg, that is a 20% increase! I am done with my guidance. It's your time!\"Looking at his result, Cao Xiong smiles faintly, and the glee behind it is apparent.For a student's strength to increase by 20% with just a single session of guidance, this is not a bad result at all.\"Teacher Zhang!\"Afterward, a student walks out from Cao Xiong's back and readies himself to execute his punching routine.\"Hold it right there!\"Zhang Xuan raises his hand.\"Why? Teacher Zhang wants to go against his words?\" Cao Xiong snickers.\"Go against my words? What a joke. Do you think I will regret something that I have agreed upon?\" Zhang Xuan speaks with a forceful tone, but in that instant, his heart panics.As a transcender, how could he possibly know how to guide a student? However, if they want to be guided in the field of downloading and watching romance films, he is an expert.\"I only think that...\" With the crowd looking at every action of his, Zhang Xuan can only bear with the embarrassment while fumbling for a random excuse to escape from the situation. \"He is your student and he listens to your orders. What if he intentionally refuses to exert his full strength after my guidance, won't I lose immediately?\"\"I will definitely use my full strength! At the very least, I still have that little bit of credibility!\" Looking at how Zhang Xuan doubts him, he grinds his teeth.\"Alright, I believe in the credibility of this student. However, our duel isn't fair!\" Now that the student had said those words, Zhang Xuan knows that he would only be mocked if he forcefully pushes his way through on that. Thus, he could only thicken his skin further and find another breakthrough.\"Unfair? What is unfair?\" Cao Xiong says.\"Wang Ying is my student. If I win, she is still my student. What would I earn? On the other hand, if I lose, she would become your student. How can this be considered fair? This is just like in a gamble of life, if I win, you would spare me and if I lose, I would give my life to you... Do you think that this is fair?\" Zhang Xuan says.\"Keng...\" Cao Xiong is at a loss.Now that he puts it that way, it is an unfair challenge.This bet is just like a fraud. While Cao Xiong isn't susceptible to any losses, when the other party loses, he would have to pass his student on to him.\"How about this, if I were to lose, Liu Yang over here will become your student!\"After considering for a moment, Cao Xiong declares with a gesture of his hand.Liu Yang is the freshman who had walked out to be guided by Zhang Xuan.\"Teacher...\" He didn't expect that Teacher Cao would make such a decision. Liu Yang is flabbergasted and a look of anxiety appears on his face.To make him acknowledge a teacher who scored zero in the Teacher Qualification Examinations, he would rather die...\"Don't worry, teacher won't lose!\" Cao Xiong looks at him confidently.\"Yes!\"Seemingly confident in Teacher Cao, Liu Yang walks over and huhuhuhu, regardless of whether Zhang Xuan is looking or not, he begins on his punching routine.\"This...\"Initially, he wanted to say a few more words to make this youth give up. However, seeing how he immediately starts on his punching routine, not even giving him a chance to speak, Zhang Xuan feels a little desolate.To tell the truth, he doesn't even recognize the punching routine of the student, so how could he find a flaw in it? Needless to say, to guide him.\"Flaw, what flaw is there in this punching routine...\"Beads of perspiration flow down his head and anxiety overwhelms him.If he is unable to find a flaw to guide him, embarrassing himself is a small matter. However, the student he took so much trouble to recruit would be gone and he would be expelled from the academy!Boom!Just as he was overwhelmed with anxiety, the Library of Heaven's Path in his mind tremors and the deep rumble of a lightning echoes.Four words appear on top of the bookshelves.Heaven's Path is imperfect!These four words have induces an imposing sensation, as though the mountains. It carries with it boundless prestige and might.The moment the four words are formed, a book appears on the bookshelf and books which are intangible and falls before him.\"What is this?\"Zhang Xuan's heart stops for a moment. He lowers his head to look at the book in his hands.He could only see two words on the cover -- Liu Yang!Casually flipping to the first page, he could see a dense concentration of words written it.\"Liu Yang, originates from the Liu Family from Xiayun City. A student of Hongtian Academy. Fighter 1-dan Juxi Realm!\"\"Cultivation Technique: Lotus Acupoint Breakthrough Might!\"\"Battle Techniques: Soaring Flower Fists (Rookie), Dragon Inch Fist (Expert)!\"Flaws: 12 aspects. No.1, he uses too much strength for his feints... No.2... No.3... No.4...No.12, although his left arm is much stronger, his punching routine is more suited for the right-handed. Thus, he is unable to exert his full strength...\"\"This... This...\"Looking at the densely-filled words on top of it, Zhang Xuan feels as though he is going mad.Is this for real?Just as he is thinking of Liu Yang's flaws, the Library of Heaven's Path compiles a book on his weaknesses.If what is written on it is for real, then the gift package he received as a transcender is simply too overpowered!You must know that everyone has their own flaws. Every martial art and moves have their own flaw. Perfect doesn't exist in this world. To be able to perceive the flaws of a person and compile it into a book, this library is on the verge of breaking through the heavens!Peng!Just as Zhang Xuan is surprised by the changes in the library in his mind, Liu Yang has already completed his punch routine. After a resounding tremor, numbers appear on the stone pillar.\"62!\"The weight behind is punch is 62kg!\"Teacher Zhang, Liu Yang has already finished his demonstration. How about you offer him some guidance?\"Cao Xiong smiles.Hearing those words, those who are watching the commotion by the side gaze towards Zhang Xuan. They want to see how the only teacher who scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination would guide his student.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4: Slapping FaceTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"I...\"The tremor from the Library of Heaven's Path just now caused his attention to be concentrated in his mind and he is still in a dazed state. Furthermore, he doesn't even know what the other person's punching routine is, so how the hell could he guide him!\"Teacher Zhang, please correct my flaws!\"Liu Yang steps forward and bends over completely.By one side, Wang Ying blinks her eyes. She wants to see how this 'expert' she has just met would guide him.\"Keng!\"Everyone's gaze concentrates on him. If he doesn't speak soon, he will only end in embarrassment. Just as Zhang Xuan is about to spout bullshit, he suddenly remembers Liu Yang's flaws that were recorded in the book in the library.He doesn't know whether what is recorded on it is true or not. However, given the situation, it is probably impossible for him to make something up on the spot. Thus, he could only buck up his courage to say, \"There are many flaws in your punch routine, a total of 12 of them!\"\"Haha, he said that there are many flaws in there, 12 of them? I didn't hear wrongly, did I!\"\"This is the funniest joke I have heard!\"\"This Soaring Flower Fist may not be very advanced, but it is one of the most common skills in the entire kingdom and is known as the Basic Fist. After thousands of years of simplification and refining, although it cannot be considered as perfect, he actually says that there are 12 flaws?\"\"A bunch of lies! He probably couldn't discern anything, that's why he decided to make things up!\"......Initially, the surrounding crowd was still pondering over what he could say. The moment he opened his mouth, everyone of them bursts into laughter.Soaring Flower Fist is one of the most basic punching routines of the Tianxuan Kingdom. It is similar to the Taizu Changquan, as long as one is practicing martial arts, they would have to learn it first. After thousands of years of refinement by countless experts, though it doesn't hold much might, but it is well-reputed for its lack of flaws. Even more so, some people call it the 'Flawless Fists'.For such a punching routine, that fellow actually claims that there are 12 flaws in it... What kind of joke is it!Ignoring the fact that he scored zero for his Teacher Qualification Examination, even if the principal were to come over, he probably won't be able to point out so many flaws!\"Oh? Teacher Zhang sure is a genius, to be able to find 12 flaws in the Soaring Flower Fists. Do enlighten us!\"Apparently, Cao Xiong didn't expect Zhang Xuan to be so boastful and to say such words the moment he opens his mouth. Excited, his eyes twinkled. He purposely said those words to push Zhang Xuan into a corner.Even despite hearing the words from the crowd, Zhang Xuan remains expressionless. However, his heart couldn't help but beat erratically. He didn't expect that the Liu Yang fellow would use a punch routine everyone is aware of.His previous self would definitely be aware of it. However, given that he just transcended over, the other person's memory has yet to fully merge with his!However, even though he is a librarian in his previous life, he is still a transcender with an entirely different set of knowledge. Not to mention, his skin is thick. After rolling his eyes, he says, \"Why, you don't believe it? It isn't that I don't want to guide him, but that you all do not trust me. Since you don't want to do as I guided you to... Then, you all can't blame me for it! Wang Ying, let's go. This kind of gamble is pointless!\"\"Hold it there, we trust you! Do enlighten us!\"Seeing that he is on the verge of leaving, Cao Xiong immediately stops him.He can tell that the other party is intentionally coming up with exaggerated figures so that other people would refuse to trust him and he could make use of this opportunity to sneak away. However, it wasn't easy for him to grasp hold of this opportunity to teach him a lesson, so how could he give up at this point!\"That...\"Seeing that he is unable to sneak away, Zhang Xuan can only take out the book compiled by the library once again.\"If I die, so be it!\"Since there's no backing out now, he stares at the flaws recorded in the book and looks through the 12 of them once again. Then, his gaze falls on the last one. He grinds his teeth and speaks, \"The punch routine you just used is right-handed. Let me give you a suggestion. Try using your left hand to strike the stone pillar!\"Since it is a special privilege granted to a transcender, there is a chance it could be correct. Besides, even if the information on it isn't accurate, he can't think of a better reason to worm his way out at this point.\"Try using the left-handed version?\"\"This can be also considered as guidance?\"\"What kind of joke is this. One's left hand is normally weak. If he were to execute it with his left fist, won't he be screwing up the entire punch routine?\"......The crowd first stuns before a commotion breaks out. All of them stares at Zhang Xuan with looks of despise.Everyone knows that the left-hand is weaker than the right. Given the shock wave from the fist Liu Yang just executed, he obviously isn't left-handed. Yet now, to ask him to execute it with his left hand... What kind of joke is this?\"Liu Yang, try using Teacher Zhang's method so that he can give it up!\"Apparently, Cao Xiong didn't expect Zhang Xuan to say that. He is so excited that he is on the verge of skipping with joy but he still yells a command to Liu Yang.Even though he just accepted him as a student, he is extremely sure that Liu Yang is more skilled with his right and that he isn't a left-handed. If he were to really execute it that way, the force behind it probably wouldn't even hit 30kg!For a student to hit 62kg before guidance and before 30kg after guidance, this will definitely cause Zhang Xuan's reputation to fall to the gutters!Let's see whether he can still remain so smug!\"Yes!\" Liu Yang snickers coldly and executes the punch routine again.He is very aware of the fact that he isn't left-handed. To get him to execute the blow with his left-hand... A load of bullshit.Soaring Flower Fist is the basic fist he has been practicing since young. Although he isn't very used with the inversion of left and right, he soon got over it. Even though the shock wave from the fist creates a strong gale, regardless of whether it is his strength or proficiency, it seems to be worse than the previous one.\"Could it be... my privilege as a transcender is a sham?\"Zhang Xuan is very nervous.Other people's privilege when they transcend includes an old grandfather who could just casually enlighten them. As long as they were to follow his instruction devotedly, there would bound to be no problems. Yet, he just has to get a library with all sorts of messy things written in the book. If what is written in the book is false, he would definitely get expelled from the school!Hu!Very quickly, he finishes the routine. Liu Yang walks over to the stone pillar and raising his left fist, he smashes it in.Weng!A series of digits appear.\"One. Haha, to think it would be in the tens...\"When the digit '1' appears on it, Cao Xiong bursts into laughter as an exhilarated expression appears on his face. However, before he could finish his words, they got stuck in his throat. His eyeballs are about to fall onto the ground.\"123?\"\"123kg?\"The crowd who had intended to mock him are scared foolish and they tremble uncontrollably.Previously, Liu Yang's blow did 62kg and now that it has risen to 123kg, that is almost a single fold! That is... almost a 100% increase!Is that for real?Even the teacher who scored first in the Teacher Qualification Examination throughout the campus, during his first guidance, can't possibly cause his student's result to increase by a single fold!\"I... I... Is this from me?\"Even the person in question, Liu Yang, is stunned.He stares foolishly at the rock pillar in disbelief.He knows that he isn't left-handed. However, never could he imagine that his left strength would hold so much strength! That is a single fold compared to his right!The crowd is astonished. Zhang Xuan almost leaps from all the joy surging through his body.\"It's true!\"At this instant, he can finally confirm that the flaws compiled by the library are true.To be able to see through the skills a person is cultivating in and his weakness... This privilege of a transcender is really going to bash through the heavens!\"So, how was it? Your guidance has led to a 20% improvement while mine has led to a 100% improvement. Teacher Cao, what else do you want to say?\" Zhang Xuan snickers.\"I...\" Cao Xiong's face turns pale as he feels a burning sensation on his face.Initially, he proposed this competition to see the other party make a fool out of himself. In the end, the one who was made a fool of is himself.Retrieving a jade token from his embrace, he bites on his finger and a drop of fresh blood falls on it. \"Liu Yang, I am revoking your status as my student. You can now acknowledge Teacher Zhang as your teacher!\"After saying that, he glances at Zhang Xuan, \"You don't have to be too smug about it. This time, you were lucky. The next time we compete, I will make sure that your reputation is ruined...\"Then, he turns around to leave.This time, not only did his reputation take a blow, he lost a student and even got slapped hard on his face.It is one thing to lose to other teachers. However, the main crux of the problem is that this fellow is the one who scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination, the worst teacher in the entire academy...\"Teacher, teacher...\"Watching as Cao Xiong departs, Liu Yang's face darkens.Although he managed to achieve a good result under Zhang Xuan's guidance, he, like Cao Xiong, believes that it was only luck. He doesn't believe that he would have this kind of skills.\"Alright, you are now my student. Hurry up and take out your identity card!\"Zhang Xuan doesn't care what he is thinking about. A victory in a bet has given him a new student, so he is still busy celebrating over it. He casually tosses a jade token over.Although Liu Yang isn't really willing to become his student, he knows that he has to give into the results of the bet. If he doesn't acknowledge this Zhang Xuan as his teacher, the other teachers would definitely reject him. Thus, he could only drip his blood onto this jade token to complete the verification.\"Tomorrow, meet here for lessons!\"After finish dealing with Liu Yang, Zhang Xuan doesn't say anything excessive. He looks at Wang Ying and said those words faintly before walking out of the canteen.Returning back to his lecture hall, Zhang Xuan delves into his mind without second thoughts to examine the Library of Heaven's Path closely.After examining for awhile, he finally understands a thing or two about it.As long as the person executes his skill or martial art before him, it would immediately compile into a book of their flaws.\"Haha, I have really struck it rich this time! With this thing in my hand, I would be able to see through any flaws at one go. I don't believe that I will still score a zero for the next Teacher Qualification Examination!\"Frenzied joy races through his heart. As a transcender, Zhang Xuan finally feels some enthusiasm for the future.Taizu Changquan -> Literally means Ancestor Long Fist.A brief introduction of Long Fist: It is a close-combat skill which emphasises stretching one's limbs to the maximum. It is a high aggressive style whose motto is 'the best defense is a long offense' (Source: Wikipedia)Taizu Changquan is known as one of the 6 Great Long Fists in China. There are multiple names to it (depending on the region) but it is well-established and influenced the creation of many other fists in the future, thus giving it the title of 'Mother of a Hundred Fists' (Source: Baidu)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5: Young MistressTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Have you heard? Cao Xiong laoshi had just competed with the academy's number one teacher from the bottom, Teacher Zhang Xuan!\"\"They competed? Then, won't Zhang Xuan laoshi lose for sure?\"\"Unexpectedly, that wasn't so. Zhang Xuan laoshi won! He casually guided a student and made his strength increase by one fold!\"\"Increase by one fold? In his first guidance? Even Lu Xun laoshi wouldn't be capable of doing that! Are you for real?\"\"A lot of people witnessed it for themselves, so how could it not be real?\"......Those who witnessed the competition in the canteen are discussing over it excitedly.\"For the student's strength to increase by one fold in the first guidance?\" Zhao Ya scoffs. \"It is definitely just luck!\"Baiyu City is the third biggest city in the Tianxuan Kingdom and Zhao Ya is the daughter of its City Lord. From young, she has been put through top class education and her motive for coming to Hongtian Academy is to be accepted as Lu Xun's student.However, she didn't expect to hear that Lu Xun would be inferior to Zhang Xuan before she even found him. Naturally, she doesn't believe such rumors.\"Luck? I don't think that it is luck. After all, it is an increase by an entire fold! Just luck itself won't explain it!\" A student sitting not too far away from her couldn't help but respond to her words.\"You think that it isn't luck? Don't think that I do not recognize that Zhang Xuan laoshi. He is the one who scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination and almost got fired! What capabilities do you think a guy like that would possess? If you do not believe my words, I can unmask his facade right here and now!\"Zhao Ya has had an impatient personality since young. Upon hearing someone praise the worst teacher in the academy, she immediately bellows.\"Fine! We also want to know whether the teacher is just all talk!\"Instantly, two students stand up.The three of them walked out of the canteen and after asking around, they found Zhang Xuan's classroom. Pushing open the door, they walked in.\"You are Zhang Xuan laoshi?\"Walking into the classroom, they see the young man sitting on the teacher's seat smiling foolishly to himself. No matter how they look like it, he doesn't seem like an impressive teacher. In fact, they started to feel uncomfortable.\"That's me!\"After noticing the entry of a few students, Zhang Xuan stopped analyzing the Library of Heaven's Path and turns over to look at them.\"We've heard that you have won in a competition against Cao Xiong laoshi and the student you guided had an increase in strength by one fold.\" Zhao Ya states with clear disbelief in her tone. \"Good. Then I would like you to guide me as well, to see whether you can increase my strength by one fold as well!\"\"I'm not free!\"Zhang Xuan waves them away.Teachers also have their own pride as educators. They aren't performers who would perform to the will of the audience. How could they just guide others just because they want them to?Besides that, what's with your attitude? It's not like I owe you something.\"Not free? Aren't you very idle right now?\" Zhao Ya could tell that the other party is just trying to shake her off. She grinds her teeth in anger.She told her friends that she would come and expose his facade, yet right now, she is being chased away without even getting a glimpse at his abilities. She feels embarrassed.\"I have to recruit students. I don't have the effort to fool around with an arrogant little girl!\" Zhang Xuan says calmly.\"You...\" Zhao Ya is so furious that her beautiful eyes roll around.She is the daughter of a city lord, not to mention she is blessed with good looks. No matter where she goes, people look at her with eyes of admiration. However, not only did this fellow reject her, he even said that she was fooling around. How hateful!Even if he is a teacher, this is unforgivable!\"What must we do for you to guide us?\" Grinding her jade-like teeth, Zhao Ya questions.\"Acknowledge me as your teacher!\" Zhang Xuan replies calmly, as he looks at Zhao Ya with a bizarre expression.Seeing how the other party is looking at her as though she is an idiot, Zhao Ya staggers, \"Fine, I will acknowledge you as my teacher. However... If you were to teach me erroneously or give me bullshit, I will expose your lies!\"\"Zhao Ya!\"\"You can't! If you were to take him as your teacher, you won't be able to become Lu Xun laoshi's student...\"The two friends who came with her almost fainted upon hearing her acceptance of his request. They immediately try to persuade her.Hearing the persuasion of her two friends, Zhao Ya hesitates.She is aware of the school rules. After becoming a teacher's student, if the student wants to acknowledge another teacher, they would have to first withdraw from the lessons of their current one. However, if they were to do so, the other teacher would tend to reject the student. Not to mention, a popular teacher like Lu Xun.\"You don't have the guts to? If you don't dare to, just hurry up and leave. Don't hold up my business... Recruiting new students!\" Zhang Xuan waves her away.\"Who says that I do not have the guts to?\"She was still hesitating but upon hearing Zhang Xuan's words, Zhao Ya immediately explodes. Her eyebrows frown and she says, \"I will acknowledge you as my teacher right now! Let's verify our relationship!\"\"You attitude is too bad. Even you want me as your master, I don't want to accept you!\" Zhang Xuan waves her away yet again.It is natural to want to recruit obedient students, just like the previous Wang Ying. However, the current one seems to be on gunpowder. Even if he lacks student, he is unwilling to admit her in.\"You...\"She didn't expect that when she chose to bear with it to acknowledge him as her teacher, he still refused to accept her. Zhao Ya can feel flames arising from her.She came here specially to expose his fraud. If she were to stomp away furiously now, wouldn't she be falling into his trap?Perhaps, this fellow is intentionally trying to chase her away so that his fraud cannot be exposed.She is adamant to not allow things go his way!\"Hmph, I will just admit it as my fault first then. After I expose your true face, see how I will put you in place!\"Thinking so, Zhao Ya suppresses the rage in her heart. She smiles faintly, exposing her white teeth, \"Teacher, don't get angry. I was disrespectful! I sincerely wish to become your student, may I plead with you to accept me!\"\"This is more like it!\" Seeing her change in attitude, Zhang Xuan nods his head. \"I can accept you as my student. Before that, I would like you to clean this room. I don't want to see a speck of dust here. Also, help me tidy up the washroom outside. Scrub the toilet bowls clean. Afterward, I will check on it. If I am satisfied with your work, I will admit you in under my tutelage!\"\"Don't go too far!\"Zhao Ya is about to go on a rampage.What is her identity? She is the daughter of a city lord, a daughter of a noble. From young, she has never done any household chore before, and yet this fellow intends for her to sweep the room? Even... cleaning the washrooms? Scrub the toilet bowls?Is he insane?\"If you can't even do such superficial tasks, you can leave right now. I don't need lazy and useless students!\" Zhang Xuan says.Hehe, little lass. You want to play with me? You are still much too inexperienced!\"Who says that I am useless! I will clean up now, I will scrub now!\" Zhao Ya grinds her. Grabbing a broom and mop, she starts to tidy up the room.\"Zhao Ya, how about we just forget about it...\"\"I don't think he is really capable. He is purposely making things hard for you...\"The two friends who tagged along with her, upon seeing the young mistress of a city lord starting to clean up the place, they are all horrified and quickly attempt to convince her otherwise.\"Both of you wait outside first. Since young, I, Zhao Ya, have never really lost before. Today, I have decided to go all out against him!\" Zhao Ya frowns.\"That...\"Her two friends understand Zhao Ya's temper. Seeing that she can't be persuaded, the both of them look at each other, at a loss of what to do.\"Inform butler Yao, didn't he come as well? If the butler were to know that the fellow who scored zero for his Teacher Qualification Examination was ordering young mistress to scrub the toilet bowl, he would definitely stop him!\"After staring at each other for a moment, one of them came up with a solution.For a person of Zhao Ya's identity, even though there weren't any threats on the journey to the academy, there was still someone who escorted her. The person who escorted her was butler Yao. Presently, he should still be around the academy.\"Alright, let's look for him now!\"Without any hesitation, the two of them immediately rush out of the academy.For Zhao Ya who has a stubborn temper just like any other daughters of rich households, even though she has never done household chores before, it didn't take her long to adapt to it. Swiftly, the interior of the room became clean. Even the washroom outside is sparkling.\"Not bad!\" Zhang Xuan nods his head in satisfaction.\"You should be satisfied now. You can admit me as your student and guide my cultivation now, right?\"After finishing her work, Zhao Ya crushes her teeth together 'luo luo!'. Her jade-like face distorts as she tries to hold herself back from punching the guy in front of her.\"Un, your identity card!\"Disregarding the other party's murdering gaze, Zhang Xuan throws a jade token to her casually.Taking a deep breath, Zhao Ya drips a drop of blood on it, verifying their relationship.\"Zhang laoshi, now that I can your student, can you give me a pointer or two?\"Now that she is on the verge of accomplishing her objective, revealing the true face of the despicable man before her, Zhao Ya suppresses the excitement in her heart and asks.\"Display fighting technique to me first, so that I can gauge your fundamentals!\" Zhang Xuan beckons.\"Yes!\"Without any nonsense, Zhao Ya clasps her hands together and bows before executing her skills.Huhuhuhu!The wind howls. Her blow is full of might. As a female as well, her blows are much faster and stronger than Wang Ying. With a single look, it is apparent that she put quite a bit of effort into her training.While looking at Zhao Ya execute her skill, Zhang Xuan's mind is currently in the library. As expected, with a light tremor, a book falls from the shelves.The two words 'Zhao Ya' are written on the cover.\"Zhao Ya, the daughter of the City Lord of Baiyu City. Fighter 1-dan Juxi Realm Pinnacle!\"\"Cultivation Technique: White Jade Pure Maiden Skill!\"......Weakness: 27 flaws. No.1, her personality is rash and she is easily angered. This goes against the White Jade Skill's nature of calmness and smoothness, so she is unable to bring out its full strength. No.2...\"The book is just like what he saw previously. It records all of the flaws and deficiencies in Zhao Ya's cultivation.Peng! Peng! Peng!After a short moment, Zhao Ya completes the entire punch routine. Clenching her feminine hands, she turns around and sends a blow towards the rock pillar in the classroom that is used for measuring the strength of one's blow!A crisp sound. A set of number appears on it.110!\"Not bad, not bad!\" Zhang Xuan can't help but nod his head.To be capable of wielding such strength in her fist before coming to the academy, Zhao Ya is indeed the daughter of a City Lord, holding extraordinary strength.\"Alright, give me some pointers!\"After executing her skill, her face doesn't turn red nor does she gasp for breath. Zhao Ya turns to look at Zhang Xuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6: What Did You Do To Our Young MistressTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexFinishing what that has to be done, Zhao Ya is ready to see the fellow before her make an embarrassment out of himself.Suddenly, an idea comes to mind and a Record Crystal appears in her sleeves.Record Crystal, it is an object capable of recording video and audio in its surrounding. She intends to use it as 'evidence' of Zhang Xuan's wrongdoing! This way, he would be unable to talk his way out of it when she spreads word about his crime.\"Let's see how you would be humiliated then. To think that you would dream of competing with Lu Xun laoshi, dream on!\"Upon the thought that she would be able to grab hold of 'evidence' on him soon to punish him and vent her frustration, Zhao Ya's eyes glitter and she almost failed to control her laughter. Suppressing her happiness, just as she was waiting to see what nonsense the other party would come up with, a pair of clear eyes reminiscent of lanterns appear right in front of her.\"AH...\"Zhao Ya leaps in shock and backs away hurriedly. Only then did she realize that it is Zhang Xuan laoshi. She grinds her teeth in anger and exclaims, \"What are you doing?\"\"Relax, I am just taking a look!\" With his hands behind him, he circles around Zhao Ya, shaking his head. Then, he suddenly stops before Zhao Ya with less than one chi between them.i.e. 33.3cmShe can feel the warmth from his body. Zhao Ya's face blushes. From young, there hasn't been a single man who has been in such proximity with her. Her heart beats furiously. Then, she hears an unhurried voice saying, \"You are sick!\"Hearing those words, Zhao Ya almost erupts and faints on the spot. \"You are the one that is sick, your entire family is sick...\"She is on the verge of going crazy.What's wrong with this fellow's brain. She executed a set of martial arts for him to point out the flaws in them. Instead, this fellow says that she is sick. How can such a vile person exist in the world!\"Why did you start hurling insults?\" Zhang Xuan frowns. Soon, he understands what other meanings his words could hold and smiles faintly, \"I am saying that your body is sick, I am not insulting you!\"\"I am not sick!\" Zhao Ya humphs coldly. \"In my opinion, you are the one who is sick! Something is wrong with your brain!\"She is as strong as an ox. A single fist of hers has a strength of more than 100kg behind it. She is very clear on the fact whether she is sick or not.\"Don't refute my words first. Do you often feel a vague pain in your danzhong and jujue acupoint? Especially on the night of a full moon, when the humid wind blows, a faint red tinge will appear on your body and you will like...\" At this point, Zhang Xuan hesitates for a moment, as though it is difficult to verbalize it out. He continues, \"No matter how you train, you feel like your heart won't calm down?\"TL: Danzhong is an acupoint in the center of an horizontal line that passes through your two nipples. Jujue is just below the center of your ribcage.\"How... How did you know?\"The furious Zhao Ya had intended to refute every word that the other party would say directly, but after hearing those words, her face turns red and she stupefies.It isn't that the words he said are incorrect, but they are simply... too correct!Recently during training, she would feel a faint pain in her danzhong and jujue, although she would just bear it since the pain isn't severe. The crux of the problem is that... On the night of a full moon, when the cold wind blows, her body would turn weird. A strong desire would surge through her body as it turns red. Unable to suppress her raging emotions, she would find herself craving the embrace of a man...She is just a sixteen to seventeen year old young lady who has yet to undergo the matrimony of human bodies so she was unable to tell what that emotion is. She only feels embarrassed by it. Initially, she thought that she could just bear with it and it would pass. However, these feelings became more and more intense. As her body develops and her chest becomes more and more fleshed out, she felt those tendencies getting more and more uncontrollable.In the past, she could deal with it with just two circulations of her cultivation technique. But now, even ten times wasn't enough for the urges to subside. She could only halt with her training until the sun rises.As this affair is really too bizarre, she doesn't dare to tell anyone about it. Even her best friends and her City Lord father is kept in the dark!Despite it being a matter no one knows about... How did this fellow find out about it?It is also due to her being unable to bear it that she came to the academy in a hope to find the crux of the problem and solve it once and for all.\"I am a teacher. I could tell from the punch routine you executed just now!\" Zhang Xuan replies calmly.Of course, it is impossible to tell this much through looking at one's punch routine. The Library of Heaven's Path is an extraordinary treasure. As long as she possesses flaws, even if these flaws have nothing to do with her skills, it would be recorded in it.Exactly because he had seen her problems, that's why Zhang Xuan had a bizarre look on his face.\"Is there... a solution?\"Zhao Ya clenches her jaws and asks with a reddened face.After she was so resolute to expose the fraud of the party, she ended up having her problems exposed by him in an instant. It made her feel embarrassed.\"There is a method to resolving it. Come to class tomorrow and I will explain it to you!\"Zhang Xuan gestures with his hands.\"Really?\"Zhao Ya's eyes light up in disbelief.She is very aware of the problems in her body. Due to her inability to control those raging desires, it caused her became irritable and impatient in everything she does. Initially, she thought she could only conceal this matter in her heart and that there is no way to solve this problem. However, never would she ever dream that this teacher who is the last in the entire academy would be able to uncover it in just a few words.Furthermore... he has a solution to treat it!\"If you don't trust me, you can look for other teachers in the academy!\" Zhang Xuan flings his hand with an indifferent expression, the look of an expert.\"No, no... Teacher, you are the only one!\" Zhao Ya hurriedly nods her head.It hasn't been just a day or two since the start of her suffering. Countless physicians in the city couldn't tell what is wrong with her. Even her father, City Lord Zhao wasn't able to tell that there is something amiss with her. Yet, this Zhang Xuan laoshi could tell with just one look. Just comparing their eyes of discernment, none of these people could compete with him!That is exactly the reason why she thinks that he would have a way to treat her problem.\"That Record Crystal, do you still intend to keep it?\"Zhang Xuan points at her sleeves.\"Ah....\"Zhao Ya is horrified. Only now does she recall the Record Crystal she intentionally left behind so as to get evidence on him. If the contents of the conversation were to leak out, how can she continue to walk with her head held up high?\"I don't, I don't...\"Exerting some force with her palm, 'kacha', the Record Crystal is reduced to dirt.After destroying the crystal, Zhao Ya glances at Zhang laoshi once again. This time, his face doesn't look so hateful. Rather, it is an enigmatic face.Despite concealing the Record Crystal so discreetly, she still got caught. Not to mention, the problems with her body were exposed by him. How could someone of such capabilities score a zero on the Teacher Qualification Examination?\"He must be indifferent to fame and reputation, apathetic to the views of outsiders! I have heard that experts are all like that...\"When this idea appears in her head, Zhang Xuan's position in her heart evolves from a swindler to one of the top experts in the world.\"Take your identity token to claim your bedding and your books. Also, look for your lodging while you're at it. We shall start lessons punctually tomorrow...\"Seeing that another student has been reeled, Zhang Xuan waves his hand as he passes down instruction to her. Suddenly, a loud roar can be heard from the outside and in a flash, a human figure rushes in.Hu!The person who entered is a middle-aged man. He carries a ferocious aura with him as he enters into the classroom. From a single look, one can tell that he isn't weak.\"Young mistress!\"After entering the door, the middle-aged man stops and bows to Zhao Ya.\"Uncle Yao, why are you here?\"Zhao Ya stares at him blankly.This isn't anyone else but the butler from Baiyu City whom her two friends went to invite, Yao Han!Just as he was about to leave after sending Zhao Ya to the academy, her two friends rushed over to inform him that the young mistress wants to acknowledge the fellow who scored a zero on the Teacher Qualification Examination as her teacher and that he even ordered the young mistress to scrub the toilet bowls...Hearing those words, butler Yao Han almost exploded on the spot.Young mistress, the apple of the eye of the City Lord! At home, no one dares to order her around. To dare to get her to sweep the floor and scrub the toilet bowls... He is too audacious!If this fellow is one of the more reputable teachers in the academy, he could drop the matter since they tend to be pickier. The crux of the problem is that... This fellow was the last in the Teacher Qualification Examination, not to mention he even drove a person berserk...How can the young mistress study under someone like that?Even in the city, the people who guided her, even if casually, are much stronger than this person over here!\"Young Mistress, are you...\" Staring coldly at Zhang Xuan, Yao Han quickly glances at the young mistress.\"I have already acknowledged Zhang laoshi as my teacher!\" Zhao Ya declares.Running here with his full strength, he didn't think that he would still be a step too slow. Yao Han's face darkens as he pulls Zhao Ya to his back. He stares at Zhang Xuan coldly, \"Quickly withdraw our young mistress from your tutelage! Then, apologize! Otherwise, when I blow this matter up, everyone will know that you bewitched an underage lady as a teacher to get her to come under your tutelage!\"\"Bewitched an underage lady? Isn't your use of phrase a little too much!\" Zhang Xuan shakes his head.If others were to hear such words, they would think that he had done something towards Zhao Ya. The heavens can serve as his witness that all he has done was to accept a student, it is an extremely pure action...\"Don't play around with me. The young mistress of our family is a talented genius. She isn't someone a person of your qualification can teach. If you were to remove her from your lessons now, I can choose to just let this pass. Otherwise, I will definitely bring this up to the principal and have you fired...\"Yao Han howls. However, before he could finish his words, Zhao Ya interrupts him from his back.\"Uncle Yao! What are you doing! I have acknowledged Zhang laoshi as my teacher of my own free will, why are you causing trouble for me?\"Zhao Ya stomps her feet.The reason why she came to the academy was to solve the problem with her body. She is still happy over the fact that the teacher before her assured her that he would be able to help her, and yet this fellow here comes to mess it up. What the heck is he doing?\"Of your own free will?\" Yao Han glances at the young mistress. \"Do you think that he can really give you guidance that would allow your strength to surge?\"The young mistress is a proud person, he knows that well. Could it be that this teacher who is reputed as trash is able to guide her? That's why she acknowledged him?\"Allow my strength to surge? That he didn't do...\" Zhao Ya shakes his head.The other party only pointed out her illness, he didn't guide her on her cultivation.\"No? Then...\" Yao Han is baffled.\"Alright, Uncle Yao, stop asking!\" Recalling her own illness, Zhao Ya's face turns red.Seeing the young mistress behaving like that, Yao Han stares blankly in confusion. Then, when he sees the shattered Record Crystal on the floor, his face turns frosty and in a split moment, he seems to have turned into a rampaging lion.\"You darned brat, what did you do to our young mistress? Did you think that I wouldn't dare to kill you right now...\"Boom!In his rage, a powerful aura surges forth and the wind howls. 'Jiya', the ground creaks in agony as though it is unable to bear the heavy pressure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7: You Were Dumped BeforeTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"What did I do?\"Upon seeing at the other party seethe with rage, Zhang Xuan is speechless.Isn't this misunderstanding getting a little out of hand!However, he can understand that it is natural for others to think that way. After all, without guiding her cultivation, he was able to make their young mistress willingly acknowledge him as her master and she even blushed upon bringing up the subject. What's more, the Record Crystal had been shattered. That's obvious an act of evidence destroying...All of these show that there's something amiss with the situation.Zhang Xuan is immediately labeled as a weird uncle, a sex maniac, a shameless teacher and other similar titles.\"Uncle Yao, what are you thinking? If you are going to continue behaving like this, I will never bother with you again!\"Looking at the furious Yao Han and hearing his words, how can she not know what is going through his mind? Her face immediately darkens as she exclaims.After all, she is a young lady. This kind of rumors would ruin her reputation.\"Young mistress...\"Interrupted by Zhao Ya, Yao Han could only withdraw his aura.\"Alright, follow me to collect my bedding. Don't hold me up here, I still have lessons tomorrow.\" Zhao Ya harrumphs and walks out of the room.She is unwilling to talk about her illness. If she were to reveal it to him, he would definitely pressure her to talk about it. Under this kind of situation, how could she possibly talk about it?Thus, unable to come up any other excuses, she could only claim to have willingly acknowledged Zhang Xuan as her teacher.\"Hmph!\"After seeing the young mistress turning around to leave the room, Yao Han glances at Zhang Xuan coldly with a glint in his eye, seeming to be contemplating over something. Then, with a fling of his arm, he turns around and walks out.At this moment, the intention to kill that young man lingers in his mind. If they weren't in the academy and the young mistress didn't stop him, he would have long made his move.\"Who did I offend this time...\"Looking at the Yao Han's cold gaze, Zhang Xuan feels perplexed.I only accepted a student, do you have to go this far...He made it seem as though I am an unpardonable criminal who is the source of all evil in this world. The problem is that... he didn't do anything at all!\"Forget it, there is still time left today. Let's see if I can recruit a few more student! The more students under my tutelage, the more resources I will receive!\"There are many different levels to the teachers of Hongtian Academy. Every year, an assessment of the teachers would be conducted based on the conditions of their students. The number of the student they have, the pace of their improvement, their results in all kinds of competitions... The teachers are reliant on these to be promoted.The higher their level, the resources a teacher would get would increase exponentially. Naturally, the same goes for the resources their student would receive as well.This is probably what it means by the teacher and the students advancing as one.Right now, he has only accepted three students. He might be able to retain his position as a teacher, but if one were to talk about qualifications, he is still the last in the entire school!In order for him to advance, he could only continue recruiting more students...........................................\"Zhang Yang, don't be too disappointed! Wang Chao laoshi was the only one who rejected you, you don't have to be so depressed!\"Two youths are walking on the pavement in the academy. The youth in front is currently trying to console the one behind.\"Mo Xiao, you were accepted, of course you don't feel anything saying those words. How about you try getting rejected!\" Zheng Yang frowns, unhappy at his friend's words of consolation.\"Cough cough, don't say that. There are still a lot of excellent teachers in the academy, there isn't a need for you to choose Wang Chao laoshi out of them all!\"The youth in front scratches his head in embarrassment.\"There's no need to choose him? It is easy for you to say. Since young, we have been training in the way of the spear and the spear has already become a part of our body. It is something we are unable to discard anymore. The best teacher in the art of the spear in Hongtian Academy is Wang Chao laoshi. Now that you were accepted by him while I was rejected, is it possible for me to not get depressed?\"Zheng Yang rages.\"That...\" Mo Xiao didn't know how he should reply to such a question.In Hongtian Academy, different teachers have different specialization. Some of them specialize in fists while some of them specialize in sabers... Wang Chao laoshi is well-known for his capability in imparting the way of the spear. He is considered as one of the better teachers even considering the entire academy.The both of them joined the examinations together in a hope to become his disciples. However, one of them passed while the other one failed. It is natural that the one who failed would feel gloomy.\"Hmm, there is a classroom there. How about we take a look!\"Unsure about how he should resolve this awkward situation, Mo Xiao suddenly sees a classroom not too far away and points towards it.\"I'm not going...\" Zheng Yang shakes his head.\"Let's go and take a look. What if this teacher is also skilled in imparting the way of the spear as well?\" Mo Xiao consoles. \"Anyway, you have nothing to lose just by visiting it!\"\"Alright!\" Although he is unwilling, Zheng Yang still follows Mo Xiao into the room.The person inside the room in Zhang Xuan. He is just about to go outside to recruit some fresh blood when he sees two youths walking in.\"Nice to meet you, teacher!\" Mo Xiao bows.\"Un!\" Zhang Xuan widens his eyes slightly. \"Are you here to look for a teacher?\"\"Yes, this is my brother. He is extremely formidable, especially with his spear. In the younger generation, there are few who can compete against him. I hope that teacher can guide him!\" Mo Xiao says hurriedly.\"Mo Xiao...\" Zheng Yang pulls the sleeves of his good brother.\"What is it?\" Mo Xiao asks in confusion.\"Look at the surroundings...\"Zheng Yang frowns.This classroom is extremely narrow. From the looks of it, it could only fit ten people or so. It is obviously a small classroom.The size of the classroom is representative of the capability of the teacher. The teachers who are ranked in the top few have classrooms the size of a field, allowing more than hundreds of students to cultivate and train at the same time. In comparison to that, this classroom is just like the size of a palm. The teacher of this classroom is probably only of average standard.\"It's indeed quite small...\" Mo Xiao notices the size of the room and his heart beats, 'ge deng!'.Initially, he wanted to help soothe the stifled emotions in his best friend's heart. Yet, unwittingly, he came to this kind of location. If the teacher's standard is really sub par, not only will the stifled emotions not disappear, it might even weigh heavier on his heart.\"Demonstrate your ability with the spear!\"Seemingly oblivious to the secret conversation taking place between the two, Zhang Xuan says calmly.\"Since we came here, we might as well have this teacher guide you for a bit, since there's nothing to lose. If his standard is really bad, we could just refuse to acknowledge him and leave!\" Seeing the look of hesitation on Zheng Yang's face, Mo Xiao persuades him.\"Un!\" Zheng Yang nods his head.Other than some exceptionally popular teacher that most students set their eyes on, when most teachers choose their own students, their students are allowed to examine the capabilities of the teachers as well.After thinking it through, Zheng Yang immediately retrieves the spear from his back and fixes the multiple parts together.Weng!With the long spear in his hands, Zheng Yang's expression changes instantly, just like the intimidating glint of the sharp edge of an unsheathed blade.Sou sou sou sou!The long spear stabs forward and a sonic waves boom. The entire room sounds as though it is being torn apart and a strong gust of wind whips up in the surroundings.Experts are identifiable the moment they make a move. This Zheng Yang, although he may not be considered too strong, but his prowess with the spear is indeed quite not bad.Hu!The tip of his spear tremors and strikes the rock pillar not too far away. A light reverberation lingers in the air and numbers appear on the pillar.\"110!\"To think it would be more than a hundred kilograms!Just by the destructive prowess itself, even a 1-dan Fighter Juxi realm pinnacle would be unable to take the blow!\"Teacher, please offer me some pointers!\"With his spear held vertically beside him, Zheng Yang stands upright without a hint of nervousness or tiredness as he looks at Zhang Xuan impassively.Truthfully, just by the size of the classroom, he doesn't hold high expectations for this teacher. He thinks that his standard would at most be of average.As though proving his point, the teacher before him squints his eye. It is difficult to fathom what he might be thinking. He only slowly opens his eyes after hearing his words. He turns to look at him with a faint hint of a smile on his lips.\"You are emotionally wounded? That is... you have been dumped before?After thinking it through, Zheng Yang immediately retrieves the spear from his back and fixes the multiple parts together.TL: In case you find this part weird, it is probably like 3 parts to the spear (a spear is quite long. It tends to be taller than a human, so it is hard to carry around)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8: I Am That TrashTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Un?\"Zheng Yang stares blankly before his face turns red and darkens.\"I once had a crush on a girl. Then... I was humiliated by her. But this has nothing to do with teacher!\"He once had a crush on a girl and he had once confessed to her excitedly. However, he was humiliated heartlessly by the other party and he felt ashamed of it. He has kept this incident a secret such that not even Mo Xiao is aware of it. How did this teacher know of this?\"Is that for real? Zheng Yang, why didn't you tell me that you got humiliated by someone? Who is it?\" Hearing him admit to it, Mo Xiao is surprised and hurriedly asks him.\"I will tell you about it later!\" Zheng Yang shakes his head, refusing to say any more about it here. He looks at the teacher before him and says, \"Teacher, this is my private affair. I have no idea how you could have knew this, but this should have nothing to do with guiding me in the way of the spear!\"\"Nothing to do with it?\" Zhang Xuan shakes his head. \"This has everything to do with it!\"\"Everything to do with it?\" Zheng Yang is a little doubtful of his words.What does a broken heart have to do with the Zhang Xuan guiding him?\"Your spear is decisive and powerful. This is just like your personality. No matter what you do, you always charge straight ahead without thinking about the consequences! This should have been a good thing. Warriors should be like that, charging ahead without concerning themselves with minor things!\" Zhang Xuan looks at Zheng Yang calmly. \"However, it is a pity that after your emotional experience, fear started to sprout within you. You fear rejection and you fear humiliation! There is hesitation in your spear. With that additional hesitation, your strength greatly reduces!\"\"You.... You... You could see all these from my spear? You could tell that I was once heartbroken? You could tell my personality?\"Zheng Yang is shocked.The words of the other party aren't wrong. Rather, they are too correct, there isn't even a single error in it.His personality is straightforward and in this past, this allows him to charge ahead bravely without fear. Yet, due to that emotional experience, he starts to become timid and hesitant in everything he does.For him to be capable of telling all these through his spear, even his heartbreak, what kind of eyes do he possess?When did such an impressive teacher appear in the academy?He feels as though he is going crazy.Previously, when he visited the number 1 spear teacher Wang Chao to request for him to accept him as a student, Wang Chao only told him that he has yet to grasp the crux of the way of the spear. As for the reason behind it, he couldn't really tell. However, with just a single look, the man before him could tell that he had a history of heartbreak and that his skills stagnated due to the emotional trauma from it. Could this teacher's ability to discern... be stronger to Wang Chao?\"This is normal!\" Zhang Xuan gestures with his hand, a look of an expert appearing on his face. \"The spear is a reflection of one's heart. If one's heart isn't clear, the skills they display through it would be dark! Even though your skills with the spear is coherent, it feels as though there is something shrouding it, something that you are unable to make sense of, something that you are unable to sever from you. With just one look, I can tell that it is definitely a crush!\"\"This...\"This time, not only does Zheng Yang's face crumbles, even the mouth of Mo Xiao beside him is opens so wide that an egg could soon be stuffed inside it.What the heck, are you for real?Just by looking at one's skill with the spears, you could tell that emotions are shrouding it, and the unable to make sense of and unable to sever... Are these still the eyes of a human?Mo Xiao and Zheng Yang stares at one another, disbelief appearing in both of their eyes.\"Teacher, can you help me take a look as well?\"After the shock, Mo Xiao steps forward with a look of desire on his face. Regardless of whether Zhang Xuan is agreeable or not, the spear in his hands tremble and he begins to execute his moves.He executes the same moves as Zheng Yang, just that they are stronger and much more fluid.Just by his skills with the spears itself, he is indeed better than Zheng Yang. It is no wonder that Wang Chao laoshi chose him and not Zheng Yang.Hu!After a gust of wind, Mo Xiao retracts his spear and stands up straight.When his spear moves, he is like an unparalleled frenzied demon. When his strength overflows, even gods and spirits dare not approach. When his spear retracts, he stands quietly just like a statue.With a movement of his hands and feet, his disposition changes.Although he cannot be considered to be strong, being at Fighter One-dan, he could be considered to have walked quite a distance in the way of the spear.\"You have a weak stomach. If I am not wrong, you even suffered diarrhea today!\"Zhang Xuan's serene gaze turns towards him.\"Ah?\" A shudder passes through Mo Xiao. \"Teacher, you could tell that I had diarrhea from my spear?\"Just like what the other party said, his stomach isn't doing well today. He already started having diarrhea from yesterday. Today, it got even worse and his body feels weak.However, this doesn't really affect him much. With a spear in his hand, he still managed to execute his skills at top form such that even Wang Chao laoshi couldn't stop praising him. Yet, the man before him could see through it in an instant...Is that for real?To be able to tell one's heartbreak and diarrhea just from his spear, what are his eyes made of?\"You want me to guide you? If you want, then acknowledge me as your master!\"Ignoring the shock of the two, Zhang Xuan looks at them calmly.To be able to tell the condition of them both so simply, the both of them are about to go mad from shock. Yet, it doesn't seem like anything much to him.The truth is the same as well. When the both of them executed their skills, the Library of Heaven's Path automatically compiled a book on them both and the heartbreak and diarrhea naturally appeared in the list of their flaws. Zhang Xuan only has to take a look and read them out loud. There isn't any difficulty to it at all.\"Disciple Zheng Yang is willing to acknowledge teacher as my mentor!\"Without any hesitation, Zheng Yang immediately kneels on my floor.He is truly impressed by Zhang Xuan.With this kind of eye for discernment, how could his guidance be ordinary?\"Un!\" Seeing how Zheng Yang acknowledges him as his master just after he pointed out a flaw of his, even before he started guiding him, Zhang Xuan nods his head satisfactorily. He retrieves a jade token representing his new identity to him and says, \"Verify our relationship!\"\"Yes!\" Without any delay, Zheng Yang immediately drips a blood on it to verify his ownership of the token.Very quickly, the procedures are completed.\"Since you are now my student, let me give you a suggestion. If you want to be respected in a relationship, you must first hold sufficient strength. Without strength, how could the other party think of you as an equal? Thus, the first thing you have to do is not to be depressed but to open up your mind and focus on your training. You must let the other party know how foolish they were to reject you! You must use your strength to prove to them...\" At this point, Zhang Xuan suddenly recalls a very show off book from his previous life and smiles faintly, \"The river reverses its flow after thirty years, do not bully the youths just because they are poor!\"\"Do not bully the youths just because they are poor?\"Hearing those words, Zheng Yang feels a burning sensation in his chest. He feels so agitated that his face turns entirely red and his body trembles uncontrollably.As a person born in this world, how could Zheng Yang possibly have heard of those words!In that instant, his battle will seem to have been lit.The depressed emotions he welled up from his heartbreak seems to shine brightly like diamonds.\"Try executing your skills again!\"Seeing how he has broken out of his shell, Zhang Xuan gestures.\"Alright!\"Without saying anything, with the spear in his hands, Zheng Yang's disposition changes in an instant. It is completely different from his disposition previously.Hong hong hong hong!His spear sweeps about as his aura rumbles. Powerful strength is exerted through the spear and scatters into the surrounding, shaking the entire room.Peng!At the end of his spear routine, he sends a horizontal stab towards the rock pillar.A deafening reverberation and a line of digits appear on it.235!To think it would be 235kg!Previously, when he used his full strength, it was only 110. With just a pointer, his strength increased by more than a single fold!\"Thank you, teacher!\"Seeing the numbers, the doubts in Zheng Yang vanished. He kneels onto the floor. At this moment, he is truly convinced in the capabilities of the teacher before him.\"Incredible!\"Looking at the numbers on the rock pillar, Mo Xiao couldn't help but turn red as his entire body trembles.He is delighted over finding a good teacher for his good brother. Yet, he feels disappointed at the same time.Previously, when Wang Chao guided him, his strength only increased by 30%.Yet, the teacher before him enhanced Zheng Yang's strength by more than a fold!If only he had known that this nameless teacher is that formidable, he wouldn't have wasted his effort to look for Wang Chao and would have immediately acknowledged him as his teacher.At this moment, he feels a little regretful.However, doubt sprouts in his mind. How could such a formidable spear teacher remain unknown?He can't resist asking, \"Teacher, since you have accepted Zheng Yang as your student, could we have the honor of knowing your name...\"Hearing his words, Zheng Yang looks over as well.He is completely impressed by this teacher, but at this moment, he realises that he doesn't even know his name!\"I am Zhang Xuan!\" Zhang Xuan replies calmly.\"Zhang Xuan? That name sounds familiar...\"Hearing that name, Mo Xiao ponders for a moment. Then, something comes to mind and his eyes narrow. His lips quiver uncontrollably as he asks, \"I seem to recall... The trash teacher who scored zero points for his Teacher Qualification Examination is also called Zhang Xuan. It seems that teacher, you... have the same name as him!\"\"Un, I am that trash!\"Zhang Xuan nods his head.\"Ah...\"Zheng Yang and Mo Xiao petrify.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9: BetTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexThere are many rumors regarding that useless teacher. Before even coming to the academy, they have heard so much about him that callouses were growing on their ears.They say that he is skilled in nothing and that he had been misguiding disciples!They say that he doesn't know how to cultivate and he doesn't know martial arts at all...All in all, all kinds of slander there is!As long as one is a student, it is best to stay as far away as possible from him. Do not mess with this fellow, otherwise going berserk is just a small matter at hand. At worse, they may even die in his hands!When both brothers came to the academy to seek a teacher, they have also heard of such rumors. All along, they have been proceeding carefully but never in their dreams would they imagine that this unworldly and incredible expert is that legendary trash!\"Teacher, if you are so incredible, why would...\"Zheng Yang couldn't resist asking.Although it has just been a short period of time since they knew each other, he could tell that the teacher before him had immeasurable capabilities. Every single movement of his has an elegant disposition. How could he be a trash?\"There are many people in the world who are envious of the talented. This kind of things means nothing at all!\"Zhang Xuan tilts his eyes upwards 45 degrees as sadness and regret reflect in his eyes, as though lamenting the incomprehension of the world.The emotions on his face are in place, but in his heart, he is scolding vulgarities.If it wasn't for the Library of Heaven's Path, given how the previous owner of the body was, it was already very incredible of him to not get a negative score. Zero marks... is already a high score, alright!\"I am willing to cleanse teacher of his sullied reputation!\"Seeing his teacher's 'depression' and 'incomprehension of the world', Zheng Yang's heart is moved and he couldn't help but declare so.\"It's okay, teacher's reputation doesn't matter. As long as you train hard, I would be satisfied. Take the identity token to claim your bedding. Come to class punctually tomorrow, make sure to not be late!\"After Zhang Xuan's show of acting cool, he seems to have fully captured the worship of the student. Zheng Yang nods his head.\"Yes!\"Zheng Yang pulls Mo Xiao, who is standing beside him, and the both of them walks out.\"Four students!\"Seeing the two of them leave, excitement flashes across Zhang Xuan's eyes.The dazed young lady Wang Ying, the student who he won from a bet Liu Yang, the arrogant young mistress Zhao Ya and the spear genius Zheng Yang.Initially, he thought that today would be just like how it was before, he would be unable to recruit a single student and the day would end in a failure. He didn't expect that he would manage to recruit four of them!\"Without identity token, even if students were to come, I would be unable to admit new students. I better make use of this free time to get a few more tokens!\"After getting emotional over recruiting four students does Zhang Xuan realize that he doesn't have any more tokens on him.This item is given out by the academy. Due to his terrible reputation, the teacher in charge of distributing the tokens only gave him four. He even thought that Zhang Xuan would be unable to use all of it. If he doesn't claim more of it, even if new students were to come, they would be unable to acknowledge him!This token contains the information of the teacher. Once a student claims ownership of the token by dripping a blood drop on it, it means that they acknowledge the teacher as their mentor. On the other hand, if they would like to withdraw from the lesson, the teacher only has drip a blood drop on it and the information of the student would be erased.Standing up, he walks out of the classroom.The sun outside shines brightly and a heat wave assaults through the shade of the tree, causing people to sweat profusely.Freshmen and older students are walking on the pavements of the academy and excitement could be seen on their faces.Coming into a new environment and acknowledging a teacher, the freshmen are overjoyed. On the other hand, upon thinking of the arrival of new students for them to play with, the older students are full of smiles as well.While walking along the pavement, a large infrastructure appears before Zhang Xuan. There are two giant words hanging on a board in the center of the building 'Logistics Building!\"The tokens that represent the identity of a teacher are claimed from this building.\"Yo, who is this? Isn't this our 'star teacher'? For you to not be recruiting students in the classroom to visit me, what do you want? Oh, let me guess, could it be that you used none of the identity tokens, so you are here to return them!\"Right after walking in, he hears a sarcastic voice sounding out.Zhang Xuan raises his head and a plump man whose face is full of fats comes into view.This fellow at least weighs 300 to 400 kilogram. From afar, he looks like a giant ball of meat.\"Qian Biao!\" A name floats from the depths of his memories.This Qian Biao is one of the teachers in charge of logistics. He is a very spiteful man who always likes to eat into the spare change of others. As the teacher on the lowest level, Zhang Xuan's salary has been minute and the resources he could claim had always been minimal. Thus, he has never been respected by him.Due to this affair, he offended him. The moment they meet, all kinds of sarcasm and insults would come flying out.Previously, Zhang Xuan been given four identity tokens under the premise that he wouldn't finish it is the work of this man.\"I have finished using my identity tokens. I would like to claim a few more of them!\" Can't be bothered with the other party, Zhang Xuan speaks calmly.\"Finished using it?\" Qian Biao stuns for a moment before howling in laughter. \"Haha, everyone, come and take a look. This teacher who is first from the bottom comes here to brag that he has used up all of his identity tokens! Haha, this is the funniest joke I have heard in the entire world...\"\"I seem to recall that you gave him four identity tokens back then! Finished it? Him? What a joke!\"\"The teacher who is second from the bottom, Sun Yan laoshi is said to only have one student currently. This fellow who made history by scoring zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination could accept a single student? What are you trying to brag about?\"\"Throw him out. Anyway, after today, he would be fired...\"......Upon hearing Qian Biao's shouting, the few teachers in the logistics branch came rushing over. They stared at Zhang Xuan with looks of disdain.For a teacher who is at the very bottom and scored zero for the Teacher Qualification Examination, why the hell is he trying to show off?Students would run the instant the hear your name. For them to acknowledge you... what kind of joke is this?\"Oh? You said that I am bragging? Fine, why don't we bet on it?\" Zhang Xuan doesn't get mad. Instead, he smiles.\"Bet? Fine, since you want to lose so badly, I will fulfill your wish. Just that, given how poor you are, I doubt that there is anything you could offer!\" Qian Biao didn't expect this fellow who he had always looked down on would challenge his authority face on by betting with him. He snickers in disdain.\"It isn't your problem whether I am poor or not. Since I proposed the bet, of course, I will take out something I am willing to bet on!\" Zhang Xuan widens his eyes.\"Oh? You are able to take something out? Given your background, the things you take out would probably just be some rotten metal or similar shit-like things. You think that grandfather I would bet with you? I can't afford to lose my reputation betting with you!\" Qian Biao states contemptuously.Zhang Xuan is the lowest level teacher in the entire academy, not to mention first from the back. Not mentioning the fact how he is unable to get a single student, he doesn't even have bonuses or so. If one must point out the poorest teacher in the entire academy, it would definitely be him.He lives thriftily even in his daily life, not to mention resources for cultivation!\"Hehe!\" Zhang Xuan isn't bothered by his insults at all. He chuckles and continues, \"The thing I would like to bet isn't a treasure or an object. It is... face! If you were to lose, I will slap you three times in front of everyone else! If I were to lose, I will let you slap me three times! Do you dare to bet with me?\"\"Slapping face?\"He didn't expect the other party would bet on this. Qian Biao couldn't help but to hesitate over it.To be slapped by the academy's worst teacher, if he were to lose, he wouldn't even feel like living on. He would be so embarrassed that he would want to die.\"How, do you dare or not?\" Zhang Xuan smiles at him.\"Qian Biao, what are you scared of? It's not like you don't know his standards!\"\"Can a teacher who scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination get a single student? Isn't he just dreaming!\"\"He is just scaring you. If he is able to recruit them, then won't I have a few hundreds of students by now? Even if the students of this year were to be blind, they wouldn't be blind to such an extent!\"......The other teachers of the logistics branch smirk.None of them believe that Zhang Xuan would be able to recruit students.This is as difficult as a pig climbing up a tree.\"Fine, I agree!\" Finding everyone's words logical, he nods his head in agreement.\"Since the rest of you are cheering so happily, would you all like to make a bet along with me? With the same terms as him?\"Seeing him agree, Zhang Xuan looks towards the other three teachers of the logistics branch.The previous three who were so disparaging a moment ago didn't mind adding to the bet since one of them had already agreed to it.\"Why? Do you find your face itchy that you would like us to slap a few more times? Fine, I'm in!\" A teacher declares haughtily.\"I'm also in!\"\"Who's afraid of you! To be bragging in front of us despite scoring a zero, you are looking for death!\"The three of them nod their head with a smirk on their face.In their opinion, Zhang Xuan is bound to lose this bet. Today, he would definitely be slapped!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10: Going Against the BetTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Alright, since you said that you accepted four students, bring them here now so that can we verify your claim. Or, you do want to just present your face now for us to slap?\"Looking at the teacher who is first from the bottom arrogantly betting with the four of them, Qian Biao smirks coldly.\"Bring the students here?\" Zhang Xuan shakes his head. \"You are all teachers of the logistics branch, it can't be that you don't even know the simplest thing! It is easy to verify whether I recruited four students or not. As long as students were to claim ownership of my token, their personal information will automatically appear in the Education Bureau. As long as we verify it with the Education Bureau, the truth would be clear for all to see. After all, the Education Bureau can't possibly be working with me just to lie to you all!\"As long as a student had verified his relationship with a teacher, the information would be automatically transmitted to the Education Bureau and recorded. No one would be able to fake the results!\"Li Yuan, you take a look! I want to see how this fellow could still act so smug after that!\"After looking at his confident expression and hearing his words, Qian Biao is taken aback for a moment before turning around to command Li Yuan.Li Yuan is one of the teachers who mocked Zhang Xuan previously. Hearing the orders, he turns around and walks out of the Logistics Branch.The Education Bureau and Logistics Branch belong under the Administration Branch. It didn't take long for Li Yuan to return with a darkened face.\"How was it?\"Looking at the expression on his face, Qian Biao's heart pounds furiously, 'ge dong!', as an ominous premonition looms in his head.\"There is... four students who acknowledged him as their teachers! These are their names are personal information...\"Li Yuan face turns strikingly pale.Even now, he still finds the fact hard to believe.Are those four students blind? Of the many teachers in Hongtian Academy, why did they have to choose a teacher who scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination, a fellow who doesn't know anything!\"Let me look at it! Let's make sure that he didn't find some disabled and blind fellows who could be expelled at any time to be his students!\"Qian Biao grabs the name list.The other two teachers hurriedly surround him.There are quite a few teachers who would recruit some inadequate students so as the boost the number of students they have. These people could be expelled at any time. Even if they were kept in the academy at the moment, they probably wouldn't last more than a few months!In Qian Biao's opinion, for a person like Zhang Xuan who ranks at the very bottom, even if he successfully manages to recruit students, he could only recruit the worst of the lot, students whom no one wants.Accepting this kind of students just to fill the numbers doesn't bring the teacher any pride, it brings shame instead!\"Wang Ying... a female? She doesn't sound like anything by her name. She is probably one of the students who scored the worst in the entrance examination...\" Looking at the first name on the name list, Qian Biao snorts in disdain.Hongtian Academy is not a place anyone can enter. If one wishes to enroll, they would first have to undergo the entrance examination. Then, the students would be ranked based on their results and those who meets the prerequisites would be accepted.Those who scored the first few in the entrance examination are hot targets for the more outstanding teachers. Each of them is famous in this academy and among them, there doesn't seem to be a student called Wang Ying.\"Qian laoshi, continue looking on...\" Before Qian Biao could finish his words, he hears the trembling voice of one of the teachers beside him.\"Why? Could she be worse than I have described?\"With a cold laugh, Qian Biao continues browsing down the list. With just one look, his eyes narrow as he reads the detailed information on Wang Ying below her name. \"Rank 67 of the entrance examination, younger sister of Wang Tao, an Elder's disciple, and the young mistress of one of the four great families in Tianxuan City!\"\"The young mistress of the Wang family? Wang Tao's younger sister?\" Qian Biao gasps in astonishment.There are four great families in Tianxuan Kingdom and the Wang family is one of it. The young mistress of such an esteemed family acknowledges the fellow who got a zero for his Teacher Qualification Examination as her teacher? Are you for real?Shouldn't a figure like that go for Lu Xun or Wang Chao?If her family were the ones who induces fear in him, then what that causes him to fall into despair is Wang Ying's elder brother, Wang Tao!\"He was enrolled in the academy two batches prior and after his enrollment, he has always scored within the top ten in the annual comprehensive evaluation. This year, an elder in the academy even sets his eyes upon him and accepted him in as his disciple!If the older brother has that kind of talent, how bad could the younger sister be?Having an influential background, talent and a good brother, she still chose to acknowledge this fellow as her teacher?My eyes must be going blind for it to make such a mistake!Qian Biao could hear lightning rumbling around him and he feels on the verge of fainting.\"Look at the ones below...\"Just as he is convulsing in disbelief, another teacher exclaims with a shaky voice.\"He probably used up all of his luck to be able to admit a Wang Ying in. I don't believe that he would be capable of getting someone even more incredible...\" Clenching his teeth, Qian Biao continues glancing down the list. When his eyes gaze on that name, his entire body convulses yet again and he feels the sight before him turning dark.\"Zhao Ya? The Zhao Ya who is 7th in the entrance examination? The daughter of the City Lord of Baiyu City?\"Qian Biao feels like tears are going to stream down from his eyes at any point.He just said that he wouldn't believe that Zhang Xuan would be able to recruit an even more incredible student and never in his dreams would imagine that he was able to... Not only so, it is a popular student whom countless teachers would go crazy for!He has already heard of this Zhao Ya before she even enrolled in this academy. She is the daughter of the City Lord of Baiyu City and not only is she pretty, she is also blessed with great talents.This kind of talent would be competed over by the teachers who rank at the top. Why would she acknowledge such a trash?Impossible, this is impossible!He tries to forcibly suppress his emotions. Glancing downwards, he sees the names, Liu Yang and Zheng Yang. The two may not be very famous, but their rankings are not low in the entrance examinations, scoring within the front hundred!Especially, Zheng Yang. It is said that he specializes in the spear. Due to the limitations of the examination, he wasn't able to exert his full strength, causing his ranking to fall behind. If he were to be allowed to use his spear, he might be even able to get into the top twenty!Staring at the names of the four on the list over and over again, Qian Biao and the other teachers feel like they are going mad.This isn't rational!\"You must have used some kind of deception to get them to acknowledge you. Even though they acknowledged you as their teacher, they don't know who you are. The moment they find out, they would withdraw from your lessons...\"Suddenly, Qian Biao howls with a savage expression.What rights does a teacher who scored zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination have to recruit such outstanding students! He must have used some kind of despicable method which no one knew of. The moment these methods are revealed, these students would abandon him in anger!That is to say, while it is true he has four students, these students probably won't follow him for long. They will withdraw from his lessons in a matter of time.\"It isn't your problem whether they withdraw from my lessons or not. The bet that we decided on was whether I have students now. Now that you all have verified that I have four students, shouldn't we be fulfilling the conditions of our bet?\"Cannot be bothered with the savage-looking quartet whose minds are around the place, Zhang Xuan speaks calmly.Qian Biao, Li Yuan and the other two have expressions on their face that look as though they are in a funeral.The content of their bets was indeed on whether he had students now, and not what would happen in the future.Going by such, they have lost!However, they are unable to accept the fact that they have lost and that they would be slapped by the worst teacher in the academy!\"Bet? Little fellow, what if we refuse?\"After a slight hesitation, Qian Biao smirks coldly and a ferocious look appears on his plump face.\"Indeed, even if we go against our words, what can you do? Haha, do you want to beat us up? The fact is, do you have the ability to?\"\"The worst teacher in the academy with the worst cultivation. To be so smug in front of us, do you believe that even if we were to beat you up to the point that your head swells up like a pig head, no one would come to stop us?\"\"Stop acting cool and perhaps you could stay in the academy a little longer. Otherwise, it wouldn't take long for you to be kicked out and be shamed!\"Li Yuan and the others immediately understood Qian Biao's intentions and sneers.Not only did Zhang Xuan fare the worst in the Teacher Qualification Examination, his cultivation is also subpar among all of the teachers. Even if he isn't the very worst, he isn't far from it!That's precisely the reason why he doesn't have the eye to discern the problems in the training of his students.Naturally, Qian Biao and the rest wouldn't be willing to be slapped. Since the other party doesn't possess the strength to enforce the agreement, they intend to go against their words to the end.\"Oh? That is to say, you all don't intend to follow the rules of the bet?\"Zhang Xuan isn't angry. Instead, he smiles at them.\"That's right! You brat, what do you think you are? To think that you would think of slapping me, do you believe that I will slap you to your death right now?\"Seeing how this fellow doesn't back out and continues acting so smugly, Li Yuan is provoked and immediately sends a slap towards him.Even before the slap reaches, the pressure from the wind causes one to experience shortness of breath.Although this Li Yuan is only a teacher of the Logistics Branch, his cultivation isn't low. He has already reached the level of a Fighter 4-dan Advanced.There are 9 dans to a Fighter, 1-dan Juxi, 2-dan Dantian, 3-dan Zhenqi, 4-dan Pigu, 5-dan Dingli, 6-dan Pixue, 7-dan Tongxuan, 8-dan Zongshi, 9-dan Zhizun.Another new world appears with every level. The higher you climb, the harder it is for you to progress.In every level, there are four tiers, primary, intermediate, advanced and pinnacle.Zhang Xuan is the youngest teacher in the entire academy, being just 19 this year. His cultivation is only at 3-dan Zhenqi Pinnacle!Li Yuan is a level higher than him!The difference between each level is very great and is almost cannot be overcome.Pah!Just when everyone thought that Li Yuan would definitely strike on Zhang Xuan's face, leaving him faint-headed, a sudden crisp sound echo. Everyone immediately sees a red mark on Li Yuan's face as fresh blood spurts out of him and a large bunch of his teeth fall to the floor.\"How... How is this possible?\"Everyone stands in their spot dumbfounded and on the verge of going insane.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone found the sight unbelievable.Besides, wasn't this fellow the last in the sparring during the Teacher Qualification Examination? Why... is he so strong now?\"It must just be a coincidence, do not fear him!\"Qian Biao howls.One of the teachers also agrees with what Qian Biao says and charges over.Just like Li Yuan, he has reached Pigu realm advanced stage. His muscles are just like metal tendons and his skin is just like a metal plate, giving an impression of indestructibility.\"You shall fall to the ground!\"Stepping forward, this teacher lifts his eyebrow and prepares to smack him with his palm.Pah pah!The compression of the air results in explosive sonic booms.Facing the other party's ruthless blows, Zhang Xuan remains calm. With his forefinger and middle finger together, he strikes upwards at a slanted angle.Pada!The teacher whose body is like a metal plate feels a slight pain at his armpits before his vision went dark and he collapses onto the floor.\"What?\"In two strikes, two Fighter 4-dan teachers were defeated. The remaining two teachers, including Qian Biao, knows that the teacher whom they had been looking down upon isn't as simple as they thought to be!\"Let's attack together...\"With a loud roar, Qian Biao raises his fist and charges over. However, even before he made a move, Zhang Xuan suddenly appears right before him. His left-hand grabs his face while his right-hand pokes him lightly.Putong!A pain in the abdomen and Qian Biao collapses to the floor as well.The moment his body hits the floor, the last teacher whom he teamed up with also falls to the ground and convulses as though he is epileptic.\"You... How did you know all of our mingmen...\"With a spurt of fresh blood, Qian Biao stares at the fellow in front of him in fright.He finally understands why even though the other party's strength is far from them, the results ended in the direct opposite.Their opponent found the mingmen of their cultivation the moment he strikes, how could they have possibly expected this and guard against it?All cultivators would tend to have a mingmen as their weakness and the moment it is struck, even if the person striking is a child, it would be possible to kill the person!However, mingmen is the core of a human, thus cultivators would protect it carefully. Even the closest kin would not know where their mingmen is. Although Zhang Xuan does not possess strong cultivation, he seems to know where their mingmen is and strikes at their vitals directly.How could they resist against someone like that?Hearing his words of astonishment, Zhang Xuan smiles without explaining.Of course, it is through the Library of Heaven's Path.Not only does the Library of Heaven's Path allows him to see through flaws in one's cultivation techniques, he is also able to see the personal problems of the cultivator and his mingmen. They are all written in detail on it.Knowing his opponents mingmen and the weaknesses in their skills, even if Zhang Xuan transcended from Earth and still isn't very familiar with the skills of this foreign world, it is still a simple task to subdue the four of them.\"Since you all chose to accept the bet, you all should have prepared yourself for the consequences of losing the bet. If you all had obediently allowed me to slap you all, we wouldn't have to go through so much trouble!\" Zhang Xuan chuckles.\"Zhang Xuan, you don't need to get gleeful over it! I don't know what kind of despicable methods you used to find out where our mingmen is to wound me, but as the least experienced teacher, you attacked other teachers in public! Just by this alone, I am able to send a complaint letter to the academy to have your Teacher Qualification revoked...\"Qian Biao howls.There are clear levels between teachers in the academy. For lower level teachers to make a move against higher level teachers is an immoral action.Zhang Xuan is young, and he also scored zero for his Teacher Qualification Examination. Thus, he is considered as one of the least qualified teacher in the academy. For him to wound four people who are more qualified than him, if the academy were to be informed of this incident, there would definitely be an uproar. His Teacher Qualification License being revoked is a small matter, it might be possible for him to be directly expelled!\"Why? Since you can't defeat me using martial arts, you want to try to the rules to suppress me?\" Despite facing such threats, Zhang Xuan doesn't seem to be bothered by it.\"Indeed!\" Li Yuan is also thinking about this. Excitement and cruelty flash across his eyes, \"If you obediently kneel before us now and allow us to beat you up, perhaps when our moods lift, we won't report the incident. Otherwise, prepare to be fired!\"\"After being fired from your position, without your identity as a teacher protecting you, no one will say anything even if you are killed!\" Another teacher howls.In Tianxuan Kingdom, the teachers of an academy are of high social status. The moment they lose their job, their social status would also fall correspondingly. If so, the few of them would really dare to make a move to kill him.\"Since you all want to deal with this using rules, alright, I will also deal with this using rules then!\" With a tranquil gaze, he walks a few step to Qian Biao and says, \"Qian Biao laoshi, you secretly used Elder Chen Ming's treasure to please your concubine; three months ago, you embezzled from the school's fund to buy a house for her; a month ago, when you broke Elder Liu Quan's most beloved porcelain, you pushed the blame onto a student, causing him to be expelled... Do I need to be recounting all of these matters in front of the school leaders?\"\"You... you...\"Qian Biao's eyes narrow as his plump body twitches uncontrollably. An inconceivable fear surges through his entire body. He looks as though he has seen a ghost and is on the verge of going insane.He committed all of those without leaving behind any traces, so no one knew about it. Even his colleagues, Li Yuan and the others, aren't aware, so this fellow... how did he know about it? Furthermore, with such details?\"Li Yuan laoshi, did the female student, whom you robbed of her dignity that resulted in her suicide from three years ago, return as a vengeful spirit to look for you? A few days ago, you grew an acne on your back. Perhaps, this could be her seeking you for revenge!\"Ignoring Qian Biao's terrified expression, Zhang Xuan turns to look at Li Yuan.\"Ah...\"Hearing those words, Li Yuan hurriedly backs away from fright as his face drains of all color.Three years ago, he was enchanted by a beautiful female student and he humiliated her, causing her to commit suicide from the shame. This incident was very covert and except for him, no one knew about it. Due to his conscience acting up against him, throughout the three years, he often dreamt of the other party coming to reap his life as a vengeful spirit. Furthermore, half a month ago, a giant acne in the shape of a human palm grew on his back, scaring him out of his wits.After hearing Zhang Xuan recount this event with great details, his entire body trembles uncontrollably out of overwhelming fear.Putong!His knees lost his strength and he kneels onto the floor. A sudden pungent smell wafts around the room. To think a Fighter 4-dan advanced stage expert would be frightened to the point of peeing out in public.\"Du Chun laoshi, you stole your good brother's business and even poisoned him to death through toxic wine. Although this incident was inconclusive back then, if rumors were to spread out now, do you think that you can continue being a teacher?\"\"Bai Lin laoshi, there isn't any major flaws in your actions. However, due to your interest in antiques, you have accepted many gifts from the students! If I'm not wrong, the ancient jade ring which you wear should be a gift from back then when a student had something to request of you. As for what the request is about and who the student is, do you still need me to go into details?\"Looking at the two remaining teachers, Zhang Xuan states.\"You... You are a devil!\"\"You aren't human...\"The remaining two teachers are also all frightened out of their wits. This time, their stares are full of fear.Those things that they have done, although it might not be impeccable, they were confident that no outsider would know of it. Yet, how could this fellow be so aware of it, it is as though he is a specter!When he defeated them through his skills, they only felt ashamed, but not fear. However, when he revealed all of their secrets, they were truly terrified! It is as though the multiple clothes on them were instantly ripped to shreds, causing them to stand nude in front of everyone else.They can already imagine that when the information leaks out, whether they could remain as teachers is already a small affair. In the worst case scenario, they might be sent to the Teacher Court and be killed on the spot!\"We were wrong!\"\"Zhang Xuan laoshi, as a great man, don't bear grudges against minor figures like us. Please spare us...\"......Trembling, they unwillingly beg for mercy.\"I am lazy to bother with what you all did in the past, just stop pissing me off in the future! Also, if you all don't change and continue committing more vile actions, I won't mind interfering to ensure that you all would receive punishments proportionate to your crime!\"Zhang Xuan waves his hand in disdain.Actually, if these people didn't get on his nerves, he wouldn't be bothered with them.The Library of Heaven's Path is able to peer into all of one's flaws. Even personality and past actions are counted in its midst, not to mention that this is only a small portion of the entire book.However, he isn't the savior of the world, so no matter what they did in the past and do in the future, as long as they do not cross his path, he wouldn't be concerned with them!What these people should have never done is to find trouble with him and make things difficult for him!Since you made things difficult for me, I will show you what death looks like!So that, you would never dare to think of doing the same the second time!\"We don't dare, we will never dare to...\"\"Zhang Xuan laoshi, these are the identity tokens that you wanted. Take as much as you want to...\"......Hearing that he would not expose their past actions, Qian Biao and the rest heaves a sigh of relief.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12: Emperor BloodlineTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexAn hour later, Zhang Xuan walks out from the Logistics Branch and his eyes twinkle in excitement.If it had been his previous self, he would have ended up being taken advantage of today. However, with the Library of Heaven's Path, his life took a complete turn towards another direction.\u201cPerhaps, it is a blessing for me to transcend over! This kind of exciting life is what I hope for!\u201dZhang Xuan clenches his fist and exhales a breath of air.In his previous life, he was only a librarian living a plain and simple life that only rotates around the library and his home. Even if he were to continue on like that, he would only continue claiming his salary and continue with his aimless life. However, things are different here. With a great gift package known as the Library of Heaven's Path, perhaps he would be able to walk further and become stronger. He would be able to live an entirely new and exciting life!At this moment, Zhang Xuan has finally become a part of the world! He no longer struggles in his heart over the dilemma between his homeland and this world.\u201cDon't pull me. Let me die, I want to die\u2026\u201dJust when he is secretly celebrating, he hears a piercing wail from a distance not too far away. It sounds like a frenzied bull, causing one's heart to tear in agony.Turning around, he sees a fatty howling that he would charge towards the manmade lake in the academy and commit suicide by jumping into it.Behind the fatty, no one tries to stop him. The fatty himself also doesn't charge forward despite howling non-stop. Suddenly, he turns around and grabs the palm of a student beside him and puts it on himself, making it seem as though the student is pulling him back. Then, he continues howling.\u201cDon't pull me, let me die. I don't want to live anymore\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone is speechless.\u201cThat's too shameless!\u201d Zhang Xuan shakes his head.This fatty, despite not wanting to die, insists on portraying a fake image of someone restraining himself from committing suicide. He is really shameless.Knowing that this fellow can't possibly die, he can't be bothered with him anymore. Instead, he walks towards his own classroom. Before he could walk far, the howling voice seems to close in on him as the ground tremors. Following which, a pair of thick arms hugs his leg.\u201cTeacher, I'm begging you, please accept me as your disciple. They all scorn me because of my size and reject me\u2026\u201dThe fatty bursts into tears.\u201cLet go!\u201dZhang Xuan is speechless.Isn't this fellow too eccentric? Rushing over to beg him to accept him as his disciple upon seeing that he is a teacher, Zhang Xuan has never seen such a person in his life.\u201cTeacher, I will only let go if you accept me!\u201d Tears and snot flow freely from the multiple faucets of the fatty. His voice sounds so sorrowful that even those who are watching from the side start to sympathize with him. \u201cToday, I have already visited over ten teachers but none of them were willing to accept me. This teacher over here, seeing how pitiful I am, please accept me!\u201dThe examinations among the students would also affect a teacher's evaluation. A plump person like him would tend to have trouble in his battles and his agility. Most renowned teachers would be unwilling to accept him.\u201cIf you want me to accept you, you would have to at least show me your abilities. What do you expect to achieve by hugging my leg?\u201d Zhang Xuan says.He possesses the Library of Heaven's Path so he should have no trouble recruiting students. If this person turns out to be mediocre, Zhang Xuan would not accept him as his disciple.\u201cTeacher, you have to accept me as your disciple. I am quite capable\u2026\u201d The fatty looks up hesitantly before slowly loosening his arms.\u201cWe have to see before we know whether you are capable or not. There is no use saying so much!\u201d Seeing how he is still slightly reluctant to release his grip, Zhang Xuan kicks him away scornfully.What is this? It would be one thing for a female student hugging his leg. However, not only is he a male, he is also a fatty\u2026 He shivers just by the thought of it.\u201cFine! Look at my abilities!\u201d The fatty doesn't feel scorned. He stands up and surveys the surrounding. Then, he carries a few concrete blocks over from a short distance away. After which, lifting one up with his hands, he smashes his head into it.Peng!The concrete block shatters.After which, he carries a few more concrete block and shatters it using his elbow and leg. Without an exception, they all shatter.This fellow may seem plump, but he is skilled in henglian martial arts.Ignoring his henglian, Zhang Xuan is currently looking through the book that is automatically compiled in his mind.The skills trained through henglian can also be considered as a type of martial arts. The moment the fatty displays his prowess, the library began to compile his information.\u201cYuan Tao, a wandering cultivator in Dihuang City, Fighter 1-dan Juxi Realm Intermediate!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cFlaws: 18 aspects. No.1, the Ancient Emperor Bloodline in his body has yet to be activated! No.2, his foundations are too weak, the martial arts he trains in\u2026\u201d\u201cEmperor Bloodline?\u201dLooking at the records on the book, Zhang Xuan is taken aback.After merging with the memories of the previous owner of the body, he knows that in this world, bloodline and one's innate body is very important. As long as one possesses either one of the two along with a suitable method to utilize it, their cultivation will soar by leaps and bounds in the future, causing their strength to increase exponentially.There are many types of innate bodies such as Pure Yin Body, Pure Yang Body, Immaculate Body, Golden Body\u2026There are also many types of bloodline such as Ancient Bloodlines, New Bloodlines, inheritances and mutations\u2026Once found, every single one of them would become a target competed over by countless teachers.The Emperor Bloodline which the fatty possesses is one of the Ancient Bloodlines. It is said that when those who possess such bloodline reach the peak of their cultivation, their body would be impenetrable, no objects in the world would be able to break through their defenses. It is one of the most powerful bloodlines among defense-based bloodlines.This inconspicuous, fat and shameless fellow would actually possess an Ancient Bloodline?\u201cHis Ancient Bloodline has yet to be activated. From the looks of it, this fellow doesn't seem to be aware of it as well.\u201dA glint flashes through Zhang Xuan's eyes.Of all types of bloodlines, Ancient Bloodlines are quite powerful. For this fellow to not be accepted after visiting a dozen of teachers, it doesn't mean that they are unable to recognize such a bloodline. Rather, his bloodline has yet to be activated, causing him to be just like any other normal people. Not mentioning how other people aren't able to discern his bloodline, probably even he himself doesn't know about it!However, even if he doesn't know, he does have the potential in this aspect. His defensive abilities are much stronger than the others and that's the reason why he chose to train in this kind of 'punchbag' martial arts.\u201cI must accept this fellow under my tutelage!\u201dHis eyes twinkle.The entire academy might not even witness a single student possessing Ancient Bloodline throughout a course of multiple years. For such a good bud to appear before him, how can he possibly allow him to escape?\u201cNot bad. I will accept you as my student. Come, acknowledge me as your teacher!\u201dZhang Xuan suppresses the jubilation in his heart and throws an identity token over to him with a calm face.\u201cTeacher, are you really going to accept me? This is great\u2026\u201dThe fatty seems to have taken quite a few mental blows throughout the day. Upon hearing that a teacher is willing to accept him, he is so excited that he cuts his finger without second thoughts and squeezes a blood droplet on it.\u201cIt seems that the standard of the teacher determines the standard of the students he would accept. When the teacher is trash, the student would also be trash!\u201dAt this moment, a cold scorn sounds out.Turning around, Zhang Xuan sees a cold and arrogant young man walking over.There is a beautiful lady walking beside the young man. Her pitch-black silky hair flows down her shoulders, her pale skin has a creamy texture to it and her eyes captivate the gaze of those looking into it.\u201cShang Bin? Shen Bi Ru?\u201dUpon seeing the two of them, two names immediately float into his head.In the entire academy, there are probably no one who would be unaware of Shen Bi Ru!She doesn't have any unique background, but she is publicly acknowledged as a beautiful teacher. Even the school belle would pale in comparison when compared to her.It wouldn't have meant anything if she was all looks. The crux of it is that she is skilled in teaching as well. Despite being in this academy for less than a year, she has already become one of the most famous teachers in the academy.Noble, elegant, beautiful and intelligent, she attracts the frenzied pursuit of quite a few teachers.Zhang Xuan's previous self is also one of her pursuers.However, the previous Zhang Xuan was too much of a failure. Not mentioning his weak cultivation, he is also the last in all kinds of examinations. Due to his low self-esteem, even though he is interested in her, he has never talked to the goddess of his heart, needless to say, court her.This young man is called Shang Bin and he is the grandson of the academy's Elder Shang. He is also one of her pursuers and he has used his identity to suppress the other pursuers. He seems to have received word from some source that Zhang Xuan is also interested in Shen Bi Ru, prompting him to insult him whenever they meet, sometimes even resorting to physical violence.However, Shen Bi Ru doesn't seem to be interested in him. All along, she has been cold to everyone, as though she isn't interested in anyone at else, leaving Shang Bin distressed and helpless.\u201cWho are you insulting as trash?\u201d Hearing Shang Bin's unrestrained sarcasm, Zhang Xuan doesn't get angry and turns around to look over.\u201cTrash is insulting to you!\u201d Shang Bin smiles contemptuously.\u201cOh, so 'trash' is insulting to me. So smelly, so smelly!\u201d Zhang Xuan waves his hand in front of his nose, putting on a disgusted expression.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Only now does Shang Bin reacts. Being made fun of by the worst teacher in the academy, his face turns red.Emperor Bloodline <-> \u9f99\u7280\u8840\u8109 (Longxi Bloodline)In ancient China, they believe in like 'looking at one's facial features to determine one's future'. Naturally, there's a face for one destined for nobility as well. One of these noble faces is this Longxi face, which is usually termed as the face of an Emperor.This fellow may seem plump, but he is skilled in Henglian martial arts.TL: Henglian (\u6a2a\u7ec3) is a way of training and literally means 'training through brute strength'. There are 3 main ways of training in martial arts, Wenlian, Wulian and Henglian. According to baidu, the three different way of training will lead the martial artists to different peaks. Henglian refers to a method which uses 'smashing of one's body onto a hard object' in order to train their body parts. Even today, Henglian is still used as a way of training by a few (like the Iron Head Skills, they smash their head on solid objects from young)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13: Shameless StudentTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexUpon hearing those words, the ice-cold Shen Bi Ru smiles faintly.Although this roundabout manner of insulting another means nothing on Earth, it is an incomparably novel concept here.Seeing the expression on his goddess, Shang Bin feels that he is being mocked. His face flushes in a moment and pales in the next. However, in front of the female goddess, he is determined to maintain uphold decorum, thus he doesn't dare to attack Zhang Xuan directly.\"Why? Is there something wrong with my words?\" Suppressing his anger, Shang Bin sneers. \"There isn't a single person who doesn't know what your standards are in the entire academy! This fatty came to my classroom previously. Fat like a pig, he only knows how to defend and nothing else! The strength behind his fist is only a mere 15 kilograms! He must be either the first or second from the bottom in the entrance examination, so if he isn't trash, what is he?\"Even though he can't teach Zhang Xuan a lesson physically, he is resolute to strike a blow onto him through his words.\"The first from the bottom in the entrance examination?\" Zhang Xuan only paid attention to the Emperor Bloodline and wasn't aware of such a situation. He turns around to look at the fatty.\"Who says that I am the first from the bottom?\" The fatty retorts confidently. Then, he scratches his head in embarrassment, \"I am only... the 9997th place!\"\"9997th place? Only?\" A faint spell afflicts Zhang Xuan and he almost vomits blood.Hongtian Academy only accepts 10000 students every year. Although it recruits so many people every year, there are always several students who fail to report due to several reasons. 9997th place, it is almost as good as being in the last place, alright!Besides... With such a low ranking, how can you still be so confident...Zhang Xuan feels as though he hasn't fully woken up.\"It can't be that you accept anyone who is a student?\" Shang Bin sneers once again. Then, flinging his sleeves, an arrogant look appears on his face as he declares, \"I have a clear requirement when accepting students. I don't accept anyone who is below the 500th in rank! The teacher who is first from the bottom and the student who is first from the bottom... How compatible! Haha!\"\"Are you done talking?\"Towards his mockery, Zhang Xuan simply shakes his head, \"Now that you're done, you can leave!\"Previously, he has examined Yuan Tao clearly with the Library of Heaven's Path. That fatty is a wandering cultivator, so it is normal for him to know no cultivation technique and martial arts. As long as he finds a way to activate his Emperor Bloodline, his cultivation would definitely soar by leaps and bounds.\"You...\"If it was someone else, being mocked to such an extent, they would definitely be trembling from anger. However, this fellow doesn't even bat an eyelid to it. For Shang Bin's attack to land on thin air, his face turns even uglier.\"It seems that a rotten wood cannot be carved!\" After a cold humph, Shang Bin looks at Shen Bi Ru beside him and says, \"Bi Ru laoshi, let's go. If we stay with this kind of trash for too long, we would be contaminated by them!\"Hearing Shang Bin's direct sarcasm, Shen Bi Ru frowns and chooses not to leave with him. Instead, she turns around, \"Zhang Xuan laoshi!\"Her voice is like an oriole, clear and enchanting, stirring up complex emotions in its listeners.\"Hm?\" Zhang Xuan didn't expect that the academy's prettiest teacher would initiate a conversation with him, he is taken aback.\"Although the previous time you... didn't score so well for your Teacher Qualification Examination, do not give up on yourself. Work hard and you will find yourself rewarded in the end!\"Shen Bi Ru nods her head.From her point of view, Zhang Xuan accepting one of the worst students means that he doesn't hold any hope and has given up on himself.Towards this ex-pursuer of hers, even if she doesn't fancy him, she doesn't hope to see him wallowing in his failures.\"Thank you for your advice!\" He knows that the other party is truly concerned for him. Zhang Xuan nods his head and explains, \"This student, although he might not be anything now, he could turn out to be a jade. As long as I guide him properly, it isn't impossible for him to shine!\"\"Un!\"Shen Bi Ru doesn't speak any further and instead starts to walk away.She thinks that Zhang Xuan's explanation is only an excuse. Given Yuan Tao's size and his lack of basic knowledge at his age, there is bound to be a limit to his future achievements.\"Darn it!\"Seeing the goddess of his heart talking to the worst teacher in the academy and even motivating him, Shang Bin's face distorts savagely. The inferno in his heart rages as he stares at Zhang Xuan coldly before following behind Shen Bi Ru.\"Bi Ru, it is better for you to avoid contact with this kind of people, it will sully your flawless disposition...\"\"Shang laoshi, I am a little tired today and would like to rest. I hope that you do not follow me...\"Before Shang Bin could finish his words, Shen Bi Ru turns around to leave.\"Damn it, damn it! Zhang Xuan, just you wait. I will definitely get back at you for this!\"He watches as his goddess walk further and further away before she disappears from sight. At this moment, he has already directed all of his anger towards Zhang Xuan.In his opinion, if it wasn't for that inauspicious fellow, the goddess would definitely have dinner with him. How could it be possible for her to turn around to leave?....................................\"Since you have acknowledged me as your teacher, you must know where my classroom is!\"After the both of them left, Zhang Xuan turns his attention away from them and calls out to the fatty.\"Great!\" The fatty hurriedly stands up and smiles at him. \"Teacher, now that I am your student, can you tell me which teacher are you in the academy?\"Hearing his words, Zhang Xuan grabs his forehead.This fellow, to think that he acknowledged whichever teacher he manages to set his eyes upon, not even clarifying Zhang Xuan's identity beforehand.\"I am Zhang Xuan!\" Zhang Xuan says.\"Zhang Xuan laoshi? The Zhang laoshi who scored... first from the bottom for the Teacher Qualification Examination, not to mention a zero...\" At this moment, fatty finally realizes who he acknowledged as his teacher. The fats on his body tremble as his lip twitches. All he is lacking now is tears.\"That's me!\"Zhang Xuan nods his head.\"Ah... That, Zhang laoshi!\" Fatty scratches his head. \"Seeing how I am weak and dim-witted, not to mention fat, why don't you... take me out from your lessons!\"Zhang Xuan: \"...\"\"Teacher, I am being serious over here. The two teachers from a moment ago have also said it. If you don't expel me from your tutelage, your reputation would be sullied. I am afraid of pulling you down with me...\" Fatty continues.\"I am not afraid of being pulled down. Besides, now that we have verified our relationship through the identity token, I only have a sentence for you. You will live as my student and die as my student. Stop talking about useless things here!\" Zhang Xuan waves his hand.\"I...\"Fatty's face distorts and he is on the verge of crying.Due to his weakness, he wanted to acknowledge a good student so that his future could be boundless. However, never would he dream that the last place student would be paired with the last place teacher.Why is my life so difficult...\"Alright, this is my classroom. Now, claim your bedding and remember to come to lessons punctually tomorrow!\"Zhang Xuan says impatiently.\"This classroom...\"Looking at the size of the classroom, fatty finds himself on the verge of tears yet again.Even the locations where he underwent the entrance examination previously were much bigger than this. A classroom of this size probably can't hold many students!\"Teacher, if I... don't come tomorrow, would you expel me?\"Fatty is still bearing illusions in his mind.\"Expel? That I won't. However, I will throw you into the lake which you wanted to jump into to feed the turtles!\" Zhang Xuan nods his head seriously. \"Didn't I say it? You will live as my student and die as my student. Relax, I will fulfill the role of my teacher and bury you properly...\"\"Teacher!\" Before Zhang Xuan could finish his words, he was interrupted by fatty. With a serious face and unwavering will in his eyes, he says, \"What time do we start lessons tomorrow? I will come in advance to clean the classroom! It is my honor to meet such a great teacher. In the future, no matter who wants to admit me as their disciple, I will reject them firmly and reprimand them...\"Zhang Xuan: \"...\"Initially, Zhang Xuan thought that he himself is shameless. However, he didn't expect that his student would be even more shameless than he is!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14: Cultivation TechniqueTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexIt wasn't easy for Zhang Xuan arrange everything properly with fatty and send him away. Only then did he realize that the sun is already setting in the west and it is about to turn dark soon.\u201cLooks like I only have five students!\u201dHe shakes his head.Today is the last day to recruit students. Judging from the current time, it is probably the end of the recruitment.Initially, he thought that he wouldn't even recruit a student. He didn't expect that he would end up pulling five students in. For a teacher who scored the worst in the Teacher Qualification Examination, it isn't a bad result.Closing the doors to the classroom, Zhang Xuan follows the path back to his room based on his memory.As a teacher of the academy, he has a dormitory room of his own. However, it is only a small room of around a dozen meter square large.Soon, he reaches the dormitory. Pushing the door open and looking at the sight within, he couldn't help but sigh.His previous self really had it bad. Not mentioning how the room is small, it is extremely humid. Mold is growing on some of the bedding and such. He really has no idea how that fellow managed to survive like this.\u201cLet's forget about this first. Lessons are going to start tomorrow so I have to first ascertain my level of cultivation and try training a bit!\u201dSince he isn't hungry now anyway, Zhang Xuan follows the method he recalls in his memories and sits with crossed legs on the bed.As a transcender, although he has inherited the memories of his previous self and isn't foreign to cultivating, he is still quite excited at the thought of growing stronger.After he is done with the recruitment, it is about time for him to solidify his cultivation. No matter what, in this world, strength reigns supreme.The Library of Heaven's Path is capable of to identifying other's mingmen and flaws, allowing him to easily break through the defenses of opponents of the same level. However, if his enemy is much stronger than he is, even if he is able to identify the gaps in their attacks, he is unable to keep up with them speed-wise. Before he could injure his opponent, he might already have been severed into multiple pieces like a lab rat.Thus, even though the Library of Heaven's Path is formidable, it doesn't ensure his invincibility. If he wants to become stronger, cultivation is the way to go!\u201cThe cultivation technique of my previous self is called the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula! It is a skill created by the founder of Hongtian Academy. The skill consists of nine dans, with each of the dan corresponding to the cultivation realm of the cultivator!\u201dHe recalls the skill memorized in his head.There are nine dans to a cultivator and every level opens up a new realm. The higher one climbs, the harder it is to cultivate.Hongtian Nine Dan Formula is one of the most common cultivation technique in Hongtian Academy. It also consists of nine dans which correspond to the cultivator's nine dans.\u201cRight now, I am the weakest of all of the teachers in the academy!\u201dIn the academy, almost all teachers have reached Fighter 4-dan, leaving him to be the only 3-dan. Thus, he has to train harder to catch up to them.Following the exhalation method in his memory, he focuses his concentration.In an instant, countless bright particles appear before him as he slowly inhales and exhales while absorbing them. Gradually, the zhenqi within his dantian enriches.After cultivating for an unknown period of time, Zhang Xuan opens his eyes and shakes his head.\u201cThis is way too slow!\u201dEven though he has inherited the memories of his previous self, his consciousness still remains that of an earthling. He finds it difficult to be sitting still to cultivate for long periods of time.Especially upon viewing the process of the gathering of zhenqi, he feels even more helpless.Gathering zhenqi refers to the action of pulling and gathering in the spirit particles in the air and suppressing them together. Just like the stacking of logs, they would be accumulated to form a river.This is an extremely huge project. There are some cultivators who persist in it every day without fail and fills up their dantian within three years to break into higher realms.It is a work that requires accumulation over time.To cultivate so blandly for multiple years?You might as well kill him!\u201cOh, that's right! Although the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula is the most popular cultivation technique in the academy, it isn't the strongest one. I can use the Library of Heaven's Path to seek out its flaws and find a way to correct them. Once I correct the flaws, won't my training be much more efficient?\u201dA thought pops into his mind.There are different tiers to cultivation technique as well. Better cultivation technique allows one to cultivate faster while the weak ones cause one to cultivate at a slower pace. Could it be that the better cultivation technique has fewer flaws, causing the difference between the two?Other people might be unable to improve their cultivation technique, but Zhang Xuan is different. With the Library of Heaven's Path in hand, he could make use of it to seek out the flaws in it and think of a way to correct them. If he were to create a cultivation technique where even the Library of Heaven's Path is unable to find a flaw in, won't his cultivation speed soar significantly?At this point, Zhang Xuan stands up, places the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula in his palm and starts flipping through it.Hu!Just as he expected, the library in his mind jolts and a book with the exact same name appears in it.Opening the book gently, he realized that there are countless flaws on the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula on it, numbering more than a thousand!\u201cThis is the skill that I was training with a moment ago?\u201d Zhang Xuan is shocked.Just a simple 3-dan and there are countless flaws in it, isn't this way too much!It is just like eating a vegetable full of worms! Zhang Xuan feels that it is already incredible that his cultivation hasn't disappeared after training in that skill.\u201cWhat about the other cultivation techniques?\u201dAs a teacher, there are quite a few books in his room, \u300aSupreme Four Inscription\u300b, \u300aHeaven Meridian Technique\u300b, \u300aLotus Acupoint Breakthrough Might\u300b\u2026 As he casually picks each of them and flips through them, the library would automatically compile a corresponding book on it that records all kinds of flaws in the skill. For these skills, the flaws that are recorded exceeds 3000!That is even scarier than the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula!\u201cThis\u2026 Won't I die out of exhaustion while searching for a way to correct all of those?\u201d After taking a look, Zhang Xuan feels like he is about to go mad from frustration.It is hard to find a correct path when there are more than a thousand flaws in a secret manual. It is like having a thousand different paths before you and each of which have countless divergence to them. Even if the Library of Heaven's Path is capable of ascertaining whether the path is right or not, finding the most accurate path would definitely tire him to death!\u201cRight now, my cultivation is at Fighter 3-dan Zhenqi Pinnacle, just a little bit away from breaking through. Right now, I only have to find the flaw in the secret manual regarding this aspect and correct it!\u201dUpon seeing the countless mistakes in Hongtian Nine Dan Formula, he knows that it is impossible for him to resolve them in a short period of time. Thus, he flips the manual to the very last page.It is difficult to train in the Fighter 3-dan, but the last step to breaking through is significantly easier.As he expected, there are only ten flaws in this page.\u201cError in the method in sensing the spirit in the air, error in manipulating the flow of spirit particles, error in guiding the gathered spirit to flow through the Yangwei Meridian\u2026\u201dThe ten flaws that written here are detailed clearly.The Library of Heaven's Path only records flaws, it doesn't list methods to resolving them. It isn't easy to search for the correct path one should take.\u201cRight! It seems that the parts of the Fighter 3-dan breakthrough method in the other books have different flaws from this!\u201dA thought flashes through his mind as he recalls what is written in the other secret manuals. Thus, he flips through the other books to view the portion of it about breaking through the Zhenqi realm.It is indeed as he recalls. Although there are mistakes in those as well, their errors are in different aspects.\u201cIf it isn't demarcated as an error, then it should be correct\u2026\u201d Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up. He immediately grabs pen and paper and jots down the correct portion of each of them. Soon, a new cultivation method appears before him.\u201cLet's see if there are errors in this!\u201dWith a faint smile, he grabs the book that he had just written and the Library of Heaven's Path jolts once more. A similar book appears, just that this time, there's only one error in it.After researching for a moment longer, he corrects this final error and uses the Library of Heaven's Path to ascertain once again. Indeed, all of the errors have been filled up and it is in its perfect form.\u201cThis is the most precise method to break through Fighter 3-dan realm! Let me give it a try!\u201dLooking at the contents he wrote himself, Zhang Xuan nods his head excitedly. He hurriedly gets into position and starts to cultivate.\u201cRelax my body and allow my pores to open, as though I am sinking into a tub of spirit air. Every single pore of mine is a complete lifeform by itself, breathing by its own will\u2026\u201dTzzzzzzzzzzzzz!Cultivating through this method, although he isn't very used to it at the start, it didn't take long for him to feel the spirit in the surrounding surge into him. The spirit absorbed by a single pore may not be much, but when all of the pores of a body are undergoing the same process concurrently, the absorption speed is one to behold.The spirit in the air gathers like a flowing river, forming a giant flood in his body and rushes towards his dantian.Boom!An explosion echoes from his spirit sea. Initially, he was just a step away to breaking through his bottleneck. At the current moment, zhenqi overflows from his dantian and courses through his entire body, enriching his muscles and bones, generating a refreshing sensation.Figher 4-dan, Pigu realm!\u201cThis\u2026 this is too fast!\u201d Zhang Xuan's eyes widen.Based on what is recorded on the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula, he would need to take at least three to five months to break through, and this would still require a certain amount of luck. After slightly modifying the skill to correct the flaws on it, how long did he take in comparison?Ten minutes? Five minutes?Probably, he didn't even take three minutes to successfully achieve a breakthrough!This\u2026Furthermore, despite only correcting the breakthrough method for Fighter 3-dan Pinnacle, the purity of the zhenqi he absorbed is incomparably pure, containing much more power as compared to the ones he cultivated in the past!If the zhenqi he cultivated in the past is sloppy mud, then this wave is a clear spring water without any impurities in it.There are also different tiers to zhenqi, superior, intermediate and inferior. The higher the quality, the more clear it would be and the further one would be able to climb in the future! In the past, the zhenqi he cultivates is murky and probably of inferior quality.The ones he are cultivating is so clear that you could see through it. Most probably, it is zhenqi of superior quality.\u201cDidn't they say that\u2026 if one wants to cultivate superior zhenqi, they would require a god or saint cultivation technique?\u201dThere are different tiers to a cultivation technique as well, namely god, saint, spirit, phantom and mortal. In each tier, they are classified further into inferior, intermediate, superior and pinnacle.Based on rumors among cultivators, one would need at least a saint cultivation technique in order to cultivate superior zhenqi.Hongtian Nine Dan Formula is the lowest mortal cultivation technique, so how could it cultivate zhenqi of such quality?\u201cIt is the Library of Heaven's Path!\u201dZhang Xuan clenches his fist.He is still cultivating the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula, but as he managed to avoid the mistakes recorded on it and followed the correct path upwards, he is able to gather superior zhenqi.It seems that\u2026 what is recorded on the Library of Heaven's Path is accurate. The Hongtian Nine Dan Formula is indeed too far from perfection.\u201cIf so, with the help of the Library of Heaven's Path, could it be possible for me to create a book of saint or even god cultivation technique?\u201dZhang Xuan's eyes twinkle.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15: Heaven's Path Divine ArtTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexNeedless to say Hongtian Academy, even those top sects might not even have god or saint cultivation technique. Besides, even they have it, it is hidden deep inside the sect and normal people would be unable to obtain it.What he wants to do is to create such a skill so that his training would be more efficient so as to hasten the rate of the rise of his cultivation by leaps and bounds!\u201cI don't have any 4-dan cultivation method. Let me go to the Teacher Compendium Pavilion to take a look!\u201dPracticing the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula, the cultivator can only retrieve the secret manual for the next realm after breaking through their current realm. At this moment, he only has the cultivation method for 3-dan. He has yet to see the one for 4-dan.Walking out, the sun hasn't set for too long and there are still quite a few passers-by on the road.The bright moonlight reflects on the surface of the pavement, dying it with a layer of silver. A few couples who had just tasted the forbidden fruit are snuggling under the tree as they whisper sweet nothings to one another. Even so, the surroundings have a serene atmosphere.Zhang Xuan didn't bother himself with these. Instead, he hastens his footsteps and soon, a giant pavilion appears before him.The Compendium Pavilion is split into two main sectors, teacher and student. Within it lies the compendium of all kinds of secret manuals and cultivation techniques. It is one of the most important locations in the entire academy.\u201cElder Mo!\u201dWalking to the entrance, he bows to an elderly who is sitting at a proximity from the great door.Elder Mo is one of the guardians of the Compendium Pavilion. It is unknown what realm he has reached but it is said that he is ranked among the top in the academy in terms of his strength. However, as he hasn't fought for many years, no one could tell his actual strength for sure.\u201cYou're here! You have reached Fighter 4-dan?\u201dElder Mo looks over and strokes his sparse beard.\u201cIt is just luck!\u201d Zhang Xuan doesn't try to conceal the fact that he has reached Fighter 4-dan.\u201cGood, good. Train harder, the academy still needs young blood like you!\u201d Elder Mo nods his head in satisfaction.\u201cYes!\u201d Zhang Xuan doesn't continue speaking and instead, lifts his leg to walk into the room.The moment he leaves, Elder Mo shakes his head and laments, \u201cHe is a good child, just that he is lacking a little in talent and is slightly too slow in his cultivation!\u201dOther cultivators take around two years to break through Fighter 3-dan whereas Zhang Xuan took a whole three years to do so. His talent is indeed subpar.\u201cUpon reaching Fighter 4-dan, if he were to train properly, he should still be able to become an average teacher. Just that, I hope he doesn't score too badly for him Teacher Qualification Examination the next time\u2026\u201dAfter muttering for a bit, Elder Mo doesn't go on any further and shuts his eyes once more.Zhang Xuan is one of the more polite ones among the numerous young teachers. He doesn't really like him, but neither does he dislike him. It is just that he finds it lamentable for him to be lacking in talent.Oblivious to the mutterings of Elder Mo, Zhang Xuan walks into the Compendium Pavilion.Although the Hongtian Academy's Compendium Pavilion is of significant size, nowhere paling in comparison to the working location of his previous life, it is still much smaller than the Library of Heaven's Path in his mind.The two aren't even on the same level.He walks quickly to the cultivation technique section and to the fourth row of it.Indeed, the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula 4-dan cultivation technique is in here.Reaching out to grab it, he casually flips through it.Hu!A similar secret manual appears in his mind. Taking a look, it is around the same as the one for 3-dan, there are more than a thousand flaws.\u201cThere are other secret manuals here as well. Let me take a look at them as well!\u201dAfter the prior experience with breaking through, Zhang Xuan doesn't focus on the flaws in it and instead looks towards the bookshelf before him.On the bookshelf of the fourth row, there is an amazing amount of different kinds of cultivation technique manuals. They are all cultivation techniques for 4-dan and there is quite are plenty of notes and explanations in them left behind by predecessors. Just by a rough look, there are around a few thousand of them.If it is someone else, their eyes would definitely blur from the sight. After all, there are so many books with countless notes left in them. Furthermore, some of the theories for the cultivation techniques are at ends with each other, so it is hard to gauge whether which one is the right one. If one were to randomly cultivate without knowing better, it is possible for them to go berserk.However, Zhang Xuan is different. Possessing the Library of Heaven's Path, he is capable of telling which one is the right one. He doesn't hesitate to grab a book and flip through it.Hu!A similar book appears in his mind.Zhang Xuan doesn't stop and picks up the next one.He isn't browsing through them nor picking them. Rather, he is trying to increase the number of books in the Library of Heaven's Path so that he could derive a more precise cultivation method.Hualala!The sound of flipping pages fills the entire room.\u201cA weak will. Impatient and unrealistic!\u201dHearing those words, Elder Mo frowns.Since Zhang Xuan has already chosen to cultivate in the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula, then he shouldn't think about any other skills. He should make use of the time to copy the formula for the 4-dan so that he can analyze it and start training. Although it is possible to make use the strengths of others to make up for the flaws of one, the more miscellaneous knowledge one reads, the easier it is for one to get impatient and rash. In the end, it is a small thing if he achieves nothing in the end. If things go wrong, it is very possible for him to go berserk and ruin his cultivation!Thirty years ago, a talented genius blessed with great talents who thought he is much greater than others insisted on looking through the various cultivation techniques to create an ultimate one tailored to him. In the end, due to reading too many manuals, he became uncertain of the route he should walk on and his cultivation went berserk. As an individual, he became insane as well.Being greedy would cause indigestion!This is the absolute truth and reality.For him to take three years to break through Zhenqi realm, his talent is apparent. With such talent, he should just obediently cultivate 4-dan of Hongtian Nine Dan Formula. Yet, he chooses to flip through other manuals. Is he just trying to seek for something thrilling?With one look, one could tell he is an unrealistic fellow!The good impression that he holds towards Zhang Xuan disappears without a trace.\u201cPutting on a show just to obtain the fleeting praises of the crowd!\u201dAfter a cold harrumph, he realizes that Zhang Xuan is just casually flipping through without taking a careful look at them. Elder Mo's eyebrows knit even closer together and he feels a little disgusted with him.If one were to study those manual closer, even though they are being unrealistic, they would still obtain some knowledge on them. However, this fellow simply casually flips through it and given the speed he flips at, even Elder Mo himself is unable to look through the contents properly. If so, what can a lad who had just reached Fighter 4-dan see?Now, he is truly putting on a show to obtain the fleeting praises of the crowd!\u201cThe academy's culture is really degenerating, getting worse with each passing generation!\u201dAfter those words, he shuts his eyes, refusing to bother with this unrealistic fellow anymore.\u201cI'm done!\u201dHis pace of browsing is extremely fast. He is able to finish flipping through a normal manual in just one or two breaths. In two hour, he finished browsing through all of the cultivation manuals and thousands of identical books had appeared in the Library of Heaven's Path.\u201cTime to return to assess them!\u201dKnowing that his aim has been achieved, he smiles and walks towards the outside without hesitation.\u201cYou aren't going to copy any notes?\u201dSeeing him leaving empty-handed, Elder Mo couldn't resist asking.Even if he is unrealistic, he should at least copy the secret manual so that he can analyze it after returning to his living quarters. Coming and leaving empty-handed, are you coming here to play?\u201cIt's okay, I am actually just taking a casual look\u2026\u201dUnsure about what the other party is thinking about, Zhang Xuan smiles and takes his leave.\u201cTaking a casual look? Frivolous! The academy should punish this fellow! How can such a frivolous person be a teacher!\u201d Elder Mo waves his hand in anger.Cultivation manuals are the core of every cultivator and every cultivator should hold some respect towards them. However, this fellow only came to take a look and returns back after casually flipping through them. His behavior is unacceptable!Looks like he should have a talk with the principal to deal with these teachers who are sullying the culture of the academy.Returning back to his living quarters, Zhang Xuan takes out pen and papers and flips through the Hongtian Nine Dan Formula 4-dan manual to copy down the correct portions of it.Then, he takes out another book and copies down the correct portions as well.After flipping through a few of them, Zhang Xuan rubs his temples.It is actually quite troublesome and tiring to flip through a few thousand books like that. It isn't as simple as he thought it would be.Just when he is thinking about how he could hasten his pace, his mind suddenly jolts again.The thousands of book that was just compiled in the Library of Heaven's Path crumple and slowly merge as one.Weng!The few thousand books merge together completely with a crisp sound to form a single book.There isn't any name on the book. Zhang Xuan casually flips through it.\u201cThis\u2026 is the compilation of the correct routes in the few thousand secret manuals?\u201dAfter taking a look at it, Zhang Xuan's face flushes red from excitement.Previously, he was still troubled by how he could find the correct route out of a few thousand of books. It would have been an arduous task taking a long period of time. Never in his dreams would he expect that the library would compile it automatically!\u201cThis book\u2026 there isn't a single flaw in it!\u201dThe nameless book is the compilation of all of the correct cultivation route and there isn't a single flaw in it.The contents of it is no longer Hongtian Nine Dan Formula or any one of the individual manual that was compiled into it. It could be said to be something no one has ever seen before.\u201cSince it is the correct method chosen and compiled by the Library of Heaven's Path, let's call it [ Heaven's Path Divine Art ]!\u201dA thought flashes through his mind and he decides on the name of the nameless manual.Weng!As though sensing his thoughts, the empty cover trembles and four words appear on it.Heaven's Path Divine Art!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16: Cleansing Muscles and BonesTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Let me give it a try!\"After obtaining a cultivation technique without any flaws, Zhang Xuan doesn't hesitate to follow the method recorded in the Heaven's Path Divine Art and starts to meditate.The pores on his body widens as he absorbs spirit energy from the air into his body.Fighter 4-dan.1-dan Juxi, 2-dan Dantian, 3-dan Zhenqi, 4-dan Pigu.Juxi realm, cultivators would learn innate breathing and sensing of spirit in the air. Also, they would gain the ability to look into their body and control the flow of spirit energy in their body with their mind.Dantian realm, the opening up of a cultivator's dantian to allow it to hold spirit energy as well as to reform his body, turning a normal human into a true Fighter.Zhenqi realm, the gathering of the spirit energy in the dantian to create zhenqi.Pigu realm, the zhenqi-filled Dantian will overflow and enrich one's body, causing the cultivator's physical body to become powerful. The capabilities of their organs will also be strengthened, thus turning them into true experts.The first three dans of a Fighter are the building of foundations. Only at the 4-dan does one the result of one's cultivation truly reflects on one's body, causing one to stray away from illnesses and become stronger.The cultivation method of Hongtian Nine Dan Manual is to make use of the zhenqi overflowing from the dantian to nourish one's body, thus reforming and tempering one's bones, muscles, tendons and skin.However, the Heaven's Path Divine Art is different. It uses the spirit energy from the surrounding to nourish one's body while having the zhenqi in one's body overflow to the other parts of the body at the same time.Gugugugu!The stream of spirit energy flows through his veins towards his entire body. The zhenqi would mend and fill up the incomplete parts as it flows through his veins.Gezhi! Gezhi!It didn't take long for the infusion of both spirit energy and zhenqi to strengthen his bones and muscles. It feels as though it has been tempered with concentrated fire as it turns clear, emitting a warm glow.Boom!After the zhenqi circulates around his body for an unknown number of times, his body suddenly jolts and he feels as though he has broken through a certain bottleneck. A surge of relaxation gushes through his body.Previously, his body feels as though it has been bound by some shackles but now, his entire body feels light and he has perfect control over every single motion of his. It feels as though he has been broken through his cocoon to be reborn as a butterfly.\"Fighter 4-dan Pigu realm... I have finished cultivating in this realm?\"Opening his eyes, Zhang Xuan is still in a state of disbelief.The sign of breaking through the Pigu realm is the destruction of the shackles of one's body, allowing one to ascend into greater heights. How long has he been training? Two hours? Four hours?\"Pungent!\"Curious, he looks at his body and realizes that there is a layer of filth on the surface of his skin.Pigu realm is the nourishment of one's body using zhenqi, expelling the impurities within one's body and cleansing one's muscles and bones, thus reforming their body.From birth, humans would ingest all kinds of food for survival. As a result, they would accumulate more and more impurities in their body. In the Pigu realm, through the nourishment of zhenqi, one cleanses their body of impurities and only then are they able to break through the shackles of their body and return back to nature.\"I have long heard of the Pigu realm, but... I have never seen anyone who can expel so much impurities!\"Smelling the pungent smell from his body, Zhang Xuan couldn't take it anymore. He grabs a pail and cleans himself while muttering under his breath.Figher 4-dan Pigu realm is the cleansing of one's muscles and bones. It is already not bad for one to strengthen their body just by a small bit in one sitting. He has never heard of a person expelling so much impurities that their entire body would stink from it.Very quickly, he finished cleaning himself. At this moment, Zhang Xuan suddenly realizes that his body is as clear as a jade and as smooth as a mirror. All of the scars which he accumulated from his previous training sessions have disappeared without a trace. Right now, he is just like a newborn infant, perhaps even smoother than a newborn infant.\"My zhenqi...\"Surprised by the changes in his body, his attention turns to his dantian. His entire body trembles.The murky zhenqi that was in his dantian previously has turned to become as clear and water and it is emitting refreshing fragrance.Without a doubt, it is definitely superior zhenqi!\"Not only is my body enhanced, even the quality of my zhenqi has improved. This... Heaven's Path Divine Art is too powerful!\"Zhang Xuan is taken aback.To break through Pigu realm, others have to continually nourish their body for at least a few years. However, he took less than four hours to break through the realm directly. Not only so, the quality of his zhenqi has been refined. Exactly what kind of secret manual has the Library of Heaven's Path created?This is way too powerful!\"Let me test my strength! Upon breaking through Pigu realm, one would reach Fighter 5-dan Dingli. The moment a cultivator steps into this realm, they will possess one ding of strength!\"He walks over to the Strength Measuring Rock Pillar which is just a few dozen meters away from the dormitory.This kind of Strength Measuring Rock Pillar can be found around the academy so as to allow the students to measure their strength at anytime and anywhere.Upon reaching Fighter 5-dan Dingli, one would possess one ding of strength, which is around a thousand kilograms.This kind of strength already exceeds the limits of an ordinary human and is on par with horses and bulls.After practicing the Heaven's Path Divine Art, Zhang Xuan's body has been reformed and he has broken through the Pigu realm. This is an opportunity for him to test how much strength the possesses. Will it be like in the rumors, that he would possess one ding of strength?Gathering and controlling his breath, the sole of the feet clutches onto the ground. Suddenly, his knees spring forth and his entire body immediately takes on the shape of a giant bow while his arm bursts forth from him like an arrow.Peng!His fist strikes on the stone pillar and a glint of light flow on it.\"5 ding!\"A number appears on it.\"How... how... is this possible?\"Zhang Xuan narrows his eyes and a dumbfounded look covers his entire face.Is this for real?For a normal dingli primary stage, one would possess one ding of strength. In the intermediate stage, one would possess two ding of strength. In the advanced stage, three ding of strength and in the pinnacle, four ding of strength!Yet, despite barely breaking through the Pigu realm to Dingli realm, he actually possesses five ding of strength... What is going on?Isn't this too exaggerated!\"It must be due to the nourishment of my body by the Heaven's Path Divine Art and the superior zhenqi in my body...\"After a short moment, Zhang Xuan recovers from the shock and infers.He is very clear that he isn't a genius.The only explanation for it is the Heaven's Path Divine Art which he has just cultivated with.Not only does this cultivation technique temper and reforms his physical body and cleanses his zhenqi, raising it to superior quality, it also increases his strength significantly, thus granting him the strength beyond that of Dingli pinnacle expert despite just reaching the Dingli realm.Fearsome!\"There is only a few esteemed teacher in the academy who reached Fighter 5-dan!\"In the academy, only some of the higher level teachers possess the strength of a Fighter 5-dan Dingli realm. People like Cao Xiong and him could never hope to reach such heights.\"Now that I have reached this level, I should go and look for the cultivation technique for 5-dan...\"While his strength soars rapidly, a problem arises.The multitude of 4-dan cultivation techniques that he flipped through in the Teacher Compendium Pavilion previously are useless now. If he wants to continue cultivating, he has to look for 5-dan cultivation techniques.\"Right now, it isn't too late. The Teacher Compendium Pavilion shouldn't be closed yet...\"Scratching his head, Zhang Xuan walks over the Compendium Pavilion once more.In order to prevent people from getting greedy and hasty in their training, the academy imposed a rule that one can only view cultivation techniques that correspond to the level of their cultivation.It didn't take long for Zhang Xuan to arrive at the Compendium Pavilion once more.\"Why are you here again?\"Seeing that it's the same guy from a moment ago, the custodian, Elder Mo, frowns.This impractical fellow just left the pavilion not long ago. Why is he back again?\"Elder Mo, I would like to view the cultivation technique for 5-dan!\" Zhang Xuan is a little awkward.He can't possibly say that he broke through after leaving for just a short moment!If he were to say that, the other fellow would either kill him or kidnap him to examine him like a lab rat.There isn't much of a change in zhenqi between Pigu realm and Dingli realm. As long he doesn't manipulate his zhenqi, it is difficult for even experts to tell the difference. Elder Mo may be strong, but it is inconceivable to him that this youth might have broken to greater heights in the short moment he was gone.\"5-dan cultivation technique? What do you want it for?\"Elder Mo's face darkens. His final sliver of appreciation towards his fellow disappears.He didn't copy any notes on the 4-dan cultivation technique and didn't try to cultivate it. Yet, he is back now to look at the 5-dan? What kind of joke is this!\"Elder Mo, it is like this. Today, I accepted a student and his parent asked me some questions about 5-dan cultivation. I was unable to answer it, causing him to look down on him. Thus... I would like to take a look and derive an answer to it. This way, I would be able to deal with these questions in the future!\"Zhang Xuan has already thought of an excuse beforehand.\"Some parents are indeed troublesome to deal with!\" Hearing this explanation, Elder Mo nods his head. With a solemn expression, he says, \"You can take a look, but do not cultivate them by any means! If you try to cultivate 5-dan without even breaking through 4-dan, even deities would be unable to save you when you go berserk!\"\"Yes, I understand that!\"Zhang Xuan hurriedly replies.\"Alright, enter!\" Elder Mo waves his hand and closes his eyes. \"The 5-dan cultivation technique are on the very last row!\"\"Yes!\" Zhang Xuan hurriedly enters.\"Hypocritical! Vain!\"After entering, Elder Mo adds two more words to his evaluation of Zhang Xuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17: AssassinationTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexSo what if the parents ask about it? You are the lowest level teacher, it is normal that you can't answer their questions!So, in order to put on a show, you specially came here to view the 5-dan cultivation technique. If this isn't being hypocritical and vain, what is it?\u201cTomorrow, I will look for the principal and have this unrealistic fellow expelled!\u201dScoffing coldly in his heart, Old Mo's mind is resolute.Leaving such a vain fellow who doesn't cultivate properly in the academy will just sully the culture of the academy!Zhang Xuan doesn't know that the two meetings with Elder Mo have placed him in the expulsion list of the latter. If he were to know, he would have no idea whether he should burst into laughter or weep in tears.Those words that he said are only excuses!In reality, his cultivation has reached such a level!He can't possibly stop training due to the lack of cultivation technique.Very quickly, he found the very last row of the cultivation technique section.Even the most famous and powerful teacher in the academy is Fighter 5-dan. The moment one breaks through into the 6-dan Pixue realm, they would automatically become an elder in the academy.This is only the Teacher Compendium Pavilion, so there aren't any records on the 6-dan cultivation techniques. Thus, the 5-dan cultivation techniques are placed on the very last shelf.\u201cThere are significantly less 5-dan manuals than 4-dan!\u201dThere are around 2000 to 3000 cultivation technique secret manuals on the 4-dan whereas there are only 1000 on the 5-dan.However, it is also a natural occurrence when one thinks about it. No matter what it is, the higher one climbs, the scarcer the resources. Although the academy has been present for a long time, there are definitely significantly less 5-dan than 4-dan in its entire history.As a result, the cultivation techniques and notes they leave behind would be fewer as well.Shaking his head, he decided not to contemplate over such matters. Zhang Xuan casually takes out a book and flip through it.Around an hour later, the 1000 cultivation technique secret manuals have been browsed through and the Library of Heaven's Path has compiled corresponding books to the secret manuals.After receiving what he wants, Zhang Xuan smiles faintly and bids Elder Mo farewell before walking into the distance.Seeing how he is randomly flipping and viewing the books, not even stopping in the midst of it, Elder Mo can't help but chastise him yet again in his mind.Returning back to his living quarters, Zhang Xuan follows what he did previously and searches for the correct phrases and paragraphs within the thousand books.As he expected, not too long later, the library compiles the thousand books into a single one. This time, the book isn't nameless and the four big words \u300aHeaven's Path Divine Art\u300b is written on it.He starts to cultivate again.Fighter 5-dan Dingli realm is an extension of the Pigu realm. The purpose of this realm is simple, it is to temper the zhenqi of the cultivator to his body. The difference in strength between each stage in Dingli realm is mainly due to the level of compatibility between one's zhenqi and their body.The greater their compatibility, the more strength one is able to exert.Reading the cultivation method for the Dingli realm in the Heaven's Path Divine Art, Zhang Xuan focuses his attention. He carefully controls the crystal clear zhenqi in his dantian to slowly flow in his body, going at a fixed rhythm to allow it to merge completely with his body.The Heaven's Path Divine Art is indeed worthy of being a cultivation technique compiled by the advantages of over a few thousand secret manuals. The efficiency of the cultivation method is indeed one to behold. His zhenqi and muscles swiftly merge together as one.The strength of his body and the compatibility of his zhenqi soars up exponentially.Dingli realm primary stage!Dingli realm intermediate stage!Dingli realm advanced stage!Dingli realm pinnacle!Boom!After four hours, his body jolts again.Zhang Xuan reopens his eyes. His eyes are filled with disbelief, \u201cThis\u2026 Fighter 5-dan pinnacle?\u201dInitially, he thought he would take a long period cultivating in 5-dan. Never in his dreams would he possibly imagine that he could reach the pinnacle in four hours through the Heaven's Path Divine Art.To his previous self, cultivation is as difficult as trying to ascend the heavens. Yet, to Zhang Xuan who is practicing the Heaven's Path Divine Art, it is as easy as eating and drinking.Just by half a night worth of effort, he rose from Fighter 3-dan Zhenqi realm to Fighter 5-dan Dingli realm pinnacle\u2026 This is too exaggerated!Furthermore, if it wasn't for the fact that he didn't know the cultivation method for 6-dan, unaware of which acupoint he should breakthrough, he might have already successfully broken through to become a 6-dan Pixue realm expert!In 6-dan Pixue realm, one opens up all of the blocked acupoints in their body. For every acupoint broken through, one's zhenqi would become richer and one's prowess will rise.It is said that there are 108 acupoints in the human body. However, only 72 of these can be opened and there is an order to opening it. Everyone's body is different, thus everyone would require a different sequence in breaking through each of them to obtain the best results out of it. If one is unable to find the correct sequence, they could very possibly end up only opening three to four acupoints and be stuck there for the rest of their lives.This is just like cleaning the silt by a river. It has to be cleaned gradually from the upper stream to the lower stream. If one were to start at the center and clean towards the upper and lower stream, not only will the river not be cleaned thoroughly, it might even result in a blockage, causing one to be unable to progress further.The same logic goes for breaking through one's acupoints as well. If one doesn't find the ideal sequence, the other acupoints might get blocked and for the rest of their lives, they would be unable to open it.Thus, without a cultivation technique, Zhang Xuan doesn't dare to try to cultivate further.However, he isn't anxious. It is already unheard of to break through two great realms in a single night. He is already very satisfied with the results.\u201cUnless required, it is best for me to not to reveal my level of cultivation!\u201dAs a transcender, he has read many books and watched many shows. He knows that possessing a treasure itself is a crime.He is the worst teacher in the entire academy. Yet, in a night, he suddenly gains the strength of a Fighter 5-dan pinnacle. If others were to find out, won't they all rush to him?Thus, it is best for him to not tell anyone about him reaching Dingli realm pinnacle. The more confidential it is, the better it is for him.\u201cLet me see how much strength would I hold this time!\u201dAfter making a decision, Zhang Xuan walks over to the Strength Measuring Rock Pillar.While other people only possess one ding of strength in their Dingli primary stage, he possessed five ding. If so, how much strength would he hold now that he has reached the pinnacle?Peng!Light flows through the rock pillar and numbers appear on it.8 ding!\u201cEight ding of strength? That is almost the strength of a Pixue realm expert who has opened up four acupoints!\u201d Zhang Xuan's eyes lit up.A normal Dingli pinnacle cultivator would possess four ding of strength. After which, for each acupoint they break through, their strength would increase by one ding.Despite just being at Dingli pinnacle, he possesses the strength of eight ding, putting him on the same level as an expert who has broken through four acupoints.\u201cAs expected of the Heaven's Path Divine Art, incredible!\u201dZhang Xuan is quite happy. After training for such a long period of time, he intends to find something to eat then go to sleep. However, his ears suddenly twitch.\u201cWhy would someone be here at such a time?\u201dZhang Xuan frowns.Due to an advancement in his cultivation, his hearing and sight have improved tremendously. He is able to clearly perceive the sound of someone hiding somewhere not too far from where he is, staring fixedly at his living quarters.\u201cLooks like he is surveying my room. He probably has yet to detect my presence!\u201dAt this moment, Zhang Xuan isn't at his room but behind a Strength Measuring Rock Pillar which is a distance away from the dormitory. After measuring his strength, he has been suppressing his breathing, thus the other party has yet to notice his presence.\u201cLet's see who's the one finding trouble with me!\u201dHe didn't expect that someone would want to deal with him right after he is done cultivating. The doubts in his mind grow.Rummaging through the memories of his previous self, although he doesn't have much accomplishment, there hasn't been a scenario where someone sneaked onto in the night to deal with him!\u201cNo matter who he is, I mustn't let him identify me!\u201dJust when he was about to meet the other party, a thought suddenly flashes through his mind.The entire academy knows that he is a Fighter 3-dan Zhenqi realm trash. If he were to appear at this moment as a 5-dan pinnacle, the other party would definitely be scared to death!Furthermore, if the news were to spread out, there would surely be quite a few person who would look into him.Thus, no matter who the other party is, Zhang Xuan mustn't allow him to identify him.At this moment, he suddenly recalls the numerous movies he has watched back in his previous life. Thus, he tears away a fabric from his sleeves and covers his face.Hu!After finishing with his preparations, making use of the darkness of the night, Zhang Xuan gradually creeps towards the other party with light footsteps.Although he has just broken through and he has never studied any footwork, the cultivation technique he is training with is the Heaven's Path Divine Art which grants him superb control over his body. Not to mention, he is also very familiar with his surroundings, so the other party didn't notice him even when he is just ten meters behind him.At such a proximity, he could clearly see the black suit donned by the other party. His face is also covered, so it is impossible for him to make out his identity as well.\u201cLad, if you must blame, blame it for your daring guts to dare to lay your hands on our young mistress!\u201dHiding behind a large tree, Zhang Xuan stares at the silhouette before him as the mutterings of the latter vaguely drift to his ears.\u201cThat voice sounds familiar\u2026\u201dZhang Xuan's eyebrows knit tightly together.Zhang Xuan is sure that he had heard this voice before. However, he has difficulty recalling exactly when and where he heard it.Hu!Just as he is trying his best to recall whether it is the memory of his previous self or after he has transcended, the silhouette before him flickers and gradually moves towards his dormitory. At the same time, with a flick of his wrist, a cold gleam shines and a sharp dagger appears on his palm.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18: ScammedTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"You want to kill me?\"Seeing the other party whipping out a knife, Zhang Xuan raise his eyebrows.It is fortunate that he has been cultivating and not sleeping. Otherwise, when the other party approaches him silently like this, won't he be killed for sure?\"Let me first ascertain who this fellow is!\"Zhang Xuan knows that conducting this kind of night assault would mean that he is not an individual. Perhaps, there could even be an organization behind him. If he doesn't accurately identify the one trying to murder him, even if he were to kill this assassin, there might be more coming for his life in the future. If he doesn't dig out the organization behind the assassination, he wouldn't have to dream of sleeping peacefully anymore.\"Who is it?\"Just when Zhang Xuan is pondering how he should force the man before him to confess the organization backing him, he hears a hushed voice. Unknowingly, the black-clothed man grasping the dagger is already standing at proximity to him.Zhang Xuan has never tracked anyone before. Upon seeing the other party whip out a dagger, he got nervous for a moment and leaked out his breath, causing the other party to notice his presence.\"I...\"To be noticed so quickly, Zhang Xuan frowns. Just when he is about to rush forward to duel with the man before him, a thought flash through his mind and a brilliant idea pops out.\"I am here to kill Zhang Xuan, that useless teacher! Who are you?\"Suppressing his tone so as to not be identified, Zhang Xuan declares.Since the other party is here to kill him, he would be able to confuse him by saying that he is here for the same purpose.\"You're here to kill him?\" The black-clothed man is taken aback. However, looking at how Zhang Xuan conceals his face and his sneaky attitude, he couldn't help but trust his words slightly.\"Indeed. The academy's worst teacher will only bring harm to the students if left alone!\" Zhang Xuan couldn't help but turn red upon talking about himself.\"Oh, then you do it. I will help you keep a look out!\" The black-clothed man says.\"Keng?\" A uncomprehending look appears on Zhang Xuan. He tries to push the responsibility to him, \"I think it would be better for you to do it. Anyway, we are here for the same motive, so it doesn't matter who does it!\"\"You do it. Actually, I have no intentions of killing him. I only wanted to punish him. However, if he were to die, that would be for the best!\" The black-clothed man urges him on.\"Punish him?\"Zhang Xuan is a little confused. Punish him... Then why is he holding a dagger? He couldn't resist asking, \"How do you want to punish him?\"\"Hmph, that fellow dares to do something disrespectful to our young mistress. I intend to chop off his thing and turn him into a eunuch!\"The black-clothed man proclaims furiously.\"...\" Hearing those words filled with vile intentions, Zhang Xuan could only feel a breeze at his crotch and shivered unconsciously in fear.The hell! If I were to sleep peacefully tonight, I would probably be qualified to serve the emperor after this!****!Who the hell are you, for you to be so vicious!Disrespectful to your young mistress?Zhang Xuan tries to recall the memories of his previous self and after his reincarnation, but he doesn't seem to have gotten into any physical relationships with any young mistresses!\"That Zhang Xuan, I have only heard that he is unqualified as a teacher, I have never heard of him bullying females. What is this about?\" Zhang Xuan couldn't resist asking.\"Hmph, that fellow is an animal with a human skin! What teacher, he is a beast! Our young mistress... Forget it, the more I think about it, the more furious I get!\" Untold rage could be felt from the suppressed voice of the black-clothed man.\"...\" Zhang Xuan could only see stars.So what the hell is it about, for you to insult me as a beast? What did I do to your young mistress? Besides that, who the hell is your young mistress? It is one thing if she is pretty, but if she is ugly, isn't it too much for such a reputation to be forced on me!\"Why do you want to kill him?\"After his insults, the black-clothed man looks over.\"Me?\" Zhang Xuan didn't expect that the other party would question him. He is stunned for a moment before clenching his jaw and answering, \"I... I can't accept his actions of bullying women!\"\"You know that he bullies woman? Who did he bully?\" The black-clothed man is alarmed.\"He...\" Zhang Xuan harrumphs and says, \"There is no reason for me to answer your questions!\"\"That is true. Since we both have the same goals in mind, you go first!\" Seeing that the other party is unwilling to reveal anything, although there are doubts in his mind, he chooses to ask no further and waves his hand to gesture Zhang Xuan to go ahead.\"It would be better if you go first! If I were to strike first, he would be dead before you can castrate him. It would be better for you to castrate him first before I kill him!\" Zhang Xuan replies.\"That...\" The black-clothed man starts to hesitate. He looks at Zhang Xuan in doubt.He has started to get suspicious.How could it be possible for such a coincidence to occur? Just when he intends to castrate Zhang Xuan, another person appears to assassinate him? If it wasn't for his fear of the strength of the other party, he would have struck him unconscious by now.\"Why? You don't trust me? If I don't want to kill him, why would I sneak here in the middle of the night!\" Noticing his doubts, Zhang Xuan tries to dispel them.\"Un!\"Hearing those words, the black-clothed man hesitates for a moment before nodding his head in agreement.That's true. It is already late at night. If the masked man isn't here to kill Zhang Xuan, why would he be here for?\"It isn't because I don't trust you. Since our goals align with one another, let's go together!\" The black-clothed man replies after pondering for a moment.He is still a little suspicious of the fellow in front of him.\"You are still way too careful. Rest easy, I have basic principles as a human. However, since you do not trust me...\" Zhang Xuan doesn't drag on the conversation and gestures, \"Let's go together!\"After which, he charges forward.\"Fighter 5-dan pinnacle?\" Seeing his movement, the black-clothed man instantly identifies his level of cultivation. He exerts his qinggong and follows closely behind.Seeing the black-clothed man following behind him, Zhang Xuan immediately turns around to take a look.Boom!The Library of Heaven's Path jolts and a book appears.The skill the other party exerted to follow him is equal to executing a battle technique. As long as one were to use a skill, the Library of Heaven's Path would be able to compile a book on his flaws and thus, his background would be revealed.Zhang Xuan glances at the book.He only sees two words 'Yao Han' written on the cover.\"This name sounds so familiar... Where have I heard of it?\" Zhang Xuan stares at the front cover for a moment before flipping over to the first page.\"Yao Han, the butler of Baiyu City Lord Residence. Fighter 6-dan Pixue primary stage, eight acupoints opened!\"...\"It's him?\"Seeing the words Baiyu City, Zhang Xuan immediately recalls the identity of the man before him.Isn't this the butler from Baiyu City who rushed over to threaten him when he accepted Zhao Ya as his student?No wonder his voice and name sounds so familiar!Just that...This means that the young mistress that he mentioned refers to Zhao Ya... What did I do to her for you to make the journey here just to castrate me?\"To dare to malign me... Even though you are stronger than me, I must teach you a lesson!\"The more he thinks about it, the angrier he gets.If it is something his previous self did, since he has transcended over to take his place, even though he would feel wronged, he would admit it. However, the crux is that... he didn't do anything! For Yao Han to label him with this crime when he did nothing, he is simply too vile!As such thoughts race through his mind, he continues to glance through the list.\"Cultivation Technique: White Jade Circulation Technique!\"\"Battle Techniques: Mystical Diagram Palm (Expert), Mystical Diagram Fist (Expert)...\"\"Flaws: 16 aspects. No.1, his mingmen is at his bottoms and his skills are unable to guard against attacks directed at the point... No.2... No.3...\"Just as how it did previously, the book records all the flaws on this fellow.Having broken through eight acupoints, this means his current strength is at 12 ding. If Zhang Xuan were to try to match him in a direct combat, he would definitely not be a match for him.However...\"So what if you are in Pixue realm? So what if you possess 12 ding of strength? If I don't teach you a lesson today, I wouldn't be called Zhang Xuan!\"Hu!At this point, Zhang Xuan stops abruptly.\"What's wrong?\"Seeing Zhang Xuan stopping abruptly, the black-clothed man asks with a confused look.\"Look, an UFO!\"Zhang Xuan casually points.\"UFO? What is an UFO?\"The black-clothed man is taken aback and hurriedly turns around to take a look. This action reveals the mingmen on his bottom to Zhang Xuan.Incomprehension plagues Yao Han. He knows of butterfly, ultimatum and spy. However, what exactly is an 'UFO'?Butterfly -> Hu DieUltimatum -> Tong DieSpy -> Jian DieUFO(Flying saucer) -> Fei DieDie is pronounced as Di-yeh.\"Go to hell!\"What Zhang Xuan has been waiting for is this opportunity. Without any hesitation whatsoever, he sends a kick filled with his wrath towards his bottom.Peng!Before the black-clothed man Yao Han could react, his mingmen is kicked on. He flies forward and crashes head-on with a boulder not too far away. Blood trickles down from the wound on his head.Since you are here to castrate me, should I castrate you right now?The more he thinks about it, the angrier he gets. Zhang Xuan rushes forward and sits on the other party's body. He sends a couple of fists onto his face.What Pixue realm expert, what 12 ding expert? They are strong? If you were to find their mingmen and exploit their flaws, an unexpected assault will still lead to their deaths!\"You...\"Apparently, Yao Han didn't expect the fellow who wanted to teach Zhang Xuan a lesson along with him would suddenly attack him frenziedly. What's worse, his mingmen is struck, causing his entire body to go stiff. He couldn't retaliate even if he wanted to. His body shivers from anger.Didn't we agree to deal with Zhang Xuan together?The heck!Where is your trust?Where are your basic principles as a human?Besides... No matter what, you are a Fighter 5-dan Dingli pinnacle master, an expert among experts. You should have some demeanor even in the midst of a battle. To shamelessly lie to me and launch a secret assault before riding on my face...What about battle techniques?What about crossing blows?What about your cultivation technique?Even gangsters on the street don't fight this way...He only feels wave after wave of pain on his face. Yao Han is about to go insane.At this moment, he finally knows that he have been scammed by the masked man.Furthermore, it is the worst kind of scams.QinggongLiterally translated as the 'Art of Lightweight'. It refers to footwork which allows one to tread lightly, increasing one's jumping ability, running speed and dodging skills.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19: FramingTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexAfter a violent thrashing, Zhang Xuan finally feels the rage in his heart subsiding slightly.Lowering his head to take a look, Yao Han's mask has already fallen off in the midst of the bashing and his face is warped from taking his hits. Probably, even his own mother would be unable to recognize him in his current state.\"Keng...\"Now that anger is no longer clouding his mind, Zhang Xuan immediately grasps his current situation. \"This fellow is the butler of Baiyu City Lord, as well as the uncle of my disciple. It is still okay for me to teach him a lesson, but I should not kill him by any means.\"No matter what, this fellow is still Zhao Ya's Uncle Yao. If Zhang Xuan were to really kill him, won't the disciple he just admitted go to waste?There would surely be zero possibility for reconciliation if that were to happen!Besides, Baiyu City is reputed as the third biggest city in Tianxuan Kingdom. To be able to become the city lord of such a city, Zhao Ya's father should be rather powerful and holds great influence. If his butler was killed and he chooses to pursue this matter, it might be possible for him to investigate onto himself. If so, he would be in deep trouble.Being a newcomer in this world, he has yet to create a firm foothold for him to stand on, so it is best for him to keep a low profile.\"I mustn't let me become suspicious of me!\"The thought flashes through his mind.Since Yao Han cannot be killed, then Zhang Xuan have to let him go alive. For him to get beaten him in the midst of an assault against Zhang Xuan, Zhang Xuan would definitely be the first person he would be suspicious of!\"Oh right, I have the perfect scapegoat for this. If he didn't come looking for trouble today, I wouldn't have thought of him...\"A person flashes through Zhang Xuan's mind.That person is the man who was beside Shen Bi Ru earlier today, the one who kept mocking him, Shang Bin.Anyway, that fellow is the grandson of Elder Shang Chen. If Zhang Xuan were to push the blame to him, Yao Han wouldn't dare to take revenge even if he wanted to!In fact, it would be better if Yao Han were to take revenge! The two of them would then bite viciously onto one another.At this point, Zhang Xuan stares at the distorted face of Yao Han and deepens his voice, \"I have a grudge with Zhang Xuan. Earlier today, he got on my nerves and so, I intended to teach him a lesson in the night! However, if he were to be castrated by you, Bi... she would definitely suspect that I am the one who did it and a misunderstanding would arise between us! Blame this all on the fact that you met me today, as well as your untimely arrival!\"\"...\"Only now did Yao Han know why he was thrashed. He wants to retort, but his mouth is swollen like a pair of sausages, making it impossible for him to talk.\"Scram!\"Seeing that the other party has comprehended his words, Zhang Xuan doesn't continue speaking. He stands up and kicks Yao Han's body a dozen meters away.\"Damn it!\"Hurling vulgarities towards the other party in his mind, Yao Han knows that he is in a disadvantageous situation today. Gritting his teeth, he turns away and leaves.At the same time, he carves the two main characteristics of the attacker onto his mind. Firstly, the person who beat him up had an encounter this Zhang Xuan earlier in the day and was incensed by his words or actions! Secondly, the relationship between him and Zhang Xuan should be love rivals. The woman who they are pursuing has a 'Bi' in her name.As long as he remembers this two distinctive features, it is an easy task for him to find out who the fellow who laid his hands on him is.Only after seeing Yao Han disappear into the distance does Zhang Xuan heave a sigh of relief. He pats away the dirt on his clothes and returns back to the dormitory.This event is a great fright to him. If he didn't stay up to cultivate tonight, it would be hard to tell what would have happened.However, at least the danger is averted temporarily.\"The key to survival in this world... power!\"Sitting on the bed in his dormitory, Zhang Xuan mutters to himself.If his cultivation didn't soar today, even if he knew Yao Han's weaknesses, he wouldn't have been a match for him. The one to suffer in the end will be him.Thus, the urgent matter at hand is for him to swiftly raise his strength. The stronger he is, the better it is!He slowly drifts into the world of dream with his mind filled with sentimentality.The next day, Zhang Xuan wakes up the moment the sky lights up. Although he has barely slept for two hours, not to mention how hard he had worked the previous night, he still feels refreshed without the slightest fatigue.\"Time to start lessons!\"He mutters as he puts on his clothes. After which, he walks to his classroom with large strides.It didn't take long for him to arrive at his classroom. The moment he pushes the door open, a plump youth welcomes him enthusiastically.\"Zhang laoshi, you are here! Look, I have already finished cleaning up the room!\"He is the final student Zhang Xuan accepted yesterday, the fatty Yuan Tao.Zhang Xuan didn't expect that this fellow would be the first to arrive, given how he threatened him yesterday. Furthermore, he even cleaned the classroom spick and span.\"Not bad!\" Zhang Xuan nods his head in approval.\"Hehe, since teacher said that I did not bad, is there any reward for my effort? Like some martial art or cultivation technique and such. You can casually reward me with three or five of them...\"Hearing Zhang Xuan's acknowledgment, a wide smile appears on fatty's face.This fellow is the type who would go too far when you give him some leeway.\"Wait by the side first. I will start the lesson after the other students arrive!\" Zhang Xuan gestures.The first to arrive is fatty. Unexpectedly, the second to arrive is the student whom he won from the bet, Liu Yang!However, Liu Yang's attitude isn't as good as fatty's. Indignation spells on his face as he gazes at Zhang Xuan with a look of contempt.In his opinion, Zhang Xuan only won the bet by luck and it is a torture for a genius like him to come under the tutelage of a teacher of such horrendous standards.The third to arrive is the youth who specializes in the way of the spear, Zheng Yang!After Zhang Xuan pointed out the problem in Zheng Yang's spear, his strength rose by more than a single fold. As a result, Zheng Yang holds great confidence towards his teacher and out of the current few students who acknowledged Zhang Xuan, he is the only one who came to him on his own free will.The fourth to arrive is Wang Ying. The shy lass couldn't help but blush upon catching sight of the other students when she enters and immediately hides at the corner...........................................\"I should be able to solve the problem of my body today...\" Zhao Ya opens her eyes.Yesterday, the academy's worst teacher claimed that he is capable of solving her problem. After returning to her dormitory, she felt lost and worried, causing her to roll about her bed, only falling asleep after a long time later.Regardless of whether the other party is telling the truth or lying, there would surely be a conclusion by the end of today!When such a thought strikes her, she gargles her mouth, puts on her clothes and leaves the room swiftly.As the daughter of Baiyu City Lord and one of the top ten scorers of the entrance examinations, she is granted a personal residence, unlike the shared dormitory of the other students. There are many rooms in the residence and the butler, Uncle Yao, stays in one of the rooms not too far away from hers.\"Uncle Yao, I'm going to class!\"Seeing no movements in the room after shouting, Zhao Ya prepares to walk off.\"Young mistress, wait for me. I will go with you!\" A shout echoes from beyond the door. The door opens and Yao Han walks out.Looking at his face, Zhao Ya is taken aback. \"Uncle Yao, you... What happened?\"Zhao Ya is stunned to see Yao Han's swollen face and the dark rings around his eyes. In a single night, the dignified Yao Han has been disfigured. If it wasn't for the familiar voice, she wouldn't have known who he is!\"Oh, I accidentally hit myself after getting too absorbed in my training yesterday!'Yao Han explains.\"...\"Who would hit themselves in the midst of their training?Is it possible for anyone to find an even worse excuse than that...\"Uncle Yao, what happened? Who did it? No, I have to tell my dad!\" Zhao Ya exclaims furiously.\"Young mistress, don't bother yourself with this. This is my own problem... I can resolve it myself! You better hurry to your class first. I want to see how the teacher you acknowledged is like. If his standards are exactly like what the rumors dictate, I will immediately report this to the city lord and have the Hongtian Academy get a new teacher for you...\"Yao Han waves his hand imposingly. However, as his movements are too big, his wounds are pulled on and cold sweat drenches his back.\"Fine!\"Seeing how adamant Yao Han is against her interference in the matter, Zhao Ya doesn't touch on any further on the subject. The two of them walk towards Zhang Xuan's classroom.\"Uncle Yao, given how severely wounded you are, I think you should go back and rest first. I can attend the lesson by myself, there is no need for you to send me!\"After walking a short distance, Zhao Ya noticed how his entire body is trembling and drenched in sweat, she couldn't help but say these words.Yesterday, Zhang Xuan didn't pull back his blows even in the least. Despite applying medicine on the wounds and resting for a few hours, his wounds are still severe. It is quite incredible that he is even able to walk.\"Young mistress, the city lord has tasked me to find a good teacher for you before we set off. Yet, you had to choose such a fellow. How can I face the city lord in the future!\" Yao Han says. \"No matter what, I want to expose the true face of that fellow before you and prove to you that he is a fraud! Only our pure and innocent young mistress would fall for his tricks. Given those standards of his, it is impossible for him to recruit a second student. When you finally witness that there are no other students in his class, you would know that...\"Jiyaaaa!The door to the classroom is pushed open, revealing its interior.Within the classroom sits Zhang Xuan and his four new students.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Wang Ying's ShockTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexAfter hearing that the young mistress has acknowledged Zhang Xuan as her master, Yao Han rushes here furiously, oblivious to the fact that Zhang Xuan has already accepted several students.He had just let out word that the other party would be unable to recruit a second student other than the young mistress but in the next moment, he meets Wang Ying and the rest. He feels as though he was slapped in the face in public. His face immediately darkens.\"Teacher!\" Zhao Ya also feels a burning sensation on her face and she feels tempted to find a burrow to hide in.\"You are alright?\"A short moment later, Yao Han recovers and stares in confusion at Zhang Xuan.That fellow yesterday was so brutal to him, so he thought that even if Zhang Xuan isn't reduced to a pig head, he would at the very least be crippled. So why... does he seem to be fully intact, to the point of being unable to find even a single scratch on his skin.Actually, even though he said that he wanted to assess Zhang Xuan's standards as a teacher, his true purpose is to see his pathetic state after getting thrashed by the mysterious man... Yet, in the end, as a Fighter 6-dan Pixue realm expert, he went to assault him yet ended up getting beaten up while the one who he intended to assault isn't even wounded in the least... He feels as though he has lost greatly and he finds it unacceptable.\"Why wouldn't I be alright?\" Zhang Xuan knows what Yao Han is thinking but he replies with a stoic expression. He looks towards Zhao Ya and asks, \"This disabled person is...\"\"Disabled person?\" A peculiar expression appears on Zhao Ya's face. Before she could speak, a voice interrupts her.\"You are the one who is disabled!\" Yao Han suppresses the urge to vomit blood. His eyebrows shoot upwards and he flings the sleeves of his robe, \"I am the butler of Baiyu City Lord Residence, Yao Han!\"\"Oh, since you are disabled, you shouldn't be walking around here. Otherwise, if you were to die here, it would be difficult for me to explain!\" As though not hearing his words, Zhang Xuan gestures to the door, \"Send off our guest and shut the door!\"\"You...\"Yao Han clenches his fist furiously and almost exploded on the spot.Who is he?The butler of Baiyu City Lord Residence. He possesses great authority. In the Hongtian Academy, even the executive of the Education Bureau would have to give in to him. Yet, a teacher like Zhang Xuan dares to say that he is disabled and even tries to throw him out. How could it be possible for him to not be angry?\"I want to see how you are going to teach them!\" Putting his hands behind him, Yao Han stands upright proudly.\"Oh, since you know that you have to leave, make it fast. We need to maintain a silent atmosphere when teaching the students, so we don't just allow any cats and dogs in our classrooms!\"Zhang Xuan seems to be on a different frequency as him. As though hearing nothing at all, he gestures towards the exit yet again.\"You... Who are you calling cat and dog?\" The rage burns with him and blood flows out from his wounds. Yao Han trembles uncontrollably, \"Do you think that I wouldn't dare to kill you with a palm of mine right now...\"\"Zhao Ya, send him out so that I can solve your problem!\"Can't be bothered to argue with the other party, Zhang Xuan signals to Zhao Ya.\"Uncle Yao, please... leave for the moment! I am about to start lessons!\"Hearing those words, Zhao Ya's eyes light up.\"I am not leaving. I want this fellow to clarify who he is talking about! I, Yao Han, a Fighter 6-dan Pixue realm expert, is respected wherever I go. Who dares to say that I am crippled, even trying to drive me out...\"Peng!Before he could finish his words, Zhao Ya pushes him out. The next moment, the sight before him turns dark as the door closes on him. If he didn't dodge fast enough, he would have been smacked by the door.\"Young mistress...\"Standing outside the door, Yao Han frowns and his face twitches.If he was driven out by Zhang Xuan, he would surely retaliate. However, since it was the young mistress who drove him out, he wouldn't dare to lay his hands on her even if he was beaten to death. Even so, he directs all the resentment he has accumulated onto Zhang Xuan.He is unable to understand what capabilities the fellow possess, to be capable of deluding the young mistress to such an extent.\"Uncle Yao, I'm sorry to bother you to wait outside. We are going to start lessons!\"Zhao Ya knows about her own problem. Her own illness must not be revealed to anyone, especially to Uncle Yao. If her teacher is going to help her solve her problem, she would naturally have to drive him away.\"Fine, young mistress. I will be waiting outside. If anything happens, call me and I will rush in immediately!\"Hearing the words of the young mistress, Yao Han knows that he would be unable to enter. He is on the verge of erupting but without a choice, he could only grit his teeth and bear with it.After Yao Han leaves, only Zhang Xuan's five newly accepted students and him remain in the room. Zhang Xuan surveys the surrounding, \"Since all of you have acknowledged me as your teacher, you all would be fellow peers. Make sure to take good care of one another so as to not sully my prestige!\"\"Prestige?\"Hearing this word, the five students stare at one another...Teacher, you don't seem to have any prestige?Cough cough, even if we wanted to sully it, there is nothing there to sully...\"My way to teaching is slightly different from the others. I pay particular importance to cater teachings to the student's personal condition. The way to guiding everyone is different! Thus, there is nothing to compare between you all!\" Zhang Xuan seems oblivious to the expressions of his students and puts on the airs of a teacher, \"Right now, I will go to the little room by the side. When I call your name, enter the little room!\"Zhang Xuan's classroom isn't big, around one hundred square meters. Even so, there is a partition in which, the teacher is able to give specific guidance to a student.These five students are different from one another. If he were to guide them together as a whole, it would be troublesome and highly ineffective.\"Wang Ying, you are my first student. Come in!\"After which, Zhang Xuan leads the way into the small room.\"Yes!\" Given Wang Ying's obedient nature, she doesn't dare to retort and walks closely behind him.......................................................Wang Ying feels a little regretful.Yesterday, she got lost and came over to ask for directions. Yet, she was scammed into acknowledging this teacher as her mentor.Initially, she didn't know what was going on but after thinking through it, this teacher doesn't seem to be truly capable.Other teachers are able to tell the problem with her leg through her punching routine. However, not only was this fellow unable to tell, he even bragged about being able to cure the injury on her leg...For this injury, her father even found the most famous of physicians but it was to no avail. Even so, the man before her claims that he is able to treat her. If this isn't a scam, what could this be?\"Furthermore, Liu laoshi told her many things regarding this teacher.Only then did she realize that this teacher had such a 'radiant' background. The first teacher to score a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination and the weakest in terms of strength among the teachers... Why was she so unfortunate to be scammed by him and to believe his words!\"No wonder big brother said that there are many bad guys outside...\"When her elder brother told her that there were untrustworthy people outside, she didn't believe him. Now, looking at the teacher before her, she feels wronged, that she has been lied to.Just as she is thinking about how she should withdraw from the lessons of this teacher, that at most it would simply end with a scolding and she could find her elder brother to help her find another teacher, she hears a familiar voice sounding out.\"Display your battle technique once more!\"Zhang Xuan sits at the center of the room and looks over with a calm expression.The previous time, when he tried to coax Wang Ying into joining him, the Library of Heaven's Path wasn't activated yet, so he still has no idea what flaws do Wang Ying have.\"Alright!\" Although Wang Ying is tempted to withdraw from the lessons, she nods her head after hesitating for a moment. Once again, her fists generate gusts of wind and soon, her punching routine came to an end.\"Un!\"Zhang Xuan nods his head.Although Wang Ying's character may be a little dense, her punching routine is quite satisfactory.\"Teacher, actually I want to...\"Wang Ying wavers for a moment and just when she was about to express her intention to withdraw from Zhang Xuan's lesson, the young man opposite of her speaks.\"If I'm not wrong, your leg was probably struck by someone during a duel two years ago!\" Zhang Xuan says.\"You... How did you know?\" Wang Ying is taken aback. Her words jam in her mouth as her beautiful eyes widen in circles.She only talked about the injury on her leg yesterday, and not the origin of it. She didn't expect the other party to be capable of telling that it is an injury from someone's blow and even the time of the injury. She couldn't help but be shocked.\"There are three acupoints on a person's leg and individually, they govern strength, speed and dexterity. When you battled with someone else, the other party accidentally struck the acupoint which governs strength! When this acupoint is struck, it closes, resulting in your blood to flow in reverse, thus preventing you from exerting strength on it like any other normal person!\"Zhang Xuan states calmly.\"That...\" Wang Ying's body trembles. Her face flushes completely red.For her leg, Wang Ying's father had invited all of the renowned doctors in the kingdom, including the famous Master Yuanyu. He seems to have spoken similar words, but even he was unable to identify where the acupoint which governs strength is, thus he was unable to treat her.If she wants to be treated once and for all, she has to invite a Fighter 8-dan Zongshi realm master who possesses superior zhenqi to treat her. Otherwise, it is impossible for the treatment to succeed!Initially, she thought that this teacher who claimed that he would be able to treat her leg is just trying to coax her to come under his tutelage. Yet, she didn't expect that he would say the exact same words as what Master Yuanyu said, so how could she not be shocked?\"Teacher, are... are you able to treat me?\" Wang Ying couldn't resist asking.\"It is just a small matter!\" Zhang Xuan replies her question blandly.\"A small matter?\" Wang Ying's eyes narrow as her breathing quickens.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Zephyr AcupunctureTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexEven though she had no problem walking normally with her leg injury, she faced great difficulty in her training. It feels as though poison has soaked into her bones. In the past half year, there doesn't seem to be a single day she spent in happiness.Precisely so, she became the current her who is a little fearful towards stranger, as well as reticent.Initially, she thought that her injury would stay with her for her entire life. Yet, she didn't expect that the Zhang Xuan laoshi, whom everyone thought was trash, would say that 'It is a small matter!'. She found it hard to believe what her ears are hearing.If it was a moment ago, she might have thought that Zhang Xuan was simply bragging. However, from the instant he pointed out the reason behind her injury, expectation starts to well up in her.\"The reason why I had you to come into this room individually is to treat you! Alright, relax your entire body!\"Zhang Xuan retrieves a medium-sized jade box from the room and opens it gently. Within it lies numerous silver needles of different length.During the training sessions of a martial artist, it is easy for one to incur injuries. Thus, the academy prepared a kit of such in every single classroom to help to boost blood circulation of the wounded, as well as to temporary ease the injury.\"Yes!\" Wang Ying listens to the voice of the young man which was steadfast, confident but without a trace of arrogant and replies. Somehow, Wang Ying trusts the man before her from the depths of her heart and her tense body relaxes.Sou!Sitting on his original spot without moving, he grabs a silver needle and flicks it over.A soft sound and the silver needle he infused with zhenqi shoots tautly towards Wang Ying and pierces her leg.\"This is... Zephyr Acupuncture?\" Wang Ying widens her eyes as her slim body trembles yet again.Zephyr Acupuncture. It is a method which makes use of a martial artist's control over his strength to control the pathway of the silver needles to pierce the correct spots without coming into contact with the patient's body.In this way, a male physician would be able to apply acupuncture without coming into proximity to a female patient. This way, awkwardness between the two is able to be avoided.Such a method of practicing acupuncture may seem simple, but it is actually incredibly complicated. Firstly, it requires the martial artist to hold absolute control over his strength. If there is a slight imprecision, there is a high possibility that it would result in failure! Furthermore, one's eyes must be sharp. It is difficult to recognise the exact acupoints beneath the patient's clothes. If the physician were to recognise the acupuncture inaccurately, all kind of troubles could happen!Master Yuanyu has once said that one must at least attain the cultivation level of Fighter 5-dan Dingli realm to practice Zephyr Acupuncture!Has the teacher termed as trash in the academy reached such a level?Impossible!Those who have reached Dingli realm are all famous figures in the academy, such as the famous teacher Lu Xun. According to Liu laoshi, Zhang Xuan laoshi is only a Fighter 3-dan Zhenqi realm. There is still a huge way to go before he reaches 5-dan Dingli realm!A Fighter 3-dan Zhenqi realm is capable of executing Zephyr Acupuncture?She finds it unbelievable!Sou sou sou sou!While she is still in a state of disbelief, the young man flicks a few more silver needle towards her.A few gusts of wind whip up and the silver needles pierce into her leg with the exact same depth. This shows that the other party has already reached a rather advanced level of his control over his strength.The silver needle pierces into the flesh of her leg. Just as Wang Ying is about to ask Zhang Xuan how he intends to treat her, his hand slides past the needle and the zhenqi that is contained in the needle activates and probes into her body.\"Ah...\"As the zhenqi enters her body, she feels an tingling sensation in her leg. The acupoint which was sealed previously immediately opens under the surge of the zhenqi.\"This... this... this is superior zhenqi?\"As the tingling sensation spreads across her entire body, Wang Ying clearly 'sees' the look of the zhenqi in her body.Clear like water, deprived of any impurities.This is... the quality that only superior zhenqi would possess!Superior zhenqi?That is something that can only be cultivated if one possesses a god or saint cultivation technique. In the entire Tianxuan Kingdom, it is unheard of for anyone to cultivate superior zhenqi. Yet, to think the lousiest teacher in the academy would possess it? It can't be that I am seeing things...\"Done!\"While she was still overwhelmed by shock, her body relaxes completely and slumps. By then, the silver needles had already been retrieved by the other party.Following which, Wang Ying feels a surge of relaxation in her leg, a comfortable sensation which she has never experienced.After her injury, although she is still able to move normally, her legs feel as though they have been plastered, plagued with a stiff sensation at all times. At this moment, wave after wave of pleasant sensation surges through her leg, as though it has broken through some shackles. Her leg feels incomparably nimble and lively.\"My leg...\"She might be slow-witted, but it is clear to see that the injury on her leg has been cured!\"Teacher, thank...\"Wang Ying's knees slacken and she kneels onto the floor. Her eyes are entirely red.For this day, she has waited for a very long time. In fact, she even felt despair at her situation. Never in her dreams would she imagine that... such a stubborn illness would be cured by the academy's worst teacher!\"It seems that the fact is that... He is a very capable person, just that he maintains a low profile...\"Such a thought pops into her head.If he wasn't intentionally maintaining a low profile, regardless of how his lessons are like, just the fact that he is able to cure her legs means that he is more than capable of building his reputation up in this academy. How else is it possible for him to be the last in the Teacher Qualification Examination?With such a thought in mind, Wang Ying kneels to the floor and acknowledges Zhang Xuan as her teacher from the depths of her heart. All thoughts of withdrawing from his tutelage dispel.\"Un, now that your leg injury has recovered, go out and train properly. If you have any other problems, come over and find me afterward!\" Zhang Xuan gestures and entrusts her with a task, \"By the way, call Liu Yang over!\"\"Yes!\" Wang Ying replies excitedly before walking out of the room.....................................\"I intend to withdraw from his lessons later, are any of you all with me?\"In the classroom, after Liu Yang, Zheng Yang, Zhao Ya and Yuan Tao had introduced themselves to one another, Liu Yang said.To tell the truth, he feels extremely dispirited.Scoring within the top hundred, there are many top teachers who are vying for him. Yet, in the end, due to the bet made between two teachers, he was lost to the worst teacher in the entire academy!The intense feeling of being wronged makes him go into a frenzy.No matter what, I have to withdraw from his lessons today. Even if it means that I have to withdraw from the school... No one will be able to halt my footsteps!\"I... also want to withdraw from his lessons. But if Zhang Xuan laoshi were to be angered, it is hard to tell what he might do!\" Fatty Yuan Tao couldn't resist saying.\"Angry? Hmph, so what if he is angry? What can he do? I don't want to go berserk from his misguidance!\" Liu Yang scoffs.\"Berserk?\" Zheng Yang looks over doubtfully.He only knows that the teacher before him scored badly for the Teacher Qualification Examination, being the last of the lot. He has never heard of the incident of a student going berserk from his guidance.\"Un!\" Liu Yang continues, \"If you don't believe it, just wait and see. When Wang Ying walks out later, her face would surely be awful! She would feel like she has been scammed! I have already long heard of Zhang Xuan laoshi's teaching standards. If he was able to offer proper pointers, he wouldn't have landed in such a state, being viewed in contempt by the other teachers...\"Jiyaaa!Just as they were speaking, the door opens and Wang Ying walks out with an excited look.\"Un?\"Liu Yang is taken aback. Initially, he thought that she would be depressed, yet contrary to his expectations, she is smiling happily.The other few students are also puzzled.That joy comes from the depths of her heart. She must have reaped some great rewards for such an expression to appear.Could it be that the teacher with such a horrible reputation could give proper pointers?To get a student to be so excited in just a single session, as though she has attained some precious treasure, probably even the famous Lu Xun laoshi isn't capable of such a feat!\"Liu Yang, teacher called for you to enter!\" Oblivious to what the others are thinking, Wang Ying informs him before going to one corner to start training.\"Me?\" Liu Yang clenches his jaw. \"I would like to see what pointers you are able to offer me! If you can't offer me any good pointers, I will withdraw from your lessons!\"Muttering silently in his heart, he walks into the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: The Reason Behind Zhao Ya's IllnessTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexLiu Yang might have been guided by Zhang Xuan previously, but he doesn't believe that the latter is capable. Rather, he thought that Zhang Xuan simply got lucky.After all, asking someone to use a different hand to execute a punching routine doesn't involve much skill.Thus, from the depths of his heart, he still looks down on the teacher in front of him.\"Teacher!\"Walking into the room, he cups his hand and bows slightly to Zhang Xuan, although his tone isn't very respectful.\"I have seen you execute your battle techniques before!\"Seemingly oblivious to his disrespect, Zhang Xuan continues, \"To be able to train Soaring Flower Fist to the rookie level and Dragon Inch Fist to the expert level, not bad!\"\"What? You... How did you know that I am trained in... Dragon Inch Fist?\"Hearing those words, Liu Yang who was disregarding Zhang Xuan almost faints from shock.Logically, due to his weak strength, he should have focused on his cultivation technique. Even if he has to learn battle technique, he should have practiced a normal battle technique such as Soaring Flower Fist instead of Dragon Inch Fist!Dragon Inch Fist, being a mortal lower-tier battle technique, is much more formidable than the Soaring Flower Fist!In order to become stronger, he hid the fact that he was practicing this punch routine from his family members!Ever since his Dragon Inch Fist reached rookie level, he has never executed it in front of anyone else. Previously, the battle technique which he showed Zhang Xuan was the Soaring Flower Fist. Yet, Zhang Xuan was able to tell that he practices the Dragon Inch Fist and that it is at the expert level...How could he tell?\"There is shadows of the Dragon Inch Fist in your Soaring Flower Fist!\" Naturally, Zhang Xuan can't possibly reveal that it is due to the Library of Heaven's Path. He didn't even blink when telling an outright lie.\"You can even tell from that...\" Liu Yang is still in a state of disbelief.The two skills aren't even in the slightest related to one another. Previously, he also executed the Soaring Flower Fist in front of Cao Xiong laoshi but he wasn't able to tell that much from it. Yet, the academy's worst teacher is able to see through it with one glance. Is this for real?While he is still holding doubts in his heart, the teacher sitting before him continues.\"Reaching the level of an expert, your Dragon Inch Fist holds considerable might. However, do you feel an ache under your armpits and an itch in your jianjin acupoint whenever you execute it?\"TL: Jianjin -> Shoulder well acupoint, right beside the back of your neck on your shoulder.\"This, this...\"Taking a few steps back, Liu Yang looks as though he has seen a ghost, fear appearing within his eyes.Not only are the words of the other party correct, they are exactly spot-on!It is as though he has seen him training.\"You... How did you know?\" Liu Yang couldn't help but ask with a pale face.\"It is very simple, you have been practicing an inappropriate battle technique! If you continue training at this rate, I can guarantee that the muscles of your entire arm will be destroyed within three years. Even immortals will find it hard to save you! In fact, the effects are already apparent now. Do you feel your body going stiff when you are sleeping at night, sometimes even spasming?\"Zhang Xuan questions.\"I...\"Liu Yang trembles.Indeed, he has such a condition. Just that, he thought it was due to over exhaustion from excessive training, so he didn't pay it much heed. Never in his dreams would imagine that it was due to him practicing the Dragon Inch Fist!\"Dragon Inch Fist, it is a skill which regards one's body like a dragon and emphasizes the concept of might in every inch of your body. If you had reached Fighter 4-dan Pigu realm and had zhenqi nourish your muscles, there won't be any side effects from cultivating this battle technique. However, you are only in Juxi realm and your body is far too weak! Forcefully cultivating this battle technique will only cause your body to be injured. As time passes, the injury will only worsen! This is also the reason why although you aren't left-handed, your left hand possess significantly greater strength than your right hand! That is because you practiced the Dragon Inch Fist with your right, causing great damage to it. If you don't stop now, you will become crippled!\"Zhang Xuan warns.\"Teacher, save me...\"At this moment, Liu Yang no longer possesses the arrogance he had when he first walked in. His knees weaken and he kneels to the floor.At this moment, he understands that the teacher before him is definitely an expert, a master among experts!That is because everything Zhang Xuan said fits perfectly with what is happening to him. If Zhang Xuan didn't voice it out, Liu Yang wouldn't have paid much attention to it. However, now that he has stated all of it out clearly and logically, Liu Yang immediately understands that everything he said is true.In the face of such an expert, what rights does he have to remain arrogant?It is laughable that he thought that he felt wronged for acknowledging him as his teacher...Only now does he realize how fortunate he is!Before acknowledging Cao Xiong, he has also met quite a few notable teachers in the academy and displayed his battle technique before them. However, they were unable to tell that he is trained in the Dragon Inch Fist, needless to say, seeing through the fact that his right arm is injured!\"First, stop training in the Dragon Inch Fist and try your best to raise your cultivation. As for the injury that you have sustained and accumulated, I will think of an idea to solve it!\" Zhang Xuan declares. \"Alright, call Zhao Ya in!\"\"Yes!\" Liu Yang nods his head hurriedly. Not daring to say anything further, he quickly walks out.The moment he walks out, he sees Zheng Yang, Zhao Ya and Yuan Tao staring at him.\"Have you withdrawn from Zhang Xuan laoshi's tutelage?\" Yuan Tao asks in agitation.\"Withdraw? Why should I withdraw?\" Liu Yang waves his hand and declares proudly, his face not turning red in the slightest. \"He who teaches me for one day is my father for life. I, Liu Yang, will not withdraw from Zhang Xuan laoshi's lessons. What kind of people do you think I am? Do I look like that casual a person? I really don't know what you all are thinking, to be thinking about withdrawing all day along. Aren't you all embarrassed?\"\"...\" Zheng Yang, Zhao Ya and Yuan Tao.Shameless. He is too shameless!Just a moment ago, he is still going on about how determined he is to withdraw from Zhang Xuan's lessons. Yet, in the blink of an eye, he changed his words entirely. Exactly how thick is his skin?!......\"That teacher is probably... truly capable!\" Seeing the vastly different attitudes between the two when they went in and came out, Zhao Ya thinks in her mind as she pushes the door open.Actually, after hearing Uncle Yao Han's words, it isn't like she never wavered in her determination. However, the truth still stands that the other party was able to point out her 'illness' accurately, giving her hope for a cure.After all, she is too embarrassed to speak of this illness in front of others, so it is impossible for her to reveal it to too many people.\"Sit down!\"Upon walking into the room, she sees Zhang laoshi and sits down.\"Teacher, you said that... you can cure my illness...\" Zhao Ya reddens.\"Un!\" Zhang Xuan nods his head. \"Your illness is an easy problem...\"Actually, it isn't very difficult to solve Zhao Ya's problem. She isn't really sick but rather, she possesses the Pure Yin Body, a physical body which countless women desire. The yin energy in her body is overpowering and if it is directed correctly, her cultivation would soar rapidly!However, it is a pity that no one in Baiyu City noticed it and even chose a yin-nature cultivation technique for her!For the other females, it is indeed quite a good manual to cultivate. However, for Zhao Ya, who possesses a Pure Yin Body, to cultivate such a cultivation technique, it is simply worsening the situation for her.The yin energy in her body accumulates gradually over time. When she was younger, it was still undetectable. However, as her body develops, the unique traits of a female becomes apparent and she would start to find it hard to suppress her urges. If she isn't cured in time and continues on this way, she might become a being possessed by her lust and find it hard to satisfy his desires no matter how hard she tries.This is precisely the reason why such an awkward situation is occurring in her.\"This...\" Zhao Ya is taken aback.She didn't know that she possesses a Pure Yin Body. In fact, even her father is oblivious to the fact.However, the part about her cultivating a pure yin cultivation technique is true!Is this really the cause?\"White Jade Pure Maiden Skill, it is an impressive skill, but it isn't suited for you. If you want to solve this problem at its roots, you have to find another new cultivation technique!\" After explaining the situation, Zhang Xuan states.\"You... How did you know that I cultivate the White Jade Pure Maiden Skill?\" Zhao Ya is taken aback.This cultivation technique has been passed down in the Baiyu City. Other than the Bai family, there are very few people who are aware of it. Even the butler Yao Han, who is at the entrance of the classroom now, isn't too sure about it. Yet, the teacher before her is able to point it out instantly. Zhao Ya is in a state of disbelief.\"If I am capable of seeing through illness, naturally, I would be able to see through your cultivation technique as well!\" Zhang Xuan tilts his head forty-five degree as he assumes the look of an expert whose depth cannot be seen.\"Cultivating a new cultivation technique can solve the problem? Then... What kind of cultivation technique should I cultivate?\" Suppressing the astonishment in her mind forcefully, Zhao Ya asks.\"You should find a cultivation technique capable of unleashing the potential of your body, and not one that accumulates yin energy! How about this, I will go to the academy's Compendium Pavilion to take a look for you to see if there are any suitable ones for you!\"Zhang Xuan says.\"Thank you, teacher!\" Zhao Ya nods her head hurriedly.The problem hasn't been solved yet, but at the very least, she is aware of the cause now. A surge of exhilaration gushes through her heart.\"Un!\" Zhang Xuan waves his hands to show that it is a small matter. \"Call Zheng Yang in!\"While Zhang Xuan is providing pointers to his students in the room, outside the classroom, a tall youth walks over in widened strides.\"Elder Liu, is what you said true?\"As the tall youth walks, he questions the elderly following him behind.\"Young master, that is the truth. Young mistress has acknowledged Zhang Xuan as her master!\"Old Liu nods his head quickly.If Zhang Xuan was here, he would definitely be able to recognize that the Old Liu here is the person who tried to withdraw Wang Ying from his lessons yesterday.The person who he calls young master should be Wang Ying's elder brother, the genius of Hongtian Academy, the disciple of an elder, Wang Tao!\"Zhang Xuan? The teacher who scored a zero for his Teacher Qualification Examination? What rights does he have to teach my younger sister? Damn it! If I don't teach him a lesson today to let him know the price for deceiving my younger sister, I will not call myself Wang Tao!\"As Wang Tao walks towards the classroom, he declares furiously.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: TroublemakerTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexTianxuan City is the capital of Tianxuan Kingdom. To be capable of becoming one of the four great families of the city, the prowess of the Wang family is one to behold.Even the principal of the Hongtian Academy would have to spare some face for such a powerful family. To think that of all teachers, Wang Ying would choose to acknowledge a fellow who has scored zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination. That is an insult!A massive insult!Even though other people might not be aware of the affairs shrouding Zhang Xuan, as a student of the academy, Wang Tao has heard a lot about him. He has once misguided a student, causing his cultivation to go berserk, thus sullying the reputation of the teachers!This person is the topic of discussion and target of mockery over a meal or tea with his peers. Yet, never in his imaginations would he expect his younger sister to choose to acknowledge him as her teacher!If the other students were to be informed of it, won't he become a laughingstock?The more he thinks about it, the more angry Wang Tao becomes. He walks towards the entrance of the classroom and spots Yao Han, who is wrapped like a mummy.\"I see, it is young master Wang Tao!\"As the butler of Baiyu City Lord Residence, Yao Han had come into contact with many different powers. Given that Wang Tao is a talented genius and the son of the head of the Wang family, it is natural for Yao Han to be aware of his existence.\"You are...\" Glancing at him, Wang Tao's eyebrows shoot up.After getting beaten up so savagely, not a single hint of his original appearance remains. Even Zhao Ya finds it hard to recognize him in his current state, needless to say, Wang Tao.\"I am Yao Han from Baiyu City!\" Yao Han says.\"Oh, so you are butler Yao. Why are you...\" Wang Tao is slightly taken aback.\"I accidentally injured myself in the midst of training...\" Yao Han explains awkwardly before changing the topic, \"May I ask what young master Wang Tao is here for?\"\"My younger sister has acknowledged Zhang Xuan as her teacher. I am here to take her back, as well as to teach the arrogant teacher a lesson!\" Wang Tao doesn't even try to conceal his rage.\"Ah? Your younger sister? You mean Wang Ying xiaojie?\"TL: Xiaojie -> MissYao Han was driven out of the classroom right shortly after he entered it. Furthermore, his attention was focused on Zhang Xuan the whole time, thus, he didn't notice Wang Ying's presence.Wang Tao nods his head.\"I have heard that Wang Ying xiaojie's talent is in no way inferior to yours. Why would she choose him?\" Yao Han is puzzled.\"My younger sister rarely comes into contact with the outside world and has an innocent personality. That fellow has a glib tongue and I'm not sure what the fellow said, but my younger sister actually believed the nonsense he spouted!\" Recalling what Old Liu told him, fury flares from Wang Tao.\"How vile! That fellow is a scourge, the scum among the teachers!\" Upon recalling how the young mistress of his family has fallen for his deception as well, he grits his teeth angrily, \"Young master Wang Tao, you have to teach that fellow a lesson!\"\"Un!\" Wang Tao replies. At the same time, he stares at him doubtfully, \"Right, butler Yao, why are you here?\"\"Let's not talk about it. The more I talk about it, the angrier I get. Our young mistress had also fallen for the deceitful words of Zhang Xuan and acknowledged him as her teacher!\" Yao Han scoffs.\"You mean Zhao Ya xiaojie?\" Wang Tao is taken aback.\"Yes!\" Yao Han nods his head.\"Then... why don't you barge in and expose that hypocritical fellow? Why are you waiting at the entrance instead?\" Wang Tao is bewildered.\"I wanted to expose that fellow, but our young mistress got agitated. I had no choice but to wait outside. Young master Wang Tao, you came at a perfect timing. If you were to go in now, teach that shameless fellow a lesson and expose his ugly intentions, our young mistress would be able to see his true colors!\"Yao Han says.\"Rest assured, I will be exposing his fraud now. I will make sure that shameless fellow reveals his despicable self!\"Wang Tao grits his teeth and nods his head. Then, he kicks the door open and walks in with widened strides.....................................On the other hand, Zhang Xuan has finally gone through the individual situations of his five students with them.There are quite a few flaws with Zheng Yang's spear. Zhang Xuan elaborated on them slightly, causing Zheng Yang's strength to soar once again and the latter rejoiced over his improvement.On the other hand, Yuan Tao has never cultivated a proper cultivation technique or battle technique. Zhang Xuan took out the academy's basic Hongtian Nine Dan Formula's 1-dan formula and modified it slightly before passing it to him.He didn't modify much of it, so there is still a large gap between it and the Heaven's Path Divine Art that he is currently cultivating with. Even so, it is still several times more effective than the original Hongtian Nine Dan Formula. With just one look, Yuan Tao almost leaps up from the joy rushing through him, overjoyed to realize that he has acknowledged an accomplished teacher.\"Alright, I have roughly gone through the problems you all have on you. You all need to persevere in your training...\"Returning back to the classroom, Zhang Xuan gathered all five of his students together and was explaining the situation to them when boom, the door to the classroom is kicked open. Following which, a furious howl echoes in the room, \"Zhang Xuan, withdraw my younger sister and Zhao Ya xiaojie from your lessons right now. Otherwise, I will make you will suffer!\"Following which, Wang Tao rushes in and stands furiously before Zhang Xuan. His eyes are dyed crimson red, as though he is ready to murder someone.\"Big brother...\"Seeing her elder brother in such a state, Wang Ying is shocked and immediately rushes forward.\"Don't interfere in this!\" He pushes his younger sister to his back before staring coldly at Zhang Xuan. With a haughty expression, he says, \"Zhang Xuan, it is one thing if you use your nonsense to deceive others, but to think that you would dare to coax my younger sister with lies. You are seeking death! I will give you ten seconds. If you withdraw my younger sister and Zhao Ya xiaojie from your tutelage now, I can let this slip. If not, even if you are a teacher, don't blame me for not going easy on you!\"Boom!With a scornful look, Wang Tao releases his full strength, revealing a very powerful aura.He had reached the level of a Fighter 4-dan Pigu realm!No wonder he could become a disciple of an elder. This strength is in no way weaker than an average teacher of the academy.\"I am conducting lessons right now, get out!\" Zhang Xuan looks at him blandly.\"Conducting lessons? With your standard, what could you possibly be teaching!\" Wang Tao mocks him coldly. \"Get out? You want me to get out? Who do you think you are? The only reason why I call you a teacher is out of basic respect. Look at how you are, are you not aware of it? You are only a lowly teacher who is still in zhenqi realm, don't act like you are a big shot before me. Even if I were to beat you up today, the most that would happen is a reprimand by the elders. What could you possibly do to me?\"He isn't wrong. There are quite a few disciples of the elders in the academy who are stronger than the teachers and hold esteemed positions in the academy. Even if a conflict were to break out between them and the teachers, the most they would do is to reprimand them slightly, there won't be any severe punishments.\"Big brother...\" Wang Ying's face pales.She is very aware of the fact whether the teacher before her has standards or not. When all of the expert physicians in the entire Tianxuan Kingdom could do nothing about her problem, he was able to solve it casually. How could such a person possibly have no standards at all?Just as he was about to stop that rash elder brother of hers, the face of her teacher darkens and his eyes narrow.\"Scram!\"\"To ask me to scram...\" He didn't expect that the trash of a teacher would get him to scram. Just as he is about to continue speaking, he catches a glimpse of the cold gaze of the other party.Looking into his eyes, Wang Tao shivers uncontrollably, as though he is a rabbit who had caught the gaze of a tiger. Under the oppression of a powerful aura, he retreats a few steps subconsciously and his legs tremble.He has only felt such sharp aura from his master. How could it possibly appear on the academy's worst teacher, a fellow who is just Fighter 3-dan Zhenqi realm?It took a moment before Wang Tao regains his composure. In that instant, Wang Tao's face darkens like an ant's nest as his eyes took on a deep shade of red.In his eyes, even though Zhang Xuan is a teacher, he is not any more than a trash. Yet, this trash dares to shout at him and cause him to retreat out of fear. If this were to spread out... How could he possibly face any other people? How would he be able to maintain his prestige?\"You are courting death!\"Feeling humiliated, Wang Tao roars and with a flick of his hand, the sword on his waist has been drawn.Hu!The sword stabs out in a flash.Pah pah pah!At Fighter 4-dan Pigu realm, one would possess strength beyond 500kg. Even before the sword reaches him, the continuous sound generated from the friction between the sword and the wind creates an oppressing atmosphere, as though it would be impossible to counter the attack.\"Zhang laoshi...\"Seeing her elder brother striking out with such speed, Wang Ying's face turns ghastly white.Although she is impressed by the guidance of Zhang laoshi, she is well aware of the fact that the teacher before her is only at Fighter 3-dan. He is far from a match for her brother!It is impossible for him to dodge the blow, he would definitely be injured!Frightened, she shrieks in fear and closes her eyes subconsciously.\"How... How could this be possible?\"Just when she thought that the Zhang laoshi who just resolved her problem for her would be wounded by the sword, she hears voices of disbelief from Zhao Ya and the others. She quickly opens her eyes to take a look and her eyeballs almost popped out from their sockets. She petrifies on the spot.She sees her elder brother's incomparably powerful and mighty slash getting stopped in midair and what is stopping it is the two seemingly weak fingers of Zhang Xuan laoshi.To block such a powerful blow with just... the pinching of two fingers!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Throw Him OutTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Impossible...\"Wang Tao is also in a state of disbelief.Before he came, he had made sure to look into Zhang Xuan's strength. Back then, the information he got was that he was only Fighter 3-dan Zhenqi realm, a weakling!How could he possibly stop his attack with just two fingers?In order to achieve such a feat, not only must one possess sufficient strength, he must also be precise in his timing, control over his strength, his positioning and many other factors. If there were to be a slight discrepancy in his judgment, it is possible for his fingers to be severed and he would be severely injured!The other teachers, or perhaps even the Pixue realm elders, would be unable to achieve such a feat! Yet, a fellow who is reputed to be trash...Impossible!\"Coincidence! It must be a coincidence!\"Such a thought pops into his mind. A savage look appears on Wang Tao's face once more and exerting strength through his both hands, he howls, \"Let go!\"He wants to retrieve his sword that is trapped between the two fingers of Zhang Xuan.However, despite trying twice consecutively, to the point that veins are popping out on his temple and that he is about to vomit blood due to overexertion of strength, he is astonished to realize that the sword that is held between the Zhang Xuan's fingers seems to be firmly latched onto his fingers. No matter how much strength he exerts, it doesn't budge in any way.\"Could it be... his true strength isn't Zhenqi realm?\" A peculiar thought appears in his mind.But this is impossible!It hasn't been long since the last Teacher Qualification Examination. Everyone in the academy is aware of the fact that he only has the strength of a Zhenqi realm pinnacle... Furthermore, even if he were to break through his current realm, he would only be at Pigu realm, which is the same level as him. He wouldn't be so hard-pressed just by a mere two fingers of the other party!\"Scram!'Just as Wang Tao is considering the peculiarity of the situation, a surge of might suddenly comes rushing towards him through the sword and the impassive words of the other party echoes by his ear.Hu!Before he could even react, his entire body is sent flying through the air.Boom!His head bashes through the door of the classroom.\"Alright, let's continue on with our lessons!\"After casually throwing Wang Tao out, Zhang Xuan turns towards the rest and says blandly.\"...\"Wang Ying, Zhao Ya, Liu Yang, Zheng Yang and Yuan Tao stare at one another. The turn of events left them unable to react and they are on the verge of exploding due to the overwhelming shock.That is a Fighter 4-dan Pigu realm expert! Not mentioning how an attack of his full strength was easily dealt with, to think he would be thrown out with such ease...Isn't this teacher of theirs the worst teacher with the lowest combat ability in the entire academy?How did he do it?\"Teacher... has been hiding his strength?\"Suddenly, Zhao Ya comes to a realization as her face flushes from excitement.The only viable explanation is that the teacher before her has been concealing his true strength!If not, how could he possibly point out the problems whom no one else could discern and boost their might with just a casual pointer?The others aren't fools as well. They clench their fist in agitation.Coming to the academy to come under the tutelage of the teachers, who wouldn't hope to be under the guidance of a capable teacher?Before this, everyone thought that their lives would be miserable, judging from how they came under the tutelage of the academy's worst teacher. Only now do they know that... they have won in the competition of choosing one's teachers, an overwhelming one at it!The teacher with the worst reputation in the academy is actually a... true worldly expert!\"Un!\"When their path of thoughts reaches this point, all of the excessive thoughts disappear from their minds as they nod their head vigorously. Even Liu Yang, who held doubts about Zhang Xuan's lessons, couldn't help but look over in enthusiasm, afraid that he would miss out a single word of his teacher.What Lu Xun laoshi and Wang Chao laoshi... All of these has been thrown to the back of their minds!Not just them, even the elders would have to kneel when compared to Zhang laoshi!........................\"To rush in like this, I hope that young master is fine!\"Outside the classroom, Old Liu looks worriedly at Wang Tao, who had barged into the classroom furiously.\"Rest easy, Wang Tao-shaoye has reached Fighter 4-dan Pigu realm while that Zhang Xuan is still stuck at Zhenqi realm. Soon, he would be able to teach him a lesson and bring young mistress Wang Ying out!\"Shaoye -> Young master.Yao Han nods his head with a bright smile on his face.Just as he is visioning the pathetic state the shameless teacher would be in with his teeth scattered all over the floor, he suddenly hears Wang Tao's furious howl from the room.\"It has begun!\"Yao Han's eyes light up and the edges of his mouth creep upwards.If that Zhang Xuan was only the last in the entire academy, Yao Han wouldn't be bothered to interfere in his affairs. However, to think that he would dare to be disrespectful to the young mistress!If Zhang Xuan didn't execute some underhanded tricks, how could the young mistress possibly willingly acknowledge him as her teacher?If Yao Han were to make a move personally, he would definitely incur the ire of the young mistress, not to mention offending the Hongtian Academy at that. It would be more than ideal for Wang Tao to make a move in his stead!Hongtian Academy is located in Tianxuan Royal Capital, the home ground of the Wang family. Even if Wang Tao were to beat up a teacher, they would definitely have the means to deal with it! Furthermore, Wang Tao is the disciple of an elder and holds an esteemed position in the academy. It is much more appropriate for him to make a move.\"Hehe, I would like to see how would that trash of a teacher embarrass himself...\"The more he thinks about it, the more delighted he gets. Yao Han creeps towards the doorstep, intending to open up a crack between the doors and peek through it when he hears a boom and the tightly-shut doors burst open.Peng!Yao Han didn't even have the time to react from the sudden assault by the metal door. It slams right into his face, rattling his consciousness. In the midst of his daze, a head comes crashing into him!Kacha!The intimate encounter between his face and the head creates the crisp melody of the cracking of a bone and the two remaining teeth that survived yesterday's attack after much difficulty dislodges valiantly.\"Pu!\"The intense pain causes Yao Han to convulse and a mouthful of fresh blood bursts forth.His body isn't fragile, but... he had yet to recover from his injuries from the prior day. Yesterday, he had been bashed in his face and now, he was slammed by a metal door before a head comes crashing into him right after... It is already quite a blessing for him to be alive at this point.\"Young master...\"Old Liu realizes that the one who was sent flying was his young master and he dashes over, frightened.\"Damn it, damn it!\"Wang Tao might have knocked into the metal door, but with Yao Han cushioning his fall, he isn't severely injured by that encounter. Standing up and recalling how the 'trash' caught his blow and threw him out, he feels an intense fear. Although he shouted loudly, he didn't dare to approach the classroom anymore.\"Young master Wang Tao, you... you...\"Faint-headed, Yao Han only realizes at this point that the one who knocked into him is Wang Tao. With an intrigued expression, he struggles to stand up.Didn't you rush in to beat him up? How come you are the one who was sent flying out?\"I... I was practicing as a new type of battle technique!\" Wang Tao didn't dare to say that he had been thrown out by a 'trash', so he could only come up with something else.\"Battle technique?\" Yao Han's vision is still blurry from the previous impact. He hurriedly questions, \"Did you expose the true face of that fellow? How did our young mistress react...\"\"Cough cough. I... I didn't have the time to make a move when my younger sister pushed me out. I think... why don't we try waiting here!\" Wang Tao says with an embarrassed look.Just a moment ago, he was still declaring how he would make the other party suffer. Yet, the next moment, he was sent flying out. He wouldn't acknowledge such a shameful affair even if he were beaten to the verge of death!\"Wait?\"Yao Han scratches his head as doubts appear in his mind. However, he didn't think that he should point them out, so he chooses to change the topic instead, \"Wang Tao shaoye, I have a question to ask of you, seeing how you are also a student of Hongtian Academy!\"Shaoye -> Young master\"Go ahead!\"Seeing how Yao Han doesn't continue pursuing the events that transpired in the classroom, Wang Tao heaves a sigh of relief and replies.\"Is there any female teachers in the academy who has 'Bi' in their name?\" Recalling the fellow who beat him up the previous day, Yao Han's anger billows.\"Bi? The most famous one of them all is the academy's female goddess, Shen Bi Ru! I heard that Zhang Xuan laoshi wanted to court her as well. He is truly a toad lusting over... the flesh of a swan...\"Halfway through his words, Wang Tao pauses abruptly.Before this, everyone knew that Zhang Xuan's abilities were sub-par and his capability as a teacher was horrendous as well. With such standards, he dared to pursue the academy's female goddess Shen Bi Ru... That's why everyone termed him as such. Now that Wang Tao has experienced the other party's strength first-hand and understands that he is on a different level from him, he finds it unnatural to continue saying that he is a toad lusting over the flesh of a swan!\"Shen Bi Ru? Zhang Xuan wants to court her?\" Yao Han's eyes light up as he comes to a realization. The person whom the fellow yesterday was talking about must be her. He continues asking, \"Other than Zhang laoshi, is there anyone else who is courting her?\"\"Shen laoshi is incredibly beautiful, the teachers who wish to court her are far too many for me to count. However, the most famous of them all is the grandson of Elder Shang Chen, Shang Bin laoshi!\" After pondering for a moment, Wang Tao looks over in suspicion, \"Why is butler Yao asking such a question?\"\"Oh, I am just casually asking!\"Yao Han doesn't touch any further on the topic, but a glint flashes past his eyes.\"I will be able to ascertain it after looking into whether this Shang Bin had gotten into a conflict with Zhang Xuan yesterday. If it really is him, regardless of whether he is the son of an elder, I would definitely make him suffer...\"When had the butler of the Baiyu City Lord, a figure that rises above the others, standing beneath only an individual, suffered such a great injustice!If he doesn't seek vengeance on him, it would be hard to quell the resentment accumulating in his heart. For it, he is willing to turn into a demon!..........................................While Yao Han is still considering whom he should find to gather intelligence, the person in question, Shang Bin, had just finished conducting a lesson and had left his classroom when he met a young man.Cao Xiong laoshi!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Looking for TroubleTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Shang shaoye!\"Shaoye -> Young masterCao Xiong says respectfully.\"Cao Xiong laoshi, you were looking for me?\" Shang Bin looks over with a puzzled expression.They might be both teachers of the academy and they often bump into one another, but their relationship is still stuck at the level of an acquaintance.\"Indeed. I have something which I would have to trouble Shang shaoye with!\" Cao Xiong hesitates for a moment before speaking.\"As long as it is something I could help you with, I will try my best!\" Cao Xiong replies.As the grandson of Elder Shang Chen, there are quite a few teachers who come looking for him for favors every day and he has long gotten used to it.\"Is that so? I... Yesterday, I took much difficulty in admitting a student under my tutelage, but he was snatched away by another teacher through deception. Isn't Elder Shang in charge of the Education Bureau? I would like to ask... if it is possible to transfer the student back to me...\"Cao Xiong says.Liu Yang is the best student which he spent a lot of effort to recruit. Yet, he lost him to Zhang Xuan due to that bet. When he returned, he got angrier and angrier the more he thought about it. Eventually, he couldn't bear it anymore and came to look for Shang Bin today.Shang Bin's grandfather is Elder Shang Chen, the head of the academy's Education Bureau. Allocating a student to another teacher would be quite a simple feat for him.\"Transfer back?\" Shang Bin frowns. \"If that student willingly came under the other person's tutelage, it would be difficult! You also know that students are much more troublesome nowadays. If they are dissatisfied with anything, they would report the incident to the Royal Court and the Teacher Union, then we will...\"\"He isn't willing! I can guarantee that!\" Cao Xiong hurriedly replies.\"Even if he isn't willing, if the other teacher is unwilling to let him go, it won't be easy as well. You know the school rules...\" Shang Bin waves his hand. Suddenly, he raises his head and asks, \"Just now, you said... deception? May I know which teacher is the one who coaxed your student over?\"\"It is our academy's 'trash teacher' Zhang Xuan...\" Speaking of that young man, Cao Xiong clenches his jaws and hatred could be plainly seen on his face.\"Zhang Xuan? Your student was coaxed over by him?\" Hearing that name once again, Shang Bin's rage burns once again.If it wasn't for this fellow, he would definitely be able to get a dinner date with his goddess! A fellow who is only Fighter 3-dan and scored a zero for him Teacher Qualification Examination would actually dare to disregard his authority, he is seeking for death!If it wasn't for the presence of the goddess yesterday such that it was inconvenient to resort to physical means, he would have definitely beat him until he is on the verge of dying!\"Yes! Since he is that kind of teacher, no humans would be willing to become his student! So, I would like to trouble Shang shaoye to help me bring up this matter with Elder Shang and allocate my student back...\" Cao Xiong says carefully, afraid that the other party would refuse his request.\"There is no need to bring this up with Elder Shang, I will settle this matter for you now!\" Shang Bin waves his hand majestically.\"You're going to settle the matter for me?\"\"The other teachers might still require the help of my grandfather for the reallocation process but since we're talking about the useless trash Zhang Xuan, why do we have to go through so much trouble? We just have to go to him straight and if he refuses, we will cripple him!\"Shang Bin gestures grandly.He might be at a loss in means to deal with other teachers, but towards the one who scored a zero for the Teacher Qualification Examination, it is simply too easy for him to make a stand to teach him a lesson!Disregarding his weak abilities, the crux of it is that no one in the academy would possibly come in his defense.The most important point of all is that he had intended to give Zhang Xuan a good thrashing to vent his frustration but he had been vexed over the lack of a suitable justification for it.If he were to strike without a suitable justification, he would surely leave a bad impression with Shen Bi Ru if she were to find out.But now, he has duped away the student of another teacher and the person in question has come over seeking for his help. He could make use of this reason to lash out at him!\"This...\" He didn't expect that Shang Bin would be so generous, Cao Xiong is taken aback.\"There is no need for 'this'. Come with me! If you're afraid, I will do it for you!\" The corners of Shang Bin's lip curl upwards as a glint of brutality flashes across his eyes.\"Then, I will be thanking Shang shaoye in advance!\" Cao Xiong's eyes light up excitedly as he nods his head hurriedly. The two of them move towards Zhang Xuan's classroom with widened strides.It didn't take long for them to arrive at the entrance of Zhang Xuan's classroom to see the mummy-like Yao Han and the young master of the Wang family.\"Wang Tao, what are you doing here instead of training over at grandfather's? Shang Bin frowns.He might be the grandson of Elder Shang Chen, but he is still a little off in terms of standing in comparison to Wang Tao.\"Shang Bin laoshi!\" Wang Tao bows. \"My younger sister was duped to attend lessons here. I intend to take her back...\"\"Shang Bin?\"Yao Han was still considering whom he should gather intelligence on Shang Bin from when he heard that the young man before him is Shang Bin. He hurriedly lifts his head to take a good look at him.\"You mean Wang Ying xiaojie?\" Shang Bin's face darkens. Coldness radiates out of his eyes as he declares, \"That Zhang Xuan is really too daring! To dare to dupe even Wang xiaojie, he must be tired of living! Looks like if I don't teach him a lesson, it would be hard to appease the crowd!\"Xiaojie -> Young mistress\"Indeed...\" Wang Tao nods his head.\"Since Wang Ying xiaojie was duped to come under his tutelage, why don't you barge in to stop him, and chose to wait here instead?\" Harrumphing, Shang Bin looks over with a puzzled expression.\"That...\" Wang Tao dares not to admit that he was thrown out. Scratching his head, just when he is perplexed over how he should answer, Yao Han, who is beside him, says, \"Isn't there a rule in the academy that states that entry into a classroom is disallowed in the midst of a lesson? Thus, we could only wait outside for the lessons to end!\"\"This is...\"Only now does Shang Bin notice the mummy-like Yao Han.\"This is the butler of City Lord Zhao of Baiyu City, Yao Han!\" Wang Tao hurriedly introduces him.\"So, it is butler Yao. I have long heard of your name!\" Shang Bin nods his head and continues, \"There is such a rule in the academy that no one is allowed to barge into the classroom in the midst of a lesson. However, it doesn't matter in this case. You all can follow behind me to enter the classroom. Today, I will personally take care of the fellow who has no morals as a teacher and goes around conning others!\"\"Alright!\" Hearing that he is going to make a move, Wang Tao's eyes light up and follows closely behind him. Yao Han hesitates for a moment before following behind them.....................................In the classroom.\"Hongtian Nine Dan Formula. It might be the most basic cultivation technique of Hongtian Academy, but there are quite a few problems with it. For example...\"The five students sit in the classroom, listening attentively to Zhang Xuan's explanations.Despite it only being the first lecture, they are all incomparably shocked. It is as though they have consumed ginseng fruit and is getting drunk on his words.The few students present in the classroom, with the exception of Yuan Tao, have exceptional backgrounds. They might have never gone to an academy, but they had learned everything systematically. They have undergone lectures of many different teachers and even had the privilege of having Fighter 5-dan and 6-dan experts offering them pointer... However, they had never been to such a lesson in their entire life.The lecture gives them a feeling of enlightenment. They found themselves suddenly comprehending many things that they were perplexed in the past. The breath in their body seems to be tempted to follow the methods which the teacher is describing to them and a sensation that they would be able to break through any time now gushes through them.The lecture is simply too well-said!Hearing Zhang Xuan's lessons, they realize that even the supposed high-level teachers pale greatly in comparison to him.This is especially so for Zhao Ya. As the daughter of a city lord, her father often deciphers cultivation techniques for her. Initially, she had always thought that her father is the best lecturer in the entire Tianxuan Kingdom. After all, her father's strength is clear for all to see!However, in comparison to Zhang laoshi, she feels like a frog in the well! It is laughable. There is totally no way to compare the both of them at all!Zhang laoshi's explanations are spot-on. No matter how incredible the cultivation technique and battle technique is, he is able to immediately spot the flaws in it, causing one to be shocked and go into deep thoughts, unable to calm the agitation in them for a long period of time.Often, a single deciphering sentence of Zhang laoshi would send them into thoughts for half a day. After they finally comprehend it after much difficulty, they would realize that he had already been talking for a long period of time and that they had missed many of the knowledge which he had imparted then.\"Zhang laoshi's standards... are way too high!\"At this moment, the five students finally understand how deep the foundations of battle techniques and how wide the tree of knowledge is within this young man who isn't much older than them.\"Previously, I laughably thought that Zhang laoshi had simply lucked out to make my strength soar instantaneously. Only now do I realize that... given his wisdom, it is a small feat for him to accomplish such greatness! There are more than a hundred methods for him to make my strength increase by a fold...\"The previously arrogant Liu Yang couldn't help but tremble on the spot, \"In comparison to him, Cao Xiong laoshi... Sigh, I better not compare the two of them. They are at totally different heights, there is no way to compare the two of them. It is like they both exist in different worlds! It is fortunate that they made that bet, otherwise, how could I possibly meet such a great teacher...\"The five students are each listening attentively to the lecture in agitation, afraid that they would miss some important knowledge.Jiyaaaaa!The door to the classroom is pushed open and a few men walk in with large strides.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: Enlightenment Will TrialTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexEnlightenment Will Trial\u201cZhang Xuan, I didn't expect that your guts would be so inflated after not meeting for a day!\u201d Walking into the room, Shang Bin surveys the surroundings and notices that the 'trash' had managed to admit in five students. A savage expression flashes across his eyes as he sneers coldly, \u201cTo dare to deceive Wang Ying xiaojie, Zhao Ya xiaojie and the others, as well as to coax the student of Cao Xiong laoshi to come under your tutelage instead, where the hell did you find such courage!\u201d\u201cShang Bin laoshi? Cao Xiong laoshi?\u201dSeeing the few people who just barged in, Zhang Xuan frowns, \u201cI am in the midst of a lesson. If there's anything you want to say, please say them after the lessons!\u201d\u201cLesson your head! Shang shaoye came personally over so what the hell are you acting so high and mighty for? Given your standards, it is already a blessing for the others to not be misguided by you, yet you talk about having lessons? You little brat who don't even know the basics, how dare to pretend like you're something big before us!\u201d Cao Xiong mocks Zhang Xuan coldly.Since the both of them are already hostile to one another, there is no need for him to put on an act anymore.\u201cGet out! You're not welcome here!\u201d Zhang Xuan narrows his eyes.\u201cYou are still continuing on with the act? Zhang Xuan, do you even remember your own surname?\u201d Shang Bin laughs coldly, \u201cQuickly release Zhao Ya xiaojie and Wang Ying xiaojie from your lessons and reallocate Liu Yang back to Cao Xiong laoshi. If so, I might choose to back down and not teach you a lesson today. Otherwise\u2026 I'm afraid that you will have to spend this school term in a wheelchair!\u201d\u201cYou want to make a move on me?\u201d Zhang Xuan glances over, \u201cThe academy forbids teachers from fighting one another within its compounds. Is Shang Bin laoshi unaware of the academy rules?\u201d\u201cThe academy rules are made for humans. Against others, I would still be worried about the consequences about flouting those rules, but towards you\u2026 Hehe, do you think that there would be anyone in the academy who would stand up for a trash like you?\u201d Shang Bin declares with an expression that clearly spells out that his vile intentions.\u201cI get it, is it because I offended you with my words yesterday, that's why you are intentionally seeking trouble with me now? Aren't you afraid that Shen Bi Ru laoshi would be displeased by such actions of yours?\u201d Zhang Xuan harrumphs.\u201cHehe, at least you are well-aware of it. Since I have decided to teach you a lesson, of course, I won't be worried about you talking nonsense\u2026\u201d Shang Bin doesn't deny it and just as he is about to gleefully step forward to teach the fellow before him a lesson, he is interrupted by another furious voice.\u201cIt's you!\u201dYao Han's eyes turn red.Given how Zhang Xuan had offended Shang Bin yesterday and Shen Bi Ru laoshi is involved in the incident as well, if Yao Han is still unable to figure out the culprit who beat him up, even he himself would suspect that he is a fool!\u201cWhat?\u201d Seeing butler Yao rage out when he is about to punish Zhang Xuan, Shang Bin turns around to look at him, bewildered.\u201cDo you think that it is possible for you to be unaware of what you have done?\u201dBefore Shang Bin could react, accompanied by a loud roar, a fist smashes violently onto his face.\u201cThe heck!\u201dShang Bin could only feel everything before him turning dark. The regions around his eyes bruised up. His body staggers for a moment before falling to the ground.\u201cTo dare to beat me up to such a pathetic state, I will make you suffer for it!\u201dRecalling the agony he undergone from the beating yesterday, there isn't any hesitation in Yao Han's blows at all. Sitting onto Shang Bin's body, fist after fist come raging onto him like a storm.\u201cButler Yao\u2026\u201dEverything occurred too quickly. Wang Tao and Cao Xiong is flabbergasted.Actually, there aren't the only ones who were taken aback, even Zhao Ya, Wang Ying and the others stare at one another in confusion.Just a moment ago, when these few people came over to find trouble with Zhang laoshi, Zhang Xuan's students were still quite enraged and had intended to stand up for him. Yet, before they could do anything, the other side started fighting among themselves.Isn't this incident too bizarre!This is especially so for Zhao Ya. She is well-aware of the personality of butler Yao. He is a very dignified and rational person who handles problems systematically. Otherwise, her father wouldn't have possibly allowed him to become the butler of their family.But\u2026 what happened today? Why did he start beating up Shang Bin before he could finish his words?Probably, the only one who knows what is happening is Zhang Xuan.The reason why he intentionally mentioned that he offended Shang Bin yesterday and brought up Shen Bi Ru's name is to remind butler Yao of the two features of his attacker yesterday\u2026 In the end, just as he intended, he made a move on Shang Bin!Actually, this cannot be blamed on butler Yao for being rash. After all, no matter who it is, if they were to be beaten up out of the blue for no good reason, they would definitely hold some resentment in their heart. Furthermore, he is of esteemed position and represents the image of Baiyu City, so he had never suffered such injustice. To add on, he had been angered by Zhang Xuan multiple times these two days and his young mistress had been curbing him from assaulting him. Without an outlet to vent his frustration, it has been welling up in his chest. At this moment, when he has met his enemy, how could he stand it any further?\u201cButler Yao, what are you doing?!\u201d Feeling the fists crashing down onto him like raindrops, the confused Shang Bin could only feel his vision going dark. He almost threw up a mouthful of fresh blood.What is going on?This is the first time he is meeting this butler Yao and he shouldn't have offended him before, so why the heck is he so brutal?No matter how he tries to recall, he couldn't fathom how he could have possibly offended the other party!\u201cWhat am I doing? Stop acting ignorant here, are you not aware of it yourself?\u201dPeng peng peng peng!Butler Yao's fist came landing one after another without any moment of rest.Shang Bin is a high-level teacher and has reached the level of Fighter 5-dan Dingli realm. Even so, there is still a distance between him and Yao Han's 6-dan Pixue realm. He isn't even a match for Yao Han in a normal battle, needless to say, a sudden assault. He is done in with just a single punch.\u201cButler Yao, calm down, calm down. We can talk things through calmly\u2026\u201dOnly now then do Cao Xiong and Wang Tao regain their senses and they hurriedly pull the both of them apart.At this moment, Shang Bin's handsome face is swollen to the point that there is no difference between it and a pig's head.\u201cDamn it!\u201d Shang Bin is about to explode from anger.Initially, he had intended to teach Zhang Xuan a lesson but never in his dreams did he expect the butler Yao from Baiyu City to suddenly go insane and assault him!At this moment, all of his accumulated rage channels onto towards butler Yao!\u201cNo matter what personal grudges the few of you may hold among yourselves, please settle it outside the classroom. This isn't a location for you all to fight it out. If you all do not leave now and continue to interrupt my lessons, I will inform the Central Education Bureau and call them over\u2026\u201dZhang Xuan speaks up.\u201cFine\u2026 Just you all wait!\u201dHearing that he would inform the Central Education Bureau, Shang Bin turns around and walks away.If news were to spread about his current state, how could still possibly have the face to meet others? He must not allow any teachers to see him in his current state!\u201cShang shaoye\u2026 Shang shaoye!\u201dShaoye -> Young masterInitially, Cao Xiong thought that it would be an easy task. With Shang shaoye making a move personally, he would definitely he able to get Zhang Xuan to return his student. However, never in his dreams did he expect to see such a situation occurring. Cao Xiong hurriedly follows behind him.Soon, the two of them disappear from view.\u201cUncle Yao, what are you doing?\u201dAfter the two of them left, Zhao Ya walks up and looks at her Uncle Yao, her face flushed red from anger.This Uncle Yao was normal in the past, so why is he getting more and more overboard nowadays!\u201cYoung mistress, I\u2026\u201d Yao Han doesn't know how he should reply to Zhao Ya's words.After all, he can't possibly say that he had intended to sneak over to Zhang Xuan's dormitory in an attempt to castrate him but ended up getting bashed up by Shang Bin instead, and he did a moment ago was to exact vengeance for that!\u201cAlright, I am still in the midst of the lesson. I would have to ask for the rest of you to leave!\u201dZhang Xuan gestures.After hesitating for a moment, Yao Han, Wang Tao and Old Liu leave the classroom yet again.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cDamn it, damn it!\u201dAfter leaving Zhang Xuan's classroom, Shang Bin cries out in anger, \u201cThat Yao Han must be taught a lesson. Zhang Xuan as well. To dare to look at me contemptuously, he must be punished!\u201dAs the grandson of an elder, his life has been smooth sailing all along. When had he ever suffered such injustice!Furthermore, the worst of it all is that he didn't even know the reason behind it.He was in the midst of talking when the other party suddenly rushed up to assault him in the blink of an eye! He finds the scenario incomprehensible!\u201cThat Yao Han must be an accomplice of Zhang Xuan! Otherwise, why would he make a move on Shang shaoye? I think he must have been ordered to do so!\u201d Cao Xiong says.\u201cNo doubt, that must be it!\u201d Shang Bin agrees.He had never offended Yao Han, but the other party made a move on him without any warnings. It must be due to his declaration of wanting to teach Zhang Xuan a lesson!\u201cAre you sure that Liu Yang did not willingly acknowledge Zhang Xuan as his teacher?\u201dAfter awhile, Shang Bin calms down and turns around to ask.\u201cI can ascertain that he didn't do it out of his own free will!\u201d Recalling the unwillingness on Liu Yang's face when he left yesterday, Cao Xiong replies confidently.\u201cGreat. If you're that sure of it, go and apply for a [ Enlightenment Will Trial ]!\u201d Shang Bin says.\u201cEnlightenment Will Trial? This\u2026\u201d Cao Xiong's face darkens.Enlightenment Will Trial is a special method to determine the allocation of a student who is vied by multiple teachers when the academy is unable to make a judgment. The student would undergo the trial of the [ Enlightenment Will Tower ] and the Enlightenment Will Tower will reflect his true thoughts in the form of a confidence-meter.If the student is proven to be unwilling to come under the tutelage of the teacher, the teacher of the student will be punished. On the other hand, if it is proven that the one who applied for the Enlightenment Will Trial is making a false report, he would receive an equivalent punishment.This is the final resort used when there is truly no means to determine the allocation of the student.Cao Xiong is aware of it, but he feels that things have yet to get to such an irreconcilable point.\u201cWhy? Are you lying to me? Could it be that the fellow joined Zhang Xuan willingly?\u201d Looking at Cao Xiong's hesitant face, Shang Bin's face darkens even further.\u201cNo, he definitely did not join willingly. I\u2026 will apply now! I will make sure Zhang Xuan will get what he deserves!\u201d Cao Xiong nods his head.\u201cUn, then hurry up!\u201d Looking at his compliance, Shang Bin nods his head in satisfaction. \u201cWhen you are applying for it, make sure to raise the punishment to the maximum! This way, Zhang Xuan would be in for a tough time, perhaps he might even get fired!\u201dPunishment can be raised based on the applier's request. The higher the stakes are, the heavier the penalty on the side who fails the trial.\u201cAlright!\u201d Cao Xiong's eyes light up with excitement as he visions the image of Zhang Xuan getting fired.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: The Frenzied Wang ClanTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Alright, we will end the lessons here. Everyone, remember to try to comprehend the contents of this lesson when you get back. If there is anything you are unsure of, you can come over to me to clarify it!\"Zhang Xuan gestures.\"Yes!\" The five students answers in chorus before leaving the classroom.They didn't spend a long time immersed in the lesson and there were even a couple of times where someone barged in to create trouble, but they still benefited greatly from it. It can even be said that if they were to persist on to try to comprehend what was taught, their cultivation would surely rise by leaps and bounds.The five of them leave the room excitedly. The moment Wang Ying walks out, her elder brother, Wang Tao, grabs her.\"Go, let's return back to our clan!\"\"Return back to our clan? Big brother, why must we return...\" Wang Ying is taken aback.\"Hmph, you refused to listen to the words of your elder brother and chose to acknowledge the worst teacher in the academy as your teacher. I have already reported this matter to father and he says that he would like to talk to you personally!\" Wang Tao harrumphs.The first time he entered the classroom, he was thrown out. The second time, he returned without accomplishing anything. Judging from the expression on his younger sister, he knows that he would be unable to convince her to change her mind. Thus, he sent Old Liu back to inform the clan of the matter.He intends to get their father to persuade her.His younger sister's personality might be pure and innocent, but she still listens rather obediently to the words of their father.\"Father...\" Fright could be seen on Wang Ying's face.Their father is the current clan head of the Wang clan, Wang Hong!He is a very strict person who rarely smiles, even his children tremble before his presence.\"Zhang Xuan laoshi actually isn't the way that you all put him out to be. His lectures are very good...\"Wang Ying tries to retort.\"Hmph, say those words to father and see if he believes it!\" Wang Tao waves his hand and without a second word, he pulls his younger sister out of the academy.Hongtian Academy and the Wang clan are both in Tianxuan City and they aren't too far apart from one another. In a short moment, the two siblings reach their destination and Wang Tao pulls Wang Ying to their father's study.\"Enter!\"The cold and strict voice of clan head Wang Hong sounds out.\"Yes!\" Wang Ying tremors from fright upon hearing that voice. Clenching her jaws, she follows closely behind her elder brother into the room.In the study, clan head Wang Hong is sitting at the utmost center of the room. The few sitting behind him are the influential elders within the clan. There is also one youth who is sitting by the side.Wang Ying recognizes the youth as the grandson of the 2nd Elder, Wang Yan.She went to the Hongtian Academy at the same time as Wang Yan. In the end, the latter managed to acknowledge the renowned Lu Xun laoshi as his teacher whereas she acknowledged the academy's worst reputed teacher Zhang Xuan...\"Father!\" The tense atmosphere in the study makes Wang Ying dare not to breathe heavily.\"Kneel down!\"Clan head Wang Hong's face darkens.The teacher plays an utmost role on one's route of cultivation. Before entering the academy, he has reminded her time and time again to acknowledge Lu Xun as her teacher. Yet, this lass...Why can't you acknowledge anyone else?Why must you choose the worst one in the whole academy?When he heard that news, he almost died from sheer anger.Putong!Wang Ying shivers as she kneels down.\"Do you admit your mistake?\" Wang Hong asks coldly.\"I...\"\"Hmph, acknowledging one's teacher should be based on an individual's free will, so I didn't want to say too much about it, but are you unaware of the standards of this Zhang Xuan laoshi? The one who scored the worst for the Teacher Qualification Examination and even left a student berserk. Does someone like that have the qualifications to become your teacher?\" Clan head Wang Hong says with a grave expression on his face. \"If you were unaware of the situation and were deceived by him, I would still turn a blind eye to it, but why didn't you listen to your brother's words? I heard that your elder brother asked you to withdraw from his lessons, but you refuted him? What are you trying to do?\"Clan head Wang Hong's voice becomes louder and louder, to the point that the study tremors with creaking noises.\"I...\" Hearing the reprimand of her father, Wang Ying's face turns red before she grits her jade teeth and says, \"Father, Zhang Xuan laoshi isn't as bad as the rumors put him out to be. He is a talented teacher, just that he keeps a low profile. I want to be under his tutelage, I will not withdraw from his lessons!\"She benefited greatly from just a single lesson. Wang Ying knows that coming under the tutelage of Zhang Xuan is an opportunity for her. If she were to miss this chance, she would definitely regret it for the rest of her life.\"A talented teacher? Haha, a fellow who scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination?\"\"Wang Ying, you should listen to the advice of the clan head, don't be deceived by that Zhang Xuan!\"\"You should learn from Wang Yan. He might have only gone on one lesson, but his strength has already increased by 40%. The guidance of Lu Xun laoshi is definitely top-notch in the entire academy!\"...Hearing the words of the young lady, the other elders laugh as they shake their head.There isn't a single person in Tianxuan City who is unaware of Zhang Xuan's reputation. Yet, you say that he is a talented teacher... What kind of joke is this!\"You...\" Hearing the words of his daughter, clan head Wang Hong is incensed, \"I don't care what you say, you have to withdraw from his lessons today! Otherwise, don't even think about stepping into this house ever again!\"\"I don't agree with your decision!\" Wang Ying may seem weak, but she has a stubborn temperament. She stands up and says indignantly, \"You all have never listened into Zhang Xuan laoshi's lessons, so what rights do you all have to say that his lessons are sub par? What rights do you all have to force me to withdraw from his lessons?\"\"We might not have listened into his lessons before, but do you think it is possible for his reputation and Teacher Qualification Examination results to be falsified?\" An elder replies.\"Wang Ying xiaojie, stop being stubborn. There are so many students who can testify for whether his lessons are good or not. Do you think that you are the only smart one of the bunch?\" Another elder states.Xiaojie -> Young mistress\"I don't know whether the Teacher Qualification Examination results are falsified or not, but I know that he has treated my legs and gave me pointers for my cultivation. I can easily execute a might that is one-fold greater than previously!\" Wang Ying declares.\"Treated your legs? What kind of joke is this!\"\"Even Master Yuanyu is unable to do anything about your legs. Yet, you claim that a fellow who scored zero for the Teacher Qualification Examination is able to treat it?\"\"Wang Ying xiaojie, even if you wish to lie in his stead, you should say something that is more believable...\"Everyone in the clan is aware of Wang Ying's leg injury. Hearing her words, a few of the elders scoff coldly.\"If you all don't believe me, I will prove it to you all!\"Seeing the looks of disbelief on the elders' faces, Wang Ying doesn't continue arguing and instead, walks over to the Strength Measuring Rock Pillar and sends a kick towards it.Peng!The rock pillar shakes and a string of numbers appear.205!\"What?\"Seeing this sight, clan head Wang Hong's eyes narrow subconsciously.The few elders who were reprimanding Wang Ying a moment ago are also taken aback as their lips tremble from shock.The few elders here had specially looked into the injury of Wang Ying's legs and had deduced that it is impossible to treat it. They concluded that it would be impossible to exert strength in them and just the fact that she is able to walk normally is already a blessing.Yet, to wield 205kg behind such legs?How... How is this possible?After kicking the pillar, Wang Ying didn't stop. She turns around and strikes on the pillar with a fist.Weng!Numbers display on the rock pillar.120!A force of 120kg behind her fists!\"You... You're still Juxi realm primary stage. I thought you were only able to hit 53kg when you left yesterday? How could it be possible for you to hit... 120kg?\" Clan head Wang Hong abruptly stands up as his voice quivers in agitation.Fighter 1-dan Juxi realm, cultivators would learn innate breathing and sensing of spirit in the air. Also, they would gain the ability to look into their body and control the flow of spirit energy in their body with their mind.They would have a strength of 50kg in their primary stage, 70kg in the intermediate stage, 90kg in the advanced stage and 110kg at the pinnacle.This is the mass that a cultivator would be able to carry with their present strength. It is normal for the strength behind their fist to be slightly lower or higher than the strength attributed to their level of cultivation.Normally, it would already be incredible to achieve an increase of 20% to 30% around that level. Even for a renowned teacher like Lu Xun, he could only induce an improvement of 40%!Despite not breaking through in her cultivation, being still in Juxi realm primary stage, she is able to hit with a force of 120kg, even stronger than someone at Juxi realm pinnacle! This means that her strength enhancement is greater than a single fold, that is too formidable!\"I only improved to such an extent due to Zhang Xuan laoshi's guidance!\" After hitting the pillar, Wang Ying stops and declares calmly.\"With just a slight pointer, he is able to induce such a great improvement? Furthermore... treating your legs as well?\"Clan leader Wang Hong is in a state of disbelief. In a few short steps, he walks to the front of his daughter. With a single look, he immediately understands that his daughter's legs are truly cured!As the worst teacher in the entire academy, not only was he able to treat an injury Master Yuanyu is unable to cure, he was even to induce a massive improvement through a short moment of guidance. Is this for real?\"Can you tell us a little about the contents of the lessons he went through today? What did he talk about?\"After a short period of shock, clan head Wang Hong can't resist asking.\"Alright. Today, Zhang laoshi talked about cultivation technique. However, as what he talked about was too profound, I could only remember less than a tenth of it. This is what he said...\"After hesitating for a moment, she mentions everything that she recalls in her mind.\"Gathering one's breath and nourishing it... To think that there would be such a profound theory behind a simple Juxi realm!\"\"This... is too incredible. If only I had undergone such lessons back then, I wouldn't be stuck in such a realm, unable to advance ahead!\"\"This is truly the theory derived from a true master. I am enlightened...\"...Just by repeating a few sentences, the clan head and the elders in the room seem to have gone into a daze, as though they are drunk on those words, on the verge of going frenzied.To be able to become the clan head and an elder of a prestigious clan, they all possess high levels of cultivation, even the weakest of them are Fighter 6-dan Pixue realm experts.After cultivating for so many years, they have a higher level of enlightenment towards cultivation and they understand much more about it.Although Wang Ying is only reciting those words without understanding the underlying theories behind them, to them, those words are no different from the voice of god. It solves many of the mysteries that they were unable to decipher before in an instant and they feel refreshed.\"He... He is truly a master... No, not even a master is able to explain such profound and mystical theories!\" Clan head Wang Hong's eyes radiate a bright light and his breath quickens in agitation.\"Father, father?\"Seeing her father on the verge of going into a frenzy, Wang Ying tries to pull him back.\"Ah? Ying-er, you must not withdraw from this Zhang laoshi's lesson by all cause! You must learn from him diligently...\" After clan head Wang Hong's consciousness is pulled back from a mystical realm, formhe looks at Wang Ying with a solemn expression and says.\"But father, you just said that...\" She didn't expect that her father, who tends to be conservative, would change his mind so quickly, to the extent that she is unable to adapt to it on the spot.\"Father didn't know that Zhang laoshi would be so incredible! Oh, right...\"At this point, clan head Wang Hong's face has traces of excitement and anticipation on his face as he asks, \"Ying-er, can you ask your Zhang laoshi... whether he is still accepting student? Let Wang Yan and Tao-er learn from him as well... Actually, why don't I become his student as well...\"\"Clan head, as the leader of the Wang clan, how could you become the student of the low-level teacher in the academy? If word were to spread, how can our Wang clan continue to uphold our dignity in Tianxuan City?\"Before clan head Wang Hong could finish his words, he is interrupted by the words of another elder. After reprimanding the clan head, the elder turns over with a bundle of smiles and says, \"Look, I am only a normal elder and I don't represent the image of the Wang clan. If it is still unacceptable, I can even resign from my position of an elder. So, can you all help me ask him if I am able to acknowledge him as my teacher?\"\"...\" Wang Tao, Wang Ying and Wang Yan.\"...\" Clan head Wang Hong.Ying-er, Tao-erThis is quite a close way to address one's sons and daughters, sometimes even close nephews etc.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Enraged Elder MoTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexEnraged Elder MoZhang Xuan isn't aware of the events that occurred in the Wang clan. After the lesson ended, he walks towards the Compendium Pavilion.\u201cMy cultivation might have progressed significantly, but I still don't have an in-depth understanding of battle techniques and such. I should quickly look into them! Also, I should also take a look at the 1-dan and 2-dan cultivation techniques. Otherwise, if I were to go the lessons without knowing anything, I would definitely give myself away!\u201dZhang Xuan's had multiple breakthroughs in his cultivation yesterday night, causing his strength has soared significantly. However, his knowledge on battle techniques and such are severely lacking. Furthermore, he doesn't have an in-depth knowledge of the 1-dan and 2-dan cultivation techniques. For example, when he was offering pointers to Zhao Ya earlier today, he didn't know what kind of cultivation technique he should have imparted her to resolve the problem of her Pure Yin Body.This is the ideal time to do a bit of research and prepare for the next lesson.Otherwise, if he is unable to answer the questions of his students, he would expose his ignorance.\u201cElder Mo!\u201dArriving at the Compendium Pavilion again, Elder Mo is still guarding the entrance to it.\u201cWhat are you here for?\u201dYesterday, this fellow, in pursuit of his vanity, came here to make a mess, so Elder Mo had a bad impression of him. Seeing how he is here today again, he couldn't help but frown.\u201cI would like to see the manuals on battle techniques!\u201d Zhang Xuan bows.\u201cBattle techniques? One's cultivation level is the core of one's strength. Instead of training properly with your cultivation technique, you just had to learn from the negative examples of others, pursuing vanity, enjoying the pleasures of the illusion and slacking about! Today, you don't have to think about entering the Compendium Pavilion!\u201dElder Mo waves his hand to chase him away.In his opinion, Zhang Xuan purpose here isn't even to read the books\u2026 Rather, he is here to flip through them to remember a few distinguished points in them to put up a knowledgeable image.The greatest taboo in the guidance of one's student is to impart incomplete knowledge. When your pail of knowledge is only half-full, it is easy for one's student's cultivation to go berserk through misguidance.Yesterday, Zhang Xuan was here twice and both times, he was only casually flipping through the manuals. Given his speed, he probably doesn't even remember the names of the book, needless to say remembering them. What else can his actions represent, other than his pursuit of vanity?The Compendium Pavilion is a location for teachers to research and study at. How can such a person be allowed entry!\u201cI pursue vanity and enjoy the pleasures of the illusion?\u201d Zhang Xuan blinks and confusion could be seen in his eyes.Why would he say such words?He couldn't resist asking, \u201cElder Mo, I am really here to learn and not to create trouble\u2026\u201dDa da da!Just as he is in the midst of clarifying the situation, footsteps could be heard from his back and an elegant voice sounds out.\u201cElder Mo, I will be going in to grab a few books!\u201dTurning around to take a look, it is the goddess teacher he met yesterday, Shen Bi Ru!At this current moment, Shen Bi Ru is dressed in light purple. Her slender body accompanied by her incredible figure and her flawless face brought out an exquisite and refined aura which radiates her surroundings.\u201cOh, it is Shen laoshi. Go on in!\u201d Seeing that it is her, Elder Mo doesn't even try to stop her in the least.Not only is Shen Bi Ru beautiful, she is also a reputable genius among the teachers. Despite being just 20 year old, she has already reached Fighter 5-dan pinnacle, just a step away from Pixue realm.\u201cThank you, Elder Mo!\u201d She nods her head elegantly. Turning around, she notices Zhang Xuan, who is just standing by the side, and couldn't help but to be a little surprised.In the past, although Zhang Xuan had never confessed to her, he would blush upon catching sight of her and would be unable to speak in front of her, bashful like a lady. Even the densest of people could tell that something was amiss.Initially, she thought that this would be the case this time as well. However, he only takes a glance at her before turning around, the adoration he held for her in the past totally absent in those clear eyes of his that resemble the pure spring water, as though he is completely immune to her beauty.The most important point of all is that Zhang Xuan isn't strong, and he scored badly for his Teacher Qualification Examination as well. As a result, he would always feel inferior upon seeing other teachers, causing him possess an unconfident disposition from his lack of self-esteem. However, at this moment, just by standing there, he looks dignified with the aura of an extraordinary person. Just by looking at his disposition itself, he is a completely different person from how he was in the past.Recalling the situation when they met yesterday, he even dared to refute Shang Bin straight on. Shen Bi Ru couldn't help but feel bewildered. When did that awkward young man who had an inferiority complex change so much?\u201cElder Mo, I am also here to browse through the books. Why is she allowed to enter while I am denied entry?\u201d Zhang Xuan is oblivious to the thoughts of the other party and could only gesture helplessly.Despite being both teachers, he is discriminated even in the privilege to browse through books. What ill luck!\u201cShen laoshi is entering the pavilion to study. As for what you are going in for, you should be more than aware of it! Do you still need me to point it out for you?\u201d Elder Mo harrumphs coldly.\u201cThere are only manuals inside, what else could I be doing inside?\u201d With a bitter smile, Zhang Xuan shakes his head. \u201cOf course I am entering the pavilion to read books and to enhance my knowledge!\u201d\u201cEnhance your knowledge? Hmph!\u201d Elder Mo is displeased.Flipping through books non-stop, not even stopping in the midst to read through them properly and you call it studying? Every single cultivation technique inside is incomparably precious. You can't possibly expect to enhance your knowledge by leaps and bounds just by flipping through tons of books without even jotting down notes! How could you possibly study like this?\u201cElder Mo!\u201dJust as he is about to continue explaining, Shen Bi Ru smiles faintly, her smile reminiscent of the blooming of a flower, as she says, \u201cZhang laoshi might really be here to learn. So, why don't you just let him enter! If he were to be stopped here like this, it wouldn't leave a good impression on the other teachers!\u201d\u201cUn! Since Shen laoshi pleaded on your account, I will allow you to enter. However, I will tell you in advance first. If you want to look through the books, look through them properly. If I see you wandering around in there and putting up a show, just wait and see how I will punish you!\u201dElder Mo gestures.\u201cYou have my gratitude!\u201d Zhang Xuan nods his head, then cups his hand towards Shen Bi Ru to show his appreciation for her help before walking into the Compendium Pavilion.\u201cUn?\u201dInitially, Shen Bi Ru thought that since she helped him, he would make use of the opportunity to strike up a conversation with her. Yet, he simply turned around to leave, leaving Shen Bi Ru a little stunned.Although she is a little surprised, she didn't pay much heed to it and follows behind him into the Compendium Pavilion.It was just a casual whim of hers to help Zhang Xuan, there wasn't any special reason or intention behind her action. Since the other party didn't want to chat with her, she is also happy to be spared the conversation.\u201cTo think that coming into the Compendium Pavilion would be so troublesome. The next time, I probably won't be able to enter anymore!\u201dStanding in front of the bookshelves, Zhang Xuan did not rush to flip through the books and instead, scratches his head.He didn't know why did Elder Mo stop him, but he is sure that it has something to do with his identity as the worst teacher in the academy.The identity is awkward no matter where he goes. Not just on the recruitment of students, even his colleagues despise him. The main reason why he is able to enter this time is thanks to Shen Bi Ru's words. However, what about the next time?\u201cThis Compendium Pavilion isn't very big anyway. If I hurry up, I might be able to browse through it all within today! This way, I won't need to enter the next time!\u201dSuddenly, a thought flashes through his mind.Since Elder Mo is determined to stop him, he should just make it so that he would not need to come anymore in the future.Given the size of the library, there are hundreds of thousands of books in here. Even if one were to spend their entire lives here, they probably wouldn't be able to finish reading through them. However, he is different! No matter what kind of books it is, as long as he flips through it, he would be able to compile an identical book of it in the Library of Heaven's Path with its flaws recorded in it!If he were to move quickly, it shouldn't be impossible for him to imprint all of these books into his head within a single day.Once he succeeds, he wouldn't need to go through so much trouble to come here to look for books.\u201cBegin!\u201dThe moment the thought pops into his mind, Zhang Xuan doesn't dawdle any longer and immediately walks towards the first bookshelf.Not concerned with what books they are, he casually grabs a handful of them and huala, flips through them.Hu hu hu!Just as he expected, the Library of Heaven's Path jolts and an identical book as the one in his hands appears on the bookshelf in it.\u201cUn, that's the way to go!\u201dAfter realizing that it is possible to compile multiple books simultaneously, he walks forward and grabs several books at once and imprints them into his head concurrently.Hualala! Hualala!The sound of footsteps and flipping of books echoes in the Compendium Pavilion.\u201cThat fellow, he still dares to claim otherwise\u2026 that he isn't putting on a show in pursuit for vanity?\u201dElder Mo, who is outside guarding the library, has been paying attention to Zhang Xuan from the moment he enters the library. The previous time, that fellow only flipped through a book at a time before putting it back. Although it is clear to see that he isn't really serious about it, at least it still looks acceptable. Now, he is taking dozens of books at once and playing with them, placing it back in the shelves before he could even see the titles clearly.What the heck is he doing?Is he here to read books or to choose cabbage?Furthermore, after looking at the manuals which the other party is looking through, he feels a spell of giddiness.\"Cultivation of Wisteria\"\u3001\"Basics to the Relationship of a Male and Female\",\"The Way of Amalgamating Yin and Yang\",\"Refining Green Emerald Pill\" and \"The Important Aspects One Should Take Note of in Forging Equipment\"\u2026There are books on all kinds of fields.Cultivation technique, battle technique, cultivation of medical herbs\u2026 even on male-female relationship\u2026 As long as it is a book, there is nothing that this fellow would not flip through!Everyone has their own shortcomings and merits and there are limits to a person's energy. It is impossible for one to master every single field. Thus, one has to choose properly on which book they should look through. However, this fellow flips through every single book without any hesitation. Is he sure that he isn't here to create trouble?\u201cHe must be here to cause trouble! When he leaves, I will make sure to teach him a lesson!\u201dElder Mo's face darkens as he harrumphs coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: You Must Be Sick!Translator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Un?\"Shen Bi Ru, who is the Compendium Pavilion as well, hears the continuous sounds of footsteps and flipping of books. Initially, she didn't think much into but as time passed, she started to feel that something is amiss with the situation.One would need to read a book slowly to comprehend its contents. How can it be possible for anyone to flip through it so quickly?Bewildered, she couldn't resist walking over to take a look.After which, she sees Zhang Xuan flipping the books from the first shelf. It is very apparent to see that he isn't reading through the contents of the books, but more like looking for something!\"Is this the reason why Elder Mo denied him entry?\"After watching for a moment, she realizes that the other party doesn't have the intention to stop. Gedeng, Shen Bi Ru's heart beats.Previously, the reason why she couldn't resist speaking out to help him upon seeing the difference between the current him and his previous self is because she wants him to work hard so as to be freed from his current awkward position.However, she would have never imagined that this fellow isn't here to study but to look for something!This is the Compendium Pavilion. Every day, there are innumerable teachers who come in, so it is impossible for there to be anything valuable hidden here. Flipping through these books so casually is almost a blasphemy to this Compendium Pavilion.How repulsive!\"Perhaps... He knew that I would be coming to the Compendium Pavilion today, so he intentionally waited outside then came in to make such a ruckus to capture my attention... Hmph, this would only provoke my ire!\"The image of the young man in Shen Bi Ru's heart falls to the pits.Due to her beauty, many people have tried many ways to get on her good side, as well as to attract her attention. In her opinion, Zhang Xuan isn't even trying to look through the books. Rather, he is intentionally making those noises to change her opinion of him.In reality, she hates it when people make up this kind of show.After looking at her a moment longer, she ascertains her opinion.If he is truly here to browse through the books, how could he possibly be reading books of all genres? Furthermore, to be flipping through them at such rapid speed, he is probably unable to even ascertain the name of the manual, needless to say, its contents.\"Hmph!\"With a darkened expression on her beautiful face, she walks over to Zhang Xuan, \"Zhang laoshi, what are you doing?\"\"Reading books!\"Zhang Xuan doesn't realize that his actions have already been labeled as 'putting up a show' and replies casually without raising his head.\"Reading books? Hmph!\" Shen Bi Ru harrumphs coldly. Coldness emanates from her jade-like face as she says, \"If you think that your actions are cool and would attract my attention, please retract those immature thoughts of yours. I, Shen Bi Ru, do not fall for such petty tricks. Furthermore, your actions will only incur my irritation!\"\"Oh! Alright!\"Zhang Xuan continues flipping through his books.He intends to imprint all of the manuals in the Compendium Pavilion onto the Library of Heaven's Path by today and time is a little tight for him, so he doesn't have the effort to spare to be chatting with others.Besides, in his opinion, the other party is simply being too 'self-important'. What does business does she have to do with what he is doing?You might be truly pretty, but it isn't like I have yet to meet a beautiful woman like you. In the previous world, in the era of information, there are all kinds of beauties stored in the hard disk. Furthermore, they are skilled in blowing, pulling, playing and singing... A cold beauty like you does not hold much interest to me!I don't have the energy to think of ways to attract your attention.\"Since you understand it, please leave this Compendium Library. Stop wasting your effort here!\" Seeing how the young man's head remains lowered, still putting on a show, Shen Bi Ru turns and gestures him to leave.Deng deng deng deng!The sound of the footsteps of the young man leaving.\"This is more like it...\"Seeing how he gives up readily, Shen Bi Ru nods her head in satisfaction. Just as she is about to continue to read her book, she hears the sound of the flipping of books echoing in the library once again.Hualala! Hualalala!Turning her head to take a look, she realizes that the young man had no intention to leave.\"You...\"Shen Bi Ru almost explodes from anger.Are you done yet?I have already said that doing this will just incur my irritation, yet you still persist in doing so. Is there a point to it?At this point, her slim figure straightens and she walks up to Zhang Xuan once again, and disgust could be clearly seen in her pitch black pupils, \"Did you not hear my words? The more you behave like this, the more disgusted I would be with you! You won't earn my fancy like this!\"\"Are you sick?\"Seeing the other party coming over to bother him again, Zhang Xuan is a little irritated. He stops in his actions and says, \"You read your own stuff while I'll read my own. If you are really bored, you can squat by a corner and draw circles. Don't bother me here!\"It is not like I have never met a beautiful lady in my life before, why are you acting so haughtily!\"You...\"She didn't expect the young man to speak like this. Shen Bi Ru feels her sight blurring and she almost dies from the overwhelming rage welling in her.Who is she?Hongtian Academy's number 1 beauty. Blessed with great talent and looks, almost all of the teachers and students in the academy regard her as a goddess. Before her, they would act respectfully, not daring to even speak loudly for fear of offending her.Yet, you dare to say... I am sick?Even asking me to squat at a corner to draw circles?I am a lady, alright? Draw circles, draw your mum's fat head!Shen Bi Ru feels a heavy and stuffy sensation on her chest that she is unable to relieve.Hualala! Hualalala!Her face flushes red from anger. Just as she is about to reprimand the other party, she realizes that the young man has gone back to flipping through the books after being done with his words, not even sparing her an additional glance.\"Fine, fine! Continue putting on an act! See how I will reveal your true colors!\"Luoluo, Shen Bi Ru grits her teeth tightly and stomps her leg.This is the first time that a man has talked to her in such a manner!Fine, aren't you putting on an act of browsing through the books now? Let's see how long you can put up with it. When you are finally unable to continue on, I will expose you and leave you embarrassed!Then, Shen Bi Ru no longer bothers herself with Zhang Xuan and instead, angrily walks back to the manual she had looked for previously and casually takes it out. Then, sitting in a corner in the room, she starts copying it down.Initially, her mood was quite good today and she intended to study for quite awhile to boost her knowledge. Yet, never in her dreams would she expect to meet such an infuriating fellow.In the midst of copying down her notes, she sneaks glances periodically towards him.The young man still continues flipping through all of the books with the same speed, seemingly adamant to leave no book unturned. It seems that as long as it is a book of the Compendium Pavilion, he would surely flip through it once.\"Hmph! Let's see how long you can keep up the act for!\"After being rebuked by Zhang Xuan, Shen Bi Ru no longer retains her calmness from before and she intends to make things difficult for him. As she copies down her notes slowly, she waits for the moment when the other party is unable to keep up with the act.However, what that leaves her bewildered is that the young man repeats his actions over and over again with the same astonishing speed. From the very first bookshelf, he moves from one row to another, flipping through the books, from afternoon to night, not even sparing a single minute to rest!It has already been six to seven hours but yet the fellow is still persisting on with the same motion. Even Shen Bi Ru finds it inconceivable at this point.If his aim was to attract her attention, she has already clearly told him that she detests such actions, so he should have stopped then. So, how is it possible for him to continue flipping through like this? Not to mention, for such a long period of time?\"Could this fellow's brain be convulsing or something? Has his cultivation went berserk and he himself became insane?\"Suddenly, a thought pops up in her head.She has heard that when one's cultivation goes berserk, one would start to do many abnormal actions. Could it be that flipping through books non-stop here be one of this kind of abnormal actions?She is looking at the young man with a bizarre expression as she starts to think that the young man is abnormal when she notices that Zhang Xuan stopping in his actions after flipping through the books in the final row.\"So much knowledge!\"After a consecutive six to seven hours of hard work, he has finally imprinted all of the books in Hongtian Academy's Teacher Compendium Pavilion in the Library of Heaven's Path in his head.Through the compilation of flaws and strengths from the Library of Heaven's Path towards each individual book, he gains a certain level of understanding towards the cultivation technique, battle technique, pills, equipment forging, formations and such.\"With Zhao Ya's Pure Yin Body, she should cultivate this manual. However, before that, I have to do some preparations...\"After imprinting the entire Compendium Pavilion, he finally understands how he should solve the problem with Zhao Ya's physical body. He couldn't resist heaving a breath of relief. He has even found out the loopholes and incomplete portions in the previous 3 dan of his cultivation. As long as he finds some time to re-cultivate through them, he can correct and perfect them.\"Gugugu!\"When he is finally finished, he feels an ache in his stomach. After working for such a long period of time, his hunger pangs has already long struck, just that he was oblivious to it then.Shaking his head, he starts to walk towards the exit of the Compendium Pavilion. However, he had only taken a few steps when he sees Shen Bi Ru standing before him, looking at him with a cold gaze.To think that this woman would still be here after he has flipped through the books for six to seven hours.Can't be bothered with such a 'self-important' fellow, Zhang Xuan continues walking towards the exit of the Compendium Pavilion.\"Stop it right there!\"When he has just walked through the exit, he hears Elder Mo bellowing at him.At this very instant, Elder Mo's face darkens to the point that it seems like the coalescence of numerous storm clouds, ready to explode at any moment.He has tolerated this young man for very long!At this moment, there is only a thought in his head. Troublemaker, troublemaker, and troublemaker!\"Elder Mo!\"Zhang Xuan looks at him with a puzzled expression.\"Hmph, Zhang Xuan laoshi!\" Elder Mo's face is cold. With an intentionally harsher tone, he says, \"You came to the Compendium Pavilion not to study, but to intentionally cause trouble! From now on, the Compendium Pavilion no longer welcomes you. If you step in here once more, I will break your legs!\"\"Causing trouble? Elder Mo, where did all these come from? I have been looking through the books seriously, how did I become a troublemaker?\"Although he had already duplicated an identical Compendium Pavilion in his head and no longer has to come here, he still feels displeased upon hearing those words.Why is it that when other people are here, you think of them as studying, but when I am here, you think of me as a troublemaker?What kind of logic is this?Aren't you being too unreasonable!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tell me, who reads the way you do?\u201d\u201cMust reading involve jotting down notes to decipher its contents?\u201d Only now does Zhang Xuan understand why the other party is so mad. He is at a loss to respond.In his previous life, he was a librarian and his job scope was similar to that of Elder Mo's. However, back then, as long as one holds a borrowing pass, he would be able to enter the premises and no one would bother whether he is eating or drinking inside. As long as one doesn't kill someone or set the place on fire, he is basically free to do as he pleases!Initially, he thought that Elder No was making things difficult for him due to his previous self's astounding results at the Teacher Qualification Examination. After such a farce, the reason ends up to be just this!\u201cThese books are obtained through the relentless efforts of the academy's predecessor and every single one of them is the product of their blood, sweat and tears. If you are not here to study, then don't touch them! Flipping through them the way you do, what can you be doing other than creating trouble?\u201d Elder Mo flings his hands in anger.\u201cI\u2026 Fine, if you insist that I'm creating trouble, then just take it to be so!\u201dZhang Xuan wants to explain but after thinking it through for a moment, he shakes his head and decides otherwise.The matter with the Library of Heaven's Path must not be revealed. This also means that he would be unable to explain his actions of flipping through those books frenziedly.Since he won't be here in the future anyway, there is no need for him to clarify it. Besides, his reputation is already as bad as it is, it doesn't matter whether it is sullied further or not.\u201cAt least you're willing to admit to it! Now, scram!\u201d Upon his admittance, intense loathe can be seen in Elder Mo's eyes. He waves his hands, gesturing him to leave.\u201cI'll be taking my leave!\u201dJust as he is about to leave, a pleasant aroma surges into his surroundings and a figure appears before him. Blocking his path, Shen Bi Ru says, \u201cWait a minute!\u201d\u201cWhat is it now?\u201d Zhang Xuan looks at her helplessly. \u201cYou read your own book while I read mine. Surely I didn't bother you then!\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dNormally, when she stops someone else, the other party would be leaping in joy. Yet, this fellow looks at her with an annoyed expression. Shen Bi Ru frowns, \u201cIt isn't about that. Didn't you say that you were reading books in there? After reading for such a long period, surely you would remember some of its contents!\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201dNot sure what kind of tricks this woman is playing now, Zhang Xuan stares at her doubtfully.\u201cIt's simple. I noticed that you read \u300aEight Methods of Pill Refinement\u300b. It just happens that there are some parts of it that I am unable to comprehend so I would like to consult you on it. Surely you won't reject my request?\u201d Shen Bi Ru asks.Actually, her plan is simple. Isn't this fellow before her putting on an act by flipping through all those books?Thus, if she questions him on the book and he is unable to answer her queries, his lie will be exposed!\u201cEight Methods of Pill Refinement?\u201d Zhang Xuan's consciousness jolts as the book appears in his mind. Indeed, he had flipped through this book previously. \u201cIf there's anything you are unsure of, feel free to ask and I will answer your queries. However, I have to eat soon and don't have much time to spare, so do hurry up\u2026\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dClenching her fists tightly, Shen Bi Ru almost faints from anger.His tone is as though a frustrated teacher answering the questions of a student seeking clarification.Firstly, I am a beauty. Secondly, I am a high-level teacher and one of the popular teachers of the school! If I ask you a question, it is obvious that I am testing your standards. Why does it sound like I am learning from you?Everyone has a field of specialty that expertise in, so teachers in the academy often consult one another to learn from each other. However, as a fellow who scored zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination, what makes you think that you are qualified for me to be consulting you?Suppressing the rage within her that is on the verge of erupting, Shen Bi Ru grinds her teeth, \u201cJust a moment ago, I read a phrase in the book 'If the herbs scatter, it would be difficult for the pill to form! If the herbs agglutinate, a yellow pill will form!' I find these words a little bizarre and incomprehensible. Can Zhang laoshi clarify its meaning for me?\u201dWhen she says the word 'clarify', her teeth almost shatter from the intense force between them, and the sound of its grinding is clear to hear.As a great beauty, if it isn't to embarrass him, she would never seek guidance from a trash.\u201cYou still want to ask questions despite that memory of yours\u2026\u201d He didn't expect the other party to ask such a question. He purses his lips and replies, \u201cThe phrase should be 'If the herbs agglutinate, it would be difficult for the pill to form! If the herbs scatter, a yellow pill will form!' Its meaning is simple. When refining a pill, the moment that the herbal fluid or powder clumps together, it would be impossible to meld their medical properties together. On the other hand, if they are separated and mixed together thoroughly, the pill that would be formed will look like the yellows of an egg!\u201dAfter flipping through all of the books in the Compendium Pavilion, he is able to retrieve the correct method for the refinement of the pill with just a jolt of his consciousness. She might be able to stump others with such a question, but directing it towards him? What a joke!What's worst is that\u2026 She even recited the question wrongly! Her standard is too sub-par!\u201cHow, you can't reply it, can you! Ah\u2026 What did you say?\u201dShe thought that the young man would be unable to reply her question. Not even in her dreams would she fathom that Zhang Xuan would be able to answer the question so casually. Unprepared for such a twist, Shen Bi Ru is dumbfounded, her beautiful eyes almost popping out of their sockets.She intentionally recited the phrase wrongly so that he would offer the wrong guidance. In her viewpoint, this fellow was just making up a show in the Compendium Pavilion, not absorbing the slightest bit of knowledge in those book at all. If she were to casually whip out the contents of a book, he would be foreign to them!Thus, she recited it inaccurately so that he would make a fool of himself!Who knew that\u2026 he would see through her inaccurate reciting and even offered the most correct answer!How\u2026 How is this possible?Could it be that this fellow has really remembered the entirety of \u300aEight Methods of Pill Refinement\u300b just by flipping through it?But that's impossible!He is a fellow who scored zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination, how could he possibly be knowledgeable in something as unconventional as pill refining?\u201cAlright, do you have any other questions?\u201d Stroking his shriveled stomach, Zhang Xuan hurries her.\u201cI still have more!\u201d Despite the overwhelming shock, upon seeing the impassive look on his face, Shen Bi Ru immediately recovers and poses another question, \u201cThere is another phrase that I don't understand. 'When refining a metal in flames, never meld them when it is impure!\u201dAfter finishing her words, she smiles coldly as she awaits for the stumped look on the other party.The question she asked previously was on pill refinement while this one is a dictum on weapon forging. This is a phrase she saw on an ancient book. She was unable to understand the saying ever after analyzing it for a month. In the end, she only managed to clarify it after consulting a master blacksmith!Initially, she only wanted to embarrass the other party to let him know the price of offending her. Yet, she didn't expect him to be able to explain the meaning of the words in the Eight Methods of Pill Refinement!This provoked the competitive spirit within her, inducing her to come up with a difficult question to leave him speechless.\u201cThis\u2026\u201dStanding by the side, Elder Mo was surprised when Zhang Xuan was able to answer the first question. Even so, he wasn't particularly shocked.Eight Methods of Pill Refinement is a basic manual that innumerable rookie apothecaries would have to learn, similar to what Hongtian Nine Dan Formula is to cultivators. Even if one doesn't learn pill refinement, it isn't peculiar for them to know a thing or two about it.When Shen Bi Ru asked the second question, he is stunned. That's because even he found it hard to decipher the meaning of these words.\u201cWhen refining a metal in flames, never meld them when it is impure!\u201d Just when the two of them thought that he would be incapable of answering, Zhang Xuan shakes his head and looks at Shen Bi Ru as though he is looking at an idiot. \u201cWhat is so hard to comprehend about these words? It just means that when forging weapons, one must first refine the respective materials in fire to thoroughly to clear away all impurities. Only then can the weapon be melded together more effectively! May I trouble you to ask some harder questions? This basic knowledge can be grasped easily after reading more books!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dShen Bi Ru's slim body jolts.She had to consult many different people before she got an answer to this question of hers. Yet, this young man managed to point out the crux of the dictum instantly, this\u2026Not just her, even Elder Mo almost faints from astonishment.For Zhang Xuan to answer a question he didn't know the answer to, could it be that\u2026 he was studying seriously when he was flipping through all those books?\u201cZhang Xuan laoshi, your answer seems to be incorrect though. I remember that there is an explanation of it on \u300aDiscussions of Miscellaneous Disputes\u300b which is different from what you claim. It states that if one wants to add metal material to a pill, one would have to refine it first, otherwise it would not coagulate as one!\u201dIn a state of disbelief, Elder Mo speaks up.\u201cYou remembered it wrongly, there isn't such a phrase in \u300aDiscussions of Miscellaneous Disputes\u300b, neither is there anything of that sort written in it. The one you read must be \u300aDiscussion of Miscellaneous Theories\u300b written by senior Liu Ze. There is a phrase similar to it in there, but what that is written is 'When refining a metal along with a pill, never mix them when it is impure', and not refining a metal in flames!\u201dZhang Xuan waves his hand majestically.He isn't aware that the both of them are testing him. He truly thought that the both of them couldn't remember the contents clearly and thus, he casually continues, \u201cOh, this book is at the corner of the 9th row in the Compendium Pavilion. The words that you just said are recorded on the 49th page! As for the question Shen laoshi just asked, if you hold doubts about my explanation, you can browse through \u300aThree Arts of Fire Crafting\u300b left behind by senior Du Qu. It is by the corner of the 15th bookshelf and the explanation of it is written on the 24th page!\u201d\u201cLet me take a look!\u201dShen Bi Ru looks at him with doubtful eyes. She hurriedly rushes back into the Compendium Pavilion and in a short moment, she comes back with two books in her hand, \u300aDiscussion of Miscellaneous Theories\u300b and \u300aThree Arts of Fire Crafting\u300b. Flipping to the page that the latter said, she staggers and almost passes out on the spot.To think that it would be\u2026 identical to what Zhang Xuan said, there is not even a single discrepancy!Not only did he remember the contents of the book, he could even point out which book it came from, its location and even the page number?Is this for real?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Heart of Tranquil WaterTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexHeart of Tranquil WaterGrabbing hold of the book from Shen Bi Ru, Elder Mo takes a glance at it and his entire body trembles.This\u2026 should be impossible!\u201cAlright, is there still anything you are unsure of that you would like to consult? If not, I'll be leaving!\u201d Zhang Xuan looks at them with puzzlement reflecting on his face.Are these two fellows sick?!If they wanted to consult him, they should have come up with some harder questions. Yet, they chose to ask those that have been answered within the books. He didn't even have to churn his brain to derive out an answer for them. How boring.To think that one of them is a librarian and an expert while the other one is a reputable and popular teacher\u2026 Pui! To be unable to match up to a transcender like me, they are truly lacking in knowledge!\u201cIf you don't mind, I have another question that has been plaguing me. How would you interpret 'Circulating a cycle of qi, reflecting the sight of ten thousand creations'?\u201dSuppressing the disbelief in his mind, Elder Mo continues to ask.Another elder has raised this question with him a few days ago. After being stumped by it, he has been scavenging the Compendium Pavilion to seek an answer to it, but to no avail. Thus, he could only depart from the library dispirited. Now that the young lad before him had answered several questions, he couldn't resist bringing it up to him.\u201cYou don't even know that?\u201d Zhang Xuan looks at him as though he is looking at an idiot. \u201cThat is the utmost basics of cultivation, alright? It refers to the phenomenon where while one's qi is circulating through one's body in a complete cycle, one's mind would seem to be in a state of wandering around the entire world as they comprehend the rules behind creationism! These words are recorded in senior Bai Ming's \u300aTheories of Blood and Qi\u300b. The book is on the 27th shelf and the explanation is on the 69th page!\u201d'Circulating a cycle of qi, reflecting the sight of ten thousand creations', this is one of the few flawless teachings that are in the Fighter 1-dan cultivation technique manuals, thus it left quite an impression with Zhang Xuan. It happens that a predecessor of Hongtian Academy had once deciphered it, so he paid additional notice to it. Why would an elder, who is the sentinel of the Compendium Library, need to direct such an easy question towards him?Elder Mo didn't reply to his words immediately and instead, just like Shen Bi Ru, walks into the Compendium Pavilion hurriedly. A short moment later, he finds the book titled \u300aTheories of Blood and Qi\u300b and flips it over to the 69th page. His body staggers.It is exactly as he described!A few days ago, that elder flipped through many different secret manuals but couldn't find an answer to his question. Never in his dreams would he have imagined that it would be recorded in an obscure book!Such an obscure book\u2026 To think that he would have read it, to the extent of even remembering\u2026 the pages?Elder Mo feels the world spinning around him and everything seems so ludicrous to him in this instant.If it isn't for his consideration for his image, he might be tugging on the ends of his hair at this moment.A moment ago, he accused the other party of causing trouble in the library. In the end, not only is he reading books properly, he even memorized the contents contained within it. He feels a fiery sting on his face and fervently wishes for a burrow to appear so that he could hide in it.Is he really the same teacher who scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination?If Zhang Xuan could be the last with such a level of knowledge, doesn't this mean that he isn't even qualified to get zero marks?\u201cAlright. In the future, read more books. The answers to the questions that you have posed are all recorded in them!\u201d Seeing their stunned expressions, Zhang Xuan lectures them with a deep tone. Then, he shakes his head and says, \u201cIf there is nothing else, I'll be leaving!\u201dAfter saying those words, he lifts his legs to walk away.He is simply way too hungry. If he doesn't get food anytime soon, he might really faint from starvation.\u201cZhang Xuan laoshi, wait for me\u2026\u201dOnly now does Shen Bi Ru recover from her shock and she swiftly catches up with Zhang Xuan.\u201cWhat else do you want?\u201d Zhang Xuan says in a slightly annoyed tone.Is this woman sick or something?I had already clarified your queries for you! Are you done yet? Can't you see that I am hungry and would like to eat?\u201cI have yet to eat as well. Do you want to share a meal with me?\u201d Shen Bi Ru grits her teeth.She is the Aphrodite of the academy. Many men had asked her out for a meal, only to be rejected by her. She had not even accepted a single one of the innumerable meal dates from Shang Bin.The shock that this young man generated in her today made her curious about him, thus she decided to ask him out so as to make use of the opportunity to see what is it that caused the changes in him.\u201cYou want me to treat you?\u201d Zhang Xuan looks at her with a bizarre expression. \u201cWhat are you thinking of! If you want to eat, use your own money! How can one's skin be so thick?\u201dYou had questions for me, so I answered them for you. You still expect me to treat you after that?How can you be so shameless?In his previous life, he had researched numerous 'action films', but even so, he is a true shut-in. He had never truly come in contact with the opposite gender before, so how could he understand the thoughts of a lady?\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Seeing the gaze of the young man and hearing his words, Shen Bi Ru almost shoots out a mouthful of blood and faints.I am a beautiful lady, alright? Beautiful ladies have special privileges!So many people had invited me out and I turned down every single one of them. Yet, when I ask you out, you look at me as though I am a monster\u2026Shameless?!Shameless your head!Is there anyone in the world who would term a beautiful lady as such?The lady is on the verge of going berserk.\u201cFine, I'll treat you, okay? I'll treat you!\u201d Grinding her silver teeth together, Shen Bi Ru spits out these words.\u201cYou treat me?\u201d Zhang Xuan pauses for a moment. Due to his previous self being the worst teacher in the academy, his income is nearly negligible. As such, it isn't a bad thing to have someone treat him. Thus, he nods his head, \u201cIt's fine with me, but I want a luxurious meal. I won't eat just any ordinary mantous and fried pancakes!\u201dMantou -> BunBasically, he means he won't just eat street food/ from vendors by the street.\u201c\u2026\u201dShen Bi Ru goes berserk again.Mantou and fried pancakes? The heck with it!\u201cLet's go!\u201d She doesn't want to say anything anymore. She's afraid that if she continues talking to him, she would die from anger.The Library of Heaven's Path allows him to see through the flaws of all skills and everyone's mingmen. However, it is unable to peer into the heart of a lady. Zhang Xuan is oblivious to the fact that he had made Hongtian Academy's number one beauty furious to the point of vomiting blood with just a few simple words of his.Following behind Shen Bi Ru, Zhang Xuan walks along the pavement towards the entrance of the campus.Although the night scenery at Hongtian Academy isn't as radiant as the school in his previous life, it is still quite an exquisite sight under the illumination of the moon. Shrouded by spirit energy, the atmosphere seems exceptionally tranquil and peaceful.In his previous life, he was surrounded by hubble-bubble and smog could be found everywhere. It was very different from the serenity one could experience here. Zhang Xuan subconsciously immerses himself in this enchanting scenery.Walking in front, Shen Bi Ru thought that the young man following behind her would intentionally ask some questions to break the awkward silence. However, after the absence of sound for a long period of time, she couldn't resist turning around to take a look.Sneaking a glance, she is taken aback.The young man walks quietly as the moonlight illuminates his figure, the image of it reminiscent of a serene painting.\u201cThis\u2026 This\u2026 Will of Mind 2-dan, Heart of Tranquil Water?\u201dHer eyes narrow.Fighters don't just cultivate their zhenqi and physical body. What is even more crucial to them is their mind!The stronger one's mind is, the greater control they have over their cultivation. As a result, one's cultivation can surge even more swiftly, thus allowing them to reach greater heights in the future.That's precisely the reason why experts classified the Will of Mind into many different levels.Heart of Tranquil Water is the 2-dan realm of it!The mind is harder to train than battle techniques. It is said that of the entire academy, only the principal has reached such a level. Even Shen Bi Ru, who is reputed to possess unparalleled talents and has reached Fighter 5-dan pinnacle by the age of 20, second only to the renowned young genius Bai wangye, is still a long way away from Will of Mind 2-dan.Wangye -> Prince (More is explained below)Initially, she thought that it would be too difficult for a second person to reach such a level, but never in her dreams would she dare to think that the trash teacher in the mouths of others would actually reach such heights!If not for the fact that she witnessed it personally, she would never believe it!How is this possible?That is Will of Mind 2-dan! It is a height harder to climb to than Fighter 6-dan 7-dan!\u201cCould it be that\u2026 He isn't a trash at all, but he\u2026 intentionally scored a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination so as to make use of the insults and derision of others to temper his will?\u201dSuddenly, a peculiar thought pops up in her mind.In the past, she didn't have much contact with Zhang Xuan laoshi, so she isn't really aware of his affairs. Today, through their conversation, she realized that he is not only knowledgeable, he even reached Will of Mind 2-dan Heart of Tranquil Water!That is a level many dream about, but never achieved in their lifetime!Looks like his Teacher Qualification Examination results are all feigned. His true goal is to make use of the scorn of others to train his mind, so as to break into the Will of Mind 2-dan.She finds it unbelievable that a person with such Will of Mind would be unable to achieve a pass in the simple Teacher Qualification Examination.\u201cHmph, continue putting on an act. See how I'll expose you!\u201dThinking about how she was duped by this fellow, she grits her silver teeth tightly.This fellow is simply too hateful. She is resolute to look for a chance to expose him before others!Wangye is a title granted from the emperor to princes of the country.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32: Hongtian PavilionTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\u201cHeart of Tranquil Water?\u201dVery quickly, Zhang Xuan's consciousness returns from a mystical spiritual world and his eyes light up.Having read so many books, it is natural that he would understand the significance of the Will of Mind.\u201cI am a transcender. Having experienced life and death, it is natural that my will would be stronger than most. Furthermore, I cultivate in Heaven's Path Divine Art, so my zhenqi is as pure as clear water! It is normal to reach Will of Mind 2-dan so quickly!\u201dHe is overjoyed over it, but it didn't come as a surprise.If he were to still be like the other ordinary folks when he possesses the godly tool named Library of Heaven's Path, he might as well buy a blob of tofu and commit suicide on it.Remaining silent the entire way, they soon arrive at the entrance of the academy.\u201cHongtian Pavilion!\u201dSeeing the two enormous words before him, Zhang Xuan nods his head.There are recollections of this tavern in the memories of his previous self. Hongtian Pavilion is the most luxurious tavern in Hongtian Academy. Every single meal here would blow a hole in one's wallet. Due to his meager pay, his previous self had never been here before.Initially, he thought that Shen Bi Ru would just bring him to some casual restaurant. He never thought that she would be so generous to bring him here.As expected of a renowned tavern. The furnishings inside are majestic. Numerous Night Illumination Pearls of the size of a fist are embedded within the walls of the tavern, making it seem as though it is still daytime.They sit down at a table beside the windows.\u201cWhat would you like?\u201d Shen Bi Ru gazes at the young man before her.\u201cAnything!\u201d Zhang Xuan gestures. \u201cSince you're the one treating, I will eat anything that you order!\u201dNever been here before, he doesn't know what dishes are good here. Since someone else is paying, he couldn't be bothered to think about itSeeing the expression of the young man which seems resolute to take advantage of her wealth, Shen Bi Ru feels her rage welling up. However, as this isn't a good situation for her to flare up, she can only nod her head and casually order a few dishes.\u201cZhang laoshi, was the zero in your Teacher Qualification Examination intentional?\u201dAfter ordering, Shen Bi Ru stares at the young man before her fixedly.\u201cIntentional?\u201d Unsure of why the latter would ask such a question, Zhang Xuan pauses for a moment before replying, \u201cOf course not!\u201dBack then, during the period of the Teacher Qualification Examination, he had yet to transcend over, and his previous self didn't possess the Library of Heaven's Path either. Thus, it is impossible for the results to just be an act!Knowing that he would deny it, Shen Bi Ru laughs coldly in her mind.Denying it? See how I will expose your true colors!\u201cSince we're free now, I happen to have some questions that I have been unable to answer. Zhang laoshi, would you mind helping me clarify my doubts?\u201d An idea flashes through Shen Bi Ru's mind and she asks.\u201cGo ahead!\u201dSince the other party is treating him to a meal, he should answer a question or two of hers in return.\u201cAlright, if one is unable to gather spirit energy in their meridians while cultivating\u2026\u201d Shen Bi Ru ponders for a moment before asking a question.\u201cYou don't know this as well?\u201d Hearing that the question is even simpler than the ones from before, Zhang Xuan stares at the other party in bewilderment before casually explaining, \u201cI have nine methods here that can solve the problem\u2026\u201dSoon, he finishes his explanation.\u201cNine methods\u2026\u201d Hearing how the young man casually throws out nine methods at her, Shen Bi Ru's face warps.Despite being knowledgeable, she is only aware of three methods. Yet, the other party is able to list out nine in a single breath. Furthermore, there is a few in the mix that are completely foreign to her. She finds the entire situation inconceivable.\u201cThat\u2026 Then, what if one is unable to guide the flow of spirit energy into the meridians after absorbing it into one's body?\u201d Forcefully suppressing her astonishment, she asks once more.\u201cThat is simple too, I have eight ways of resolving that!\u201d Zhang Xuan starts to explain, \u201cFirstly\u2026\u201dShen Bi Ru's slim body trembles. She had prepared herself mentally for this, but she still finds the situation insane.The methods he brought up are incredible. If these were to spread out, it would cause an uproar in the world of cultivation!\u201cSince you know so many methods, why weren't you able to list a single one of them out during the Teacher Qualification Examination and instead, scored a zero?\u201dForcibly suppressing her shock, Shen Bi Ru asks.The two questions that she just raised were the exact same questions listed in the previous Teacher Qualification Examination. Since he is aware of so many solutions, why couldn't he fill them in? Not to mention, to end up with a zero?\u201cKeng?\u201d Only now does Zhang Xuan comes to a realization.So these questions were from the Teacher Qualification Examinations. As it is part of the memories of his previous self, although he found the questions familiar, he wasn't able to pinpoint exactly where he saw them.\u201cThat\u2026\u201dJust as he is stumped for an answer, the dishes that were ordered previously are placed on the table one after another.\u201cLet's eat first!\u201dLooking at the appearance of the dishes and taking in their fragrance, Zhang Xuan's appetite is whetted up. Cannot be bothered with these troublesome matters, he starts to dig in.\u201cHmph\u2026\u201dSeeing how that fellow is more delighted to see those delicacies than her, Shen Bi Ru pouts.Countless people had invited her out for a meal, using all kinds of reasons and excuses just to stay with her a moment longer. Yet, this fellow is here just for the meal itself\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cShang shaoye, don't be angry anymore. I have applied for the \u3010Enlightenment Will Trial\u3011 and the academy will bring Liu Yang over for inspection tomorrow. Zhang Xuan would definitely be severely punished! As for that lunatic, Elder Shang has already lent you his beloved pet. When you meet him tomorrow, you will surely be able to give him an unforgettable lesson, so you should be overjoyed instead! Let's go, I'll treat you to a grand meal to make up for the sufferings you underwent today. After which, we will find a few girls and\u2026 Hehe!\u201dShaoye -> Young masterTwo young men are walking along the pavement of the academy.The one leading in front has a swollen and bruised face with clear panda eyes. It is apparent to see that he had fought with someone and got hit on the face. The one following behind him has his body bent forward and is assuming a subservient attitude. The one who is speaking at the moment is the latter.There is a giant lion strutting proudly behind the two of them. Emanating a ferocious aura, it induces great pressure and fear in one before one could even approach it.They are Shang Bin, who created trouble in the classroom earlier in the morning, only to be beaten up by Yao Han, and Cao Xiong, who is desperate to get Zhang Xuan into deep trouble.As for the lion behind them, it is Elder Shang Chen's beloved pet, the tier 6 savage beast \u3010Sky Shattering Lion\u3011!In this world, there are apothecary, blacksmith and many other occupations. Every single occupation is noble in its own right and well-respected by the others.Of these occupations, Elder Shang Chen is a beast tamer.This occupation allows one to tame savage beasts and spirit beasts and control them, turning them into a part of one's fighting prowess. It is a formidable occupation that is noteworthy compared to the rest.This Sky Shattering Lion is a beast pet that Elder Shang Chen has trained.After being done in by the berserk Yao Han, he is aware that he is unable to match up to him in terms of strength. Thus, he approached his grandfather to borrow a beast pet for his usage.\u201cUn!\u201d Hearing those fawning words, Shang Bin nods his head as he spits with an aggressive expression, \u201cThat Yao Han must be taught a good lesson. Zhang Xuan as well!\u201d\u201cOf course. With this Sky Shattering Lion, what does Shang shaoye has to fear!\u201d Cao Xiong chuckles.A tier 6 savage beast is equivalent to a Fighter 6-dan expert, perhaps even surpassing them slightly.Even if that berserk butler Yao Han isn't weak, it won't be an easy feat for him to defeat the Sky Shattering Lion even in his top form, needless to say, in his current state.Earlier in the day, he was wrapped up like a mummy, not any better than Shang shaoye's current situation.\u201cSky Shattering Lion is my grandfather's beast pet. You are also aware of its wild nature, which makes it is a difficult pet to tame. Grandfather may have handed him over to me, but it would only make a move when someone attacks me. Currently, I am still incapable of ordering it around!\u201dLooking at the ferocious and mighty Sky Shattering Lion behind him, Shang Bin feels a little helpless.Savage beasts may be strong, but they are very proud lifeforms. Unless one is stronger than them or has the occupation of a beast tamer, it is impossible to make them listen to one's orders willingly.\u201cThat may not be necessarily so. If we entertain it with good alcohol and food, it might just listen to your commands!\u201dCao Xiong smiles.\u201cLet's hope that it'll be like that!\u201dIn the midst of their strolling and chattering, a massive tavern soon appears before them.\u201cWe're here!\u201dA magnificent signboard sits behind them as they walk into the tavern.Hongtian Pavilion!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: Feigning GenerosityTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Shang gongzi, you're here. Come on in!\"Gongzi -> Gentleman, usually used to address for young males.Before the two men and one beast step into the tavern, a smiling middle-aged man welcomes them with a smile.The manager of Hongtian Pavilion, Wu Chou!\"Give us a quiet location. Cao Xiong laoshi and I want to have a good drink together!\" Shang Bin says.\"Over here!\"Wu Chou quickly brings them to their seats.\"Shang shaoye, every time I am here, this Wu Chou would behave smugly and disregard my presence. This time, why does he...\" Cao Xiong couldn't resist asking.Hongtian Pavilion may just be a tavern, but the powers backing it is not one to scoff at. Otherwise, it is impossible for them to be operating their business in the compounds of Hongtian Academy at such a scale!In the past, when he was here to eat, manager Wu would always disregard him. Yet, this time, his back is bent forward and her attitude is of utmost respect. The disparity in his attitudes makes him doubt if he is in reality.\"You should have heard of that there was once an Elder Hong Hao in the academy!\" Shang Bin says.Cao Xiong nods his head.Hongtian Academy is founded by Hongtian. After his death, his descendants sustained his heritage. As a result, the elders who have the surname of 'Hong' tend to be of more esteemed standing in the academy.He has heard of this Elder Hong Hao previously. He is an extremely powerful individual and has once vied for the principal seat. However, afterward, for some unknown reasons, he suddenly resigned from his position as an elder and there was no news on him anymore.\"After resigning as an elder, he started a tavern. He used to be best buddies with my grandfather, so manager Wu would welcome me with respect whenever I'm here!\" Shang Bin declares gleefully.\"So that's the reason!\" Cao Xiong nods his head.No wonder this Hongtian Pavilion managed to grow to such a scale, it was opened by the previous Elder Hong Hao.To be received by the manager of such a huge tavern, it is definitely something glorious.\"Un?\"Just as he is in the midst of enjoying service he has never experienced before, Cao Xiong suddenly freezes and his face gradually grows darker.\"What happened?\"Shang Bin gazes at him in puzzlement.\"That should be Zhang Xuan, right? How could he possibly have the qualifications to be dining here?\" Cao Xiong points towards a table by the window.\"Zhang Xuan?\" Shang Bin glances over as well. Upon seeing the young man, he catches sight of the figure seated together with him. His eyebrows shoot upwards and rage surges from within. \"Why is she together with that trash? I had extended my invitation to her multiple times, but she kept rejecting me. To think that she would be dining with someone else! Damn it! Damn it!\"As the grandson of an elder, a high-level teacher of the academy and a Fighter 5-dan Dingli realm expert, he has invited Shen Bi Ru for a meal multiple times, but she never agreed. Initially, he thought that she would never eat together with anyone. Never would he imagine that she would be sitting together with the renowned trash of the academy!He almost faints from anger on the spot.Slamming his table, he stands up, prepared to rush over to question her. However, he suddenly recalls Shen Bi Ru's temperament and immediately shrivels back to his seat.She holds intense loathe to those who disturb her. If he were to rush over to interrogate her like this, if she ends up getting provoked by his attitude and rages out at him, there would be no hope for his courtship.\"Shang shaoye, don't be angry. I have an idea that would reveal the true colors of Zhang Xuan before Shen laoshi! Furthermore, it can accentuate the majestic aura of Shang shaoye!\" Cao Xiong is a social expert, allowing him to see through the current situation in an instant. An idea flashed through his mind and he smiles as he tries to coax Shang Bin into action.\"What idea?\"\"This Zhang Xuan is definitely here to fawn on Shen laoshi by treating her to a meal! However, as a low-level teacher, how much money could he possibly earn? We only have to interfere slightly to make the final bill out of his reach to shame him before her! Afterward, Shang shaoye would appear and rescue her from the awkward situation... Shen laoshi's impression of Shang shaoye would definitely improve. Perhaps, the flower of love might even bloom as she runs into your embrace...\" Cao Xiong reveals his plan.\"Good, let's do it your way then!\" Shang Bin's eyes light up as he nods his head in satisfaction.Not only is he able to cripple his opponent, he is also able to elevate his position in Shen Bi Ru's heart at the same time. This is truly a brilliant idea!Looks like this Cao Xiong isn't simply capable at teaching, he also has a way with dealing with humans. Looks like he should be properly groomed in the future.......................................Zhang Xuan doesn't know of the scheme that is being plotted against him. Eating the delicacies on the table, he nods his head in commendation.The cooking techniques here may not be as refined as the ones on Earth, but this world is rich in spirit energy, not to mention that the ingredients used in the dishes are fresh and delicious, thus providing a wholly different enjoyable eating experience.Soon, most of the dishes on the table has been cleaned up and a large portion of them was wiped clean by Zhang Xuan. Shen Bi Ru only nibbled on a small bit of them symbolically.Seeing how this fellow is only obsessed with eating, disregarding even her presence, Shen Bi Ru curls her lips in anger.Initially, she thought that he was feigning it to attract her attention. Only now does she realize that he had never thought of her as an important matter...Regardless of whether it is the genius teachers or star teachers of the academy, they would intentionally fawn on her and offer her favors. Yet, this fellow, the worst ranking teacher of the entire academy, treats her as though she is nothing, making her grind her silver teeth in anger. If it wasn't for her etiquette, she would have already sent both of her legs flying towards his body.The more she thinks about it, the more furious she gets. She knows that if she were to see him continue eating, she would die of anger. She turns around and calls out to the waiter, \"Bill!\"\"A total of 1280 gold coins!\"A waiter walks over.\"1280?\" Shen Bi Ru freezes in shock. \"Why is it so expensive?\"Even for a high-level teacher like her, she only earns 1000 gold coin every month. Yet, to eat away a month of salary in a single meal?How could it be so expensive?She had calculated it properly while she was ordering the dishes, and the bill isn't supposed to even reach 100. How could it jump up to more than 1000 in an instant?\"I'm sorry, but this bottle of wine here costs 1200 gold coins by itself!\" The waiter explains.Previously, when the both of them were eating, a waiter came forth to ask if they wanted some wine. Shen Bi Ru thought that it would be fine to have some alcohol, so she nodded her head in agreement. How could she have possibly imagined that the wine would be that expensive!\"We were uninformed of the price of the wine you sent over...\"Shen Bi Ru's face looks extremely pale at this instant.No matter how foolish she could be, it is obvious that she had been had.\"If you are truly uninterested in it, you should have asked further about it beforehand. Since you didn't ask, we thought that you would be aware of its price, so we didn't say anything excessive!\" The waiter looks at her coldly.\"Hmph!\" Seeing the attitude of the waiter, Shen Bi Ru knows that there's no point in kicking up a fuss. Instead, it might be bad for her reputation if she were to kick up a fuss on this matter. Thus, she whips out her wallet and prepares to pay. Then, her face suddenly turns white and awkwardness exudes from her, \"I don't have sufficient money on me now. Why don't you keep it on my tab first, I will repay you after retrieving sufficient money...\"Today, she only intended to accomplish some reading at the Compendium Pavilion, so she didn't bring much money. After which, she met Zhang Xuan and consulted him on some matters. Due to the excessive shock then, she totally forgot about the matter, recalling it only at this moment. She only has around a hundred gold coins on her, far from the required thousand plus.Treating someone to a meal yet not having sufficient money to foot the tab...She feels a fiery sting on her face as she fervently wishes for a burrow to appear so that she could hide inside it.\"Don't order food that you can't afford! Since you've ordered it, pay up. Don't even dream about eating for free here!\" The waiter harrumphs.\"You...\"Shen Bi Ru's small face flushes in anger.\"What happened?\"At this moment, a stern voice sounds out. Shang Bin, accompanied by Cao Xiong and the Sky Shattering Lion, walks over proudly with widened strides.Dressed in white, his hands are behind him and his head is tilted high, his posture exuding an aura of superiority. In normal times, with his disposition and outer appearance, accompanied with the ferocious Sky Shattering Lion following behind him, he would have looked like an elegant and dashing gentleman. However, at this very moment, his face is swollen red and his eyes are bruised black. Looking from afar, he looks indescribably ridiculous.However, he seems oblivious to it and instead, struts about proudly. With a deep look in his eyes and a distanced aura, he walks forward and his eyes happen to chance upon Shen Bi Ru's body. Feigning shock, he says, \"Shen laoshi, what a coincidence! You're here as well?\"He turns around to look at the waiter and asks, \"What happened here? It is unbecoming to be making a ruckus here!\"\"Ah, so it is Shang shaoye!\" The waiter leaps in fear. He no longer puts on the pushy attitude from before and instead, reveals a careful demeanor as he explains, \"It's like this, they had eaten but they do not have the money to foot the bill...\"\"No money to foot the bill?\"Shang Bin shakes his head as a disappointed expression appears on his face. He gazes at Zhang Xuan and says, \"Zhang laoshi, it is not that I want to lecture you, but if you do not have the money, don't try to feign generosity and treat someone to a meal here. Look, you simply ended up embarrassing yourself! As the worst teacher in the academy, you might be used to it, but to bring shame to Shen laoshi as well, don't you think you have gone a bit too far!\"\"...\"Seeing the arrogant look on the face of the fellow before him, Zhang Xuan pauses for a moment before turning around to look at Shen Bi Ru, \"Sigh, he seems to be talking about you. If you don't have sufficient money, don't feign generosity. Look, you simply ended up embarrassing yourself...\"\"You...\"Upon hearing Shang Bin's words, Shen Bi Ru was already infuriated. Yet, to hear Zhang Xuan repeating the same words again, she almost exploded from all of the accumulated fury. She lifts her head and glares at the gleeful Shang Bin, who is trying to put on an impressive image to win her favor. Luoluo, she grinds her jade teeth together and roars, \"Shang Bin, I dare you to say once more who the one feigning generosity is?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: ScamTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\u201cAh?\u201d Not expecting that the lady would be angered, Shang Bin is astonished. He immediately explains, \u201cShen laoshi, I'm not talking about you, I'm talking about Zhang Xuan. If he doesn't have the money, he shouldn't be going around treating others. Look, he ended up getting stopped by the waiter, how embarrassing is that. He is sullying the prestige of our academy\u2026\u201dThe more he spoke, the darker his goddess's face turns, to the point that it seems as though she will erupt at any moment now. Shang Bin is bewildered by the twist in the situation. At this moment, the waiter interrupts awkwardly, \u201cShang shaoye\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Shang Bin glances at him with a frown.\u201cCough cough, the one that is treating is\u2026 Shen laoshi!\u201d The waiter says.He received the order to cooperate with Shang Bin's show. Yet, he would have never expected that it would be the lady that foots the tab. Before he could report it to him, Shang Bin had already rushed over, making it even more difficult to explain the situation to him.\u201cShen laoshi is the one treating?\u201dShang Bin is horrified. His eyes widens in disbelief.Are you for real?He had been asking the goddess out to eat everyday and yet she simply dismisses his invitations. What rights does the worst teacher of the academy have to be sharing a meal with her, not to mention\u2026 having her to treat him?\u201cWhy? Just because I have no money to foot the tab means I'm feigning generosity and embarrassing myself, is it!\u201d Shen Bi Ru glares at him coldly. She had been embarrassed in front of Zhang Xuan multiple times today and she had been dispirited over it all this while. Yet, this fellow just had to mock her at such a moment. She feels her rage on the verge of flying out of control.\u201cNo, that's not it\u2026\u201d Shang Bin's face pales and he looks as though he is about to cry.Only now does he understands that he had accidentally insulted his goddess in the midst of trying to fawn on her. He immediately waves his hands as though to dispel the misunderstanding, \u201cI didn't mean that, I mean to\u2026 to\u2026\u201dStuttering, he is unsure of how he should explain it.However, as expected of a teacher of the academy and the grandson of an elder. Having experienced and seen many things, he quickly recovers and turns to look at the waiter. Gesturing majestically, he declares, \u201cAlright, Shen laoshi's debt is my debt. How much does it cost? I will pay for her!\u201d\u201cShang shaoye, you are an esteemed guest of our Hongtian Pavilion, how can we accept your money!\u201d The waiter nods his head in a panic.These are the lines they had prepared beforehand so as to flaunt his background and ability before his goddess.\u201cThat is great\u2026\u201d Shang Bin wanted to tug on the subject awhile longer to showcase his superiority when Shen Bi Ru's cold voice sounds out once more, \u201cIt's okay, I will pay for my expenses so that others won't claim that I am feigning generosity!\u201dAt this moment, she retrieves a hairpin from her head and passes it over, \u201cThis jade hairpin is worth at least 5000 gold coins, you can verify it with a specialist. I will be leaving it in your care first. After I retrieve my money, I will be back to redeem it!\u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201dHolding the jade hairpin, the waiter is unsure of what he should do.This isn't part of the script they agreed on\u2026\u201cShen laoshi, you don't have to do this. I am acquainted with manager Wu of Hongtian Pavilion, so as long as I speak up, that debt of yours don't mean anything at all\u2026\u201dShang Bin hurriedly steps forward.\u201cThat's your problem, what does it have to do with me?\u201d Shen Bi Ru interrupts his words. Then, she turns to look at the waiter again and says, \u201cI will be leaving first if you aren't going to be looking for a specialist to verify it!\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d The waiter looks at Shang Bin in a panic and the plea in his gaze is clear to see.\u201cWhat are you looking at me for?\u201d Shang Bin waves his hand quickly. With a furious gaze, he continues, \u201cI don't know you at all!\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dZhang Xuan didn't expect that a single meal would end in such a farce. Shaking his head, he steps forward, retrieves the jade hairpin from the waiter and passes it back to Shen Bi Ru. \u201cWhy are giving this to him? This meal isn't even worth 1280 gold coins. Giving him money like this, are you that anxious to be scammed?\u201d\u201cScammed? Hongtian Pavilion has nearly ten years behind its establishment. Our prices are fair and we do not discriminate between our customers. There has never been a single person who had such an issue with us before, so what do you mean by those words?\u201dThe moment Zhang Xuan words land, a middle-aged man walks over with large strides.It is the manager of Hongtian Pavilion, Wu Chou.He had talked it through with Shang Bin and he wasn't supposed to appear initially. However, upon hearing Zhang Xuan talking about a scam, he couldn't hold it in anymore.The events occurring here has attracted the attention of many customers. If he doesn't show up and allow the other party to speak as his pleases instead, the reputation of the tavern would be sullied. If that happens, his boss, Elder Hong Hao, would kill him when he returns.\u201cWhat do I mean? Do I really have to voice it out?\u201dZhang Xuan's eyelids lift up slightly and a lazy atmosphere emanates from him.\u201cHmph, we use the finest ingredients for every single dish of our Hongtian Pavilion so that they are served fresh and delicious. Our prices have also undergone the stringent checks of the academy. If you aren't able to explain yourself, regardless of the fact of whether you are a teacher of the academy or not, you don't have to dream about leaving here today!\u201dManager Wu's face darkens.To a tavern, scamming one's customers is a very heavy sin to bear. If he doesn't settle it now, Hongtian Pavilion could possibly go out of operation when such a reputation spreads.\u201cHe is truly courting death!\u201dInitially, he thought that Zhang Xuan would get away scot-free once again. However, seeing Zhang Xuan accuse Hongtian Pavilion of scamming its customer and offending manager Wu, a glint flashes across Shang Bin's eyes as he watches the situation gleefully.Manager Wu may seem like an amiable person with a good temper, but when the reputation of Hongtian Pavilion is on the line, he would be like a raging bull who doesn't know the meaning of retreat!Looks like the fellow who is the first from the last in the academy is in for a ride of misfortune!\u201cWhat is this fellow rambling about\u2026\u201dPanic can be seen on Shen Bi Ru's face.For Hongtian Pavilion to be opened in Hongtian Academy at such a tremendous scale, its backing is clear to see at a single glance. Yet, you dare to accuse them of scamming their customers in public, aren't you asking for trouble?A large tavern like this values its reputation a lot.\u201cSince you requested for me to say it, then I will spare with the formalities!\u201dDespite the Wu Chou's threat, Zhang Xuan is unfazed. He walks up to the table and says.\u201cThis \u3010Violet Savage Bear Meat\u3011, going by your claims, is prepared by slaughtering a Savage Bear before soaking it in Violet Flowers for three days. This way, the exterior will be crispy while the interiors will be tender and the meat will be filled with fragrance. However, you all took it out for frying right after soaking it for just a day. Although the texture is still the same, the medical properties of the Violet Flower has yet to soak in, making it would be useless no matter how many of it one eats!\u201d\u201cAs for this \u3010Honghu Mandarin Fish\u3011, you all advertised it as wild mandarin fishes caught in Lake Hong. However, they are actually mandarin fishes that you all have been rearing in Yeluo Bay. It is easy to differentiate between the two. As wild mandarin fishes have to battle against their natural predators, \u3010Qinghe Turtle\u3011, the fin of the tail of Honghu mandarin fishes tend to be tougher than those that are reared, and its tail would be significantly thicker as well. One only has to slightly look into the matter to know whether what I'm saying is true!\u201d\u201cAs for this \u3010Clear Saut\u00e9ed Nestled Heart Herb\u3011, the ingredients used isn't even Nestled Heart Herb but Bitter Heart Herb! These two plants are actually one of a kind, just that they are cultivated under different conditions, thus the difference in their names. Nestled Heart Grass grows beside the nests of savage beasts and is taken care by them. Their stems would tend to be thicker and their nutrition value is significantly higher as well!\u201d\u201cBitter Heart Herb grows in the wilderness and is extremely cheap. Its stem is thin and its nutrition value is lower by a huge chunk! For the same plate of vegetable, the difference in their value is almost tenfold! Completely different in comparison! Listing it as Nestled Heart Herb but cooking the dish using Bitter Heart Herb, if this isn't a scam, what else could it be?\u201d\u2026Casually pointing to any dish, he is able to clearly point out the origin and flaws in it. Upon hearing those words, manager Wu's earlier aggression fades as his face pales.As the manager of Hongtian Pavilion, he isn't just involved in attending to the customers, he is also in charge of the affairs in the kitchen. Naturally, he is aware of the authenticity of the Zhang Xuan's words.Not only is he not speaking nonsense, his words are\u2026 completely true!The boss isn't aware of these things. For his own profit, Wu Chou discreetly got someone to switch them. Not even professional gourmets could tell the differences between Honghu Mandarin Fish, Nestled Heart Herb and their imitation, thus proving that the substitutes for these two are identical.How could this young man tell? Furthermore, for him to be completely spot-on.\u201cDamn it!\u201d\u201cWe specially came here from afar to try the authentic Nestled Heart Herb, to think that it would be an imitation!\u201d\u201cMe too. I've heard that the Honghu Mandarin Fish is delicious, authentic and fragrant, thus I specially made the journey here. How dare you all try to fool us!\u201d\u201cRefund, refund! To think that the number one tavern of Hongtian Academy would resort to using imitations, not to mention that I am a regular customer! I would have never imagined that it was all a scam!\u201d\u2026Zhang Xuan's words are unhurried and rational with sufficient evidence to back up his claims. The crowd who was watching the show immediately bursts into an uproar.Hongtian Pavilion could be considered a reputable tavern, even in the entire Tianxuan Kingdom. Many of its specialties has attracted innumerable experts to make the journey. They would have never imagined that these were all fake.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: What is HappeningTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"You... Nonsense!\"Seeing the crowd breaking out into a commotion, cold sweat drips down from manager Wu's forehead. He grits his teeth and bellows.He must not admit to it now. The moment he does, Hongtian Pavilion's reputation will be ruined, and his future will be gone with it as well.If only he knew that this teacher is a gourmet, he would have never agreed to Shang Bin's request even if he was beaten to death!\"You are claiming that what I said was nonsense?\" Zhang Xuan glances at him.\"Indeed. You said that these dishes are imitations, but you don't have evidence to back up your claim. Without evidence, your words are nonsense. Do you think that I wouldn't dare to have you arrested for the crime of slander?\" Manager Wu says ferociously.\"Evidence? You want evidence? Fine!\"Seeing how this fellow is adamant to push on, Zhang Xuan shakes his head.Initially, he didn't want to pursue the matter any further. After all, Shen Bi Ru is the one treating, so it doesn't matter to him how much the dishes cost. However, who knew that this fellow would stubbornly claim that he was slandering them. Since that is the case, Zhang Xuan is resolute to prevent him from getting away scot-free.\"I have already provided the evidence of the few dishes before. Everyone can inspect their food carefully based on the unique traits that I have just brought up! Of course, it's okay if he is reluctant to acknowledge it. After all, even if you all know all these, some gourmets will still find it difficult to distinguish between them, needless to say, the rest of you! However...\"Zhang Xuan surveys the surroundings before casually lifting up the most expensive bottle of wine on the table up and declares, \"Everyone would be able to easily discern the authenticity of this bottle of wine!\"\"Discern its authenticity? \"Drunk Immortal\" is the specialty of Hongtian Pavilion! This is a fact known by everyone. Many people specially made the trip here just for the wine. Are you trying to say that the wine is fake as well?\"A customer can't resist asking.\"Indeed, Drunk Immortal is the trademark of Hongtian Pavilion, so surely it can't be faked? If this turns out to be an imitation as well, I doubt that there can be anything real in here!\"Another customer speaks up.The wine that was offered to Zhang Xuan's table previously is called Drunk Immortal and its sale is exclusive to Hongtian Pavilion. The wine is rich, delicious and has an exquisite fragrance! This wine played a crucial role to the current reputation and scale of Hongtian Pavilion!If even this wine turns out to be an imitation... That would be going way overboard!\"I've already said that it would be easy to discern it!\"As though he had expected the crowd to doubt his words, Zhang Xuan simply responds with a faint smile and raises the bottle. \"The words [Drunk Immortal] are written on the cover of the bottle. If this is truly the Drunk Immortal from [Hundred Well Brewery], it would indeed be worth 1200 gold coins!\"\"But it is a pity that the bottle is filled with [Green Crag Brew] from [Purple Bamboo Gazebo]. These two wines are similar in terms of their scent and their texture. However, the former is brewed using the valuable and rare Rooted Earth Grass and Green Cicada Heart Leaf and it nourishes the body when drunk. On the other hand, if one drinks too much of the Green Crag Brew, the venom from the Fallen Floral Grass would attack one's heart and lungs. Over time, the function of one's organs will deteriorate, causing one's cultivation to fall rapidly, thus ending their lives tragically!\"\"Using Green Crag Brew to imitate Fallen Immortal?\"\"I've heard of Green Crag Brew! If I remember correctly, its taste is similar with Fallen Immortal!\"\"I've always trusted in the quality of the goods of Hongtian Pavilion. I would have never imagined that they would fool their customers like that!\"\"This is a fraud! I will be reporting this to the academy so that an investigation will be conducted!\"...The customers who were watching the commotion, upon hearing that they have been scammed, cry out indignantly.\"Just because you said that it is Green Crag Brew, doesn't mean that it would necessarily be it. Where's your evidence?\" Manager Wu squeezes out these words between his gritted teeth.Glancing at him, Zhang Xuan replies calmly, \"Wine can be ignited with fire. I haven't touched much of the alcohol in it so you can ignite this one. The true Fallen Immortal should exude an alluring fragrance, similar to lilies and musk! On the other hand, for Green Crag Brew, a charred odor would be released. All those who have noses should be able to discern between the two easily!\"\"You...\"Manager Wu's body goes stiff.The other party's words are completely accurate. However, this method of distinguishing between the two isn't very well-known. Only the makers of Green Crag Brew and their vendors are aware of it. Even Wu Chou himself only heard of it coincidentally. How could this fellow know of this method as well?Actually, the wine given to other customers are all true Fallen Immortal. After all, this is the trademark specialty of the tavern. After hearing Shang Bin's plan, he intentionally passed this fake wine over to the young man, thinking that he would be unable to discern between the two so that he would be able to make an earning out of this. In the end, not only is the other party aware of it, he is even able to state the method to distinguish between the two clearly!If Zhang Xuan were to prove himself right, it would be difficult to explain to everyone that what they're drinking is the authentic Fallen Immortal!\"Why? You don't dare to give it a try?\"Seeing the look of panic on the other person's face, Zhang Xuan smiles faintly. He casually turns the wine bottle over, allowing the wine to spill onto the floor. Then, he takes out an ignitable paper roll and snaps his fingers.Xiong xiong!When the wine on the floor comes into contact with the flames, it lights up and instantaneously, a stinging odor assaults the noses of the crowd, leaving them faint-headed.\"How pungent! This was what we were drinking?\"\"Hongtian Pavilion really doesn't respect their customers!\"\"For it to be so pungent, it must be poisonous...\"\"Refund, refund! I've been drinking your wine here for three years. Not only do I want you to return it all back to me, I want additional compensation as well!\"...The entire tavern explodes into an uproar.Everyone rushes forward.\"What... What is happening?\"Cao Xiong and Shang Bin feels like they are going mad by the sudden turn of events.They had specially set up this ploy to humiliate Zhang Xuan. In the end, not only was he not humiliated, he even managed to stand out instead!Instead, they were shamed like clowns!\"What is happening... What is happening your head!\"By the side, manager Wu had just barely kept his emotions in check, but upon hearing those words, he loses control and kicks them both.Peng! Peng!He is a Fighter 6-dan Pixue realm expert. Before the two of them could even react, the sight before them goes dark and they crash onto the ground. A giant footprint is left on each of their faces.It is no wonder that manager Wu would go berserk. If it weren't for these two fellows, such an incident would not have occurred!He can already foresee that not only will his career come to an end, he would also have to face the rage of Elder Hong Hao!After this incident, Hongtian Pavilion's reputation would definitely go into the gutters and their business would no longer be as prosperous as before.The cause of this entire incident is him accepting the request of these two fellows to teach the lad, who is last in the Teacher Qualification Examination, a lesson!How can it be possible for this lad to be the last? Even the first in the examinations can't possibly be so incredible!If only he knew in advance that this master had such powerful eyes of discernment... Not only would he have not caused Zhang Xuan any trouble, he would have been praying for him to not cause him any!Damn it!\"Looks like there isn't anyone free to collect money from us right now, let's go!\"Seeing how the situation has descended into chaos, Zhang Xuan signals to Shen Bi Ru, who is still in a state of daze, and walks out of the tavern.Now that the problem has been settled, staying here would just result in more troubles. Thus, it would wiser for them to simply leave.\"Un!\"Shen Bi Ru hurriedly catches up to him. Seeing the young man in front her, her eyes are filled with complex emotions.All along, she thought that he is a trash, an ignorant fellow who is the shame of the teaching community!After half a day of interaction, she realized that... if he is a trash, then what is she?Doesn't it mean that she is nothing at all?Gritting her teeth, she walks up. With disbelief still reflecting within her beautiful pitch black eyes, she asks, \"You seem to be quite knowledgeable about food. Could it be that... you're a gourmet?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: GourmetTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexThere are many occupations in this world and gourmet is one of them. Gourmets are often born sensitive to taste, and their ability to discern flavors far exceeds ordinary humans.Their cultivation may not necessarily be high, but there are some hotels or taverns that would hire them at high salaries so as to ascertain the taste and effects of their ingredients.However, this occupation is one of the least esteemed ones and can only be considered one of the Lower Nine Paths.There are more than several thousands of occupations in the world. To better classify them, they are split into the Upper Nine Paths, Middle Nine Paths and Lower Nine Paths.Apothecary, blacksmith, formation master and similar jobs which brings about benefits to battle techniques and one's cultivation are considered as the conventional Upper Nine Paths. On the other hand, gourmet could only be considered as an unorthodox occupation, thus being classified under the Lower Nine Paths.Going by Shen Bi Ru's opinion, given how the young man is capable of pointing out the flaws in those dishes and wine, he had to be a gourmet.\u201cYou can take it so!\u201d Zhang Xuan doesn't explain.The Library of Heaven's Path does more than reflecting one's cultivation. As long as he has tried a dish, its flaws would be reflected in the library. With this, it is a simple task for him to take care of a small manager Wu.\u201cThank you for your help today\u2026\u201dSeeing the other party admit to it, Shen Bi Ru thanks him.If it wasn't for this young man's ability to discern delicacies, it would be truly embarrassing for her today.\u201cIt's nothing!\u201d Zhang Xuan waves his hand.\u201cYou resolved the problem just a moment ago, so it can't be considered as my treat. I'll treat you again next time!\u201d Shen Bi Ru says.\u201cTreat me again?\u201d Zhang Xuan ponders over it and shakes his head. \u201cBetter not, I still treasure my life!\u201dEating with a beauty may be an enjoyable event, but he knows himself the best. Given his reputation, the other party might simply be speaking out of politeness despite being repulsed by the idea!Not only so, he would have to suffer from the envy of others. If so, he would have to come up with ideas to deal with her pursuers. However, there are still many things that he needs to do at the moment and he doesn't have the leisure for such matters.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dJust when she thought that Zhang Xuan could speak normally, she hears those words and feels a blockade in her chest again as the urge to go berserk surges through her.Many people had asked her out to eat, but she rejected them all. Yet, when she takes the initiative to invite him, she feels as though she is begging a stubborn elderly.Detestable!\u201cAlright, since we have already eaten, if there's nothing else, I'll be making a move first. I still have many things to attend to!\u201d Oblivious to her rage, he waves and prepares to take his leave.\u201cWait, I'm not done yet!\u201d Suppressing her anger, Shen Bi Ru calms down her breathing and looks at him with her beautiful eyes. \u201cYou might have resolved that difficulty in my stead today and your occupation as a gourmet played a huge role in it, but\u2026 In the end, it is still an unorthodox occupation. After all, a fighter should focus on his training\u2026\u201dFighters, upon cultivating to a certain realm, are able to survive without ingesting food, so delicacies do not have much use. Even if he is able to profit out of the occupation for now, it still isn't a proper path a fighter should be treading on.After interacting with him, she could tell that Zhang Xuan isn't as useless as the rumors make him out to be. It could be possible that he had devoted his efforts to studying food, that's why his Teacher Qualification Examination results ended up horrendous.Upon such thoughts, despite her overwhelming anger, she couldn't resist advising him.\u201cAlright!\u201d Knowing that she said those words out of goodwill, Zhang Xuan nods his head. Just as he is about to leave, rapid footsteps sound out from his back.\u201cZhang Xuan, let's see where you can escape to today! Today, don't even dream about getting away!\u201dFollowing which, a resentful voice echoes in the surroundings. Two men and one beast block his path.They are Shang Bin and Cao Xiong.At this moment, the two of them have a giant footprint imprinted on their face, the outlines of it clear to see. Half of their face are swollen red and blood trickles down by edges of their mouth. Not a single hint of their previous dashing and carefree look remain.This is especially so for Shang Bin. His injuries from the morning have yet to recover and yet, he suffered another violent kick. At this instant, his mouth is crooked to the side and his lips look like two giant sausages, thus pulling him further away from the concept of handsomeness.He had planned everything out perfectly so as to look cool in front of his goddess. Who knew that not only would he fail, he even got beaten up to such a state and his connection with Hongtian Pavilion was severed as a result. If things go wrong, he might even be chastised by his grandfather. How could he take this humiliation lying?The more he thinks about it, the angrier he gets. Thus, he charges up directly towards Zhang Xuan!\u201cShang Bin, what do you intend to do?\u201d Shen Bi Ru didn't expect him to come in pursuit to cause trouble. She steps in front of Zhang Xuan to shield him from Shang Bin.\u201cShen laoshi, don't block my way! This is a personal grudge between Zhang Xuan and me!\u201dIt is one thing if he doesn't see her, but when he sees her shielding the infamous trash of the academy, Shang Bin is further provoked as his eyes slant to the sides and his mouth crooks further from the overwhelming rage.The intense envy clouding his mind makes him frenzied. He stares coldly at that young man and shouts, \u201cZhang Xuan, are you a man? If you're one, stop hiding behind a woman and have a fair duel to the death with me!\u201dSeeing how the fellow before him has lost his rationality, Zhang Xuan widens his eyes and says, \u201cSo what if I'm hiding behind a woman? This is a part of my capabilities. If you're capable, find one to hide behind as well!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dShang Bin almost vomits blood.As long as it is a man, if someone insults him by saying that he is gutless and hides behind the protection of a woman, won't they feel embarrassed and humiliated such that they would rush forward to retaliate out of indignation?Why does common sense not apply to this fellow?How can he speak of something that should have been incomparably shameful so naturally and righteously?****, how can one be so thick-skinned?\u201cShen laoshi, I'll be leaving these two for you to deal with. I still have something on, so I'll be taking my leave first!\u201dAs a transcender, what has he never seen before? Thick-skinned?What a joke. In his previous life, in the information era\u2026 Have you seen anyone who isn't shameless?He can't be bothered to deal with a problem which someone had taken the initiative to resolve for him.This isn't fear. Rather, it isn't a good time for him to be revealing his level of cultivation. On top of that, the Shang Bin's grandfather is an elder. If he were to be forced to a corner, Zhang Xuan would have to waste precious time dealing with the problems that will ensue. Since someone is shielding him, he is also happy to be spared the effort.\u201c\u2026\u201dSeeing how shameless the young man is, Shen Bi Ru is also at a loss for words.Just a moment ago, she was still fearful that he would be provoked by Shang Bin's taunt and duel with him. Now, it does seem that she was over thinking it\u2026If this fellow could be provoked, even sows would be able to climb trees!\u201cZhang Xuan, hold it there! If I can't kill you today, I won't be called Shang Bin!\u201dSeeing the attitude of the young man, Shang Bin becomes even more enraged. Veins pop out from his temples and his face turns a shade of green. Seeing that Shen Bi Ru has no intention of letting him through, he roars, \u201cSky Shattering Lion, kill him! As long as you do it, I will bring you delicacies every day! Furthermore, I will give you the \u3010Acupoint Soothing Pill\u3011 that my grandfather promised me!\u201dAs a tier 6 savage beast that has been tamed by a human, the Sky Shattering Lion is capable of comprehending human words.As his grandfather's pet, as long as Shang Bin is kept out of harm's way, it couldn't be bothered with his orders. In order to get it to make a move, he promised all kinds of benefits to him in an instant.\u201cRoar!\u201dIndeed, hearing his promises, the eyes of the Sky Shattering Lion light up.Savage beasts who have reached Pixue realm, unlike humans, are unable use the flow of zhenqi to break open their acupoints. They can only rely on the growth of their body to gradually pull up their strength. If it were to consume the Acupoint Soothing Pill at this moment, with its effects, its strength would surely soar significantly!Acupoint Soothing Pill is a pill made specially for Fighter 6-dan experts. It possesses the effect of soothing one's acupoints, thus allowing one to progress further in Pixue realm.At this moment, Shang Bin's strength has already reached Fighter 5-dan Dingli pinnacle, just a step off from Pixue. Thus, Elder Shang Chen spent a huge sum to obtain this medicine so as to give him a boost.Initially, Shang Bin was reluctant to take it out. However, upon recalling how he was humiliated by a trash, he finds himself unable to suppress his emotions!If he doesn't get rid of Zhang Xuan today, he fears that he would be unable to uphold his dignity in the academy anymore.This is especially so for the goddess before him, she probably wouldn't even spare him a gaze!How can he tolerate such a situation!\u201cShang Bin, what do you intend to do? Killing a colleague in academy compounds is a huge crime\u2026\u201dShe didn't expect Shang Bin to be so insane to order the Sky Shattering Lion to make a move. Shen Bi Ru's eyes narrow. She wants to rush forward to protect Zhang Xuan, but is blocked by Shang Bin instead. Panicking, she bellows at him.In the compounds, teachers are forbidden from killing one another. To do so is an infringement of the school rules, as well as a severe crime.\u201cZhang Xuan was the one who wanted to kill me. To protect me, the Sky Shattering Lion retaliated. What I did was legitimate self-defense, what can the others say about it?\u201d Shang Bin's eyes turn red from insanity. He roars, \u201cSky Shattering Lion, what are you hesitating for? Do it!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dShen Bi Ru feels her heart turning cold.Too shameless!If he were to really use that as a front, with Elder Shang Chen's interference within the matter, he might really get away with it! In fact, it is possible for him to escape punishment completely!Zhang Xuan could very well die here!After all, it is a tier 6 savage beast. Ordinary Pixue realm experts aren't even its match. How can one who is the last in the Teacher Qualification Examination withstand it?\u201cRoar!\u201dJust when she is still in a fluster, the Sky Shattering Lion roars and dashes over. Before coming into contact with it, its powerful aura creates a powerful gale that forces the surrounding grass and tree leaves to bow down to it.Nine Paths, also known as Three Teachings and Nine PathsThis is a real terminology used to classify jobs in ancient China.To put it simply, there are Upper Nine Paths, Middle Nine Paths and Lower Nine Paths in ancient China and each of these paths refer to an occupation.For example, the top occupations in ancient China (the nine occupations listed in the Upper Nine Paths) are:Emperor, Saints, Secluded Masters, Oracle, Scholar, Warrior, Farmer, Worker, Merchant (And they are classified fromMost esteemed <\u2013> Least esteemed)Similarly, the Middle Nine Paths and Lower Nine Paths have their own set of occupations as well.The Three Teachings refer to Confucianism, Daoism (or Taoism) and Buddhism.Do note that there are different interpretations/versions to the Nine Paths and most of them list Buddha as the first one.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: Big Sister Spare Me!Translator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Zhang Xuan...\"Shen Bi Ru tried to break through Shang Bin's blockade to save him, but she was knocked back consecutive times.Shang Bin's cultivation is on the same level as her. He might be spoiled due to his powerful backing, but his strength isn't false. Even if she possesses the strength to defeat him, she is still unable to break through his blockade within a short period of time, especially if he chooses to execute only defensive maneuvers!\"I am the one who brought harm to you...\"Seeing how she is unable to save him, Shen Bi Ru is filled with guilt.She thinks that the reason why Shang Bin is dealing with this fellow, who was the last for the Teacher Qualification Examination, is because of her!Otherwise, as someone of such high standing and the grandson of an elder, towards an infamous trash who has no background whatsoever, when there's no connection between the two, why would there be a grudge between them?Yet, after pulling him down into the mud, she is unable to save him. The guilt she is experiencing at the moment torments her painfully!\"Why is there no movements? Could it be that Zhang Xuan has already died?\"The more panicked she gets, the more incapable she is of breaking through Shang Bin's blockade. With Shang Bin blocking her sight, she is unable to view the situation over at Zhang Xuan's side. She can only hear complete silence in the surroundings, as though he didn't even struggle against the assault of the Sky Shattering Lion.There can only be one possibility... Before Zhang Xuan could retaliate, he was already smacked to death by the Sky Shattering Lion!After all, even she is unable to withstand a single blow from the tier 6 savage beast, who is equivalent to a Pixue realm expert.\"Haha, he is already dead. It is too late for you to make a move now...\"Hearing that there is no movements behind him, Shang Bin's eyes light up. He knows that the trash would definitely be unable to withstand a single blow from the Sky Shattering Lion. He laughs heartily out of excitement. Judging that there is no need to block Shen Bi Ru any longer, he leaps aside.\"Zhang Xuan...\"The moment Shang Bin leaps away, Shen Bi Ru doesn't waste time on him and hurriedly rushes forward. Just when she thought she would see a pool of fresh blood with a miserable corpse lying in the center of it, her slim figure suddenly freezes and she stares in a daze.\"This... This... What happened?\"Initially, Shang Bin thought that his goddess would burst into years from the shock of the sight. However, upon seeing such an expression hang on her face, Shang Bin quickly turns around to take a look. With a single glimpse, his eyeballs widen into huge circles and he almost faints from overwhelming astonishment.He sees the incomparably ferocious Sky Shattering Lion, which had rushed towards Zhang Xuan earlier to rip him into numerous shreds before, lying in front of Zhang Xuan like a pug, licking his hands.Zhang Xuan's other hand is stroking the head and ears of the Sky Shattering Lion and unspeakable pleasure appears on its face.\"The heck? What happened?\"Shang Bin is on the verge of tears.This Sky Shattering Lion is his grandfather's beast pet and it is extremely proud. Even for Shang Bin himself, just a simple touch would incur its fury, not to mention stroking its head!After taking possession of it from his grandfather, he had spent half a day of effort on it, feeding it numerous delicacies. Yet, this fellow doesn't even show the slightest bit of gratitude, disregarding his presence as he pleases... Such a proud fellow became a pug before Zhang Xuan?You are here to kill him! To be lying before him and licking his palm, is this really alright?Shang Bin feels a dizziness spell working up, and he is on the verge of going crazy.\"Sky Shattering Lion, what are you doing? Quickly kill him!\"He bellows.The Sky Shattering Lion doesn't move. It continues to lazy around, allowing Zhang Xuan stroke his head freely.\"You... Quickly kill him! If you do it, I will buy you anything you want to eat from now on...\" Shang Bin roars anxiously.\"So noisy, make him shut up!\"Zhang Xuan, who was stroking the Sky Shattering Lion, stands up and waves his hand.Roar!The Sky Shattering Lion stands up as well and glares at Shang Bin savagely.\"What are you planning to do?\"Frightened, Shang Bin immediately retreats several steps.However, before he could get far, the Sky Shattering Lion dashes forward and takes a sweep at him lightly with its paws.Peng!Before Shang Bin could react, he is sent flying backward like a kite that had its string snapped. His head knocks onto a giant tree and crimson blood fills his entire face.\"What exactly happened... You are my grandfather's beast pet...\"Shang Bin cries.This Sky Shattering Lion is the beast pet that his grandfather passed on to him to protect him. Logically, it should have listened to his words to deal with the outsider. Why did it listen to the words of an outsider to attack him?Peng!Before he could finish crying, another figure crashes onto the ground in front of him. He is Cao Xiong.When that fellow noticed the situation turning awry, he immediately turned around to flee. However, how could he possibly escape from the Sky Shattering Lion, a tier 6 savage beast? He is sent flying back with a slap.Roar!After sending these two flying, the Sky Shattering Lion looks as though it has done something glorious. It walks over to Zhang Xuan with a flattering look, as though wanting to be acknowledged for its accomplishment.\"Un, not bad. You did well!\"Zhang Xuan pats its head!Roar!The Sky Shattering Lion nods its head quickly. It walks gallantly to the two lying on the floor, keeping a watch on them with a proud look, reminiscent of a responsible watchdog.\"...\"Shang Bin and Cao Xiong who were planning to escape are on a verge of tears.\"Zhang Xuan... You... How did you do that?\"Spectating the entire flow of events by the side, the dumbstruck Shen Bi Ru finally recovers and gazes at him curiously.\"How did I do it?\" Zhang Xuan scratches his head. \"This Sky Shattering Lion is very easy to communicate with. Perhaps, it might be because I am more handsome!\"\"Handsome?\"Shen Bi Ru blinks and her slim figure staggers.The Sky Shattering Lion is a savage beast. To it, the term handsome should only be applicable to male Sky Shattering Lions, so what do you being handsome or not have to do with it?Besides, if one must talk about handsomeness, Shang Bin is much more dashing than you...\"Alright! Farewell!\" Zhang Xuan doesn't continue explaining and turns around to leave.Since the Library of Heaven's Path can peer into the weaknesses of a human, naturally, it would be able to peer into those of the Sky Shattering Lion as well.This fellow may seem extremely powerful, but in actuality, it has sustained quite a few hidden traumas. Otherwise, it couldn't have possibly willingly served as Elder Shang Chen's beast pet.The library has detected this flaw of it. Making use of it, Zhang Xuan casually solved some of the easier ones for it. As a result, the Sky Shattering Lion chooses to obey his commands obediently without the slightest hesitation.In comparison to Shang Bin's promise, no amount of delicious food and pills can compare with a resolved hidden trauma.Of course, this involves his secret as well, so he can't possibly reveal the truth to Shen Bi Ru.\"You... Don't go, you haven't explained the reason why the Sky Shattering Lion obeyed to your commands...\"Seeing him leave, Shen Bi Ru quickly catches up.The more she comes into contact with this young man, the more formidable she finds him to be. He is a mystery that is becoming more and more difficult to comprehend.Being able to read so many books just by flipping through them, intentionally scoring a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examinations despite knowing the answers, realizing his identity as a gourmet through a meal and convincing a tier 6 savage beast to follow his commands easily...What that seems impossible in the eyes of others is accomplished so simply by this young man, leaving others staring in disbelief!How does he accomplish all these?Shen Bi Ru is becoming more and more curious about this young man before her.\"Big sister!\"Oblivious to what she is thinking of, upon seeing her chasing him, Zhang Xuan halts his footsteps and says helplessly, \"I want to live a long life. I'm afraid that I might not live to the next day being beside you! Just spare me...\"\"Big sister? You are the big sister. Your entire family is big sisters!\"Shen Bi Ru's face turns bright red.She is a beauty. She might be slightly older than Zhang Xuan, but she looks no different from a seventeen or eighteen year old. Yet, this fellow addressed her as a big sister, thus causing her to go into a frenzy.\"Fine, I am the big sister. So, just let me leave!\"Zhang Xuan shakes his head in frustration.\"Pft!\"Upon hearing Zhang Xuan claim that he is the big sister, Shen Bi Ru chuckles and says, \"Fine, you can leave. I will look for you tomorrow!\"\"...\"Zhang Xuan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: Reprise BellTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexIt is a scene of chaos in Hongtian Pavilion.\"What happened? I have barely been away for a while and such a sight awaits my return?\"In a room, an elderly stares coldly at the kneeling manager Wu.He is the mastermind behind Hongtian Pavilion, Elder Hong Hao.\"Elder, it is like that. The grandson of Elder Shang Chen, Shang Bin, has been here...\" Manager Wu doesn't dare to conceal anything and discloses everything that had happened.This includes the affair which he swapped the Drunk Immortal with Green Crag Brew.\"Wu Chou, how dare you!\"After hearing Wu Chou's words, Elder Hong Hao's face darkens and he angrily sends a kick towards him.Peng!Manager Wu is immediately sent flying backward. His face pales as he vomits mouthful after mouthful of blood. \"Elder, spare me! I do not dare hope to be forgiven for my crimes, but that fellow is even viler. To expose all of these in public and causing the reputation of our Hongtian Pavilion to be ruined, he obviously disregards elder you completely...\"\"Hmph! After doing such shameful things, you still expect others not to talk about them?\" Elder Hong Hao's face looks hostile, as though a violent storm is gathering on it\"I...\"Manager Wu trembles uncontrollably.Changing the contents of the dishes to earn more profits is a decision he made at his own discretion. He thought that he had concealed it perfectly. Yet, he was exposed by that young man in public. Naturally, he feels great resentment against him.\"I'll give you five days to settle this problem thoroughly. I want the negative impacts to be reduced to the bare minimum! If so, I can consider not to pursue the matter of your corruption. Otherwise, don't even dream about getting away alive!\" Elder Hong Hao's eyes are cold like a blizzard at night. Standing up, he asks, \"Also, what is the name of that fellow? Is he a teacher of the academy? If he had informed me discreetly, I might have rewarded him with a sum of fortune, but he chose to cause trouble in public instead, soiling the reputation of my Hongtian Pavilion. I will have a good look at him tomorrow to see who is the one who gave him such guts!\"Bellowing furiously, a savage aura fills the surroundings. It feels like a frontal assault by a wave of frost, causing one to shiver uncontrollably despite the warm weather.Fighter 7-dan Tongxuan realm!This Elder Hong Hao is a Tongxuan realm expert! It is no wonder that he was able to vie for the position of the principal. Just his level of cultivation itself is already astonishing!\"It... It is Zhang Xuan laoshi!\"Manager Wu quickly says.\"Zhang Xuan? The one who was the last in the Teacher Qualification Examination?\" Elder Hong Hao is taken aback.Hongtian Academy had never had a single teacher scoring at the very bottom of the Teacher Qualification Examination throughout its centuries of history since its inception. Thus, even a person like Elder Hong Hao had heard of Zhang Xuan's name.\"That's him...\" Manager Wu nods his head.\"A trash would actually dare to trample on the dignity of Hongtian Pavilion? Excellent!\" Clenching his fist, a cold glint flashes across his eyes. A heavy murdering intent emanates from Elder Hong Hao.If the other party is a star teacher or an influential figure in the academy, he might have some hesitation over punishing him. However, since he is a trash... Then, don't blame him for being heartless!....................................\"Sigh, how troublesome!\"Returning back to his dwelling, Zhang Xuan massages the center of his eyebrows.He would have never thought it possible for so much trouble to evolve from just a simple meal.\"Forget it, there's no use pondering over it. I better spend my time thinking about how I can break into Pixue realm!\"Quickly, he dumps all excessive thoughts to the back of his head.Despite being a transcender, he knows that in this world, power reigns might. Only with sufficient power will the problems of one cease to be.He is currently at Dingli realm pinnacle and to break through, he would need the cultivation techniques of Fighter 6-dan.However, an ordinary teacher doesn't have the qualification to browse through the 6-dan cultivation techniques of the academy. They can only jot down a copy of it with the approval of an elder.In the previous examination, he only had the strength of a Fighter 3-dan. If he were to rush to an elder to ask for a 6-dan cultivation technique now, he might end up being researched like a guinea pig. Many troubles will grow out of it.Furthermore, even with the approval of the other party, with just one copy... He is still unable to cultivate!Based on the first 5 dan of Hongtian Nine Dan Formula, this cultivation technique possesses too many flaws. Without the cross references from numerous other cultivation technique to seek the correct cultivation method, there wouldn't be any results in his training even if he were to train non-stop for several years.To him, the most pressing matter at hand is to seek a huge pile of Fighter 6-dan cultivation techniques and draw comparisons among them to deduce the correct cultivation method\"Un, I've heard that quite a bit of trading is done in Tianxuan Royal City and cultivation techniques are one of the goods that are being traded. It would solve quite a bit of problem if I am able to purchase a few 6-dan cultivation techniques!\"Suddenly, upon recalling something, Zhang Xuan's eyes light up.Hongtian Academy is located in the capital of Tianxuan Kingdom, Tianxuan Royal City. Tianxuan Royal City is an extraordinarily prosperous city. With numerous large commercial cities in here, all kinds of trade are carried out here. 6-dan cultivation techniques may be rare, but it is still sold in numerous shops here.Furthermore, to Zhang Xuan, there isn't really a need for him to buy them. As long as he manages to flip through them, it would be as good as gaining possession of the secret manual.With the Library of Heaven's Path, the quality and price of the secret manual no longer matter. As long as there is sufficient quantity, he would be able to derive the correct path out of the innumerable errors, and the Heaven's Path Divine Art would be automatically compiled, thus allowing him to cultivate swiftly.\"It is still early. Let's see if I am able to get a few books today!\"At this point, Zhang Xuan stops hesitating and stands up immediately.The sun has just set and the nightlife has just begun. Since he is free anyway, it is a good opportunity to stroll through the commercial cities. Perhaps, he might find some useful items.Tianyu Commercial City is the largest trading market in Tianxuan City. It is said that as long as one possesses sufficient money, he is able to buy everything he desires here.Stepping into the market, Zhang Xuan feels his vision blurring from the sight of the innumerable goods laid out before him.His previous self was just an ordinary teacher. His wages were low and he was treated poorly. As a result, he had never been to such a grand place before. Thus, Zhang Xuan finds himself incapable of identifying most of the goods on sale here.There are many small vendors in the commercial city. A vendor sits in front of each of these booths and all kinds of goods are laid out before them.Weapons, pills, herbs, armor, beast skin, beast pills...Almost everything that is required for cultivation can be found here.Just that, there are too many of them. It is difficult to ascertain which of them are of superior quality and which of them are of inferior quality.\"I might be unable to discern between the good and bad, but the Library of Heaven's Path might be capable of it!\"Such a thought flashes through his mind. Thus, Zhang Xuan immediately walks over to a booth.\"This gentleman here, what are you looking for? I have everything you need here and I guarantee your satisfaction with my goods!\" The vendor quickly welcomes his presence.\"I'll just take a casual look!\" Zhang Xuan smiles. He casually picks up an object in the booth.It is a circular bell of average size.\"This bell is specially forged by a blacksmith and has extraordinary abilities. It is on sale for just 50 gold coins. I can assure you that the price is fair. I offer the very same price to everyone passing by! If you're interested in it, I can give you a special discount... It'll be yours for just 20 gold coins!\"The vendor coaxes.Zhang Xuan doesn't respond to his words. Rather, he twirls the bell around his hand.Weng!The library in his mind jolts and a book appears in it.\"Reprise Bell. It is able to generate the same tune over and over again, causing one to feel dizzy-headed. It is effective against Fighter 1-dan. It is created by a 1-mo craftsman of Blue Cloud Workshop. It is made of Wujin Metal...\"\"Flaws: No. 1, the duration required for the reprise sound to take effect is long, requiring at least an incense's time, making it an ineffective weapon in battle. No. 2, it doesn't differentiate in its attacks, the wielder will take damage from it as well...\"~15 minute\"Indeed, it is possible!\" Zhang Xuan smiles.It doesn't matter even if he is unfamiliar with all these items. As long as he touches them with his hands and picks them up, the library would compile a corresponding book on it!Furthermore, this book details the history, composition and all kinds of flaws of the item in question comprehensively. With just a single look, it is apparent to see if the item is valuable or not.Those who are unaware of the truth might just buy it with the vendor's previous offer of 20 gold coins. Only by looking at the contents recorded in the book does Zhang Xuan realize that this toy isn't even worth 2 gold coins!What specially forged by a blacksmith... Blue Cloud Workshop is an organization that specializes in the production of fake goods.Furthermore, 1-mo craftsmen are the ones with the worst craftsmanship of them all.Those who specializes in the creation of goods and handicraft are termed as craftsmen. They are classified into 9 mo, with 1-mo being the worst and 9-mo being the best.How valuable can a creation of a 1-mo craftsman be?\"With the library here, I won't have to worry about purchasing fake goods...\"Zhang Xuan chuckles.This world is similar to his previous one. With authentic goods come imitations and given his previous ability of discernment, needless to say, the authentic ones, he might not even be able to tell the strengths and weaknesses of an imitation. However, with the assistance of the library, he doesn't have to worry about it anymore.Just that, he needs to come into contact with the item for a book to be compiled on it. The number of items in this market total up to at least ten million. If he had to touch every single one of them, wouldn't he tire himself to death?Besides, if he were to just look at the goods, he wouldn't attract much attention. However, if he touches everything he catches his sight on, it probably won't take long for the security enforcement team of the commercial city to think of him as a lunatic and drive him out of the city.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: Frigid Sun Mother GrassTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Right, do you sell Frigid Sun Grass here?\"Shaking his head to dispel the additional thoughts in his mind, Zhang Xuan asks.On top of miscellaneous items, this vendor also sells some herbs.After finishing those books in the Compendium Pavilion, he has already found a solution to Zhao Ya's problem. With a Pure Yin Body, she should cultivate a gentle and neutral cultivation technique. This way, the problem of the accumulation of yin energy should be solved!However, she has already cultivated a pure yin cultivation technique for a long time and the meridians in her body have already adapted to it. If an abrupt change were to be introduced, her body might sustain a severe trauma and her cultivation will fall steeply. To prevent this from occurring, some preparations have to be made in advance!One of them is to nourish her meridians through medicinal herbs!Frigid Sun Grass grows in cold regions despite favoring sunny conditions. As a result, the warm and cold spiritual energy contained within it clashes, causing the amalgamation of yin and yang, thus making it the ideal choice to nourish her meridians. Since he is in the commercial city now, it is a good time for him to ask around about it.\"Frigid Sun Grass? It is a coincidence that you ask this. Not to brag, but I can guarantee you that I am the only vendor in Tianyu Commercial City that has this good. I procured them a few days ago from a dangerous region in Tianxuan Forest. I have a total of ten stalks and each stalk costs 100 gold coins. How many do you need?\"The vendor smiles and turns around to take out a box. Opening it, a few fresh-looking plants are revealed within.White flowers with red stems and leaves.\"Let me take a look first!\"Zhang Xuan only knows about the Frigid Sun Grass through books, so he isn't very familiar with it. He reaches out to grab a stalk and places it on his palm.Weng!The library jolts and a book appears.\"Frigid Sun Grass, harvested from an unknown valley 200km into Tianxuan Forest. Aged 2... Flaws...\"The name of the herb is written on the cover of the book and the location of its procurement and its flaws are recorded in it.\"It is Frigid Sun Grass, this fellow isn't lying!\"Confirming that there is no mistake with the name on the book, Zhang Xuan knows that the vendor owner isn't lying to him. This is the authentic medicinal herb, so he nods his head. Just when he is about to speak, his eyes happen to glance on the interiors of the box.\"Why does this stalk of Frigid Sun Grass look slightly withered? Could it be that your procurement method is incorrect, causing its death?\"There is a specific method to harvesting medicinal herbs. If the method if wrong, the medicinal properties of the herb might be lost, causing its price to dip steeply.The stalk of Frigid Sun Grass he is talking about is withered thin and slightly yellow, seemingly immature. Furthermore, it doesn't look fresh at all. With a shriveled large head, it seems as though it would die at any moment\"This gentleman here must be joking. I depend on this for a living, so how could I possibly get it wrong! This stalk of herb isn't of good condition from the very start, it was already like that when I procured it initially. If you want it, I will sell it to you at half price, 5o gold coins!\"The vendor says.\"Un!\"Zhang Xuan picks up the yellowish and withered stalk of Frigid Sun Grass.Weng!\"Frigid Sun Mother Grass, the origin of other Frigid Sun Grasses. harvested from an unknown valley 200km into Tianxuan Forest. Aged 15...\" Flipping open the book, the name of the herb and details on it is recorded.\"Frigid Sun Mother Grass?\" Zhang Xuan's eyes light up.He has read it on the books previously. This extremely valuable and rare herb is the core of all other Frigid Sun Grass. If this herb were to be used in the creation of a medicine, its effectiveness would at least be ten times of the latter!He didn't expect to stumble upon this treasure when he was just casually looking for herbs. Furthermore, this herb is 15 year old. Just by this itself determines the extraordinary worth of it.If Zhao Ya were to use the Frigid Sun Grass to nourish her meridians, she would still require the augmentation from several other means to successfully change her cultivation technique. However, with this stalk of Frigid Sun Grass, the problem can be easily solved. She wouldn't even need the augmentation from other means!This is the most suitable medicinal herb for her, no questions about it!\"Wrap this stalk up for me!\"Although he is agitated, his face still remains expressionless as he casually passes it back to the vendor.If the other party realizes that this is a mother stalk and not a sickly one, its price would instantly shoot up by ten times and even so, he might still be unable to purchase it from him!As a Four Haves Youngster who grew up in the modern civilized world, he wouldn't do himself any injustice when he is able to profit out of something.Four Haves refer to Dream, Moral, Culture and Discipline. Originated from Deng Xiao Ping in 1980.\"50 gold coins!\"Seeing how well-dressed the young man seem to be, he thought that he would purchase a few stalk. He didn't expect that he would just buy a sickly one. Pursing his lips, he wraps it casually, the warmth from before absent on his face.Even a vendor judges his own customers when doing sales. The person before him isn't even willing to buy a good medicinal herb, thus making it clear to see that he is a poor bloke. Since that's the case, it would just be a waste of time to try to coax him otherwise.\"Alright!\"Grabbing the herb, Zhang Xuan reaches out to his pocket and awkwardness immediately shows on his face.Due to being too absorbed in the library, he forgot about the matter of money... As a low-level teacher, his wages are low. Furthermore, due to scoring a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination, his fortunes were penalized severely... In other words, he doesn't even have 10 gold coins in his pocket, needless to say, 50.\"Is there anything wrong?\" Sensing that something is amiss from his face, the vendor asks.\"Cough cough, can you... sell it to me for eight gold coins?\" Zhang Xuan counts the gold coins he retrieves from his pocket and there are only eight of them.\"Eight? You must be joking! Since you didn't bring any money, why are you trying to buy anything at all...\"Seeing the few coins placed on the other party's palm, the vendor owner is on the verge of doing a somersault and crashing to the floor.He had met with miserly customers, but he had never met with such a miserly one!Trying to buy Frigid Sun Grass with just eight gold coins? You must be dreaming! Even if this stalk is sickly, it is still worth far beyond this priceSnatching back the herb, he waves his hand with an annoyed look, \"Scram if you don't have any money. I don't have the effort to be arguing with you over this!\"\"Cough cough! It is true that I didn't bring sufficient money, but are you sure that you don't want to sell it to me?\"Seeing the attitude of the vendor, Zhang Xuan shakes his head.\"Nonsense! Even if this stalk looks awful, it still contains medicinal properties. At worst, it can still be sold for 30 or 40 gold coins. Yet, you offer me eight gold coins? What a joke! Hurry up and leave, or else I will be calling for the security enforcement team!\"Seeing how this fellow is reluctant to leave despite being broke, he angrily chases him away.In order to prevent people from coercing others to buy or sell goods, as well as to deter troublemakers, most large commercial cities operate a security enforcement patrol team in their perimeter. As long as one calls out for them, they would appear quickly. Even if you are a Fighter 5-dan Dingli realm expert, you will be chased out of the commercial city instantly!Furthermore, to make a move on the security enforcement team means to make a move on the entire commercial city. Normally, no one would have the guts to stand up against them.Upon seeing how this fellow refuses to leave despite not possessing sufficient money, he is certain that he is here to cause trouble. So, he opens his mouth to call for the security enforcement team.\"Don't call for the security enforcement team, I'm really interested in buying it!\" Zhang Xuan interrupts him. With a calm and steady look, he chuckles softly, \"I might not have sufficient money, but I'm not here to cause trouble. Do you believe that if I were to open my mouth, not only will you be willing to sell it to me, you would even offer to give it to me for free?\"\"Give it to you for free? Are you still in the midst of your sleep?\"The vendor didn't expect the poor bloke to say such words. He looks at the young man before him with an attitude as though he is looking at an idiot and sneers coldly, \"If I were to really give it to you for free, I'll call you grandpa!\"In his opinion, this fellow must have a screw loose. Not mentioning how he doesn't bring sufficient money to purchase goods, he even thinks that he would give it to him for free...I am not insane, why would I give it to you for free?Who do you think you are!\"Call me grandpa? You don't need to do that!\" Zhang Xuan shakes his head. He looks at the vendor with a bright smile and says, \"You will give it to me for free because I said so. If you doubt my words... I will take two steps... Cough cough, let's see what will happen after I give you a punch!\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: The Master is HereTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&TortexThe Master is Here\u201cGive me a punch?\u201d The vendor doesn't know what the young man is up to.\u201cIndeed!\u201d Zhang Xuan nods his head.\u201cYou are trying to make a fool out of me!\u201d Seeing the serious look on the other person's face, the vendor's rage come surging out and he sends a fist towards Zhang Xuan.He had seen crazy people before, but he had never seen such a crazy person. You still want me to let you give me a punch? Why don't I beat you up to death instead?Putting all of his strength into his punch routine, the wind rustles from the force of his blow, thus exposing his level of cultivation. Fighter 3-dan Zhenqi realm primary stage!\u201cNot bad!\u201dSmiling faintly, Zhang Xuan moves his body slightly to dodge the attack.He has already reached Fighter 5-dan Dingli realm pinnacle. Naturally, the strength of a Fighter 3-dan primary stage cannot hurt him!\u201cUn?\u201dHe assumed that the young man is here just to cause trouble, so he thought that he would just be a delinquent without cultivation. However, upon seeing him dodge his attack easily, he immediately realizes that the young man's cultivation is on a higher level than his. The vendor stops as bewilderment overwhelms him. A fellow who has at least reached the level of Fighter 3-dan can't possibly be really trying to buy stuff with just 8 gold coins\u2026\u201cIf I'm not wrong, you are from Xia Pingyi!\u201dThe moment the vendor made a move, a book on him is compiled in the Library of Heaven's Path. Getting what he had intended for, Zhang Xuan smiles faintly.\u201cHow\u2026 How did you know?\u201d The vendor is taken aback.Xia Pingyi is one of the provincial cities around Tianxuan Royal City. It isn't a large city and there are at least eighty of such cities around the capital. The vendor is puzzled by how Zhang Xuan could pinpoint it out accurately.He couldn't resist looking down to study his appearance, but there doesn't seem to be any defining traits on him that would reveal his place of origin!\u201cIt doesn't matter how I know it!\u201d Zhang Xuan activates this acting cool mode. He looks at the other party once again in a calm and dignified demeanor, \u201cHalf a year ago, you probably met with danger in Tianxuan Forest and was bitten by a \u3010Cold Bamboo Snake\u3011! Although you managed to escape with your life, your kidneys were damaged. If I'm not wrong\u2026 When you are doing that, it is difficult for you to showcase your masculinity!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026 You\u2026\u201dThe vendor staggers backward. His eyes are widened so large that they are on the verge of falling to the floor.It is true that he was bitten by a Cold Bamboo Snake in Tianxuan Forest half a year ago! After which\u2026 The latter half of Zhang Xuan's words are true as well.However, other than him and the lady from the brothel, he had never talked about it with another person. How did this young man know about it?Could it be that he is a seer? Someone who is capable of divining the future?The vendor is still filled with disbelief.\u201cWhy? Are my words wrong?\u201d Seeing the expression on the other party's face, Zhang Xuan knew that what was written in the Library of Heaven's Path isn't wrong. Thus, he expresses a look of pity and says, \u201cIf you find what I have said inaccurate, I can do without the medicinal herb and leave right now. However\u2026 Your only chance at treating your problem will disappear as well! Sigh, you won't be able to be a man from now onward, don't blame me for not reminding you now\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2026 Gongzi, don't go!\u201dGongzi -> GentlemanHearing that the other party is capable of treating him, the vendor's body trembles in agitation as he hurriedly takes a step forward, \u201cYou\u2026 Can you really treat me?\u201dTo a man, nothing is more pathetic than losing one's potency. These days, he dares not respond to the invitations of his friends, afraid that his problem would be exposed in front of them. Suffering silently, he had looked for many different physicians, but they all came to the same conclusion, that his symptoms are hard to treat and the only solution is amputation\u2026He dares not believe that a casual buyer would point out his problem directly and even claim that he is capable of treating it.\u201cI won't force you to believe me! However, since I am able to tell what is wrong with you, naturally, I have my own ways to treat it as well!\u201d Zhang Xuan declares.\u201cGongzi, I plead you to help treat me. As long as you can treat me\u2026 Not just that single stalk of Frigid Sun Grass, you can take all of my herbs!\u201d The vendor lunges forward in a panic, the plea in his eyes clear to see.There are too many incredible people in the world. The words of the young man are logical since he is able to see through his problem, he definitely has a way to treat it!Besides, he has no choice to grasp onto every straw of hope that he could find. After all, this concerns his future happiness\u2026\u201cUn, you were bitten by the Cold Bamboo Snake. This creature inherently possesses cold attribute. When you were bitten by it, cold energy irrupted into your body, causing you to lose your physical function! Furthermore, it is unable to dispel by any medicinal herb, thus even quite a few apothecaries will find themselves helpless before it!\u201d\u201cHowever, what is bizarre about this snake is that even though its entire body is cold, its gall is warm. As long as you find another snake, kill it and consume its gall, you are able to expel the cold energy from your body completely. Your damaged kidney would gradually recover and you would be able to showcase your masculinity as a man once more!\u201dZhang Xuan says.There are many antidotes to the poison of the Cold Bamboo Snake, but the best antidote of all lies on its body. Its gall is the crux to counteracting its unique cold energy.This is written on one of the manuals in Hongtian Compendium Pavilion. Upon the thought of Cold Bamboo Snakes, this information pops up into his mind.This is also precisely the reason why he only mentioned the gall bladder of the Cold Bamboo Snake. Otherwise, with the Library of Heaven's Path capability of displaying innumerable flaws, there is a multitude of remedies he could provide him, he need not specifically choose this one.\u201cEating the snake gall of a Cold Bamboo Snake?\u201d The vendor is still in a state of disbelief.So simple?If this is true, why did none of the many physicians he had visited say so?\u201cThere should be Cold Bamboo Snakes on sale in this commercial city. If you doubt my words, you can buy one of them and try it right now. I will only leave after we verify it!\u201d Zhang Xuan says.Medicinal herbs aren't the only things on sale in Tianyu Commercial City, there are also all kinds of treasures, savage beasts and animals. Cold Bamboo Snake is one of the lower tier savage beasts. Although it contains lethal poison within it, it can be used in concocting medicines, so there are people selling it here.\u201cFine, wait for a moment\u2026\u201dAfter hesitating for a moment, the vendor turns around and leaves. A short moment later, he returns with a cage and a Cold Bamboo Snake is coiling around in it.As a Zhenqi realm fighter, as long as he is prepared, killing a Cold Bamboo Snake isn't a difficult task. It didn't take long for the snake gall to be extracted. Without any hesitation, the vendor swallows it directly.\u201cUn?\u201dSoon, the vendor's eyes light up.The vendor seems to have already gotten an answer to whether the remedy works or not.\u201cI thank gongzi for your help. These Frigid Sun Grass are all yours!\u201d With his eyes glowing with excitement, the vendor nearly kneels down in gratitude from the joy surging through him.This was a problem that had been plaguing him for a long time. In fact, there was even a period when he didn't want to live anymore. In order to treat this deficiency of his, he spent several years of his savings and never would he expect for it to be treated just like that!\u201cSee, I didn't lie when I said that you would give them to me for free!\u201dZhang Xuan helps himself to the generous gifts of the vendor and grabs the box filled with Frigid Sun Grasses.Knowledge is a type of wealth as well. It is natural for Zhang Xuan to receive some compensation from the vendor after solving the illness that was plaguing him.\u201cGongzi, I apologize for my inadequacy for not realizing your capabilities\u2026 I beg for your forgiveness!\u201d The vendor scratches his head in embarrassment.Just a moment ago, he was still declaring resolutely that if he were to give the Frigid Sun Grasses to Zhang Xuan for free, he would call him grandpa. Never would he expect for Zhang Xuan's words to truly come to be\u2026\u201cIt's nothing!\u201d Zhang Xuan casually waves his hand to show that it was a small matter. Just as he is about to leave, a crowd of people suddenly dashes forward, their faces red from agitation.\u201cQuick, Master Mo Yang is here!\u201d\u201cOne would be able to prosper through the guidance of Master Mo Yang. This is an opportunity not to be missed!\u201d\u201cThis time, as long as it is a treasure Master Mo Yang appraises for me, I will buy it no matter how much it costs!\u201d\u201cIndeed, I felt regretful after missing that opportunity by the previous time\u2026\u201d\u2026The crowds discuss as they ran over.\u201cWhat is happening?\u201dSeeing how the crowds are agitated as though a star has arrived, Zhang Xuan is puzzled.\u201cMaster Mo Yang has come!\u201d Even the eyes of the vendor are glowing with excitement.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Treasure SpeculationTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\u201cIs that Master Mo Yang you all speak of that incredible?\u201d Zhang Xuan asks doubtfully.To be capable of inciting the agitation of so many people, causing them to go into a frenzy, who is this Master Mo Yang? Just what kind of magical abilities does he possess?\u201cYes, he is extremely incredible!\u201d Reverence can be heard from the vendor's tone. \u201cHe is an expert appraiser!\u201d\u201cAppraiser?\u201d Zhang Xuan nods his head.Appraiser and gourmet are both special occupations. However, the former is a Middle Nine Paths occupation.This occupation may not be as glorious as apothecaries, blacksmiths and formation masters, but it is capable of sending innumerable people into hysteria.That is because they are able to tell whether an item is a treasure or not just by looking at it. In the field of \u3010Treasure Speculation\u3011, they possess golden fingers that make them an existence similar to the God of Gambling. Many people would follow behind reverently them the moment they appear in public.Treasure speculation is a commercial activity similar to Earth's rock speculation. There are some ancient treasures whose original radiance is buried under the cloak of rock and faunas. Just by the outer appearance itself, the most one could do is to identify what the artifact is. It is impossible to tell the tier of the treasure and the specifications of it.Rock speculation, information on it left on the bottom.Its true form will only be revealed when the exterior of the artifact is cleaned!There are many treasure dealers who choose not to clean up these treasures and sell them in such a form instead. This is similar to the concept of rock gambling. After which, the buyer would purchase the artifact based on their discernment ability and intuition and clean up its exterior afterward.If they are lucky, it might turn out to be a supreme treasure which would make them millionaires in an instant. On the other hand, it is also possible for them to go bankrupt after investing greatly on some useless object!Heaven on one side and hell on the other.It is due to the very unpredictability of the game that many people are obsessed with it, sometimes even going crazy over it.Appraisers are capable of ascertaining whether a treasure is real or not. Those who are more capable are even able to make a judgment on an artifact before it has been tidied up. Thus, even though the occupation is only of the Middle Nine Paths, the charms of it has attracted many to walk on such a road.After all, it is the Midas's touch. As long as they think that it is a treasure, people would buy it no matter how expensive they are.\u201cThis Master Mo Yang arrived here seven days ago. It is rumored that he is an incredible appraiser from some other kingdom. However, back then, no one paid him any notice!\u201dThe vendor introduces Master Mo Yang excitedly. \u201cThe first day, when someone wanted to buy a wine bottle-like object that costs about 100 gold coin, Master Mo Yang tried to persuade him otherwise. However, that person refused to listen and in the end, after wiping it clean, it is proven that there is a problem with the object and it isn't worth a single gold coin!\u201d\u201cThe second day, Master Mo Yang persuaded a fighter to spend 200 gold coins to buy a treasure. That person refused to believe him, so he didn't buy it. Thus, Master Mo Yang bought it himself and after it is wiped clean, it turned out to be a mortal pinnacle weapon! It is something that cannot be bought even with several thousand gold coins! He profited several dozen folds in an instant! That filled the fighter with so much regret that the thought of suicide even crossed his mind\u2026\u201d\u201cBy the third day, he was already very famous. There are many people who wanted his guidance on what they should buy. However, only a lucky lad was granted that opportunity. He advised him to buy a small jade bottle that is worth 500 gold coins! At that moment, many people thought that he had erred. No matter how incredible that jade vase is, it can't possibly be worth such a sum\u2026 Who knew that the moment it is opened, six tier 6 pills were found inside! Someone even offered to buy that vase for 10000 gold coins on the spot!\u201dThe vendor's eyes light up, \u201cThat is to say, a profit of twenty-fold! That is too incredible! The next few days, he came by the market every day and he only advised a single person on each day. Even so, the person that he chooses is certain strike it rich! Many people went frenzied over this. Thus, they started to camp here from day to night, hoping to win his favor so that he would offer them his pointer! Now that he's here again, it is not abnormal for those people to be so agitated\u2026\u201d\u201cAmazing!\u201dHearing the story of Master Mo Yang, Zhang Xuan's eyes light up as he nods his head in approval.To be able to appraise the true worth of a treasure under a layer of moss and silt, his eye for discernment must be extraordinary.\u201cUn, that's right. I possess the Library of Heaven's Path, so does it mean that\u2026 I am able to do it as well?\u201dZhang Xuan's eyes light up.The Library of Heaven's Path allows one to see through the true nature of things just by coming into contact with it. Other people might need some luck in treasure speculation, but he doesn't need such a thing!\u201cThere is an easy way for me to strike it rich!\u201dUpon such thoughts, Zhang Xuan is unable to calm his agitated heart.In rock speculation, before buying a rock, others would need to study the various aspects of the rock to deduce whether jade would come out of it. However, Zhang Xuan is different. Just by touching the artifact with his hands, the Library of Heaven's Path in his mind would automatically generate an answer for him. Purchasing the artifact after knowing the answer, it would be a simple matter for him to profit out of this trade!It just happens to his wages are low and he didn't have much money. So, this is a good opportunity for him to give it a try to earn a sum!Following the directions given by the vendor, Zhang Xuan soon arrived at the hall where treasure speculation is conducted.As he expected, the sight in here isn't much different from rock speculation. All kinds of treasures are placed on an elevated platform and every single one of them are thickly covered by a layer of moss, silt, rust and rock. It is already a difficult task to make out the shape of the artifacts, needless to say, appraise its value.\u201cLet me give it a try first!\u201dIt is true that Zhang Xuan is unable to discern between them just by sight alone. Although Zhang Xuan suspects that the Library of Heaven's Path is able to peer into the true nature of the artifact, he is unable to ascertain it. Thus, to verify his theory, he casually touches an artifact that is about the size of a human's head.Weng!His mind jolts and a book appears in the library.\u201cOrnamental Vase, forged by a 1-mo craftsman from Southern Kiln. Flaws: It has cracks on it and could shatter at any moment\u2026\u201dThe description of the artifact is compiled into a book.\u201cDespite being massive, it turned out to be a trash!\u201d Zhang Xuan comments impassively as his eyes glitter in excitement.Just as he thought! As long as he comes into physical contact with it, he is able to receive a detailed introduction on the artifact. Thus, he need not fear no matter how well-hidden these treasures are, he would surely be able to identify them accurately!He casually touches a few of the larger artifacts before him and realizes that none of them are of great value. He continues on with a dozen of the artifacts by the sides, but they aren't really valuable either. Zhang Xuan can't help but shake his head. It is no wonder the sellers of these artifacts are able to profit out of it and that appraisers are so well-received, the probability of a true treasure appearing among them is way too low!\u201cAh, master, please give me some pointers!\u201d\u201cI am willing to pay you for your advice!\u201d\u201cMaster, I'm begging you\u2026\u201d\u2026Just as he is randomly touching the treasures casually, piercing screams echo outside the hall as the sought-after Master Mo Yang walks over.The eyes of those chasing behind him are crimson red, and they look as though they have gone mad.\u201cMaster, as long as you offer me your pointer, this young girl will obey every single command of yours\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster, I am willing to bear your babies, as long as you guide me\u2026\u201dThere are even women who are sticking close to him, trying to seduce him with their physical charms.Zhang Xuan is flabbergasted.He is way too popular! It seems as though with a single word of Master Mo Yang, countless girls would be willing to serve him tonight.\u201cI will be leaving Tianxuan Royal City tonight. In order to show my gratitude for the warmth everyone has welcomed me with, I will appraise for five people today! You all need not vie over it. There is a chance for everyone who is fated with me!\u201dUpon reaching the treasure speculation hall, Master Mo Yang stops.This Master Mo Yang has a snowy-white beard, which exposes his advanced age. Yet, his skin is smooth and shiny without a single crease on it, probably because he maintained his skin diligently. His eyes have an aura of superiority, making one feel inadequate in comparison. As such, no one is willing to meet his gaze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Master, why don't you stay for a few more days?\u201d\u201cWhy are you leaving so soon?\u201dHearing that the master was about to depart from the city, looks of anxiety appeared on the faces of the crowd.[It is rare for an appraiser to appear in Tianxuan Royal City, and yet he is leaving just after a few days?]\u201cI still have matters to attend to!\u201d Master Mo Yang's eyebrows shot upwards. He carried with him a demeanor unique to experts, and his disposition was reminiscent of a flowing river, unable to be grasped with certainty. \u201cHow about this, I will increase the number of treasures I will appraise today from five to ten! You all also know that appraising isn't an easy task, it drains one's strength and energy. Ten is already my limit\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster, rest assured! As long as you help me pick out an artifact for me, I am willing to compensate you\u2026\u201d A middle-aged man shouted from the crowd.\u201cYeah, we are willing to compensate you!\u201d\u201cAs long as master chooses something out for me, regardless of the cost of the item is, I am willing to pay master the same amount of money!\u201dThere were quite a few people who started yelling in response to his words.Based on the 'battle records' of the master, those who had received his pointers had each earned several folds of the amount they had invested initially. As long as they were able to obtain a true treasure, paying a little bit of money in compensation was nothing in comparison.\u201cHmph!\u201dMaster Mo Yang flung his arm and interrupted the discussions of the crowd. Frowning, he declared with an aura of superiority, \u201cI, Mo Yang, didn't learn appraisal for money. The reason why I am appraising for you all is not to make a wealth! If I really desired money, there is no need for me to help you all. I just have to appraise an artifact and sell it myself, then won't I earn a bigger fortune that way?\u201d\u201cKeng\u2026\u201dThe crowd was stumped for words.His words weren't wrong. With his eye of discernment, he could just buy those artifacts that he had appraised to become treasures for himself, and he would be able to easily earn a big sum out of it.\u201cThe reason why I promised to appraise for you all is because your warmth has moved me! Money is fleeting to me, similar to the clouds! Money is easy to earn, but friendship is priceless!\u201dWith both his hands behind his back, Master Mo Yang exuded an aura of an unworldly saint that mortals could only look up to. He continued, \u201cThe reason why I promised to appraise artifacts for you all is because of our relationship, not for money. If anyone were to continue talking about money, then don't bother asking me to appraise for you!\u201d\u201cMaster, your words are wise! We were too impertinent!\u201d\u201cWe can never hope to match up the master in terms of morals!\u201d\u201cI have never conceded to anyone in my entire life. Today, you are the first one I will concede to, master!\u201d\u2026Hearing the words of the master, those who were shouting about paying him previously felt ashamed of themselves.[Look at how he carries himself, then look at ourselves\u2026Is there even a basis for comparison?No wonder he is a master while we are just small fries.]\u201cHowever, before I start appraising for you all, I would like to say something. An appraiser can only heighten the possibility of attaining a treasure. I cannot promise you all that you all will get a treasure with 100% probability!\u201dMaster Mo Yang continued.\u201cMaster, we all are aware that treasure speculation brings about risk. Your ability to discern treasure from trash is far superior to us and we trust in you!\u201d\u201cWe believe in master's judgment!\u201d\u201cWe know the rules, how can one possibly lay their hands on treasures all the time? However, we believe that master would definitely be able to help us profit!\u201d\u2026Everyone started shouting simultaneously.\u201cSince everyone believes in me, then I will go ahead and embarrass myself. May I know which friend here would like me to choose an artifact for him?\u201d Master Mo Yang surveyed the surrounding.\u201cMe!\u201d\u201cMe\u2026\u201dIn an instant, innumerable people raised their hands and leapt about in excitement.The appeal of an appraiser was clear to see. Every action of theirs could make people go into frenzy.\u201cAlright, you!\u201dMaster Mo Yang pointed, and a pot-bellied middle-aged man walked out from the crowd, still unable to believe the fact that he had been chosen. \u201cMe\u2026 Is it really me?\u201d\u201cIt's you!\u201d Master Mo Yang nodded his head with a smile on his face, the aura of a master clearly exuding through his actions.\u201cThank you, master!\u201dThe middle-aged man leapt in excitement as he stared at the elder before him with a desirous gaze. \u201cMaster, may I ask which one of them I should buy?\u201d\u201cLet me take a look!\u201dFlinging his sleeves, he walked forward. He calmly gazed upon the numerous artifacts placed on the platform.The crowd turned silent along with his actions, not daring to speak out loud for fear of distracting him.Soon, he stopped and placed his palm on one of the artifacts. After feeling the exterior of the artifact gently, he seemed to use some kind of special technique that resulted in the shuddering of his entire body. A moment later, his face paled slightly.\u201cAlright, you can buy this one. I have just taken a look at it with my special technique and it is worth quite a sum!\u201dMaster Mo Yang turned around and informed the middle-aged man.\u201cThis one?\u201dThe eyes of the middle-aged man lit up and he rushed forward to take a look.It was a gigantic treasure that had been enveloped by a thick layer of rock, to the point that the entire artifact simply looked like a giant boulder.This kind of treasure was the hardest to clean. Furthermore, given its massive size, being around the height of a human, it would take at least a day or two to chip the stone off of it carefully.\u201cUn!\u201d Master Mo Yang nodded his head.\u201cSince it is a recommendation by the master, I will buy it!\u201d The middle-aged man nodded his head and looked towards the dealer. \u201cHow much does it cost?\u201d\u201c50000 gold coins!\u201d The dealer of the treasure speculation hall stepped forward.\u201c50000?\u201d The middle-aged man was taken aback.This wasn't a small sum. Even despite the great wealth he possessed, it was about the limit of what he can come up with.Even a popular high-level teacher like Shen Bi Ru only earned around 1000 gold coins every month. She would take several years just to reach 50000.\u201cBuy it! This is a recommendation by the master. If you don't want it, I will take it\u2026\u201d Upon seeing his hesitation, someone in the crowd shouted.\u201cIndeed, the master's recommendation can't possibly go wrong. It might cost 50000 now, but if it is worth 1000000 after it has been cleaned up, then you would have landed on a gold mine\u2026\u201d\u201cThe previous few times, the treasures that the master appraised were of smaller scale. This time, he seems to have decided to go all out. You really struck it big this time\u2026\u201dQuite a few people shouted out.\u201cAlright, I will buy it!\u201dAfter hesitating for a moment, the middle-aged man nodded his head and footed the bill.\u201cAlright, the second one!\u201dAfter the middle-aged man bought the artifact, Master Mo Yang seemed to have also recovered from his exertion and surveyed the surroundings once more.\u201cMe!\u201d\u201cMe\u2026\u201dThe rest of the crowd raised their hands hurriedly. Glancing over, Zhang Xuan noticed the vendor from before whom he had helped solve his problem in the crowd. His hand was raised up high and he waved it with an enthusiastic expression, his strong desire to be chosen by the master clear to see.\u201cYou!\u201dMaster Mo Yang chose another person. This time, it was an elderly who was dressed extravagantly. With just a single look, it is apparent that he owned great wealth.Similar to the first time, the master walked past the pile of treasures and soon set his sights upon one of it.\u201c80000 gold coins!\u201dThis treasure was even more expensive than the one from before. However, this elderly didn't even hesitate and immediately paid the bill.\u201cThis\u2026 Isn't this the Ornamental Vase crafted by a 1-mo craftsman from the Southern Kiln? 80000 gold coins?\u201dAfter taking a good look at the treasure Master Mo Yang chose for the elder, Zhang Xuan blinked his eyes in disbelief.He might be unable to ascertain the value of the other treasures, given that he had yet to take a look at them, but he had already peered into the one Master Mo Yang just chose. It might be big, but only a decorative vase was contained inside. It wasn't even worth a single gold coin and yet\u2026 80000 gold coins?\u201cCould he be off the mark\u2026\u201dJust as puzzlement filled his mind, Zhang Xuan couldn't help but stare at the righteous-looking face of the master when his mind suddenly jolted and a book appeared in the library.The words 'Mo Yang' was written on it.\u201cCould he be using a battle technique at the moment?\u201dBased on the unique properties of the Library of Heaven's Path, a book could only be compiled when one showcases his battle technique. Could it be that the fellow was using one at the current moment?Filled with bewilderment, he flipped open the book.\u201cThis\u2026 This\u2026\u201dTaking a look at it, Zhang Xuan's lip twitched and a bizarre expression appeared on his face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

A scammer in Liuzhu Kingdom who made his name as an appraiser, notorious for his frauds to earn wealth and the favor of women!\u201d\u201cBattle Techniques: Voice of Allurement (Rookie). Beguile the mind of others through words, making it easier to convince them!\u201d\u201cFlaws: No. 1, outlawed by the royalty of Liuzhu Kingdom. No.2\u2026\u201dZhang Xuan didn't know whether he should laugh or cry.To think that the fellow who had the appearance and disposition of an expert would turn out to be a scammer! For a moment back there, even Zhang Xuan thought that he was an amazing figure!Looks like there were quite a few people in the crowd that were his men. The dealer selling the artifacts must be an accomplice of his as well. They worked together to build up his fame out of appraising treasures, so that they could convince people to buy useless trash at a high price, thus profiting out of it.\u201cIf there is someone conducting a fraud, there must be someone that would be tricked as well!\u201dDespite knowing that the other party was a fraudster, Zhang Xuan had no intentions to expose him at all.Firstly, he didn't have the evidence to prove it. The matter with the Library of Heaven's Path must not be exposed at all costs! Secondly, those who had been scammed by him had already lost their rationality. If he were to try to convince them that he is a fraudster, it was possible that he might end up getting lynched by them.Zhang Xuan would never do deeds that did not benefit him, not to mention that it would bring him a string of troubles.\u201cForget it. I think I will just look through and buy my own items!\u201dCouldn't be bothered with the 'Master Mo Yang' who was busy trying to act cool by putting on an 'expert's demeanor', Zhang Xuan continued to browse through the treasures placed on the platform, casually touching them as he passed by them.A book would be compiled in his mind as long as he came into physical contact with the item. Although the prices of the item weren't reflected in the library, the items with fewer flaws were definitely of higher value.After touching forty to fifty items, he realized that there was not a single valuable one among them. The absurdly low possibility of finding a treasure in the mix made him shudder.\u201cThe final chance will be given to\u2026 you!\u201dJust as Zhang Xuan was busy touching the artifacts around the room, an authoritative voice resounded within the room.Turning his head to take a look, he saw the 'worldly expert' Master Mo Yang looking at him, nodding his head slightly as though to ascertain Zhang Xuan's doubts that he had been chosen. Countless gaze were affixed to him and they were filled with envy.\u201cMe?\u201d Zhang Xuan was taken aback.\u201cThis little friend here, there's no need for you to be so unconfident about yourself. You are the one!\u201d Master Mo Yang stroked his beard with a proud expression, as though saying that it was Zhang Xuan's honor to be chosen by him.\u201cUnconfident?\u201d Zhang Xuan shook his head.Which part of him looked unconfident? Rather, he was thinking about how he could be so unlucky to be chosen. [Of so many frenzied followers following behind you, why did you have to choose me?]However, after a short moment, he came to a realization. Those who were here for treasure speculation today were mostly following behind the back of the 'master'. Given that Zhang Xuan was the only one strolling about the hall, browsing through and touching the artifacts casually, it would be hard for him to not stand out!\u201cI appreciate your goodwill, but I don't need it!\u201dKnowing that the other party was a fraudster, he was unwilling to become the gold mine for him to profit from. Zhang Xuan waved his hand and continued to look through the pile of treasures.\u201cDon't need it?\u201d Master Mo Yang frowned.Of the nine slots he had given out previously, regardless of who they were, they all responded to him in enthusiasm, some even on the verge of fainting due to excessive agitation. Yet, when he chose this fellow, he actually\u2026 didn't want it?He concealed his darkened face quickly. Waving his hand, he walked forward while stroking his beard and looked at Zhang Xuan with a pained expression, \u201cSince you're here for treasure speculation, surely you would wish to buy a true treasure. I noticed that you have been browsing around the hall unskillfully, so I decided to offer you some guidance so that you won't end up bankrupt at such a young age. Are you certain that you don't need it? Don't disappoint me by rejecting the goodwill that I hold for you!\u201d\u201cLad, if you don't want the slot, give it to me!\u201d\u201cHe actually doesn't want the slot the master gave him, is there something wrong with his head?\u201d\u201cIt is clear to see that he is abnormal with a single look. I have noticed the fellow previously. He had been touching all of the artifacts in the room, it could be that he is thinking of stealing something!\u201d\u201cIf master were to grant such an opportunity to me, I would probably awake from my sleep smiling everyday!\u201d\u2026Everyone could hear the conversation between Zhang Xuan and the 'master' clearly, and they stared at the former as though they were looking at a monster.[He is a master appraiser!He will be leaving today after appraising for ten people! It is such a good opportunity and everyone is vying for it frenziedly. Yet, this fellow\u2026 doesn't want it?If his brain isn't damaged, what else can it be?]\u201cI really don't need it\u2026\u201d Zhang Xuan shook his head.[End up bankrupt? If I listen to your words, then I will truly end up bankrupt\u2026]\u201cDon't be so quick to reject me!\u201d Before Zhang Xuan could finish his words, 'Master Mo Yang' interrupted. With deep eyes that reflected his compassion for the world and his determination to save those in suffering, he said, \u201cIt isn't easy for a youngster like you to earn some money. I do not hope to earn anything from granting you this slot. It is out of the kindness of my heart that I hope that you do not buy something useless and waste your fortune!\u201d\u201cMaster Mo Yang is too compassionate!\u201d\u201cNot only is he capable of authenticating treasures, he is also kind! I am going to idolize him!\u201d\u201cFrom today onward, I will only respect one person and that is Master Mo Yang!\u201d\u2026Hearing his words, everyone felt a resurgence of respect for him.[Look at how compassionate he is?Despite possessing the ability to appraise treasures, he doesn't use it to earn great wealth. Instead, fearing that other people would suffer from making a wrong judgment, he is willing to expend the additional effort to appraise for him! One probably can't find another person as kind as him, even if one were to roam the world with a lantern!]\u201cI\u2026\u201dHe didn't expect him to be so shameless to declare these words in such a righteous tone. Zhang Xuan shook his head, but just as he was about to speak, the other party interrupted him once more.\u201cAlright, I know what you are thinking! Say no more!\u201d The elder looked at him calmly with pride reflecting in his eyes.\u201cYou know my thoughts?\u201d Zhang Xuan asked doubtfully.\u201cIndeed. You must be thinking that you are too young and do not possess sufficient strength. Even if you successfully obtain a treasure, you don't have the strength to guard it! Instead, you might even attract disaster to yourself!\u201d 'Master Mo Yang' said in a 'know-it-all' tone with his hands behind his back.\u201cSo that's the reason!\u201d\u201cNot only is the master incredible at appraising treasures, to think that he would have the capability of peering into the thoughts of others as well!\u201d\u201cIt is true that owning a treasure beyond one's ability can attract disaster. It is normal that this lad would have such thoughts!\u201d\u2026After hearing 'Master Mo Yang's' explanation, the crowd came to a realization. They finally understood why Zhang Xuan would reject such a wonderful opportunity.\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Zhang Xuan had no idea how he should respond.[This fellow is way too narcissistic.Don't have the strength to guard it\u2026 To think that you could think of such a thing.]\u201cEveryone!\u201d Just as Zhang Xuan was about to clarify the situation, the 'master' before him glanced at the surroundings and proudly declared, \u201cI have chosen this little fellow. So, regardless of what kind of treasures I have picked for him, I hope that you all wouldn't have any greedy thoughts towards it! Otherwise, you will be going against me. If so, don't blame me for being merciless!\u201d\u201cMaster, what are you talking about? How would we dare to lay our hands on a person you have chosen!\u201d\u201cMaster, rest assured. We would definitely not do such a stuff\u2026\u201dEveryone quickly replied in chorus.\u201cAlright, since I have already informed everyone else, feel free to buy it. You don't need to worry about attracting unwanted trouble!\u201d 'Master Mo Yang' looked at Zhang Xuan with an encouraging smile.\u201cI\u2026\u201dZhang Xuan didn't expect that this fellow would be so self-assuming. Just when he was about to speak, the other party interrupted him yet again. \u201cYou don't need to feel too touched by it. Since I have given the final slot to you, it means that our meeting is fated! It is hard to explain a thing such as fate through rational explanations, so you don't have to feel too thankful to me. I don't wish for anything in return for picking out a treasure for you, it is just purely kindness of my part!\u201d\u201cThat\u2026\u201d\u201cNo need for this and that. This treasure is it. I can guarantee you that once you buy it, you will definitely rake in great profits!\u201d'Master Mo Yang' didn't even give Zhang Xuan an opportunity to talk. He retrieved an item from the pile of artifacts and passed it over.\u201cEarn\u2026\u201dSeeing this treasure, Zhang Xuan was speechless.He had already analyzed it previously. It was a trash that could not be more useless. It wasn't even worth a single gold coin. Your loss would be equivalent to the price that you bought it at!\u201cBoss, can you collect the bill from this little friend here!\u201dPassing the treasure over, 'Master Mo Yang' gestured for the artifact dealer to come.\u201cA total of 30000 gold coins!\u201d The dealer walked over.\u201cHurry up and foot the bill, this is the most valuable treasure I have appraised tonight! Little friend, you have struck it rich!\u201d Seeing how Zhang Xuan remained motionless, the elder stroked his beard and a doting smile appeared on his face, \u201cAfter you return, clean up the outer layer. Try not to be too agitated by your newfound wealth!\u201d\u201cAgitated? Agitated your head!\u201d Upon having his words interrupted multiple times, Zhang Xuan could no longer rein his temper in. \u201cIf you want to scam others, go ahead, I won't interfere in your affairs! Why did you have to look for me? Is it that enjoyable to be trying to act cool? Didn't you notice how hard I have tried to spare your pride?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

'Master Mo Yang's' face darkens. \u201cLittle friend, do you have some kind of misunderstanding against me?\u201d\u201cMisunderstanding? You should be more than aware of what I am saying. If you want to scam someone, go ahead. It's none of my business, and I am not interested in interfering in your affairs as well! I choose my own artifacts while you scam your victims, let's stay out of each other's path. So, stop putting on that haughty look of yours in front of me!\u201dZhang Xuan waves him away, annoyed.He had never bore any goodwill towards scammers. Even so, as long as the other party doesn't get on his nerves, he is willing to let the issue slide. Yet, this fellow intends to make use of him to act cool, he is truly courting his death!\u201cWhat audacity!\u201d 'Master Mo Yang's' face pales and he flings his sleeves, his actions carrying an aura of righteousness with it. \u201cI have attained the qualifications of an appraiser 30 years ago, and I have helped numerous people out of difficulty. My conscience is clear! There has never been a single person who had accused me of scamming them. Everyone here can bear testimony to that, when had I ever scammed anyone of you?\u201d\u201cMaster Mo Yang is compassionate and saves those who are in precarious situations. How could he possibly be a fraudster!\u201d\u201cThat falsifying youngster over there, you must be tired of living!\u201d\u201cMaster, don't get angry. I will teach that fellow a lesson in your place so that he will learn to not to spout lies in the future\u2026\u201d\u2026With just a few words, 'Master Mo Yang' manages to stir up the rage of everyone here. Every single of them looks at Zhang Xuan as though he had murdered their family.\u201cAttained the qualifications of an appraiser 30 years ago? Conscience is clear?\u201dZhang Xuan is speechless.You are just a small apprentice appraiser, must you try so hard to act as though you are bigger than that?Your skin is much thicker than I thought.No wonder you are able to become scammer wanted by the Liuzhu Kingdom. Not only is your skin unbelievably thick, your ability to adapt to abrupt changes is truly frightening.Other scammers will panic when they are exposed before others. Yet, this fellow skillfully reverses the tip of the arrow back towards him, making it hard for him to step down from the current situation.If Zhang Xuan doesn't possess the Library of Heaven's Path, upon seeing how righteously the other party is acting, he would have surely suspected that he might be making a mistake. However, with the library in his hands, since it is stated on it that he is a scammer, then he is definitely one!\u201cEveryone, calm down!\u201d Seeing that everyone's anger is stirred and that he is on the offense now, 'Master Mo Yang' waves his hands and says, \u201cI am a forgiving person. If you can apologize for the words you said a moment ago, I can choose to not pursue the matter. Otherwise, you should be well-aware of the punishment awaiting you for intentionally slandering me!\u201d\u201cPunishment?\u201d Zhang Xuan shakes his head. \u201cIt isn't that hard to verify whether you are a scammer or not and whether I am lying or not. As long as they clean the outer coating off the artifacts they just bought, we will know the results instantly! What is the use of speaking so much nonsense here?\u201d\u201cClean it?\u201d 'Master Mo Yang' seems to have predicted that he would say such words. He replies calmly, \u201cI have already said previously that I will be leaving Tianxuan City by tonight. The artifacts that I have chosen for them are all large in size and will require at least half a day before their true form emerges. I still have urgent matters to attend to, and I cannot delay my departure for that long a time! Why, are you going to say that the reason why I am unwilling to stay here any longer is because I feel guilty so that you can make use of this to accuse me?\u201dAt this point, the elderly swings his arms and exudes a haughty disposition. \u201cI, Mo Yang, lived an upright life, so there's no reason for me to fear your accusations! However, I had helped you pick out an artifact out of goodwill on my part, only to have you accuse me of scamming you. Since you don't have concrete proof, it is an act of slander. Do you know the consequences of slandering a master appraiser?\u201dHearing these words, Zhang Xuan realizes that he is still underestimating the shamelessness of the other party.As expected of a professional scammer, to have already thought of a plan to back away if the situation were to turn awry.He had already clearly expressed that he will be leaving Tianxuan Kingdom tonight, thus paving an escape path beforehand. Before Zhang Xuan could even speak, he was already counterattacked. Right now, even if he were to say that he is afraid of waiting until the artifacts are cleaned thoroughly, no one will believe his words!Furthermore\u2026 Zhang Xuan really doesn't have any evidence to prove that he is a scammer!The secret on the Library of Heaven's Path cannot be revealed. Even if it is revealed, there must be at least someone here who is willing to believe him!\u201cLad, kneel down and apologize to the master now!\u201d\u201cTo dare to say that the master is a scammer, do you think that I dare not to kill you right now?\u201d\u201cWhere did this audacious beast come from, to dare to lay doubt upon the master's innocence?\u201d\u2026Upon seeing how righteous and indignant the 'master' is, many people choose to believe in him instantly, and the lot of them start to chastise Zhang Xuan.These people are completely furious.Those who were scammed had self-hypnotised themselves due to their reluctance to accept the claim that they have been scammed. No matter who it is, if someone dares to interrupt their beautiful dream, they will be refuted adamantly and rebuked.From their viewpoint, 'Master Mo Yang' is an upright person, so how can he possibly be a scammer?What kind of joke is this!\u201cSince this fellow dares to claim that the master is a scammer, he should be skilled in appraising, right? If you are that capable, why don't you choose one artifact out for us to see? If the one you chose turns out to be trash, you shall stop putting on an act here and scram!\u201dA voice from the crowd snorts.\u201cIndeed. Since you said that I am a scammer, and you are unwilling to accept the artifact I chose out for you, I'm sure you must be knowledgeable in appraising as well!\u201dAt this point, 'Master Mo Yang' nods his head and looks over, \u201cHow about this, I will give you a chance! We will each choose a simple and small artifact together so that we can clean it quickly for appraisal! As long as you are able to profit out of the object you chose, I will acknowledge that you are skilled and I will let the issue drop! But if you choose a useless trash, then I'm sorry, but you will have to buy the treasure I just picked out for you, kneel down and apologize to me!\u201d\u201cYou want to compete with me in a battle of appraisal?\u201d Just a moment ago, Zhang Xuan was still in a dilemma on coming up with evidence against him. However, hearing his words, he is slightly taken aback and he almost laughs on the spot.This fellow must have a screw loose!Zhang Xuan himself possesses the Library of Heaven's Path. If he were to claim that he is second in appraising, no one would dare to claim that they are first in the world\u2026 Are you sure that your head didn't get jammed between doors?However, after giving it some careful thought, he is also able to comprehend the rationale behind the other party's action.In the other party's perspective, Zhang Xuan is only an eighteen or nineteen year old youth, so what can he possibly know about appraising? Besides, since he was able to help others profit a few days ago, he must have prepared several means beforehand. If the both of them appraise concurrently and Zhang Xuan was to choose a useless artifact, he is able to make use of this opportunity to further build up his prestige. Perhaps, he might even be able to attract a few fools to invest frenziedly.\u201cWhy? You don't dare to accept the challenge?\u201d'Master Mo Yang' is resolute to eat Zhang Xuan whole.\u201cFine!\u201d Since the other party is seeking some thrill, how can Zhang Xuan bear to refuse him?\u201cAlright, then I'll go first!\u201d 'Master Mo Yang' flings his robe and walks along the long elevated platform with large strides. He quickly stops before a palm-size artifact and picks it up.This object is covered by a thick layer of rock, such that even the shape of the object inside cannot be ascertained, needless to say, to determine whether it is valuable or not.\u201cDealer, how much does this cost?\u201dPicking up the object, 'Master Mo Yang' enquires.\u201cThis object is small in size and there isn't much spirit energy movement that can be felt from it. 200 gold coins!\u201d The dealer replies and he walks over to Master Mo Yang.\u201cAlright, find someone to help me clean this up!\u201dPassing over the money, 'Master Mo Yang' says calmly.\u201cYes!\u201dThe dealer grabs hold of the treasure and sends it to the hall at the back. A moment later, he comes out with a golden toad in his hands. With an excited look, he says, \u201cCongratulations, master. It is the shed skin of \u3010Spirit Horned Golden Toad\u3011!\u201d\u201cWhat is a Spirit Horned Golden Toad?\u201d\u201cSpirit Horned Golden Toad is a tier-6 savage beast. Of its entire body, its most valuable part is its skin. It only molts once in its entire life. This object can be used in medicine and it is extremely valuable!\u201d\u201cAs expected of Master Mo Yang, to be able to pick out a treasure amidst everything else. Your ability of discernment is incredible!\u201d\u2026Upon hearing that it is the shed skin of the Spirit Horned Golden Toad, the hall bursts into commotion.\u201cMany people may not know of this item, so why don't you just state a price! It will be much more spectacular that way!\u201d With his head up high, 'Master Mo Yang' constantly exudes an acting cool aura as he speaks flatly.\u201cThis object is worth\u2026 2000 gold coins!\u201d The dealer exclaims.\u201c2000 gold coins?\u201d\u201cAfter buying it with 200 gold coins, the price grows to 2000 gold coin in an instant? A revenue of tenfold?\u201d\u201cThis is too incredible!\u201d\u201cAs expected of the master. If you can profit so much through a small object, then surely I will be able to make a killing over that giant artifact you chose for me previously!\u201d\u2026Upon seeing this sight, the eyes of the slightly worried crowd starts burning fanatically again.A master isn't just for show, a clear difference in standards shows the moment he makes a move!\u201cAlright, it's your turn!\u201d'Master Mo Yang' gestures with a cold gaze.\u201cI\u2026\u201d Zhang Xuan nods his head.Knowing that the other party is a scammer, he is aware that he would surely have a contingency plan. Even so, he didn't expect his contingency plan to be so incredible!He has to choose something at least of the same level as him.\u201cCan I choose the artifact first and decide on a price after the artifact has been cleaned?\u201dStepping forward, Zhang Xuan suddenly recalls something and looks at the dealer.\u201cNo way! You have to pay first before cleaning it! This is a part of the rules. Otherwise, what if it turns out to be a trash after you clean it and you no longer want it, or if it turns out too valuable and we no longer want to sell it? It would be impossible to resolve such situations!\u201dThe dealer states coldly.In order to prevent such contention, one has to pay upon after deciding on an artifact in treasure speculation. This is equivalent to signing a contract, no one will be able to turn their back on it.\u201cAlright then\u2026\u201dAfter being informed of the rules, Zhang Xuan can only nod his head. Then, turning over to look at the artifacts, he says without blushing, \u201cCome, point out for me which artifacts are worth less than eight gold coins in this pile! I will choose one from them\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Eight gold coins and below?\u201dSound of water spittingHearing Zhang Xuan's proud voice, everyone spits a mouthful of saliva. All of them stare at him flabbergasted, with an expression similar to how one looks at a lunatic.Are you for real?In treasure speculation, one is gambling for the thrill and the fortune. No matter what artifact one chooses, it is worth a minimum of hundred gold coins. Eight gold coins\u2026 What the heck do you expect to buy with that!\u201cIs this fellow's brain still functioning?\u201d\u201cEight gold coins? Wahaha, you might as well grab a pile of mud and return now.\u201cYou still dare to say eight gold coins and below. There isn't a single object that is that cheap here, okay\u2026\u201d\u2026A split moment later, tears stream down the faces of those amidst the crowd due to excessive laughter.The hell, lad, can you stop being so hilarious?How do you intend to find an object worth below eight gold coins here? You can't even buy anything even if you had eighty gold coins!\u201cWhy? You don't even have an artifact that is worth eight gold coin in a treasure speculation hall? Aren't you embarrassed?\u201dDisregarding the mockery the crowd is making out of him, Zhang Xuan stares at the dealer proudly.His previous self had only left him with a total of eight gold coins. He is unable to fork out a single coin more even if he wanted to.\u201cPuu!\u201dThe people in the crowd stare at one another and burst into laughter once again.You are the one who should be embarrassed!This is just like someone running to a realtor and hoping to buy a flat with a single gold coin!Big brother, is your head really alright?\u201cThere is no way there is an artifact here that is worth only eight gold coins. How about this, you can freely choose from this pile of items. After you're done, I will pay for you. If you make an earning, it will all go to you. If you lose, we will just go by what we promised earlier, an apology will do!\u201d'Master Mo Yang' stares at the young man contemptuously with both of his hands placed behind him, revealing an attitude of superiority.\u201cAs expected of Master Mo Yang, what incredible generosity!\u201d\u201cThis young man is a clown, coming here just to make a fool of himself!\u201d\u201cI concede to the master's morals!\u201d\u2026Hearing that the 'master' is willing to pay in the stead of his adversary, the crowd can't help but feel impressed by his generosity.Do you see that? Look at how the master carries himself, then look at that lad\u2026Forget it, it is better not to compare the two of them. I am afraid that I might vomit\u2026\u201cAre you sure?\u201d Zhang Xuan's eyes twinkle.Knowing that the other party is a scammer, Zhang Xuan doesn't feel any guilt spending his money.\u201cOf course, I always mean what I say!\u201d 'Master Mo Yang' seems just like a saint who has descended to the mortal world, unsullied by worldly dirt.\u201cHehe, I shall start picking then\u2026\u201dZhang Xuan smiles faintly, walks over to the platform and scans through the artifacts in the pile.Since the other party chose a small one, naturally, he is restricted to choosing smaller items as well. Besides, the larger the artifact, the longer it takes to clean it up.\u201cThis lad is too shameless!\u201d\u201cIndeed! I have no idea why would Master Mo Yang treat him so well. If I were to meet such a fellow, I would have surely smacked him away with a palm of mine long ago!\u201d\u201cTo insult the master and even use his money to buy an artifact\u2026 Shameless!\u201d\u2026Seeing how the young man isn't ashamed at all, rather, he is browsing through the items excitedly, the crowd is speechless.They have met thick-skinned people before, but they had never met one whose skin is that thick.You were the one who insulted the master as a scammer first! No matter what, the both of you should be in a hostile relationship. Under such circumstances, don't you feel embarrassed using the other party's money to buy an artifact to compete with him\u2026 That's enough of you!Ignoring the discussions of the crowd, Zhang Xuan touches every treasure that enters his vision. Soon, he also chooses a treasure of the size of a palm and hands it over.\u201cIt costs 200 gold coins as well!\u201d The dealer takes a look at it and says flatly.\u201cMaster, hurry up and foot the bill!\u201d Unashamed, Zhang Xuan gestures the 'master' to hurry up.\u201c\u2026\u201d A dark line streaks across 'Master Mo Yang's' face.He intended to ridicule the other party, but he didn't expect that he would accept his help so proudly, to the point that he seems like his servant instead now.Suppressing the urge to strangle the other party, he pays the sum.\u201cAlright, let's clean it up here. With everyone watching here, no one will be able to accuse me of falsifying the results!\u201d Zhang Xuan gestures.\u201cHmph, let's see whether you can continue being so haughty after the object is cleaned up!\u201dThe actions of the young man also infuriate the dealer. He casually fetches the tools used for cleaning artifacts and starts to clean it bit by bit.Soon, the moss and rock covering the object fall off and the true form of the item inside is revealed.It is a semi-transparent rock that emits a warm glow.\u201cThis is\u2026 Linglong Stone?\u201d Observing the appearance of the stone, someone from the crowd shouts in disbelief.\u201cWhat is Linglong Stone?\u201d Some in the crowd recognizes it while others don't.\u201cYou don't even know this? Linglong Stone is one of the main ingredients to crafting a phantom-tier equipment. Every single stone is extremely valuable, and it is the type of good which is always short in supply!\u201d The person who spoke earlier explains in agitation.Equipment can be split into god, saint, spirit, phantom and mortal!In a location like Tianxuan Kingdom, there is almost no mortal pinnacle equipment, needless to say, phantom-tier equipment. Thus, every single one of it can be sold at an exorbitant price.As the main ingredient to crafting phantom-tier equipment, the moment it is put up for auction, countless families and experts will go frenzied over it.\u201cHow much can it be sold for?\u201dThose who don't recognize this item can't help but ask.It is difficult to perceive an item's value just by its rarity itself. The best way to ascertain its value is still through its price.\u201cI've heard that the Liuzhu Kingdom had auctioned one of it a few years ago. It was smaller than this, around the size of a chicken's egg, but it was already priced at 50000 gold coins! Look at how big this one is, not to mention its level of purity. No matter what, it is worth at least 100000\u2026\u201dThe one speaking swallows his saliva at this point.\u201c100000\u2026\u201dEveryone on the spot almost goes mad.An object bought for 200 gold coin is sold for 100000?A revenue of 500 times in an instant\u2026Is this for real?\u201cThis\u2026 This\u2026\u201d The dealer's hands tremble as he stares in disbelief at the object in his hands.As a dealer of a treasure speculation hall, he is capable of identifying plenty of treasures and is aware of their prices. He knows that there isn't a single error in the words of the person who just spoke!This item is definitely worth that price!\u201cImpossible\u2026 I must be seeing things\u2026\u201dSeeing the shock washing through the crowd, Master Mo Yang's face twitches.He thought that the other party would be unable to choose anything of value and that he would be able to make use of it to display his superiority once more. Never in his dreams did he expect for such an incredible treasure to be chosen.Both the items are priced at 200 gold coins, yet his was only sold for 2000 whereas the other party's one is valued at 100000\u2026Isn't the difference too massive!\u201cI will be auctioning this Linglong Stone now, the highest bidder wins!\u201dAware of what this object is beforehand, Zhang Xuan isn't surprised in the least. He grabs the treasure from the hands of the dealer and gazes at the crowd.\u201cI offer 100000!\u201dThe one who recognized the Linglong Stone earlier shouts his bid first.100000 gold coin may be a huge sum, but compared to a treasure like Linglong Stone, the latter is much more valuable.\u201cI offer 110000!\u201dThere are a few within the crowd that are aware of its value as well.\u201c120000\u2026\u201d\u2026Soon, the price is finalized at 153000, and the stone is taken by a wealthy middle-aged man.\u201cThis is a banknote from \u3010Tianxuan Bank\u3011. With this, you are able to withdraw 153000 gold coins from any single bank in Tianxuan City!\u201d The middle-aged man grabs the Linglong stone and passes over a stack of banknotes.The weight of gold coins is considerable, so moving them around isn't very convenient. Thus, just like in the ancient times of Earth, banknotes and similar paper notes started appearing.\u201cUn!\u201dAfter taking a look, he knows that those notes are real and places it into his embrace. Then, he retrieves a banknote worth a thousand and walks over to 'Master Mo Yang'. \u201cYou paid 200 gold coins for me earlier. Here is a thousand, keep the change. Treat it as a tip!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Like I will take your tip...With a hardened face, 'Master Mo Yang' is on the verge of exploding. At this point, he will be placed in an awkward situation regardless of whether he takes it or not.If he takes it, it means he would be accepting the tip of other's tip. In that case, he would be no different from a waiter or a servant. If he refuses... Just the action of the other party alone causes him to feel embarrassed!Suddenly, a thought floats into his mind... Could the lad have foreseen this in advance, that's why he took his money so as to intentionally cause him embarrassment?\"You don't want it? Great, I can save a thousand then. You must know that one can buy a lot of things with a thousand gold coins!\"Sensing his hesitation, Zhang Xuan places the note back into his embrace and mutters by the side.\"...\" Hearing these words, 'Master Mo Yang' is on the verge of collapsing.\"You sure are lucky, choosing the right one. However, this doesn't mean that you have won! Alright, I still have things to attend to, so it is about time for me to leave!\"With coldness in his gaze, 'Master Mo Yang' stands up, flings his arm and prepares to leave.His decisive action impresses Zhang Xuan.As expected of a professional scammer. The moment things go awry, he leaves. His decisiveness is truly worthy of respect.Regardless of whether Zhang Xuan is lucky or he is truly skilled in appraising, he would no longer be treated as a lunatic after earning so much in an instant. Rather than grinding it out with him, it is much wiser for him to end it here.After all, he has already profited greatly from appraising for the others.The longer the argument carries on for, the higher the possibility of something going wrong for him.\"The results of our competition isn't conclusive yet, why are you in such a hurry to leave!\" Given 'Master Mo Yang's' previous actions, there is no way Zhang Xuan can allow him to escape just like this.\"Indeed, master, don't be in such a hurry to leave! You also made a profit from the item you bought, this can't be considered as his victory!\"\"Master has only underestimated his enemy, that's why he didn't choose the most valuable treasure from the start. We believe in you...\"After numerous days of effort, the master has roped in a large group of loyal followers.\"I have already said before that I have matters to attend to. Farewell!\" 'Master Mo Yang' waves his hand.\"Even if you have urgent matters to attend to, I doubt that a few minutes will matter much. There are still things that I would like your guidance on!\" Zhang Xuan blocks the other party's escape path.\"What kind of things?\" 'Master Mo Yang' stops and harrumphs coldly.\"This friend...\"Seeing him cease his movements, Zhang Xuan smiles faintly and stares at the elderly who had obtained the slot for appraisal and bought the ornamental vase.\"What is it? The elderly walks over.He is still hugging the artifact containing the ornamental vase as though he is hugging a precious treasure. Given its size, he will be unable to clean it up within a short period of time. Thus, he chose to stay to join in the spectacle.\"If I'm not wrong, the item you spent 80000 gold coins to purchase is an ornamental vase. Furthermore, it is a broken one and it is not even worth a single gold coin!\" Zhang Xuan points to his artifact and states.\"Ornamental vase? Not even worth a single cent? What kind of joke is this? This is something the master chose for me...\" The face of the elderly darkens as he chastises Zhang Xuan.\"Cleaning up such a large artifact will take a long time. At the minimum, you will require at least a day. How about this, you smash it on the floor directly and if I'm wrong, I will pay you 80000 gold coins! However, if I'm right, it means that you have fallen into his trap and got scammed. If so, you can just demand the money back from the one who scammed your money!\"Zhang Xuan offers with a grin.\"Smash it?\" The elderly is taken aback by his words.The words of the other party make sense. Cleaning up such a large artifact will surely take a lot of time. However, if he were to smash it on the floor, it would only take an instant.If it was truly as the other party claims and it turns out to be just an ornamental vase, then he would have made a big loss.Even for him, a loss of 80000 gold coins is enough to send him into bankruptcy.If the artifact turns out to be a fake, he will probably commit suicide.If the young man were to say these words a moment ago, he would simply scoff and disregard his words. However, the other party has just bought a treasure which won him a revenue of 765 times. This very fact makes his determination wavers.\"Worry not, a true treasure won't shatter that easily. Even if you were to smash it, it is very unlikely for it to break. You won't make a loss!\" Sensing his hesitation, Zhang Xuan pushes on.\"Alright!\"After a short moment of contemplation, the elderly casually smashes the artifact in his embrace on the floor.Dang lang!With a crisp sound, the giant artifact shatters apart, and its true form reveals itself amidst the moss and mud... Indeed, it turns out to be a shattered vase.\"It is really... an ornamental vase?\"After taking a look, the crowd verifies that it is indubitably an ornamental vase.Even if this object is an antique left behind from the ancient times, it still isn't worth much money. Needless to say 80000 gold coin, no one would buy it for even 10 gold coins.\"What is going on here...\"Seeing the broken fragments on the floor, the elderly freezes in shock.Initially, he had placed all of his hope on this artifact to earn him big bucks, yet it all ended up like this. How can he possibly not go berserk?\"What is happening? You will have to ask this Master Mo Yang! If I'm not wrong, he worked together with the dealer to build his fame as an appraiser so as to attract everyone's attention. Then, through his appraisals, he is able to get you all to spend big bucks to buy the artifacts he decides upon, thus profiting from it!\"Zhang Xuan looks at 'Master Mo Yang' and the dealer, and the corners of his mouth creep upwards. \"As for why he was able to choose objects of high value, the reason is simple. Since the cleaning process did not happen before you, they are able to switch the item inside with another treasure they prepared beforehand and claim that it is the one he had just picked out. Anyway, no one saw the cleaning process, so no one is able to refute his claims.\"\"This...\"\"Is that true?\"...Hearing Zhang Xuan's words, everyone's trust in 'Master Mo Yang' wavers.After picking out a treasure before everyone else, Zhang Xuan successfully exposes a fake treasure that 'Master Mo Yang' appraised. The crowd who had complete trust in 'Master Mo Yang' a moment ago is starting to get suspicious.Dang lang!While they are still busy contemplating over who is right and who is wrong, another crisp sound echoes amidst the crowd. Another fellow who had received the appraisal slot smashed the artifact he bought as well. This time, it isn't an ornamental vase but a useless pottery. It is clear with a single look that it isn't worth much.\"Fake, it is a fake! I spent 60000 gold coins to buy this... They are scammers!\"Seeing the broken shards on the floor, those who bought the appraised items know that they have been scammed as well and started roaring frenziedly.Peng! Hong! Puhe!With the two precedents, the remaining few can no longer hold it in. One after another, towards the artifacts they just bought, they throw, smash with a hammer or cut it open with a blade.Taking a look at what is inside, all of their faces pale.\"They are all fakes... They are all worthless trash!\"\"We have been duped. This Master Mo Yang is a fraud...\"If there was only one fake, the crowd would still be able to accept it. After all, even an appraiser can't possibly pick treasures out of artifacts hundred percent of the time. However, when all nine of the artifacts that he had appraised turn out to be trash, it can only mean to say that he is a scammer!To think that you still acted so compassionate and benevolent... Pui! You are just a fraudster!The berserk crowd surrounds 'Master Mo Yang' and the dealer tightly as they stare at them intensely. At this moment, even the thought of killing them flashes through their minds.After all, no one's money came from the sky.If no one saw through the sham, and they only realized that it is a scam after they are done cleaning, who can they find to redress their grievances?\"Don't listen to the nonsense of this lad! Even master appraisers have moments when they are off, I am truly unacquainted with this artifact dealer...\"Seeing the murderous glare in the eyes of the crowd, 'Master Mo Yang' realizes that it is no longer possible to fool them and roars in anger instead.If it was a moment ago, the crowd would have definitely listened to his words. But now... No one pays him any heed anymore.Peng peng peng peng!The sound of someone hitting on a human sandbag echoes from the congregation of the crowd. Following which, cries of agony can be heard. In this ordeal, not even the artifact dealer is spared.As for the initiator of the incident, Zhang Xuan, he had sneaked off the moment chaos broke out inside.The world is humongous, and every day, there are people who are going about scamming others, and there are people who are scammed by them. He isn't an omnipotent god, and it is impossible for him to interfere in all of them. If it wasn't for 'Master Mo Yang's' excessive mouth, he couldn't be bothered to exposing him.Now that those who were scammed are aware of the situation, naturally, they have their own way of dealing with the problem. There is no need for Zhang Xuan to worry about them.\"Huang Yu Bookstore...\"Walking slowly along the market, a giant store appears before him. In it, there are all kinds of books filling the bookshelves within.The store deals with medicinal herbs, weapons, savage beasts and naturally, books. That is also his main motive for choosing to enter this store.\"Let me take a look!\"Zhang Xuan lifts his leg and steps into the store.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Huang YuTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"Gongzi, are you here to buy books or to browse through books?\"Gongzi -> GentlemanThe moment he steps into the bookstore, a young lady steps forward to welcome him.Around seventeen to eighteen year old, her pure face and appearance are particularly alluring. Even though she is still slightly lacking compared to Shen Bi Ru laoshi, she is considered as an exceptional beauty.\"Is there... secret manuals on Fighter 6-dan cultivation technique here?\"Zhang Xuan reveals his objective here to her.\"Fighter 6-dan cultivation technique? Gongzi must be joking. Such secret manuals on cultivation technique cost a hefty sum, a little business like ours doesn't have the qualifications to be selling them... If you want some entrance level cultivation technique manuals, we have a few of it here though...\" The lady shakes her head.The books sold in their store mainly consists of human geography, biographies of reputable figures and such. Cultivation techniques are something highly confidential to cultivators, so how can it be allowed to be browsed through or sold freely?\"Then... Do you know any stores that sell them?\" Confirming his suspects that the manuals aren't on sale here, Zhang Xuan sighs and looks at her in expectation.\"Sell them?\" The lady shakes her head. \"It is impossible for anyone in Tianxuan Royal City to be selling cultivation techniques of this level. However... Some experts do collect quite a few of them. If you have an amicable relationship with them, it might be possible for them to allow you to look through them!\"\"Allow me to look through them? Taking a look is great as well!\" Zhang Xuan's eyes light up.With the Library of Heaven's Path, there is no need for him to buy the books. As long as he is able to lay his hand on those books, just by flipping through it, a corresponding book will be compiled automatically.\"Do you know any seniors who collect such manuals in their residence, and allow others to browse through them?\" He can't resist asking.\"Allow others to browse through them?\" The lady frowns and just as she is about to shake her head, she suddenly thought of something and slyness flits across her eyes. She smiles and says, \"I do know of one. However, he is known for being eccentric! When he is in high spirits, he won't mind even if you were to take all of the books in his house. But if he is in a bad mood, ignoring the fact whether he will allow you to browse through his books or not, he might not even allow you to walk through his door...\"\"Such a person exists in the world?\" Zhang Xuan frowns. He continues, \"Then, may I trouble you to guide me to seek that senior?\"\"It just happens that there isn't much business today. I will bring you there now!\" The young lady smiles.\"Thanks for the trouble!\"He doesn't expect the lady to be so helpful as to bring him there personally, so he nods his head in gratitude.With the lady leading ahead, the two of them walk out of the bookstore.Through their idle chatter, Zhang Xuan learns that the name of the lady is Huang Yu. This bookstore is opened by her. Judging from the appearance of the bookstore, it seems to be newly opened, at maximum around ten days or so.\"You are saying that there are many books in the home of that senior?\" After walking a distance, Zhang Xuan can't resist asking.\"Naturally. That senior is a famous scholar in the entire kingdom, and he was once Emperor Shen Zhui's tutor! He is a person who is able to freely go in and out of the kingdom's Book Collection Vault. Do you think that it is possible for the books in his home to not be many?\" Huang Yu says reverently.\"Emperor Shen Zhui's teacher? That means, he used to be an emperor's tutor?\" Zhang Xuan is stunned.The current emperor of Tianxuan Kingdom is named Shen Zhui. No one is aware of the specific level of his cultivation, they only know that he is the strongest person in the entire kingdom, unmatched by anyone!The tutors of such a figure are carefully handpicked and have to undergo numerous selection processes before their positions are confirmed. Even the principal of Hongtian Academy doesn't possess such qualifications!\"He is his painting and calligraphy teacher, and not his martial arts teacher. Even so, he is still an incredible figure who is deeply respected by the emperor!\" At this point, Huang Yu's face turns solemn as she warns Zhang Xuan, \"This old mister Lu Chen is an elegant person who is very particular about decorum. He detests juniors talking nonsense before him. When we arrive, it is best for you to not to speak too easily. Otherwise, it will be impossible for you to be given permission to browse through his books!\"\"Un!\" Zhang Xuan nods his head.\"Also, I also have my own matters to attend to. When we arrive, you will have to deal with the matter of borrowing books yourself, don't mess up my matter along with yours!\" Huang Yu glances over with her beautiful eyes as she speaks.\"Don't worry, I won't put you in a difficult position!\" Comprehending the meaning behind her words, Zhang Xuan smiles in response.He is already grateful for the fact that she is willing to bring him over. If he is capable, he will be able to borrow the books. However, even if he ends up in failure, nothing can be done about it.No matter what, he is still a teacher. How can he put a young lady in an awkward position?\"The old mister prefers juniors who are more obedient. No matter what the old mister says, you just have to nod your head. You should also know that a great scholar like him tend to be more conservative so his thoughts may diverge from that of us, youngsters. Just try not to squabble with him over these!\" Huang Yu reminds him once again.The two of them soon walks out of the market. After passing by a series of alleys that would leave one confused, they arrive at a residence.\"This is the residence of old mister Lu Chen!\" Huang Yu points towards the residence.Zhang Xuan raises his head to take a look at the entire residence. It isn't as vast and extravagant as he expected. It seems like the residence of an ordinary household and there isn't even a door plaque at the entrance. If it weren't for Huang Yu leading him here, he might have thought that this is the residence of a normal civilian.This is... the place where the emperor's tutor lives?Zhang Xuan finds it hard to believe.\"Old mister Lu Chen lives a thrifty life. There were many times when Emperor Shen Zhui offered to reconstruct his residence, but he firmly rejected the offers!\" Noticing his doubt, Huang Yu explains.Zhang Xuan nods his head as his respect for the emperor's tutor grows.Despite possessing such social status, he is able to remain incorruptible and thrifty without being changed by power. It seems like this old mister is a sentimental and straightforward person.Da da da da!Just as they are about to knock on the door, a carriage rushes over. The distinct sound of the galloping of the horse echoes through the alley.Jiyaaaa!The carriage stops beside the two. A young man parts the curtains of the carriage and walks out.He is a seventeen to eighteen year old youth dressed in white. Tall and slim, his face is exquisite, similar to a white jade. With a single look, it is clear to see that he is scion, and he exudes an aura of superiority.\"Xiao Yu? You are here too!\"Xiao Yu -> Little Yu (A pet name for Huang Yu)Seeing Huang Yu, the white-clothed gongzi's eyes twinkle and immediately tries to fawn upon her.Gongzi -> Gentleman\"I am Huang Yu, don't give me such a mushy nickname. We aren't that familiar with one another yet!\" Huang Yu curls her lips contemptuously.\"Given the relationship between our families, it isn't too much to call you Xiao Yu. Besides, wasn't that how I called you when you were younger as well? Are you here to visit old mister Lu Chen as well?\" The white-clothed gongzi smiles and flings his robe. He strikes a pose, as though declaring that victory is in his hands. \"Hehe, don't think too much about that object. It will definitely come under my possession!\"\"It is hard to tell whose it will be at this point! I only fear that you will cry then!\" Huang Yu doesn't step down to his taunting.\"We'll see then!\"The white-clothed gongzi chuckles. At this point, he finally notices Zhang Xuan and frowns, \"Who is this? Xiao Yu, why did you bring an outsider here...\"\"No matter who is it that I bring, it is none of your business!\"Huang Yu purses her lips, not sparing the other party any face.\"Hmph, lad. No matter who you are, I advise you to stay away from Xiao Yu. She isn't someone a small figure like you can lay your hands upon!\" Looking at Zhang Xuan, the white-clothed gongzi narrows his eyes and spits coldly.\"...\"Zhang Xuan didn't expect to be threatened when he is here only to borrow a book. A strong feeling of helplessness surges through him.Using the words from his previous world, he is lucky like a dead mongoose.All Huang Yu did is to bring him here, they are just barely acquaintances. Do you really have to go that far?Threatened by someone, Zhang Xuan feels displeased. He stretches his back and waves away his concerns, \"You interfere too much. My apologies but I don't think that you need to concern yourself over this!\"\"Fine, I hope that you don't regret your words!\"He didn't expect that a lad he had never met before would dare to speak to him in such a manner. The white-clothed gongzi's eyebrows shoot up and his eyes narrow. Turning around, he ignores the other two and walks over to the front of the courtyard to knock on the door.\"Why are you so rash...\"As the white-clothed man knocks on the door, Huang Yu's anxious voice sounds by Zhang Xuan's ears.\"Why?\" Zhang Xuan looks at her in puzzlement.\"Do you know who he is, for you to dare to speak to him like that?\" Seeing the oblivious look on the other party's face, Huang Yu feels a little helpless.It is truly hard to tell whether this fellow has a strong heart or that there is something wrong with his head.\"Who cares who he is...\" Zhang Xuan shrugs.What does his identity have to do with me?\"You...\" Seeing the expression on the young man's face, Huang Yu is starting to doubt if she had brought a fool over. Seeing the indifferent look in his eyes, she is able to tell that he truly isn't bothered over the identity of the person he just offended. At a loss for words, she could only introduce the person before to him, \"He is the sole son of Zhennan Wang, Bai Xun!\"Zhennan Wang is known as the number one authoritative subject of Tianxuan Kingdom, his position beneath only that of Emperor Shen Zhui. Offending his only son means that it will be hard for him to make a living in Tianxuan Kingdom.Initially, she thought that revealing the identity of the other party will induce fear in this fellow and that he would ask her how he should resolve the problem. Contrary to her expectations, Zhang Xuan looks over with a confused expression, \"Zhennan Wang... Who is he?\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: What the Heck is This ToyTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"...\" Huang Yu feels the vision before her spin and she almost faints on the spot.To not even know Zhennan Wang? Dude, are you really from Tianxuan Kingdom? Are you sure you didn't pop up from some remote corner!At this moment, she is starting to regret bringing this fellow here!Given how ignorant he is, it is likely he will say something wrong and pull her down along with him!Actually, Zhang Xuan really isn't putting on an act, he is truly ignorant on this matter.His previous self is the worst teacher in the academy. All along, he has been occupied with how he could stop himself from being expelled from the school. Thus, he never tried to look into the internal affairs of the kingdom and knows very little about it as well. The previous him doesn't even know what section, division and bureau are, so how could he possibly know who Zhennan Wang is.Jiya!Just as she is about to explain the glorious war accomplishments of Zhennan Wang, the door in front of them creaks and opens. A butler-like person appears in their view, welcoming them.\"Uncle Cheng, I am prepared now. I hope to receive master's guidance again!\" Towards the butler he calls Uncle Cheng, the white-clothed gongzi Bai Xun speaks respectfully, the arrogance he had a moment ago absent in his voice.Gongzi -> Gentleman\"So it is Bai gongzi and Huang guniang! Please follow me to wait at the lounge!\" Upon catching sight of the three standing at the entrance of the door, the butler bows and ushers them in.Gongzi -> GentlemanGuniang -> Lady/MissThe three of them follow behind him into the residence.Zhang Xuan gazes around the surroundings.The residence may not be extravagant in its renovations, inferior even when compared to certain parts of the academy, but it brings about a wholly different atmosphere. Every moment of stillness and every movement in the courtyard feels like a tranquil ink painting which exudes indescribable elegance.\"What an incredible natural ink painting!\"Zhang Xuan can't help praising.\"Oh? Gongzi... seems to have some aptitude towards painting?\" Hearing his praise, the butler turns around and asks.\"It is just a casual comment!\" He didn't expect that a casual comment that he spoke would attract the attention of the butler. Zhang Xuan hurriedly shakes his head.In his previous life, he was a librarian, and his job is deeply related to literacy. Even though he had seen many different paintings back then, he had never picked up a brush, needless to say, paint!\"Our laoye used his heart as his brush and the courtyard as his paper to turn the entire residence into a painting. You aren't mistaken in your words!\" The butler nods his head and continues moving forward.Laoye -> Old masterSoon, they arrive at the lounge.The lounge isn't very big but is rich in paintings, giving the room a kind of classical elegance. It has a soothing effect on those who step into it.It is unlike the other places, where Strength Measuring Rock Pillars can be found everywhere, which makes one feel as though they would be thrown out if they display insufficient strength.\"I will be reporting to laoye!\"After arranging the seats for the three of them, the butler turns around to leave.\"You know a thing or two about paintings?\" The moment the butler leaves, Huang Yu looks over curiously.She seems to have heard the conversation back there. Come to think about it, she doesn't know a single thing about the young man she brought here.\"I only felt that the arrangement in the courtyard is reminiscent of a painting!\" Zhang Xuan replies.\"Xiao Yu, don't listen to his nonsense. This fellow is just putting on a show to attract your attention!\" Bai Xun's glare is so intense that fire may emerge from it.\"What do you know? My friend here is extremely knowledgeable and talented! Do you think that everyone likes to act mighty the way you do?\" Hearing the other party insult the friend she brought, Huang Yu is displeased.\"Knowledgeable? Him? Xiao Yu, you should be careful. I think this lad is just a useless playboy. Despite being young, he is skilled in the art of deceiving to win the favor of girls. He truly has no shame!\"Luoluo, hearing the lady praise Zhang Xuan, Bai Xun feels the rage in him boiling even more intensely and he grits his teeth furiously.\"My friend here is skilled in zither, chess, literature and painting, there is nothing he is incapable of, there is nothing he doesn't have expertise in. Not only is he outstanding in the younger generation, there aren't many of the older generation who can match up to him! On the contrary, look at yourself! You aren't skilled in anything, and your mind is only filled with fighting and killing all day long! You are the one that is useless!\"Huang Yu doesn't back down.\"Skilled in zither, chess, literature and painting? You mean him? He doesn't look much older than me. Even if he started learning in the womb, how much can he learn? You are probably the only one who will get scammed by him!\" Bai Xun glares savagely at Zhang Xuan.\"Just because he is young means that he isn't skilled? What if he is talented? Don't doubt others just because you are untalented!\" Huang Yu retorts.\"...\" Hearing their argument, the innocent Zhang Xuan who had arrows fired at him frowns.If you want to argue, just argue among yourselves! Why must you all rope me in? Did I offend any of you?Zither, chess, literature and painting, you said? I have never touched any of the four in my entire life... If I am talented, how can I possibly be the first teacher in history to score a zero in the Teacher Qualification Examination in Hongtian Academy?Just as Bai Xun is about to counterattack with words of his own, footsteps sound from the outside and a figure walks in.It is an elderly man with snow-white hair and beard. He carries with him a unique aura which grants him a majestic disposition.The butler from before follows behind him.Emperor Shen Zhui's ex-tutor, Lu Chen!\"Paying respect to master!\"Upon seeing him, Bai Xun and Huang Yu dare not bicker any longer and bow simultaneously.\"I heard that someone was able to tell that the arrangement of my courtyard is an ink painting. It is rare to see such a refined youngster nowadays.\"Ignoring the two who are paying respect to him, the moment the elderly man walks in, his eyes is fixated upon Zhang Xuan. It is apparent that the butler has informed him of Zhang Xuan's previous words.\"Master, this fellow is just spouting nonsense, there's no need to bother about him. I have already revised beforehand, so master, you can feel free to test me...\" Upon seeing the master's attention fixated on the lad, Bai Xun feels displeased and hurriedly says.\"Did I allow you to talk?\"Master Lu Chen frowns.\"I...\"Bai Xun's face turns completely red, but he dares not talk back to him.He might be of high standing, and his father is formidable as well. However, before the emperor's tutor, he still pales far in comparison.After reprimanding Bai Xun, Master Lu Chen's attention returns back to Zhang Xuan. \"Since you are learned in painting, it just happens that I have a work here for you to appraise in my stead!\"After which, he gestures with his hand.The butler hurries forward and unfurls a painting scroll on the table.It is a simple and elegant ink painting. The moment it is unfurled, a refreshing aura assaults its viewers. In a peaceful village, children are frolicking around and smoke emerges from the chimneys. If one concentrates, it seems as though one can hear the call of the cicada and see the dance of the tree leaves. It is a painting of a scenery.\"This...\" Zhang Xuan scratches his head.He doesn't know a single thing about painting. All he can tell about this painting is that it isn't bad. Asking him to appraise? What is he supposed to appraise about it?\"You must think carefully before you speak. This is a test by the master, he... likes to test others. Anyway, when I first came, I was tested by him too... If you manage to speak well, you will be able to borrow as many books as you like. But if you were to screw this up, you will be sent back instantly...\"Just as he is hesitating, Huang Yu's agitated voice sounds beside him.\"Test?\"Zhang Xuan smiles bitterly.If only he knew that Master Lu Chen has such interests, he wouldn't have said anything when he walked into the courtyard.Is this considered as courting trouble? However, based on Huang Yu's words, it is likely that the other party will test him even if he says nothing. After all, this is a habit he has cultivated. He probably can't shake it off even if he wanted to.As for appraising it, what the heck is he supposed to appraise!He isn't even learned in that aspect, what problems can he see from it? What kind of comments should he be making?After all, the other party is the emperor's tutor, a master of painting. If he were to spout nonsense, he might be chased away with a stick even before he is done speaking.\"Why? Is there any problem?\"Upon seeing his expression, Master Lu Chen enquires.\"Ah, nothing!\"Zhang Xuan scratches his head. Just as he is at a loss on how he should organize his sentences to come up with words that the other party is unable to find flaws with, a thought suddenly flashes through his mind.\"Since the Library of Heaven's Path is capable of authenticating items, then... is it possible for it to tell the flaws in paintings?\"At this point, he can't resist stepping forward to touch the painting lightly.Weng!A sound echo in his head and a book appears in his mind.Zhang Xuan is overjoyed. After reading the contents of it, he raises his head and gazes at Master Lu Chen with bright eyes. Smiling faintly, he asks, \"Master really wants me to appraise this?\"Master Lu Chen doesn't respond, indicating his silent consent.\"I have eight words of evaluation on it!\" Zhang Xuan says.\"I am willing to listen to it!\" Master Lu Chen looks at Zhang Xuan.Zhang Xuan nods his head. His eyes scan through the painting once more and he shakes his head, \"The eight words are... Downright senseless, what the heck is this toy!\"\"Gongzi, please mind your words!\" Initially, he was curious on the evaluation Zhang Xuan could give. Upon hearing these words, the butler almost faints on the spot. Flustered, he tries to stop him hurriedly, \"This is a painting that was just drawn by the master...\"Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: How Did He Do ItTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\"A painting left behind by the master?\"By the side, Huang Yu feels like she is going insane. She almost loses her balance and falls to the floor.In the past, Master Lu Chen had brought out paintings for them to appraise, as well as to test them. However... he had never brought out his own works!This time, why would he...If the fellow before her had praised the work the master took out, perhaps, the master will be delighted with his evaluation and let it pass. However... what did you say -- Downright senseless, what the heck is this toy?Is this something a human should say?To evaluate Master Lu Chen's drawing as downright senseless, what the heck is this toy...Huang Yu feels like vomiting blood.Didn't you say that you won't put me in a difficult position? This... What is going on?If she knew that Zhang Xuan had decided afterward that as a teacher, he shouldn't put her in an awkward situation... more blood will probably come spurting out from her mouth!Is this what you call not putting me in an awkward situation?You are obviously pushing me down the cliff...She is regretting her action of bringing this fellow here!Master Lu Chen favors youngsters who learn with humility. He never discriminates against people, and he likes people coming over to learn from him.This fellow seems scholarly on the surface, as well as a person who knows his boundaries, so she thought that he is the type to learn with humility. Thus, she brought him over so she could please the master. If things go well, she could make use of the opportunity to achieve her goals as well. Yet, she never would have expected that... he is so unreliable!Huang Yu feels her guts turn green with regret.If only she knew that this would happen, she would have rejected him on the spot. Why did she guide him over just to bring trouble on herself...While she is on the verge of going berserk, Bai Xun is on the verge of laughing.Indeed, what is scary is not a godlike opponent, but a pig-like teammate.This fellow actually dares to describe Master Lu Chen's work as 'what the heck is this toy'. Needless to think, he must have offended the master thoroughly with his words. Even if he doesn't make a move, the master will probably teach this ignorant lad a lesson!\"Is this the knowledge and talent you speak of? Skilled in zither, chess, literature and painting?\"Chuckling softly, he gazes at Huang Yu teasingly.Huang Yu had just praised Zhang Xuan a moment ago, yet in the next, the latter spoke such words. Have you ever seen a knowledgeable and talented person act like this?\"Silence!\"In contrast to butler Uncle Cheng's anxiety, Huang Yu's regret and Bai Xun's glee, Master Lu Chen doesn't get mad due to the other party's words. He interrupts the commotion going on and looks at Lu Chen calmly, \"This little brother over here, why would you make such an evaluation? Is there a problem with my drawing?\"\"I didn't know that it was master's work. I seek your forgiveness for my brashness!\" Zhang Xuan feigns shock and hurriedly bows apologetically.The book compiled by the Library of Heaven's Path allows him to look into the flaws of the painting, and the artist is also labeled in it. Naturally, he knows that the painting before him is Lu Chen's work, just that he is intentionally feigning ignorance!\"Don't worry about it. This is just a painting. I am only asking you to appraise the strengths and weaknesses of the painting, and not the painter of it!\" Master Lu Chen gestures.\"With your words, I am reassured!\" Zhang Xuan smiles. Facing the painting again, he strokes it and says, \"If we are just talking about this painting, even if it is drawn by the master... I can only use these eight words to evaluate it! Downright senseless, what the heck is this toy!\"Huang Yu and the butler look calm on the surface, but panic on the inside.To say such words after knowing that this is a work of the master. Lad, are you insane?\"However...\"Zhang Xuan pauses for a moment.\"However what?\"\"This painting is indeed nothing much. Any artist by the street would be able to draw it. It is already an overestimation by calling it a toy! However, if one is able to see beyond its surface, then it is definitely an astonishing creation that will leave its viewers in disbelief!\"Zhang Xuan says.\"Look beyond the surface? How should we look?\" Master Lu Chen smiles gently.\"Simple!\" Zhang Xuan looks at the butler Uncle Cheng. \"May I trouble you to bring a dagger over!\"\"Alright!\" After taking a look at Master Lu Chen and noticing the lack of disapproval, Uncle Cheng turns around and walks out. After a short moment, he returns with a dagger and passes it to Zhang Xuan.\"Then, I will be making an embarrassment of myself!\"Grabbing the dagger, Zhang Xuan walks over to the painting and stabs the dagger into it.\"What are you doing?\" Seeing his actions, Bai Xun steps forward. \"That is the master's work, every single painting of his is incomparably valuable that some even label them as priceless treasures. Are you sure you can compensate him if you damage it?\"Huang Yu also looks at his actions in bewilderment.Why would you need a dagger to appraise a painting?Ignoring Bai Xun's rebuke, Zhang Xuan cuts the unblemished painting with the dagger.Tzzzzzzz, the sound of paper being cut echoes in the air. The portion of the drawing that was cut curls upwards. Tugging lightly on it, the top portion of the drawing separates from the bottom layer. This is similar to how there are different levels to a building. A layer of xuan paper forms the top layer of the painting, whereas the bottom layer consists of goatskin.Xuan paper -> A type of paper suitable for drawing.Huala!The tearing of the top xuan paper exposes what is on top of the goatskin. There is also a painting on top of the goatskin, and it is similar to what was on the xuan paper. However, there is more spirit to this one and the depictions are much more vivid. It is as though the mountainous rocks, trees, village and children would pop out from within at any moment.\"If I'm not wrong, the drawing on top of the xuan paper is just a layer of deception. The true drawing is imprinted through the xuan paper, onto the goatskin. This is the true secret behind the master's drawing!\" After tearing the xuan paper carefully away, Zhang Xuan smiles.\"This...\"Regardless of whether it is Huang Yu, the butler or Bai Xun, all of their eyes widen in disbelief.To imprint the ink beyond the xuan paper onto the goatskin through force, not to mention that the drawing on top of the paper must retain a certain level of clarity such that no flaws can be seen on it... This is way too incredible!These two paintings are stacked on top of one another flawlessly... How was he able to tell?\"Not bad, not bad!\" Upon seeing the young man easily exposing the secret behind his painting, Master Lu Chen's eyes light up. This time, his gaze towards the youngster is full of praise.At the same time, he is also filled with shock.His ability to imprint on goatskin through a layer of paper via force is something he just comprehended. He had never showcased it in front of anyone else. Yet, this youngster is able to see through it in an instant. His eye of discernment is way too formidable!\"Then, what about this drawing?\"Master Lu Chen turns around and points to a painting hung on the wall.There is a giant savage beast painted on it. Similar to a savage tiger descending from the mountain, its ferocious aura leaves its viewers with astonishment. If a timid person were to catch sight of this painting, they might fall limply onto the ground, fearing to make a single noise.Zhang Xuan steps forward and strokes it lightly. Then, he smiles, \"This painting isn't bad, but it is lacking in disposition. If I am not wrong, the painter of the work has never seen the savage beast portrayed in the drawing before! This drawing is just based on his personal interpretation!\"\"This...\"Master Lu Chen's body trembles as his eyes widen into complete circles.Others might be confused by what Zhang Xuan is saying, but he understands what the other party means.That is because this painting is his work as well.The savage beast on the painting is known as 'Chi Xiong', and it is a rare life-form. It is said to possess boundless strength and invincible defense, to the point that no weapon is able to wound it.Just like what the other party said, it is true that he has never met such a life-form. The reason why he was able to draw this painting is because he had flipped through numerous books so as to feed his imagination.This painting is one of his prided works. This is also the reason why it is hung on the middlemost location of the lounge. Innumerable painting masters have come to visit and they are filled with praises for it. They all find the painting majestic and lifelike. Why would the youngster say that it is lacking in disposition?Since the other party is able to see through the overall situation behind the other painting in an instant, his eye for such stuff should be top-notch. Furthermore, he was able to tell that he had never seen a Chi Xiong just by glancing at the painting, so it is very probable that he has his own reasons for saying so!\"Which part of it is lacking in disposition, would you be kind to enlighten me?\"At this point, Master Lu Chen no longer has the attitude of superiority from before as he hurriedly asks.\"Ah?\"Seeing the emperor's tutor who kept testing them, causing them to scratch their heads helplessly innumerable times, seeking guidance with humility from a young man who isn't even twenty yet, Huang Yu and Bai Xun stare at one another and they feel like fainting.Especially Huang Yu, her eyes can't stop blinking. The shock strikes her mind like billowing waves.That fellow... how did he do it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: PeerTranslator: StarveCleric Editor: Thaddpole&Tortex\u201cThat's simple!\u201d Oblivious to the shock and the thoughts going through the minds of the others, Zhang Xuan smiles. \u201cEven though the Chi Xiong is known for its invincible defense, its body is streamlined like a sharp sword. It specializes in quick assaults and overcomes its opponents through speed rather than strength! From this, it can be inferred that its disposition should be that of a sharp sword rather than a heavy mountain. Given how the painter got the disposition of the savage beast wrong, it is clear to see that it is an interpretation.\u201dMaster Lu Chen's body sways.It isn't that the other party is inaccurate in his appraisal, but he is too accurate in it!All along, he had thought that since the Chi Xiong is known for its invincible defense, its disposition should be heavy like a mountain. The reminder from the youngster makes him recall an introduction on the savage beast from a book. It mentions that it is extremely fast, killing its opponent without even revealing itself. This is precisely the reason why very few people have seen its true form!One of the greatest taboos of a painter is to mistake the disposition their painting should carry. If even the disposition is unfitting for the subject, then even the most valuable of paintings will be reduced to trash. Zhang Xuan is already sparing his pride by saying that the painting isn't bad, instead of saying something more extreme.\u201cExcellent! Incredible!\u201d With his face flushed red with excitement, Master Lu Chen expresses his high appraisal of Zhang Xuan.If it is just a single painting, it is possible that it might just be luck or coincidence. However, to see the crux behind two different paintings in an instant, he can confidently say that the youngster before him might look young, but he is a true master painter!His skills can only be superior to his own!It is easy to make friends, but it is hard to find a soulmate. Throughout his career as a painter, he is unable to find an equal in the entire Tianxuan Kingdom. Usually, when he deciphers a painting to the others, they would only respond to it perfunctorily and instead, focus their efforts on praising him. No one was able to truly understand the essence of those paintings, needless to say, to point out the flaws in them.Friend kind of soulmateThis is precisely the reason why he feels desolate, and often opens up his residence to encourage diligent juniors in the hope that there will be someone to succeed him.At this moment, upon meeting someone who is able to point out the flaws and weaknesses of a painting, he feels as though he has met a soulmate. How can he not be delighted over it?If not for his strong will and self-control, he might have leaped in joy on the spot.Seeing the master so exuberant, Huang Yu and Bai Xun no longer bicker and stare at one another. Their eyes widen into complete circles, almost popping out from their heads.They have been acquainted with this master since young. He is always calm, and no matter what comes in his way, he never allows it to interfere with his mind. The last time the emperor sent some servants to deliver the \u3010Harsh Lands Night Illumination Pearl\u3011 to him, a gift that is worth a king's ransom, he didn't even take a look at it before ordering a servant to keep it in the warehouse.Yet, a casual answer from the young man leaves him in such a state\u2026 Could it be that his words are true?At this point, the two of them shot their gazes towards the young man. However, no matter how they stare at him, he looks nothing but ordinary to them.\u201cXiao Yu, aren't you going to introduce this gongzi to me?\u201dWhile she is still struck with bewilderment, Master Lu Chen's words echo in the room.\u201cIntroduce? He\u2026\u201d Upon being questioned, Huang Yu is taken back. Only now does she realize that she had not asked for the other party's name. Her face turns red and she scratches her head awkwardly as she turns towards Zhang Xuan and asks, \u201cAh, right, what is your name\u2026\u201dHearing these words, Bai Xun, who is sitting beside her, looks constipated.Just a moment ago, he was still overwhelmed by jealousy, thinking that someone has beaten him to his goddess, causing the urge to beat up this youngster to well up in him. Only now does he realize that\u2026 Huang Yu doesn't even know his name!If only he knew earlier, he wouldn't have gotten so angry over nothing.However, his dilemma doesn't end here. Immediately after, he hears Master Lu Chen's angry voice, \u201cWhat do you mean by he! No decorum at all! This little brother here is a peer of mine, you will have to address him as a master in the future!\u201d\u201cPeer?\u201dThis time, not only Huang Yu and Bai Xun feel dizzy-headed, even the butler Uncle Cheng freezes in shock. The three of them stare at Zhang Xuan as though they are looking at a monster.What kind of standing does Master Lu Chen possess?Emperor Shen Zhui's teacher, a true emperor's tutor!There isn't a single person in the entire kingdom who dares to claim to be his peer. If one were to do it, it would mean that one is claiming to be the senior of the country's emperor!For a person of such standing to view a youngster who isn't even twenty as a fellow peer of his? Surely I am hearing things?\u201cDidn't you all hear my words?\u201dSeeing the two of them in a daze, Lu Chen chastises them again.\u201cYes!\u201d Bai Xun and Huang Yu hurriedly bow. \u201cPaying respect to the master!\u201d\u201cThere is no need to be so formal!\u201d Zhang Xuan didn't expect Lu Chen to be so polite. He nods his head helplessly and says, \u201cI am Zhang Xuan. I just happen to understand master's paintings out of coincidence. I am not fitting of the title of a master!\u201d\u201cSo it is little brother Zhang Xuan. You can't put it like that, manners are manners! You are able to see through the flaws in my work with just a glance, this means that you are well-versed in paintings, and you possess an exceptional eye for them. If you aren't worthy of the title of master with your standards, wouldn't that mean that I am unable to live up to my title as a master as well?\u201d Lu Chen says.Zhang Xuan laughs dryly.It is true that he is able to point the flaws in the paintings, but that isn't because of his abilities in that aspect. He only made use of the cheat called the Library of Heaven's Path.Without this, needless to say appraising it, he might be scratching his head with a confused expression, unable to even identify what is being drawn.\u201cAlright, stop being so polite. Feel free to reprimand these juniors when you meet them in the future!\u201dUnsure about what Zhang Xuan is thinking about, Lu Chen casually says.\u201cJuniors? Feel free to reprimand?\u201dBai Xun and Huang Yu are on the verge of crying.The heck, we are around the same age and yet you became a senior of our grandfather's generation in an instant\u2026 Dude, you are way too formidable!Ignoring the despondent duo, Master Lu Chen looks over in puzzlement, \u201cLittle brother, to follow Xiao Yu here, you probably aren't here for leisure. May I ask what is it that you require my help on?\u201d\u201cI have heard that master has a wide collection of books. The reason why I am here today is to find some Fighter 6-dan cultivation technique manuals to browse through\u2026\u201dHearing Master Lu Chen question his purpose, Zhang Xuan hurriedly replies.The main aim of his journey here is this, he mustn't let this opportunity slip him by.\u201cMy collection of books is quite vast, but they are mainly on painting. I do not possess many books on cultivation techniques here. As for those on Fighter 6-dan, I only have a couple of them. They are in my study. Come, I will bring you over to take a look!\u201dHearing his purpose, Master Lu Chen strokes his beard with a smile and stands up.\u201cLaoye, your study\u2026\u201d The butler Uncle Cheng quickly walks forward and asks questioningly. Laoye -> Old MasterLaoye's study does possess quite a lot of one-of-kind limited edition books, and each of them are extremely valuable. He has never allowed any outsiders to enter his study, and even Emperor Shen Zhui was blocked at the door when he came the previous time!There was a maid who wasn't aware of the rules and ran in to clean the room. In the end, she was beaten to death!This is precisely the reason why the study of the Lu residence is the forbidden zone within forbidden zones, and no one dares to enter it\u2026Yet, laoye intends to bring in a young man who he had just met, leaving him at a loss.\u201cThe reason why I don't allow others to enter my study is for fear that they would afflict it with their vulgarity. Little brother Zhang Xuan is a fellow peer of mine and a master painter. It is an honor of mine to have him enter to offer me some pointers. There is no reason for me to stop him from entering at all.\u201dMaster Lu Chen's face darkens.\u201cYes!\u201d Uncle Cheng retreats in a fluster.He may be ignorant about painting, but even he is able to tell at this point that there isn't a single error in the appraisal of the young man!Otherwise, it is impossible for laoye's attitude to do an 180 degree turn and act so amiably.\u201cLet's go!\u201dMaster Lu Chen leads the way while Zhang Xuan follows behind him. After a moment, they reach a wide room.As expected of a master whom Huang Yu was full of praises for, the collection of books in his study is massive. All kinds of manuals fill the shelves, and there are at least hundreds of thousands of books here. Zhang Xuan feels as though he has walked into a library.Walking between the shelves while taking a casual look, it is exactly as the other party said. The books are all on painting, and there are barely any on cultivation techniques and martial arts.\u201cThose on cultivation technique are over here. There are only a handful of them. They were left behind from back when I was still cultivating!\u201dMaster Lu Chen introduces with a smile as he brings Zhang Xuan towards the corner of the study.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
