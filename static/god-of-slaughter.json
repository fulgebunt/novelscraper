His head was throbbing in pain.Once he had recovered slightly, he looked around and found himself in a dim stone cave which was as big as a basketball court. Piles of bones were scattered all over the place and a dozen corpses in strange clothes lay beside him. The clothes looked new and bright. These people had died recently.\u201cWhere am I? Is this still the Bahamas?\u201dShi Yan, 27 years old, was an extreme sports fanatic. His mother died early, while his father died of cancer in the prime of his life. This left him with such a large amount of wealth which he could never use in a lifetime.He owned many things at an early age, which other people would pursue for their entire life.Although young and rich, he had no future goals, which made him unhappy for a long time.It wasn\u2019t until he was 17 that he had his first taste of extreme sports, which brought him unspeakable excitement. Given his large amount of wealth, he could undertake these sports as much as he liked, while ordinary people would not able to afford this.Those classic extreme sports, such as free-climbing, crocodile bungee, low-altitude parachuting, volcanic skateboarding, cliff diving and limbo skating, brought Shi Yan the greatest pleasure. He enjoyed the thrill of death that invigorated him and made his blood boil.In ten years, he had tried all sorts of dangerous extreme sports which had built up Shi Yan\u2019s extraordinarily strong body. Hundreds of near-death experiences made his nerves as hard as steel. He once joked that he was the man who was the closest to the Grim Reaper.The blue-hole exploration in the Bahamas was the most dangerous extreme sport he ever took part in. Some of these blue-holes were hundreds of meters deep, while some were complex like mazes. What\u2019s more, every little move could stir the sand up on the bottom of the cave. No matter how bright your light was, you wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything in front of you.Even if you were an experienced diver, you had to wear a steel wire before you jumped into a blue-hole. The steel wire was the lifeline of explorers, the length of which decided the distance explorers could go. Moving beyond that distance was tantamount to suicide, because nobody could get out of that maze without a steel wire. According to the statistics from the Bahamas Maritime Institute, there was an average of 20 cave diving related deaths in the blue-hole, most of whom died from losing direction.In this most dangerous extreme adventure, Shi Yan threw away his lifeline; the steel wire, entering into a suicidal adventure, and finally lost himself in the mysterious blue-hole.And in the blue-hole, getting lost would mean certain death.\u2014Shi Yan lay collapsed on the ice-cold rock ground, looking at his surroundings with the aid of a dim light coming from the cave walls. In his mind there appeared some memory fragments that didn\u2019t belong to him.This was the memory of another Shi Yan\u2026That boy was 17 years old, and had the same name as himself. Attracted to antiques, that boy was obsessed with all kinds of historical remains; and because of an ancient map, he strived for half a year and eventually got here with his guards.Feeling weak all over, Shi Yan frowned and slowly lifted himself up.Just then, to his surprise, Shi Yan noticed that this body was not his own, but that of the other Shi Yan who was only 17 years old.He was dumbstruck for a moment.\u201cDid I die in the blue-hole? No! I am still alive, but in an unbelievable way!\u201dAccording to the other Shi Yan\u2019s memory, this place was called Grace Mainland, where there was no science or technology. No soldiers or wars.Many dwellers here showed mysterious abilities not long after they were born. Some had the power of lightning, some could control plants, some could tunnel into the earth, some could use the chill of frost, and some were capable of communicating with demon beasts\u2026People with these various abilities would all become warriors, and their abilities were referred to as Martial Spirits.Martial Spirits were something one was born with, and only very few could acquire a spirit through some stroke of luck. That is why this mainland was named Grace Mainland, as the warriors believed that Martial Spirits were a gift from God.The majority of warriors weren\u2019t blessed with a Martial Spirit. Ordinary people could train hard to become a warrior, but there was no way to obtain a Martial Spirit through training. Martial Spirits were so powerful that they could benefit a warrior\u2019s training, increasing their combat potential significantly and granting them their own special abilities\u2026As a result, among warriors of same level, those who owned a Martial Spirit tended to be stronger, and achieved greater results. They did half the work with double the results.There was a higher probability where one inherited the Martial Spirit.In general, if one of the parents possessed a spirit, there was a high possibility that their kid would inherit the same spirit. If both of the parents had a spirit, their child would have an even greater chance to inherit one of their spirits, either from the father or the mother.There was only a one in a hundred chance that a couple, who both possessed a spirit, would give birth to an ordinary child.Even rarer was the situation where the kid inherited both spirits from his parents. This inherent type of Martial Spirit was called Twin Spirits, and those type of lucky individuals which possessed them were also known as a \u2018Son of God\u2019! It only happened to one in ten thousand couples who possessed different Spirits.Shi Yan stood there and continued to put the foreign memories into order.The original owner of this body came from the Shi Family. They possessed the Petrification Martial Spirit which could make the body as hard as a rock in battle, preventing damage to the body. As said fighter raised their cultivation, the Petrification Martial Spirit would become much stronger, to the point where they were almost indestructible.Unfortunately, this guy didn\u2019t inherit the Petrification Martial Spirit, and was thus considered a poor successor for the martial arts that the Shi Family trained in. He also showed no interest in martial arts, and never learned anything about them either. All he had been devoted to was the exploration of historical remains.Thanks to that ancient map, he had crawled through numerous heavy bushes and suffered a lot to arrive at this ancient cave.\u201cWu wu wu\u2026. hu hu hu\u2026. \u201dSuddenly a devil-like cry came from the deep within the cave. Astonished, Shi Yan looked around to find a blood pool in the direction the voice came from.The blood pool, about 10 square meters in size, was located in the middle of the cave, filled with a red fluid which look just like blood. It was bubbling on the surface and was giving out horrifying shrieks and howls when the bubbles popped.He realized that his escorts were driven insane by the howls, and they had started to kill each other. They all died in succession, while the 17 year old Shi Yan fainted.It was all because of the blood pool!Shi Yan stared at the blood pool with a rigid face. The howls slowly evoked the desire to kill within him, and made him want to kill anyone around him!His head was still aching and the howls from the blood pool never stopped tormenting him, which made it hard for him to concentrate.\u201c\u2026.Must be the blood pool!\u201dHis countless near-death experiences had steeled his mind and Shi Yan managed to calm down. Although his head still ached, he was able to stay focused, and walked towards the blood pool.\u201cCrack, crack, crack!\u201dShi Yan looked dignified, while gray dry bones shattered under his feet. Judging by the pile of bones in the cave, he could only guess how many people had previously died in this place. The pool was the source of this evil. If he wanted to examine the secrets of the blood pool, he had to be prepared for death.The howls were getting louder and louder as he got closer to the blood pool, which drilled into his head like sharp knives. The sound of slaughter contained in the howls almost destroyed his reasoning. He wouldn\u2019t have been able to bear this pain if it weren\u2019t for the extreme conditioning he faced for so many years that had slowly formed his spirit.A heap of bones was situated beside the blood pool; some milky white bones also floated in the centre of the pool. This small blood pool was like the Shura blood sea, which had devoured an uncountable number of lives.Shi Yan had a feeling that his soul was summoned here because of this bizarre blood pool. He thought maybe this blood pool was his ticket back to the blue-hole in the Bahamas.When he got closer to the blood pool, Shi Yan suddenly found something strange. The blood in the middle of the pool was scarlet and thick, but he couldn\u2019t detect the slightest whiff of blood.On the contrary, the air around him was very fresh, even filled with an unexplainable fragrance. After careful inspection, he determined that the exotic fragrance actually came from the blood pool!Shi Yan was full of curiosity, and thought that there must be something weird in the blood pool.Again, he took a few steps forward. All of a sudden, an illusion of an endless sea, filled with scarlet red blood entered his mind. Countless corpses had accumulated to form islands. Some of the bones were like those of the cretaceous period dinosaurs and were as large as a small hill. There was a sound coming out from the blood sea, repeatedly screaming \u201cKill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!\u201dShi Yan tried to stay calm, but he couldn\u2019t. His heart started to beat faster and faster. A suffocating and terrifying pressure overwhelmed him. He felt a familiar touch knew that he had never been this close to death before.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe knew that the next step likely meant death!However, those dreary adventures over the years hadn\u2019t terrified him, but instead had given him the utmost pleasure! Being face to face with death and surviving all perils was the true definition of extreme sports!Step by step, one after the other!Under the call of the blood pool, Shi Yan finally went up to the edge. He stared at the small blood pool; the insane side of his character had been triggered. He roared, \u201cLet\u2019s see what you have to offer, small blood pool!\u201dThen he jumped into the pool.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2 The Body RemodelledAs Shi Yan entered the blood pool, the blood was already up to his waist. Suddenly the blood in the pool started to move around as if it was alive, creeping up and down his body like vines. Seconds later, his whole body was covered with blood and tightly bound.The crimson blood in the pool was like vicious snakes, untiringly wrapping around him until it formed a bloody cocoon.A wave of intense pain spread throughout his body. Shi Yan felt as if his brain was being sliced into pieces. It felt even worse than death. It was as if tens of millions of tiny worms were drilling into his body and squirming around in his arms, legs, bones and viscera; eating away at his blood and flesh.Shi Yan couldn\u2019t see anything. He wanted to scream, but couldn\u2019t make a sound, and neither could his body move.A strange liquid started flowing slowly along his ribs like a small stream and tore open his veins wherever it passed. Then the liquid rapidly accelerated and divided into numerous strands, madly surging into the seven hundred and twenty meridians within his body.The pain in his head grew stronger, Shi Yan felt some weird changes happening within his meridians[1]. He felt that his seven hundred and twenty meridians had enlarged significantly, as they interchanged between feeling scorching hot and biting cold. It felt extremely uncomfortable.Soon after, his meridians turned into a little cyclones and were swirling madly.A small amount of the liquid infused itself into every cyclone and was swiftly absorbed into them. After absorbing the liquid, the cyclones became enlarged and the process accelerated.The intensity of the pain was almost unbearable. He felt that his body was like a huge vessel, filled with the strange liquid. It was transforming him in ways he couldn\u2019t possibly comprehend.\u201cThe liquid is transforming the meridians in my body\u2026\u201dAs this thought flashed through his mind, he fainted.\u2014After a long time, Shi Yan awoke again.The searing pain had disappeared and was replaced by a numb pain in his meridians. The liquid had returned to its origin and blood pool was tranquil.Unexpectedly, he felt a warm sensation flowing through his body. After this sensation made a complete cycle, he felt extraordinary comfortable and his body had increased in strength.\u201cProfound Qi!\u201d[2]It dawned on him that it originated from the blood pool! This is the precious Qi which could only be obtained by warriors!Within the memory of the other Shi Yan, he came to know that Profound Qi was the source of power for warriors. It was the foundation for warriors to support and release powerful martial arts.Warriors were strictly ranked into ten grades, according to the strength of their Profound Qi. These were Elementary, Nascent, Human, Disaster, Earth, Nirvana, Sky, Spirit, True God and King God[3], with each grade containing three divisions.Warriors were stronger than commoners. Profound Qi determines the status one would have. One could be called a warrior as long as he possessed the slightest amount of Profound Qi.The vast majority of people couldn\u2019t obtain any Profound Qi throughout their entire life. Once obtained, they could strengthen it simply by training. Therefore, as long as a warrior possessed Qi, they would always have a place to return to.As the weak Profound Qi gently circulated throughout his body, Shi Yan came to his senses. Even if he couldn\u2019t go back to his world, he would survive here. Just then he noticed that the blood cocoon was still tightly wrapped around him.Shi Yan spared no effort to struggle.\u201cHEYA!\u201dThe blood cocoon cracked, and Shi Yan jumped out. Looking around, he found himself in that odd cave with the bones everywhere.However, the blood pool had all dried up! Only a few pieces of broken bones were left!A huge glittering blood cocoon, as thin as a wafer, towered in the centre of the empty pool. After Shi Yan glanced it, a small flame ignited at the bottom of the cocoon. The flame grew wildly and started to burn the bones. In a few minutes, the blood cocoon and the bones were all burnt to nothingness. A red light sparkled in the dry pool. There was a sparkling delicate ring quietly lying there.Shi Yan stared at the strange ring for a while and assumed this ring must have some connection with the blood pool. After a few seconds of hesitation, he stepped in again, picked up the ring, and wore it on the ring finger of his left hand.The ring conveyed a warmth that made Shi Yan feel strongly connected to it, as if the ring had become a part of his body. All at once, the weak Profound Qi in his body lost control and rushed towards the crimson ring. However, it was blocked by the skin of his finger and failed to enter the ring.Shi Yan was shocked and tried to take off the ring immediately, only to find that the ring had been firmly placed onto his ring finger like an unmovable boulder. No matter how hard he tried, the ring wouldn\u2019t move an inch.Now that the Profound Qi couldn\u2019t break the skin, it went back to normal after a while. The warmth and red gleam on the ring faded away as well.The ring kept silent after that, thus Shi Yan started to analyze the situation.\u201cThe blood in the pool must have purified my body\u201dThe blood pool was ten square meters in size. Though not huge, the blood it contained would weigh at least a few tons. There was no way for an elephant to hold that much liquid inside its body!Shi Yan turned pale. He subconsciously looked around and wanted to see how his body had changed. Had it swelled up?He was incredibly anxious!To his surprise, his body was only skin and bones! The clothes on him looked ridiculously large now. It was better to call him a withered mummy.Shi Yan turned even paler. He never expected that this blood pool would not only fail to send him back to his previous world, but would make such inconceivable changes to him.\u201cGuru~ Guru~!!\u201dHis stomach began rumbling and he suddenly felt extremely ravenous. He thought he could almost devour an elephant.But there was nothing to eat in the cave. He glanced at the dry blood pool and was sad to find that he could no longer return to his world.Shi Yan decided to find a weapon. He remembered those escorts had fought against each other with all kinds of weapons. However, after he examined them, he found that all of the weapons had rusted or been destroyed, none of which could be used anymore.Crestfallen, Shi Yan could only leave empty-handed from the stone cave.\u2014There was a heatwave in the moist air, with the sound of rippling water running in the distance. Ancient trees rose from the ground and blocked the sun like a giant umbrella. Only a few spots of sunlight could be seen on the wetland.The Dark Forest! Shi Yan recalled this place with the help of the memory of his new body once he got out of the cave.The Dark Forest covered a large area, where the trees were too thick to let the sunlight in. Thus the forest was damp and dark even in the daytime. That was the reason it was called the Dark Forest.The Dark Forest was surrounded by the Merchant Union, the Fire Empire and the God-blessed Empire[4]. The Merchant Union was to the north of the forest, the God-blessed Empire in the south, and the Fire Empire in the west. Merchants from the three countries had to pass through the Dark Forest to trade.Demon beasts always made their appearance in the Dark Forest, some of which even reached the 6th or 7th grade. As the trade caravans, soldiers, and warriors crossed the Dark Forest now and then, they knew that demon beasts of a high level only appear in special areas, and those of a low level were usually vagrants.In general, trade caravans wouldn\u2019t come across high level demon beasts as long as they travelled along their usual routes. However, soldiers and warriors often adventured into the beast-infested areas looking for fights.Great risk yields great benefits. Once a soldier killed a demon beast of the 6th or 7th level, he would immediately obtain a large amount of crystal coins. Each demon beast above level 6 had a monster core inside its body. This monster core was of great use to warriors, alchemists, and blacksmiths.Apart from the monster core, its fur, fangs, bones, flesh, and poison were all very valuable. The body of a high-grade demon beast was full of treasures.This attracted bold soldiers and warriors to adventure into the Dark Forest. However, only a few people would achieve their goals and gain some benefits. The majority of them underestimated the wisdom and strength of a demon beast and thus, paid for it with their lives.Shi Yan observed his surroundings for a while and heard the sound of water off in the distance, combined with the sound of women talking.As Shi Yan was hesitating, he noticed a slight rustling sound from the bushes not far away, as if someone was fiddling with the leaves.Shi Yan subconsciously looked towards that direction.Through the thick bushes he saw a slim and graceful female body. The woman took off her white belt, squatted down, and showed her peach-shaped white bottom to him. Her snow-white hand was waving off annoying mosquitoes, as she was about to urinate\u2026The woman apparently didn\u2019t notice the eyes behind her, as she began to sing happily\u2026At first Shi Yan was stunned. However he was soon enchanted by that charming white butt and couldn\u2019t move his eyes.\u201cPa!\u201dThe woman suddenly clapped on her smooth, white left hip to kill a mosquito. The movement of her butt captivated Shi Yan.Soon the woman finished urinating, re-buckled her belt, and muttered to herself, \u201cDamn mosquitos\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, the woman turned around quickly. Her hands sent out a green arc of lightning which targeted all the surrounding mosquitoes and killed them on the spot.As she turned, Shi Yan finally saw her delicate appearance. She looked around 20 years old and five and half feet in height. Her face was glowing like a bright moon and she had a slim waist, full chest, and nice posture. She was wearing an exquisite lavender robe and silver soft armor which couldn\u2019t cover her fascinating figure as a legendary wild vixen.Shi Yan focused on her hot body and thought to himself that she was more beautiful than the most popular superstars in his world.Shi Yan couldn\u2019t stop his eyes from wandering. Suddenly, the woman looked directly into his eyes though the huge banana leaves.The beauty\u2019s eyes flashed like lightning!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Meridan: the acupoints in one\u2019s body.[2] Profound Qi: important essence for a warrior.[3] Elementary, Nascent, Human, Disaster, Earth, Nirvana, Sky, Spirit, True God and King God: ten warriors ranks.[4] The Merchant Union, The Fire Empire and The God-blessed Empire: Three unions surrounding the Dark Forest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I\u2019d say it was a feast for the eyes.\u201d Shi Yan was strangely honest.\u201cYou want to see some more?\u201d Mo Yanyu was furious. She had never met such a shamelessness man.\u201cWell, if you wouldn\u2019t mind taking your pants off, and don\u2019t mind me staring at you, then yes, I would love to take a closer look.\u201d Shi Yan smiled.Apparently, Shi Yan didn\u2019t want to pretend to be somebody he was not. Before he came to this world, every time he finished some extreme sport, he would have to find a woman for pleasure. Extreme sports was his biggest enthusiasm, while women were the most important spice in his life.Mo Yanyu almost jumped up and down on her feet.Who the hell is this guy?! What a bastard! Looks like a ghost and came out of nowhere. Every word he says is so shameless and he even seems to be proud of himself. If there is a competition for shameless bastards, he would be holding the crown.Mo Yanyu had to take a deep breath before she began to talk again, while her beautiful breasts heaved up and down, a surge of rage bloomed in her chest. Surprisingly, she laughed, \u201cNice! Good! Very Good! \u201dHearing her say this, Shi Yan was even happier, and a horny smile appeared on his face. \u201cWow, it seems you don\u2019t mind at all. Well, please go ahead. I am really looking forward to it. I didn\u2019t pay much attention the last time, but this time I won\u2019t miss anything.\u201dMo Yanyu was completely shocked by Shi Yan\u2019s response. After she figured out he wasn\u2019t teasing, she couldn\u2019t control her rage anymore. \u201cWon\u2019t miss anything my ass!\u201dCursing, Mo Yanyu crossed her arms. Her hands were suddenly surrounded by shining green light. She spread her arms, shooting a green beam as sharp as lightning towards Shi Yan.[Verdant Crescent Slash][1]Within seconds, a green light flashed by. All things between the two were cut into pieces. With an unstoppable force, the green lightning struck Shi Yan\u2019s right in the chest.\u201cBoom!\u201dShi Yan was lifted off the ground and tossed backwards. His skeleton-like body couldn\u2019t balance himself and fell hard into a thicket.His chest was badly lacerated to the point where bones were visible. Feeling such a searing pain like that, he almost felt like dying.Following the [Verdant Crescent Slash], the path between the two people was clear. Everything in between had been turned to dust.Mo Yanyu made her move towards Shi Yan, her face as cold as ice.Shi Yan finally came back to his senses. The intense pain in his chest made him realize that the girl in front of him wasn\u2019t easy to deal with.In the world where he came from, even if he did the same thing, the worst case scenario the girl calling him an asshole or filing a lawsuit against him; nothing like this.He was still new to this place and was not used to the cruel way of life here.Especially in the Dark Forest! Because this forest was not subject to any country\u2019s jurisdiction and also contained a large variety of demon beasts as well as precious and exotic herbs, warriors took the forest to be their training grounds, while mercenaries and merchants saw this place as a natural treasure trove.There were no restriction and no rules in this forest. Due to the demon beasts and precious herbs here, robbery and murder were never strangers in this place. Betrayal and back-stabbing were also old friends within this forest. What an insane place!The law of the jungle ruled the Dark Forest. The strong devour the weak.This was exactly why he got hit so hard. He let his guard down, never expecting a girl like her would attempt to kill him for such a trivial reason.Shi Yan\u2019s mind was suddenly crystal clear.The weak remaining Profound Qi inside of him gradually gathered around his wounds on his chest and began to heal him. With his Profound Qi moving around his body, the searing pain lessened.Footsteps on the wet ground indicated that Mo Yanyu was approaching. Shi Yan jumped up nervously, calmed his mind, and looked straight at the girl walking slowly towards him.\u201cYou intended to kill me?\u201d\u201cStill breathing?\u201d Mo Yanyu frowned slightly, and stopped about 25 meters in front of Shi Yan. She took a curious but careful glance at him, and thought, \u201cThere is Profound Qi inside of him. A novice warrior. It seems I should have hit him harder\u2026\u201dShi Yan got serious this time, with no more teasing or joking. He focused his attention on the girl because he knew that she\u2019d strike again soon.He could feel his Qi was more concentrated than ever. This was a matter of life and death. He couldn\u2019t afford any mistakes. Shi Yan quickly adjusted himself and returned to the coolheaded state he always maintained during his extreme sports.At that moment, he couldn\u2019t feel any pain in his chest. He could feel nothing but the weak Profound Qi flowing through his body and rushing through his veins, getting faster and faster. The next moment, a wild surge of energy erupted from the deepest corner of his body. The feeling was mind-blowing. He felt like his brain had exploded. After that, the whole world suddenly became silent.\u201cBadump! Badump!\u201dShi Yan could hear his own heartbeat loud and clear. With his heartbeat racing, the cells throughout his whole body were activated. Every inch of his body became so sensitive and he could feel everything taking place around him. He could even feel the slightest tremor on his skin when a little light breeze brushed against his body.The strangest energy started to spread from every pore of his body, pouring into his veins and bones. It felt like electricity speeding throughout his entire vascular system.After an acute pain in Shi Yan\u2019s eyes, the world in front of him became incredibly colorful and vivid. He was able to see the tiniest details on every leaf. He looked at the woman who was a combination of extreme beauty and cruelty, feeling her Profound Qi flowing underneath her skin in a beautiful rhythm in her veins.The forest was still the same. But to his eyes, it was like a completely different world out there.Before Shi Yan could enjoy this wonderful feeling some more, he suddenly sensed that the Profound Qi inside the woman\u2019s body was flowing at double the rate as before.Shi Yan could even feel his nerves trembling.Subconsciously, he pushed his left foot off the ground with all the force he had. With a strong power rushing out of his foot, Shi Yan quickly moved away from where he was standing.Another green blaze in the shape of a dagger almost left a mark on him.The green lightning cut everything by his side with a horrifying force. This time the attack was much more precise and stronger than the previous strike.Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help sweating; maybe it was nervousness, maybe it was excitement.This was the first time that Shi Yan had experienced the type of fight that could kill within seconds. How cool was that! This was truly a battle of life and death. He enjoyed this more than any kind of extreme sports.In the old world where he came from, there were all kinds of extreme sports available. However, the law, moral codes, and rational thinking were like a huge cage, keeping him prisoner. He couldn\u2019t do things without boundaries, he couldn\u2019t indulge in his passions, couldn\u2019t touch the wires of law and moral codes.But here, in this world where only the powerful ruled, nothing was prohibited. Nothing was impossible!Shi Yan suddenly felt excitement growing inside of him. He felt this might be the right place for him. This might just be his paradise!\u2026\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Mo Yanyu couldn\u2019t hide her surprise. She didn\u2019t expect Shi Yan to evade this attack. She was so sure that he would be torn into pieces in this strike and didn\u2019t prepare for Plan B.Hearing her voice, Shi Yan who was still enjoying his survival had just now come back to his senses.Without hesitation, Shi Yan jumped up like an agile monkey. He grabbed a vine on a tree and swung himself forward. He then grabbed another vine with lightning speed, flew forward, and reached for the next vine. In a series of smooth movements, he managed to approach Mo Yanyu within seconds.When he was bouldering, the vines on the mountain were indeed a handy tool. For an extreme sports enthusiast like Shi Yan, swinging with the support of vines was a natural instinct.Like a wild monkey, Shi Yan was moved quickly through all the vines and trees. He didn\u2019t follow a specific pattern, but managed to approach Mo Yanyu.Mo Yanyu had scorn on her face, and shot more and more green light daggers into the sky, destroying every vine in the direction of Shi Yan. However, he was able to escape her attacks by a hair\u2019s breadth every time and quickly grasped onto another vine.The truth was, Shi Yan could already sense the movement of Qi in Mo Yanyu\u2019s body. He everything was crystal clear to him now. When he saw a surge of Profound Qi underneath her skin, he would quickly move in another direction.During his movements, Shi Yan started to feel that the blood in the pool had changed him somehow. He was not that strong before, but now, not only did the high-intensity movements not tear him apart, they also made him even more sensitive and agile than ever before. His senses became sharper and his body became stronger and more flexible.\u201cShwish!\u201dWith a loud noise, a sharp green lightning flew towards him, tearing apart dozens of vines behind him. Apparently, Mo Yanyu almost exhausted her Profound Qi after such strong attack.\u201cThis is my chance!\u201dShi Yan suddenly jumped down from the trees, taking Mo Yanyu in his arms like a greedy eagle. Before she could gather enough Profound Qi to strike back, Shi Yan was already on top of her.\u201cBoom!\u201d Mo Yanyu fell on the ground with Shi Yan on top of her, tightly bringing her body under his control.Face to face, Shi Yan could feel her soft body more closely. Her plump breasts felt so delicious and fragrant, he squeezed the buns up close to his burning chest.Shi Yan felt pleasure that was beyond any words, secretly appreciating the woman\u2019s body. What a piece of art! Unlike the ordinary women from his old world who looked sexy and plump on the outside, they were nothing without bras.\u201cLet go of me!\u201d Mo Yanyu expressed her disgust but didn\u2019t really struggle. She cursed, \u201cFucking let go of me! If you ever want to see the sunlight again! \u201d\u201cBitch!\u201d Shi Yan sneered, \u201cYou almost killed me. Why should I let you go so easily?\u201dMo Yanyu suddenly became nervous. Before she could do anything, she felt the kiss of this creep on her beautiful and sacred face. At the same time, the bastard\u2019s hands didn\u2019t rest either. Shi Yan was touching her ass and began to rub it in an insatiable way.Mo Yanyu flew into a rage, the Martial Spirit inside of her exploded with a terrifying power.Shi Yan who was still enjoying this wonderful feast suddenly felt a horrible electric current flowing through her. He was instantly electrocuted, as if he had been struck by a taser. Shi Yan couldn\u2019t feel his own body any more, nor could he gather any Qi inside his body.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMo Yanyu pushed Shi Yan away, her eyes were cruel and icy. She glanced at Shi Yan who was lying on the ground for a while, and cursed again:\u201cI won\u2019t let you die that easily you bastard!\u201dMo Yanyu picked Shi Yan up like a feather, passing through the forest towards the crowd with a cold face.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1]This is the name of the skill Mo Yanyu uses.

    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4 \u2013 Guinea PigTall trees formed a huge umbrella above a small river, beside which was a dragon drinking water, carrying several bags.Ten strong, tall warriors were dining and talking lewdly near the dragon. Behind the dragon, a group of malnourished men were crouching and having a coarse meal. They were all wearing chains, their eyes dim.In a sedan chair on the dragon, a poker-faced thin old man was sitting motionlessly. He was wearing a black robe embroidered with five white cauldrons on his chest. He kept staring at the warriors and the chained men. Every warrior was frightened and turned silent once the old man looked upon them viciously.\u201cAre you done? Then move your ass and walk!\u201d Mo Yanyu showed up from the bush with a rigid face, lifting Shi Yan up in her hand.The warriors wrapped up their unfinished meal and were embarrassed, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re done. We\u2019re done.\u201dMo Yanyu went up to the old man and showed an unwillingly smile, \u201cMaster Karu, have you finished your meal?\u201dThe old man nodded coldly and murmured, \u201cMiss Mo, it will still take 3 months to get to the Merchant Union. However, we have only 16 medicine slaves left. I\u2019m afraid we won\u2019t make it\u2026\u201d\u201cDo not worry, Master Karu. We will catch more medicine slaves for you.\u201d Mo Yanyu threw Shi Yan onto the ground and laughed, \u201cLook, a new slave!\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Karu nodded as he examined Shi Yan with his evil eyes. \u201cToo skinny! He won\u2019t even survive a week!\u201d He frowned.\u201cYes I know. But, he has Profound Qi in him\u2026\u201d Mo Yanyu explained.\u201cHe is a warrior?\u201d Apparently Karu was now interested, and his eyes lit up.\u201cDefinitely!\u201d Mo Yanyu confirmed.\u201cThat is good.\u201d Master Karu smirked. He continued to focus his eyes on Shi Yan. After quite a while, he nodded slowly, \u201cVery good. Miss Mo, feed him. I want him to be strong first. A severely injured warrior cannot bear what I am going to do. It would be a total waste if he died through the course of my medicine when he is still too weak.\u201d\u201cDo not worry Master.\u201d Mo Yanyu wore her rigid face and scolded, \u201cJohnson! What are you doing there! Shackle this man as soon as possible!\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201d This bald, fat man appeared to be six foot six. He took out a new set of shackles from the bags on the dragon and swiftly shackled Shi Yan\u2019s hands and feet.This giant wore heavy armor and his robust muscles looked extremely powerful. The heavy dark armor seemed as light like a feather and didn\u2019t affect him whatsoever while he was moving.\u201cJohnson, take care of him! And always keep an eye on him!\u201d Mo Yanyu glared at Shi Yan in hatred, and rushed to the head of their caravan, not bothering to waste one more second on him.\u201cI can handle it, Miss! I\u2019m the best at it!\u201d The bald man chuckled cunningly and reassured her, punching his chest.Shi Yan observed silently despite his body hurting all over.He knew it would be useless to say anything at the moment. In this dog-eat-dog world, morals was the last thing one should believe in. He will receive no pity and would only become a skeleton and if he didn\u2019t adapt to this world soon.As the Profound Qi flowed slowly within him for a while, Shi Yan felt less pain. However, the newly added shackles were like a mountain on his exposed and feeble body, making every step much harder.\u201cBang!\u201dShi Yan suddenly got lashed by a whip, which was so fast and powerful that his back was cracked open and ached badly. He turned around to see the big man Johnson smirking with a whip in his hand.\u201cDamn medicine slave! Move faster! Or do you want one more lash, huh?\u201d He laughed with an evil smirk on his face.Shi Yan gazed at him for a few seconds and didn\u2019t reply. He staggered towards the medicine slave in front of him, before Johnson could lift his whip again. Every step consumed a lot of energy.After Shi Yan moved forward, Johnson\u2019s smirk disappeared and was replaced by a weird expression\u2026Along the way, many stumbling slaves had been \u2018taken care of\u2019 by Big Johnson, who was famed for his brutality. Two slaves were even beaten to death by him before Master Karu could even test his medicine on them. All of the medicine slaves looked at him with either fear or hatred.However, this man didn\u2019t show the slightest hint of fear or hatred. There was only an incredible silence, cold and solemn.This man didn\u2019t seem to realize his status as a prisoner. Maybe he didn\u2019t clearly understand the situation.The solemn eyes gave Johnson the illusion that he was prey. This made him uncomfortable. However, since Shi Yan had begun obediently marching, Johnson couldn\u2019t find a reason to make a fuss. He swore to himself that he would force Shi Yan to be frightened of him.Big Johnson enjoyed the sight of others\u2019 frightened eyes so much. He found an interesting pleasure in being in control of the life of another.In the following days, Shi Yan stayed mute and obedient. He obeyed every order that was given by Johnson without any resistance. No change of temper, no interest in anything. Shi Yan was different from the other medicine slaves.Even Johnson, who was always waiting for a chance to give him a lesson, couldn\u2019t find any excuse to trick him. Shi Yan was unbelievably cooperative. Johnson was confused.Shi Yan only talked when he asked for food, which was under Master Karu\u2019s permission.In no time, the warriors noticed that Shi Yan had a big appetite and he enjoyed the inferior food. He ate what seven medicine slaves ate as a first meal. And day by day, he ate more and more!The warriors couldn\u2019t believe their eyes. How could that weak skinny body contain so much food! At the beginning they worried that he couldn\u2019t digest it but it soon turned out to be unnecessary.It was clear that Shi Yan had not only digested the inferior food, but also grown much stronger.The changes in Shi Yan\u2019s body pleased Master Karu significantly. This cunning old man allowed Shi Yan to eat as much as he wanted.As Shi Yan grew stronger day by day, Johnson gradually became worried. Every time he looked into Shi Yan\u2019s solemn eyes, Johnson got the premonition that Shi Yan would be a calamity in the future. But still, he couldn\u2019t go against Master Karu\u2019s order and had to supply Shi Yan with enough food.Nevertheless, Johnson knew who Master Karu was and what he could do. Thus he was relieved, and hoped Master Karu would take action soon.After eating enough for 12 people, Shi Yan put down his bowl, licked the last grain of rice from the corner of his mouth, and closed his eyes, neglecting the dumbstruck medicine slaves beside him.That huge amount of food was soon digested in his body, which was like a bottomless pit. It was also like a precise machine that transformed the food into nutrition, supplying his blood, bones, tendons, muscles and inner organs, strengthening his weak body secretly.The injury on his chest had long since recovered. It took only a day and a half and didn\u2019t leave a scar. He felt like was a different man.Only Shi Yan knew precisely what had happened to his own body in such short time. He could sense the transformations in occurring within himself every second!While the nutrition from the food strengthened his body, the weak Profound Qi inside him had also risen by a level during its continuous circulation.Shi Yan could feel a great strength now and the heavy shackles didn\u2019t weigh him down anymore!As he concentrated, he could tell the Qi was flowing from his Dantian, up to the Governor Vessel, down the Reception Vessel, and then balancing the water and fire in the heart and kidney. After it completed a Small Circulation, his Profound Qi grew stronger.Thanks to a little knowledge of Qigong, Shi Yan knew the difference between a Small Circulation and a Big Circulation. A Small Circulation only included the Governor and the Reception Vessels, while a Big Circulation contained the twelve Channels and the other six vessels.Since there were only two vessels; the Governor and the Reception Vessels, which were open among his twelve Channels and eight vessels, he could only complete a Small Circulation. From the other Shi Yan\u2019s memory, he concluded that only warriors of the Elementary level could open all the channels and vessels to conduct a Big Circulation.Shi Yan carried on, for he believed that as long as the Profound Qi residing in him was strong enough, he would open his Channels and Vessels sooner or later!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOne more death! Two slaves have died from the medicinal trials in just six days!\u201d\u201cI saw that! That guy had already grown weak before he died. Terrible! Hideous!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better to commit suicide than die that way! We will die that way too! There is no hope in sight!\u201d\u201cNo suicide, no! Our family won\u2019t get a single blue crystal coin if we commit suicide! Alas! Endure it. We will be free if we survive half a year, and get some money. We must endure until we make it back to our wives and kids!\u201dHearing this, all the medicine slaves went silent. They decided not to commit suicide and made up their minds to carry on.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5 \u2013 Lightning Martial SpiritShi Yan opened his eyes, staring at the medicine slaves at a distance.Those slaves mostly came from poor families. In order to survive, they had no choice but to sign the contract with Mo Yanyu, selling themselves as slaves. If they were lucky enough to survive the first six months, not only could they regain their freedom, but they would also get paid 200 Purple Crystal Coins[1]. If they were unlucky and died from medicinal trials, their family would receive the money instead.In the Grace Mainland, one Black Crystal Coin was equal to 100 Purple Crystal Coins, which equaled 10 thousand Blue Crystal Coins. The annual income of an average citizen was merely 5-6 Purple Crystal Coins. 200 Purple Crystal Coins were almost the savings for 40 years of work in another job.Upon signing the contract, their family would receive 50 Purple Crystal Coins on the spot, with the rest paid within the next six months. If something unfortunate happened, their family would be compensated regardless. It might take someone\u2019s entire life to make 200 Purple Crystal Coins. But for the medicine claves, all it takes is six months of painful suffering. It was all worth it. At least that was what they thought\u2026However, when they signed the contract, it never occurred to them that the medicinal trials would be so cruel and tormenting. Every few days, some of them would drop dead in the most horrible way. This made them so terrified that they began to make their own secret plans.But a contract was a contract. Once they signed their name on it, there was no way out. This meant, for the next six months, the Mo family[2] owned their lives. Any attempt to disobey the contract, or escape from the Mo family, would be a death sentenced.There is no such thing as a free lunch. It was already too late for them to recognise the danger of these medicinal trials. They had no choice but to accept all the pain as well as their miserable fate.Shi Yan knew that none of these slaves would make it. Sooner or later, they were going to die. Maybe tomorrow, or maybe later. He knew he was powerless to change all this. Therefore, he avoided contact with these slaves, thus avoiding any hurtful feelings when they died.Shi Yan frowned as he took a quick glimpse at Master Karu sitting in the sedan atop the ground dragon, trying his best not to be discovered.There were five White Medicine Bottles embroidered on Master Karu\u2019s chest, which meant that he was a Level-5 Mortality alchemist. In the Grace Mainland, an alchemist was even more distinguished and rare than a Warrior.Every alchemist had to be a Warrior. The medicine they refined could help enhance a warrior\u2019s capability. There were special pills refined by a small number of extraordinary alchemists which could even enhance a warrior\u2019s Martial Spirit.Compared to the 10 levels among warriors, the ranking of alchemists were based on their expertise in the field of medicine. There were five categories of alchemists in the Grace Mainland; Mortality, Mystery, Soul, Royalty, and Divinity[3]. Under each category, there were seven sub-ranks.Every alchemist would carry a special token corresponding to his ranking. Alchemists of the Mortality Category would be embroidered with White Medicine Bottles on their chests. Mystery Category \u2013 Red Flames; Soul Category \u2013 Medicinal Herbs; Royalty Category \u2013 Wonder Pills; and Divinity Category \u2013 Medicinal Cauldron. There were five White Medicine Bottles on Master Karu\u2019s chest, so it was clear that he had the expertise of a Level-5 Mortality alchemist.Since the medicine provided by alchemists could enhance the Profound Qi inside a Warrior, this small group of people held a prestigious status among all warriors. Due to the low number of alchemists, every group were desperate to hire a good alchemist, which made the alchemists even more revered and exceptional.As a Level-5 Mortality alchemist, Master Karu was invited by Mo Yanyu from Medicine Valley within the God-blessed Empire. Like the Shi family, the Mo family were also one of the five distinguished families of the Merchant Union. The Mo family were famous for their own Martial Spirit which had the power of lightning. A lot of people from the Mo family were naturally born with the Lightning Martial Spirit, which would improve with the growth of their own skills.Mo Yanyu was from the youngest generation of warriors born with the Lightning Martial Spirit from the Mo family.The Mo family were working in the medicine business within the Merchant Union. They never stopped searching for great alchemists for their own use, no matter where these alchemists came from. However, most alchemists had quirky personalities and had weird demands. Above all, they were the haughtiest people on Earth and held very high opinions of themselves. Therefore, very few of them would accept the influence of powerful families like the Mo family, and thus the Mo family had tasted more failure than success when recruiting these alchemists.Although Master Karu was merely a Level-5 Mortality alchemist, the Mo family had exhausted every means to convince him. Nobody knew what Mo Yanyu had offered this time in order to persuade Master Karu to leave Medicine Valley and come and work for them.However, Master Karu was not the type of person who was fond of the orthodox. He was more interested in crooked ways of applying his skills to make poisons. However, the production of the finest poisons required a huge amount of medicinal trials, and the subject must be a living, breathing human. This was why these medicine slaves existed.\u201cLet\u2019s move!\u201d With Mo Yanyu\u2019s order from the distance, the resting warriors all stood up and got ready for the march ahead. The medicine slaves resting on the road side also quickly got up, for fear of the punishment they would face if they didn\u2019t manage to keep up.Shi Yan stood up, still and silent. He took a sniff at the woman who had the appearance of an angel but the heart of a scorpion. He had no choice but to follow the group before him obediently.In the Merchant Union, the relationship between the Mo family and the Shi family was not that smooth. The fifth uncle of Mo Yanyu was killed by Shi Yang three years ago due to a dispute over the mining rights at a mountain. After that, the Mo family started a relentless vendetta against the Shi family, causing the death of dozens of Shi family members. With this kind of hatred rooted between these two families, there were endless conflicts and fights going on.Shi Yan understood that death would be his fate if his true identity was ever discovered.But luckily the original owner of his body kept a low profile. He was not endowed with a Martial Spirit, didn\u2019t take much interest in the martial fights, and barely showed up to any martial activities organized by the Merchant Union. Therefore, there was no way that Mo Yanyu would ever recognize him. Otherwise, Shi Yan wouldn\u2019t have been this lucky.As night fell, the moon was like a silver plate floating in the dark sky, accompanied by several sparkling stars.The Mo family troop was camping and resting by the river. The ground dragon was resting quietly with only the sound of its heavy breathing permeating the air. The Mo family warriors were gorging themselves on dried meat and laughing aloud in a perverted way, exchanging gossip about some notorious whores in a Merchant Union\u2019s brothel.When Mo Yanyu was not looking, a few audacious warriors would gaze at her sexy body in secret, lusting after her body. They knew that for people of their level, Mo Yanyu was way out of their league. All they could do was fantasize.Shi Yan sat down in silence. When he was ready to circulate the Profound Qi inside his body, he noticed Mo Yanyu and Master Karu coming towards him from the front of the troops.\u201cShit!\u201d Shi Yan felt that something bad was going to happen. His face suddenly looked like hell.\u201cThe Gut Cutting poison is way too strong for normal people. It has already killed six slaves within the past two days. I guess only Warriors can sustain its influence. That boy looks better than before, with much of his Profound Qi recovered, he can be our new lab rat.\u201d Master Karu said with a viperous smile on his face and a bowl of some black sticky liquid in his left hand.\u201cWell, Master Karu, please. Help yourself. He is all yours. Don\u2019t show any mercy. I want him to die as miserably as possible.\u201d Mo Yanyu also laughed.\u201cHaha, no problem. Miss Mo, your wish is my command. I promise you that there is no way he will die easy. As you have seen in the previous trials of the Gut Cutting poison, all the slaves died with their flesh and skin slowly decaying off their bones bit by bit. This boy looks tough. The stronger the subject is, the longer and more painful this decaying process will be. Just wait for the grand show and enjoy!\u201d Master Karu burst into wild laughter, as if Shi Yan were not standing right in front of him.\u201cThat is perfect!\u201d Mo Yanyu smiled in consent. Her eyes were obviously shining with excitement, her hatred of Shi Yan churning in her gut.It was only a matter of time before the two of them finally arrived in front of Shi Yan. Master Karu didn\u2019t even bother to explain. He handed the bowl of black sticky liquid to Shi Yan and ordered with a cold voice, \u201cYou, finish this!\u201dWhile Mo Yanyu took out her left hand, generating a snake of electric power circling around her fingers; her skin like porcelain and the electric power sparking like lightning. This was the perfect combination of the Lightning Martial Spirit and Profound Qi. The energy was like a catalyst in the air with sound of small explosions all around.\u201cWoo-hoo!\u201d Johnson sneered from behind, \u201cBoy! If you ever dare to resist, you know what\u2019s gonna happen to you, right?\u201dMaster Karu couldn\u2019t contain his excitement. He clapped his hands, and shouted, \u201cHey boy, the Gut Cutting Medicine is lots of fun. You are going to decay from the inside, little by little\u2026\u201dThe whole time, Mo Yanyu was staring at Shi Yan with an icy expression on her face. She assumed that he would say no. Her plan was, as soon as Shi Yan showed any disobedience, she would kick his ass with the electric sparks on her fingers, showing him who was the boss here.For days, every time she looked back on the humiliation she received from this man, she couldn\u2019t help but rage inside. Even her fianc\u00e9e wouldn\u2019t dare to do that to her. Who the hell was this guy? How dare he?! She would never forgive this guy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSure.

    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6 \u2013 Immortal Martial SpiritAs the Gut Cutting poison went down into his stomach, Shi Yan could feel a dull pain spreading inside. Then his gut and stomach was corroded little by little as if he drank sulphuric acid, and the pain inside his body gradually grew stronger.\u201cThis Gut Cutting poison is potent. It doesn\u2019t show its effects all at once, but releases its power gradually. A normal person will be corroded by it in two to three days and they will die with a decayed body.\u201d Karu narrowed his eyes and added, \u201cNo hurry, let\u2019s wait for a day and see.\u201d\u201cGood. We will check on him at this time tomorrow night.\u201d Mo Yanyu nodded. She glanced at Shi Yan in satisfaction, and left with Karu happily.\u201cHehe. Fellow, your good days have come to an end!\u201d Johnson laughed loudly, showing his teeth. He suddenly felt quite relaxed when he thought that Shi Yan would die in no time, and a heavy burden dropped from his heart.Shi Yan lowered his head with an icy glint in his eyes.The Gut Cutting poison began to take effect in his stomach and gut, which Shi Yan could sense clearly. It felt like tens of millions of ants were nibbling at his stomach and gut in order to compete for territory.The Profound Qi in the lower part of his belly circulated quickly into the gut and stomach. It was like a gentle stream quietly washing away the drug under Shi Yan\u2019s control. Wherever the Profound Qi went, it made the drug effects milder, thus Shi Yan became a little relieved.As a moist breeze blew softly, Shi Yan took a large deep breath. He sat down where he was, not paying any attention to Johnson beside him, and concentrated his mind to guide the Profound Qi to fight against the drug.The Profound Qi, which had been growing much stronger recently, became Shi Yan\u2019s life-saver. It kept moving in his stomach and guts. Every time it made a circle, the effects of the drug was softened a little, and his body was not corroded any faster.At that moment, Shi Yan realized what benefits Profound Qi could bring, and was determined to train hard to be a top warrior with strong Profound Qi.If Profound Qi could bring such great benefits, how much more powerful would a god-blessed Martial Spirit be. If I could possess Martial Spirit I could definitely be much stronger and would feel less pain.For a moment, Shi Yan regretted that the owner of his body didn\u2019t inherit the Petrification Martial Spirit of the Shi Family, or he could have plucked up his courage and fought against Mo Yanyu. Maybe he could have won against her Lightning with Petrification and escaped without being made into a guinea pig.Time passed by and soon it was late at night, the moonlight bathing the land in its silver light. The warriors became quiet since it was an exhausting day of marching. They found a comfortable place and sat down respectively, training their Profound Qi in order to break through the limits of their bodies and entering higher levels and gaining stronger power.The medicine slaves looked up at the dark sky one by one. In the silent night, they tended to become homesick and scared. They would be filled with hopelessness whenever they thought about the fact that they could be a dead body the following day after the next medicinal trial.Under the pale moonlight, Shi Yan sat cross-legged on the ground, a dignified expression appearing on his serene face.After five hours of circulation, the Profound Qi had prevented the gut cutting medicine from rapidly diffusing. Nonetheless, unknowingly, he realized that his Profound Qi had been consumed by one third, and was continuously being depleted.But the Gut Cutting poison didn\u2019t seem to fade, on the contrary, it was still quite potent.The gut cutting medicine was waiting for the Profound Qi to run up and it could fight back.Shi Yan suddenly felt a severe cold shiver all over his body.Once his Profound Qi had dried up, he would have nothing to protect himself with. Then, like most commoners, his body would starting decaying from the inside out. He couldn\u2019t do anything about it!He could do nothing!But in this situation, he couldn\u2019t gain more Profound Qi by training. Once he took away the Profound Qi in his stomach and gut, the Gut Cutting poison would gain strength and made him die faster.Thus he could do nothing but wait for it to happen, even if it meant death.Two more hours passed by.The effects of the Gut Cutting poison didn\u2019t weaken, but increased continuously. He could clearly feel his Profound Qi was depleting faster and faster!He felt that he was getting closer to deaths door\u2026Once his Profound Qi ran out, his insides would corrode, but he wouldn\u2019t die quickly. The corrosion would spread throughout his body, and in five or six days, he would decayed and die, just like every other medicine slave.Shi Yan was unyielding. With a cold glare, he stared at Mo Yanyu who was sitting on an old tree far away.Under the bright moonlight, Mo Yanyu sat upright on a thick tree with a serene face. Her skin was like frost, while her long hair swayed with the wind. A spirit in the dark night! She didn\u2019t notice Shi Yan\u2019s cold eyes as she was whole-hearted training and nourishing the vessel which contained her Lightning Martial Spirit with Profound Qi.Master Karu was at the end of the troops. He stood against another ancient tree and was carefully reading a book about poison in his right hand, his left hand in his cuff.Now and then, he looked in the direction of Shi Yan with a slippery smirk in the corner of his mouth.\u201cI can\u2019t let it go like this.\u201d Shi Yan thought with knitted brows. He operated the Profound Qi and at the same time pondered on the ways to solve his dilemma.If it went on like this, his Profound Qi would dry up before dawn and he would die without any doubt! He couldn\u2019t change anything even if he ran away, for the drug was in his body. The only solution was Master Karu!He invented the Gut Cutting poison, thus he must have the cure for it. He could change his destiny of a decaying death only by getting that cure from Master Karu. Yet Master Karu was not only an alchemist, but also a Warrior of the Nascent realm. It was suicide if he tried to grab the cure from him.Shi Yan observed him for a while. He found that although Master Karu was reading, he was also looking in his direction every now and then. Apparently, he was not against taking precautions. He might have even figured out what Shi Yan would do and was waiting for him to take action.Several ideas flashed through his mind. Shi Yan knew that there was almost no possibility that he could succeed. Yet he had to turn to Master Karu and take action soon. Because it would become impossible to survive if his Profound Qi ran out.Shi Yan adjusted his breath secretly and despite the poison in the stomach, he drew the Profound Qi back and prepared to fight.As expected, the Gut Cutting poison became stronger and spread faster after the Profound Qi was drawn back. He was attacked by a wave of agony throughout his body.Just as Shi Yan was about to attack, he felt a sudden change in the corroded part of his gut!The cells there came back to life! A weak power wove through the corroded areas as if an invisible hand was sewing up his gut and stomach.Shi Yan was stunned.Although he was fully prepared, he didn\u2019t rush out irrationally. He quickly calmed down and concentrated on observing the changes inside of his body.His cells were full of life, while the rotten flesh twitched slightly and recovered gradually. After half an hour, the rotten parts had recovered and the pain had disappeared.A bolt flashed through Shi Yan\u2019s body and he was ecstatic in his heart. However, his face still looked as calm as a lake, as if he was deep asleep.Every ability that could operate without Profound Qi must be a special Martial Spirit!The description of a Martial spirit dawned on Shi Yan at that time. Pondering on it for a while, Shi Yan was assured that it was a special Martial Spirit that brought about the changes to his body.Self-recovery of the body is a special ability, which hadn\u2019t been discovered by people!The Gut Cutting poison took effect again. Without Profound Qi as his defence, Shi Yan\u2019s insides started to rot again.But magically, it happened again! With his cells full of life, the rotten part recovered in a short period of time!The effect of the drug broke out continuously and corroded his insides many times. But every time, the self-recovery Martial Spirit activated and cured it before next round of corrosion.A Martial Spirit increased in strength as the level of the Warrior increased, and sometimes it might undergo a special change. The higher the level of a Warrior, the stronger the abilities their Martial Spirit showed.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnother definition of a Martial Spirit appeared in his mind. Shi Yan was overjoyed. According to the ability of the self-recovery Martial Spirit, his self-recovery ability would increase as his level increased. Maybe when he reaches the Sky and Spirit realm, he could even cure broken limbs with the self-recovery Martial Spirit.If he could do that, maybe he could recover from a stab to the heart and survive?If that happened, once he reached the True God realm, maybe he would be immortal?A lot of ideas crossed his mind. After careful thinking, Shi Yan named this Martial Spirit the Immortal Martial Spirit.After observing for a while, he was certain the Immortal Martial Spirit could block the Gut Cutting poison. Shi Yan set his mind at ease and paused his plan of getting the cure from Master Karu. He sat where he was and began to recover his Profound Qi, regardless of the battle in his gut and stomach.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7 \u2013 The Second SkyThe next morning before the sun rose, with a layer of fog still around, the troops had already gotten ready for the path ahead.Shi Yan was mingling among the medicine slaves, maintaining a calm expression and behaving as normal. As usual, he marched in silence with the troop. Johnson was very surprised to see Shi Yan so calm and peaceful. He was wondering when Shi Yan was going to go belly up like the other medicine slaves before him.In the past few days, every single one of those medicine slaves who took the Gut Cutting poison would wake up with a pale face and a weak body the next morning, with no exception. For the weak ones, they could barely walk, for the strong ones, you could clearly see the pain and terror on their faces.However, Shi Yan was still walking. His face looked healthy with a rosy color in his cheeks. He didn\u2019t look like he was in pain at all, which made Johnson very confused and curious.Johnson stared at Shi Yan for a while. After he made sure that Shi Yan was indeed healthy, Johnson came to the front of the marching troops with a frown. He reported Shi Yan\u2019s strange status to Mo Yanyu and Master Karu.\u201cDon\u2019t panic.\u201d Master Karu was very confident of his medicine, \u201cThat boy is a Warrior. He is pretty tough and not that easy to break down. Just wait till the Profound Qi inside him is depleted. He will be no different from those slaves. I know my Gut Cutting poison very well.\u201d\u201cOK. You go back there and keep an eye on him.\u201d Mo Yanyu said with an expressionless face.Since the two of them were so calm about this news, Johnson had no choice but to obey. He didn\u2019t insist any more. He went back to the back of the troop and continued to monitor every movement of Shi Yan closely as he was told.\u201cMaster Karu, how long should it take for that bastard to start suffering?\u201d After Johnson left, Mo Yanyu started to look worried. The result she was expecting is for Shi Yan to start dying from hellish pain now. The more suffering Shi Yan felt, the more pleasure she would be able to enjoy.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. It is about time.\u201dAfter the end of the day, the moon replaced the sun and rose in the sky.After the troop had settled, Master Karu and Mo Yanyu over walked to Shi Yan together. They saw Shi Yan sitting on the ground, stuffing himself with some scraps of food.\u201cMaster Karu, that guy doesn\u2019t look quite\u2026\u201d Mo Yanyu said in hesitation. The way Shi Yan was engorging himself in his food was not that decent, but he didn\u2019t look to be in pain at all.Master Karu was apparently offended, \u201cWhat? Are you questioning my skills as an alchemist?\u201d\u201cNo, no.\u201d Mo Yanyu said, \u201cThe power of the Gut Cutting poison has already been proven on other medicine slaves. I was just wondering why this guy could survive. Did you forget any ingredients in his dose?\u201d\u201cMiss Mo, although I am not a top alchemist, I couldn\u2019t have made such a ridiculous mistake.\u201d Master Karu was apparently offended. He said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe in my ability, I can leave right now.\u201d\u201cMaster Karu, please don\u2019t. That\u2019s not what I meant. I was just wondering why the medicine did not work on him. I didn\u2019t mean anything else.\u201d Mo Yanyu looked panicked.\u201cHmm!\u201d Master Karu didn\u2019t even bother to reply. He rose up from the ground, and flew right towards Shi Yan as fast as lightning.Shi Yan kept his head down and pretended he wasn\u2019t paying attention. However, deep down he was surprised at the speed Master Karu was moving. He felt lucky that he didn\u2019t try to fight against him yesterday. Otherwise, he would have definitely suffered.Apart from being an alchemist, Master Karu was also a Warrior of the Nascent Realm. However, Shi Yan was just a Warrior of the Elementary Realm, who only made it to the Second Sky and could barely operate the Profound Qi inside his body. There was a huge difference between the two of them and there was no chance Shi Yan would survive a fight with Master Karu. If he ever fought back, he would be asking for death.\u201cfwoosh!\u201dWith a strange sound in the sky, it only took seconds before Master Karu arrived in front of Shi Yan.Shi Yan put down the food in his hands and looked up at Master Karu.Master Karu had a skinny, stone-cold face. He suddenly grabbed Shi Yan\u2019s left arm with lightning speed, put his fingers on Shi Yan\u2019s skin, and quickly inserted his electric-type Profound Qi into his veins. His Profound Qi flowed into Shi Yan\u2019s body, circled around his entire system, and returned to Master Karu\u2019s fingers.The Profound Qi of Master Karu was so strong that Shi Yan felt a little overwhelmed with just the circulation of his Profound Qi, with all his veins aching and burning.\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d Master Karu frowned with doubt. He said in a low voice, \u201cIt cannot be. The Gut Cutting poison is apparently still inside his body. Why is there still Profound Qi remaining in his body? His gut is not corroded either. He is just a low-level Warrior. He cannot have such fine Profound Qi. He shouldn\u2019t be breathing right now.\u201dShi Yan just let him grab his arm and didn\u2019t fight back.\u201cMaster Karu, how does he look?\u201d Mo Yanyu also arrived.\u201cJust wait for one more day.\u201d Master Karu said with a cold look. He couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on either because he had never considered a Martial Spirit. For an ordinary Warrior like him, there\u2019s no way he could possess a Martial Spirit. Moreover, Master Karu had never heard of any Martial Spirit that could heal one\u2019s body.Although Mo Yanyu also had a million questions, she had no choice but to nod in agreement. She didn\u2019t say anything, but stared at Shi Yan for a while with a strange look. Shi Yan guessed that she was planning something awful for him again.The next night, Master Karu and Mo Yanyu came over to check Shi Yan\u2019s body again. They found that Shi Yan was still fine, no decay, everything was healthy. Master Karu looked more embarrassed than yesterday and told Mo Yanyu to wait for one more day.The next night, when the two of them checked again, still nothing.On the fourth night, Master Karu came again. This time, he had two bowls of Gut Cutting poison in his hands. When he arrived, he ordered Johnson to bring another medicine slave called Kuro over to Shi Yan. He commanded the two of them to finish the two bowls of Gut Cutting poison that he had just made.Again, Shi Yan drank it obediently.\u201cI made these two bowls of Gut Cutting poison with the same ingredients.\u201d Master Karu added after the two of them had finished their bowl of Gut Cutting poison.Mo Yanyu said with agreement, \u201cIf that Kuro\u2019s body starts to corrode, it means there\u2019s something wrong with this guy\u2019s body. I understand you now.\u201d\u201cYes exactly,\u201d Master Karu nodded, \u201cJust come over again tomorrow night at the same time, and then we will see.\u201dAt night, Shi Yan sat on the ground, slowly operating the Profound Qi inside his body with a heavy look on his face.The Profound Qi was slowing stretching in his body. It became longer and longer and gradually expanded throughout his veins. With a thought, the Profound Qi gradually became extremely flexible, flowing from one vein to another. As long as he was giving it a command in his mind, the Profound Qi would move all around his veins, just like a snake.Gradually, the Profound Qi moved to the index finger of his right hand through the veins in his arm. Shi Yan concentrated and moved the Profound Qi back into his veins in the arm. Suddenly, his Profound Qi speed up and rushed towards his right index finger with an unstoppable force, faster and faster.\u201cShoo!\u201dThere was a strange sound on the tip of his right index finger. With an intense pain, the Profound Qi forced itself into his index finger. Shi Yan\u2019s finger couldn\u2019t help trembling just like the tail of a rattlesnake.The Profound Qi was now concentrated in his index finger, expanding and pushing around, but couldn\u2019t break through the skin on the outside. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn\u2019t manage to make the Profound Qi break the skin and leave his body.\u201cWhoo!\u201d Shi Yan breathed heavily, and gathered his Profound Qi back into his abdomen, looking pretty disappointed. \u201cI failed again\u2026\u201d He said in a very low voice to himself.There were three stages to the Elementary Realm[1]. If you could cultivate Profound Qi, you would have reached the First Sky. If you were able to operate your Profound Qi skillfully and make it circulate through your body with your mind, you would have reached the Second Sky. If you managed to make your Profound Qi break out of your skin and into the air, that was the Third Sky.Now that Shi Yan was able to operate his Profound Qi skillfully all over his body, he had reached the Second Sky. In past few days, he had been collecting and concentrating more and more Profound Qi, trying to force it out of his fingers, hoping to reach the Third Sky. He had tried many times. However, so far he failed to break the boundary of his skin.\u201cIt seems that the training of a Warrior cannot be achieved overnight. My Profound Qi is still not strong enough. Maybe I should try again later after I collect and refine more Profound Qi.\u201d After another failure, Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help but sigh. Maybe it\u2019s due to his dangerous situation, he seemed a little hasty.He knew that by this time tomorrow, his body would still be the same, unaffected by the Gut Cutting poison. However, that slave called Kuro wouldn\u2019t be this lucky. His gut would have already been decayed together with his other organs.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs soon as Master Karu saw this, he would instantly figure out that there\u2019s nothing wrong with his poison, but the problem was lying inside Shi Yan\u2019s body. He would know that Shi Yan\u2019s body was different from the others, and this is exactly where the trouble would begin. There wouldn\u2019t be easy life for him from then on. Probably Mo Yanyu would just kill him in case he created some new problems in the future.He wouldn\u2019t even wait until tomorrow morning. If Kuro started to show symptoms tomorrow morning, Shi Yan\u2019s secret would have been discovered instantly. By that time, all the Warriors would have been up and would all be paying attention to him. He would have no chance to escape.Looking at the night sky full of bright stars, Shi Yan\u2019s face became more serious and determined. He knew that if he ever wanted to survive, he must escape tonight!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-[1] Elementary Realm: the first level of warriors.

Mo Yanyu hid herself amongst the foliage of a huge ancient tree, taking long breaths. Master Karu stood against another tree, reading a volume of his poison encyclopedia joyfully. Medicine slaves were lying disorderly on the wet ground behind the Ground Dragon.Shi Yan woke up from training and observed his surroundings quietly in a calculatingly manner.Mo Yanyu was at the head of the troops while Master Karu at the rear. The two seemed to not care about Shi Yan, however their position gave them away. Apparently they were both on guard against Shi Yan who was in the centre of the troops.Johnson seemed to know that Shi Yan would make his move tonight, so he didn\u2019t train, instead he focused on Shi Yan who was ten metres away. Once Shi Yan made a move, he would notice it and stop him.\u201cToo bad.\u201d Shi Yan thought to himself. He waited for them to let their guard down.As time passed, the bright moon disappeared. Dawn was about to arrive. However, Shi Yan hadn\u2019t gotten a chance to escape yet, so he was a little anxious. After a moment\u2019s hesitation, he decided not to wait and was about to take action.\u201cKaka! Kakaka!\u201dAt that moment, a strange sound came from afar. Something was heading in this direction slowly.As the Profound Qi flew forth and back in his arms, Shi Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly shone with excitement.\u201cEveryone on alert!\u201d Mo Yanyu shouted, when she lifted herself up from the ancient tree. Staying in a high position, she looked into the distance for a while, then screamed, \u201cA Jade Blade Spider!\u201dAll the warriors woke up from their training process.The warriors were all wearing a rigid face. Before Mo Yanyu uttered anything, they took out their weapons and crowded around the Ground Dragon in a circle, five or six metres away from each other.Master Karu packed the book away and frowned. He walked up to the Ground Dragon and ordered in a low voice, \u201cKeep an eye on the medicine bottles on the dragon!\u201d\u201cYes Master Karu!\u201d The warriors responded in unison.The medicine slaves woke up one by one. Hearing a Jade Blade Spider was nearing, they were all frightened and ran to the ground dragon. Apparently, they all knew how cruel a Jade Blade Spider was.\u201cJingle!\u201dA bunch of keys flew out from Mo Yanyu\u2019s hand to land under Johnson\u2019s foot. \u201cJohnson, open the shackles on them! Or they will be killed by the spider! Hurry up!\u201d Mo Yanyu urged.Johnson picked up the keys and looked up at Mo Yanyu, then pointed to Shi Yan, \u201cIncluding him?\u201d\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t want him to die easily.\u201d Mo Yanyu showed no patience on her face.\u201cKid, be well-behaved. I will keep an eye on you!\u201d Johnson snorted. He released the shackles on Shi Yan first, then walked over to the rest slaves and freed them one after another.\u201cThank God!\u201dAs the shackles were released, Shi Yan felt extremely relaxed and smirked in his mind.The Shi family was an aristocratic family with a Martial Spirit. Although the owner of this body wasn\u2019t a Warrior, he loved adventures and searching for historic remains immensely. He was also familiar with all sorts of demon beasts. So when Mo Yanyu mentioned the Jade Blade Spider, Shi Yan was extremely happy as he knew his chance to escape was coming!The Jade Blade Spider was a Level 2 demon beast whose eight legs were as sharp as knives. They liked to wander at night and always appeared in groups of five or six. The spiders were cruel and loved eating humans. Once they came across humans in the Dark Forest, they would never spare them.Demon beasts were always much larger than humans. They had thick, coarse skin and could move faster than humans. Commoners would either die or be injured whenever they met one. Only skilled warriors could escape. Although the Jade Blade Spiders were a mere Level 2 demon beast, they made their appearance in groups of five or six, and normal warriors couldn\u2019t move faster than them, thus it was hard to compete with them.To meet Jade Blade Spiders in the Dark Forest was a bad situation for anyone, as there was nothing valuable on its body and they were aggressive and moved like the wind. They would start attacking as soon as they saw a human and would never leave without getting something, even ignoring their injuries.Shi Yan approached the Ground Dragon quietly and stood by the panicking medicine slaves and started to observe what was happening, not in a hurry to escape.\u201cShit! Eight of them!\u201dMo Yanyu cried from the tree, frowning with a rigid face. \u201cIt will be a nasty fight. Get ready! Remember, do not pursue and attack! The spiders will have the advantage if we retreat into the thickets! Do not fight in the there!\u201d\u201cKakaka! Kaka!\u201dThe sound of a knife cutting the earth approached. Soon, they saw two Jade Blade Spiders who were 10 metres long and 1.5 metres tall. The whole body of the Spider was snow white and as large as a bus, with eight legs like daggers; bright and sharp.The Spiders moved their dagger-like legs and advanced in extremely quickly and nimbly. They arrived in an instant. Their legs reflected an icy light while moving and easily scared everyone. It was not hard to imagine what tragedy would happen once one was cut by those legs.Seeing the Spiders show up one by one, the warriors were all silent. Mo Yanyu had jumped down from the tree minutes ago. She was standing in the front of the troops, getting ready by inter-twining her fingers with radiant lightning. Master Karu sat relaxed in the sedan atop the Ground Dragon with indifferent eyes, not showing any indication of fear.Soon, all eight spiders appeared. They were not stupid, as they separated and surrounded the Ground Dragon, and then shooting forth like eight cars.With a harsh whistling sound, the eight spiders started the battle at the same time. White legs were raised up into the vast sky, they flew forward at the same time, rushing towards the warriors who were around the Ground Dragon.At that moment, the air was filled with silver and white knives. The warriors reacted quickly. They thrust their weapons, while deflecting the spiders\u2019 attack, towards the beasts\u2019 waist and eyes.Everything descended into chaos.The Jade Blade Spiders surrounded the Ground Dragon. White legs crashed down. Warriors dodged to the left and the right, and kept thrusting their weapons. Mo Yanyu broke out her Martial Spirit. Her hands were twined by lightning and kept radiating [Verdant Crescent Slashes], which fell upon the spiders and left them trembling.\u201cShooo!\u201dOne of the warriors sustained a cut on his torso by a spider leg before he could react. His organs spilled out of him along with his desperate cry. He then fell heavily onto the ground.The medicine slaves were so frightened that they couldn\u2019t help themselves and hid beneath the Ground Dragon. Some slaves lost their mind. They ran in between the spider legs in order to escape, but were nailed to the ground by the spiders\u2019 legs and died instantly.Shi Yan contained himself, his eyes filled with a strange light. He almost didn\u2019t move behind the warriors, the shackles ringing with clear sounds.\u201cCrack!\u201dThe warrior in front of Shi Yan, who was of the Second Sky of the Elementary Realm, bumped into another warrior while moving. Before he could evade, a spider leg cut through his neck and his head was sent flying. Shi Yan was showered with his blood.Shi Yan\u2019s eyes were blurred by the blood. Suddenly, a desire of slaughter broke out in his body. The cyclones in his seven hundred and twenty meridians swirled madly while a potent strength welled out of the meridians.The headless body of the warrior was spurting out blood. An air current, which could only be sensed by Shi Yan, which was filled with despair, anger and regret, seeped into every pore on Shi Yan. It flowed along his veins until it reached all of the seven hundred and twenty meridians.In a trance, Shi Yan felt as if he was back at the blood pool again, where he had absorbed all that blood into his meridians as well. The blood had changed his meridians, produced cyclones, and enlarged their capacity, which accelerated the speed it could absorb the blood.This time, the wisps of air, combined with the despair and hatred of the dead warrior, entered into his body the same way, from the veins to the meridians, in a very rapid speed. The cyclones in his meridians spun hard as if digesting the air currents. Too nefarious!In ten or so seconds, the air current stopped entering his body. The dead body of the warrior had dried up, as if the blood and Profound Qi were all sucked out of it. Like a dry mummy!The desire to slaughter emerged in Shi Yan\u2019s heart. When the seven hundred and twenty meridians spun in his body, the power of despair, fear and cruelty multiplied as well, which urged Shi Yan to begin a massacre.\u201cShwish!\u201dA spider leg flew towards Shi Yan\u2019s head. Surprised, Shi Yan controlled his urge to kill and moved behind another warrior to escape the strike.\u201cChee!\u201dThat warrior was blocked by the spider, when he thrust his weapon into the spider\u2019s eye with all of his strength. The blind spider went insane and brandished its leg, cutting into the warrior\u2019s waist. The warrior was cut into two pieces and died quickly.After moving near the warrior, when Shi Yan was just about to find a safe zone, things changed again!The absorption power of his meridians erupted again! The air currents of rage and regret from the two pieces of the warrior\u2019s body insanely rushed into his vein and meridians.In an instant, that warrior became mummified too.Shi Yan was dumbstruck.Without a second thought, he assumed that there was another Martial Spirit hidden in his body. This Martial Spirit was based on his meridians and was able to absorb a dead body\u2019s power. Shi Yan was frightened by this evil Martial Spirit.Just then!A Jade Blade Spider let out a strange whistle, and the remaining six spiders flew back into the thick forest quickly.Apparently they had noticed that it would be hard to fight with this troop. After two of them died, they finally withdrew.Shi Yan\u2019s face turned cold. He stopped thinking about that weird Martial Spirit at once and moved all of his Profound Qi into his feet. He dashed out with those Jade Blade Spiders as fast as a whirlwind.He could only run away among the spiders.Suddenly a warm stream welled out of the meridians and into the Profound Qi inside Shi Yan. His thin Qi was twice strong as before!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Yan thus gained more confidence and went into a state of ecstasy. He looked back to Mo Yanyu afar, running along with the spiders. He said coldly: \u201cMo Yanyu, wait and see, I will fuck you one day!\u201d\u201cCatch him!\u201d Mo Yanyu\u2019s slim body trembled, her eyes on fire, as she chased after Shi Yan.Master Karu was even faster!The vicious alchemist kept quiet on the Ground Dragon as if waiting for something. When Shi Yan ran away with the spiders, he jumped up and flew high after Shi Yan like an eagle.\u201cKid, I\u2019ve waited for so long.\u201d Master Karu smirked in an evil voice while he was still up in the sky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The power and strength of a Nascent Realm Warrior was far beyond that of an ordinary Elementary Realm Warrior.Mo Yanyu also chased after him with a killing intent in her beautiful eyes, leaving her own troops behind. She swore to catch Shi Yan and kill him as soon as she got her hands on him.Shi Yan\u2019s face turned serious. He concentrated all the Profound Qi inside his body into the veins in his legs. Every time he took a step on the hard ground, his skinny body would fly forward for seven or eight meters. Soon he was closing in on the giant Jade Blade Spiders.\u201cKa! Ka! Ka!\u201dThe Jade Blade Spiders were moving in the wetland with all their eight legs plugged into the mud. Soon they disappeared into the thicket.Shi Yan followed them into the thick bushes which were 5-6 meters tall. His face was getting more and more nervous. He already forgot how terrifying the Jade Blade Spiders were and kept staring at one of the spiders at front.Once they got into the bushes, the Jade Blade Spiders suddenly slowed down. Two Jade Blade Spiders suddenly turned around with a strange light in their eyes. They seemed to be annoyed at being chased all the way into the bushes.The Jade Blade Spiders didn\u2019t know Shi Yan\u2019s intention. Being chased by three humans, they probably thought that they wanted to fight. One of the Jade Blade Spiders screamed with a strangely sharp sound. Suddenly, the four other Jade Blade Spiders all turned around and looked straight at Shi Yan.Shi Yan still remained calm. He didn\u2019t slow down at all, but streaked towards the Jade Blade Spiders with a much higher speed.Shi Yan was more focused than ever. His mind became as clear as a mirror. Suddenly, he had entered that marvellous stage again. Everything around him became so clear to him. He could even hear the low-frequency communication among the Jade Blade Spiders, as well as the fast movements of Master Karu behind him. He couldn\u2019t miss anything.\u201cWhoo!\u201dWith Shi Yan\u2019s fast movements, the air around him was split in half and he soon generated a strong wind around him. He could hear the sound of air flow louder and louder next to his ears.Just as Shi Yan had almost run into those Jade Blade Spiders, he suddenly changed direction in the air and flew past one of the Jade Blade Spiders by a millimeter. It was so close that he almost got nicked by the spider\u2019s blade-like legs. Shi Yan soon passed by the group of Jade Blade Spiders and continued running forward with no hesitation.The Jade Blade Spiders were seriously provoked and irritated.The six Jade Blade Spiders felt like they were fooled by this man in front of them. They had never felt so humiliated. With a sharp scream, the six spiders started racing towards Shi Yan.Master Karu and Mo Yanyu ran into the bushes one after another, but they had lost track of Shi Yan and only saw the six raging Jade Blade Spiders.Master Karu suddenly stopped chasing, and said with an icy light in his eyes, \u201cThat boy must have hidden somewhere in these bushes.\u201d\u201cMaybe he has run through the flock of Jade Blade Spiders and is ahead of them right now?\u201d Mo Yanyu asked with a frown and some uncertainty in her voice.Master Karu sniffed, \u201cEven if he is bold enough, he couldn\u2019t have survived the Jade Blade Spiders. The eight spider legs are like meat grinders. This place is the proprietary land of the Jade Blade Spiders. If he did become the target of those spiders, he would have already been killed without a doubt.\u201d\u201cYeah, that makes sense.\u201d Mo Yanyu agreed with Master Karu. The two of them then split up and started to search the bushes for traces of Shi Yan.On the other side, Shi Yan was crazily looking for his way out of the bushes in this dark forest. He was running as fast as he could, but so were those six Jade Blade Spiders behind him. Soon the spiders were closing in on him.In this part of the Dark Forest, there were no tall trees, nothing but low bushes which seemed to be continue on forever. Shi Yan couldn\u2019t see the end of them. The bushes were not that strong, and were easily destroyed simply by a scratch of the spider\u2019s legs.Therefore, Shi Yan couldn\u2019t find a tree to hide or rest. All he could do was to keep running like hell. He really hoped he could get rid of those Jade Blade Spiders behind him.Luckily for him, there was a magical energy spilling out from his Meridians which flowed into his veins and mixed with his Profound Qi. His Profound Qi was therefore much stronger and more concentrated than ever. Otherwise, he couldn\u2019t have possibly kept up this pace for so long, and probably would have been slaughtered by those fearsome Jade Blade Spiders and their sharp legs.With the strong movements of the Profound Qi inside the veins in his legs, Shi Yan felt like they were full of power. Every time he stepped hard on the ground, he would fly up as light as a feather and flew several meters forward. Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help admiring the amazing power of Profound Qi and was more and more determined to become a great Warrior.Shi Yan couldn\u2019t remember how long he had been running for his life, but now he was really exhausted. After such long time running, he could feel the power of the Profound Qi inside his legs declining sharply, and he was not running as fast as before.As he slowed down, the Jade Blade Spiders didn\u2019t. These demon beasts had one of the strongest physiques. They didn\u2019t need the support of any extra energy to rampage all over the place.\u201cDamn! Those eight legged bastards are really a pain in the ass in the dark forest.\u201dThe Jade Blade Spiders were drawing closer to Shi Yan and were almost upon him.Shi Yan\u2019s heart was beating like a jungle drum and his back was sweating like a waterfall. According to the situation, he knew that sooner or later he would be captured by those Jade Blade Spiders. By that time, he would have already run out of Profound Qi and would have no way to defend himself against those giant spiders.Water! Suddenly Shi Yan could feel a moist vapor coming from his left side with his sharpened senses. Shi Yan took a deep breath and smiled with joy. He suddenly changed direction and rushed towards his left.There is water here!Shi Yan concentrated his senses and listened closely to his surroundings. Not surprisingly, only a few minutes after he changed direction, Shi Yan could hear the most wonderful sound of water flowing in the distance.Only a few minutes later, a new landscape spread out in front of Shi Yan\u2019s eyes. There was a large waterfall, with the water curtain disappearing into the deep pool like shooting stars in the galaxy. Some of the falling water sprayed onto the giant rocks on the shore, with water drops spilling and jumping all over the place like pearls and dense water vapor rising above the pool like a net.\u201cSplash!\u201dShi Yan quickly jumped into the freezing pool like a swift arrow. He felt instantly relieved, and thought that he could finally ditch those Jade Blade Spiders.\u201cSplash! Splash! Splash!\u201dHowever, the six giant spiders also followed him into the deep pool, one by one. They were floating above the water like boats. With their eight giant legs moving around in the water, they swam quickly towards Shi Yan.\u201cDamn it!\u201d There was no time for Shi Yan to take a break and he was absolutely desperate. Seeing those Jade Blade Spiders approaching, he had no choice but to dive into the water and swim towards the bottom of the pool.Shi Yan kept holding his breath and dived deeper and deeper into the pool. He only dared to look up when he was already more than seven meters under the surface.From beneath, he could clearly see the sharp legs of those six Jade Blade Spiders. The spiders were stabbing their legs, which were as sharp as knives, into the water and chopping around.The Jade Blade Spiders were not afraid of the water and they had no difficulty floating above the surface. However, it seemed they didn\u2019t want to dive under the water. The six beasts were just blindly stabbing and chopping their legs into the surface, but only the surface.Seeing this, Shi Yan was quite relieved. He held his breath and waited patiently in the water.Holding his breath was one of Shi Yan\u2019s strengths. He had participated in a lot of extreme sports programs like this before and therefore had rich experience in this. With one breath, he could survive underwater for more than 10 minutes.The Jade Blade Spiders didn\u2019t stay long on the water. After chopping their legs for a while with no trace of Shi Yan, the six giant beasts soon left the pool one after another.Only then could Shi Yan float to the surface. When he saw the six Jade Blade Spiders still by the shore, he instantly stopped floating up and started observing those demon beasts very carefully in secret.The six demon beasts soon left.Only then did Shi Yan rise to the surface. He took a deep breath of the surrounding damp air, and dive back to the bottom of the pool. After exhausting his breath, he would rise again to the surface near one of the giant rocks on the corner of the pool. He repeated this process over and over again, breathing, diving and rising, breathing, diving and rising.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe was a little worried that those Jade Blade Spiders would come back, but was more worried that Master Karu and Mo Yanyu would find him by following the tracks of those giant beasts. Therefore, he was extra cautious, not willing to come out of the water to soon.At the bottom of the pool.Shi Yan was still holding his breath and doing his own meditation. He started to think about the strange energy he had appeared from his Meridians. He remembered that when the two Warriors died, he happened to be nearby, and it seemed that he had stolen all their Profound Qi through his Meridians. Regardless, he definitely had gotten something valuable from those two Warriors.When he was running from the Jade Blade Spiders, he could strongly feel a strange energy spilling over from his Meridians. This energy was so pure and when it mixed with his Profound Qi inside his body, the energy instantly made his Profound Qi increase much faster and it almost doubled in minutes. But Shi Yan couldn\u2019t figure out why.Could it be that his Meridians had absorbed the energy from those two Warriors, refined this energy into a much more pure and concentrated force, and empowered Shi Yan\u2019s own body?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10 \u2013 Drag Her DownAt the bottom of the pool.Shi Yan had gradually recovered his Profound Qi that had been exhausted from running from those Jade Blade Spiders. He had been secretly watching the surroundings of the pool very carefully. He wasn\u2019t sure as to whether the giant spiders would come back or whether Mo Yanyu and Master Karu would come here. Just to be safe, he decided to stay in the pool for a little longer, and would only leave when he made sure he was no longer in danger.With the Profound Qi flowing around his body, Shi Yan felt this short period of resting had already recovered the majority of his Profound Qi. His senses had become sharper and he could even hear the wind blowing through the grass and trees on the surface, despite the fact that he was still underwater.Before long, he saw a beautiful figure show up on the shore. She was standing by a giant rock on the shore, probing her surroundings with a cold glint in her eyes.Shi Yan suddenly became nervous and secretly dove three meters deeper. He would only swim around in secret when he had made sure that Mo Yanyu couldn\u2019t see him from the shore.Shi Yan was moving very slowly, afraid to make any ripple on the surface of the pool. He was very focused, swimming like a fish at the bottom of the pool. He even swam to different parts of the pool, just to make sure there\u2019s no danger from different areas of the shore.After making sure that Mo Yanyu was the only person on the shore, he secretly swam closer to the rock by which she was standing. He stayed there for a minute, looking up at the vague figure of the beautiful woman from the water. Shi Yan hesitated for a while, but still kept moving up in the water, very slowly.\u201cFucking bastard! Don\u2019t let me catch you, otherwise I will make you suffer so much pain that you will beg for death!\u201d Mo Yanyu was cursing on the shore. Her face was twisted with anger.\u201cSplash!\u201dSuddenly something rose up from the water beneath her feet. Mo Yanyu was shocked. Before she could react, one of her beautiful legs was grabbed by something. She instantly felt stunned by a strong wave of energy and her body weakened and fell into the pool.\u201cBoom!\u201dShe felt her soft abdomen heavily punched by something and a sharp pain was spreading to her whole body. Mo Yanyu started to sink with a higher speed. She could barely breathe and had already swallowed a lot of water from the pool, which almost choked her tears out.When she finally came to her senses, Mo Yanyu found herself grabbed by someone and dragged to the bottom of the pool in a brutal manner. When she could finally take a closer look, she instantly realized that she had fallen into Shi Yan\u2019s trap due to negligence.\u201cOh crap!\u201dMo Yanyu was shocked by this. She knew that she was not a good swimmer so she wouldn\u2019t want to fight with Shi Yan here. She was grabbing the water with both hands, trying hard to float up to the surface to plan her next step.\u201cHuh, want to run? Try me!\u201dShi Yan couldn\u2019t help but snort. As soon as Mo Yanyu was dragged into the pool, he could tell that she was not good in the water. At that moment, Shi Yan realized that this was his best shot get revenge for himself and humiliate Mo Yanyu at the same time. How could he let such a great opportunity pass by?With one hand firmly grabbing Mo Yanyu\u2019s beautiful leg, Shi Yan kept dragging her down with all his might. His other hand kept pounding hard into her abdomen with a strong fist, determined to make her swallow some more water.\u201cBoom!\u201dWith another fist on Mo Yanyu\u2019s abdomen, Shi Yan felt her skin, which was previously soft, suddenly became as solid as a steel. After this hit, she was not frustrated at all, but still working very hard to reach the surface of the pool.On the other side, after the hit, Shi Yan felt an intense pain on his fist.She is using her Profound Qi for self-defense!Shi Yan instantly realized that Mo Yanyu had started her own defense. Seeing her flailing in the water with both hands, getting closer and closer to the surface. Shi Yan suddenly came up with a thousand ideas.In three seconds, Shi Yan had come up with a new plan.Mo Yanyu was still trying her best to reach the surface of the pool. Noticing that Shi Yan had stopped punching her in the abdomen, she got a little too proud of herself, assuming that Shi Yan had exhausted his means.However, not long after that smile appeared on her face, Mo Yanyu suddenly turned very pale in panic with a terrible look on her face.With one hand still grabbing her leg like a clamp, Shi Yan started to shamelessly harass her ass and the part between her thighs. This is the most precious and sensitive part of her body, she had not allowed any man to touch or violate it. But now this man in front of her was insatiably groping her thighs as if she were his bitch. Mo Yanyu felt so ashamed she almost couldn\u2019t breathe.Just when she was about to burst into rage and fight with Shi Yan, Mo Yanyu found that the silk pants she had been wearing had been stripped down by Shi Yan. He had even torn down her little panties and left her entire lower body exposed in front of Shi Yan\u2019s eyes.She had never shown any man this secret part of her body. However, this man had successfully humiliated her in such an outrageous way. Mo Yanyu\u2019s mind suddenly went blank.Suddenly, she could feel a big finger forcing its way into her body and it felt like she was being struck by a bolt of lightning. With a thread of electricity flowing through her body, she instantly went numb in her lower body. There was a warm wave of energy making its way out of her body.Shi Yan also felt shocked, but it didn\u2019t feel as good as he thought. He was actually hit by the lightning that came out of Mo Yanyu\u2019s body. It seemed that her body would defend herself by discharging a jolt of electricity shock when violated. This lightning had struck him pretty hard and he suddenly couldn\u2019t feel his hands. All of a sudden, Shi Yan had lost his power.At the moment, Mo Yanyu suddenly felt herself much lighter in the water. She realized that Shi Yan had released her. She suddenly regained her senses. Forcing her way through the water with all her might, Mo Yanyu finally rose up to the surface of the pool, filled with grief and indignation.On the other hand, Shi Yan was still floating in the water, feasting his eyes on the million dollar view above his head. He could clearly see the two sexy legs of Mo Yanyu moving around on the pool surface, her ass which had such a nice curve, as well as the delicious parts between her thighs which were apparently his favorite.However, he was affected pretty heavily and couldn\u2019t feel any strength right now. He couldn\u2019t do anything but let Mo Yanyu keep swimming towards a big rock on the shore of the pool.Before long, Mo Yanyu had arrived at the rock. She grabbed the rock with one hand, and screamed with a raging fire burning in her vicious eyes, \u201cYou fucking animal! Come out!\u201dHaving lost her pants, Mo Yanyu couldn\u2019t get out of the pool and still needed to hide her lower body in the water. She couldn\u2019t do anything but scream like hell. Her hatred was burning and lightning was dancing around her fingers. She would pay any price to burn Shi Yan into a crisp.After slowly operating his Profound Qi inside his body for a while, Shi Yan felt his discomfort had been mostly alleviated and he had recovered his strength. Still hiding in the water, Shi Yan stared at Mo Yanyu by the big rock on the shore for a while with a greedy look. He couldn\u2019t help licking his lips and fantasizing about the woman\u2019s body. Although she had a heart as dark as a scorpion, she had the most attractive look to any man, one in a million. He couldn\u2019t get enough of her.Now that Mo Yanyu had already set up her defense, Shi Yan knew that it was impossible for him to drag her down into the water again. This woman had achieved the Nascent Realm for Warriors and possessed the scary Lightning Martial Spirit. If she was already on alert, there\u2019s no way that he could strike again.If Mo Yanyu kept screaming and shouting like this, it wouldn\u2019t be long before Master Karu and the other warriors from the Mo family found the two of them. If he didn\u2019t get away now, he probably wouldn\u2019t get another chance later.Having thought about this, Shi Yan didn\u2019t hesitate at all. He quickly swam from one side of the pool to the other, away from Mo Yanyu, and got up onto the shore.He kept his little brother pretty aroused, teasing Mo Yanyu across the pool with a proud smile on his face and a big bulge in his pants, \u201cBack then, just what the heck was that stuff coming out of your pussy? It was pretty warm and sweet. You must have enjoyed me back there.\u201dWith her lower body still naked in the water, Mo Yanyu didn\u2019t dare to come onto the shore. Hearing him saying this, Mo Yanyu\u2019s body felt like it was hit by a lightning bolt. She screamed like crazy, \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you! You bastard! I am so killing you! I swear! I will cut you into pieces!\u201dShi Yan replied with a snort on his face, \u201cBitch! I\u2019ve already tasted your pussy. How are you gonna get married? Kill me? Huh! Next time, you won\u2019t be this lucky with only my finger inside of your body!\u201dAfter saying that, he shook his little brother in an exaggerated manner in front of Mo Yanyu\u2019s eyes, putting on a teasing smile and left before she could burst out with rage. Shi Yan quickly disappeared into the bushes.Mo Yanyu was so angry that she could hardly breathe. She fired waves of lightning towards Shi Yan, but the lightning could barely cross the pool, degrading into little electric sparks and disappearing after a few hundred meters, to say nothing of hurting Shi Yan.Gasping heavily, Mo Yanyu could feel her hatred burning in her eyes endlessly. As much as she would like to strike back, her lower body was still naked in the water, so she wouldn\u2019t dare to make a move. After a while, after making sure that Shi Yan wouldn\u2019t come back, she swam to the middle of the pool to retrieve her pants which were floating on the surface.\u201cMiss Mo, I remember you were chasing somebody. How come you jumped into the pool to take a nice bath?\u201dMo Yanyu heard the creepy voice of Master Karu from behind her as she finished dressing on the shore. Startled, she quickly turned around, seeing Master Karu staring at her with two horny eyes. Master Karu was like a starving wolf, staring right at her wet body, which looked so delicious with its beautiful curves. Mo Yanyu was offended but couldn\u2019t say anything to Master Karu. She held back her raging anger and replied mercilessly, \u201cI was dragged down into the water by that motherfucking asshole!\u201d\u201cOh!\u201d Master Karu nodded. His greedy eyes still didn\u2019t stop roaming over Mo Yanyu\u2019s sexy body. He said with a horny smile on his face, \u201cMiss Mo, you\u2026 didn\u2019t let him do things to you, did you?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHell no!\u201d Mo Yanyu denied with a cold face, \u201cIt\u2019s just I\u2019m not good with the water, so he took the chance to get away.\u201d\u201cWhich direction?\u201d Master Karu said with a weird frown, \u201cThat guy had the strangest body structure. Even my Gut Cutting poison couldn\u2019t break him. He was indeed a good trial subject. I won\u2019t let someone like him escape.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s not waste any time!\u201d Mo Yanyu was already furious. She didn\u2019t want to waste too much time with Master Karu and started chasing Shi Yan right away, heading in the direction he disappeared.Once she turned around, Master Karu started staring at her sexy curves with his creepy, cold snake-like eyes.After staring at her wet plump ass for a while, the beautiful body of Mo Yanyu disappeared into the bushes. Master Karu laughed with a horny smile and followed her with lightning speed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 11 \u2013 Strike BackA crowd of people had started to gather in the Dark Forest, which was filled with all kinds of trees and plants. Warriors from the Mo family had separated into groups and were searching for Shi Yan in their designated areas. They all had a depressed look on their faces.Mo Yanyu\u2019s face was as cold as ever. She gave her order in a sharp voice, \u201cGo search for that bastard! Now! Once you have found any trace of him, set off the blue smoke bomb! Don\u2019t fight him individually!\u201d\u201cIt has been 3 days and we still cannot find that guy, but we keep finding traces of him. Is he that poor at covering his tracks, or has he been intentionally playing with us?\u201d Master Karu said with a sour face, apparently irritated by Shi Yan\u2019s tricks.For the past few days, the whole crowd had been looking for Shi Yan in the Dark Forest. They could occasionally see the footprints and broken tree branches he left behind on his way through. He must have been around this area for days, but no matter how hard they searched, they couldn\u2019t find anything, not even the smallest clue as to the whereabouts of Shi Yan.\u201cSearch a bigger area!\u201d Mo Yanyu was pissed off, and shouted her new order, \u201cStart from here and search separately! Do your best! Once you see him, release the blue smoke bomb! I will be there in an instant!\u201dThe warriors of the Mo family all complied obediently.\u201cIs it okay to leave the Ground Dragon alone?\u201d Master Karu frowned, and said worriedly, \u201cAll my medicine bottles are with the dragon. If that boy goes over there to mess with my medicine, he would cause me more trouble than I could handle.\u201d\u201cMaster Karu, don\u2019t you worry. The Ground Dragon is being guarded by Johnson and seven other warriors. Johnson has already reached the Third Sky of the Elementary Realm. That asshole is no match for him.\u201d Mo Yanyu said with a proud face.Master Karu nodded in consent.The warriors of the Mo family had moved further and further away, and the members had become more and more distanced from each other. With one hand on the blue smoke bomb, the warriors were not that stressed. As soon as they saw any trace of Shi Yan, all they had to do was to set off the blue smoke. Simple enough!One of the warriors was walking in the shade, cursing Shi Yan at the same time with an angry face. He looked up at the tree branches above his head, and then checked the bushes around his ankles.They had been searching this area for the past three days! All for a junior warrior who had barely reached the Elementary Realm! There was no trace of him at all. They didn\u2019t even believe that he was still in the area, they all thought that Shi Yan had already left. Therefore, all the warriors were not happy when they were ordered to search this area again, complaining in secret and thinking that they were wasting their time. There was no point for them to do this!The warrior arrived under one of the aged trees, shaded by all the thick branches and leaves. This time, when he looked up, all he could feel was a chill, cold and evil, pouring down onto him. All of a sudden, Shi Yan jumped down from the tree like a fierce wolf, crushing the warrior\u2019s face with his knee.\u201cBoom!\u201dWith a strong blow, the warrior\u2019s face was instantly covered in fresh blood. He fell on the ground, with his eyes filled with blood and tears. For a moment, he couldn\u2019t see anything.All he could do was stab his dagger wildly, shouting in panic, \u201cHere! He\u2019s over here!\u201dBefore he could release the blue smoke bomb in his left hand, an intense pain spread from his left wrist. He couldn\u2019t stand it and let the blue smoke bomb be taken away from him.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dShi Yan put on the cruelest face he had ever made. Before he could realize, his eyes had already turned dark red and there was a murderous look in his eyes. He moved swiftly around the warrior, hiding away from his random stabbings and continued stepping on his face, showing no mercy.With his Profound Qi running wild through both of his legs, Shi Yan\u2019s every hit was as powerful as an iron hammer. Under such strong attacks, it only took five strikes for the warrior to stop breathing.Seeing this, Shi Yan stepped towards the dead warrior, grabbed the dagger from his lifeless hand and stabbed straight into the warrior\u2019s neck with a precise and cruel cut. Shi Yan\u2019s face remained calm and cold all this time.All of a sudden, a strong wave of invisible energy spilled out of the warrior\u2019s body, mixed with strings of emotions such as distress, anger and panic, all pouring out at once. The energy was quickly absorbed by Shi Yan and flowed into his Meridians. Within a few seconds, the warrior had lost all his Profound Qi and turned into a mummified body.Shi Yan approached the dead body again. He searched through his pockets with a frown, and only found a packet of food and a few dozen Purple Crystal Coins. Shi Yan took away his possessions and quickly left the scene. He didn\u2019t want to stop in one place for long, making his way swiftly through the dark forest swiftly like a fox, and soon disappearing into the trees.This was the first time that he had ever taken a man\u2019s life. However, he was not at all nervous or panicky. He had remained calm and cool-headed the whole time. When he was stepping hard onto the warrior\u2019s face, he felt nothing but an overwhelming thrill, a great satisfaction that he couldn\u2019t describe with words. He was free. He felt like he was a warrior by nature, and that he was born to kill.The killing had brought him a feeling of euphoria, it was the most wonderful moment that he had never experienced. All the unpleasant feelings that had been haunting him for days were instantly cast away the moment he cut that warrior\u2019s neck.Deep down, Shi Yan knew this wasn\u2019t right, and that there must be something wrong with his body. No normal person would be this calm and steady when killing his first victim, not like him. Normal people wouldn\u2019t feel this kind of thrill or bliss either. However, he was like an obsessed drug addict when it came to murder and killing.As the Profound Qi from the warrior\u2019s body rushed into Shi Yan\u2019s Meridians, there was again a strong urge of murder flaring up inside his body. Before long, a strange energy poured into his Profound Qi, making it even stronger and more concentrated than ever.This felt so good!For five days, Shi Yan was like a ghost in the Dark Forest. He was everywhere, always killing, and always precise and accurate. The murders all happened in sneak attacks before those poor warriors had chance to release their blue smoke bombs in their hand.Within days, another three warriors became Shi Yan\u2019s victims. Every time, when their bodies were discovered, they had already become mummified, with all their blood and Profound Qi sucked away.Mo Yanyu became more and more agitated. She searched and searched around the dark forest with Master Karu, desperate to dig Shi Yan out. Both of them had started to smell a crisis on the horizon.For the first victim, his face was terribly destroyed, with a cruel blow to his head, and there were still some traces of a struggle.For the second and third victims, they were both secretly attacked from behind, with several brutal stabs in their hearts and abdomen, with only traces of a brief fight still there.However, for the last warrior, he was killed instantly with a clear cut on the throat and there was no trace of a fight at all.Judging from the four dead warriors, Shi Yan was becoming more and more skilled at killing. The Dark Forest had become a perfect arena for showing off his talent of murder. He skillfully used the landscape to cover his own tracks. Like an experienced hunter, he was secretly hiding in the forest, watching and waiting for his next prey.The death of those four warriors had made the other warriors all very nervous. Mo Yanyu and Master Karu were also starting to take this seriously. As per their new orders, the warriors were not allowed to act individually. They were only allowed to move in groups of two. This way, if one of them was attacked, the other one could come right over it help, in order to avoid the tragedy that had happened before.In the Dark Forest, on the top of an aged tree, wrapped and covered by layers of leaves, Shi Yan sat cross-legged in silence, looking at those little human figures in the distance through the leaves.\u201cHuh, not as stupid as before\u2026\u201d Shi Yan sniffed from the inside. He knew it wouldn\u2019t be that easy for him to strike and kill now.Shi Yan didn\u2019t rush into attacks. He watched those warriors for a while, and noticed that after the death of the previous four warriors, the Mo family warriors had started to act in groups of two, hence they couldn\u2019t cover a search area as large as before. Right now, they were not coming in his direction, but moving away from Shi Yan\u2019s location.After making sure that the warriors were not coming his way, at least not in a short period of time, Shi Yan closed his eyes quietly, and started to circulate the Profound Qi inside his body. The Profound Qi of those killed by Shi Yan over the past few days had all been absorbed by Shi Yan\u2019s Meridians shortly after they died, and was purifying his Meridians and strengthening his Profound Qi in a powerful way.Shi Yan started to circulate the Profound Qi inside his body faster and faster with his mind. He could clearly feel that his Profound Qi was much stronger than before, rushing through his Meridians like an intense lightning all over his body, from his abdomen and all the way to his right arm. Shi Yan held his breath, cleared his mind, and concentrated all his attention in pouring the Profound Qi into his right arm. Now! He released this burning energy all at once!The Profound Qi inside his arm was flowing rapidly towards his right index finger like wild horses escaping from their reins.\u201cShoot!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSome silver colored light smoke suddenly shot out of his right index finger, making a strange sound the air. The light smoke didn\u2019t gather in the air and only lasted for a few minutes before it faded away.Shi Yan opened his eyes, with bright stars shining in his black eyes and a surprised smile on his face.He had successfully managed to push his Profound Qi outside of his body!This marked him reaching the Third Sky of the Elementary Realm. After his rigorous practice over the past few days, he had finally made it to a new level with the help of that strange power inside his Meridians.Although the Profound Qi that was forced from his body was not in a concentrated shape, and couldn\u2019t make itself into a sharp beam, he would be able to infuse his Profound Qi into all kinds of killing weapons, and could directly rupture the enemy\u2019s organs with his Profound Qi shot; which meant that he had already reached a milestone in his control and operation of Profound Qi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This mysterious ring, which he had named the \u2018Blood Vein Ring\u2019, came from the blood pool, and had some connection with it.As he was thinking, he recalled the time when he wore the ring for the first time. Back then, the Profound Qi in his body was very weak, but the moment he wore the ring, it rushed toward the ring in a wild manner. But since it was too weak then, his Qi couldn\u2019t flow into the ring across his skin.Now he had already reached the Third Sky, meaning his Profound Qi had been strengthened and refined to the point that it could move out of his body.What would happen if his Profound Qi went into the ring?Shi Yan was curious and guessed that there was a secret inside this ancient ring. Maybe after studying this ring, he could find out the reason why his meridians changed.Through the leaves, Shi Yan observed for a while. Three warriors from Mo family were moving away from him, and would not come back for a short time.Shi Yan decided to give it a shot!At first, the Profound Qi was flowing slowly in his dantian, then it suddenly accelerated and rushed into his left arm. His Qi moved rapidly and he felt a numb pain in the veins of his left arm. The Qi, rushed all the way into the ring finger on his left hand with a crushing force, and lashed against the skin under the ring.Like smoke, the Profound Qi leaked out from between the ring and the skin, making the sound of steam coming out of a kettle, and the pure energy dived right inside the ring in an instant.The Blood Vein Ring let out a crimson light, as if the protective layer of the ring had been ruptured. At this point, a strange energy jumped out of the Blood Vein Ring and flew back into Shi Yan\u2019s arm. It went straight up his neck and finally arrived in his mind.Martial Skill: [Rampage]!The energy coming out of the Blood Vein Ring was a series of memory fragments. This [Rampage], was a strange Martial Skill. The training procedure became deeply engraved in his mind.Martial Skills taught warriors how to operate their Profound Qi, and contained a skill for attacking with Profound Qi. Just like the ranking for Alchemists, it was divided into five grades: Mortal, Profound, Spirit, Sacred and God. [1]But there were some differences between the ranking of Martial Skills and that of Alchemists. Every grade of Alchemists consisted of seven sub-levels, while Martial Skills contained no sub-levels.High grade Martial Skills brought the best out of the Profound Qi inside a Warrior and provided them with an enormous ability to attack. The higher the grade of the Martial Skill, the better it tapped their Profound Qi. If a warrior was to train with a high grade Martial Skill, he had to reach a high level first. The stronger the Martial Skill, the stricter the conditions it required.Generally speaking, warriors of the Elementary and Nascent Realm were suitable for training Mortal and Human level Martial Skills, Disaster Realm for Profound and Earth level skills, Nirvana Realm for Spirit and Sky level skills, Spirit Realm for Sacred level skills and True God and King God Realm for God level skills.It was a waste of time if a warrior of a lower grade tried to train with high grade Martial Skills.If one\u2019s grade was too low and their Profound Qi was not intense enough, one would not succeed in learning a high grade Martial Skill. Even if they barely succeeded, he could not use the power of a high grade Martial Skill proficiently, as their Realm and power would not be enough to sustain them. It was best for a warrior to train with Martial Skills which matched their Warrior Realm.For example, even if a warrior of the Nascent Realm possessed God level Martial Skill, it would be a total waste of time, because he would never be able to train it with his low Realm.Conversely, if a warrior of a high Realm trained with a low level Martial Skill, he couldn\u2019t put his power to good use either.If a warrior of the True God Realm had only low grade Martial Skills of the Mortal and Profound grade, his ability would be restricted. For, if his Martial Skills were too low for his warrior Realm, he could only use 70%-80% of his ability.On the Grace mainland, Martial Skills were more treasured than pills from alchemists; they were the most valuable treasure on this earth. Generally speaking, Martial Skills were controlled by those honorable families and all sorts of forces. It was one of the attractions for warriors, as such they often joined to those honorable families to have access to them.The higher the grade, the more valuable the Martial Skill. Warriors of a high Realm would be severely restricted if they didn\u2019t possess a high grade Martial Skill. They would be at a disadvantage, sometimes resulting in them being killed in fights.Thus, in order to acquire a suitable high grade Martial Skill, those high-levelled warriors would sacrifice anything.Sitting straight up in the foliage, Shi Yan sorted out the memories of [Rampage] in his mind little by little. After he put those memory fragments in order, he found that the [Rampage] Martial Skill consisted of three levels as well. What got imprinted in his mind now was only the first level of the training process. He had no idea what Martial Skill grade [Rampage] was, or whether [Rampage] suited him or not.This Martial Skill leaked out from the Blood Vein Ring and rushed into his mind in a direct yet weird way. To train in this Martial Skill one needed to reverse the flow of their Profound Qi, which was of the opposite most Martial Skills. Shi Yan hesitated, could he train this incomplete Martial Skill, whose story was still unknown.As one of the five biggest families in the Merchant Union, the Shi family had its own Martial Skills, the highest of which reached the Spirit level. It was regarded as a family heirloom by the family head of Shi family, Shi Jian. This old man was the only person who had reached the Realm required to train with it.Nonetheless, apart from this Spirit level Martial Skill, the Shi family also possessed Mortal and Profound level Martial Skills.Shi Yan had decided to return to Shi family and train with their Mortal and Profound level Martial Skills with his new identity. But now, the Blood Vein Ring had produced this mysterious and unknown Martial Skill. He was totally confused, should he train with it or not?With a rigid face, Shi Yan tried to refine his Profound Qi and pushed it into the Blood Vein Ring, only to find his Profound Qi blocked by a protective screen within the Ring. No matter how hard he tried, his Profound Qi couldn\u2019t break the screen. He came to the vague conclusion that there was something behind that protective screen, but he would never know until it was broken.Behind that protective screen, there might be more information about [Rampage]. Most likely it would be the process of the other two levels of training. Sadly, his Profound Qi could not break that screen until it was strong enough.Helplessly, Shi Yan withdrew his Profound Qi from the ring. He arranged the incomplete memory fragments of the Martial Skill again, but he was still hesitant.To train with it or not?Being wrapped in foliage with his eyes shining, Shi Yan\u2019s facial expressions kept on changing. After a very long time, he decided to see what would happen to his body if he trained in the first level of [Rampage].His Profound Qi moved towards the Jugu Meridian slowly. After it arrived, according to the spinning process of first level of [Rampage], Shi Yan slowly injected his Profound Qi into the Jugu Meridan. Instantly, it started to spin rapidly. Negative moods buried in that meridian, such as hatred, despair and insanity, were all triggered in a burst, which turned into a certain force and began to change the veins, bones, blood and flesh around the Jugu Meridian.All of a sudden, he felt a severe pain.The blood and flesh around the Jugu Meridian suddenly contracted and his muscles became tight instantly.After a quick thought, Shi Yan began to reverse the flow of his Profound Qi in no time. An unbearable pain suddenly raced through his whole body and felt that his veins were very nearly torn apart. After it travelled several inches, Shi Yan made up his mind and forced his Profound Qi up. His Profound Qi jumped across the Jugu Meridian and rushed to the Jianzhen Meridian like an angry beast.After it accumulated in his Jianzhen Meridian, his Profound Qi spun just like before, which again brought out those negative moods of hatred, despair and anger hidden in the meridian all at once. The blood and flesh in that area began to contract again. To Shi Yan\u2019s surprise, there was even a vague grey fog rising up from each pore on his shoulder, which was mixed with despair and hatred. Haunting!The Profound Qi reversed again. Shi Yan felt a splitting pain in his right arm and his forehead and back were both soaked in sweat.Severe pain!Biting his teeth, the insanity inside Shi Yan broke out abruptly. Despite the pain in his arm, Shi Yan continued to urge his Profound Qi in the direction of Wuli Meridian\u2026After an unknown passage of time, Shi Yan moved his Profound Qi all the way from his Jugu Meridian to his Yangchi Meridian near his wrist, all while suppressing the desire to vomit. All sorts of negative energy inside the meridians of his the right arm seemed to be brought out at once!Examining carefully, Shi Yan found the muscles on his right arm had contracted, so much so that they were much thinner than before. The dim grey fog curled up his arm ceaselessly, conveying those negative moods.Merely by looking at it, one would be easily affected by its power, feeling extremely terrified.The Profound Qi was moving back and forth in his arm. A strong power which could burst a dam was surging in his arm, combined with all sorts of negative moods. Shi Yan felt enormous power in his right arm, as if it would burst out at any minute.In the bottom of his heart, a series of whims containing killing and cruelty showed up.Breathing heavily, Shi Yan\u2019s eyes showed a murderous look. Among the trees, he started searching for targets, viciously like a wolf. How he wished he could grind every person he saw into powder with his right arm. It wouldn\u2019t be content until he smashed those people into mud.\u2026A short while later, two shadows, along with loud curses, were moving towards his direction slowly. They were both warriors of the Mo family. After searching other places but finding no trace of Shi Yan, they were sent by Mo Yanyu to search this area.\u201cWhere is that bastard? I\u2019m gonna cut off his head at sight of him! Crap! My mistress is still waiting for me in the Merchant Union. I have wasted too much of my time here because of that bastard! Damn!\u201d A stout warrior was viciously cursing, whose face was buried under a heavy moustache.\u201cZhen Tie, Be careful! That bastard killed four of us! He must be a tough one to deal with. He ate twice what we eat for one meal, so strange! Don\u2019t underestimate him!\u201d The other warrior looked cautious, and he kept looking around, being more careful apparently.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We are both at the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm. And we are two people. It\u2019s asking for death if that bastard tries to attack us. Hmm! Let us kill him soon so that we can leave! I have enough with this crazy place. I want women! Women!\u201d The warrior named Zhen Tie seemed too eager for a woman that he began to shout in the woods.\u201cYeah well\u2026 Miss Mo is a woman too\u2026\u201dThat cautious warrior mocked in a low voice.\u201cWell, Miss Mo is a woman. But she is out of our league. I noticed that Master Karu went to Miss Mo quite a lot these days. Maybe he has a good chance. Look at Miss Mo; that face, that ass, hmm, let\u2019s see which lucky bastard could get her. Our level is too low. There is not even a slightest hope in this life!\u201dZhen Tie lowered his voice, wearing sinister smile on his face. He seemed to be having some fantasy. When it came to a joyful part, he straightened his body and laughed loudly.\u201cStop daydreaming! Miss Mo is already engaged. That Ling Shaofeng is a very tough guy. If he knew you are fantasizing about her, you would be dead!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUpon hearing Ling Shaofeng\u2019s name, Zhen Tie looked panicked. He whispered, \u201cThat kid is too strange! I have heard that he has almost reached the Human Realm. I have seen him kill! He is unimaginably cruel! Even Master Karu would not escape if he annoyed Ling Shaofeng. Seriously, we have to be careful. If he heard what we said\u2026\u201dZhen Tie shivered. Apparently he was too scared of Mo Yanyu\u2019s fianc\u00e9e.With rigid faces, the two discussed Ling Shaofeng as they walked toward where Shi Yan was, not knowing that in the thick leaves above them, there was a bloody beast.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014[1] Mortal, Profound, Spirit, Sacred and God: five grades of Martial skills.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He panted, suddenly jumping up from the thicket. His Profound Qi was flowing in his right arm like waves with a fierce and violent killing energy which was about to explode from the inside.\u201cCrap!\u201dThe warrior who had been on alert suddenly paled, and screamed loudly for help. Landing on top of his head, Shi Yan started his strike like a sharp sword as his Profound Qi formed into a thick smog around his arm. Ahead of him, Shi Yan cast his Profound Qi out like a net, which tightly wrapped up the warrior\u2019s head in an instant.In that moment, an intense wave of negative feelings, blended with endless resentment and desperation, suddenly rushed into his nose and mouth. The Mo family warrior felt like he was standing in the middle of a bloody ocean with thousands of evil spirits flying towards him, grabbing him with full force and tearing him apart. He couldn\u2019t move even if he tried to.\u201cThump!\u201dShi Yan\u2019s iron-like fist struck the warrior\u2019s skull with a mighty force. With a clear sound, the warrior\u2019s skull exploded; he didn\u2019t even get to scream before he breathed his last breath. All his Profound Qi rushed out and was directly absorbed into Shi Yan\u2019s meridians.The other warrior named Zheng Tie, looked absolutely horrified and instantly set off his blue smoke bomb. The blue smoke bomb flew up into the sky and exploded with a shining blue light even brighter than the sun.\u201cLook! Over there!\u201dSeeing that blue light, Mo Yanyu suddenly got excited. She turned around, and quickly flew towards that direction with no hesitation. Master Karu didn\u2019t move at first. He sneered for a moment, and then followed Mo Yanyu.\u201cYou bastard! Let\u2019s see how you get away this time?\u201d After releasing the blue smoke bomb, Zheng Tie was not as panicky as before. He stared at Shi Yan with burning eyes and sneered, \u201cWe have been looking for you all this time. Finally, you came out. This time, where can you run to?\u201dShi Yan was breathing heavily. With the bloodlust becoming more and more concentrated in his eyes, Shi Yan could feel an endless urge for blood within his chest. That warrior\u2019s Profound Qi which flew into Shi Yan\u2019s body after he died had further fuelled this killing impulse within his body. It was as if there was a voice whispering into his ears, continuously encouraging him to indulge in his desire for blood.Seeing that Shi Yan was just standing there panting, instead of making a move towards him, Zheng Tie felt a bit relieved. He kept his distance from Shi Yan and sneered, \u201cHey you, Miss Mo and Master Karu will be here in a moment. You are gonna die for sure!\u201dWith a roar rising out of his throat, Shi Yan suddenly flew towards Zheng Tie, like a caged beast running wild. There was a beam of white smoke surrounding his right arm which looked just like a giant snake. The snake suddenly jumped out and came right towards Zheng Tie\u2019s neck.Zheng Tie was already prepared. He didn\u2019t directly counter Shi Yan. Instead, he moved away from by a couple of meters.However, that snake of white smoke was not that easy to get rid of. It kept chasing Zheng Tie as if it was alive. Even though Zheng Tie stepped back, it didn\u2019t give up and still followed him, intending to wrap around him like a cocoon.Zheng Tie was a little surprised. He sniffed a little and started to cut the smoke snake with the sharp blade in his hands.The white smoke snake was cut into half instantly. However, it didn\u2019t stop. The two parts of snake rose up and started to wrap around both of his arms. At that moment, two waves of evil spirits rushed into Zheng Tie\u2019s head. His body froze, both eyes filled with bloody scenes and creepy skeletons. He felt like he was suddenly deprived of all his power.\u201cBoom!\u201dShi Yan arrived right in front of Zheng Tie and hit him in the face with all the force in his right fist. In just one hit, an ocean of bloody and turbulent Profound Qi exploded out of Shi Yan\u2019s fist and drilled straight into Zheng Tie\u2019s head.With blood all over his face, as well as a terrified and unbelievable look in his eyes, Zheng Tie felt a chill running down his body and he collapsed face down on the ground. His Profound Qi flew out just like those dead warriors before him.The bodies of the two warriors gradually turned into mummies, without a trace of blood on their faces, drained of all their Profound Qi.Despite all the fierce bloodlust roaring in his mind, Shi Yan retain his rationale and carefully checked the belongings of those two dead warriors. He collected all the valuable food and crystal coins and climbed into the ancient tree like an agile monkey. He hid himself among those thick leaves and branches, and told himself to calm down, ovefur and over again.However, the crazy desire for blood was still there in his mind. Shi Yan sat there and started to operate his Profound Qi. The Profound Qi that had been flowing within his right arm a moment ago was gradually maneuvered into his abdomen and his right arm had returned to normal.Shi Yan tried his best to control his breath and withdrew the flying evil spirits back into his body. The killing light gradually disappeared from his eyes. Through the thick leaves, Shi Yan looked at the movement on the ground in full concentration.Before long, a crowd started to gather under the tree. The first two were also warriors from the Mo family. Like Zheng Tie, they were also Elementary Realm Warriors that had reached the Second Sky, and couldn\u2019t push their Profound Qi out of their body yet. They looked alert after they arrived, and they kept looking around for traces of Shi Yan, afraid he might strike again.After a while, Mo Yanyu and Master Karu arrived one after another. Mo Yanyu arrived first. She took a quick look at the two dried bodies lying on the ground, and said in a firm voice, \u201cYes! It was him!\u201d A cold killing light started to spread within her eyes. She moved around, trying to find some trace of him. She started to study the leaves and branches, trying to figure out whether he had left or not.Before, if Shi Yan tried to escape, he would have broken some branches of the tree, or left behind some heavy and messy footprints. In that short time, there was no way for him to cover his tracks.Mo Yanyu was right about that.But what a shame! Shi Yan hadn\u2019t left at all. He had been hiding in that ancient tree all along. Mo Yanyu searched everywhere, but couldn\u2019t find a thing. Her beautiful face held an ugly frown, \u201cDamn it! Fucking hell! There is no trace of him at all!\u201dAfter Master Karu arrived, he looked around with his shrewd eyes and suddenly looked up and shouted, \u201cYou little shit! Come out of the tree now! You think you can get away with this again?\u201dShi Yan was surprised by Master Karu\u2019s reaction. He couldn\u2019t help but lose his control. A freezing light flew out of his dark eyes, the killing desire that he had been suppressed inside of his body was unleashed!\u201cThere you are!\u201d Master Karu sneered and instantly summoned a creepy grey bomb in his hands. The bomb was suddenly thrown towards Shi Yan\u2019s hiding place in a flash.\u201cYou fucking asshole! Where can you hide this time?\u201d Mo Yanyu put on a scary face and also struck the place where Shi Yan was hiding with her powerful [Green Lightning Kill], mixed with beams of electricity.\u201cWhoo!\u201dShi Yan jumped out of the leaves. He didn\u2019t lay eyes on Mo Yanyu or Master Karu at all. Once he was out, he instantly ran for the next tree with the thickest leaves.However, both Mo Yanyu and Master Karu were Warriors of the Nascent Realm, which was superior to Shi Yan\u2019s Elementary Realm. Unless Shi Yan attacked them by surprise, there was no way that Shi Yan could confront them face to face, to say nothing of one versus the two of them.\u201cDon\u2019t lose him!\u201d With a loud shout, Mo Yanyu flew after Shi Yan, while the two warriors of the Mo family followed behind.Master Karu didn\u2019t chase Shi Yan instantly. He watched the grey bomb completely destroy the tree branches where Shi Yan had been hiding, waved his hand, and summoned that creepy grey bomb back into his palm. He sneered again and then followed Mo Yanyu at the speed of light.The two warriors of the Mo family were soon left behind. Mo Yanyu and Master Karu were chasing Shi Yan one after another. They were soon closing in.\u201cBoom!\u201dA bright blue light ball suddenly exploded right in front of Mo Yanyu and Master Karu, with the shining blue light almost blinding the two of them. Mo Yanyu and Master Karu were too busy following Shi Yan to pay attention to their surroundings, and were instantly surprised and blinded by the shining flash of the blue light. They collided into two giant trees. Before they could regain their eyesight, Shi Yan was already miles away.\u201cA blue smoke bomb! Damn it!\u201d Mo Yanyu shouted and continued to chase Shi Yan with an angry face.Master Karu was apparently irritated too. He swore something and suddenly flew ahead of Mo Yanyu. This time, he was not holding back his real power. \u201cFucking asshole! This time, I\u2019m gonna make you beg for mercy!\u201d\u201cBoom!\u201dAnother blue smoke bomb exploded in front of him. But this time, Master Karu was prepared. He closed his eyes just in time and continued to chase Shi Yan after the bright flash of that blue smoke bomb faded away.As a Warrior of the Nascent Realm, Master Karu\u2019s power was way above that of Shi Yan\u2019s. He flew just like a wind, as fast as lightning. After the second blue smoke bomb, he soon closed the gap between him and Shi Yan.The grey bomb! Master Karu summoned another grey bomb inside his palm. He put on an evil face and lifted his hands when he was about 20 meters away from Shi Yan. Boom! That grey bomb was cast out just like a cannonball, heading straight at the back of Shi Yan.\u201cBoom!\u201dShi Yan released another blue smoke bomb. The blue smoke bomb and that grey bomb crashed into each other and exploded, releasing bright green light which covered the whole sky. The green light fell onto the forest and started a wildfire.Thanks to that blue smoke bomb, Shi Yan had won some time to escape. He kept running like hell. Once he sensed that Master Karu was closing in on him, he would release a blue smoke bomb that he had taken from the warriors before, and buy himself some time to run away.But finally, Shi Yan had run out of all the blue smoke bombs in his hands. At that moment, he suddenly felt a strange warm stream of energy flowing throughout his body from his meridians. The Profound Qi he had extracted from those two dead warriors had been purified by his body and become part of his own Profound Qi within his abdomen, enhancing his power to the next level.Instantly, Shi Yan turned around, and started running towards Master Karu as if he were crazy!Master Karu put a creepy sneer on his face again. He did not panic at all. He slowly operated the Profound Qi inside his body, preparing his plan. Within seconds, his whole body was covered with a layer of dark light, half a metre thick.He was using Profound Qi to protect his body!Shi Yan was a little shocked, but he didn\u2019t slow down because of this. Even with his Profound Qi concentrated within his left hand, Shi Yan didn\u2019t release it up front. He held his iron-like fist like a sharp knife, and stuck it right at Master Karu\u2019s stomach.With the look of contempt in his eyes, Master Karu didn\u2019t move at all, as if he was waiting for Shi Yan\u2019s strike.\u201cBoom!\u201dWith one hit on the layer of dark light covering Master Karu\u2019s body, Shi Yan felt like he was hitting a layer of cotton. He only hit the layer of dark light, he could not hurt Master Karu\u2019s body at all.\u201cHmph! You low-grade Elementary Realm Warrior! Wanna break my [Dark Light Shield]? It\u2019s not that easy!\u201d Master Karu sneered, and with a wave, a grey bomb sped out of his palms, right at Shi Yan\u2019s chest.Shi Yan was struck instantly. With an intense wave of power storming into his chest, Shi Yan flew backwards, his mouth filled with blood. He could even hear the sound of his bones crushing inside his chest.Falling on the ground, Shi Yan felt like his whole body had shattered, and felt an unbearable pain all over. His mouth was filled with blood.\u201cYou have no idea who you are dealing with,\u201d Master Karu shook his head, and slowly walked towards Shi Yan with a dark face, \u201cYou boy, come back to be my medicine slave. Don\u2019t ever attempt to run away again. You should know that I didn\u2019t strike you with my full power. Otherwise, you would have been dead already.\u201d\u201cAgain!\u201dShi Yan stood up. He wiped the blood from his lips, and rushed towards Master Karu again with a terrifying look in his eyes.\u201cHmm! You wanna die? Sure!\u201d Master Karu laughed like crazy. This time, he didn\u2019t hide either, and activated his [Dark Light Shield] again. His entire body was instantly covered by a shining dark light.Shi Yan held up his right fist and rushed towards Master Karu, as if he wanted to try the same attack as last time. Master Karu sneered, \u201cCome on boy, you are certainly looking for death this time!\u201dAs Shi Yan was rushing forward, something strange suddenly happened to his right hand. Before he hit Master Karu\u2019s [Dark Light Shield], a layer of white light appeared around his right fist. A strong wave of negative energy, combined with desperation, fear and a killing lust, rushed out together instantly.Master Karu became anxious. However, it was already too late for him to make any contingency plans.The next moment, a terrifying storm of horrifying negative desires, filled with craziness and desperation, struck Master Karu\u2019s [Dark Light Shield]. The [Dark Light Shield], that was more than capable of defending from a full strength strike from an Elementary Realm Warrior, shattered into pieces within seconds. The evil spirits entangled around Shi Yan\u2019s right fist smashed right through Master Karu\u2019s body, storming through into his body like a wild wave.Under the influence of that overwhelming killing power, Master Karu\u2019s mind, as well as his body, was completely frozen. He had absolutely no time to react or prepare his defense.Shi Yan took out the dagger that he had been hiding in his left sleeve and swiped right across Master Karu\u2019s neck. A hot wave of blood streamed out of Karu\u2019s neck, splashing all over Shi Yan\u2019s body.A head flew up into the air and fell onto the ground three meters away.The Profound Qi inside Master Karu\u2019s body was now running wild. Mixed with all those terrifying thoughts inside Master Karu\u2019s mind right before his last breath, his Profound Qi was now flowing into Shi Yan\u2019s meridians with an unstoppable force.Shi Yan could clearly feel the strong energy within this unique wave of Profound Qi. His whole body trembled slightly with excitement.Different from previous warriors like Zheng Tie, Master Karu was a Nascent Realm Warrior. The Profound Qi inside his body was much thicker and more concentrated. The Profound Qi that Shi Yan got from him after his death was way more powerful than what he got from the previous warriors. Shi Yan was standing still. He couldn\u2019t move at all. It took him almost a minute to absorb all the Profound Qi inside Master Karu\u2019s body.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter taking off the only bag that Master Karu had on him, Shi Yan felt like his whole body was aching, as if he had lost all the power in his arms and legs, especially his right arm, which he had used for his previous attacks. He couldn\u2019t use any strength in his right arm, as if this was the consequence he had to face after such an intense attack which had caused some backlash in his body.\u201cDon\u2019t let him get away!\u201dNot far behind, he could hear the shouting and screaming of Mo Yanyu. Although the several blue smoke bombs Shi Yan had set off had successfully slowed her down, she had managed to catch up after a couple of minutes.It seemed that she wasn\u2019t alone. Chasing along with her, were a few warriors from the Mo family.At the moment, Shi Yan could feel that some energy within his body was caged for the moment, so he didn\u2019t want to fight against Mo Yanyu or those warriors directly. Shi Yan took Master Karu\u2019s backpack, jumped into the thick bushes, and started running like hell once again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, the corpse had already been deprived of all its Profound Qi, and lay there dry as a mummy.Looking at the scene, all four warriors stood by Mo Yanyu\u2019s side with terror in their eyes. One of them came up to Mo Yanyu after some hesitation, and said \u201cMiss Mo\u2026\u201dMo Yanyu was trembling. After a while, she replied with a frown, \u201cStop the chase.\u201d\u201cBut Miss\u2026\u201d The warrior wanted to add something.\u201cMaster Karu had already achieved the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm, the same level as me. Moreover, he had far more fighting experience than me.\u201d Mo Yanyu shook her head with a hopeless look, \u201cI don\u2019t know how he killed Master Karu. But this means that he is capable of killing any of us right now. If we keep chasing him, we probably won\u2019t even be able to make it back to the Merchant Union.\u201d\u201cSo we just let him go like this? Miss Mo, we have spent a lot of money in order to get Master Karu to work for us!\u201d That warrior said in a low voice.\u201cSo Li Tian, if we don\u2019t give up, can you come up with a better idea?\u201dThat warrior suddenly went silent.Mo Yanyu kneeled down beside the cold corpse of Master Karu. She searched through his body and cursed in a low voice, \u201cShit! That bastard has taken everything from Master Karu, all the medicine and medical books. This time we are literally here for nothing.\u201dAll the other four warriors went silent together; they didn\u2019t dare to say anything.\u201cGo back to Johnson! From now on, we must act in groups. No individual movement is allowed!\u201d Mo Yanyu took a deep breath. Then, she stood up and turned back to the way they came. From that moment, she hated Shi Yan\u2019s guts.\u2026On the other side, Shi Yan was still running for his life in the Dark Forest.The bloodthirst was still running wild inside his body. It was devouring his consciousness bit by bit. The negative energy of madness, brutality and bloodthirst was invading his mind uncontrollably. Gradually, his sight blacked out and his body felt on the verge of a breakdown from the wild energy.At that moment, he was extremely weak and tired. He couldn\u2019t gather any strength in his arms or legs. He must avoid a fight with anyone. Otherwise, he would be dead for sure.Shi Yan wasn\u2019t sure how long he could hold on. He never expected his body to react in such a strange way, so he had made no contingency plans.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe wild bloodthirst inside his mind finally exploded. Shi Yan was panting heavily as he totally lost his sight. There was only one voice in his head, whispering, repeating the same word, \u201cKill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!\u201dShi Yan knew that before long, he will have lost all his sanity, and become a mindless bloodthirsty beast. He would be filled with the intent to kill.A beautiful music suddenly flew into Shi Yan\u2019s ears from a distance. The music was like water drops falling onto a jade plate, like the wind shuttling through a silk curtain. It was as soft as a bird flapping its wings, as light as a gentle stream flowing through a quiet forest. The music was so beautiful, so peaceful, as if it flew down from Heaven.The beautiful music was like a soft hand soothing his heart. It had taken away all his bloody and crazy desire. Slowly, it also helped Shi Yan regain his sanity, which was on the brink of breakdown.Thanks to that soft and soothing music, Shi Yan gradually regained his sanity before he lost his mind. He slowly walked in the direction of that music with an intoxicated look on his face. He felt like his whole body was soaking in that beautiful music, and all the bloodlust inside his body had totally disappeared.In a small valley full of unique flowers and special plants, Shi Yan saw a beautiful figure playing the zither. She was just sitting cross-legged in the middle of the flowers. She slightly lowered her head and was completely putting herself into the music, unaware of Shi Yan\u2019s presence.Shi Yan moved closer and closer and stopped around 100 meters away from her back. He stood there and was flabbergasted with the beautiful figure in front of him. He stood there with closed eyes, trying to immerse himself in the beautiful sound of zither.After a while, the sound of zither gradually slowed down, and finally stopped.Shi Yan felt awakened from a pleasant dream. He found that his anger and bloodlust were completely gone, as if they had never existed!However, his body still felt heavy. The intense pain in his chest was especially intense. It seemed that he was still suffering from that blow from Master Karu. Shi Yan concentrated his attention and could feel the flowing Profound Qi within his meridians. He could sense that his body was still processing the Profound Qi that he had absorbed from Master Karu.The beautiful figure at distance slowly turned around with an ancient zither in her hands. She slightly frowned and looked straight at Shi Yan.Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help but tremble. His eyes were staring at the beautiful girl in front of him unceasingly. \u201cSo beautiful!\u201d He unconsciously blurted out.That girl was around 18 or 19 years old, dressed in a white overskirt. Her eyes were sparkling, her teeth were gleaming, her skin was soft and smooth, and her figure was delicate and slim. She could be described as a beautiful goddess from Heaven, but at the same time, also as the cute girl that lived next door. She was so perfect. Shi Yan couldn\u2019t tell who was more beautiful, Mo Yanyu, or the girl in front of him.The lovely girl gave Shi Yan a single glance. She then turned around in silence and walked slowly towards the little creek hundreds of meters away with the zither in her hands.Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help admiring the beautiful women in this world. Overall, he had only met two women in this world, but they were both so breathtaking, like one in a million.\u201cMiss! Thanks a lot for your beautiful music. Can I\u2026\u201d Seeing the girl was walking away from him, Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help but shout.\u201cHey, stop it! Enough is enough.\u201dSuddenly, a strong figure jumped from the giant ancient tree in front of Shi Yan. It was a middle-aged man with a hairy yellow face. He was wearing a grey-brown warrior\u2019s outfit. He looked very tall and strong with a huge sword on his shoulder. But he didn\u2019t look very serious, just standing in front of Shi Yan, looking at him with a weird smile on his face.No doubt, Shi Yan was caught off guard. He instantly put on alert. Just by looking at him, he could clearly sense a terrifying energy from this yellow-faced man in front of him.It didn\u2019t take him long to understand that this yellow-faced man was definitely a warrior way above his level. The yellow-faced man was just looking at him, not intentionally releasing any energy to pressure him at all, but Shi Yan already felt like he was as untouchable as a steady mountain.Shi Yan took a step back, showing that he didn\u2019t come with any evil thoughts. Then he faked a smile and said, \u201cThe music that the beautiful miss played was so enchanting. I just can\u2019t get enough. I stayed just to listen to more of her music, nothing else. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dTo Shi Yan, this girl had the most magical music skills. Her beautiful music could apparently help him control the bloody desire within his mind. Shi Yan was not sure when this craving for blood inside of him would come back again. Therefore, he was desperate to find something to help him control this ugly desire inside him body.\u201cI can tell that you are just a lustful guy, nothing else. Otherwise, I wouldn\u2019t have let you live until now.\u201d The yellow-faced man laughed, and said in a relaxed mood, \u201cBut here is not the place for you to be lustful. I suggest you get the hell away from us. Otherwise you will be in a lot of trouble.\u201d\u201cOK, as you wish.\u201d Shi Yan lifted both hands to show cooperation. He didn\u2019t stay any longer. However, he took a glance at that beautiful figure in distance before turning around and leaving.\u2026\u201cUncle Luo, I sensed a strong evil spirit in that man. Back then, his whole body was filled with a killing desire and he almost went berserk. However, after his bloodlust faded away, he dared to take such a lustful look at me. I guess he shouldn\u2019t belong to the Dark World.\u201d Mu Yu Die said with mild discomfort when she recalled Shi Yan\u2019s lustful look at her.That man\u2026 it seemed that he could never hide his desire from within.Although there were other men who also wanted her, they would at least do it in secret or cover up their desires when they laid eyes on her. They wouldn\u2019t expose their dirty thoughts to the world. However, that guy\u2026 he didn\u2019t even try to cover up his lust for her in his eyes. What she saw in his eyes was a simple and straight-forward desire.\u201cHe can\u2019t be from the Dark World. The assassins sent by the Dark World were all Warriors of the Nascent Realm, but that guy was still an Elementary Realm Warrior.\u201d Luo Hao laughed and said, \u201cBut interesting though, that guy was not even a Nascent Realm Warrior, but dare to dream about our beautiful princess who has already achieved the Third Sky. This guy has some balls. Haha!\u201d\u201cAh, I am still not sure when I can recover. Currently, I am powerless.\u201d Mu Yu Die slightly sighed with her heart filled with sorrow, \u201cUncle Luo, if the assassins did come and you couldn\u2019t defeat them, please just leave me behind. I\u2026 can rely on myself.\u201d\u201cWhat is this nonsense?!\u201d Hearing this, Luo Hao was apparently not very happy. He said with a firm voice, \u201cWe are not far away from the Merchant Union right now. If we can survive the next few weeks, one month at most, we can definitely get out of this Dark Forest. Once we reach the Merchant Union, the Dark World can\u2019t do anything to hurt us.\u201d\u201cGu! Gu!\u201dWith a strange whistle from the distance. Before long, two men and a woman who dressed like a mercenary came out of the forest with a heavy look. The leader came up to Luo Hao and said, \u201cSorry Uncle Luo, we couldn\u2019t keep up with the trackers from the Dark World.\u201dLuo Hao nodded, and said with a frown, \u201cWe must set out right now and choose a new location to rest. Otherwise, the assassins from the Dark World will soon find and surround us.\u201dThe five of them did not stay for long. They quickly packed their stuff and left in a hurry.\u2026Right after Shi Yan left the girl, the craving for blood slowly rose up again in his mind.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis unstoppable desire for blood may have something to do with the Profound Qi that Shi Yan got from Master Karu. Because Master Karu had the power of a Nascent Realm Warrior, his Profound Qi was mixed with too much negative energy. Therefore, it would take Shi Yan much more time and effort to purify his Profound Qi. While his meridians were processing Master Karu\u2019s Profound Qi, these annoying negative energies would spill over from time to time and ignite his crazy desire for blood from inside his body.But that girl\u2019s music could help him control those wild desires, so he didn\u2019t lose his sanity and fall into an abyss of craziness and chaos back then. However, his meridians were still working on purifying Master Karu\u2019s Profound Qi. Until this process was completed, there was a pretty good chance that Shi Yan would fall into that bloody, crazy state again.Before his body finished the purification of Master Karu\u2019s Profound Qi, that beautiful girl could definitely be his cure to stay sane.Knowing that another bloody urge was slowly creeping up on him, Shi Yan was overwhelmed by a bad feeling. After some hesitation, he still started walking towards that girl\u2019s direction.Only the beautiful music of that girl could help him to calm down. And only by following her steps, could Shi Yan get the chance to hear that Heaven-like sound again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked like 25-26 years old, and was already 1.85 meters tall, with a strong and slim figure. He was a Nascent realm Warrior who had already reached the Third Sky. His eyes were shining with energy and was always on alert. Just from a simple glance, Shi Yan knew that he was an excellent warrior.\u201cNo, he is not from the Dark World. He is just a horny little stalker; so shameless. No need to pay attention to him.\u201d Luo Hao shook his head, and said with a frown, \u201cLet\u2019s hurry. Just leave him alone.\u201dZhao Xin didn\u2019t look happy about this, and said with a cold voice, \u201cIs he after Miss Mu? How dare he! Shall I wait here to teach him a lesson?\u201d While he was talking, he gave a caring look at the delicate girl named Mu Yu Die, who was leaning on Luo Hao.\u201cNo, don\u2019t make any trouble if it\u2019s not necessary.\u201d Luo Hao shook his head again, and asked the girl in a soft voice, \u201cDie, are you ok with this? Shall we speed up a little bit?\u201dMu Yu Die was looking very pale, and was perspiring heavily. She smiled politely, \u201cYes, I can hold on. We could go faster. Maybe it would be better if we leave that man behind. Otherwise, he will also be killed by those assassins sent by the Dark World.\u201dLuo Hao couldn\u2019t help but sigh, feeling pity for this kind-hearted girl. He nodded to her and said, \u201cDie, don\u2019t use any more of your Profound Qi. I am here for you to lean on.\u201dAfter saying that, Luo Hao held the shoulders of Mu Yu Die as if she were a delicate flower, and ran between the trees in the forest with ease. When he was about to land on the ground, he would control his mighty body to just slightly touch the ground before jumping up again. There were no footprints left behind him. Obviously, he was a first-class master at manoeuvering his Profound Qi.\u2026On the other side, Shi Yan was struggling very hard with such a march. It was becoming more and more difficult for him to breathe.The desire for blood had been killing him all the way. His body was also aching from the intense blow from Master Karu. Due to the intense fight he just had, Shi Yan suffered a severe loss of Profound Qi, which couldn\u2019t be restored within a short period of time.Under these circumstances, if he ever encountered Mo Yanyu again, there was no doubt that he would be dead. Therefore, he had no choice but to recover as soon as possible and control his own body which had gone wild.The beautiful music of that girl was indeed his only hope.He didn\u2019t care whether that girl liked him or not. Shi Yan felt like he didn\u2019t have a choice. Even if she thought that he was a shameless bastard, let it be! He would always follow her steps, as long as she would play that enchanting music again.Shi Yan tried to control his growing urge for murder and had an evil look on his face, Shi Yan moved most of his Profound Qi, which was not much, to his legs, and tried his best to keep up with the five people ahead of him.Shi Yan completely cleared his mind and became more focused than ever. The only goal that he had in his mind was to keep up with those people. Once he cleared his thoughts, he felt this march not as hard as before.\u2026\u201cUncle Luo, I cannot believe that guy was just an Elementary Realm Warrior!\u201d In midst of their rapid movement, Zhao Xin suddenly said with surprise.Luo Hao was also wondering. According to his knowledge, a warrior of the Elementary Realm shouldn\u2019t be able to keep up with their speed. Although they had successfully distanced themselves from the man behind, they never managed to ditch him. That man must have some endurance to keep him chasing all the way. This made Luo Hao a little curious, making him wonder whether he had underestimated this warrior the previous time they met.\u201cUncle Luo, I can keep up. You could speed up a little.\u201d Mu Yu Die said with pain and a layer of sweat on her face.\u201cNo, if we go any faster, you would get hurt.\u201d Luo Hao stubbornly refused He said in a low voice with a frown, \u201cDon\u2019t pay too much attention to the man behind. He is looking for death. If he dies, it is not our fault.\u201d\u201cAwwoo!\u201dAs they spoke, a loud roaring as horrifying as that of a wild beast came from behind, which was apparently from Shi Yan. However, that roaring didn\u2019t sound human at all. It was filled with craziness and an evil craving for blood and killing, making anybody who had heard it tremble inside.\u201cIs this guy human or not?!\u201d The hot female mercenary named Di Yalan couldn\u2019t help but tremble, and said with a scared look in her eyes, \u201cHow could any human make such a terrifying sound? This is even more terrifying than the roaring of a demon beast that had gone crazy.\u201d\u201cThe crazy craving inside his body is eating him up again.\u201d Luo Hao started to look nervous, and said quickly, \u201cStay away from him! Otherwise, he might attack us. He has already gone crazy. It\u2019s not very difficult to kill him, but it might waste our precious time to escape. The unnecessary fight will certainly draw the attention of those Dark World\u2019s assassins, and we would be in a lot of trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cJust let me help him. Otherwise he will become a crazy monster that only knows to kill, and would start a bloody war in this dark forest.\u201d Mu Yu Die said after a little hesitation, and unwrapped the zither that she had been carrying. Despite the dissuasion of Luo Hao and the other warriors, she sat down with her legs crossed and started to play a song.Luo Hao stepped hard on the ground with anger, \u201cHe is such a bastard! He is not at all worthy of your help!\u201dThe mesmerising sound of the zither flowed through the Dark Forest like a gentle stream, right towards Shi Yan, as if it was specifically meant for him.With both of his eyes turning crimson, Shi Yan was on the brink of going crazy, almost losing to that murderous rage. Hearing the familiar music, he was suddenly awakened. With a light flashing through his eyes, he just stood there like completely lost in that beautiful music.A trace of the negative energy combined with desperation and fear slowly drifted out of his body and started to surround him like a light mist. It felt like millions of tornados in each of his seven hundred and twenty meridians and he could feel the unique energy that he got from Master Karu being purified and concentrated over and over again.After a while, Shi Yan\u2019s eyes gradually returned to normal, and he began to regain the look of a sane man. At that moment, he realized that this was all due to the generous help of that beautiful girl. She had saved him again!With deep gratitude in his heart, Shi Yan sat down right where he was. He put his heart and soul into this beautiful music and started to operate his Profound Qi inside his body without a second thoughts. Immersing in this soothing music, he started to relax.Right in the middle of this dark forest, filled with all kinds of unexpected danger, Shi Yan managed to enter the world of the Selfless State.He didn\u2019t remember how long it took before he awoke. The mist wrapping around him had already been absorbed into his own body, and under his guidance, flew through the different meridians inside his body.Suddenly, thousands of warm but strange streams of energy spilled over from all the meridians in his body and started to propel his Profound Qi through his veins.Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help but tremble. He could clearly feel his Profound Qi compressing and strengthening with an amazing speed!Within seconds, he could feel his Profound Qi became five or six times stronger, and it was more concentrated than before!His strengthened Profound Qi suddenly started to gather in his abdomen, and filled his entire body with power. Realizing that he must have finally purified all the Profound Qi that he got from Master Karu, Shi Yan was overwhelmed.Shi Yan slowed his breathing and concentrated all his energy in operating all his Profound Qi towards his twelve Major Veins and eight Special Veins.The Profound Qi stormed through his entire body like a raging flood. Shi Yan was able to unblock all his congested veins, albeit suffering from intense pain. He felt as if his shoulders were finally able to relax.Now that his Profound Qi had become stronger than ever, he felt like he had unlimited potential.The sun had already set, and the moon was shining brightly in the starry sky.With the last of his veins cleared, Shi Yan was very excited. He was trying very hard to contain his exuberance, while operating the Profound Qi in a cycle throughout the body.When his cycle was finally over, Shi Yan felt like he was waking up from a very long dream. He looked up at all the shining stars in the sky, feeling nothing but unparalleled happiness.Now that he had broken through all the veins in his body, he could be said to have promoted to the Nascent Realm.From the Profound Qi that he got from Master Karu, and through the incidents when he almost lost his mind and went crazy with bloodlust, he had finally purified all the power he got from Master Karu and broke through all his veins with the newly purified and concentrated Profound Qi. Now he had finally entered into a whole new level!After purification of all the energy he got from Master Karu, the bloodlust that had once tangled his mind had suddenly vanished.Now that he thought about it, Shi Yan realized that every time after absorbing the Profound Qi from the dead, and until the Profound Qi was completely purified by his meridians, there would always be some negative energy spilling over from his meridians, which would trigger the darker side of himself and drive him into a state of insanity.Because the first few victims of him were just Elementary Realm Warriors with moderate energy, he could still control the negative desires.But Master Karu was a Nascent Realm Warrior, with the power far beyond Shi Yan\u2019s league. There was too much negative energy within Master Karu\u2019s Profound Qi. Therefore, that time Shi Yan couldn\u2019t control the negative energy, and almost lost his sanity.Right now, since he had fully purified the Profound Qi that he got from Master Karu and entered a completely new level, Shi Yan didn\u2019t need to worry about the eruption of the evil power anymore.\u201cKaka!\u201dShi Yan stretched his body a little and stood up slowly. He was feeling completely refreshed. The broken bones in his chest also seemed to have recovered.Shi Yan checked his body for wounds, but found them all healed. This made him extremely happy.He knew that his speedy recovery was not only due to his promotion, but also had something to do with his Immortal Martial Spirit.Right before losing himself to the music, he had felt the cells near his chest wounds repairing and beginning to heal.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLooking around, Shi Yan realized that the location he was in was completely exposed, with no tree cover or shade. Realizing that he had been operating his Profound Qi here, forgetting everything around him, Shi Yan felt lucky that nothing unexpected had happened to him.By practicing his Profound Qi in such an exposed location, had Mo Yanyu still been looking for him, he would have definitely been captured by her.At present, that mesmerising music was long gone. He remembered the sky was still bright when fell under the effects of music, however, now it was already midnight. He must have been practicing for a long time without realizing. He felt immense gratitude towards that beautiful girl. She had saved him more than once. The first time she might have saved him unintentionally, but the second time, it was specifically for himBased on the discussion he overheard from the five people, Shi Yan realized that they were being chased by someone. However, he didn\u2019t think too much and decided to continue following them.He didn\u2019t like owing favors, and so he decided to pay back the girl\u2019s kindness in his own way.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Every time she remembered the cold decisiveness in Shi Yan\u2019s eyes, she became restless. How she wished she could catch him and ruin his veins and bones.Given Master Karu\u2019s death, she had already released the medicine slaves who were of no use now.With her were eleven warriors from the Mo family who were only of the Elementary Realm. Their power was insufficient to help Mo Yanyu search for Shi Yan. As such, she could only wait for the relief troops from the family.All of a sudden, a pale blue light shot up across the sky some five miles ahead.\u201cThey have arrived!\u201d Mo Yanyu\u2019s spirit rose. She immediately threw the blue smoke bomb up into the sky, and thus the same pale blue light was seen above her.The warriors around the Ground Dragon rejoiced with a lively outburst of happiness as if they were getting ready for a fight.In less than a quarter of an hour, three dark shadows showed up from afar and flew in their direction. The first of them had a graceful beard and wore an indifferent smile. He approached near Mo Yanyu and laughed loudly. \u201cYanyu, where is Master Karu?\u201d\u201cThird uncle, Master Karu is dead.\u201d Mo Yanyu explained in a very unwilling manner, \u201cWe met a thief mid-way. He was only Elementary ranked, but he still was able to kill Master Karu. I just can\u2019t figure it out.\u201dMo Chaoge\u2019s smile disappeared at once and his face turned pale: \u201cHave you got the thing that was on Karu?\u201dMo Yan Yu shook her head, \u201cIt was taken by that thief.\u201d\u201cStupid!\u201dMo Chaoge cursed in a low voice. With a cold face, he observed: \u201cWe received information that Karu had stolen an incomplete picture of the \u2018Gate of Heaven\u2019 from his teacher. His teacher, Mu Xun, is looking for him everywhere for that incomplete picture. It is said, in the God Area where the Gate of Heaven leads to, are Martial Skills of the Spirit and even Sacred level! I came here in a hurry with two escorts just for that incomplete picture! But you let him die! How stupid!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d Mo Yan Yu was shocked, \u201cHow could that be!\u201d\u201cWhy would Karu leave Medicine Valley with you if he hadn\u2019t stolen that valuable map from his teacher? You think he was attracted by the wealth of Mo family? Humph. He was attempting to get shelter in the Merchant Union, so that his teacher Mu Xun couldn\u2019t kill him. \u201dMo Chaoge thought for a second seriously and reproached, \u201cTell me the details. That man must be still in the Dark Forest. We have to find him! The picture means a lot. We, the Mo family, have to get it! \u201dMo Yanyu started to realize how bad the situation was. She told him all the details, except that she was violated by Shi Yan twice.\u201cDumbass!\u201d Mo Chaoge scolded again. He flew into a rage, \u201cYou didn\u2019t keep tracking him? That bastard is only of the Elementary Realm! No matter how he killed Karu, he must have paid a significant price. He might have been hurt too. If you had chased him you could have killed him easily! Too dumb!\u201d\u201cI was afraid that we would lose more, so\u2026\u201dMo Yanyu lowered her head in shame.\u201cAn Elementary Realm guy, and you were afraid of him?\u201d Mo Chaoge was annoyed, \u201cYou wasted so many resources of our Mo family! What are you doing now? Show me the way! You! You! You! Bring the Ground Dragon back to the Merchant Union through the secure route. Others! Follow me and search!\u201d\u2014They looked for Shi Yan for two days but still found nothing.Under the moonlight, Shi Yan was leaning against an ancient tree and deep in thought. He had decided to stop the chase for the time being.He took off Karu\u2019s bag from his back and opened it to look into the contents.Inside the bag was a volume on poisons, several bottles of poison refined by Karu, and two Mortal level Martial Skill books: [Dark Light Shield] and [Black Formula].Apart from those things, there a dark yellow, incomplete picture, on which were painted two hills. Shi Yan studied it for two days but found nothing, so he didn\u2019t take it seriously.Of the two Martial Skills, to train [Black Formula], required a collection of Black Qi first. Thinking hard for two days, Shi Yan didn\u2019t come up with any idea of where he could find Black Qi, and so he soon forgot about it.Fortunately, the other Martial Skill, [Dark Light Shield], didn\u2019t require anything special. One simply needed to operate his Profound Qi according to the meridian map.Shi Yan took out the book on [Dark Light Shield] from the bag and started to train in it. He was determined to learn that skill and thus made every effort in remembering the mnemonics of the skill.[Dark Light Shield] was a defensive Martial Skill. It used Profound Qi to form a layer of dark light around one\u2019s body in order to defend from an enemy\u2019s assault. It was just a Mortal level Martial Skill and needed no requirements but one; the flow of Profound Qi.Shi Yan packed the bag and observed the surroundings for a while. Assured that it was safe, he quietly climbed up a tree behind him, hid himself in the thickets, and started to train the [Dark Light Shield].After reaching the Nascent Realm, his veins were as smooth as silk. Once he thought of moving his Profound Qi, it would immediately flow into the veins.Sitting in meditation, Shi Yan operated his Profound Qi quietly and trained according to the meridian map for [Dark Light Shield].The Profound Qi flew around his body like a gentle stream in a controlled manner. At once, Shi Yan sped up the circulation of his Profound Qi.\u201cPump!\u201dSuddenly a hazy black light started emitting from Shi Yan. It gradually started forming a layer over his whole body. Shi Yan was quite sure that he was training in the correct way, so he once again accelerated the Profound Qi.The black light emitting his body began to grow in intensity. At first it was only half a metre, then it formed a one metre thick layer, exactly the same as Karu\u2019s.A long time passed. Shi Yan exhaled a mixed breath and opened his eyes leisurely. The Profound Qi in him had already finished six big circulations.Success!Shi Yan smiled. He found that it was very easy to train in the [Dark Light Shield].In merely one night, he had grasped the essential part of this Martial Skill. With his Profound Qi growing, he only needed to accelerate its circulation and his defense would increase greatly.Up in the sky. The moon had disappeared. Dawn was coming near.Shi Yan was not in a hurry to leave. He calmed his mind and tried to operate the Profound Qi for a second time. The Profound Qi flew toward his left arm. Once it arrived at the first meridian, Shi Yan had another thought and his Profound Qi promptly started rotating in that meridian.After three breaths, Shi Yan changed his mind again. Immediately, the Profound Qi flew backwards and he felt a splitting pain in that vein!It\u2019s was the phenomenon that occurred while training [Rampage].Enduring the pain in his arm, Shi Yan continued to circulate his Profound Qi. He tried again as he according the process he previously followed in his right arm.The muscles in the left arm began to contract, and slowly became dry and thin. Thin white fog was coming out of his left arm\u2026In the white fog was a mix of negative feelings such as fear, cruelty and despair, which had the weird power of bewildering people\u2019s minds. The negative feelings sourced from the meridians in the left arm and were temporarily bound by the fog. Once he fought with others, they would leak out of his arm directly.The sun was hanging high in the sky.Shi Yan was sweating all over while fully concentrating on his left arm. His left arm was covered with a heavy fog which was sending out a putrid smell. Shi Yan was then filled with a desire for murder.\u201cHooo, hooo\u2026\u201dShi Yan was trying very hard to control his desire. He withdrew the Profound Qi in his arm little by little, back into his abdomen. Therefore, his arm gradually went back to normal, and the white fog around it began to drift back into his meridians through his veins, till none of it remained around his arm.Shi Yan leaned against the tree trunk with a deathly pale face. Exhausted, he was drowned in mixed feelings.This Martial Skill [Rampage] was able to induce all the negative energy in his meridians, though the negative energy would also disturb his mind. This Martial Skill was a double-edged sword in battle, which would make him lose his mind. It did bring a warrior enormous power, but it was at the same time very dangerous.Nevertheless, Shi Yan remembered when [Rampage] broke Karu\u2019s [Dark Light Shield], and the odd state of Karu when his brain was invaded by the negative energy. Shi Yan thus made up his mind to train this vicious Martial Skill with his whole body. He wanted to know what would happen to his body when all the negative power within his all meridians was induced.He had this vague thought that as long as he finished training the first sky of [Rampage], his body would have a major shift and that his strength would surge by two times.\u201cShoo! Shoo! Shoo!\u201d There came a sound of someone approaching from afar.Shi Yan frowned, and slowed his breathing. He then started observing his surroundings.Not before long, seven shadows, each of whom were wearing a grey gown and a pale mask, stopped under the ancient tree, seeming to be waiting for something.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euOn the shoulders of six of those seven men, were signs of silver stars, while on the last one\u2019s shoulder, was a sign of silver crescent.\u201cWooon! Woon!\u201d A weird sound came from the grove ahead, sounding like a communication signal.Under the ancient tree, the tall, thin man with the crescent on his shoulder had a cold look in his eyes. He listened to the surroundings for five seconds and remarked, \u201cAccording to the secret message, they have been spotted in a valley twenty miles away. Now chase after them!\u201dThe troop of seven people passed rapidly.Ten seconds after they left, Shi Yan stuck his head out of the leaves. After thinking for a while, he jumped down the tree and followed after them secretly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If you go against us, you are bringing about your own destruction!\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201d Luo Hao burst into laughter. His voice was resonant. \u201cI\u2019m always alone. To kill me, you Dark World would have to pay a lot. You are a Dark Moon emissary of the Dark World, with the power of the Second Sky of the Disaster Realm. It\u2019s enough to bring you with me when I die!\u201d\u201cDo you think you even deserve that type of death?!\u201d That emissary shook his head, and vanished into thin air.The next moment, he was standing three metres in front of Luo Hao. He stretched out his left hand, his five fingers shaped like a claw; between them glowed a ghost-like green light, which suddenly flew toward Luo Hao, and started to twine about him like a ribbon.\u201cThe [Green Claw]!\u201d Luo Hao\u2019s facial expression changed a bit. He uttered calmly, \u201cZhao Xin, you three! Protect Die!\u201d\u201cBoom boom boom!\u201dLuo Hao\u2019s heart was beating several times faster than before! Around him, the power of gravity surged ten times!All of a sudden, the eight men surrounding Luo Hao\u2019s group felt an immense pressure, as if they were being pressed down by a huge mountain. The pressure almost made them kneel on the ground. Even the Crescent emissary was affected. However, he grunted and said, \u201cLuo Hao, what a surprise! Your [Gravity Art] is truly at an advanced level!! Ten times gravity! No wonder you are so arrogant.\u201d\u201cHahaha! If I can\u2019t even do that, how could I claim that I will bury you with me?\u201d Luo Hao replied calmly, with an indifferent smile on his face. Meanwhile, the broadsword on his shoulder gave out a dazzling blue light, increasing that monstrous pressure.Luo Hao laughed loudly as he wielded the sword in his hand, and walked right in front of Mu Yu Die, obstructing the Crescent emissary.After the Crescent emissary displayed the [Green Claw], a gloomy green light had pervaded the air. But it seemed to be influenced by the increased gravity, for the Crescent emissary had difficulty controlling it. He curved his fingers and pushed forward, as he encircled Luo Hao with other three Star emissaries.\u201cZhao Xin, take Miss Mu away!\u201d Luo Hao shouted. The broadsword in his hand gave out a bright blue light, and looked like a shooting star when slashed. It was able to obstruct the enemy and bar their way.Shi Yan was hiding behind an ancient tree, some fifty metres away from the fight. He gazed at the fight with a rigid face, with his eyes shining in the dark.All the people from the Dark World were at the Nascent Realm. And that Crescent emissary had reached the Second Sky of the Disaster Realm. It was too much for him. If he hastily took action, he would be easily killed before he could move near Mu Yu Die.Shi Yan was envisioning various scenarios for the best possible approach.A few seconds later, his eyes radiated. He grabbed his bag cautiously and took out the Bone Cutting powder, which was wrapped in a soft cloth. Lowering his body, he then quietly climbed out onto the tree branch.Through the long branches of the tree, Shi Yan was moving cautiously toward the battling crowd.Bone Cutting powder was a drug invented by Karu, the alchemist who was unmindful of his work. It made one\u2019s veins and bones become numb, decreased their power. Its effect could last for 3 hours; enough time to change the result of a battle.\u201cZhao Xin! Leave!\u201d Luo Hao roared, as his sword radiated with blue light. He, by himself, was fighting against the Dark World\u2019s assassins.\u201cMiss Mu!\u201d Zhao Xin was anxious; he stamped on the ground and said, \u201cHurry please!\u201dMu Yu Die looked tranquil, but her eyes showed stubbornness. She spoke softly, \u201cI won\u2019t leave. If you three stay, we might win. But once we leave, Uncle Luo will definitely die. Without Uncle Luo, we can\u2019t win against the Dark World anyway. We would still be caught.\u201d\u201cGood! Let\u2019s fight till death!\u201d Zhao Xin was a smart person. Upon hearing Mu Ye Die\u2019s words, he made up his mind and shouted, \u201cDi Yalan! Hu Long! Fight!\u201dThey encircled Mu Yu Die, took out their sharp weapons, and charged with all their strength toward those Dark World emissaries.\u201cFour of you, go and take care of those three kids.\u201d The Crescent emissary frowned and ordered coldly, \u201cDon\u2019t hurt Miss Mu. The Lord has given the order. Miss Mu should be taken back alive and unhurt.\u201d\u201cYes Sir!\u201d the four Star emissaries replied, and in no time rushed toward those three.Just then!Abruptly, a slight sound came from above. The Crescent emissary aroused vigilance. As soon as he looked up, he shouted, \u201cDammit! Run!\u201dIt was too late!Grey dust fell from the sky like drizzle and spread over the area. Everybody, including those from the Dark World, were covered by the dust. No one was spared.The Crescent emissary quickly realized the situation as he held his breath. Though he drew back, there was still a lot of dust on his gown. However, the dust had a strong penetrating power as it entered into his body through his skin. As his hands and feet became numb, he had a quick thought, and operated his Profound Qi to defend against it.But those Star emissaries were not as cautious as he was. Many of them inhaled the Bone Cutting powder, which went into their hearts and lungs, which then quickly affected their bodies. In a few seconds, they were numb all over, their bones softened and their strength weakened.Luo Hao\u2019s face turned dark all of a sudden. He was a victim too. Exhausted from the fight, he circulated his meagre Profound Qi thorough out his body in order to counter the poison. He looked up into the sky with cold eyes.A thin figure showed up from the branches above them. With an indifferent face, that person flew down from the tree lightly and stood by Mu Yu Die calmly, with the latter shocked. He took out a medicine bag and said lightly, \u201cSmell the fragrance, you will be detoxified.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s you?!\u201d Astonishment took over Mu Yu Die\u2019s moon-like face. She couldn\u2019t believe it was Shi Yan who flew down from the above.Gazing at Shi Yan carefully, Mu Yu Die was even more surprised. Shi Yan had reached the Nascent Realm in the past few days. How on earth?!\u201cMiss, you have saved me twice. Once unintentionally, and another intentionally. I will remember that forever.\u201d Shi Yan smiled. Seeing that, Mu Yu Die grabbed the medicine bag. He added, \u201cThe effect of the Bone Cutting powder shall last for three hours, which is not too long, but not too short either. You should know how to deal with it, Miss.\u201d His dark eyes suddenly went cold.\u201cGot it.\u201d Mu Yu Die got what Shi Yan said. She took a deep breath of the fragrance, and then passed the bag to Zhao Xin near her, \u201cQuick!\u201dThe Crescent emissary was still operating his Profound Qi to defend against the effects of Bone Cutting powder. Seeing that situation, he shouted with a rigid face, \u201cMove! Grab that medicine bag! If they are cured by that powder, none of you will survive!\u201dAfter saying that, he forced his Profound Qi and dashed toward Luo Hao.As soon as those Star emissaries comprehended the situation, they began to besiege Zhao Xin again, despite the poison in their bodies.Before Zhao Xin could get the medicine bag from Mu Yu Die, he was surrounded by numerous attacks.His face turned pale, and he had to give up on the medicine bag. Instead, he concentrated and began to confront those emissaries\u2019 attacks.So were Hu Long and Di Yanlan. Under the fierce attacks of those Star emissaries, they couldn\u2019t even breathe from the medicine bag.Mu Yu Die held onto that medicine bag, but couldn\u2019t get a chance to pass it to others, so she became very anxious.Helplessly, Mu Yu Die turned to Shi Yan. Her beautiful eyes were asking for his help.Everybody else was poisoned by Bone Cutting powder, and she couldn\u2019t operate her profound Qi wildly. Although Shi Yan was low-ranked, he was quite important now.Seeing Mu Yu Die\u2019s pleading eyes, Shi Yan smiled and asked naturally, \u201cMiss, may I know your name?\u201d\u201cMu Yu Die.\u201d\u201cA nice name.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Yan nodded, and imprinted that name in his mind. Under Mu Yu Die\u2019s gaze, he darted out instantly!With a dagger in his hand, Shi Yan broke into those emissaries and wielded his dagger with a serious face. The dagger made cold streaks in the air.In no time, the Star emissary who was most affected by the Bone Cutting powder had a deep wound in his neck and fell to the ground on his back.Shi Yan made swift moves amongst those emissaries and left scars on them, his body flashing like a sharp weapon.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d Mu Yu Die combed her short hair to the side of her ear with her hand. Astonishment flashed through her eyes, and there was a weird look on her face: \u201cI just\u2026 I just wanted him to pass them the bag\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He moved among those Star emissaries swiftly, avoiding their attacks while leaving wounds on their bodies.Three Star emissaries were completely poisoned by the Bone Cutting powder. Their hands and feet were losing strength slowly, and their movements were becoming very slow.Assaulted by Shi Yan, the three stood in a triangle, supporting themselves arduously.Shi Yan looked indifferent as he moved about like a ghost. Between the waves of that dagger, icy light exploded.\u201cAhhhh!\u201dOne of the Star emissaries was hit in the back, so he couldn\u2019t help but shout \u201cKill this bastard first!\u201dThe other two Star emissaries nodded in hatred. Letting go of Zhao Xin, Di Yalan and Hu Long, the three emissaries spared no effort to operate their Profound Qi. Three streaks of rainbow light sprang from their hands.The rainbow light flew toward Shi Yan like a sentient arrow, reflecting the thoughts of its masters.\u201cBe careful! That is the [Dark King Spear] from the Dark World!\u201d Mu Yu Die cried, \u201cDon\u2019t keep the image of that in your mind, or it will chase you forever!\u201dShi Yan decisively moved out of the entanglement, dropping any ideas of fighting against the enemy and cleared his mind.In an instant, the three [Dark King Spears] lost their direction and shot toward the grass in the distance. Bits of grass burst out in the explosion.\u201cDamn it!\u201d One Star emissary cursed, and prepared to use some other tricks.Just then, Zhao Xin smelled the medicine bag and gradually recovered from the Bone Cutting powder. Realizing this, the Star emissary who was ready for trouble, dashed toward him.Zhao Xin swung his arms. His arms started to stretch out and draw back like a snake. Like a snake, Zhao Xin clasped the emissary, binding him from all angles.\u201cHu Long!\u201d Mu Yu Die shouted, and threw the bag to Hu Long, who smelled the bag and quickly dashed out.As Zhao Xin and Hu Long had both re-joined the fight, Shi Yan felt less stressed. After sniffing the bag, the two got their energy back. But those three Dark Star emissaries got weaker and weaker after they poisoned by the Bone Cutting powder. Soon they would be killed by Zhao Xin and Hu Long.\u201cDi Yalan, out of the battle! Give this medicine bag to Uncle Luo.\u201d Mu Yu Die called to Di Yalan as she saw her ready to join the fight.Di Yalan understood what Mu Yu Die meant, and rapidly ran to Luo Hao.Shi Yan stopped and walked to Mu Yu Die. Standing by her, he looked indifferent, but his eyes kept wandering to Di Yalan.Bordeaux long hair, bronze skin; Di Yalan was wearing crimson armour, which only covered her big breasts, the triangle area, and her cute hips. Her flat belly and shiny long legs were all exposed.Though Di Yalan\u2019s face was not that pretty, her figure was really hot, and her dress was wild enough to arouse any man.Even while standing beside Mu Yu Die, Shi Yan didn\u2019t look at her at all. On the contrary, he couldn\u2019t move his goo-goo eyes away from Di Yalan, and didn\u2019t even bother to hide his male instinct.\u201cIs she pretty?\u201d Mu Yu Die frowned and sniffed. Apparently she was a little unhappy.Shi Yan came to his senses and smiled to her, \u201cEvery man will be attracted by this hot girl.\u201dMu Yu Die had a gleam in her eyes as she gazed at him for a while, and then she giggled. \u201cYou are really funny! How old are you? Are you a mature man?\u201dShi Yan was surprised. She reminded him that his body was only seventeen years old. And since he was getting skinnier these days, he looked like a fourteen year old boy now.Being in such an immature body and calling himself a man, talking about such erotic thing. Everything he did was really weird.Shaking his head, Shi Yan didn\u2019t explain. He pretended to walk away from Mu Yu Die naturally and approached Zhao Xin and Hu Long.With a shrill cry, a Star emissary spurted blood out of his mouth. His heart was ruptured by Zhao Xin\u2019s [Sky Snake]. He shook for a moment and then died.Shi Yan came forward. The Profound Qi from the dead body was slowly absorbed into Shi Yan\u2019s body in a way only he knew. At the same time, Shi Yan\u2019s eyes began to show a fierce glint, and a killing desire took over his mind.He knew that before the Profound Qi was purified, that desire would not disappear easily.Having seen what happened with Master Karu, Shi Yan had some experience now.After sensing it carefully for a while, he found that since he had reached the Nascent Realm, he could suppress the crazy desire in his mind and kept rational after he absorbed the Profound Qi from the two persons who were of the same level.Shi Yan guessed it was because his level was upgraded. He was merely an Elementary Realm Warrior before, while Karu was of the Nascent Realm, he crossed a Realm to purify Karu\u2019s Profound Qi, thus he went that crazy.\u201cGo after them!\u201dWhile Shi Yan was pondering, Zhao Xin yelled, and ran with Hu Long in the direction of those escaping emissaries.\u201cStop chasing! Let\u2019s leave right now!\u201d Seeing that the leader, the Crescent emissary, was running away too, Luo Hao shouted at Zhao Xin and Hu Long.\u201cWhy, Uncle Luo?!\u201d Zhao Xin couldn\u2019t understand.Luo Hao breathed the fragrance from the medicine bag deeply, and urged, \u201cSomeone\u2019s coming! Must be another troop sent out from the Dark World. It will be too late for us to leave if the two troops meet. Remember! What is important is not killing those emissaries, but to protect Die!\u201dHearing that another troop was coming, Zhao Xin was astonished, and thus nodded in agreement.Luo Hao said no more. Though he had not entirely recovered, he came holding Mu Yu Die\u2019s arm and said to Shi Yan, \u201cBoy, thank you very much. However, it\u2019s none of your business, so don\u2019t get involved and suffer. Goodbye.\u201d\u201cI own Miss Mu a life.\u201dShi Yan did not seem to know how ferocious the Dark World was. He looked nonchalant and said, \u201cOne needs to return in form of a lake for the favor of one drop, and Miss Mu did save my life. I discriminate between love and hate. If someone treats me badly, I would pay him back ten times the hatred. If someone does me a favor, I would also return ten times the gratitude. I will travel with you for a while. Hope I can help.\u201d\u201cYou sure are a man!\u201d Hu Long praised.Di Yalan showed radiance in her eyes, and giggled, \u201cKid, you are not only horny, but also righteous and bold! You peeped me for quite a long time. I was going to teach you a lesson, now you are forgiven!\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Mu Yu Die was stunned. She didn\u2019t expect Shi Yan to be so fair-minded. She was a little bit moved.\u201cWell, if you insist, I would not stop you.\u201d Luo Hao replied and nodded. He held Mu Yu Die and began to run.The other three followed them rapidly. Shi Yan inhaled, and followed instantly.\u2014With a troop of warriors from Mo family, Mo Chaoge was moving fast through the woods. Suddenly he stopped halfway, rigidly staring at some emissaries from the Dark World who had showed up unexpectedly.The Crescent emissary was astounded too. He observed Mo Chaoge and his warriors with questioning eyes. Not knowing where they came from, the emissary was a little worried. Maybe they came to aid Luo Hao.\u201cSecond Uncle\u2026\u201d Mo Yanyu murmured. Her intuition was telling her that those people were not here with good intentions, so she wanted to remind Mo Chaoge.Mo Chaoge stared into the Crescent emissary\u2019s eyes for a while, and remarked, \u201cOur target is a skinny boy around fifteen years of age, who was last seen carrying a bag. We have no intention of offending you.\u201dThe Crescent emissary was secretly relieved secretly. The Bone Cutting powder was taking effect in his body now, so he could only utilize 30% of his ability. If he were to fight against Mo Chaoge, the outcome won\u2019t be good.Hearing what Mo Chaoge said, he had an idea. He said cunningly, \u201cOh, we have seen that boy. He was with our target.\u201d\u201cMay I know where that boy is now?\u201d Mo Chaoge asked politely.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe didn\u2019t notice that Crescent emissary was poisoned by the Bone Cutting powder. But according to the gloomy air of that person, he guessed that the emissary was a tricky one, so he held his arrogance.\u201cOver there.\u201d the Crescent Emissary directed and answered coldly, \u201cYou\u2019d better be careful. That bastard is at a low level, but he is accompanied by a warrior at the First Sky of the Disaster Realm, who had the Martial art [Ten Times Gravity]. Too tough.\u201d\u201cFirst Sky of the Disaster Realm!\u201d Hearing that, Mo Chaoge frowned slightly, and then nodded, \u201cThanks for the information!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Mo Chaoge waved his hand and left hurriedly with the warriors of the Mo Family.\u201cThis guy was at the Disaster Realm as well.\u201d After they left, The Crescent emissary\u2019s eyes turned dim. He smirked, \u201cLittle bastard, you ruined my plan. I will kill you when I recover.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19 \u2013 Petrifaction Martial SpiritA huge ancient tree appeared in front of Luo Hao. Dozens metres high, it was so thick that ten people couldn\u2019t circle it hand in hand. The leaves almost covered the sky.Luo Hao stopped walking suddenly and released Mu Yu Die, then gazed at the ancient tree. He looked dignified and seemed to be making a crucial decision.As Zhao Xin, Di Yalan, and Hu Long came near the ancient tree, they turned serious as well, seemingly knowing there was something unusual about this tree.Shi Yan frowned, and he began to stare at this huge tree too, not saying a word.Luo Hao took a deep breath and turned to them, speaking in a low voice: \u201cTo the right side of this Sky Tree, there are hardly any demon beasts, so most warriors and trade caravans choose this way when they cross the Dark Forest. This route is quite safe. Even if we encounter some demon beasts, they would be of low level \u2013 Level One or Level Two. And this route is closer to the Merchant Union, merely taking ten days to get there.\u201dZhao Xin and the other two nodded. Apparently they all knew it.After pausing for a while, Luo Hao added in a serious manner, \u201cBut to the left of the Sky Tree, the situation is totally different! It\u2019s a longer way to the Merchant Union, and is haunted with demon beasts and many audacious warriors and soldiers. Those who dare to go this way are mostly tough guys. Being in danger all the time, they follow no restrictions of any kind. If we choose this way, we need to look out for not only demon beasts, but also for those irrational warriors and soldiers, especially when we have two pretty girls here among us\u2026\u201d\u201cHumph! Anyone who would want to take advantage of me, I will chop his head off!\u201d Di Yalan made a cutting motion in the air, with coldness in her beautiful eyes.\u201cUncle Luo, what do you think?\u201d Zhao Xin asked.\u201cIf we advance to the right, those from the Dark World will catch up in approximately one day and there will be a nasty fight.\u201d Having no choice and depressed, Luo Hao said, \u201cNo one knows if we would be lucky enough in these upcoming days. And if their reinforcements came, it doesn\u2019t bode well for us\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about going to the left?\u201d Hu Long asked.\u201cIf we go to the left, we would come across demon beasts, and more likely, we will be killed by those insane warriors. But it will be the same for those from the Dark World. They have bad reputation, and hardly anyone will go against them in the Fire Empire. Yet in this situation, they are the targets of the demon beasts and warriors. If they meet high-grade demon beasts accidentally, it\u2019s possible that they all will be killed\u2026\u201dLuo Hao made his speech slowly, and after explaining them the situation, he remarked, \u201cTo go via the right side, we won\u2019t be confronting any demon beasts or warriors, but the Dark World will be a huge threat. To the left, we may be attacked by demon beasts and warriors, but the Dark World shall also be threatened. Therefore, to go via the left, we have a greater possibility to escape.\u201d\u201cGo to the left then!\u201d Mu Yu Die said decisively.\u201cOk.\u201d Luo Hao nodded, and took a glance at Shi Yan, and said, \u201cHey kid, there is still time if you want to leave. Otherwise\u2026 you will have no chance.\u201d\u201cI will go with you guys.\u201d Shi Yan had made up his mind. There was a very irrational side in his personality. That\u2019s why he had drowned in extreme sports, which were like games of death, for the past ten years.When Luo Hao was depicting the danger of the left side, Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help but get excited.Luo Hao nodded and waved his arm, \u201cWell, let\u2019s set off. From now on, everyone must be on alert!\u201d\u2014One hour later.Mo Chaoge and the warriors from the Mo family also stopped at the Sky Tree.\u201cSecond Uncle, which way would they have chosen?\u201d Mo Yanyu asked.\u201cI will chase by the right side. If I don\u2019t come back in two hours, you guys catch up this way. However, if I don\u2019t find them in two hours, they should have taken the left way.\u201d Mo Chaoge thought for a while and ordered them to wait at the intersection. Then he flew away to the right side.After one and a half hours, Mo Chaoge came back with a pale face, \u201cNot even a slightest sign of these people. How dare they take the left side! Everybody watch out! There are many demon beasts and warriors on the left side. Never be negligent! Remember, don\u2019t make a fuss with those warriors and soldiers. These people are all lunatics. Don\u2019t provoke these people who don\u2019t know what death is.\u201d\u201cYes sir!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u2014Three Saber-toothed Rhinos were strolling along a brook leisurely. They were Level-3 demon beasts. A silver glow shone on the back, their teeth were as sharp as sabers, while their fist-like brown eyes glittered with a murderous look. The three rhinos were all covered by hard mud, which formed a natural armour, through which any normal weapon would find hard to cut.The three Saber-toothed Rhinos were sipping water now and then, while looking around discreetly, seemingly to be looking for game.In the bushes not far from them, Luo Hao made a gesture to imply everybody to be quiet.Until the three Saber-toothed Rhinos walked away slowly, Luo Hao uttered a sigh of relief. He said, \u201cSaber-toothed Rhinos are Level-3 demon beasts, equaling Human Realm Warriors. They move fast and have sharp tusks. Low leveled warriors would either be injured or be killed once they met Saber-toothed Rhinos.\u201dShi Yan kept wandering his eyes over those slowly disappearing rhinos, showing an interest in having a fight with them.\u201cRather than killing the demon beasts here, our goal is to protect Die. Everybody remember this! Don\u2019t bring up any unnecessary ramifications.\u201d Luo Hao seemed to have noticed Shi Yan\u2019s thoughts, and thus reminded them casually.Shi Yan grinned, and nodded to show he understood.\u201cLet\u2019s keep going. We need to be watchful here. To keep an eye on the surroundings is more important than moving forward fast. Try to get away from demon beasts and warriors. Don\u2019t get ourselves in trouble.\u201d Luo Hao added. Then he advanced with the troop.\u2014It was getting dark.Beside a lush tree at the brook, Zhao Xin and the other two separated and examined the surroundings with a cautious eye, in case any demon beast showed up.Shi Yan sat upright on the wet ground with a serious look.Bloodlust was lingering in Shi Yan\u2019s mind like smoke. He had an urge to release it. It was high time he purify the Profound Qi he absorbed from the two Star emissaries, thus he was becoming a little impatient.Luo Hao stood beside Mu Yu Die all the times. Frowning, he focused his eyes on Shi Yan, lest this boy took any abnormal action.Mu Yu Die looked indifferent, and she stared at Shi Yan for a while. When she saw the aggressive look on his face, she sat down gently and crossed her legs. Setting the ancient zither on her legs, she began to play.Hearing the zither, the concentrated bloodthirst in Shi Yan\u2019s mind seemed to be resolved by a certain power and gradually faded away.Holding his breath and focusing his mind, Shi Yan operated his Profound Qi peacefully.One hour later, a warm flow gushed out of his meridians all over his body.Shi Yan\u2019s body trembled.Suddenly, Shi Yan got a severe thirst in his body. The weird power gushing out from his meridians was absorbed by his muscles and bones, before it could mix with the Profound Qi in his abdomen. The warm stream went into his muscles and bones, and set root in his blood and flesh.Within several breaths, the weird warm stream from his meridians pervaded into his blood, flesh and bones all over the body, which astonished him a lot.Thus, Shi Yan began to feel the warm stream flowing in his blood, flesh and bones.\u201cBang!\u201dThere was a heavy strike in his head, and the next moment, he felt a strange change in his body.Turning pale with fear, he opened his eyes promptly to find his bare arms turning grey, bit by bit.Petrifaction!Shi Yan was frightened. He began to withdraw his attention from his body, not giving a single thought to the sudden change.As his thoughts changed, his hardening body soon went back to normal.Concentrating, Shi Yan looked at the others. Luo Hao and Mu Yu Die were chatting behind a tree not far from him, without noticing what he had just experienced.Relieved, happiness took over his face, as he secretly enjoyed a mirthful time.His body became hard, which meant the Petrifaction Martial Spirit of the Shi family had awakened!The Petrifaction Martial Spirit was exclusive to the Shi family. As one\u2019s level increased, it became stronger and stronger, to the extent that one won\u2019t be damaged by weapons and the impact of Profound Qi.Before, Shi Yan had thought that the owner of his body didn\u2019t possess this Martial Spirit. It surprised him that it had awakened after he reached Nascent Realm. He was ecstatic.The Petrifaction Martial Spirit was beneficial in battles. After Petrification, one\u2019s body would be as hard as rock, but was still very agile, which would increase one\u2019s ability a lot.Apart from Petrifaction, Shi Yan also found he also possessed the Immortal Martial Spirit, which could achieve self-recovery. With the help of these two Martial Spirits and more training, he couldn\u2019t imagine how powerful his body would become.\u201cNo!\u201d Shi Yan frowned and thought, \u201cDon\u2019t Martial Spirits show up not long after birth? But this body is already seventeen, and yet my Martial Spirit can still awaken? Too strange! Or does it have something to do with the weird energy gushing out from the meridians?\u201dAn idea suddenly flashed in his mind. The activation of the two Martial Spirits; Petrifaction and Immortal, were somehow related to the blood pool and the changes in his meridians.Shi Yan guessed that the weird stream gushing out from his meridians could stimulate the Martial Spirit hidden in one\u2019s body. With this thought, he was so excited that he wanted to sing out loud and celebrate!A Martial Spirit was inherited. Generally, it got stronger as one\u2019s level increased. There were hardly any other ways to strengthen a Martial Spirit.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA Martial Spirit was the gift that a warrior was most proud of, and also the vital thing to define a warrior\u2019s ability. Warriors trained arduously to improve their Martial Spirit.But even if one\u2019s level had upgraded, there were limitations in increasing the level of a Martial Spirit.On the Grace Mainland, even those legendary God-Level alchemists could barely refine pills effective to general Martial Spirits. Those pills were rare and precious on the Grace Mainland, and were believed to exist merely in legends.Nonetheless, the effect those pills had on Martial Spirits was also quite limited. After all, Martial Spirits were an inherited gift, which was very hard to change.Surprisingly, the weird warm stream gushing out from Shi Yan\u2019s meridians seemed to go against the rules. It could virtually stimulate Martial Spirit and increase its ability.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The cool moonlight went through the tree leaves and scattered around, illuminating the quiet and dark forest.Di Yalan and Hu Long were patrolling around, while Zhao Xin was having a rest, leaning against the tree with stable breaths, eyes closed.Luo Hao was standing next to another ancient tree on alert, never relaxing his vigilance.Among the dense leaves of that tree, Mu Yu Die was sleeping quietly. After a long day\u2019s journey, she was exhausted, for she couldn\u2019t operate her Profound Qi at will.Luo Hao looked up at Mu Yu Die, who was resting among the leaves, now and then, showing a rare tenderness in his eyes.\u201cDaa! Daa!\u201dLuo Hao\u2019s thick eyebrows frowned, as he saw Shi Yan approaching nearby. He asked in surprise, \u201cStill awake?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Shi Yan nodded and answered in a low tone. He stood still beside Luo Hao, and asked under his breath, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be easy for them to spot us here?\u201d\u201cOf course not.\u201d Luo Hao smiled, \u201cThere is no settled route through the forest, and demon beasts and warriors are always showing up now and then, so those from the Dark World will find it hard to distinguish our tracks. In this area, those demon beasts and warriors are whom we need to pay more attention to.\u201d\u201cThat is to say, they won\u2019t find us easily.\u201d After pondering a bit, Shi Yan asked again, \u201cUncle Luo, do you need to consume too much Profound Qi to release your gravitational field?\u201d\u201cWhy do you want to know this?\u201d Luo Hao was puzzled.\u201cI want to steel myself with the help of your gravitational field. Under the gravitational field, I will have to bear a huge pressure, which will strengthen my body. I want to know my limits.\u201d Shi Yan replied seriously. He didn\u2019t go with the conventional path. Usual training didn\u2019t excite him, so he seeked out passion desperately.\u201cTo steel yourself by using my gravitational field\u2026\u201d Luo Hao\u2019s eyes lit up, and he nodded, \u201cGreat idea, but are you sure you want to try it? If those emissaries found us while you were exhausted, you couldn\u2019t even fight back.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t plan to use my Profound QI.\u201d Shi Yan smiled.\u201cTo steel yourself using merely with your body?\u201d Luo Hao was shocked.\u201cYes.\u201dLuo Hao fell in a deep thought for a long time, and said, \u201cYou have just reached the Nascent Realm, so it is beneficial to train your body in a proper way and get used to it. But you haven\u2019t strengthened your body before. It is crazy that you want to train in my gravitational field without operating your Profound Qi. You\u2019re sure you can endure that?\u201d\u201cI want to try.\u201d Shi Yan replied calmly.\u201cGood! Follow me.\u201d Luo Hao nodded, and walked away without making a sound. Shi Yan followed him.After they left in silence, Mu Yu Die, who was sleeping on the leaves, slowly opened her eyes.Gazing at the two people beside the river from afar, Mu Yu Die was taken by surprise and puzzlement. She murmured to herself, \u201cJust reached the Nascent Realm and he wants to steel himself under the gravitational field. Is this guy insane?\u201dMu Yu Die became more and more confused as she thought about it, so much that she couldn\u2019t fall asleep any more. Out of curiosity, she slipped down the ancient tree dexterously, and sneaked over to Shi Yan and Luo Hao, in order to see what would happen next.\u2014\u201cLet\u2019s start with the gravitational field at five times normal gravity first. Generally, a Nascent Realm warrior\u2019s body can only endure this after undergoing specialised training. You have to do what you are capable of. When you feel it is unbearable, stop the procedure at once.\u201dStanding still, Luo Hao added, \u201cSince it\u2019s your first training, run laps around me first. If you can run ten laps without using your Profound Qi, your body will strengthen. Remember, do within your limits!\u201dAfter his speech, a violent wave broke out from Luo Hao\u2019s body all at once.In an instant, centering about Luo Hao, the gravity surged by five times! The area around him seemed to have collapsed. The air had become so heavy that one could hardly breathe.An invisible pressure suddenly surrounded him all over!Shi Yan felt as if sand had filled all his cells, and his body was carrying hundreds of pounds of weight. The tendons of his knees tightened, and his heart was beating at a faster rate. Under the effects of the increased gravity, all his muscles were under tremendous pressure.His body slowly adapted to the invisible pressure from the increased gravity. However, he found it hard to breathe, even when merely standing still.Holy crap!Shi Yan was too astonished when he felt that overwhelming pressure. He thought to himself that, anyone who went into Luo Hao\u2019s gravitational field would be severely influenced by it. They wouldn\u2019t be able to use their abilities at their best.It was only five times of gravity. What would happen if it was increased by ten times?Realizing the horrifying part of this Martial Spirit, Shi Yan took a deep breath, and drove all the distracting thoughts out of his mind. He yelled, and then began to run around Luo Hao.His body shook as the pressure increased. His feet seemed to be filled with metal, and were heavier than a thousand pounds. Normal running also became the most terrible torment.In the gravitational field, his body couldn\u2019t move easily. He felt as if being pressed by a giant. He could hardly breathe.One lap. His speed had slowed down by half.Three laps. He slowed down by half again.Five laps. Shi Yan was not running, instead he was walking\u2026On the sixth lap, Shi Yan\u2019s face was as red as an apple, while the blue veins on his arms were trembling like small snakes, about to jump out of the skin.On the seventh lap, Shi Yan looked like a beast, as his eyes were almost on fire from the lack of oxygen.On the eighth lap, Shi Yan staggered. Every step exhausted him. After every step he would quiver.At that time, Luo Hao couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. He shouted, \u201cIt is your first gravitational field training. Don\u2019t try too hard! You have reached your limit here! Enough! Stop! Or you will be dead tired.\u201dShi Yan raised his head, while his eyes looked as if they were bleeding. He said in a grave tone, \u201cHehe. That was interesting, let\u2019s go on!\u201dLuo Hao stood aghast, and could only come up with the idea conclusion: \u2018this guy went insane!\u2019In the bushes not far from them, Mu Yu Die was speechless, her mouth covered by her hand. She had never met someone like Shi Yan before.Shi Yan didn\u2019t reply Luo Hao. After another beast-like haul, he continued to step forward. With his face showing extreme stress, he finished another lap.By the last lap, his body was swaying. He had a quiver in each step, and could fall any time, as if he would die at any moment.With his body in that state, he finished another lap, step by step. After that, he got a weird smile on his face.Waking from his astonishment, Luo Hao was relieved when he saw Shi Yan was ok. He was about to withdraw the gravitational field before advising Shi Yan.Mu Yu Die pressed her mouth with her hand, and had an amazed look in her attractive eyes. She had never thought that Shi Yan would achieved this extreme challenge, even if he was at the Nascent Realm.\u201cAnother lap.\u201d Shi Yan yelled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWhat?\u201d Luo Hao\u2019s body shook greatly, and his eyes grew as sharp as knives. He shouted, \u201cEnough! Don\u2019t fool around!\u201dBefore Luo Hao withdrew the gravitational field, Shi Yan continued to walk unexpectedly. He was staggering, and finally dropped on the ground.Luo Hao was just about to shout, when he found Shi Yan was using both his hands and feet, crawling like a demon beast. He seemed to be seeking death on purpose.After about half an hour, Shi Yan finally made it to the end, as slow as a snail.Mu Yu Die stared at him from the bushes, completely stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His face was red, as though he were bleeding. He was panting heavily and his body was twitching every now and then.Looking at the sparkling stars above, Shi Yan could feel every cell of his body trembling. As his body twitched, his muscles, veins, and bones were all expanding and contracting regularly.Not using his Profound Qi, he closed his eyes slowly, and began to feel the fantastic shift in his body, the amazing quivers in the muscles and ribs, the destruction and reconstruction of cells, and the slow increase in strength.As a wild fanatic for extreme sports, Shi Yan knew that reaching his this limit this time was merely the beginning of next adventure.The limit of a human body could always be broken, and be surpassed time and time again. The potential of human body was infinite.Those extreme sports experiences had taught him that only by breaking the limit could he obtain rapid progress.With his eyes closed, he could clearly sense the changes happening in his muscle fibres, even without operating his Profound Qi.Sensing it carefully, Shi Yan soon found the Immortal Martial Spirit in his body beginning to work. It was repairing his body in an incredible way, reconstructing and strengthening his torn muscles.Rigorous training under increased gravity enhanced one\u2019s explosive force. Only when the muscles tore under these extreme conditions could they become bigger, more powerful, and more explosive after reconstruction.As a fanatic for extreme sports, Shi Yan was so aware of the truth, which had been verified by his repeated practices. He knew the fastest way to strengthen his muscles.Feeling the effects of his Immortal Martial Spirit beginning to reduce the pain in all his muscle fibers, Shi Yan struggled to sit up. He took the food out of his bag and began to wolf it down, feeling happy with his progress.Intensive exercise consumed too much of his energy. He had to eat a lot of food to recover quickly and improve his power.The dry meat was eaten and slipped into his guts where it was quickly digested and became nutrition.In a very short time, he had finished enough food for five people.As he felt the changes in his body, his smile became broader. After exercising his limbs for a while, he closed his eyes and began to circulate his Profound Qi quietly.As the Profound Qi moved, Shi Yan felt a slight quiver in his body.Just as he had expected!The Profound Qi was flowing in his meridians virtually 30% faster than normal.His body became more sensitive after the extreme stress and likewise, his meridians became abnormally dynamic. His weak meridians seemed to be absorbing the Profound Qi flowing through them, and with that energy, his meridians expanded and became firmer.Shi Yan had presumed long ago that strengthening the body was as important as training the Profound Qi; the two were complementary.Once the body was strong enough, the Profound Qi would condense faster. The stronger the body, the more beneficial it was when operating and condensing Profound Qi. So maybe, the two Martial Spirits hidden in his body would enhance as well.His first attempt had successfully verified Shi Yan\u2019s hypothesis, so he was grinning from ear to ear.\u2014In the thick grass far away.\u201cDie, why are you here? You should have a good rest. Get plenty of sleep, so your Martial Spirit recovers.\u201d Luo Hao had noticed Mu Yu Die when he was training Shi Yan with his gravitational field. As Shi Yan was sprawled on the ground exhausted, Luo Hao came to Mu Yu Die secretly and complained.\u201cI couldn\u2019t sleep so I am just walking around. I just happened to see you training.\u201d Mu Yu Die smiled gently in fear.She paused, and said with a naughty smile, \u201cUncle Luo, was it too much for him? I remember that when you trained Zhao Xin, you had just tripled the gravity. Zhao Xin was at Second Sky of the Nascent Realm them, and had the experience of body strengthening before. Why did you quintuple the gravity for this guy?\u201dWearing a bitter smile, Luo Hao shook his head and sighed, \u201cI used the quintuple gravity at the very beginning to stop him from wasting energy and make him quit. Who would have known that he was insane! I was shocked in the end too! I tried to stop numerous times but he wouldn\u2019t agree!\u201d\u201cYou mean, you just tried to scare him in the beginning? So he won\u2019t ask you to train himself later on?\u201d Mu Yu Die rolled her eyes and felt quite speechless.\u201cYup.\u201d Luo Hao sighed again. \u201cYou know, to control the gravitational field consumes a lot of Profound Qi, and during that, I can\u2019t be distracted. I neither wanted to waste my own Profound Qi, nor wanted him to be paralyzed tomorrow, which would slow our journey. Who would have known that he is a lunatic.\u201d\u201cSo, Uncle Luo, how many laps did you presume that he could have managed?\u201d\u201cFour laps!\u201dLuo Hao lifted four fingers and said in a heavy voice, \u201cAverage warriors who have just stepped into the Nascent Realm without any systematic body training can only manage four laps in the quintuple gravitational field, five laps at most. That guy is so small and thin, so I thought he would ask me to stop on the fourth lap.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026 but he finished eleven laps.\u201d Mu Yu Die got a weird expression on her face. She couldn\u2019t help but take a glance at Shi Yan from afar, who was sitting there as firm as a mountain and training again. \u201cGod! He, he is upright again!\u201d\u201cWhat? He can still move?\u201d Luo Hao was stunned as he glanced over at Shi Yan. He shook his head and said, \u201cLunatic! This guy is a lunatic! Too reckless! I guess he couldn\u2019t even move tomorrow! With this intensive training, he would find his body hurting everywhere tomorrow. I bet we will have to adjust our plan tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWell, let it be. What an unruly guy!\u201d Mu Yu Die shook her head and smiled subtly.\u2014The next morning, before the sun rose, there was very heavy fog.\u201cDie, come down. It is time to set off.\u201d Under the ancient tree, Luo Hao called out to Mu Yu Die softly.\u201cI want to sleep more.\u201d Mu Yu Die murmured as if in dreams, \u201cWhy so early today? Weren\u2019t you sure that he couldn\u2019t move today\u2026\u201d\u201cHe is waiting for you.\u201d Luo Hao said in a very low voice, his face still trying to control his surprise.Ten minutes ago Shi Yan came to him asking for enough food for three people.Right in front of them, Shi Yan wolfed down the food and patted his belly, sighing with satisfaction, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d Luo Hao was totally astonished; he glared at Shi Yan with frightened eyes for a few minutes before he murmured to himself, \u201cPervert!\u201d\u201cThat guy is waiting for me too?\u201d Mu Yu Die murmured, rubbing her eyes unwillingly.\u201cYes, he is more energetic than anyone.\u201d He smiled bitterly.\u201cWhat?\u201d Mu Yu Die suddenly woke up, astonished. She looked for Shi Yan under the tree, to find him sitting straight like an arrow with bright eyes. The same as Luo Hao, she murmured, \u201dPervert!\u201dShi Yan scrutinized his own wearing and was sure that there was nothing strange. He frowned, \u201cUncle Luo, and Miss Mu, which part of me looks like a pervert?\u201d\u201cYour whole body!\u201d Mu Yu Die chuckled and got in a joyful mood.Her chuckle seemed to bring a spring that made the beautiful scenes in the Dark Forest seem dim in comparison.Zhao Xin and Hu Long were fascinated with goo-goo eyes; but the soon realised their misdemeanour and lowered their heads to cover it up, not daring to look into Mu Yu Die\u2019s eyes directly.Shi Yan narrowed his eyes and wandered his burning eyes on Mu Yu Die\u2019s beautiful face audaciously, \u201cMiss Mu, if I were a pervert, I would put my hands on you first. So be careful tonight, I would be unable to control myself. You should scream loudly then. I love women\u2019s crazy screams so much!\u201d\u201cHow dare you!\u201d Di Yalan sniffed.\u201cOh, sorry, I forgot there is another pretty woman. Maybe you are angry because I ignored you. Trust me, I will go for you too, don\u2019t be jealous now.\u201d Shi Yan pretended that he just realized that and patted his head to show regret, as if he had forgotten something important.\u201cHaha! Hahaha!\u201d Mu Yu Die held her stomach and burst into laughter in the tree, almost falling down. She pointed at Shi Yan and giggled, \u201cYou funny guy! Why are you so hilarious? Haha\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euDi Yalan was dumbstruck, and then chuckled too, feeling helpless when it came to Shi Yan.Zhao Xin and Hu Long were taken over by confusion too, and their facial expressions couldn\u2019t be stranger.They just couldn\u2019t understand that even when they always acted politely with the two girls, and didn\u2019t dare to do anything to offend them, they two girls scarcely smiled at them.While Shi Yan showed not the slightest hint politeness towards the girls with his giddy words, but the girls smiled at him a lot. What the hell is with that?\u201cOh!\u201d Luo Hao glanced at Shi Yan strangely and smiled, \u201cWell, stop it now, let\u2019s move.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the Stone Room of the Shi family.Yang Hai, who was a little stout, was sitting on a stone stool with a serious face. Eyes narrowed, he was checking an account book, page by page, and reporting the recent month\u2019s production status of the quarry to the family head of Shi family, Shi Jian.Though Shi Jian was in his seventies, he looked in good health. Being the family head of Shi family, he was simply wearing a plain gown which was suited to martial training. Sitting on a brown stone stool, he had a calm demeanor and was listening to Yang Hai earnestly.After Yang Hai illustrated the case, Shi Jian frowned and commented, \u201cHai, the production in recent months has literally decreased by 20 percent. What\u2019s up?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all because of the Mo and Ling families.\u201d Yang Hai sighed, \u201cMany skilled pitmen were lured away by their high salary. We are now lacking in pitmen. We were in bad situation due to the secret fight with the two families. Those pitmen feared that we would be beaten by them, plus they were being offered a higher salary, so the pitmen turned to them.\u201d\u201cHumph!\u201d Shi Jian sniffed. \u201cThey are doing that deliberately. Since Mo Yanyu and Ling Shao Feng got engaged, the Mo family and Ling families have gotten closer and closer. The Ling family has also been interfering in our secret fight with Mo family. They must have come to an agreement, or Mo family couldn\u2019t compete with us.\u201d\u201cMaster, when do we strike back?\u201d Yang Hai asked.\u201cNo worries. I have a plan.\u201d Shi Jian looked assured, then he paused and frowned, \u201cIs my little bastard grandson Shi Yan still is not back home?\u201d\u201cNo. I was just about to mention that.\u201d Yang Hai looked disturbed, \u201cThat stupid boy said he would go to the Dark Forest before he left. It\u2019s been a year since he left home. I received information a couple of days ago that Mo Chaoge and Mo Yanyu were in the Dark Forest as well. I\u2019m afraid he has had an accident. He didn\u2019t take any capable escorts with him. His mother Qing died early, and we have this single child. I am so worried\u2026\u201dShi Jian frowned and kept silent for a long while. Then he sighed, \u201cThis boy was born without inheriting the Petrifaction Martial Spirit of the Shi family, and nor was he fascinated by Martial Arts. Instead, he was crazy about those odd things, and would always goof around. Troublesome!\u201d\u201cMaster, it\u2019s all because of my humble bloodline. If I had a Martial Spirit, Qing would have given birth to a kid with a Martial Spirit.\u201d Yang Hai was ashamed.\u201cIt\u2019s all doomed.\u201d Shi Jian shook his head, \u201cHai, I found you by the Endless Sea. Though you are not my own, I treat you as my own son, or, I wouldn\u2019t have betrothed my daughter Qing to you. Yes, you don\u2019t own a Martial Spirit, nor did you train in Martial Arts, but you play a key role in the development of Shi family and the management of our quarries. We wouldn\u2019t have accumulated so much wealth if it hadn\u2019t been for you. Though you don\u2019t know about Martial Arts, you contribute a lot to the family.\u201d\u201cBut nowadays, a strong warrior is much more valuable than anything.\u201d Yang Hai smiled and mocked himself, \u201cIf I had a Martial Spirit, I would have trained in Martial Arts. And if Yan had inherited the Petrifaction Martial Spirit from his mother, he too would have trained in it. But a Martial Spirit is inborn\u2026\u201dShi Jian nodded, and sighed, \u201cYes. It\u2019s true. A strong warrior is more valuable than anything.\u201d\u201cFamily Head, could that little boy be in danger?\u201d Yang Hai couldn\u2019t help but worry.\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t be.\u201d Shi Jian thought for a while, and added, \u201cMy grandson isn\u2019t into Martial Arts, so the Mo family have never set their eyes upon him. Neither Mo Chaoge nor Mo Yanyu have seen him before. So it\u2019s not possible that they would harm him.\u201d\u201cBut I still feel something\u2019s wrong. He should have been home.\u201d\u201cWell, I will tell those soldiers in Silent Town to keep an eye for him. Silent Town was beside the Dark Forest. Once they spot Shi Yan, they will let us know. So don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cThank you, Family Head.\u201d\u201cWhy? Your son is also my grandson!\u201d Shi Jian glared at him and berated, \u201cHow many times have I told you? Don\u2019t call me Family Head. I\u2019m your adoptive father, and also your father-in-law. You can call me anything but Family Head.\u201d\u201cI got it, Father.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d\u2014The Dark Forest. A silent night.Luo Hao was standing still on the side of the track, with a quintuple gravitational field surrounding him; it was getting very hard to breath.Shi Yan was perspiring from all over his body, as he pounded in the air and jumped around Luo Hao. Blue veins showed up on his face and neck, quivering like little snakes.In the grass, Mu Yu Die was gazing at them secretly, biting a straw in her mouth.\u201cGuess how long could he endure today?\u201d Di Yalan asked as she walked up and sat beside her\u201cYou finished your task today?\u201d Mu Yu Die chuckled, without replying her.\u201cZhao Xin took over. It was really dangerous! A single horned silver snake was twining around the tree trunk, and I didn\u2019t notice it. I was almost bitten by it! If I hadn\u2019t moved quick enough, I would be dead right now.\u201dDi Yalan still looked terrified. She cursed, \u201cMore and more demon beasts are appearing these days. We have to be careful. We have met five groups of demon beasts in the past three days. They walk around especially at night. You\u2019d better take me with you next time you want to peep. Or you will be in danger.\u201d\u201cYou just wanted to say the last thing right?\u201d Mu Yu Die giggled.\u201cHa, you found it out.\u201d Di Yalan didn\u2019t disguise herself and said, \u201cThat guy is really something. He broke his limit every day in the past three days, and got more and more stamina. Though I\u2019m at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm, I don\u2019t dare break the rules in the quintuple gravitational field of Uncle Luo. This guy is literally insane. Every time, he won\u2019t stop until he faints. Nuts! Nuts!\u201d\u201cHis endurance is most shocking.\u201d Mu Yu Die shook her head slowly, as her eyes glimmered.\u201cYes, and he recovered in such a short time. Unbelievable! He is only at the First Sky of the Nascent Realm, but he has incredible recovering ability.\u201d Di Yalan was confused too.\u201cThis guy\u2026 has so many secrets\u2026\u201d Mu Yu Die thought for a while and murmured, \u201cI have never seen anyone greedier than him! He almost ate up all our food in the past three days. I\u2019m now worried about food. He is such a rice bucket*!\u201d(*ED Note: A \u2018rice bucket\u2019 is a slang term for a useless person. Someone who is only good for eating rice.)Di Yalan laughed, \u201cBut he talks in a funny way! Any of his casual talks could amuse us a lot. And he has so many novel ideas that I have never heard of. He says that kings must be voted in by citizens, and merchants dominate a country. By the way, he even composes sarcastic poems. I\u2019m really confused, how could this 17 year old boy be filled with so many odd things.\u201d\u201cAnd it is this 17 year old guy who looks as if he wants eat us when he casts his eyes upon us. I have never seen such possessive eyes. Bastard! Too bad!\u201d Mu Yu Die grinded her teeth, and made an action of cutting in the air, \u201cI would let him know how capable I am!\u201d\u201cTill your Martial Spirit is back, ha, what\u2019s the big deal to let him look at us? We don\u2019t lose anything. Also Zhao Xin and Hu Long, the cowards, pretend to not be ogling at my ass when I am right in front of them. I despise them more! Compared to them, that bastard is bolder, I like it!\u201d Di Yalan laughed loudly.\u201cYou are trying to seduce him?\u201d Mu Yu Die smirked, \u201cHe is still a kid! Don\u2019t seduce him!\u201d\u201cHave you seen any kid who gives that kind of look?\u201d Di Yalan lowered her voice, \u201cI am guessing that he is older than he looks. Maybe he had adopted some secret skill to make himself look young! Maybe it\u2019s a special secret Martial Spirit\u2026\u201d\u201cCould be. Seems we have to be careful.\u201d Mu Yu Die pondered, and then nodded slowly.\u2014\u201cBang!\u201dShi Yan was sprawled on his back. He was totally exhausted. He asked in a raucous voice, \u201cHow many laps?\u201d\u201cFifteen.\u201d Luo Hao answered with a complex look. \u201cYou made actions of jumping and rolling during the fifteen laps, which made the pressure much bigger. Young man, you really\u2026 can bear that?\u201d\u201cWell, we will know tomorrow.\u201d Shi Yan found it even impossible to speak.In the past three days, he trained in [Rampage] whenever he had free time.After the arduous training, the meridians in his chest and waist could easily release negative energy at his will, which made him pine away a lot.He almost trained every part of his body to the most, but the hardest part, was his brain\u2026At night, he would ask Luo Hao to lay the quintuple gravitational field, then he could steel himself under the massive stress.Three days. In those short three days, he broke his limit from eleven laps to fifteen laps. While running, he also increased the hardness as he jumped and rolled, to consume more energy.By undergoing this intensive training, he found his body becoming much more powerful than before. His hands, feet, ribs, muscles and entrails all became stronger. Every morning, when he woke from his training, his body would be full of explosiveness, and he could jump several meters higher in normal gravity. Even his hands and feet became more agile.He could feel the progress every day clearly, thus he continued the training, and wrecked himself crazily. He steeled himself in such strenuous way that his ability increased rapidly, while his Profound Qi condensed even faster as well.\u201cAaao! Aaao!\u201d There came a weird sound from far away.Luo Hao turned pale and cried out, \u201cIt\u2019s the Level-4 demon beast, Fire Snake! A Fire Snake is very tough. They don\u2019t usually go out at night. Someone must have annoyed them!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cUncle Luo!\u201d Zhao Xin and Hu Long hurried over, looking anxious.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Lou Hao yelled.\u201cA troop of warriors are hunting the Fire Snake, and the latter are approaching toward us! The warriors are hell bent, thus the Fire Snakes are totally irritated!\u201d Zhao Xin was in a panic.\u201cShit!\u201d Luo Hao took off the broadsword on his shoulder, and said, \u201cTake care of Die!\u201d Then he dashed away.Shi Yan, who was suffering all over, sat up immediately and began to operate his Profound Qi. Eyes lit and cool-minded, he silently gazed in the direction of Luo Hao.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She took a quick glance at Shi Yan while blushing, and guessed she had lost face.But soon she found her assumption incorrect, for Shi Yan didn\u2019t even pay attention to her. Instead, he was glaring at the direction of Luo Hao, like a wary beast.After a speedy Big Circulation cycle by Shi Yan, the pain had reduced bit by bit. Looking serious, Shi Yan tried to recover while focusing on Luo Hao.\u201cGo after it! The Fire Snake looks very weak now. Catch it! Don\u2019t let it go! \u201d\u201cFire the arrows! Quick!\u201d\u201cShoo! Shooo!\u201dFrom the woods not far away, came shouts and wrangles. Arrows flew fast in the air, chasing their targets.\u201cHooo!\u201dAll of a sudden, there was a fire in the woods. The fierce fire covered the area in no time, and heavy smoke rose quickly and twined around the trees, making people unable to breathe.\u201cKakaka! Bang Bang bang! Bang!\u201dThe sound of trees exploding, flying arrows, and fighters on the move, all came at the same time from that brook. A fierce battle was going on in the woods.\u201cSomeone\u2019s there!\u201d An unfriendly shout came from the woods, \u201cYou want to steal our success?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t get it wrong. I just don\u2019t want the Fire Snake to hurt my people, so I simply stopped it from running that way.\u201d It was Luo Hao\u2019s voice. He seemed to have a dispute with someone far away.\u201cHumph! We, the Tush Mercenary Union, have kept an eye on this Fire Snake for half a month, you\u2019d better not get involved.\u201d\u201cI said, I\u2019m not interested in a Level-4 demon beast.\u201d Luo Hao explained.\u201cUncle Luo is having words with someone, let\u2019s go and see.\u201d Mu Yu Die raised her head from the bushes and frowned. She was a little worried since she didn\u2019t know what was happening there.\u201cYes, let\u2019s go!\u201d Hu Long grunted, \u201cI have heard of the Tush Mercenary Union. They have a very bad reputation. We can\u2019t let them take advantage of Uncle Luo\u201d.\u201cThen let\u2019s hurry.\u201d Hearing that, Mu Yu Die began to panic more.\u201cOk.\u201dZhao Xin nodded and said to Hu Long and Di Yalan, \u201cYou still need to encircle Miss Mu when we reach there. Put her safety in the first place, even during fights.\u201d\u201cRubbish! We all know this!\u201d Di Yalan was getting impatient.While muttering, the four quietly rushed toward Luo Hao.Shi Yan was not at all worried. He stood up after a few minutes.Feeling the vibrancy of his Profound Qi in the meridians, he at first moved his hands and feet slowly in order to make sure that they were still flexible after the fatigue. Then he followed the four people at leisure.\u201cWhoa!\u201d One man yelled in surprise, \u201cBeautiful girls, haha, there are two beautiful girls! I have lingered here for two months and have never seen such beautiful girls!\u201cCaptain, you had promised that you would let us be satisfied. Don\u2019t go back on your word.\u201d\u201cShut up! They are unavailable!\u201d\u2014Shi Yan walked up slowly, and began to look around with a rigid face.On the ground, was an eight metre long huge snake which had patterns of fire all over its body. Its tail was blazing and its body was covered with arrows. Meanwhile, a large quantity of blood was flowing out of the wound between its eyes.Eight mercenaries, in warrior uniforms, were standing around the Fire Snake. They looked robust and rough, and each of them got a tattoo of tush on their left arm. All of them were at least Nascent Realm.The captain\u2019s short brown hair stood like steel needles. There was a long scar on his left cheek which extended to his neck, making him look extremely savage.When Shi Yan arrived, those mercenaries were staring at Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan with lustful eyes. They looked rather infatuated.However, the captain was not looking at the girls at all, but exchanging glances with Luo Hao. The captain\u2019s right hand was at the cuff, where silver light was glowing now and then. He was prepared to have a fight.\u201cGo home and look at your mama!\u201d Under those mercenaries\u2019 salacious eyes, Di Yalan couldn\u2019t help cursing them.\u201cHaha! This woman has a fiery temper! I love it!\u201d An uncivilized mercenary with a bare and hairy chest burst into laughter. He patted his thigh and shouted, \u201cCaptain! I want this woman!\u201d\u201cSon of a bitch!\u201d Di Yalan drew out the sword beside her waist and posed to fight, \u201cCome on! Let me see if you are a real man!\u201d\u201cHaha, here I am!\u201d That big guy was joyful and was about to rush forward.\u201cTumu!\u201d Bernard shouted, then he lowered his voice, \u201cDon\u2019t make a fuss! Everything is negotiable!\u201d\u201cOk, Captain.\u201d That man with hairy-chest, whose name was Tumu, smirked and shook his legs to Di Yalan, and laughed cunningly, \u201cBitch, you will know how manly I am when we are naked.\u201d\u201cI will cut off your balls.\u201d Di Yalan shot back.Disgusted, Mu Yu Die frowned but didn\u2019t utter a word. She had gotten used to such remarks.\u201cWho let you come here?\u201d Luo Hao got a little worried. He knew those mercenaries well. These mercenaries, who stayed here to kill demon beasts, were leading an extremely dangerous life. They could be killed by demon beasts at any time.Under that stress, they didn\u2019t care much about morals or laws, and did a lot of nasty things.Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan were both pretty, and prettiness was the rarest thing in this area. The soft bodies of these pretty girls were the best comfort for those brutal mercenaries, so Luo Hao got a bad feeling at the sight of these men.Shi Yan came up and stood beside Luo Hao silently, and began to observe the Tush Mercenary Union.\u201cTumu!\u201d The scar-faced captain of the Tush Mercenary Union, Bernard, yelled out viciously, \u201cTake the things!\u201d At the same time, he was gazing at Luo Hao and Shi Yan with cold eyes, silver light glowing from the cuff.\u201cYes, Captain!\u201d Tumu stopped teasing Di Yalan and commanded his people to move. Thus, three mercenaries walked up with daggers. They operated on the Fire Snake with blood all over their bodies. Ripping the skin, gouging the eyes, pulling out the tusks. They were doing it carefully and skillfully.Bernard and the rest of the mercenaries kept staring at Luo Hao and others. They were all ready to assault them once Luo Hao made any move.Looking rigid, Luo Hao held his glowing broadsword and said, \u201cWe don\u2019t have a slightest interest in the Fire Snake. You are busy, we are going.\u201d Luo Hao knew Bernard was tough, so he don\u2019t want to ask for trouble. To bring Mu Yu Die to a safe place was most important.Seeing they were leaving, Bernard was a little stunned, as he called out, \u201cWait.\u201dLuo Hao got serious as he turned around. He said, \u201cHey buddies, I don\u2019t want to have a dispute with you guys. You guys don\u2019t go too far either.\u201d\u201cYeah well\u2026\u201d Bernard smirked, the muscles on his face relaxing, \u201cFriend, you got us wrong. I just want to make a deal with you. Nothing else.\u201d\u201cWhat deal?\u201d Luo Hao was surprised.\u201cWhat about one Fire Snake\u2019s eye, three tusks, and two metres snake skin for the two women?\u201d Bernard pointed at Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan, and smiled, \u201cMy people haven\u2019t touched women for a long time. They need to be satisfied. All women here have a price, and my offer is quite fair. What do you think?\u201d\u201cF***!\u201d Hu Long\u2019s eyes were almost on fire.Zhao Xin grunted. Mu Yu Die bit her teeth as well, while Di Yalan waved her sword and shouted, \u201cCome if you dare!\u201dOnly Shi Yan kept silent as he gazed at the captain.Luo Hao stretched out his hand to stop Di Yalan and shook his head to her. Then he turned around and said to Bernard, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; they are my friends, not my possessions. They can\u2019t be traded.\u201d\u201cWell, nevermind.\u201d Bernard nodded, and said casually \u201cSee you.\u201d\u201cSee you.\u201d Luo Hao looked into his eyes, then yelled, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dLuo Hao glared at Di Yalan, suggesting her to keep silent.Zhao Xin and Hu Long were both furious, but they could do nothing after seeing Luo Hao\u2019s eyes. They had to encircle Mu Yu Die and leave. Shi Yan touched his own nose and left without a word too.\u2014Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cCaptain, the same as usual?\u201d After Luo Hao and others disappeared into the woods, Tumu giggled, \u201cWe know what type of woman you like, so we won\u2019t touch that little girl. But that hot bitch, Captain, you have to give her to us.\u201dBernard\u2019s eyes got colder and colder, and he nodded gently, \u201cCollect the things on the snake first, and then do what we usually do!\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Tumu smirked, \u201cThat woman wanted to cut my cock! I would f*** her to death later!\u201d\u201cShe is a beautiful flower with thorns, and though lower than you, she is at The Third Sky of the Nascent Realm. You need to be careful. Don\u2019t fail miserably in an easy task.\u201d Bernard grunted. \u201cRemember to kill those men first, don\u2019t merely indulge yourselves in the woman. Be cautious, don\u2019t let anyone run away!\u201d\u201cYes, Captain!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Shit!\u201d\u201cNothing would have happened if you two didn\u2019t show up. Now we\u2019ve gotten ourselves into trouble. Alas.\u201d Luo Hao sighed and said, \u201cStop babbling. Let\u2019s leave. Hopefully we can escape it.\u201d\u201cUncle Luo, we\u2019ve already left, what\u2019s wrong?\u201d Mu Yu Die got confused.\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than what you think.\u201dLuo Hao shook his head, \u201cNone of those mercenaries are good men. That captain was so salacious when he looked at you that he wouldn\u2019t let it go easily. The four mercenaries operating on the snake appeared to be indifferent when we left, but they were much more interested in you, thus it\u2019s unreasonable that they would give up. They must know their captain\u2019s plan well.\u201dMu Yu Die\u2019s pretty face turned pale, \u201cUncle Luo, are you guessing that they would pursue us?\u201d\u201cNot a guess. I\u2019m very sure about it.\u201dLuo Hao sighed again, \u201cThey didn\u2019t take action at once, for they were considering the materials on the demon snake. Other warriors and mercenaries may have come up to collect their prey when they were fighting with us. So surely they will chase us after they get the material on the snake.\u201d\u201cThe Tush Mercenary Union have a really bad reputation. I have heard about them doing a lot of bad things. Uncle Luo is right.\u201d Hu Long added.\u201cUncle Luo, sorry\u2026 we were worried about you.\u201d Mu Yu Die was in low mood.\u201cI understand.\u201d Luo Hao replied. However, he suddenly stopped and put Mu Yu Die down gently.Thus, Shi Yan stopped as well. He asked while frowning, \u201cWhat happened? They are pursuing us?\u201dLuo Hao glanced at Shi Yan in appreciation and nodded, replying with a rigid face, \u201cMust be them.\u201d\u201cUncle Luo, what should we do now?\u201d Hu Long was furious and he yelled, \u201cThey went too far! Let\u2019s fight against them like hell!\u201dLuo Hao looked serious. He thought quickly and ordered, \u201cDi Yalan, carry Die and go first, and send signals to us all the way. Young man, you go with them, and be careful. Choose untraversed regions, and don\u2019t get into high-level demon beast areas.\u201d\u201cWhat about you?\u201d Shi Yan asked calmly.\u201cWe three will stay. Without Die amongst us, we can do sneak attacks easily. After delaying them, we will catch up. Those guys won\u2019t fight with us if they don\u2019t see the girls. They should stop soon.\u201d Luo Hao replied fast.\u201cGot it.\u201d Shi Yan nodded and smiled light-heartedly, \u201cDon\u2019t worry Uncle, where there are these two pretty girls, there will be me.\u201d\u201cOkay, go!\u201d Luo Hao replied.Di Yalan wanted to stay and fight, but she had to compromise under Luo Hao\u2019s firm gaze.She stamped on the ground with regret and crouched to carry Mu Yu Die. Then she ran to the thickest part of the forest.After some hesitation, Shi Yan took out a paper bag from his bag and put it in Luo Hao\u2019s hand, \u201cI got this poisonous powder by accident. It is called Seven Snake Saliva, which is made from poison fluid of seven types of snakes. It\u2019s very easy to use. Just wipe it on the weapon, and when it cuts even a little it will take effect\u2026\u201dBefore Luo Hao could say anything, Shi Yan smirked and advanced in the direction of Di Yalan.\u201cUncle Luo, wasn\u2019t it too mean? A warrior has his own self esteem. To use poison is contemptible.\u201d Zhao Xin frowned and looked at the poison powder in Luo Hao\u2019s hand with contempt, then he murmured, \u201cWe know nothing about that boy, and he\u2019s got so many vicious things. It\u2019s dangerous to let him stay with Miss Mu.\u201d\u201cZhao Xin, there are not many rules here, so cut the crap. We would have been dead bodies if it weren\u2019t for his Bone Chilling powder, and you wouldn\u2019t be here talking about righteousness.\u201dLuo Hao reproached angrily and said, \u201cEverybody gets to keep some powder, but don\u2019t use it too early in case it irritates those mercenaries. If it gets worse, don\u2019t hesitate to wipe it on weapons. You can reproach that boy again only when you two are still alive, understand?\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d\u2014In the woods.Bernard and his seven people were flying fast in the woods with cold faces and obscene smiles.\u201cShoo, shoo, shoo!\u201dArrows flew out from the woods one after another, hard and quick, which made the mercenaries stop and react.Bernard stopped at once and smirked. His right hand in the cuff finally stretched out- it was a shining silver iron hand! Rays of silver light exploded as the iron hand stretched out, and the light then divided into seven crescent knives in the air, and flew toward Luo Hao\u2019s hiding spot with a rush.\u201cKa ka ka!\u201dTree branches in the woods exploded, and fell one after another as the knives flew by. The knives let out frightening silver lights and bombarded heavily in the place where Luo Hao hid himself.\u201cBang bang bang!\u201dAn ancient tree collapsed suddenly after being cut by the knives. Luo Hao\u2019s figure showed up for a moment and disappeared into the woods again quickly.\u201cTumu, go ahead with Kinmo. We will take care of this side.\u201d Bernard smiled cunningly with his heavy face, and added, \u201cThe superior warriors are all here, while the women and that boy have run away. Remember, I need the women alive. If you kill them, you won\u2019t get even one crystal coin!\u201d\u201cBe at ease, Captain. I promise, I will bring that woman to you clean and beautiful, so that you can make her serve you however as you like.\u201d Tumu laughed loudly, \u201cKinmo, let\u2019s go first! Haha! That hot chick, haha, I will have her first. You are lucky today, you can taste her after me.\u201d\u201cYeah, I can\u2019t wait anymore!\u201d The ugly mercenary with pimples all over his face laughed too as he advanced with Tumu.\u201cIt\u2019s bad!\u201d Luo Hao was stunned, and was about to send a signal.He didn\u2019t presume that Bernard was so experienced with this kind of situation. Bernard saw through Luo Hao\u2019s plan at once and sent people to chase Di Yalan pointedly.\u201cStay here.\u201d Bernard sneered as he rushed to Luo Hao, \u201cMy friend, you wanted to delay us, didn\u2019t you? Now, I won\u2019t leave, so don\u2019t you leave as well. Let\u2019s trade blows and exercise our muscles.\u201dAs soon as Bernard moved, the other mercenaries separated too to search for Hu Long and Zhao Xin\u2019s traces.\u2014Carrying Mu Yu Die on her back, Di Yalan shuttled back and forth in the woods. Every time she touched the ground, her well-shaped long legs would pedal on the earth and thus her bonny body bounced several metres high, like a female leopard pursuing its prey.While up in the air, her short skirt under her armour flew with the wind, and her plump ass showed an attractive shape, looking extremely elastic.Shi Yan was staring at her figure joyfully and couldn\u2019t stop praising her hot body. No wonder those mercenaries couldn\u2019t get rid of Di Yalan in their mind.\u201cLittle bastard, stop looking at my ass! Take care of the surroundings! Keep an eye on any demon beast trails around here!\u201d Di Yalan seemed to have a pair of eyes on her back, as she shouted while running.\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Shi Yan broadened his mouth, \u201cThere are no trails of demon beasts for the time being, but it seems that someone is chasing us. I seem to hear their light steps.\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s after us?\u201d Di Yalan was stunned, \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be? The three including Uncle Luo are there. They weren\u2019t able to stop those crazy dogs?\u201dShi Yan then stopped, bent down, and leaned his ear against the ground. He said with a serious face, \u201cUncle Luo wasn\u2019t able to stop all the crazy dogs? Two of them are almost here?\u201dDi Yalan was astonished as she stopped in front, she observed with a pale face, \u201cKid, carry Miss Mu and leave fast. I will stay and fight with them.\u201d\u201cNo, I will stay.\u201dShi Yan shook his head, took a deep breath, answering in a low voice, \u201cI was just thinking about testing the results of my recent training. Keep going, I will catch up. Hmm, by the way, I will leave some signs as well, in case Uncle Luo Hao loses trace of us after dumping those mercenaries.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2026\u201d on Di Yalan\u2019s back, Mu Yu Die turned her head to Shi Yan and gazed at him numbly. Then a glow crossed her eyes, and she said with a complicated look on her pretty face, \u201cYou could have gotten out of this trouble, originally.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Shi Yan smiled, \u201cBut for you, I\u2019m in. I still owe you a lot. Once I pay it back, I will leave even if you ask me to stay.\u201d Waving his hand, he urged Di Yalan, \u201cSister, what the hell are you doing?! Move!\u201dDi Yalan felt it a little heartbreaking to see him again, so she turned her head away and said, \u201cLittle bastard, live on happily. If you can catch up again, I, I will allow you to touch my\u2026 butt.\u201d In an instant, she stamped on the ground and dashed out rapidly.\u201cHaha, then keep yourself clean and wait for me.\u201d Shi Yan laughed and shouted to her, \u201cI will be back soon.\u201dDi Yalan quivered, and almost fell. She gritted her teeth and cursed in her mind with blushed face, \u201cThis damn bastard!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were still discussing how to enjoy Di Yalan with salacious faces, while shuttling in the woods.\u201cShoo! Shoo!\u201dSharpened branches went through dense leaves and flew toward Tumu and Kinmo.Tumu didn\u2019t care about it at all. He wielded his axe aimlessly and chopped two tree branches down; then he laughed happily, \u201cLook at this guy, too shallow, haha. He treated us with these tree branches to lose our face?\u201d\u201cPoor guy.\u201d Kinmo shook his head and sneered.\u201cShoo! Shoo! Shoo!\u201dAnother three tree branches came over mightily.Tumu got a little impatient that he drew a semicircle in the air with his axe which was as long as an arm, and three tree branches fell on the ground in the silver light.Shi Yan showed up from among the bushes slowly and stared at them coldly, \u201cYou two will fight together, or come up one by one?\u201dNarrowing his eyes, Tumu raised his head and examined Shi Yan. Then he shook his head disappointedly, \u201cA young kid! Of the Nascent Realm at most! You talk big but have limited ability. Sorry, but I\u2019m not interested.\u201dAfter saying that, Tumu turned his eyes away from Shi Yan and walked away with his voice, \u201cKinmo, take care of it quickly. Catch up to me soon, or I will f*** that bitch twice. Hahaha!\u201dKinmo sniffed, then threw his huge wolf tooth stick onto the ground mightily, which stuck deep in the earth. \u201cKid, come down, I won\u2019t use my weapon, and don\u2019t let me climb the tree to catch you. I\u2019m in a hurry. Be quick.\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m in a hurry too.\u201d Shi Yan replied with indifference and calmness in his eyes. Then he jumped down the ancient tree at once, and threw his dagger out with all might into the earth beside that wolf tooth stick.\u201cBang!\u201d Shi Yan stood ten metres away in front of Kinmo, raised his hands and waved at Kinmo, \u201cI won\u2019t use a weapon either.\u201d\u201cHey kid, you\u2019re rather audacious!\u201d Kinmo broadened his mouth as all the pimples gathered on his face. With vicious eyes, he rushed toward Shi Yan at once.All of a sudden, Kinmo\u2019s hands swelled and blue veins popped on his fists. All his fists strikes were so heavy handed that they were making a \u2018hoooohooo\u2019 sound in the air. His aggressive assault created numerous images of the fists.After five steps, there appeared dozens of fist prints ahead of Kinmo.\u201cMortal Level Martial Skill, [Star Fists]!\u201dShi Yan narrowed his eyes and began to operate his Profound Qi calmly, clearing his mind of any other thoughts. There was only the fist images in his eyes and only the idea of \u201ckill Kinmo\u201d in his mind!\u201cBang!\u201dWith a heavy shake in his mind, he suddenly entered a different world.His eyes, ears and body suddenly got much more sensitive than before. All of the surroundings grew much clearer. Gazing at Kinmo, he could specifically sense the speed and rate at which Kinmo\u2019s Profound Qi flew in his arm.The fist images which had pervaded the air disappeared in an instant, and the air got clearer. Only Kinmo\u2019s waving fists were left in his eyes. Furthermore, he could even see the path his fists were traversing.After taking a deep breath, Shi Yan shouted and his arms contracted and dried at a speed which could be seen by naked eye. Soon his arms were twined with vague, white smoke.At the same time, from his neck, his skin began to petrify into grey rock, which looked as hard as iron.Dim black light spilled from his skin and covered all of his skinny body.Kinmo\u2019s iron fists, with the power to shatter rocks, struck toward Shi Yan\u2019s chest.The [Dark Light Shield] twisted, and after being struck by Kinmo\u2019s iron fists, it turned into dark light spots, exploding in an instant. Kinmo\u2019s fists went through the [Dark Light Shield], though with less power, and struck Shi Yan\u2019s chest heavily.\u201cBang!\u201d\u201cKaaar!\u201dThe sound of striking and bone breaking came at the same moment.Kinmo\u2019s face twisted at once.The nasty pain on his fists made Kinmo realize that it was not Shi Yan\u2019s chest, but his fists that had been splintered.Waving the painful arms with a hideous face, Kinmo looked at Shi Yan, who was as cold as a rock, rather terrified. He seemed to remember something at that moment, thus shouted, \u201cPetrifaction Martial Spirit from the Shi family! You are from the Shi family of the Merchant Union?\u201d\u201cBrilliant.\u201d Shi Yan smiled with coldness.Kinmo realized that he was at a disadvantage and thus tried to run, but it was too late since he was too close to Shi Yan.Shi Yan stretched out his hand like lightning and held Kinmo\u2019s neck. The white fog around his arm, containing all the negative emotions flew into Kinmo\u2019s body, all at once.Kinmo was so frightened that he felt himself fall into hell and screamed while quivering, \u201cNo! No! Nooooo!\u201dKinmo kept screaming hard and waved his iron fists aimlessly, as if he couldn\u2019t see a thing, and tried to defend from the ghosts which were approaching him.Shi Yan had released his hand a long time ago. The white smoke had disappeared and his face had returned normal. He was counting the time in his mind.One, two, three, four, five\u2026While counting, Shi Yan walked leisurely to where his dagger was struck. He pulled it out and walked over to Kinmo with light steps.When Shi Yan counted to seventeen, Kinmo seemed to be calming down gradually. His eyes were becoming clear and he was about to come around.Seventeen seconds was far more than enough to kill a person dozens of times.Nodding his head lightly, Shi Yan got to know more about the situation. He moved like lightening and slashed across Kinmo\u2019s neck with precision.Blood jetted out of his neck as Kinmo finally came back to his senses. He stared at Shi Yan in hatred and fell down with regret.Squatting down beside Kinmo, Shi Yan wiped off the blood on the dagger with Kinmo\u2019s coat, and examined Kinmo\u2019s body. He found some food, hundreds of purple crystal coins and the two sharp tusks of the Fire Snake.After putting these things into his bag without any hesitance, Shi Yan took a deep breath. He felt Kinmo\u2019s Profound Qi had all went into his own meridians. Then he stood up and murmured, \u201cSomeone at the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm would lose their senses for seventeen seconds under the negative power of [Rampage]. This Martial Skill is really too weird. Maybe, the more the negative power is concentrated, the stronger its power\u2026\u201dHe talked to himself for a while. Then he pulled himself together, took a deep breath and rushed in the direction where Tumu ran to.\u2014\u201cBitch! Too damn hot! Haha! But I love it!\u201d Tumu was laughing happily and having a fight with Di Yalan with his axe.Mu Yu Die\u2019s eyes were cold. Cuddling her zither, she looked panicked and seemed to make a difficult decision.The heavy axe looked light as a feather fan in Tumu\u2019s hand.As the axe shone now and then, Di Yalan\u2019s short sword was at a disadvantage. Once the short sword touched the axe, Di Yalan\u2019s thin body would shake. Apparently, Tumu had a much stronger Profound Qi than Di Yalan.Tumu\u2019s axe left shadows in the air as he wielded it, and the shadows entangled Di Yalan, like rings. Between the light reflected from the axe, Di Yalan\u2019s long hair flew up and down, and her short skirt was shredding, through which her thighs showed up now and then.\u201cBitch, you know my ability, huh? Don\u2019t worry, you will know soon that my best thing is not my Martial Skill. Hahaha!\u201d Tumu laughed with joy as he planned to defeat Di Yalan slowly. He was teasing her deliberately.Di Yalan was very furious, but she couldn\u2019t talk back and could only defend with every effort.\u201cSister, need any help?\u201d Shi Yan\u2019s casual banter came from the woods all of a sudden.The next moment, Shi Yan showed up with the dagger in his hand. He wandered his eyes over Di Yalan\u2019s thighs and butt, visible through the cracks on her skirt for a while and praised, \u201cRound and smooth, plump and cute. Too good! Terrific!\u201dDi Yalan was very surprised. Since she had no time to talk back now, she took a step back and answered loudly, \u201cYou bastard! How did you survive?\u201dTumu\u2019s face was frozen and pale. He didn\u2019t continue to chase after Di Yalan, but turned his head to Shi Yan and asked in a low voice, \u201cIs Kinmo dead?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Holding his dagger, Shi Yan walked toward him step by step, wearing a mysterious smile.As he was advancing, his arms dried up again. The negative power flowed out from his pores, and twined around his arms again.Kinmo\u2019s Profound Qi was not all purified, but as Shi Yan began to operate [Rampage], Kinmo\u2019s despair and hatred before his death suddenly gushed out from his meridians, forming the hideous shadow image in front of Shi Yan, which looked just the same as Kinmo.\u201cKinmo!\u201d Tumu was so astonished that his robust body quivered!Impossible!In front of Shi Yan, Kinmo\u2019s ghostly shadow which was as light as a feather was rattling his sabre. The dim eyes which were filled with hatred, showed that he would even want to kill all the people in the world.Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die were astonished too. With their thin bodies shaking, they couldn\u2019t help screaming, \u201cWhat the hell is that!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEven Shi Yan himself was astounded. Looking at the ghostly shadow in front of him, he didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201cKinmo! Kinmo! What happened to you?\u201d Under Kinmo\u2019s eyes which were full of unforgettable hatred, Tumu stepped back and shouted, \u201cI\u2019m your companion! You enemy is behind you!\u201dTumu\u2019s cry reminded Shi Yan. His will changed. Now there was only one thought in his mind; to kill Tumu. The negative power around his arms shot out like a weird, pale snake to Tumu.Kinmo\u2019s shadow seemed to be stimulated by the negative power and flew lightly towards him and brutally caught him.\u201cKill!\u201d Shi Yan yelled and rushed out. Surprised, Di Yalan raised her sword and struck toward Tumu too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 26 \u2013 The WagerTumu\u2019s face looked gloomy as he watched Kinmo\u2019s face with astonishment. He was frightened.That shadow did not have any substance but was like a ghost, which made Tumu, a brave and battlewise mercenary, apprehensive. He took a step back from this abnormal thing and tried to analyse the situation.Shi Yan immediately knew that Tumu was scared, as he stepped back. He took the right timing and rushed out with his dagger like a leopard. At the same time, he asked Di Yalan to fight together with him.Though Di Yalan was a little scared too, since she knew that ghostly shadow was released by Shi Yan, she plucked up courage to besiege Tumu.The pale, white light smoke, which contained refined negative power, began to intertwine Tumu. Kinmo\u2019s ghostly shadow was following it and went in front of Tumu at once.Tumu suddenly concentrated. Without any hesitation, he began to practice his dense Profound Qi of the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm with his secret formula. The Profound Qi gushed into his left hand and exploded into a red fire.In an instant, there appeared a red protective shield of concentrated pure Profound Qi in Tumu\u2019s left hand. That red protective shield was glowing with red light and letting out hot energy, though it was merely as big as a washbasin.This shield, created by pure Profound Qi, was apparently Tumu\u2019s vital Martial Skill, which required a lot of energy to operate.Just as the protective shield was produced, Tumu was already perspiring hard on his forehead. He must have consumed a lot of energy.The protective shield was sticking on Tumu\u2019s left hand. Seeing Shi Yan\u2019s negative power pouring toward him, Tumu immediately raised the shield to block the negative power and Kinmo\u2019s ghostly shadow.\u201cCheeee cheee cheee!\u201dThat strip of white fog containing negative mood, along with Kinmo\u2019s ghostly shadow sparkled after bumping on the protective shield.In the pervading sparkles, the white fog faded away and the ghostly shadow seemed to be melting and dispersed into the air bit by bit.Noticing the shield could melt these two weird things, Tumu became a little relieved. He then sneered cunningly, \u201cKid, let me see what else you\u2019ve got!\u201dA cold, evil air dispersed from the sparkles with the continuous sound of \u201cchee chee\u201d. Unnoticed by Tumu, the air went into his body through his pores.After that sneer, Tumu\u2019s face turned dumb and panic welled up from his eyes.A bright light crossed Shi Yan\u2019s eyes!According to Tumu\u2019s facial expressions, though Tumu had tried to clear the negative power, he couldn\u2019t wipe it all away. Some of it had already invaded his mind.\u201cTake action!\u201dAfter a loud yell, Shi Yan sped up to his maximum speed. He appeared in front of Tumu all of a sudden, leaving a light shadow in the open air.The dagger, with glowing blue light, stabbed toward Tumu\u2019s neck with a rush, which looked as if it was lightning.The protective shield in Tumu\u2019s hand was getting hotter and hotter. The temperature almost woke Tumu up from the numbness.Tumu opened his eyes abruptly!\u201cHaaaaooo!\u2019Tumu hauled, thus he suppressed all the negative emotions which had invaded his mind, at the same time, he drew a circle in the air with his axe in the right hand.\u201cKangchang!\u201dShi Yan\u2019s dagger stabbed into the axe while a nasty explosion came out from the axe. To his surprise, it rushed towards Shi Yan\u2019s arm through the dagger.Shi Yan\u2019s arm became so numb that he realized Tumu\u2019s Profound Qi was very dense, therefore he moved the dagger away from the axe quickly.Tumu didn\u2019t react to Shi Yan. Instead, he turned his body like wind and blocked Di Yalan\u2019s short sword which came behind him with his axe. He said with a cold face, \u201cI will f*** you as hard as I can!\u201dShi Yan grew rigid and the bloodthirstiness surged in his mind.Wielding his dagger, his muscles on the legs began to contract slowly as well. Negative power gushed out from his pores on the legs, covering them in a pale fog.As his hands and feet all went through the changes, Shi Yan couldn\u2019t control his bloodthirstiness any more.He was overwhelmed by the desire for killing, and his eyes were getting more and more red, while his expression became as hideous as a devil from hell. Even Mu Yu Die who was beside him was so frightened that she covered her mouth with her hand.\u201cHoooohoooo!\u201dShi Yan\u2019s breaths got heavier and heavier. He stomped and could feel endless power in his feet. His skinny body advanced ten meters in one second!Like a flying arrow. Fast and mighty!Tumu\u2019s axe flew swiftly in the air and made cracking sounds endlessly. It forced Di Yalan to retreat as her arms got more and more painful holding the short sword. She turned weaker and weaker under the severe attacks of Tumu\u2019s strong Profound Qi.A forceful, murderous air suddenly came from his back. Tumu had a hideous look in his eyes as he struck his axe again, making Di Yalan retreat while trembling.\u201cBang!\u201dTumu kicked his leg impatiently onto Di Yalan\u2019s smooth abdomen heavily and she was kicked about seven meters away.Di Yalan fell on ground on her back and she was bleeding severely from her mouth. Her Profound Qi was disordered and she lost all her strength at once.Tumu\u2019s kick contained a surging explosiveness as his Profound Qi exploded in an instant. He aimed to drain his fighting capacity slowly so that he could deal with Shi Yan.Turning around, Tumu brandished his axe with a vicious face. \u201cKid, I\u2019m gonna slice you into a hundred pieces!\u201dShi Yan ran up like an arrow and with the help of his impulses, he shifted all of his Profound Qi into his dagger.As he brandished his dagger, the shadows of the dagger fell like rain drops; along with it, a cold vicious power was sent out from the dagger and enveloped Tumu.\u201cHumph!\u201dTumu took a deep breath and began to wield the protective shield with his left hand. Warm wind flew out from the protective shield endlessly and drove the cold, vicious air away. Then he took up his axe and struck Shi Yan\u2019s dagger precisely.\u201cBang!\u201dWith the hard thump, Shi Yan felt a severe pain in his wrist, when his dagger suddenly flew out and fell down on the earth dozens metres away behind him.Tumu was having a hard time too. The power gushing out from Shi Yan\u2019s dagger was extremely vicious as well. As he defended from it, he retreated with a stagger.At the same time, an air of coldness, evil and panic, sprawled through his arms into the brain like a small snake and dragged him into a bloody atmosphere again.Shi Yan stood still as he saw Tumu\u2019 eyes become perplexed and retreated staggering into the direction of Di Yalan.At that moment, his dagger was dozens of meters away behind him. He would miss the best timing if he went to pick up his dagger and rush to Tumu; maybe Tumu would have come to his senses by then.That will flashed across in his mind like lightning and his eyes turned cold. Then he rushed to Tumu with all his strength and captured Tumu\u2019s waist with his arms. He pushed up with his legs and push Tumu toward Di Yalan with all might, and yelled, \u201cRaise your sword! Stab!\u201dOn hearing his shout, Di Yalan, who was lying on the ground exhausted, saw a huge dark shadow fall onto her.Without any hesitance, Di Yalan summoned all her strength and raised her short sword which was as long as her arm.\u201cPuuuuh!\u201dAs the sword stabbed into Tumu\u2019s heart, he woke up with a severe pain. He flailed crazily and tried hard to keep his balance.The sword stabbed into the back part of his heart thus his body tilted in the air, and he didn\u2019t fall onto Di Yalan immediately.With the support of the sword, Tumu kept that tilting position magically and didn\u2019t fall immediately, as if his legs had rooted in the ground.Tumu struggled with all his strength but only to find his hands held by Shi Yan tightly.Shi Yan looked rather cool, and he smirked, \u201cWild dog, you are done!\u201dKeeping that position, Tumu shouted, \u201cBastard! Let go of your hands! The sword stabbed me; it can also stab you! Let go of your hand! You want to die with me?\u201dTumu was really tough and he could still raise his leg like lightning under this situation. He kicked his knees into Shi Yan\u2019s belly heavily.Shi Yan injected his Profound Qi crazily into his arms. Since he couldn\u2019t activate the [Dark Light Shield], he tried to use the Petrifaction Martial Spirit.Tumu struck his knees into Shi Yan again and again. Under that heavy striking, the power of Petrifaction seemed to be concentrated in Shi Yan\u2019s abdomen, while the other parts of his body turned normal. His abdomen grew grey and was as hard as stone.Under the attacks of Tumu, who was at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm, Shi Yan could still support himself with the Petrifaction Martial Spirit. Though he felt extreme pain in his abdomen, he didn\u2019t spit out blood and his defensive power became abnormally strong.Di Yalan who was under them then came to notice that Shi Yan and Tumu were hugging tightly. If she thrust her short sword toward them, or Tumu fell down heavily, the sword would go through Tumu\u2019s body, and then into Shi Yan\u2019s body, sticking them together.Knowing that Shi Yan would be stabbed along with Tumu, Di Yalan didn\u2019t dare act rashly, so she screamed, \u201cBastard! Release!\u201d\u201cWild dog, I\u2019m shorter than you! But you will be the dead one, and I could only lose an arm at most!\u201dShi Yan looked at him coldly with a smile. Then with Tumu\u2019s frightened eyes, he threw Tumu and himself with all his might onto Di Yalan.\u201cPoooh! Poooh!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe sound of the weapon breaking the flesh and bone came one by one. Di Yalan was lying on her back, while Tumu was lying on her on his back, and Shi Yan on Tumu.The sword in her hand stabbed through both of them. It went through Tumu\u2019s heart, and then forced itself into Shi Yan\u2019s right shoulder.Tumu\u2019s heart was stabbed through. After several quivers, he died right away with an extremely terrified face.Though his shoulder was broken, Shi Yan looked hideous and still didn\u2019t let go of Tumu.After Tumu\u2019s Profound Qi spilled out of his body and flew into Shi Yan, the latter was convinced Tumu was dead. Then Shi Yan released his hands and laid his exhausted and soft body down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He drew many odd arcs in the air with his broadsword to tear the light net in front of him into pieces.Bernard looked normal and didn\u2019t show the slightest bit of fear. Yet he still kept a distance from Luo Hao and kept intertwining the silver light to form silver light nets one after another, throwing them towards Luo Hao.The silver light net was not influenced by the gravitational field. It was still floating in the air, and those which were torn by Luo Hao\u2019s broadsword stuck together again while floating and came around Luo Hao\u2019s body.Seen from afar, Luo Hao seemed to be in the very centre of a broken spider. In the shuttling of his broadsword, those light nets were torn and reconnected again.At the same time, Bernard still kept a proper distance from Luo Hao and never stopped producing more light nets to envelop Luo Hao, who was surrounded by more and more light nets.Bernard didn\u2019t let go of Luo Hao, apparently, he didn\u2019t need to use as much effort, as he smirked to Luo Hao. \u201cMy friend, why do you have to fight with me face to face? We just want the two women. My people have already followed them. Sure enough, the two women must have been taken away by my people. And you can\u2019t escape from my [Silver Net]. The results is very clear. Don\u2019t waste your time.\u201d\u201cIf they have an accident, I swear, I will sweep away your Tush Mercenary Union!\u201d With a twisted face, Luo Hao replied while in the light net, \u201cI will spend the rest of my life chasing you Tush Mercenary Union, till the last of you is killed!\u201dBernard was surprised; he took a deep breath and nodded, \u201cIt seems like I have to kill you now.\u201d\u201cCaptain! Captain!\u201d There came a surprised cry, \u201cJork\u2019s dead! He was just cut by a sword and was poisoned to death!\u201dBernard became furious, as he shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t be lenient! Kill them as soon as possible! Shit! Poison! Cut them into pieces and feed them to the demon beasts! Don\u2019t leave their bodies!\u201dThe mercenaries yelled together and began to chase Zhao Xin and Hu Long at the same time.Bernard was so angry that he operated the [Silver Net] with all his might to cover the whole area around Luo Hao, making a final bid for victory.Suddenly, lightning which was as thick as a finger turned into another huge net and fell from the sky, flying towards Luo Hao.Luo Hao was shocked and he turned pale at once. Though he tried hard to wave his broadsword, he couldn\u2019t cut down the new net.There were ten finger-like lightnings glowing an odd light as they twined like magic snakes.Frightened, Luo Hao immediately wielded his broadsword with all his Profound Qi. Then the broadsword generated a white light which grew into circles and entangled Luo Hao.\u201cCheee! Cheee!\u201dThose finger-like lightnings came toward Luo Hao. As they bumped into the white circles, electric flashes exploded at once.Luo Hao\u2019s loss of Profound Qi sped up several times compared to before!Under the fierce lightning, his energy was consumed quickly and his face turned extremely pale.A sharp sword suddenly appeared above his head, filled with the severe smell of slaughter, and struck on the circles surrounding Luo Hao\u2019s body.\u201cBang!\u201dLuo Hao\u2019s body shook greatly and crimson blood gushed out of his mouth. He staggered and stepped back.Bernard\u2019s [Silver Net] took advantage of this to wrap Luo Hao tightly so that he couldn\u2019t move at all.\u201cWang!\u201dThe sharp sword went through Luo Hao\u2019s body, and that Crescent Emissary with a pale mask on his face finally showed up.Alongside him was Mo Chaoge from the Mo family, who walked out from behind an ancient tree with lightning playing between his fingers.\u201cPooh!\u201d \u201cPooh!\u201d \u201cPooh!\u201dThe Crescent Emissary got a brutal look in his eyes, as his sharp sword went in and out of Luo Hao\u2019s body thrice.The gravitational field faded slowly\u2026\u201cUncle Luo!\u201dZhao Xin\u2019s eyes turned red and he cried in deep grief.Arrows flew toward Zhao Xin one after another. His body became like a hedgehog and he fell on ground and died with regret.On Hu Long\u2019s side, arrows were also flying around him. But they seemed to be not as accurate because instead of killing Hu Long, they blocked the people from the Tush Mercenary Union who were chasing Hu Long.Seizing this opportunity, Hu Long ran away crazily in the wood with red eyes. \u201cUncle Luo and Zhao Xin are dead. Only Miss Mu can avenge them. I must tell Miss Mu\u2026\u201d\u201cChase!\u201d The people from the Tush Mercenary Union yelled and began to chase, but only to find arrows falling down from the sky and blocking their way.They turned rigid and realized someone didn\u2019t want them to chase Hu Long, so they searched for that shooter with vicious eyes.Some people with pale masks appeared in the woods, and there were some warriors from the Mo Family among them; they were all having arrows with them and looked serious.\u201cWhy did you help me kill him?\u201d Frowning, Bernard asked Mo Chaoge and the other Star Emissary, \u201cI don\u2019t know you two, do I? What do you want from me for killing him?\u201d\u201cWe were not helping you.\u201d The Star Emissary walked up and glanced him with cold eyes, \u201cLuo Hao was an enemy of the Dark World that we were chasing him all this time. It\u2019s you who helped us.\u201dMo Chaoge was standing aside and not in a hurry to come up. He frowned and asked, \u201cEmissary, you said this is the strongest guy among those who were protecting that bastard. Since he is dead, we don\u2019t need to waste time anymore?\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d The Star Emissary nodded, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I left some Dark Moon Fragrance on Hu Long and ordered my people to let him go deliberately to become a guide for us. Later we can follow the trail left by the Dark Moon Fragrance and we can find the people we want.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Mo Chaoge started to smile, \u201cIt\u2019s not far from our Merchant Union. After it\u2019s done, would you like to have a cup of tea with the Mo family and discuss about the details of our cooperation, Emissary?\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d The Crescent Emissary nodded.In the past couple of days, the Crescent Emissary from the Dark World had already hooked up with Mo Chaoge, and they had come to a secret agreement.\u201cWhy did you kill this guy?\u201d Bernard waved his hand and soon his mercenaries crowded around him.\u201cFor a teenage girl, and a skinny boy.\u201d Mo Chaoge smiled, \u201cI\u2019ve known the Tush Mercenary Union for a long time. Now I know you why you really deserve such a reputation. I\u2019m Mo Chaoge from the Mo family of the Merchant Union. I wonder if you are interested in doing business with the Mo family?\u201d\u201cWhat kind of business?\u201d Bernard frowned.\u201cOf course money-earning kind! Haha! If you are interested, we can discuss the details. You will not regret it.\u201d Mo Chaoge laughed.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about it later.\u201d Bernard paused, and continued, \u201cIf there wasn\u2019t an accident, my people must have beaten the people you want. We can\u2019t do it for nothing. You take the teenage girl and the boy, and we, the Tush Mercenary Union, get that hot woman mercenary, okay?\u201dBernard knew they were tough people, and both the Dark World or Mo family from the Merchant Union have a huge influence.The Crescent Emissary and Mo Chaoge, who were in lead, were both at the Disaster Realm, not any lower than him, and those two had come to an agreement. After calculating, Bernard was sure that he could not compete with their joint power and had to step back.Mo Chaoge didn\u2019t reply, but looked to the Crescent Emissary from the Dark World.The Crescent Emissary\u2019s eyes flashed and he nodded slowly, \u201cNo Problem.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s go get them.\u201d seeing him nodding, Bernard became relieved. He had seen the brutality of those two people and he didn\u2019t dare ask for trouble.\u2014Mu Yu Die crouched and bound up the wound for Shi Yan carefully.With a rigid face, Shi Yan was silent. He sat on the ground and examined the change in the wound on his shoulder, and the purification of Tumu\u2019s Profound Qi in his meridians. He was so focused that he didn\u2019t even take a glimpse at Mu Yu Die.\u201cSometimes he is so lustful, and sometimes he is so righteous, too weird\u2026\u201dMu Yu Die questioned secretly, as generally in recent days, Shi Yan looked at her so audaciously without any disguise.But now they were so close and could even smell the scent on each other, Shi Yan didn\u2019t even look at her. She was rather confused.Mu Yu Die was so perplexed and she was not sure about Shi Yan\u2019s real personality.Narrowing his eyes, Shi Yan concentrated on the changes occurring inside his body.The cells of the wound on his shoulder were very alive. Without doing anything, he could sense they were recovering gradually with the aid of the Immortal Martial Spirit.After Tumu\u2019s Profound Qi was purified in his meridians, the odd negative emotions were generated secretly within them.After operating [Rampage], he didn\u2019t have the slightest amount of strength in his limbs and they ached a lot, seemingly not recovering in a short time. This familiar side effect made him uncomfortable but he could do nothing.Di Yalan, who was resting not far from them, regained her spirit and began to search Tumu\u2019s body.One minute later, Di Yalan walked to Mu Yu Die and Shi Yan with a little bag. \u201cThere is some food on this guy, some demon beast materials, and three Star Bombs. We don\u2019t need the demon beast materials, but the Star Bombs are rather brutal.\u201d\u201cStar Bombs?\u201d flash crossed Shi Yan\u2019s eyes and he stared at the green balls which were as big as fists. He asked with a lot of interest, \u201cWhat are they for?\u201d\u201cIt will explode once shaken and produce starry blades, which are very sharp and would fly in all directions. The impact is so strong that even a Profound Qi shield from a Human Realm warrior couldn\u2019t prevent it. It\u2019s a type of brutal treasure and is very expensive. These three may cost five thousand of black crystal coins!\u201d Di Yalan explained.\u201cToo brutal!

She had only survived until now because of Luo Hao who was like her spirit.Hearing that Luo Hao and Zhao Xin were both dead, Mu Yu Die was filled with so much grief that she didn\u2019t even want to think about escaping.Di Yalan\u2019s eyes were almost on fire as she clenched her teeth and asked in trembling voice, \u201cWho the hell did that?\u201dHu Long choked with sobs, and quickly explained the details, then he added, \u201cApart from the Dark World and the Tush Mercenary Union, there were also people from the Mo family from the Merchant Union. That guy released the power of lightning which was not refined from Profound Qi; it should be the Lightning Martial Spirit of the Mo family.\u201d\u201cThe Tush Mercenary Union! Dark World! Mo family!\u201d Di Yalan clenched her teeth and uttered word by word! Then she yelled, \u201cThey all must pay for that!\u201dShi Yan frowned as he heard about the Lightning Martial Spirit. He realized quickly that the target of Mo family was him!An odd scent suddenly went into Shi Yan\u2019s mouth and nose, which made him stand up quickly and walk around Hu Long. He turned pale and said, \u201cBrother Hu Long, you have a strange fragrance on your body\u2026 you shouldn\u2019t have escaped alive\u2026 ahh\u2026\u201d\u201cKid, what do you mean?\u201d Di Yalan stared at him, \u201cYou wish Hu Long was killed?\u201dBut Hu Long realized what he meant after a thought, and he answered with a bitter smile, \u201cSo it is. They didn\u2019t kill me because they wanted to find you. I thought I got lucky. Haha.\u201dThen, before Di Yalan could stop him, Hu Long kneeled down in front of Mu Yu Die and kowtowed three times; he said, \u201cMiss Mu, please live on happily and avenge us!\u201dHe then stood up and ran away quickly as his lamenting voice came afar, \u201cLeave soon! Take the other way! I will distract them and earn as much time as possible for you!\u201d\u201cHu Long!\u201d Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die wailed loudly.\u201cWe should leave right now! Miss Mu, remember the grief and live on well!\u201d Shi Yan looked serious as he stretched out his hand to Di Yalan, \u201cGive the Star Bombs to me. You leave with Miss Mu. I will catch up to you soon.\u201dDi Yalan\u2019s mind became blank because of her friends\u2019 deaths. She was dumbstruck for a while, then she handed the three Star Bombs to Shi Yan, and asked in husky voice, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cFor now, to ask for some interest for Uncle Luo!\u201dShi Yan went up to Tumu\u2019s body quickly with an icy face and cut open Tumu\u2019s belly with his dagger and then put two Star bombs inside it. After that, Shi Yan wiped the Seven Snake Saliva on the belly carefully, and turned over Tumu\u2019s body; now his body was lying face down.\u201cPeople get curious. Once the people of Tush Mercenary Union come, they won\u2019t be able to help but turn over Tumu\u2019s body they see him like this. Thus the Star Bombs will explode. Guess what will happen if his body was turned over heavily?\u201d Shi Yan smirked.\u201cI got it.\u201d Di Yalan looked vicious too, \u201cThe more of them being killed, the better!\u201d\u201cI also put some poisonous powder on his body. After the Star Bombs explode, the powder will stick to the blades and once the blades cut people, they will definitely die!\u201d Shi Yan looked cold, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we should live on! Or else we can\u2019t avenge Uncle Luo!\u201d\u201cI hope Hu Long is fine.\u201d Mu Yu Die murmured with hazy eyes.Shi Yan was a little sad, for he knew there was no possibility of Hu Long surviving. Still, he comforted her, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, our trap may damage them badly. Maybe we can still meet up with Hu Long.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dMu Yu Die asked weakly; though she knew it was not realistic, she still wished someone could give her an answer, even if it was a lie.\u201cSure, he will be alright.\u201d Shi Yan nodded with certainty, and made eye contact with Di Yalan.Di Yalan understood what he meant, as she carried Mu Yu Die and ran into the woods.Shi Yan took a deep breath, summoned all of his energy and caught up in a hurry.\u2014A quarter of an hour later.The three parties; the Dark World, the Mo family and the Tush Mercenary Union, appeared together. They reached here by following the scent on Hu Long.\u201cTumu!\u201dAt the sight of the axe beside the body, Bernard realised at once that it was Tumu! He was so shocked that he cried, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible! How could they kill Tumu!?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you say we would just need to collect the people we want when we get here?\u201d the Crescent Emissary grunted with cold eyes, \u201cLuckily I had left the Dark Moon Fragrance on that guy, or else we would\u2019ve needed to search for them everywhere.\u201dBernard was rather confused as he ordered, \u201cZuo Song, turn Tumu over and check him.\u201d\u201cIt was that boy who killed him!\u201d Mo Yanyu reminded Mo Chaoge in a very low voice, \u201cEveryone who was killed by him will be drained. There must be poison on that boy\u2019s weapon!\u201d\u201cThat boy is something.\u201d Mo Chaoge nodded and reminded her, \u201cBe careful later. Don\u2019t become impulsive.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201dAs they were talking, Zuo Song, a member of the Tush Mercenary Union, had already run to Tumu\u2019s body on Bernard\u2019s order.Zuo Song grasped Tumu\u2019s shoulder and turned his body over, and was just about to examine it\u2026\u201cThud!\u201dThe back of Tumu\u2019s body kicked on the ground heavily.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dA severe blast exploded out!Tumu\u2019s body ruptured into thousands of pieces in an instant!Thousands of blades mixed within Tumu\u2019s flesh and blood flew out from his body like stars!As the blast was unexpected, those blades covered with flesh and blood shot toward everybody directly.As the Tush Mercenary Union stood closest to Tumu, they were hit first!Due to the flying blades, three mercenaries turned into honeycombs, with bloody holes appearing all over their bodies.Zuo Song, who had turned Tumu over, was blasted apart and his flesh and blood was mixed with Tumu\u2019s, flying in all directions.The Dark World Emissaries and people from Mo family didn\u2019t expect such a development, and thus they also didn\u2019t escape from it!Though they were dozens of metres away, the warriors were injured as well, especially those of the Elementary Realm from the Mo family. They were cut by blades before they could defend themselves.Miserable screeches continued. The blast from the two Star Bombs made it hell in this area. Flesh and blood filled the air. Limbs and entrails were spread all over on the ground.Amidst the terrifying howls, everybody was panic-stricken.Seeing that picture, Mo Yanyu, who was protected by Mo Chaoge, couldn\u2019t stand anymore. She turned pale and vomited.Some warriors from the Dark World and Mo family were only cut by blades; they thought themselves lucky. But soon they felt pain in their body and began to lose their vision\u2026\u201cDamn it! Poison on the blades!\u201d Mo Chaoge looked as if been stomped on by someone. He stared at the warriors from Mo family and shouted, \u201cCut off your wounded flesh! Fast! Fast!\u201dThe huge man Johnson\u2019s arm was cut by a blade, so it was bleeding badly.Johnson was so terrified that he clenched his teeth and cut half of his left arm off. He howled and kneeled down, \u201cMiss Mo, please bind this up for me!\u201d\u201cOu!\u201dWhen Mo Yanyu stood up and saw Johnson\u2019s dismembered arm, she got sick and began to vomit again.Looking at the flesh, entrails, limbs and green bodies on the ground, Bernard boiled with rage, and his eyes were filled with murderous desire. He will eat whoever did all this alive!Among them, the Dark World lost three people, while the Mo family lost five.Since Bernard was closest to Tumu, he suffered the biggest loss, for all his people were dead! He was on his own now!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill them! I\u2019m gonna kill them! I\u2019m gonna kill them!\u201d Bernard kept howling like a crazy demon beast.\u201cHumph!\u201d The Crescent Emissary grunted and said to Mo Chaoge, \u201cLet\u2019s keep chasing. Leave him alone.\u201dHe lost people and blamed Bernard for it. If Bernard didn\u2019t order Zuo Song to turn over Tumu\u2019s body, there wouldn\u2019t be such a crazy blast.\u201cLet\u2019s keep chasing.\u201d Mo Chaoge nodded and left with the people from the Dark World, not bothering to deal with Bernard, who was raving like a lunatic.\u201cI will kill them!\u201d Bernard panted as he looked in the direction where the Dark World and Mo Family people went. After a long while, he chased after them with a murderous look.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 29 \u2013 Eating Human FleshIn the thick forest, while carrying Mu Yu Die on her back, Di Yalan was moving with Shi Yan.Being on alert, Shi Yan was observing the surroundings carefully. Once he found trails of demon beasts, he would tell Di Yalan in advance; thus she could change her direction to avoid meeting demon beasts.Time flew by. Quickly it became dark and there was the bright moon hanging in the sky.Terrible howls could be heard in the serene forest now and then. Those demon beasts who loved to move around at night began to hunt at this time after resting during the day.And at night, Shi Yan\u2019s eyesight worsened, making it hard for him to distinguish a safe area from a demon beast occupied area.Some demon beasts didn\u2019t even make a sound when they were hunting.Thus, where there were howls of demon beasts would be an unsafe place; but where there were no howls, didn\u2019t mean it was safe either. It might be hiding an even greater danger!After three hours of running, Di Yalan and Shi Yan were both tired.Though they killed Tumu together at dusk, they paid a price. Di Yalan had lost too much Profound Qi defending against Tumu\u2019s fierce attack, and she continued consuming her energy by running non-stop in the woods with Mu Yu Die on her back.Di Yalan was extremely exhausted now. It was only her strong willpower that was supporting her along.Shi Yan was in no better state either, his shoulder was wounded, and though it was bound up and the Immortal Martial Spirit was helping him recover, it still needed more time.The side effect of operating [Rampage] was a great loss of energy. Also, Kinmo and Tumu\u2019s Profound Qi which he had absorbed was still being purified, and the desire for blood was welling up now and then, but he still needed to observe the surroundings cautiously.He was even more tired than Di Yalan.\u201cLet\u2019s have a rest.\u201d Mu Yu Die advised softly. According to Di Yalan\u2019s heavier steps and slower actions, Mu Yu Die realized that she was going to hit her limit soon.\u201cOk.\u201d Shi Yan took a breath and replied calmly, \u201cLet me find a comfortable place.\u201dImmediately, he climbed up an ancient tree like a monkey to find dense foliage to hide himself.Standing on that ancient tree, Shi Yan was examining the surroundings. Dancing from tree branch to tree branch, he moved to a nearby withered tree.The ancient tree had thick, dry trunk: it must have been dead for years.Shi Yan examined the dry branch of that withered ancient tree, and was surprised, \u201cThis tree is hollow from the inside, and its bottom is spacious enough for us three to sit down. A good place. You two have a rest first, then come up.\u201dThe upper part of that ancient tree was thin and was only wide enough for one person to slip in, but its bottom was rather thick. It was ten metres tall, which was easy for Shi Yan and Di Yalan to slip down, and also wide enough for Mu Yu Die to climb with the help of a rope.Hearing that there was such a good place, Di Yalan couldn\u2019t bear it anymore, and urged, \u201cThen let\u2019s get in soon. Demon beasts haunt this area. If we bump into one, it would become trouble.\u201d\u201cOk, hand that rope to me. I will pull Miss Mu up first.\u201d\u2014Two minutes later.The three of them sat down together in the hollow bottom of that ancient tree trunk.The starlight fell into the empty center of the trunk. Outside, the demon beasts were howling ominously.There was total silence inside.Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan were filled with agony.All along the way, those two had stuck with Luo Hao and helped each other through many difficulties. But now, only the two of them were alive, and it was still uncertain if they could survive.Their friends had died and bad guys kept chasing. Maybe tomorrow the people of the Dark World and the Tush Mercenary Union would catch them and harass them\u2026The feeling of hopeless for tomorrow made Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan quite worried.Shi Yan\u2019s state was better, for he hadn\u2019t been together with Luo Hao for a long time, so he wasn\u2019t so emotional. Although the three of them died, he felt far from grieved and could still think straight.Well, he also felt regret for Luo Hao\u2019s death. Luo Hao had treated him well and had trained him within his gravitational field every night, which consumed a lot of Luo Hao\u2019s energy. He owed Luo Hao a lot.Especially when he heard Luo Hao\u2019s death was connected to the Mo family, he thought he should take responsibility.He engraved the three parties; the Dark World, the Tush Mercenary Union and the Mo family, in mind and was determined to take revenge someday.After glancing at Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die, Shi Yan frowned. They looked dull and hopeless, without any fighting spirit.He knew they were hurt deeply by Luo Hao\u2019s death, but it was still a long way to the Merchant Union; they wouldn\u2019t survive if they lost their fighting spirit!Pondering for a while, Shi Yan considered doing something. Gazing at them, he came up with an idea\u2026In the center of the hollow tree, the three of them sat down cross-legged. However, due to limited space, when the three of them all sat together, there was only a small space between them. Their legs were so close to each other that they could even feel the warmth from each other\u2019s body.At first, Shi Yan kept his legs together, with a tiny gap between his and the legs of the other women.But he suddenly spread his legs a little, with his left leg touching the leg of Di Yalan, and his right leg touching the leg of Mu Yu Die. He could clearly feel the difference between the muscles of the two women. One\u2019s thigh was strong and solid, while the other\u2019s was smooth and soft; he liked both of them.Shi Yan\u2019s little action seemed unintentional, but the two girls both had reaction in their bodies.Di Yalan raised her head and glared at him, but didn\u2019t say anything. However, Mu Yu Die was apparently a little embarrassed. She blushed, and she tried to move her left leg secretly in order to keep a distance from Shi Yan\u2019s right leg.But every time she moved her leg, Shi Yan would move his right leg as well, taking every opportunity to touch her soft leg.After several times, Mu Yu Die was a little irritated. She realized that Shi Yan was doing this on purpose to take advantage of her, but there was nothing she could do. Her face turned red and she blushed, calling Shi Yan a bastard in secret.But due to the drama with Shi Yan, Mu Yu Die forgot her sorrow for a while. She was so focused on cursing Shi Yan that she forgot the terrible death of Luo Hao and others.On the other side, Di Yalan saw through the little tricks Shi Yan was playing with Mu Yu Die. She seemed to have realized something, and so she didn\u2019t jump up to stop him. On the contrary, she was staring at Mu Yu Die with a mocking look, as if she was saying that Mu Yu Die was taking this too seriously.Noticing Di Yalan\u2019s look, Mu Yu Die was even more embarrassed, and her face was becoming even redder. She was so angry on the inside that she rolled her eyes at Shi Yan with a look of shame.Shi Yan closed his eyes, pretending that he was not doing all this on purpose. He breathed in and out naturally, as if he was sleeping.\u201cEndure! Endure it! I won\u2019t let you go peacefully when I recover!\u201d Mu Yu Die was cursing Shi Yan on the inside. She could feel Shi Yan\u2019s body temperature on her skin, and her face had turned completely red. But all she could do was to curse him on the inside.Of course Shi Yan wasn\u2019t sleeping.With his eyes closed, he was feeling and comparing the touch of their thighs. The muscles on Di Yalan\u2019s leg was strong and vigorous, while Mu Yu Die\u2019s felt soft and bouncy. Both of them were so attractive. After comparing for a while, Shi Yan decided that both of their thighs felt good. He felt so wonderful that he could barely tell which of them was better.However, while he was focusing on comparing those thighs, Shi Yan started to feel a burning sexual arousal. His primitive desires were out of their cage.From within his meridians, threads of negative energy started to seep out secretly. Shi Yan could feel his pants getting tighter and tighter.His breath became shorter and shorter. From deep within, he didn\u2019t have the crazy desire for killing. Instead, he could only feel one simple, but strong desire. The more he suppressed his lust, the more he was about to lose control.Shi Yan lost control of himself gradually\u2026Mu Yu Die suddenly noticed this change. She called out in a low voice, \u201cSister Lan, this guy looks a little strange. It seems\u2026 it seems he is returning to the beast he used to be.\u201dShi Yan was breathing heavily, with sweat covering his forehead. His body was trembling slightly. It looked like he was trying very hard to fight something from the inside.Because the two, Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die, were sitting next to him with their thighs touching each other, they both noticed the strange reaction on Shi Yan\u2019s body.Glaring at Shi Yan for a moment, Di Yalan blushed as she said, \u201cThis time he is different. He wanted to kill before, but now he\u2026 he\u2026\u201d\u201cNow what?\u201d Mu Yu Die was confused.\u201cNow he wants to eat human flesh\u2026\u201d Di Yalan answered briefly. She looked a little embarrassed as well, and couldn\u2019t finish her sentence with a more detailed explanation.\u201cEat human flesh?\u201d Mu Yu Die\u2019s face turned white as she heard this. She screamed with terror, \u201cThis is even worse! How come? Will he also turn into those demon beasts? Sister Lan, is he gonna eat us both? What should we do?\u201dApparently she didn\u2019t understand Di Yalan.\u201cYou silly girl, what are you thinking about!\u201d Di Yalan cursed with embarrassment, \u201cHe is turning into a horny beast.\u201dMu Yu Die froze for a while before she realized something. Her pretty face got even redder. She mumbled, \u201cSister Lan, just let me play the zither for a while to help him release his energy. How about you go out for a while? I\u2026 I want to go out as well.\u201d\u201cOK, I will show you out.\u201d Di Yalan nodded. Her eyes lit up with a flash of light, and was about to fly up\u2026Just then!Shi Yan suddenly opened his eyes. With bloodshot eyes, he grabbed Di Yalan like a horny beast.The tree hole was not that big. When she was pinned by Shi Yan, Di Yalan could barely move her beautiful body. There was no way she could escape.\u201cBastard! Take your hands off me!\u201d Di Yalan screamed, \u201cYou dumb girl, pull him away! Quick!\u201dMu Yu Die was taken over with panic. She tried to pull Shi Yan away, but his body was as heavy as a rock. No matter how hard she tried, his body just wouldn\u2019t move.Di Yalan was extremely exhausted these days. With her Profound Qi not yet recovered, she could barely struggle against Shi Yan\u2019s beastly force.\u201cChi-la!\u201d A loud sound of clothes being torn broke the silence in the tree hole.Di Yalan felt a little chilly around her hip. She instantly realized that her leather skirt was gone. But before she could even defend, she felt a giant hand reaching between her thighs and rubbing her hip insatiably.\u201cBastard!\u201d Di Yalan couldn\u2019t help but scream. She shouted to Mu Yu Die, \u201cQuick! Stop him! He has been overtaken by his genitals! \u201d\u201cI, I can\u2019t stop him.\u201d Mu Yu Die punched on Shi Yan\u2019s back with all her might and cried out in panic.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d With her sensitive parts being touched and rubbed by those fingers, Di Yalan gradually lost her defenses. She couldn\u2019t find any strength to fight back, and couldn\u2019t help moaning. Her arms gave up the fight as well.Mu Yu Die was astonished. She whispered in a low voice with blushed face, \u201cSister Lan, why\u2026 why are you screaming?\u201d\u201cI am not screaming. Do something, ouch\u2026\u201d Di Yalan felt weaker and weaker, and her voice were getting softer as well.\u201cSister Lan, it\u2019s too la\u2026 late!\u201d Mu Yu Die mumbled with her eyes filled with fear.\u201cWha\u2026 What\u2019s too late?\u201d Di Yalan was stunned.The next moment, she felt a hard thing inside her body. With her body trembling with the thrill, Di Yalan realized that it was too late to put on a fight.A miraculous feeling pervaded in her body and drowned her sanity\u2026Aw well, well, maybe we will all be dead tomorrow. I will just let you take me this time.The continuous pounding she felt from that guy had completely crushed her defenses, both physically and mentally. Di Yalan covered her mouth with one hand. She couldn\u2019t help but scream with pleasure, as Shi Yan continuously twitched inside of her.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMu Yu Die\u2019s pretty face was covered in panic. She stood there like a statue, watching the two of them getting all sweaty.Right in front of her, Shi Yan was working hard on Di Yalan. Apparently, under his mighty force, Di Yalan couldn\u2019t put on much fight. She gradually got lost in his passion as well, and even moved her hips to match Shi Yan\u2019s rhythm.\u201cYou, you, you two\u2026\u201dMu Yu Die\u2019s pretty face was also bloodshot. She couldn\u2019t do anything but stare at the two of them lying within such a narrow space, doing it right in front of her eyes. The hot picture of them was mind blowing for her.Mu Yu Die was dumbstruck, and didn\u2019t know what to do at all.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even with his eyes closed, he could instantly tell what he had been doing.He had one hand on Di Yalan\u2019s hips, pulling her alluring body tightly towards him, and the other hand lingering on her extraordinary bosoms, rubbing and squeezing.That hot body of Di Yalan\u2019s was completely under his control. She was all over his body like a snake. Her eyes were lost in the passion, with sweet sweat all over her body; she couldn\u2019t help but move along with his rhythm, only to bring him more excitement and pleasure.Many thoughts were speeding through Shi Yan\u2019s mind, but his eyes remained shut. Neither did he move his hands roughly. He continued to work his lower body on that woman, and took every moment to enjoy this wonderful experience.Compared to the rough actions he had before, after he regained his sanity, Shi Yan slightly slowed down his movements with a softer touch, yet with way more masterful skills.His hands were blessed by magic. When he moved those hands on Di Yalan\u2019s body, he knew exactly which spots to work on, triggering an even bigger reaction in her body.Suddenly, Di Yalan\u2019s body was flipped around, with her impressive breasts pressed tightly against the tree while her hips were thrust towards Shi Yan. She lifted her plump hips up, shaking and swinging it back and forth, enjoying Shi Yan\u2019s whipping in a new position.Mu Yu Die was totally embarrassed and blushing. She leaned her fragile body onto the other side of the tree. Her beautiful eyes were lingering and staring at the two of them doing it.With his eyes shut, Shi Yan was totally enjoying the moment. He had let his most primitive desires out of his body, which seemed to have sped up the purification process of the Profound Qi in his meridians.Di Yalan was already lost in his passion, doing nothing but coordinating with Shi Yan\u2019s movements.Before long, Shi Yan felt a strong wave of pleasure flooding towards his brain, completely out of his control. Together with that thrilling excitement, he could feel a most wonderful power start pouring out of his meridians and rushing into his body.When that strange power reached his abdomen, it split into two parts. One poured into his Profound Qi, while the other part blended with his essence and shot into Di Yalan\u2019s body with his coming climax.With the short gasps of the sweaty man and woman, Mu Yu Die lost all her strength. She fell down onto the ground, breathing heavily as her whole mind went completely blank.\u2014Shi Yan slowly moved away from Di Yalan. He pulled up his pants, sat down in silence and started to operate the Profound Qi inside his body.Di Yalan had lost all her strength as well, lying weakly on the ground, her whole body shining with a sexy red color. She only came to her senses after a while. She put on her leather skirt with a red face and slowly sat down.The three of them returned to their original positions, sitting together in the tree with crossed-legs.Mu Yu Die was the first to regain her calm. Although her face was still a little red, she moved her beautiful eyes between Shi Yan and Di Yalan, as if expecting something from them.Shi Yan looked calm on the outside. He kept his eyes closed, and focused his attention on the strange power he felt in his Profound Qi during his orgasm. He was guiding this power within his Profound Qi slowly through his body. He wouldn\u2019t want to miss any opportunity to enhance his power.Di Yalan hadn\u2019t opened her eyes yet, but she knew that Mu Yu Die was staring at her the whole time. Out of shame, she didn\u2019t dare to open her eyes and look up. She was so ashamed that she just wanted to bury herself in the ground.Shi Yan had forced himself on her inside this tree, right in front of Mu Yu Die. However, she didn\u2019t put up much of a fight. Even worse, she was actually enjoying it during the process. She felt so ashamed of herself. Despite being a casual and bold girl, she knew this craziness was totally out of line for her. She was too ashamed to face Mu Yu Die.Right about that time, a strange excitement slowly rose and spread from the sensitive parts of her lower body. Di Yalan couldn\u2019t help but tremble, and almost moaned again.She anxiously twisted her body, secretly calling herself a slut, and quickly concentrated her attention on the change that was going on in her body.After some observation, Di Yalan felt that the strange power inside of her had turned into two streams. One stream was flowing slowly towards her abdomen, while the other part had settled around her chest and her flesh and muscles, which seemed to have altered the parts around her chest in secret.She could clearly feel her bones and flesh, muscles and vessels around her chest going through some incredible changes which she couldn\u2019t explain.That strange energy, mixed with her Profound Qi, had been pouring into her abdomen, driving out a strong wave of power from within.Her Profound Qi had suddenly been enhanced enormously!Di Yalan couldn\u2019t help but exclaim. She quickly concentrated on dealing with her refreshed Profound Qi, operating it through a specific path through her body.\u2014The bright moonlight was shining into the tree, and lit up the tiny space inside.Shi Yan slowly woke up, breathing slowing in and out with a calm rhythm.He had reached the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm!With the help of that strange power, Shi Yan had enhanced himself to the next level, and successfully reached the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm.After he woke up, Shi Yan found the wound on his shoulder didn\u2019t hurt that much. With the help of the Immortal Martial Spirit, the broken bones and muscles were slowly regenerating and recovering themselves on their own.With this speed, it would only take a few days before he had fully recovered.When he slowly opened his eyes, Shi Yan noticed a bright pair of eyes staring straight at him. But when he looked back, those beautiful eyes quickly looked away.\u201cMiss Mu, how come you are still awake?\u201d Shi Yan said with a calm voice, with nothing strange showing on his face.Seeing Shi Yan looking back at her, Mu Yu Die was so embarrassed that she quickly looked away. She turned her face away with a blush to avoid eye contact, and said in a joking tone, \u201cYou two were making such loud noises. How is it possible for me to fall asleep?\u201d\u201cOh, so sorry to disturb you. I will remember that next time.\u201d Shi Yan laughed with embarrassment and defended himself with a natural explanation, \u201cThere must be something wrong with my body. Something odd happened to me and destroyed my sanity. There\u2019s nothing I could do about it. Sorry.\u201d\u201cSo you mean you were unconscious during the whole time?\u201d Mu Yu Die said with a grin on her face, \u201cI was watching you two doing it. At first you were, but afterwards\u2026. afterwards you couldn\u2019t have been unconscious! Otherwise\u2026 otherwise, you wouldn\u2019t be able to\u2026 to do that kind of thing\u2026\u201dMu Yu Die was too shy to continue her sentence. She was right there when Shi Yan pulled out all those tricks on Di Yalan.No one in their unconscious mind would be able to play all those sexual tricks or remember all those different kinds of sexual positions, right in the middle of being insane. Therefore, Mu Yu Die was certain that Shi Yan had come to his senses way before he finished on Di Yalan.\u201cErr\u2026\u201d Shi Yan was completely speechless for a while. He sat frozen there for some time and put on an embarrassing smile, \u201cSo Miss Mu, have you have been watching us doing it the whole time? Then please spare my rude actions. I know that I am a real bastard.\u201d\u201cYou! How can you be so shameless?\u201d Mu Yu Die got so angry that she hit Shi Yan hard on his thigh, making Shi Yan scream and beg for mercy.Seeing Shi Yan suffering and screaming, Mu Yu Die felt a little better. She turned around and saw Di Yalan was also sitting there in silence with her eyes closed. However, her face was also carrying a shiny blush.Mu Yu Die also felt angry towards Di Yalan. She jumped over to her side and suddenly patted on her thigh.Di Yalan was already very embarrassed. She couldn\u2019t help the trembling of her body, but still kept her eyes shut. She thought this was another trick of Shi Yan, and called him a fucking bastard in secret. After all this, how dare he still tease her like this?\u201cSister Lan, how long are you planning to fool us by sleeping? Your face is already as red as an apple. And you still want to pretend that you are operating your Profound Qi? You think we are both too foolish to tell?\u201d Mu Yu Die said in an annoyed voice.Di Yalan let out a soft sigh and opened her eyes reluctantly. She replied with embarrassment, \u201cI\u2026 I just woke up. What\u2026 what are you two talking about? I have no idea.\u201dMu Yu Die went silent all of a sudden. However, the beautiful but sharp eyes of hers were continuously moving between Di Yalan and Shi Yan. Her underlying sentence was obvious: How can you just pretend that nothing had happened between the two of you?Under the judgmental stare from Mu Yu Die, Shi Yan still remained calm and peaceful. You\u2019ve got to say, there aren\u2019t many people as shameless as him in this world. He actually could pretend that nothing had happened between him and the woman.Because he guessed that Di Yalan actually wouldn\u2019t mind this thing very much. She would even like or miss this kind of feeling. Knowing that he wouldn\u2019t receive any trouble from Di Yalan, he didn\u2019t bother to worry at all.However, under Mu Yu Die\u2019s questioning look, Di Yalan wasn\u2019t able to remain that calm. She thought about it and decided that she should express some anger toward Shi Yan. Otherwise, she would really appear to be shameless in the eyes of Mu Yu Die.Despite everything, Shi Yan had helped her experience overwhelming pleasure and excitement, which her man could hardly offer even back when he was still alive.\u201cYou fucking bastard!\u201d Di Yalan suddenly jumped up, screaming with a sharp voice and pointing right at Shi Yan, \u201cHow dare you do that to me back then? How dare you?\u201d\u201cShh! Keep it quiet! You are gonna draw all those demon beasts here. Furthermore, the people from the Dark World are still chasing us!\u201d Shi Yan reminded her.Di Yalan nodded. She had lost her power again, and said in a low voice, \u201cYou asshole, so how are you gonna make it up to me?\u201dSeeing Di Yalan acting like this, he was even more assured about his prior judgment. He knew that she didn\u2019t mind this little episode very much. She only jumped out to accuse him because of the pressure from Mu Yu Die.Shi Yan was actually amused by her reaction. He pretended to be thinking very hard there. He bowed his head down, put on a sad face, pretending to be sincere in his apology, and said in an honest voice, \u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. Sister Lan, how about you tell me, how would you like to be compensated?\u201dDi Yalan was literally surprised by his reply. She froze for a while and thought very hard about his question. She only came to curse him, because she didn\u2019t want to appear shameless in front of Mu Yu Die. She actually hadn\u2019t really thought about how to punish Shi Yan. Caught by surprise by Shi Yan, she literally didn\u2019t know how to respond.\u201cHow about\u2026 how about you beat him up and call it a night?\u201d Mu Yu Die put on a naughty face and joked about it. Even she could tell that her Sister Lan was not intending to punish Shi Yan, at least not very hard.\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea. He surely deserves that!\u201d Di Yalan nodded with agreement, and said with a tough voice, \u201cJust wait until he recovers from his wounds. At that time, I\u2019m gonna kick his ass! You don\u2019t need to worry about this. I will make sure that you will be satisfied with his punishment. \u201dMu Yu Die rolled her eyes at Di Yalan and went completely speechless. What was that all about? What do I have to do with your business? So you are simply punishing him in order to make me satisfied?\u201cWhatever you two. I\u2019m going to sleep.\u201d Mu Yu Die had finally realized that she was literally caring too much. She should have just minded her own business. She mumbled as she turned to sleep, \u201cOne horny man, one slutty woman\u2026 no wonder\u2026 you two were already expecting this to happen\u2026 I should have known better\u2026 Poor me, my soul has been hurt, and my eyes have been polluted\u2026\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe kept a low voice, but due to the small space between the three of them, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise that both Di Yalan and Shi Yan had heard her clearly.Shi Yan secretly grinned and pretended to be sleeping.However, Di Yalan couldn\u2019t take this anymore. She teased Mu Yu Die a little, \u201cYou wicked girl!\u201dMu Yu Die took a glance at her and mumbled again, \u201cYou two, be quiet for the rest of the night. I really need some good sleep. Please, just control yourselves. I cannot take your actions anymore.\u201dDi Yalan replied with a blush on her face, \u201cI know, I know, just go to sleep, you wicked girl!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The two of them just lay there facing each other. Neither of them knew what to say.\u201cIt\u2019s about dawn.\u201d Shi Yan looked up at the sky, trying to make some casual conversation. \u201cHow are you feeling? Has your Profound Qi recovered?\u201d\u201cNot only has my Profound Qi recovered, but it has also been enhanced.\u201dDi Yalan checked her body in secret. Her eyes suddenly lit up in excitement. She said in a low voice, with a blush on her face, \u201cBack then\u2026 back then it seemed like there was some strange energy streaming into my body. That strange energy merged with my own Profound Qi, and even altered something in my chest.\u201dShe frowned a little, trying very hard to recall the feeling. She thought that the strange stream of energy seemed to have come from Shi Yan, or was originated from the Profound Qi that he had shot into her body.Shi Yan thought for a while, and whispered to himself, \u201cIt really is that\u2026\u201dDi Yalan\u2019s gorgeous eyes lit up with an exotic charm again. She insisted, \u201cIs it because of you?\u201dShi Yan nodded, and explained with a smile, \u201cI once received some pills from an Alchemist, but when I took them I never managed to absorb them entirely. However, those pills, as well as their power, still remain inside my body. Back then\u2026 back then it seemed as if the power of those pills merged with my Profound Qi and got planted into your body as well. \u201dThe thing about absorbing Profound Qi from dead people was too creepy and scary to talk about, and Shi Yan didn\u2019t want anybody else to know about his secret. Therefore, he was using Master Karu as an excuse, and claiming all his strange power due to those pills.\u201cThose pills must have been extraordinarily precious.\u201d Di Yalan nodded. She seemed to have bought Shi Yan\u2019s story. Along their travels, Shi Yan had resorted to using poisonous medicine powders several times. Therefore, she had already suspected that Shi Yan had some kind of relation with an Alchemist.\u201cYeah, I guess.\u201d Shi Yan smiled without elaborating too much on his relationship with Master Karu. He thought for a while and said with a frown, \u201cYou mentioned that there was a strange stream of energy which seemed to have changed the muscles and blood vessels within your chest. Can you try to operate your Profound Qi around your chest and see if there are any reactions?\u201dShi Yan suddenly thought of the miraculous awakening of his Petrification Martial Spirit inside his body. It seemed that the strange flow of energy could not only enhance one\u2019s Profound Qi, but also trigger one\u2019s dormant Martial Spirit.It was exactly due to the influence of that strange energy that the dormant Petrification Martial Spirit inside his body had suddenly awakened. Even the emergence of the Immortal Martial Spirit probably had something to do with that strange stream of energy. Hearing Di Yalan talking about the odd changes in her chest, Shi Yan had already come up with a theory.\u201cOK. Let me try.\u201d Di Yalan slowly nodded. She concentrated her energy into her chest and paid close attention to the changes happening inside.Controlling her Profound Qi, streams of Profound Qi flew into her beautiful bosoms, and lingered for a while around her tender breasts. But now, her Profound Qi seemed to be a bit different. Suddenly a most amazing thing happened. It seemed that her Profound Qi had changed and was becoming hotter and hotter.Di Yalan suddenly panicked. She quickly moved the Profound Qi towards her arm, and then through the veins and vessels, into her right palm.\u201cBoom!\u201dA magic flame the color of purest blue suddenly jumped out of Di Yalan\u2019s right palm. Although the flame was merely the size of a fist, it was burning with an extraordinarily high temperature. The little flame was dancing on Di Yalan\u2019s palm, lighting up the hollow tree, as if they were embraced by the tender blue waves of the ocean.\u201cWow!\u201dDi Yalan couldn\u2019t help but exclaim. She jumped with excitement and her eyes were shining brightly.Bingo!Shi Yan was also secretly cheering. He was right about this energy! Looking at that blue flame, he was now certain that that strange energy could really trigger one\u2019s inborn Martial Spirit!\u201cThe Blue Magic Flame!\u201dDi Yalan couldn\u2019t help but scream in excitement. She said with complete thrill, \u201cThis is the Martial Spirit of my family! I know about this! This is the Blue Magic Flames Martial Spirit! Since my grandfather, no one has inherited this Martial Spirit. Oh my God! But how\u2026 how is this even possible?\u201dMu Yu Die was already awake due to the noise they were making. She was also staring at Di Yalan, but couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on. Mu Yu Die looked so confused, \u201cHow is that even possible? Sister Lan, you are already 27 years old. How come that you could still awaken the dormant Martial Spirit inside your body? What is going on here? Is this a dream?\u201d She rubbed her eyes and still couldn\u2019t believe what just happened.\u201cHa!\u201d Di Yalan was brimming with excitement. She had absolutely no idea how to express her bliss. She couldn\u2019t help but continuously stare at that blue burning flame on her palm, and she suddenly burst into tears.She was actually crying in joy.However, Shi Yan could totally understand her feelings.On the Grace Mainland, warriors with Martial Spirits definitely took a dominant position. They would have more prosperous future as well. To warriors, the Martial Spirits were more important than anything else. Those without a Martial Spirit would often dream and kill for a Martial Spirit.To warriors like Di Yalan, whose family had once possessed a Martial Spirit, it was a real shame not to carry on their family\u2019s Martial Spirit as an inheritance.If this situation continued for several generations, even the most glorious family could end up fading into oblivion.No matter if it was the warrior, or their family, possession of a Martial Spirit was essential.\u201cSo what is really going on here?\u201d Mu Yu Die was still confused after staring at Di Yalan for a while, who was totally flying high in excitement, so she had to turn the question to Shi Yan.\u201cUm\u2026\u201d Shi Yan put on an embarrassed smile, \u201cWell, this is hard to explain. It has something to do with the pills and their exotic power. I don\u2019t exactly know what kind of pills they were. Anyway, those pills are indeed a little extraordinary. Quit staring at me like that. I already said I really have no idea.\u201d\u201cYou bastard! Come here! Thank you! Thank you!\u201d Di Yalan put out the blue flame on her palm, and suddenly hugged Shi Yan tightly, as if she were trying to squeeze his whole body into her bosom. Her sexy body couldn\u2019t help but tremble with the excitement.Those delicious bosoms of hers were squeezed against Shi Yan\u2019s chest, which gave Shi Yan the opportunity to experience their glorious softness again. Before long, he had that kind of reaction from below his belt again.But this time, Di Yalan found out about his little thrill down there almost immediately. She quickly released Shi Yan from her arms with a blush on her face. Her eyes were especially charming, shining with light and dancing colors. She couldn\u2019t help but laugh and said with a smile, \u201cYou ass, always so horny!\u201d\u201cHey\u2026\u201d Shi Yan also laughed in embarrassment. He didn\u2019t give a reply though.Mu Yu Die stared at the two people and she was obviously not so happy, \u201cHey! You two, knock it off! I am still here! Don\u2019t put on a sex show in front of me every time you get a chance!\u201d\u201cYou wicked girl! I\u2019m just too excited!\u201d Di Yalan replied with a laugh.\u201cWhat is going on after all?\u201d The question was killing Mu Yu Die.\u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d Di Yalan shook her head, her eyes still lit up with those flying colors. She laughed, \u201cI guess it\u2019s all because of him.\u201d\u201cYou mean\u2026 you had sex with this guy, and then all of a sudden, your Martial Spirit that had been dormant inside of your body for 27 years, which probably would never be awakened in your life, was suddenly brought to life?\u201d Mu Yu Die said with a curious look on her pretty face.\u201cIncredible as it sounds, that is the truth.\u201d Di Yalan admitted with a red face.\u201cSo\u2026 so the essence of his, what is it? Some magic medicine with a strange power?\u201d Mu Yu Die also started to blush. She shook her head as she couldn\u2019t believe this at all, \u201cNo, no! I don\u2019t believe this! This doesn\u2019t make sense at all!\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d Shi Yan looked up at the sky from the hollow tree, and said, \u201cThe sun is out. We should get going.\u201d\u201cYeah, we should probably keep moving.\u201d Di Yalan agreed. Apparently, she didn\u2019t want to spend too much time discussing this issue about herself, in case Mu Yu Die would say something again to embarrass her.After saying that, Di Yalan quickly flew up to the top of the hollow tree. She threw a rope down to the two of them and asked Mu Yu Die to come out quickly.\u201cNo, I am still not buying it!\u201d Mu Yu Die was obviously still obsessed with the issue, and only grabbed that rope after some sighing and groaning.With Di Yalan\u2019s help, Mu Yu Die slowly rose up with help from the rope, and slowly rose to the top of the hollow tree.\u201cAh! You asshole! What are you doing?\u201d Mu Yu Die suddenly started screaming. The two delicate legs of hers were kicking desperately, and her mesmerising body was swinging in the air.\u201cLet me help you with this.\u201d Shi Yan put both his hands on Mu Yu Die\u2019s soft bottom and tried to lift her up. He said with a horny smile, \u201cThere you go. This will save you some effort.\u201d\u201cNo! Stop it! I don\u2019t want your help!\u201d Mu Yu Die shouted with her body twisting intensely. Her hands suddenly lost their grip and she fell from mid-air.\u201cThump!\u201dThe two of them fell onto the ground inside the hollow tree.Shi Yan was lying there with a satisfactory look on his face. Mu Yu Die was sitting right across his waist with her legs kicking and shouting, \u201cStop! Stop!\u201dThe soft and smooth bottom of hers was right where Shi Yan liked it most, pressing tightly against his sensitive parts.Shi Yan\u2019s dick was still hard due to the previous entanglement with Di Yalan. Now, with the pressing and twisting of Mu Yu Die\u2019s hips, and her delicious parts continuously touching and rubbing his sensitive parts, Shi Yan was turned on again, and he almost couldn\u2019t help but moan in great pleasure.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAh! Asshole! You horny dog!\u201dIt didn\u2019t take Mu Yu Die much time to discover Shi Yan\u2019s intentions. She quickly got up with her hands covering her butt, screaming and crying. Her face was so pretty with that blush, and her beautiful eyes were filled with little tears. \u201cSister Lan, this bad guy! He was trying to take advantage of me!\u201d\u201cShh!\u201d Di Yalan looked pretty serious. She made a sign to tell them to stay quiet.Shi Yan quickly stood up. He suddenly forgot all about the sexy scenes that had previously happened in this hollow tree. He climbed up the tree quickly and stayed with Di Yalan. He said with a calm and cool voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201d\u201cDemon beasts!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tata!\u201dHeavy running steps sounded across the silent night. Judging from the sound of those steps, one could tell that it must have been human beings running in the woods.However, Shi Yan couldn\u2019t tell if it was a warrior chasing the demon beast, or a demon beast hunting a human. He didn\u2019t want to be involved, and thus said to Di Yalan, \u201cHide well. Let\u2019s not ask for trouble. Remember the lesson from the Tush Mercenary Union.\u201dDi Yalan nodded, and mumbled to Mu Yu Die on the hollow tree, \u201cDon\u2019t make a sound. Stay inside the tree leaves.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go and hide inside another dense tree.\u201d After a little thought, Shi Yan moved swiftly, found another luxuriant ancient tree and crouched in the leaves immediately.As soon as he did that, Di Yalan came up and hid herself with him.They were still on alert as they hid themselves in the dense leaves. Meanwhile they also removed their scent from the surroundings, to completely hide their presence.Before long, five flustered mercenaries appeared at a distance with terrified looks on their faces.They were all heavily wounded. Amongst them, the leader was a Human Level warrior, and the rest were at the Nascent Level.The mercenaries were running through the woods with flustered expressions, looking over their shoulders, as if they were getting chased by demon beasts.And that was exactly what was happening.Just as they appeared in Shi Yan\u2019s sight, he beheld a Fire Snake and two Ice Lizards moving in the woods quickly. At the same time, several Silver Armoured Scorpions, which were nearly a foot big, came up from the left, seeming to encircle them.The five mercenaries were completely terrified as they rushed into the woods.Shi Yan turned pale as he realised that those mercenaries were done for.Shi Yan could clearly see a robust Silver Wolf in the direction they were heading to. The wolf was four metres long but they didn\u2019t see it!The wolf had two silver five-meter-long wings, which looked novel and mysterious, adorned with delicate patterns.Though it was the first time that Shi Yan had seen it, he had heard its story long ago. That was a Silver Thunder Wolf of Level Seven\u2014- atop demon beast in the Dark Forest!Then he was sure that it wouldn\u2019t be a warriors-kill-demon beasts scenario, but\u2026 the complete opposite one.The bloody hunting started at once!The moment the five warriors rushed into the woods and saw the awaiting Silver Thunder Wolf, they screamed with despair.The Silver Thunder Wolf didn\u2019t even give them a chance to struggle. It spread its thunder wings in no time and devastating blasts came out one after another beside the warriors. Three of them cut into shreds in an instant!The Silver Thunder Wolf stood there in arrogance\u2014-it didn\u2019t strike again.Those chasing demon beasts ran up quickly and encircled the rest two in no time.The Fire Snake and Ice Lizards worked together to attack the warriors. Soon, one of them was poisoned by the Silver Armour Scorpion, and the other killed by an Ice Lizard.\u201cCreak!\u201d\u201dCreak!\u201dHorrifying sounds broke the serenity of the deep forest.Apart from the Silver Thunder Wolf, the other demon beasts crowded around the five dead bodies and started feasting on their bones.Di Yalan was too terrified to look in that direction.She was not at all afraid of killing, but those demon beasts were eating human flesh, which would make her vomit badly if she saw\u2026Hiding in the leaves, Shi Yan was gazing at those demon beasts calmly, while figuring out something in his mind.As the five warriors were dead, their Profound Qi was gradually seeping out, and as it would eventually melt in the air and disappear.If he could get to that area before the Profound Qi disappeared, he would benefit by a lot!However, there were so many demon beasts feasting on the bodies, he could do nothing but hope they would leave soon.\u201cOooouch\u2026\u201dA miserable human cry came from very far away, which was full of fear and despair.The still Silver Thunder Wolf suddenly howled and dashed out.Hearing its howl, those demon beasts, who had almost eaten up the five bodies, stopped eating at once and followed the wolf in a hurry. They seemed to hunt other human beings.Immediately, Shi Yan jumped down the dense tree as soon as they left, and headed to those messed up bodies like a ghost.Di Yalan was startled as she screamed from the tree in a low voice, \u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cGoing and checking what had happened. I will be back soon. Don\u2019t leave the tree.\u201d Shi Yan didn\u2019t even bother to look back and moved to those bodies speedily. As he arrived near to the bodies, he closed his eyes and began to feel them.Luckily enough, it wasn\u2019t too late for him. The warrior of Human Level had more Profound Qi than others, and there was still twenty percent of it left on his body.The invisible Profound Qi went into his pores, as being attracted by a magnet, and then flew into his meridians\u2026Sensing the power of the foreign Profound Qi, Shi Yan smiled with satisfaction.Before long, all the Profound Qi which had not melted and disappeared into the air yet, went into Shi Yan\u2019s body.At the sight of the limbs and entrails on the ground, Shi Yan frowned. Nonetheless, enduring the bad smell, he began to examine their carry bags.There was too much blood on the food, and it might also be the poison from the Silver Armour Scorpion\u2014-it\u2019s inedible now. Crystal coins were not of much use in this area, and too many of it would prevent them from moving fast, thus the warriors didn\u2019t carry too many crystal coins.Searching for a while, Shi Yan was able to pillage only few demon beast material and medicine..Poor guys!Shi Yan mumbled as he cleaned his hands with one bag. Then he walked towards where Di Yalan was hiding.\u201cHoooooowl!\u201d \u201cHoooowl!\u201dDemon beasts were howling in the Dark Forest even at dawn. They seemed to be running around and hunting for warriors and mercenaries in a group.Hearing the horrifying sound, Shi Yan wasn\u2019t frightened. On the contrary, he was a little happy.Demon beasts\u2019 actions would influence their chasers. They would be spotted by demon beasts if they were still moving in the forest at night, and the more they moved, the more likely they would be found by the demon beasts. Maybe the people from the Dark World, Mo Family and the Tush Mercenary Union would lose a lot tonight, and the demon beasts would have a full belly tonight.He was right\u2026That night, Mo Chaoge and his people were taken care of by the demon beasts.As they wanted Shi Yan and Mu Yu Die desperately, the troop didn\u2019t sleep at night after Hu Long committed suicide. Instead, they kept searching for Shi Yan and his friends in the Dark Forest. Therefore, they were noticed by demon beasts. Thanks to the five warriors, the troops finally got to know of the reality and hid themselves in ancient trees.\u201cWhat were you doing?\u201d Di Yalan frowned, \u201cWere their possessions really worth the risk? If the demon beasts returned or if you were noticed by them, you would have had no way to escape!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cLook, didn\u2019t I return safely?\u201dShi Yan climbed up the tree without explaining what he had gained.

Or they wouldn\u2019t act like this!\u201d\u201cWhat should we do?\u201d Di Yalan had no idea, \u201cAre we still going to head forward?\u201d\u201cWait for a while.

Did some demon beasts pass by?\u201dShi Yan sat down and began to feel the Profound Qi which had filled his meridians, without replying to Mu Yu Die.Most of the Profound Qi, on those five warriors, had vanished into the air, and Shi Yan was able to absorb only a small part of it.But since there was a Human-Level warrior among them, even if he just got a small part, it was a lot.However, Shi Yan was still a little worried. He was cautious, for he didn\u2019t know when the negative emotions would break out.Seeing Shi Yan keep silence, Di Yalan told Mu Yu Die what had just happened outside.Hearing the story, Mu Yu Die\u2019s face turned serious and she seemed to be more worried. They were chased by so many bad guys, and now there were demon beasts in their way, she found their future was getting more and more hopeless.The sun rose slowly and began to light up the sky. After one night\u2019s rest, the three started to discuss in the hollow tree.Shi Yan didn\u2019t got too many chances to communicate with the girls when Luo Hao and his people were with them, so he didn\u2019t know much about them. But now those males, including Luo Hao, had been killed, so he guessed he should know more about them, or he would land himself in a passive position.\u201cWhy is the Dark World chasing you?\u201d Shi Yan asked in a steady voice while frowning, \u201cYou are from the Fire Empire?\u201dMu Yu Die nodded and sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s all because of me\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Shi Yan knew Mu Yu Die was a very special person. Now that she was to explain, he wanted the whole story.\u201cSister Lan, you tell him.\u201d Mu Yu Die glanced at Di Yalan and sighed again.\u201cYou don\u2019t know who Die is?\u201d Di Yalan was surprised as she looked at Shi Yan with curious eyes, \u201cThough you are from the Merchant Union, you must have heard of General Muku from the Fire Empire?!\u201d\u201cMuku? The General of the Eagle Army of the Fire Empire? The Iron Eagle King?\u201dShi Yan was so astonished that he nodded after a long thought, \u201cSo she is the granddaughter of The Iron Eagle King ? I got it.\u201dShi Yan went through the fragmental memories about the Iron Eagle King \u2013 King Muku, and . got the complete story after recalling it.In the memories of the other Shi Yan, Muku was the General of the Eagle Army of the Fire Empire, who was a Nirvana-Level warrior and held the real power of the Fire Empire!The Iron Eagle King was not only famous in the Fire Empire, but also well known in the Merchant Union and the God-blessed Empire.Muku was a legendary military leader who was seen in every battle between the Fire Empire and the God-blessed Empire. He was famous for his cruelty on the battlefield, and uncountable people had perished in his hands!Muku was merciless to his foes, and was also obstinate to his own people, thus offending many powerful people.Three years ago, in a battle between the Fire Empire and the God-blessed Empire, Muku was killed by five Nirvana-Level warriors.For Muku had offended a lot of people when he was alive, his family got into trouble as soon as he died. Just in a few days, many of his direct relatives were slaughtered, thus the big family sank at once.\u201cI have heard of the Iron Eagle King.\u201d After thinking for a while, Shi Yan nodded.\u201cDie is the Eagle King\u2019s granddaughter, the only survivor of her family. The Dark World is an organization of assassins in the Empire, and it was the one who slaughtered her family. Die could survive only because of her Martial Spirit. On that day, her zither killed a lot of people in an invisible way, for her Martial Spirit has something to do with music\u2026\u201d\u201cYou mean, Miss Mu\u2019s Martial Spirit could kill with her zither?\u201d\u201cYes. Die\u2019s zither can not only prevent onefrom becoming mad, but also can shatter one\u2019s organs. The Dark World wants Die because their lord trains in a vicious Martial Skill and loses his mind now and then. He wants to calm himself with the help of Die\u2019s music.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201d Shi Yan nodded.\u201cAs the Dark World was involved in the slaughter of her family, Die would rather die than help them. How could she help their lord train his vicious Martial Skill!\u201dBut the Dark World was too powerful in the Fire Empire, so she had to seek for shelter in foreign countries.Knowing Mu Yu Die\u2019s identity and story, Shi Yan asked again, \u201cThen why can\u2019t Miss Mu operate her Martial Spirit now?\u201d\u201cHer Martial Spirit is quite special. Everytime she operates her Martial Spirit and kills people, several of her veins break like the zither strings. Before the veins reconnect, the Profound Qi can\u2019t move fluently. She would get injured heavily if she operated the Profound Qi, and it would take more time for the Martial Spirit to recover.\u201dDi Yalan looked gloomy, \u201cTwo months ago, just as we were about to enter the Dark Forest at the border of the Fire Empire, the Dark World found us and we lost several people. Since Uncle Luo couldn\u2019t prevent them anymore, Die operated her Profound Qi. Though she killed a lot, her own veins broke too. And they have not recovered yet.\u201d\u201cSo you need your veins to help operate the Profound Qi?\u201d Shi Yan was quite confused, \u201cAre you playing your zither, or playing your veins?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t explain either.\u201d Mu Yu Die replied lazily. She looked dim.\u201cDamage to the Martial Spirit\u2026\u201d Shi Yan deliberated over it for a moment, then he uttered, \u201cMaybe I could help.\u201dMu Yu Die and Di Yalan\u2019s eyes lit at once, they stared at Shi Yan together!\u201cWell\u2026\u201d Shi Yan just popped up with that thought and he got embarrassed, \u201cWell, sister Lan, your Martial Spirit had come to life? The medicine in my body may be helpful for her too. I think\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you ever think about that!\u201dMu Yu Die replied with anger and she stared at him, \u201cStop your dirty idea about me!\u201dShe knew too well how Di Yalan regained her Martial Spirit\u2026How would she sell her virginity for it?!\u201cI was joking. Don\u2019t take it seriously.\u201d Shi Yan looked indifferent, and he looked up at the entrance of the hollow tree, \u201cIt\u2019s about noon, and I don\u2019thear demon beasts, let\u2019s resume our journey.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Di Yalan giggled.\u2026They got out from the tree hole and advanced in the forest, while Di Yalan still carried Mu Yu Die on her back.After a whole night\u2019s hunting, the demon beasts all seemed to be resting. They didn\u2019t see a single high-level demon beast on the way. Yet, those human remains reminded them how nasty the demon beasts were last night.At dusk.The Profound Qi in Shi yan\u2019s body was purified, and thus the negative power filled Shi Yan\u2019s mind again. He got a strong urge to kill.He knew Mu Yu Die\u2019s zither could comfort him and diminish the negative emotions, but it would attract those demon beasts and their chasers in the serenity of the forest.Since he had the experience with Di Yalan, Shi Yan hesitated for a second, wandered his lustful eyes on Di Yalan\u2019s delicious body for a while as he developed a plan.\u2026Night came.In a secret valley, Mu Yu Die cuddled in the branches of a dense ancient tree. She was gazing at the bushes ten meters away with a blushed face, while grinding her teeth.The bushes were shaking continuously, combined with waves of suppressed moans\u2026\u201cWhores!\u201d Biting her lips, Mu Yu Die cursed.After a long yell, that bush calmed down.Minutes later, Shi Yan and Di Yalan stood up from it and walked back with messy clothes.Shi yan walked in steady steps and looked calm, as if nothing had happened.While Di Yalan looked fresh in her skin and smiled with satisfied eyes, though she had some grass in her long hair.\u201cMiss Mu, why didn\u2019t you go to sleep?\u201d As he got close, Shi Yan saw Mu Yu Die was watching him in despise, so he asked casually with a careless smile.\u201cHumph!\u201d Mu Yu Die was angry as she cursed, \u201cShameless!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Shi Yan returned her a smile, and said casually, \u201cMaybe we can\u2019t even see the sun tomorrow, who would care about this? Do whatever you want.\u201d\u201cYeah, we could be three dead bodies at this time of tomorrow. I don\u2019t care.\u201d Di Yalan walked up and showed just a slight of shame.Hearing their excuse, Mu Yu Die was stunned. As she realized their situation, she didn\u2019t know what to say at all.\u201cSister Lan, train by heart. Maybe you can improve a lot.\u201d Shi Yan smiled meaningfully.\u201cOk, I understand.\u201d Di Yalan got his undertone and laughed, \u201cYou are really something, aren\u2019t you! Haha!\u201dThus, Di Yalan climbed up the ancient tree and sat down on a strong branch. Under Mu Yu Die\u2019s confused eyes, she started to train wholeheartedly.Shi Yan didn\u2019t climb up the tree. Instead, he sat down beside the tree cross-legged.Due to the intercourse with Di Yalan, those negative emotions in his meridians were cleansed. And the miraculous power from the meridians gushed into his body and nourished his Martial Spirit.Only a small part of it went into Di Yalan\u2019s body,but this benefited Di Yalan too.Closing his eyes, Shi Yan could feel that power was changinghis blood and flesh. He operated his Profound Qi in the Big Circulation.One hour later, Shi Yan found that that miraculous power had all gone into his body, thus he began to practise his Petrification Martial Spirit.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAs he thought about it, his bare arms hardened, and gradually they turned into dark brown.Dark brown?Shi Yan opened his eyes abruptly, which were as bright as stars. He looked in wonder and carefully examined his arms.Dark brown! It was exactly Dark brown!Shi Yan was so excited that he wanted to laugh wildly. At that moment, he finally realized how that power benefited his Martial Spirit magically.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34 Mysterious Martial SpiritHe realized in surprise that the power could not only operate the Profound Qi, but also increase it by levels!The Martial Spirit only increases with the advancement in martial levels. It will be enhanced only with the progresion to higher level.This was to say, one would have a breakthrough in his Martial Spirit only when he enhanced from Elementary Level to Nascent Level, or from Nascent Level to Human Level, and so on.The small progress from the First Sky of Nascent Level to the Second Sky wouldn\u2019t change the Martial Spirit a bit.Only the progress across levels could develop the Martial Spirit!However there were exceptions!The Martial Spirit didn\u2019t increase with every advancement of a level. Sometimes, it only increased when the warrior progressed by two or three levels!For example, the progress of Shi Yan\u2019s Petrification Martial Spirit consisted of four stages.A descendant of Shi Family who herited Petrification Martial Spirit, would show grey skin about ten days after his birth, which meant the First Stage.If this guy was diligent in training Martial Arts and reached the Human Level, the Petrification Martial Spirit would develop and his skin would turn dark brown, which was the Second Stage.Once he got to the Earth Level, the skin would grow green with the advnacement in Martial Skill, which meant the Third Stage.If he was genius enough to get to the Sky Level, the Martial Skill would reach the pinnacle and the skin would turn purple, which would be the Fourth Stage!The Petrification Martial Spirit of the Shi Family strengthened only with every two levels and then changed one\u2019s skin color.Everytime the Petrification Martial Spirit changed and progressed to a higher state, one\u2019s muscles\u2019 defensive power would increase by several times!When the Petrification Martial Spiritl was at First Stage, one could easily defend against human fists and attacks infused with Profound Qi to a level.When it reached the Second Stage and the skin turned dark brown, thedefensive power would increase by many times, and one could not only defend against the strong attacks from Profound Qi, but could also safegaurd attacks from average weapons.The green skin of Stage Three had a much stronger defensive power! Weapons could hardly penetrate one\u2019s body, and at the same time, one\u2019sbody would still unbelievably be agile and flexible!As it reached Stage Four, the body would turn purple and wouldn\u2019t be injured by anything, not even by water, fire, or anymysterious tricks. The body would become emormously powerful and agile.Initally, if the descendant of Shi Family was at Elementary or Nascent Level, his Petrification Martial Spirit would stay at Stage One. It wouldn\u2019t advance until he broke to Human Level. The stage of this Martial Spirit advanced only with the increase of one\u2019s level.Other Martial Spirits on the Grace Mainland were all the same as Petrification: they increase along with the advancing of one\u2019s level. But some magical pills could change the rules, and help the Martial Spirit increase cross levels.On the Grace Mainland, these magical pills existed only in legends. Warriors of The Fire Empire, the God-blessed Empire and the Merchant Union had merely heard of these. The real pills hadn\u2019t been beheld by anybody.Even the three Medicine Kings of the Medicine Valley in the Fire Empire were only Soul-Level alchemists, far from the Divinity Level alchemists who wereable to refine suchmagical pills.However, that power from his meridians seemed to have broken the rules!That magical power could not only awaken the Martial Spirit, but also increase the Martial Spirit through stages!His arms had turned dark brown after petrification, which would happen only to a warrior of Human Level from the Shi Family.This was apparently the Second Stage of Petrification!The magical power could awakenhis Martial Spirit, and can also increase it, what did this mean?It meant that he might enter Stage Four of Petrification Martial Spirit even if he hadn\u2019t advanced to the Sky Level!Being impervious to either weapon or water, the body would not turn stiff, but become more agile, being able to defend against all kinds of attacks.At the thought of power of Stage Four of Petrification, Shi Yan was pleased that he had gained something precious.This ability was obviously aMartial Spirit too, which not only helped him purify the Profound Qi in his meridians, but also mysteriously imposed negative emotions on his foes during fights.This mysterious Martial Spirit was able to absorbProfound Qi from the dead, alter it into alive magical power in meridians, and awaken and increase other Martial Spirits\u2026Shi Yan\u2019s dark eyes were sparkling like stars.Sitting there silently, he realized that if he trained hard with the help of this amazing Martial Spirit, he would be a terrible existence on the Grace Mainland!\u2026The Dark Forest. In a bloody area, where there were dead bodies all around the ground, a troop of people who looked gloomy were examining something.\u201cThey were from the Wolf Mercenary Union.\u201d Bernard walked among those dead bodies, looking worried, \u201cThe Captain of the Wolf Mercenary Union was a Disaster-Level warrior\u2014-the same as me. It looks like they were obliterated completely.\u201dOn hearing that, the Crescent Emissary and Mo Chaoge frowned at the same time.After a moment\u2019s hesitation, the Crescent Emissary took out a silver horn and began to blow it.Instead of any sound, an odd wave was sent out and propagated away.Before long, two men, who wore silver gowns and masks, showed up secretly from the woods. Their masks were green and tush-like, which were different from the pale masks on the Crescent Emissary and his people.\u201cEmissary, have you found anything?\u201d The Crescent Emissary asked coldly.\u201cMany warriors and mercenaries were attacked last night by demon beasts. Too many foot prints here. We can\u2019t tell which are our targets\u2019.\u201d one Star Emissary answered respectfully.The Dark World had two divisions\u2014-Dark Emissaries and Black Emissaries. The former were responsible for tracing and collecting information, and the latter killing. They were graded as the Star, the Moon and the Sun.Though the Dark Emissaries and the Black Emissaries did completely different work, they were strictly graded. The star emissaries of Star Level were under Crescent Emissaries of Moon Level.\u201cIs it so hard to find the target?\u201d the Crescent Emissary was good at kiling and fighting, but was bad at tracing. Hearing that, his eyes turned dim.\u201cSir, it\u2019s a large area and there are too many warriors, demon beasts and mercenaries, so it\u2019s really hard to find the targets. During these days\u2019 searching, we were attacked by numerous mercenaries, and one of us was killed.\u201dThe Dark World had disrepute, so the bold warriors and mercenaries who came to this area might kill people from the Dark World if they were in a bad mood.In the past couple of days, they had encountered these kinds of cases for some time. They were even challenged after the cooperated with warriors from Mo Family, though they didn\u2019t lose much.\u201cCan\u2019t find the targets, and unsettled demon beasts, too tough\u2026\u201dAfter pondering on it, Mo Chaoge said, \u201cWe should stop this aimless search. What about waiting in the Silent Town? It is the only way toward the Merchant Union. They would definitely go to the Silent Town once they get out of the Dark Forest, thus we could wait for them there.\u201d\u201cGood idea.\u201d Bernard nodded and showed a murderous look, \u201cwhoerver goes to the Merchant Union would pass the Silent Town, so we just need to wait and meet them there.\u201d\u201cWell then, let cross this region as soon as possible. And wait for their appearance during our way to the Silent Town.\u201d The Crescent Emissary kept mute for a long time, and compromised to this suggestion, for he couldn\u2019t come up with a better one.The three came to an agreement quickly and stopped searching for Shi Yan and his friends. The y began to prepare to cross the Dark Forest and ambush on its boarder and the way to the Silent Town.\u2026For five days, they were moving in the Dark Forest carefully, hiding from demon beasts and warriors.At night, they would stop moving and rest in covert region.In this way, they avoided many high-level demon beasts, mercenaries and warriors with great luck.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAnd every night, Shi Yan would train ceaselessly to adapt the Second Stage of Petrification and let the shift go to every cell of his body.Di Yalan had kept away from men for years. And since she had those amazing experiences with Shi Yan, she would always asked him for it. They let off their passions under trees, in bushes and beside brooks.Mu Yu Die knew she was not able to stop them, so she just let it go, though sometimes she still couldn\u2019t help cursing and complaining about them being shameless.This night, after a short training, Di Yalan jumped up and shouted mirthfully, \u201cI, I just had a breakthrough!\u201d Not long before that, she was having a crazy time with Shi Yan under a big tree\u2026In another ancient tree not far from Di Yalan, Mu Yu Die stuck her head out with surprise. Seeing Di Yalan in messy clothes, she shouted, \u201cThat, that is working?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He looked at Di Yalan, who was still in an absolute bliss, and said with a smile, \u201cCongratulations! Sister Lan!\u201dAfter figuring out what the mysterious Martial Spirit was truly capable of, Shi Yan was just as excited as well. Although Di Yalan was just shagging him for a couple of days, she had already benefited enormously and reached the Human Level. This was almost a miracle, which proved that this mysterious Martial Spirit indeed had limitless power.\u201cThank you so much!\u201dThere was a warmth of gratitude shining through Di Yalan\u2019s gorgeous eyes.She didn\u2019t need to be a genius to realize that what happened to her was due to Shi Yan. For the past few days, she really saw enormous improvements.\u201cWell, this might have something to do with the medicine within my body. Anyway, Sister Lan, you\u2019ve also earned all this by yourself.\u201d Shi Yan replied with a cool face, \u201cSo, now that you have reached the Human Level, could you show us the power of your Martial Spirit \u2013 Blue Magic Flame? Could there be any difference with before?\u201dDi Yalan smiled like a blooming flower. She slowly raised her left hand, with a blue flame suddenly bursting on her palm.The flame was the size of a watermelon, which gradually covered her entire hand .The blue flame was like a living creature. It suddenly turned into dozens of fire snakes, moving around her beautiful arm.Moreover, this magic blue flame could change into various shapes with Di Yalan\u2019s thoughts. It would suddenly turn into snakes, and then into birds, just like actual living creatures, which would almost fly away from her palm at any time.\u201cThe moment I reached the Human Level, I could distinctly sense that my Blue Magic Flames had changed. My Martial Spirit is stronger than ever.\u201d Di Yalan couldn\u2019t hide her excitement, \u201cNot only it has become bigger in size, from the size of a fist to the size of a man\u2019s head, but it also has achieved the capability of matter condensation, which means that it has already reached the second stage.\u201dHer Martial Spirit was capable of matter condensation?Shi Yan nodded. He instantly realized that Di Yalan\u2019s Martial Spirit \u2013 Blue Magic Flame was also quite something. He complimented, \u201cWell, congratulations again!\u201d\u201cThis is all because of you!\u201d Di Yalan said with a shine in her charming eyes. She couldn\u2019t hide her sexual desire in her smile.\u201cHow\u2026 how is this even possible?\u201dMu Yu Die, who was resting on the tree, was filled with doubt and suspicion. \u201cIt only took Sister Lan a couple of days to reach the Human Level. That\u2019s way too fast! How is this even possible? Sister Lan, I clearly remember that you only reached the Third Sky of a Nascent Warrior six months ago. \u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true.\u201d Di Yalan was on top of the world, and said proudly, \u201cI did just enter the Third Sky of a Nascent Warrior six months ago. Even I didn\u2019t expect that I could reach the Human Level so soon. I thought it would at least take me another 3 to 5 years of hard practice before I could ever reach the Human Level. Hehe!\u201dMu Yu Die had no idea how to answer her bragging, so she simply rolled her eyes.How come\u2026 this guy\u2019s essence\u2026 does it really have that kind of magical power?With her mind lingering on that thought, Mu Yu Die couldn\u2019t help but blush again. She forced herself to stop right there and almost called herself a slut.\u2026Another five days had passed by.The three of them continued to proceed in the Dark Forest with great caution.In those five days, each night, they would always hear chaos from the Dark Forest, mixed with the roaring of demon beasts and the crying and screaming of human warriors, as well as mercenaries. This continuous noise and chaos would make even the bravest man be filled with horror.Shi Yan instantly realized that there must be some human who had irritated the higher level demon beasts. That\u2019s why during those nights, he would find a peaceful and an absolutely safe area to rest, and never took any chance to go out at night.During this period, he decided not to confront with any demon beasts, or to pick fights with any mercenaries, i.e., avoiding any trouble from both sides.Because of this code of caution that they took, during those five days, although the three of them didn\u2019t cover a long distance, they didn\u2019t run into any trouble on their way either.Apart from that, if Shi Yan got lucky, he would still find some dead warriors freshly killed by those demon beasts. As soon as those demon beasts left, Shi Yan would rush to those corpsesto collect their lingering Profound Qi.But for the sake of safety, he would always wait for a while after those demon beasts had left, before showing up around those corpses.Although he didn\u2019t harvest much Profound Qi from each corpse, with the stolen Profound Qi accumulating within his body, Shi Yan also managed to enhance his own Petrification Martial Spirit by a bit.Until now, his body was already able to petrify entirely within seconds, just with a thought. All of his skin would change to dark brown, and his defense power was also slowly enhancing.For the past few days, there was never a second when he ever forgot about the practice for controlling his own madness.However, the last threshold was just too difficult for him to break through. Every time he tried to operate the negative energy within his meridians in his brain, he would suffer from a mind-splitting pain. And when he reversed his Profound Qi within his body, he would be under so much pain that he would faint instantly.After a few days of practice, he still could not manage himself through the last stage of Rampage.And after such a series of fainting, Shi Yan guessed that he was probably using the wrong approach. Therefore, he gave up on this tough approach and figured that he should try another way, after a few days\u2019 reflection.\u2026It was night again.The three of them were hiding in a dark cave within a valley. With the opening of the cave covered with bushes, they talked in a low voice.They could hear troops of demon beasts passing by their cave on the outside. It seemed there were the roaring and howling of demon beasts everywhere. God knows how many demon beasts were out there on that night.\u201cIt is a little unusual tonight. It seems that all the demon beasts in the dark forest have come out.\u201d Di Yalan said with a frown on her face, \u201cThis is too strange. Usually, even if the warriors and mercenaries are too out of line, those demon beasts would at most attack them for 2 or 3 days. There is no reason for all these demon beasts to come out. God knows what the hell is going on out there. \u201d\u201cBehind such large scale attacks and movements of these demon beasts, there must be orders from a demon beast of a much higher level.\u201d Shi Yan said with a serious face, \u201cThe Silver Thunder Wolf is already a Level-7 demon beast, equaling our warrior of the Sky Level. It not only has Demon Crystals within its body, but also possesses the intelligence of the same level as humans. As even the Silver Thunder Wolf has showed up to lead, there must be a huge fight behind.\u201d\u201cThank God we proceeded with great caution these days, not aiming to cover more distance, but making safety our first priority. Otherwise, we would have been in loads of trouble.\u201d Di Yalan nodded.\u201cTata! Tata!\u201dThere were some messy footsteps from the outside of the cave. They assumed that this was the movement of human warriors out there.With such frequent movement of the demon beasts out there, those human warriors who were still moving around must be in some serious trouble, probably also being chased and hunted by those demon beasts right now.\u201cMaybe we should go out and take a look? Maybe we could offer some help?\u201d Mu Yu Die asked the other two people dimly.Shi Yan and Di Yalan both took a glimpse at Mu Yu Die, but didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cWhat? You wanna let them die just like that?\u201d Mu Yu Die frowned. She was obviously quite upset.\u201cThere are so many demon beasts out there. We can barely hide ourselves right now. If this cave also got compromised, I am afraid we wouldn\u2019t have much luck with those demon beasts. Apart from that, how can you be so sure that the warriors outside are not a disaster to us? What if they also lust for your beauty? God knows how much trouble that could bring us. I suggest you mind your own business.\u201d Shi Yan sniffed with no mercy at all.Mu Yu Die was not that na\u00efve. Of course she knew all about these. She only said this because she couldn\u2019t bear the idea that humans were killed by those cruel beasts.But after being taught a lesson by Shi Yan like that, her pride was badly hurt. She puckered her lips and mumbled, \u201cCold blooded! You are not even a human! Hum, I guess you are just too scared of dying. I misjudged you before\u2026\u201d\u201cAccording to your suggestion, you are not only not scared to die, you are literally begging to be killed!\u201dShi Yan sneered with a grin, \u201cMiss Mu. You did save my life twice, but I have already repaid your favor. Just so you know, the only reason I am still here, is not because of you, but because of what your Uncle Luo has entrusted me with before he died.\u201dShi Yan paused a little and continued, \u201cYou are not my princess, so don\u2019t pull your drama on me, this annoys me a lot! If I really got pissed one day, I will just leave you here. Whatever you\u2019d like to do is none of my business.\u201d\u201cYou asshole!\u201d Mu Yu Die felt so wronged that her eyes were starting to wet. She tried her best to control her tears and said with a crying voice, \u201cYou know nothing better than lecturing me!\u201d\u201cOK, give it a break you two! At this time, we should be united. We are all heading towards the Merchant Union, so we\u2019d better stick together and look after each other. Stop fighting over such trivial stuff.\u201d Di Yalan intermediated in their conversation.\u201cOh crap!\u201dShi Yan suddenly stood up, and his face looked like hell. \u201cIt seems those people have discovered this cave. They are heading towards this way.\u201d\u201cShit! No way!\u201d Di Yalan was also astonished. She quickly picked up her dagger and guarded the entrance of the cave together with Shi Yan, \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d\u201cOw!\u201d \u201cWoo!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe roaring and howling of the demon beasts could be heard outside the cave. It seemed that there were more and more demon beasts coming toward their way.\u201cBlock the entrance!\u201dShi Yan suddenly changed the look on his face. He put his hands against the rock on the entrance of the cave and shouted, \u201cCome here and pin these rocks. We cannot let anyone into this cave! As soon as other humans get into this cave, those demon beasts would figure out quickly that we\u2019re here. If those demon beasts stick around, then sooner or later they would discover us and that would be a complete disaster! I am not going down with those guys out there!\u201dAfter Shi Yan entered this cave, he not only had covered the entrance with bushes and leaves, but had also moved some big rocks to block the opening, just in case for this type of situation to happen. He didn\u2019t expect that these rocks would actually be put to use.\u201cOK!\u201d Di Yalan was a little shocked, but she also quickly joined Shi Yan in pinning the big rocks, thus blocking the entrance of the cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He and Di Yalan were both shocked and felt numb in their arms.\u201cHey friends inside the cave, take your hands off! Or I won\u2019t be this polite anymore!\u201dAt the entrance of the cave, a cold voice yelled, \u201cMy Matial Spirit can perceive life signs within two hundred meters. I know there are three of you. We just want to get in and hide for a while. Please do us a favor!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s OUR cave! Please go and find one of your own. Don\u2019t get us into trouble.\u201dShi Yan looked very serious as he pressed all his Profound Qi into his arms. In no time, his arms beganto contract and turn dry, while white fog flew around them.\u201cMove! Demon beasts will come in a few minutes and there must be several high-level ones! If you don\u2019t want to lose your lives, let us in!\u201d A forthright voice cried fretfully.\u201cGet lost! Our cave is too small for you people!\u201d Shi Yan was rather cold, showing not the slightest amount of friendliness.Their cave was not big enough so it could only hold six people, and counting the rock at the entrance, it could only hold five people at most. According to their breaths, Shi Yan could tell there were six of them, which was too much for the small cave.\u201cSteve, come with me, let\u2019s break it!\u201d One of them shouted coldly with impatience.\u201cSure!\u201d\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dTwo streams of explosive power struck the rock at the same time, andan enormous force blasted out from within the hard rock at once!Withthe dull booms, the hard rock which was being supported by Shi Yan and Di Yalan was comminuted into dozens of pieces.\u201cKaka! Kaka!\u201dThe rock segments fell on the ground one by one and suddenly the light shined into the dim entrance.Three people got the chance and slipped into the cave at once.The leader of the group, who was around thirty years old and wore a silver warrior uniform, looked cold and arrogant. He glanced at Shi Yan and the two girls, then jeered, \u201cA mere Human-Level warrior dares to block us. You are going beyond your depth, young man!\u201d\u201cBig brother, kill them!\u201d Another rude young man urged, \u201cThis cave is only capable of holding six people. Our people can\u2019t come in if they still stay here!\u201d\u201cYou three get out of the cave right now! Or I will kill you in no time!\u201d The man in silver uniform demanded, \u201cYou are definitely no match for us! We have two Human-Level and four Nascent-Level warriors. You\u2019d better not waste our time.\u201dThe three warriors who were standing at the opening of the cave looked at Shi Yan and Di Yalan coldly, seemingly prepared to take action at any time, as a dim light was gradually sent out from their bodies.\u201cBig brother, look at the girls, woah!\u201d Another skinny short young man found Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die extraordinarily beautiful after he adapted to the dimness in the cave and couldn\u2019t help but shout out.\u201cChuck, do you want the girls or our brothers outside the cave?\u201dThe leader grunted.That skinny young man smiled with embarrassment, \u201cDon\u2019t be pissed my brother, I\u2019m just kidding. Of course I want my brothers! Women are everywhere, right? Ha, now that we got so much treasure from the Silver Thunder Wolf\u2019s cave, we can get women whenver we want! Haha!\u201d\u201cWhy are you still there?\u201d The warrior taking the lead looked hideous suddenly as he was about to fight.\u201cFight!\u201d Di Yalan shouted as she lifted her shortsword, \u201cThere are all demon beasts out of the cave. We would still die even if we get out!\u201d\u201cHehe, please run away as far as you can and take the demon beasts with you, then we will be safe.\u201d That rude young man burst into laughter, \u201cOr, do you think you can even be alive here?\u201d\u201cSister Lan, let\u2019s go out.\u201d After a deep breath, Shi Yan calmed down, then he dragged her, \u201cQuick! We may escape if we run quickly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible\u2026\u201d Di Yalan was dragged away by Shi Yan before she could finish her sentence.Mu Yu Die had lifted herself up long ago, thus she walked up after them.As her slim figure passed by that skinny short man, that guy stretched out his hand toward her butt, \u201cGorgeous, forgive me. We can be closer if we meet again.\u201dMu Yu Die got frightened and rushed out of the cave as fast as she can. But unfortunately, that guy still touched her slim waist, which made her furious.Outside the cave, the three men of Nascent Level had been impatient for a long time.Seeing the three getting out of the cave, the three warriors outside wandered their eyes on Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die lustfully. Then they walked into the cave reluctantly and complimented, \u201cBrother, there should be two beauties! Your Martial Spirit is so great that you could even sense the cave here from so far away! We wouldn\u2019t have managed in collecting so much treasure in the Silver Thunder Wolf\u2019s cave if it hadn\u2019t been your magical Martial Spirit!\u201d\u201cHaha! We really harvested a lot this time! A Martial Skill of Spirit Level! We can get what we six want with this book when we go back to the God-blessed Empire ! Then we can own whichever women we are fond of!\u201d The rude guy in the cave chuckled.\u201cThanks to our big brother\u2019s Martial Spirit. It can identify the stream of life in the surroundings. That\u2019s too damn good!\u201dThe six of them occupied Shi Yan and his friends\u2019 cave, and started to discuss softly in it.\u201cYou three, go as far as you can! It\u2019s still early enough for you to leave now! Once the demon beasts came, you can in no way escape from them!\u201d The leader demanded confidently, \u201cIf you are still going to stay at the entrance, please excuse my rudeness.\u201dUnder the bright moonlight, Shi Yan was wearing an icy and terrifying expression.Terrible demon beasts howls were comingfrom all directions. They were just gathering towardthis way, for apparently they knew there were humans in this area.Judging from the situation now, this area would be encircled by demon beasts soon.If they left now, they would become those demon beasts\u2019 target; even if they guided the demon beasts to other areas, they would be kill by them eventually.Shi Yan knew clearly that the leader didn\u2019t kill them because he wanted them to run away and distract those demon beasts, so that those six warriors could survive.\u201cDing Yan! Why don\u2019t we just have a nasty fight with them! We could also be killed by the demon beasts if we get out of the cave! If we run away, we would die in vain! Why not drag those warriors in with us!\u201dDi Yalan stared at Shi Yan in rage.For his safty\u2019s sake, Shi Yan had told them his name was Ding Yan, though Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die rarely called him by his full name.However, since Di Yalan was strongly against Shi Yan\u2019s decision, she shouted out his full name..Mu Yu Die turned rather pale and she said in a miserable voice, \u201cI would rather be killed by the Dark World than be eaten up by demon beasts. Sister Lan, let\u2019s finish ourselves now and attract those demon beasts here.\u201d\u201cCome here!\u201d Shi Yan frowned as he caught Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die, separately with each of his hands, to the corner of the entrance, keeping them away from the middle of the opening.\u201cWhat?\u201d Di Yalan flew into a rage, \u201cYou want to run away, don\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cRun away? Am I such an easy-going person?\u201d Shi Yan broadened his mouth and looked hideous. Abruptly, he took out an iron ball out of his chest and waved it at the girls.Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die were stunned at first. Soon they realized and smirked, then took several steps away from the opening again.Shi Yan nooded, and as soon as the girls found their positions, he suddenly rushed to the entrance.As he reached the entrance, he swiftly threw the iron ball into the cave and left in an instant.\u201cBang!\u201dThere was a devastating explosion in the cave as sharp splinters flew in all directions inside, some of which flew out of the cave and cut the bushes outside into pieces.Terrible cries came from the entrance of the cave.\u201cOld Steve!\u201d\u201cMicky!\u201d\u201cBrother Teddy! Brother Teddy!\u201d\u201cBrother Bob! I\u2026 I am hurt!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPainful cries, combined with a strong bloody smell, came out of the cave.Shi Yan signalled Di Yalan and went into the cave again.Shi Yan was looking at the chaos in the cave at the entrance, ashe sneered, \u201cHey everybody? Wasit fun?\u201dThe three men on the ground had turned into honeycombs with wounds all over their bodies. That rude guy was among them, with his head cut through.The leader, that skinny, short man and another fat guy were still alive.The other three had protected them. Though they too were wounded, those splinters didn\u2019t hurt their vital places.Their limbs were filled with bleeding wounds, and the leader seemed badly hurt, for his abdomen was bleeding hard.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe cave was so small, and once the Star Bomb exploded, they had nowhere to hide. If it weren\u2019t for those three dead warriors who stood in front of them, there would\u2019ve been no chance for anyone to survive.\u201cI\u2019m gonna strip your skin!\u201d Their leader had his eyes split, and he was too angry.\u201cSuch dense Profound Qi.\u201d Shi Yan took a deep breath and enjoyed a lot.As he was talking, his muscles contracted slowly and his body got more and more dry.A freezing, insane, amd murderous smell flew out of Shi Yan\u2019s body slowly, forming into a white thin fog, which spread all over him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 37 The KillingInside the cave, there were three dead bodies, three wounded warriors, and Shi Yan.Shi Yan jumped into the cave. However, he did nothing but simply just stood there, feeling the blowing waves of Profound Qi coming from those three fresh bodies right towards him. The Profound Qi flew into the 720 meridians of his body. The waves were so strong that his meridians even felt a little pain.Naturally, Shi Yan\u2019s body went mad again. All his muscles had shrunken so badly that he suddenly looked even thinner.There was a wave of evil energy quickly spreading from the white smoke covering his whole body. With the coldest and cruelest spirits, this energy quickly fulfilled the entire cave.Those evil spirits seemed to have some bewitching magic power.Once those three wounded warriors breathed in some of this white smoke, their mind was instantly fulfilled with a crazy urge of slaughtering as well.\u201cYou fucking son of a bitch! I\u2019m gonna skin you alive!\u201dThe leader of them shouted loudly, with a creepy green poppy flower suddenly appearing on his palm. That poppy flower was made purely by his Profound Qi and looked just as alive, growing and expanding with astonishing speed on his palm.Only within seconds, that green poppy flower had become the size of a cattail leaf, with a freezing light shining in the middle of the bud and a green light diffusing around it.At his sway of hand, that giant poppy flower instantly flew right towards at Shi Yan.That poppy flower was like an open bloody mouth. It was trying to bite Shi Yan right on his head, seemingly trying to swallow his entire head into its bud.\u201cHe!\u201dA roaring sound came out of Shi Yan. He had quickly concentrated the streams of negative energy that he absorbed from those dead warriors, and let that energy out from all the meridians covering his whole body, which soon formed into three ghost shadows in front of his body.Those ghost shadows were floating in front of his body in the scariest way, with their eyes filled with utmost endless resentment to this world.\u201cSteve! Micky! Teddy!\u201dThe thin warrior was instantly filled with horror. He stared, dumbstruck, at those floating ghost shadows Shi Yan had in front of his body, and couldn\u2019t help screaming.Those three ghost shadows looked exactly like those three warriors right before they died!The leader was also pretty astonished. He couldn\u2019t help but take a step back. However, that creepy poppy flower didn\u2019t stop its move and continued to try biting on Shi Yan\u2019s head.\u201cBreak!\u201dShi Yan waved his fist and sent out a web of white smoke which was tangled and concentrated with all kinds of negative energy. Those streams of negative energy combined together into a silver snake and suddenly shot into the center of that poppy flower.\u201cBoom!\u201dThat poppy flower exploded into pieces, with its freezing light suddenly splashing everywhere like a creepy firework; beautiful but strange.\u201cLook out!\u201dThe leader shouted out. He quickly moved forward and covered the other two guys with both of his hands. There were also spots of weird lights shining inside his palms. He waved his hands and surprisingly captured all the freezing light coming towards him all into his chest.Shi Yan had the cruelest look on his face. He started to operate his mind power and petrify his whole body. In this dark cave, his entire body became brown and as tough as the steel.Dozens of freezing dots of light shot towards him again with buzzing sounds. However, they were all blocked by his petrified body. Only a small proportion of the freezing energy filtered into his body through all his petrified muscles.The freezing energy was rushing and bumping inside his body. However, its power was mostly blocked by his petrified muscles.Only after a few seconds, Shi Yan\u2019s body had already returned to normal, and wasn\u2019t influenced by the freezing energy any more.\u201cShi Yan!\u201dDi Yalan rushed into the cave. Seeing Shi Yan confronting those three warriors all by himself, she couldn\u2019t help but scream and ask him with worry, \u201cAre you OK?\u201d\u201cUse your Blue Magic Flame to cover for me. Hold back the leader. I will kill the other two Nascent Warriors first.\u201dShi Yan gave his order with a cruel face. He then started operating his mind. Those three ghost shadows floating in front of him suddenly started rushing towards those three warriors like starving wolves towards its prey.The tiny stone cave could barely hold all these people. Once an attack was launched, there was no room to escape. The opponent could only defend themselves with everything they had.Seeing those three ghost shadows coming towards their way, the three warriors in the cave all seemed pretty terrified.People are naturally intimidated by the unknown.Especially because, one minute ago, those three ghost shadows were still their dearest brothers!The three of them tried to escape, but only to find their way already blocked by the stones. There was nowhere for them to go.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared!\u201dThe leader shouted. The freezing light he just withdrew into his chest was transformed and turned into an icy, silver light shield, sheltering the three of them.Shi Yan sniffed secretly on the inside, and continued to operate his mind power.The three ghost shadows stopped in front of the three warriors. With the silver light shield in between, those ghost shadows waved their fists and started to make terrifying postures such as biting and gobbling, showing all their utmost resentment in their eyes towards those warriors.All kinds of negative energy had gathered into the eyes of those ghost shadows, and through eye contact, flew right into the mind of those three warriors.Almost instantly, as they were impacted by the negative energy, the three warriors felt like they were thrown into the lowest level of the hell. Countless terrifying and screaming ghosts were coming towards their way, dragging them towards the endless hell. There was no way for them to get out.The faces of the three warriors became stiff, and their eyes became lifeless, all with the most terrified look on their face.\u201cSister Lan! Break their ice light shield!\u201d Shi Yan shouted.Di Yalan trembled a little. She didn\u2019t give much thought, but quickly threw out her Blue Magic Flame which she already gotten ready on her palm. The flame turned into an agile phoenix and shot itself into that silver light shield.\u201cChi-chi!\u201dThe silver light shield was instantly melted under the heat of the Blue Magic Flame. The shield formed by the leader\u2019s Profound Qi was obviously too weak in front of the attack of Di Yalan\u2019s Blue Magic Flame Martial Spirit , and suddenly cracked a fist sized hole.The three ghost shadows took advantage of this crack and quickly sneaked in like a light smoke. The ghosts separated and sneaked into the body of the three warriors respectively.Shi Yan suddenly rushed forward towards them.He had all his Profound Qi flowing into his arms like crazy. When he was moving his arms, there was even a deep bursting sound in the air, like a mountain was falling apart.The white mist entangling his iron fist had already concentrated and turned into a layer of pale liquid matter covering his arms, making his bony arm look even more terrifying, like the sharp claw of an evil ghost.\u201cPoo!\u201dShi Yan\u2019s arm was like a sharp sword, and pierced right through the chest of that thin guy who once mouthed about Mu Yu Die. He used his fist to punch that guy so hard that he fell onto the wall of that cave with a deep sound.\u201cYou\u2019re seeking death, you fucking bastard!\u201dThe Human Level leader warrior suddenly woke up in the middle of his nightmare. Seeing another one of his brothers miserably die in front of his eyes, he couldn\u2019t help but shout with anger. He generated a huge silver light ball on his palm and pushed it hard towards Shi Yan\u2019s chest.There was an overwhelming gravity falling towards Shi Yan, which, combining with the freezing cold ice power, exploded, all of a sudden, on Shi Yan\u2019s chest.\u201cDeng! Deng! Deng!\u201dShi Yan had to step back some distance before he could stabilize his body.He just took the full blow of tough a warrior at the Human Level right on his chest. However, Shi Yan\u2019s chest only hurt a little after taking the hit. He checked his body for a second only to see his body completely intact.That icy blow only froze his chest a little but didn\u2019t manage to hurt him.So this is the second stage of the Petrification Martial Spirit! How awesome is that!Shi Yan was actually wildly laughing on the inside. He kept operating his own Profound Qi, guiding it rapidly through his own veins and vessels in his chest. His Profound Qi was like a warm stream of energy, quickly recovering his chest from the freezing light attack by blowing within his veins and vessels.Di Yalan, with a dagger in hand, rushed to the front, fighting with the leader. Her phoenix made of the Blue Magic Flames was her strongest power, fighting against the leader together with her. The Blue Flame Phoenix could not only counter all the freezing power that the warrior threw out, but could also control some of his creepy attacks.\u201cAre you guys all right?\u201dMu Yu Die entered the cave with both hands covering her nose. When she stepped inside, she almost puked instantly due to the strong bloody smell.\u201cPile up the bodies!\u201dShi Yan ordered with a frown. He didn\u2019t wait for Mu Yu Die to respond before he quickly rushed towards the other Nascent Warrior who was still drowning in his nightmares, just like a haunting ghost.\u201cNo! Little Joe!\u201dThe leader suddenly changed the look on his face. He instantly screamed out anxiously.Even in his wildest dreams, he could not imagine that this guy in front of him, who was merely a Nascent Warrior, could take on his full blow, and not only survive, but also fight back again!But he himself was a Warrior of the Human Level who had already reached the Second Sky!\u201cBrother Trump!\u201dHearing his name being called, that unconscious warrior suddenly woke up and couldn\u2019t help but scream.But this was also the last sound that he would ever make in this world.The next moment, he stopped screaming as his back bumped hard onto the stone wall and blood came out through all his meridians.Shi Yan\u2019s body was as forceful as a mountain because of the scary explosion power that he got from going mad. . He simply just bumped this guy to death onto the stone wall , and all of his bones broke into pieces.\u201cNo! Little Joe!\u201dThe leader couldn\u2019t help but howl. Seeing all his brothers die in such a horrible way one after another right in front of his eyes, he started to regret entering this cave for the first time.He regretted that he ever provoked Shi Yan, this mad slaughterer; regretted even setting foot into The Dark Forest.\u201cMiss Mu, quick, pile up these bodies!\u201dShi Yan took a harsh look on Mu Yu Die who had already completely lost her mind, and said with a cold voice, \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to die, then move quickly!\u201dMu Yu Die couldn\u2019t help but tremble. Under those cold-blooded eyes of Shi Yan, she had to kneel down to deal with all these nasty bloody bodies and move these ugly broken body parts to a corner of the stone cave, piling them up one by one.\u201cShi Yan, come help me!\u201dDi Yalan screamed, \u201cThis guy\u2019s Profound Qi is too strong. I cannot handle him for much longer!\u201dThe demon beasts started to gather outside the stone cave, with waves of roaring and howling coming towards them. It seemed that before long, this valley would be covered with demon beasts. Of course Di Yalan understood the value of time. They must finish this fight and kill the leader as soon as possible.\u201cI\u2019ll be right there!\u201dShi Yan rushed forward and stood right in front of Di Yalan facing the leader.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe silver freezing light appeared again on the palm of the leadery, with another strike shooting right at Shi Yan\u2019s chest.\u201cHey hey!\u201dShi Yan put on a scary grin on his face. With the help of his Petrification Martial Spirit which had already reached the second stage, he took this hit just fine. Now thisleader was forced into a corner of the stone cave. There was no way for him to escape.The phoenix made by the Blue Magic Flame took the chance and also flew over. It soon landed on the shoulder of the leader.The flames surrounded and spread rapidly on the guy\u2019s shoulders just like a tendril of vines. Soon there was the smell of burning flesh on his shoulders. The flames became stronger and stronger, and then spread from his shoulders to his abdomen then to his waist, until burning his little brother under the belt.\u201cAh!\u201dThe lead guy started to scream with great pain. He started to hit Shi Yan like crazy, desperate to break Shi Yan\u2019s defense and get out of this cave.\u201cYou tried so hard to get in, but now you wanna leave? Hey, hey, too late for that!\u201dShi Yan put on his Dark Light Shield and used his Petrification Martial Spirit to block all his crazy attacks with a mocking grin on his face. Despite his terribly thin body, Shi Yan was standing there like a steady stone. No matter how hard the attacks were, he just stood there without moving an inch.Di Yalan found an opportunity to get in. With her dagger in hand, she pierced one leg of the leader almost within a second.\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me! I\u2019ve got the treasures we stole from the cave of the Silver Thunder Wolf. Please just let me go. I will give them all to you! Please!\u201d The leader screamed and begged with his twisted face.\u201cI will take the treasures, and your life as well!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Yan put on a scary grin. Countless streams of white smoke suddenly wrapped tightly around this guy\u2019s body. And with this man\u2019s most terrified screams, Shi Yan pierced his throat with one finger.The leader soon lost the light in his eyes. His body also started to become soft and fell onto the ground slowly.Shi Yan didn\u2019t take another look on that man\u2019s body. He quickly turned around and looked at Mu Yu Die with a scary face. He cursed in a cold voice, \u201cSo useless! Still haven\u2019t finished with these bodies?\u201dMu Yu Die was already pretty upset. She was trying very hard at dealing with these bodies. For a girl who hated nasty stuff like this, it was not an easy task to pile up all these bodies. Don\u2019t even expect her to be extra efficient, which was almost impossible.Shi Yan didn\u2019t waste a lot words on her. He simply sniffed and piled up all the bodies himself with a frown on his face and blood all over his hands. He said with a cold voice, \u201cThe demon beasts are coming towards this valley together. Whether we can survive this still depends on God\u2019s will.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He started to cover the cave entrance with the nearby bushes and twigs.Although the battle between the two groups was for the cave, both knew of the importance of the nearby foliage. As such, none of the nearby vegetation was moved or destroyed when approaching the cave.However, with the eruption of the \u201cStar Bomb\u201d, the bushes at the cave entrance were damaged and cut into pieces. Fortunately, the bushes near the cave entrance were still intact.Now what Shi Yan needed to do was to move the bushes on each side to the middle of the cave entrance to perfectly cover the entire opening.Shi Yan was breathing smoothly and paying great attention to his movements. He was acting with great caution and moving the bushes and leaves towards the entrance of the cave slowly, inch by inch, for fear that the demon beasts outside would discover something strange in this place.With the roaring of the demon beasts getting more and more frequent, they sensed that God knows how many demon beasts had gathered in the valley outside the cave.Shi Yan had a serious look on his face and was acting extremely nervous. Sweat was secretly coming out of his forehead. Even his back started to become wet with sweat.When he finally dragged the last large bush into the cave entrance, even his arms were slightly trembling, as if he had made huge efforts to finish this job.\u201cAre you OK?\u201d Di Yalan asked with care.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, I\u2019m just a little tired.\u201dShi Yan shook his head. His face had turned extraordinarily pale. He stopped to think for a moment and then said, \u201cYou two be careful later. If we are ever found by those demon beasts, you must make every effort to guard the cave entrance!\u201dDi Yalan nodded and added with care, \u201cYeah, I get it. But what on earth has happened to you? I just saw you kicking the ass of that Warrior of the Human Level with my own eyes, but how come you\u2019ve become so weak right now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s exactly because I made such great efforts to fight with him, that I\u2019ve become so weak right now.\u201d Shi Yan sat down with his legs crossed and refused to give any more explanation.At this critical time, surprisingly, he closed his eyes to rest!This was actually the side effect of \u201cRampage\u201d kicking off inside his body.Every time he performed \u201cRampage\u201d, his body would suffer great pressure.The Rampage Martial Skill required the excitation of all kinds of negative energy within one\u2019s meridians. The power of \u201cRampage\u201d served as a double-edged sword, giving you power far beyond your own Level for a very short amount time, but on the other hand, also making you more exhausted afterwards.After all, those negative energies were way too evil and creepy.When these negative energies spilt over from his meridians, they were hurting his body as well. Every time when he finished \u201cRampage\u201d, he would be wrapped in waves of exhaustion, weakening his body very quickly.Sitting right there in the cave, Shi Yan felt that both his arms and legs were weak and powerless. The meridians all over his body were also hurting like hell.The Profound Qi he absorbed from those six fresh corpses had also rushed into his meridians, filling his body with wave after wave of strong power. While his meridians were processing and purifying this Profound Qi with high speed, the negative energies would take advantage of this to sneak out and slowly rot his mind and sanity.At this moment, he couldn\u2019t do anything that required effort. His meridians were still busy processing and purifying all this new Profound Qi. If he couldn\u2019t relax his body, he wouldn\u2019t be able to achieve a quality recovery at all.Therefore, he made a sensible decision to leave everything else alone. He just sat still, keeping a peaceful mind for the recovery.Seeing him sitting and resting with both eyes closed, the other two women, Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die, also looked pretty serious. They concentrated on observing the movements outside the cave.The demon beasts were still moving inside the valley. There were even some demon beasts around their cave and they seemed to be searching for something.Both Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan were guarding the entrance of the cave very nervously. They didn\u2019t dare to take any chance to relax.Di Yalan was holding her dagger firmly in her hand, looking outside warily through the gaps between the bushes covering the cave entrance, fearing that some demon beast would suddenly jump in.They were both aware that demon beasts had an extremely sensitive sense of smell. They were worried that those beasts might find them through the bloody smell in the air. They knew that once their cave was discovered by any of those demon beasts, they had to guard this cave no matter what the price was.\u201cDeng! Deng!\u201dA three-headed hound was coming towards them with its three giant heads shaking in the air. It seemed to have found something. Its six eyes on its three heads were scanning around as if it had discovered something unusual.Oh, crap!Di Yalan suddenly changed the look on her face, grabbing her dagger even more firmly in her hand. With sweat pouring out of her palm, she focused on the three-headed hound with all of her attention and didn\u2019t dare to move her eyes away for a second.Di Yalan was already extremely tense and was ready to start a fight at any time.The three-headed hound was a Level Three demon beast, equaling a human Warrior of the Human Level, which was pretty tough to deal with.Moreover, this demon beast possessed an extraordinarily sharp sense of smell. The bloody smell inside the cave might be able to fool other demon beasts, but it could not necessarily hide from this three-headed hound.Due to her anxiety, Di Yalan\u2019s entire body became stiff and tense. Her hand which held the dagger was also shaking slightly, which meant that her Profound Qi was moving very fast through her veins and vessels.\u201cAw!\u201dRight at that moment, a howl from the Silver Thunder Wolf came from the distance which alerted the whole valley and outmatched all the roaring and shouting of the other demon beasts.\u201cI am Gan Xiao from the Medicine Valley. I came to the Dark Forest simply to collect medicine for myself. I have never stepped into your cave! Silver Thunder Wolf, I know you are good, but I am not afraid of you. If you continue to harass and kill my people, I will not let you go easy!\u201d A low dark voice came from the distance.\u201cAw!\u201dThe Silver Thunder Wolf started howling again in the distance.Hearing this howling sound, the three-headed hound, which was about to approach the cave where the three of them were hiding, suddenly stopped right there.It paused a little and quickly turned around, and started running towards the howling of the Silver Thunder Wolf in high speed.Upon the howling of the Silver Thunder Wolf, the demon beasts gathered in the valley were also starting to take off, leaving the valley for the Silver Thunder Wolf.The Silver Thunder Wolf and Gan Xiao seemed about to have a huge fight.Di Yalan suddenly relaxed. She felt so weak that she sat right down on the ground with her body covered with sweat.If only that three-headed hound had moved a little further forward, maybe even a couple of meters, then their cave would have definitely be compromised. And once that three-headed hound had discovered the cave, the other demon beasts in the valley would most definitely have followed it over here as well.If that really happened, there was no way that the three of them could have ever escaped those demon beasts!\u201cSister Lan, are you OK?\u201d Mu Yu Die was wiping the sweat off her forehead with a handkerchief stained with blood. She also sat down on the ground with the stone wall behind her.\u201cIt\u2019s OK.\u201d Di Yalan smiled softly, but still sighed. \u201cWe were very lucky back then. If the Silver Thunder Wolf didn\u2019t have its eyes on Gan Xiao from the Medicine Valley and didn\u2019t suddenly call for all the demon beasts to gather around it, I am afraid that we wouldn\u2019t have been able to make it through this.\u201d\u201cYeah, I was also pretty scared just now.\u201d Mu Yu Die\u2019s pretty face also looked quite pale. She added in a low voice, \u201cI was even prepared to commit suicide back then.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ever have that thought unless we have no other options.\u201dShi Yan sniffed. He suddenly opened his eyes, and ordered with a frown, \u201cIf you have no better things to do, how about searching through the bags and pockets of those six warriors? Just to see what kind of treasure they had stolen from the cave of that Silver Thunder Wolf.\u201dHearing him saying this, Di Yalan\u2019s eyes suddenly lit up. She agreed with excitement, \u201cThat\u2019s right! The Silver Thunder Wolf is a Level Seven demon beast, a top level creature within the Dark Forest! It is said that the Silver Thunder Wolf is a highly intelligent creature, and that it has killed dozens of high level warriors in the Dark Forest. It must have collected many treasures from those dead warriors and stored them inside its cave. The treasures those warriors have stolen must be extraordinary!\u201d\u201cI heard that there is a practice method for a Spirit Level Martial Skill\u2026\u201d Shi Yan said with a cool voice.\u201cHe!\u201d Di Yalan replied with her face filled with joy and her beautiful eyes lit up with excitement, \u201cSpirit Level Martial Skills are very rare. Even for the royal families from our Fire Empire, there are only five kinds of Spirit Level Martial Skills. Any practice method for a Spirit Level Martial Skill would be worth millions, and countless big families would even be willing to kill for it.\u201d\u201cThen you should really search through them very carefully.\u201d Shi Yan nodded and closed his eyes again, seemingly having something on his mind.Of course he knew how precious so-called Spirit Level Martial Skills were.Across the Fire Empire, the God-blessed Empire, and the Merchant Union, there were around 100 warriors who had reached the Earth Level and the Nirvana Level for a warrior. However, among all these 100 warriors, those with Spirit Level Martial Skills only counted for a quarter of those warriors!And among that quarter, some were even studying and practicing the same kind of Spirit Level Martial Skills.According to the rumor, across the entire the Fire Empire, the God-blessed Empire, and the Merchant Union, there were only 18 kinds of Spirit Level Martial Skills that were already known to the humankind.And each and every kind of those Spirit Level Martial Skills were all possessed by various powerful families or warriors that ruled their own little kingdoms.Such as the Shi Family.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe Shi Family had possessed various kinds of Martial Skills, such as for the Mortal Level and the Sacred Level. However, it only had one kind of Martial Skill of the Spirit Level, which the Master of the Family, Shi Jian, believed to be the most precious family treasure. Even the his own descendants had no idea where he had kept that Spirit Level Martial Skill.\u201cIt seems we are in huge luck!\u201dDi Yalan\u2019s eyes were filled with joy. She dug out the backpack of the warrior leader with excitement and didn\u2019t waste any time opening it.A strong wave of silver light started to shine out from his backpack. The stone cave that was once buried in darkness was suddenly lit up and became as bright as the outside!\u201cWow!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39 Three types of FlamesThree shining crystals appeared from the bag and brightly lit the cave.One of them was rhombus shaped and the other two were oval shaped. They all looked crystal clear and were diffusing waves.Obviously there was an extraordinary energy hidden within them.\u201cDemon Crystals!\u201dDi Yalan screamed with joy.\u201cAhhh!\u201dMu Yu Die shouted after her and said joyfully, \u201cSeems we are so lucky that we\u2019ve been bestowed with Demon Crystals! Hehe, if we can get out of the Dark Forest alive we could spend the rest of our lives in luxury with these three Demon Crystals.\u201dDi Yalan squatted and began to examine the three Demon Crystals carefully. After a long time, she observed, \u201cThey must be from Level Six demon beasts, but I can hardly tell what Demon Beasts they are from.\u201d\u201cSister Lan, I have heard that demon beasts can directly absorb the energy in Demon Crystals. The Silver Thunder Wolf owned these Demon Crystals. Why didn\u2019t it didn\u2019t take the energy inside of them to strengthen itself? \u201d\u201cIt is said that the Silver Thunder Wolf gave birth to a pup and the best way for it to grow up is to absorb the energy in Demon Crystals. If it is true, then I guess the three Demon Crystals from these Level Six demon beasts were prepared by the Silver Thunder Wolf for its pup.\u201d\u201cCould be.\u201d\u201cThe energy in Demon Crystals is the best material for alchemists and blacksmiths. They can easily tell what demon beast the Demon Crystal is from in just one look. Hmm, three Demon Crystals. We can have one each, right?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t help so I can\u2019t take one.\u201dMu Yu Die shook her head, and she took a glimpse at Shi Yan who was training with his eyes closed. \u201cI think you two should share them. If it hadn\u2019t been for me, you wouldn\u2019t have got into trouble\u2026\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s discuss this after he wakes up.\u201d Di Yalan frowned, and continued to dig in the bag.\u201cAh!\u201dWith another exclamation, Di Yalan took out a transparent jade bottle from the bag which was on the ground. She suddenly lost her train of thought as she stared at the red liquid inside.The liquid in the jade bottle was like a flame. As Di Yalan shook it gently, the flame also danced to the rhythm.Di Yalan seemed to recall something as she stared at the liquid in the jade bottle.After a long time, Di Yalan\u2019s thin body trembled and she screamed, \u201c Earth Core Flame Essence!\u201d\u201cCongratulations Sister Lan!\u201dMu Yu Die was stunned at first, then she realized something and yelled happily, \u201cSister Lan, it will benefit you the most! Haha! You really harvested a lot from this journey. You have not only awoken your Martial Spirit, but you\u2019ve also gotten this Earth Core Flame Essence.\u201dDi Yalan was so delighted that she couldn\u2019t help but keep nodding her head excitedly as she shook the jade bottle in her hand. She babbled incoherently, \u201cI, I\u2019ve never expected that I would be so lucky! Ha! It\u2019s Earth Core Flame Essence!\u201dJust then, Shi Yan finished three Big Circulations after training silently for a long time. He opened his eyes and asked, \u201cThis Earth Core Flame Essence, what does it have to do with you?\u201d\u201cWhat? How come you don\u2019t know about Earth Core Flame Essence?\u201d Di Yalan exclaimed in surprise, \u201cIt is common sense! Hell! Are you a warrior or not?\u201dShi Yan was quite indifferent. \u201cI\u2019m all ears.\u201d\u201cDo you know there are three types of flames? As in Sky, Earth and Human?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cWhat? You don\u2019t even know about that?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201dDi Yalan shook her head bitterly for she totally had no idea about Shi Yan.After a short pause, she explained leisurely, \u201cThe three types of flames refer to Human Flames, Earth Flames and Sky Flames. Human Flames, like my Blue Magic Flame, are the magical flames in human warriors, which is a vital factor for alchemists and blacksmiths to train with. Every high-level alchemist or blacksmith owns a Human Flame, because only it can raise their skill to the highest.\u201dShi Yan nodded without a reply, and didn\u2019t move his eyes away from Di Yalan.After a short hesitation, Di Yalan added, \u201cEarth Flames and Sky Flames exist between the earth and sky, such as the Earth Core Flame in the center of the earth and the Volcano Core Flame from the bottom of a volcano, and are formed naturally. The difference between Earth Flames and Sky Flames, is that the latter has a consciousness.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d Shi Yan was intrigued.\u201cNatural flames without a consciousness are called Earth Flames, which are regarded as a treasure like precious stones. As for a Sky Flame, it can think, just like humankind. It is immortal and has magical power, which is the most special life entity in this world. Some Sky Flames were formed at the beginning of the Grace Mainland.\u201dThough Shi Yan still looked indifferent, this stirred a storm in his mind.He was a foreigner to this world and all the knowledge he obtained from his own world was totally different from that of this world.Before, he had never thought that these flames could even think and have wisdom.Hearing that, Shi Yan got to know the magical charm of this world more profoundly.In this world, he met many mysterious things which he had never even dreamt of, such as Martial Spirits, demon beasts, and so forth\u2026\u201cSo this Earth Core Flame Essence is an Earth Flame?\u201d After thinking for a long while, Shi Yan finally asked.\u201cThis is the leftover liquid after an Earth Core Flame turned into a Sky Flame. It\u2019s neither Earth Flame nor Sky Flame, but something in between.\u201d \u201d\u201cAn Earth Flame can turn into a Sky Flame?\u201d Shi Yan was shocked again.\u201cOf course, millions of years is a long time. Over time, Earth Flames have the chance to gain consciousnesses and turn into a Sky Flame, but the possibility is very small. Not all Earth Flames have the chance for evolution.\u201dDi Yalan was amused, \u201cBut this is the liquid left behind before the Earth Core Flame turned into a Sky Flame. This liquid is very precious for people owning Human Flames.\u201d\u201cHow precious?\u201d\u201cIt can enhance the Human Flame and improve one\u2019s Martial Spirit!\u201d Di Yalan was so joyful that she was almost about to dance. \u201cA Human Flame is from one\u2019s body and can\u2019t be hotter than the flames in nature. Only top level warriors can make their Human Flames as hot as those in the natural world after strengthening them several times\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d Shi Yan nodded, \u201cSo this liquid can enhance your Blue Magic Flame and give it the temperature of an Earth Flame?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s it!\u201d Di Yalan nodded vigorously and stared at him with her shining eyes. After a hesitation, she said in shame, \u201cUhh\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, don\u2019t worry. It\u2019s yours.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Di Yalan was delighted. She felt that she gained some extra advantage and wanted to say something.Shi Yan replied peacefully, \u201cEarth Core Flame Essence is of no use for me and I don\u2019t even possess a Martial Spirit. What do I need it for? Just take it with you.\u201d\u201cBut you can trade for any valuable medicine you want from the three Medicine Kings in Medicine Valley with this liquid.\u201d\u201cWell, you keep it then.\u201d Shi Yan frowned and said casually, \u201cThere was a book on the Martial Skills of Spirit Level?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHearing Shi Yan\u2019s reminder, Di Yalan began to search in the bag again hurriedly.\u201cThis is it.\u201d Di Yalan took out a dark yellow ancient book. She glanced at it and said, \u201cI can\u2019t read these ancient characters. We need to find some specialist to translate it for us.\u201d\u201cLet me have a look.\u201d Shi Yan asked for the book naturally as he stretched out his hand.The previous owner of Shi Yan\u2019s body was a big fan of ancient things. Though he knew nothing about martial arts, he was much better than most so-called scholars in this world when it came to ancient languages and historic sites.Shi Yan took a glimpse at the ancient letters on the book cover as soon as he got the reddish ancient book and mumbled the word naturally, \u201cGravitational Field\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 40 Sharing the Treasure\u201cYou know these ancient letters?\u201d Di Yalan couldn\u2019t help but shout in surprise.\u201cYeah, just a little.\u201dShi Yan nodded, but he didn\u2019t take a closer look at the contents of the book. He just held the book in his arms casually and said with a cool voice, \u201cYou take the bottle of Earth Core Flame Essence, and I will take this practice book for Spirit Level Martial Skills.\u201dDi Yalan nodded to show her agreement. The bottle of Earth Core Flame Essence was indeed extremely precious for her. She was already on top of the world with that little bottle of liquid in her hand.\u201cBut what about these three Demon Crystals?\u201dAfter a while, Di Yalan asked again. And this time, while she was talking, she gave a quick glimpse toMu Yu Die on her side, with a pretty complicated message in her eyes.Shi Yan had already got his book of Spirit Level Martial Skill, which was obviously worth millions. However, until now, only Mu Yu Die hadn\u2019t got anything.Those three Demon Crystals were apparently not as valuable as the Earth Core Flame Essence or the Skill book. Therefore, Di Yalan intended to give those Demon Crystals to Mu Yu Die. However, she was worried that Shi Yan might be against this decision. That\u2019s why she said this to gauge Shi Yan\u2019s reaction.\u201cThen give them to Miss Mu. I\u2019m OK with that.\u201dOf course Shi Yan knew what Di Yalan was up to. He said calmly, \u201cWe cannot leave Miss Mu with nothing. We have both got what we want. How about giving those three Demon Crystals to Miss Mu?\u201d\u201cSure, I\u2019m also fine with this.\u201d Di Yalan smiled with satisfaction. She was quite glad to see Shi Yan being so understanding and considerate.Mu Yu Die looked a little surprised at Shi Yan\u2019s words. She stared at Shi Yan for a moment, and then shook her head and replied with an awkward smile, \u201cI didn\u2019t do anything helpful and have been depending on your protection all this time. I cannot take these three Demon Crystals.\u201d\u201cDie\u2026\u201d Di Yalan wanted to say something but hesitated.\u201cNo, I cannot take them.\u201d Mu Yu Die looked pretty determined. She shook her head firmly, and started to tease herself, \u201cI have become a burden for you. You almost lost your lives protecting me. How can I take these three Demon Crystals? Sister Lan, Ding Yan, I know you are being very kind to me, but I would feel ashamed to take these Demon Crystals.\u201d\u201cThen just take one of them.\u201d Shi Yan said after some hesitation, \u201cAnyway, you must take one of these Demon Crystals. We cannot take such advantage of you.\u201d\u201cYes, at least take one of them.\u201d Di Yalan also insisted.Seeing the two of them both insisting on this, Mu Yu Die found it very hard to deny their kindness any more. She nodded after some hesitation and said, \u201cWell, thanks a lot for your generosity!\u201dShi Yan stopped talking and closed his eyes again, going back to operate the Profound Qi inside his body for recovery.When he cleared his mind and concentrated on the inside, he could clearly feel the changes going on in his body.He didn\u2019t know why, but somehow, just by sitting there, he could feel the pain and soreness in his muscles were quickly disappearing.Shi Yan cleared his mind and focused himself completely on the changes his body was going through.Suddenly, there was a flash of lightning in his mind. His spirit suddenly lit up and it seemed he had realized something.This is the Immortal Martial Spirit!Inside his body, his flesh, muscles, bones, veins, organs and entrails were all undergoing subtle changes.The Immortal Martial Spirit had been secretly repairing his body in a way that he could never understand. His weakness due to breaking out of \u201cRampage\u201d was also gradually returning to normal.Shi Yan was extremely surprised. He realized that the Immortal Martial Spirit could not only recover his wounds, but also offset most of the side effects that he had been suffering from \u201cRampage\u201d!Without the help of the Immortal Martial Spirit, he was almost certain that he would be unable to confront any opponents for the next three days after using \u201cRampage\u201d.However, thanks to the Immortal Martial Spirit, this was no longer the case.With the help of the Immortal Martial Spirit, the soreness and fatigue in his body was slowly disappearing.Judging from the condition of his body right now, it would at most, take one more day for him to recover half of his power. There would be no problem for him to engage in another fight with the enemy then.However, just at that moment when he was gloating in secret, a sudden strong wave of evil and crazy killing intent flared up from the bottom of his heart.This explosion of his negative energy was as fierce as a tsunami and was more destructive than ever!Streams of energy mixed with desperation, fear and resentment were rushing out from the meridians all over his body. They had transformed into waves of spiritual power, roaring through his mind, corrupting his thoughts with an overwhelming force, and altering his morals and personality!This time, he had absorbed the Profound Qi from all four Nascent Warriors as well as the two Warriors of the Human Level. When the six of them breathed their last breath, Shi Yan was right there with them in this stone cave.Therefore, he had captured all the Profound Qi coming from the six warriors without missing a drop, which was way thicker and stronger than all the Profound Qi that he had absorbed before.Therefore, the backlash this time was also fiercer than ever.Although Shi Yan was still sitting there, his breath started to get heavier and heavier, and his body started to tremble slightly. His body was wrapped in a thick web of killing intent, making him appear even more evil to the others.After a few minutes, he guessed that he couldn\u2019t resist this force any more. He suddenly opened his eyes and stared at Di Yalan with desire burning in his eyes. He said in a very low voice, \u201cI\u2019m having that weird thing happen to my body again!\u201dDi Yalan was stunned for one moment, and then quickly blushed all of a sudden. She said to Mu Yu Die in a low voice, \u201cDie, you\u2026 you turn around, and don\u2019t look.\u201dMu Yu Die\u2019s face also quickly went red. She bit her lips a little, turned to the entrance of the cave with her back towards those two people, and said, \u201cYou two be quiet. Please don\u2019t draw the attention of those demon beasts here. I\u2026 I\u2019ll be staying here at the entrance.\u201d\u201cEm.\u201d Di Yalan answered with a very low voice and then quickly threw herself into Shi Yan\u2019s arms.Shortly after, inside the cave, a slapping rhythm could be heard.\u2026After a long time, with a deep moaning and trembling of the body, Shi Yan released his climax inside Di Yalan\u2019s body.From the meridians all over his body, there suddenly sprung streams of magical power.This strange power was wandering around inside his body randomly, with only a small part of it shooting into Di Yalan\u2019s body together with his essence. Most of this strange power was still rushing and bumping around inside his veins and vessels, filling his entire body.Shi Yan suddenly opened his eyes.He pulled up his pants and left Di Yalan, who was still enjoying her moment of bliss, lying on the ground. He quickly went towards Mu Yu Die and said, \u201cMiss Mu, quick, come here!\u201dMu Yu Die was completely shocked by his actions, and couldn\u2019t help moving back. Her pretty face instantly went pale. She cried out with horror, \u201cNo! Don\u2019t come close!\u201d\u201cThe magical power inside my body has just spilled out a little!\u201d Shi Yan was moving towards Mu Yu Die with a heavy panting, and said impatiently, \u201cI am trying my best to control it right now. Let me try and see if I can share some of it with you in order to help you recover your broken veins and muscles inside your body!\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Mu Yu Die started screaming, \u201cNo, no, no, I\u2019m not ready yet! I don\u2019t want to do that with you! Don\u2019t come close!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean that!\u201d Shi Yan roared with a low voice.He could feel the magical power split into dozens of streams, roaming around inside his body across his muscles, veins, flesh and blood, nurturing his Martial Spirits and Profound Qi in his abdomen respectively.With this speed, before long, this magical power would be dispersed all over his body and absorbed entirely.Shi Yan was concentrating more than ever right now. He forcibly blocked a small part of this strange power inside his arm. He was hanging onto this magical power very tightly and planned to inject this part of the power into Mu Yu Die\u2019s body through the spillover of his Profound Qi.Seeing Mu Yu Die continuously backing away, Shi Yan got extremely impatient. He suddenly took a step forward and grabbed Mu Yu Die tightly into his arms.With the soft and nicely curved body of Mu Yu Die suddenly taken into his arms, a refreshing and sweet fragrance instantly kissed his face tenderly, making his spirit excited all of a sudden.\u201cLet go of me!\u201d Mu Yu Die didn\u2019t buy Shi Yan\u2019s theory at all. She was hitting Shi Yan\u2019s chest intensely with her little fists, and struggling with all her might.However, with all of her veins and muscles broken, she couldn\u2019t manage to use her Profound Qi smoothly.With all her power being void, she was no different from a weak fragile little girl, and couldn\u2019t break out of Shi Yan\u2019s arms even a little.\u201cStop struggling! Just be quiet!\u201d Shi Yan locked up his arms even tighter and forced her delicious and delicate body tightly against his own, leaving her no room to struggle.At that moment, Shi Yan made the magical power inside his arms quickly rush towards his wrists, all the way through his palms, and into the veins and muscles on Mu Yu Die\u2019s back.\u201cNow, try your best to move this power to your broken veins and muscles! Quick!\u201d With Mu Yu Die locked up in his arms, Shi Yan quickly whispered into her delicate ears.Mu Yu Die\u2019s ears twitched a lot, and her sweet body couldn\u2019t help trembling. She was silently cursing Shi Yan as a bastard in her heart.However, she clearly felt two strange waves of power flowing into her body through Shi Yan\u2019s palms and circling inside the veins and muscles in her back.Under Shi Yan\u2019s harsh order, Mu Yu Die finally became quiet and stopped her struggling. She started to make her best efforts to feel the magical power inside her body, take control of it, and use it for the recovery of her broken veins and muscles.Holding Mu Yu Die tightly in his arms, feeling the delicious curves of her body, smelling the sweet fragrance from her body, Shi Yan was suddenly distracted and starting to entertain some dirty thoughts in his mind. He couldn\u2019t help the excitement coming from his lower body.\u201cAh!\u201dMu Yu Die screamed with embarrassment. She said in a hurry with a blushed face, \u201cLet go of me now! You\u2026 acting like this\u2026 I \u2026 I cannot calm myself down.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWell, I will let you go for now.\u201d Shi Yan knew that this was not the right time for him to take advantage of her. He nodded and slightly kissed Mu Yu Die\u2019s cheek, \u201cI will take this as a reward for offering you this magical power as a gift.\u201dAfter these words, Shi Yan released Mu Yu Die from his arms and took a few steps back. He then sat down against the stone wall and slowly closed his eyes.Mu Yu Die\u2019s entire face was completely red. She was both embarrassed and annoyed at the same time. She glared at Shi Yan with anger and cursed, \u201cYou dirty bastard!\u201dAfter this, with her beautiful bosoms heaving up and down, Mu Yu Die took a few deep breaths before finally calming down.She understood that given this critical situation, she couldn\u2019t afford to waste any time on blaming Shi Yan. She also quickly sat down and tried to use the magical power that she got from Shi Yan to restore the broken veins and muscles inside her body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41 The Third Sky of Nascent LevelIt was silent outside the valley.The demon beasts had left a long time ago.It was already daytime, as the sunlight filtered into the cave through thick bushes like fire.The three were training cross-legged on the ground with steady breaths.Not knowing how much time had passed, Shi Yan woke up from the serenity. He stood up, stretched his neck and tried to move his body.The Third Sky of Nascent Level!With a deep breath, Shi Yan felt refreshed and his fatigue disappeared at once, while his senses became much more accurate.With the help of the magical power, Shi Yan\u2019s training speed advanced as fast as a shooting arrow, and he increased to the Third Sky of Nascent Level at once!Standing at the entrance of the cave, he was dimly able to perceive the spiritual scent between the sky and the earth.He couldn\u2019t smell the spiritual scent in the air before. But now, it was all so clear to him that he could sense it easily.To perceive the spiritual scent in the air was something only Third Sky of Nascent Level warriors could manage. Once he perceived the spiritual scent, he could train his martial skills faster with its help.As soon as he willed it, his body turned as hard as iron immediately, while his skin turned dark brown and was covered with a vague black light which was similar to the state when he operated his Black Light Shield.\u201cEr?\u201dShi Yan was a little surprised. After a careful examination, he was certain that he wasn\u2019t even utilizing his Black Light Shield with Profound Qi.This was to say, the dark light covering the skin was merely the reaction to reaching the second stage of Petrification Martial Spirit.He smiled after further examination, knowing that the magical change to his skin must have something to do with his Martial Spirit.It was rather bright in the cave now. Shi Yan\u2019s black eyes blinked and began to wander to Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan\u2019s bodies.Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan were still sitting on the ground cross-legged with tightly closed eyes. There was a vague light moving around their bodies, as their Profound Qi operated in their bodies along specific paths.He had injected part of the magical power into Mu Yu Die\u2019s body, because he wanted to know if this magical power could be passed on to others without sexual intercourse.And also, he wanted more help. He was not sure how many foes he would meet during the upcoming journey. It would affect their travel if Mu Yu Die still needed protection.As Di Yalan had said, Mu Yu Die was also a warrior before her tendons broke. If Mu Yu Die recovered, it would be very beneficial for their journey ahead.Because of those thoughts, he gave that small part of the magical power to her.Holding his breath, Shi Yan focused his attention on Mu Yu Die. Suddenly, he felt a strong Profound Qi circulating in her body.A little surprised, he couldn\u2019t help but take several glances at her. After a further thought, he got even more confused\u2026To his amazement, Mu Yu Die\u2019s Profound Qi was more refined than Di Yalan\u2019s, which meant\u2026 Mu Yu Die was a higher level than Di Yalan!Shi Yan was really shocked. He knew Mu Yu Die was a warrior too, but he thought she was no more than Nascent Level.After all, Mu Yu Die was much younger than Di Yalan, thus there was no way she could be a higher-leveled warrior than Di Yalan.But it turned out to be quite the opposite. Shi Yan finally realized that Mu Yu Die was already a Human-Level warrior at such young age. It was an entire level higher than Di Yalan!As he was standing there stunned, he acutely felt that Mu Yu Die\u2019s Profound Qi was calming down gradually.He knew that Mu Yu Die was about to wake up\u2026As expected, before long, Mu Yu Die\u2019s eyelashes shook and she opened her eyes slowly.Two clean and bright eyes suddenly observed the cave, and Mu Yu Die\u2019s delicate little face lit up. She looked like an extremely beautiful and attractive angel in the wood.Shi Yan was dumbstruck as he gazed at such a beautiful creature. He couldn\u2019t even think straight.\u201cDone staring?\u201d Mu Yu Die looked indifferent as she stood up slowly. After stretching herself, she chuckled, \u201cFrom now on, I\u2019m not your burden anymore.\u201dStreams of thin white light flew out from her arms as she was stretching her body. The light soon disappeared in the air\u2026As Mu Yu Die moved her fingers slowly in the air, the light showed up again little by little, and began to shuttle between her smooth fingers.\u201cI haven\u2019t played my zither for so long. Need a practice now.\u201d Mu Yu Die smiled. That smile was like a clean brook in a valley, serene, empty and intoxicating.\u201cYou are much prettier than before.\u201d Gazing at her for a long while, Shi Yan uttered.With her veins connected and the Profound Qi of the top of Human Level flowing in the body, her skin became extremely translucent, while her face turned rosy and her eyes brightened. Mu Yu Die looked so confident that nothing in the world could terrify her.With her strength regained, Mu Yu Die seemed to have turned into another person that she was much more attractive than before.At this moment, in Shi Yan eyes, Mu Yu Die was literally far prettier than Di Yalan and Mo Yanyu. Both her level and temperament transcended those two girls.\u201cThanks.\u201d Mu Yu Die smiled casually, \u201cHow long has it been?\u201d\u201cTwo days, I guess.\u201d Shi Yan hesitated, \u201cI\u2019m not sure either. I just feel that we have stayed in the cave for more than one day. You recovered?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Mu Yu Die nodded confidently, \u201cLet\u2019s leave this cave and set off after Sister Lan wake up.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Shi Yan replied casually, and felt a little bitter.Before, though Mu Yu Die was too naive and too kind, she was quite adorable, just like a lovely little sister.Though Mu Yu Die became more attractive after regaining her energy, her cuteness disappeared, and on the contrary, she made Shi Yan feel some holiness from her, which made Shi Yan a little disappointed.Disappointed, Shi Yan didn\u2019t bother to say anything. Instead, he walked out of the cave and began to wander in the valley.Taking out the book \u201cGravitational Field\u201d on Spirit Level Martial Skills out of his bag, he turned the pages randomly. Without reading it carefully, he put the book into the bag scrupulously, he was now sure that there were letters in the book.Spirit Level Martial Skills could only be trained by warriors of at least Earth Level. But he was just a Nascent Level warrior now, which was a long way from Earth Level. Without advancing, to train with the Spirit Level Martial at a low warrior level would only disturb one\u2019s mind.Because of that reason, Shi Yan put the book away after he was assured it was authentic.A half day later, Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die walked out of the cave together. They were clean, dressed and high spirited, ready to set off.\u201cKid, thank you. I\u2019ve stabilised my level now.\u201d Di Yalan said loudly after she got out.It was rather dangerous a short time after one reached a new level. The warrior needed strengthen his Profound Qi as soon as possible, or he would be hurt in fights and training while his level was still unstable.The essence from Shi Yan took effect again in Mu Yu Die\u2019s body, which stabilised her level, and enabled her to fight without any fear of backlash.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s set off.\u201d Not intending to boast, Shi Yan smiled naturally, and guided them out of the valley.\u2026Seven days later.The three of them finally stepped out of the enormous Dark Forest.Looking at the huge ancient trees behind them, they all felt themselves lucky survivors of a disaster.In those seven days, they never got into any danger.The warriors and mercenaries in the Dark Forest had either died or were wounded, not daring to stay in that dangerous area. The demon beasts led by the Silver Thunder Wolf had also calmed down and didn\u2019t show up again.Since the demon beasts and mercenaries were quiet, their journey became magically smooth. Without meeting any obstacles, they went through the most dangerous area and stepped out of the Dark Forest.They need to pass Silent Town if they were going to the Merchant Union, and they must cross the wide Stone Woods to get to the Silent Woods.The stones in the Stone Woods were all grotesque in shape, which were either as big as a mountain, or as small as a human. In addition, there were also many stone caves, which were natural shelters.There were always brutal warriors lurking in the Stone Woods, killing and trading.Those walking out of the Dark Forest were trade caravans, or warriors and mercenaries who were seeking adventure.Merchants from foreign countries must have goods with them, while those adventurous warriors and mercenaries, who could get out of the Dark Forest alive, must have medicines and materials from demon beasts.These people all had something valuable with them\u2026Therefore, there were people hiding in the Stone Woods for years, who would show up if they found their prey was weak and harvest their goods after a nasty slaughter.Thus, sometimes the Stone Woods were more dangerous than the Dark Forest. A single man who stepped into it, unless he was a Disaster Level warrior, would always get into trouble.\u201cThe Stone woods is very dangerous. Maybe the people from the Dark World are lurking there\u2026\u201d Di Yalan thought for a while and reminded Mu Yu Die.\u201cSomeone will come to our aid in the Stone Woods, no worries.\u201dMu Yu Die smiled and looked back at Shi Yan, \u201cYou are going into the Stone Woods?\u201d\u201cYup. I\u2019m from the Merchant Union, of course I will go back there. \u201d Shi Yan replied.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGood. Then let\u2019s go there together. You will be safe with us in the Stone Woods.\u201d Mu Yu Die looked confident, and before Shi Yan replied, she added, \u201clet\u2019s go into the Stone Woods. Don\u2019t worry, we are safe now.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201d Shi Yan replied. Though he didn\u2019t relax. Once they stepped into the Stone Woods, he was always on alert.From the memories of the other Shi Yan, he knew it was chaos in the Stone Woods. All the powerful parties were involved in it, including the big families from the Merchant Union.He didn\u2019t know what Mu Yu Die had that made her so confident. But he knew they would be killed in an instant if they weren\u2019t cautious.Shi Yan kept calm as he looked around in the woods. Every five steps, he would turn back and examine carefully.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Beside a giant rock.Mo Chaoge, Bernard, and the Crescent Emissary were standing indifferently, seeming to wait for some news.Before long, a Star Emissary appeared on the stone path far away, who was heading in their direction hurriedly.That Star Emissary came near and bowed to the Crescent Emissary, \u201cSir, still no trace of them.\u201dThe Crescent Emissary nodded, and waved his hand, \u201cKeep watching those passes! Be on alert!\u201d\u201cYes Sir!\u201dThe Star Emissary who was in charge of collecting information stepped back silently and disappeared into the piles of stones.One hour later.Big Johnson, who had lost his arm, showed up from another stone path. He walked up to Mo Chaoge and gave a salute, \u201cNo news of them.\u201d\u201cWell.\u201d Mo Chaoge nodded, \u201cKeep watching. I just don\u2019t believe that they won\u2019t come out.\u201d\u201cThird master, is it possible that they were already killed by the demon beasts in the Dark Forest?\u201d Johnson asked after a hesitation, \u201cIt is said that the demon beasts in that area went crazy after we left. Many warriors died because of them. They disappeared for so long, maybe they were killed by those demon beasts.\u201d\u201cCould be.\u201dSurprisingly, Mo Chaoge didn\u2019t oppose, but nodded and said, \u201cBut if they were not killed by demon beasts and slipped through to the Merchant Union, we can do nothing anymore. You know what I mean?\u201d\u201cGot it! I will go and watch right now!\u201d Johnson was enlightened and left immediately.Frowning, Mo Chaoge said to the Crescent Emissary next to him, \u201cLet\u2019s wait for another month, if they still don\u2019t show up, I guess they must have been killed in there. What do you think?\u201d\u201cWell, I agree with you.\u201d The Crescent Emissary agreed. He thought for a moment and said, \u201cI got the information that the Medicine King Gan Xiao and the Silver Thunder Wolf are still fighting in the Dark Forest. But since there are too many demon beasts, Gan Xiao seemed to begin to withdraw. The demon beasts in the Dark Forest have now all gathered around the Silver Thunder Wolf, chasing the Medicine King Gan Xiao and his escorts. That battle area is relatively safe now.\u201d\u201cYou mean they may still be alive?\u201d Mo Chaoge asked.\u201cVery likely.\u201d The Crescent Emissary said, \u201cMany warriors were killed in that region, and those not being killed had been scared out of the forest a long time ago. Therefore they can easily get out of the forest alive if they are not unlucky.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019d better be alive!\u201d Bernard from the Tush Mercenary Union was filled with hatred as he said coldly, \u201cThey will regret being in this world.\u201dA cold light flashed in the Crescent Emissary\u2019s eyes, as he said indifferently, \u201cI will take Mu Yu Die away.\u201d\u201cThen that skinny boy is mine. He stole something from my Mo Family, so I need to get it first. Then you can do whatever you want to him.\u201d Mo Chaoge took a glimpse at Bernard, and said in despise.Bernard kept silent, pondering on something that no one knew.\u2026Shi Yan was walking on the jagged stones cautiously, not daring to relax his vigilance.Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan were discussing something ahead of him. He couldn\u2019t hear them clearly.\u201cDing Yan.\u201d Mu Yu Die paused abruptly and turned around to look at him.\u201cYeah?\u201d Shi Yan was surprised and relaxed his vigilance a little, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cYou are from the Merchant Union?\u201d Mu Yu Die hesitated and then asked casually.\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cYou trained all by yourself?\u201d\u201cYup.\u201d\u201cYou helped me a lot all along the way, so I want to introduce you to someone. If he thinks highly of you, it will be very beneficial for your training. What do you think?\u201d Mu Yu Die was serious, as her beautiful eyes shone and gazed at him.Shi Yan was shocked at first, and after a long while, he shook his head and replied indifferently, \u201cMiss Mu, thank you for your kindness, but I don\u2019t like to be restrained.\u201dHe understood, Mu Yu Die wanted to introduce him to an influential person or to a certain power.In this world there were many single warriors who were at a very high level and could do whatever they wanted without any help.But most warriors would choose to attach themselves to a certain power or a big family.Those powers and families possessed lots of resources, immense Martial Skills and training materials, and most importantly, reputed warrior trainers, which could speed up one\u2019s training process and step into a higher level.However, those influential powers and families hardly admitted unknown warriors. It was very hard for a warrior to enter a big power without anyone\u2019s introduction.Apparently Mu Yu Die knew someone influential and she wanted to thank Shi Yan in that way.\u201cIt is very hard to train all by yourself.\u201d Mu Yu Die was a little shocked, as she couldn\u2019t understand Shi Yan. \u201cOne could gain rapid advancement only when he joins a strong power, and could get help at difficult times. A single warrior tends to be attacked in foreign areas. You understand that?\u201d\u201cYes, to train alone has many disadvantages. Die is very considerate. You still have the chance to reject after meeting that person.\u201d Di Yalan persuaded too.\u201cNope. I\u2019ll mind my own business, and I don\u2019t want to be anyone\u2019s domestic servant.\u201d Shi Yan shook his head firmly.\u201cThen whatever.\u201d Mu Yu Die frowned and felt that Shi Yan was being ungrateful, though she didn\u2019t insist.Di Yalan sighed, with a little bit of bitterness.She would go with Mu Yu Die, and since Shi Yan rejected Mu Yu Die\u2019s invitation, they would depart forever, for there was little chance they would meet again.In the past few days, Shi Yan had already walked into her heart. She was filled with sorrow at the thought of their departure.\u201cDing Yan, I must go with Die. You\u2026\u201dAfter a long thought, Di Yalan couldn\u2019t help but plead, as she looked at Shi Yan with regret.\u201cYou can go with me.\u201d Shi Yan was stunned, then added, \u201cIf you are willing to.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dDi Yalan looked gloomy as she murmured, \u201cThe power behind Die can not only protect Die, but also help me increase my ability. Furthermore, Die has promised me that I will get exorbitant training materials, as well as a weapon of the Soul Level, and will even have the opportunity to train with Spirit Level Martial Skills. I\u2026\u201d\u201cThen fine!\u201dShi Yan replied decidedly, \u201cYou have your own pursuits, so do I. And I can\u2019t give you what you want\u2026 Let\u2019s depart as soon as we get to Silent Town.\u201dObviously Di Yalan chose Mu Yu Die because she thought the power at Mu\u2019s back was more beneficial for her. And Mu Yu Die really gave her a high price, so she found it hard to refuse.\u201cDing Yan\u2026\u201d Di Yalan was heartbroken, \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to apologize.\u201d Shi Yan shook his head and replied indifferently, \u201cWe did everything at our own will. We don\u2019t owe each other.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Di Yalan was a little angry as she stared at Shi Yan with discontent. Her chest trembled, but then she uttered with a bitter sigh, \u201cHowever you think about it, I have my own plans. You are too young to understand that\u2026\u201dShi Yan curled his lips and looked at them coldly, not saying a word.\u201cYou just don\u2019t appreciate it.\u201d Mu Yu Die grunted.\u201cIf there isn\u2019t a common ground, a single word is a waste of breath.\u201d Shi Yan shook his head and walked onto another crossroad without taking a look at the two girls. His back to them, he said coldly, \u201cGoodbye forever.\u201d\u201cDing Yan!\u201d Di Yalan shouted, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say we wouldn\u2019t depart till we get to Silent Town?\u201d\u201cMiss Mu is at the Third Sky of Human Level, and there will be skillful warriors supporting you in the Woods. You don\u2019t need to worry anymore. I won\u2019t take advantage of that.\u201d Shi Yan\u2018s sound faded away gradually, and so did his figure.\u201cThis arrogant guy will get into trouble someday.\u201d Mu Yu Die shook her head, \u201cOne has to learn to yield sometimes in this world. Or it will be hard to survive, especially for us warriors.\u201dDi Yalan was so disappointed, \u201cI\u2019m so worried about him. Why not just go with us? Why did he refuse?\u201d\u201cNever mind. Stop worrying. We all will be in the Merchant Union, and will get the chance to meet again.\u201d Mu Yu Die comforted her, \u201cSister Lan, though we are women, we have a mission to make our family prosper and avenge Uncle Luo and our friends. We have to depend on a big power and complete our mission.\u201dAfter a short pause, some mixed emotions crossed her eyes. Mu Yu Die recalled the days when they were travelling with Shi Yan and that mind-blowing kiss with him in that cave\u2026But eventually, she shook her head firmly, seeming to get rid of Shi Yan\u2019s shadow in her mind. \u201cAnd him, just let him be a beautiful memory in our lives.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe seemed to say that to herself.\u201cHe is not that bad\u2026 almost Human Level\u2026 and he is so young\u2026\u201d Di Yalan mumbled.\u201cIt will take at least ten years for him to advance to Disaster or Earth Level, and even longer to get to Nirvana and Sky. We don\u2019t have that much time. Furthermore, he is on his own, without any strong support\u2026\u201d\u201cWell, fine.

Frowning slightly, she seemed to be deep in thought.A Mo Family escort with a plain and pimply face was standing next to her and was also deep in thought while narrowing his eyes.The sound of inconsistent heavy steps gradually came from afar.Mo Yanyu opened her eyes and fluttered her eyelashes. She glanced at Johnson, who was rapidly running towards her, and coldly reproached, \u201cWhy are you in such a hurry?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve spotted them!\u201d Johnson answered with a twisted face, \u201cTwo girls! According to the Star Emissary, that\u2019s who we want!\u201dMo Yanyu\u2019s adorable eyes suddenly lit up while her expression calmed down, \u201cIs the boy with them too?\u201d\u201cSeems not\u2026\u201d after a short pause, Johnson said calmly, \u201cWe will know where the boy is once we catch the girls.\u201d\u201cHad Third Uncle got this message?\u201d\u201cOne of our Star Emissaries had been sent for him.\u201d\u201cIn which direction?\u201d Mo Yanyu stood her beautiful body upright and stretched her limbs slowly, \u201cAre they further away from us or Third Uncle?\u201d\u201cFurther away from us. If everything goes well the Third Master and his people should arrive here soon.\u201d Johnson replied.\u201cWell then, let\u2019s not worry about it right now.\u201d Mo Yanyu frowned, as she talked to the pimply Mo Family escort next to her, \u201cUncle Li, do we need to go up there and meet them?\u201d\u201cNo hurry, our target hasn\u2019t shown up yet.\u201d Li Han smiled and shook his head, \u201cThird Master and the people from the Dark World are all there, so it will be fine. This pass is very crucial as well. We\u2019d better stay on high alert. Our goal is that boy. All our previous efforts will go to waste if that boy slips away.\u201d\u201cThat makes sense.\u201d Mo Yanyu nodded, without saying anything else.\u2026\u201cWooowoowoo! Woowoowoo!\u201dWhile stopping beside a snake-shaped rock, Mu Yu Die took out a silver horn and began to blow it.The sound of the horn rippled away like waves to far away places.Figures hiding in every corner of the Stone Woods came out one after another after they heard the horn, quickly rushing in the direction of Mu Yu Die.\u201cSister Lan, don\u2019t worry, some people will come to our rescue.\u201d Mu Yu Die smiled lightly, \u201cWe are really safe here. No need to worry about the Dark World.\u201d\u201cHopefully\u2026\u201d Di Yalan barely smiled. She couldn\u2019t settle down as she was worried about Shi Yan. She sighed, \u201cI hope he is fine\u2026\u201dShortly after, shadows appeared one after the other from far away. The man in the lead turned out to be the Crescent Emissary from the Dark World, and beside him were Mo Chaoge and Bernard, as well as several other Mo Family warriors and Star Emissaries.\u201cMiss Mu, nice to meet you again.\u201d The Crescent Emissary\u2019s vicious eyes were wandering over Mu Yu Die\u2019s body like a cunning snake. His voice was like ice, \u201cYou nearly managed a perfect escape! But too bad. Unfortunately for you, you didn\u2019t quite make it to the Merchant Union. You will instead be taken away by me.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d Mu Yu Die smiled calmly, showing no fear.The Crescent Emissary frowned and was confused. Mu Yu Die was too calm at this time. This was too abnormal.\u201cWhere is that young guy who was hanging around with you?\u201dMo Chaoge came over, glanced at the girls, and said coldly, \u201cTell me where the boy is! Or I will kill her first!\u201dMo Chaoge pointed at Di Yalan.\u201cShe is mine!\u201d Bernard angrily stared at Mo Chaoge, then flashed over to Di Yalan like lightning and stretched his hand towards her.\u201cTriing!\u201dNoise from a zither rang out suddenly. The sound was like a sharp weapon, lightly cutting into one\u2019s nerves.Bernard quivered and his face suddenly twisted in pain. He stepped back quickly and stared at Mu Yu Die in astonishment.Holding her zither, Mu Yu Die had already sat down. She looked at Bernard with a cold expression on her face, \u201cYou wanna try again?\u201dBernard\u2019s brain felt like it was being stabbed by a steel needle and he felt like his head was splitting. Hearing that, his face became even more distorted, but he didn\u2019t dare step up again.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201dThe Crescent Emissary\u2019s face twisted and showed panic for the first time, \u201cIt has only been a few weeks, your Music Martial Spirit shouldn\u2019t have recovered so soon!\u201dAfter a pause, he seemed to remember something and sneered, \u201cI know, you forced yourself to operate your broken veins! You are seeking death!\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d Mu Yu Die replied indifferently, \u201cMaybe you can give it a try? I know you have reached the Disaster Level. But if you could remember, you should know that I killed a Crescent Emissary at the same level as you with my Music Martial Spirit before we entered the Dark Forest.\u201dThis not only made the Crescent Emissary hesitate, but also made both Bernard and Mo Chaoge also panick. They stared at her with an unbelievable look in their eyes.\u201cEmissary? This\u2026 is it true?\u201d Mo Chaoge felt his mouth go dry and he took several steps back. He made a gesture to tell the Mo Family warriors not to take action.\u201cShe could do that if she is in a good condition\u2026 but now, I don\u2019t buy it.\u201d The Crescent Emissary grunted.\u201cHaha, Emissary, it\u2019s up to you.\u201d Mo Chaoge retracted further, and stood amongst the Mo Family warriors, showing that they were not going to take the initiative.\u201cWhoever comes up first, dies first.\u201d Mu Yu Die said coldly, and then turned her head away, not bothering to say anything more.Di Yalan was standing beside her on alert with a stoney face.Suddenly all was silent.Though suspicious, the Crescent Emissary didn\u2019t take action blindly.At the same time Bernard and Mo Chaoge quieted down after they heard that Mu Yu Die was capable of killing a Disaster Level Warrior. They made eye-contact with the Crescent Emissary to urge him to test Mu Yu Die.At that moment, shadows appeared from all directions from the surrounding rocks.A tall man suddenly stood beside Mu Yu Die and said softly, \u201cMiss Mu, how are you?\u201dEveryone in the area, including the Crescent Emissary, Mo Chaoge and Bernard, who were all Disaster Level warriors, couldn\u2019t figure out how he appeared.That man just appeared next to Mu Yu Die like a ghost.\u201cMartial Spirit of Teleportation! Beiming Family!\u201dMo Chaoge screamed in shock.\u201cLook who we have here\u2026 the Mo Family!\u201d The handsome young man beside Mu Yu Die looked around in arroganceand said coldly, \u201cHuh? You wanna fight with my Beiming Family?\u201d\u201cWe dare not.\u201dMo Chaoge took a deep breath and calmed down. He said to the young man politely, \u201cIt\u2019s the Third Young Master, no wonder Miss Mu was so confident. Third Young Master, I didn\u2019t know that Miss Mu was protected by the Beiming Family. If I knew that earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have bothered coming here. Please forgive me, Third Young Master\u2026\u201dBeiming Ce waved his hand and said impatiently, \u201cIf it\u2019s none of the Mo Family\u2019s business, just leave with your people. Don\u2019t get involved. I\u2019m gonna clean up the Dark World.\u201dAs he was talking, warriors wearing Beiming uniforms arrived one by one.Two old men, one thin and the other fat, stood next to him silently and fixed their cold eyes on Mo Chaoge and the Crescent Emissary separately.\u201cWell then, I will take my leave.\u201d Mo Chaoge smiled respectfully and left at once.The Mo Family warriors turned quiet after they saw Beiming Ce, and left immediately with Mo Chaoge.As for Bernard, he stepped back and was about to run away into the Stone Woods.Mu Yu Die touched her zither softly and said, \u201cThird Young Master, please kill that guy.\u201d\u201cTriing!\u201dThe sound of the zither rang out.Benard\u2019s body quivered heavily and he almost fell down. He jumpedbehind a rock immediately and ran as fast as hell.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cOld Yin, please.\u201d Beiming Ce ordered softly.The thin old man behind him suddenly rushed out like a ghost and, after a moment, disappeared.Three seconds later, Bernard\u2019s miserable horrifying scream came from within the Stone Woods.Five minutes later the thin old man, Old Yin, flew back like a ghost and stood still beside Beiming Ce, all without saying a word.Note from the TL: Hey guys, thank you for reading this excellent novel! And yeah, I know, though it\u2019s perfect, there\u2019s something funny\u2026such as the author sometime has bad memory that he forgets to make Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die call Shi Yan \u201cDing Yan\u201d, and the Pinyin \u201cDie\u201d is like the English word \u201cdie\u201d\u2026haha, anyway, it IS an intriguing novel, isn\u2019t it?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Seeing confusion in the Crescent Emissary\u2019s eyes, she said, \u201cYou never thought you would encounter misfortune after such a long chase, did you?\u201d\u201cBeiming Ce! This is a matter between the Dark World and the Mu Family. Your Beiming Family better not get involved!\u201d The Crescent Emissary didn\u2019t look at Mu Yu Die, but instead stared at Beiming Ce. \u201cAs long as you allow me to take Miss Mu away, the Lord of the Dark World will reward your Beiming Family with anything you want.\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Beiming Ce shook his head and said calmly, \u201cSince you\u2019re already here, there is no reason for you to return.\u201dThe two old men behind him quickly flew out again.These two old men flew towards the emissaries like hideous devils. After a few seconds, all the emissaries from the Dark World, including the Crescent Emissary, had their chests sliced open and died instantly.Once all the emissaries were killed, the two frightening old men silently flew back to Beiming Ce\u2019s side like two ghostly shadows.Standing beside Mu Yu Die, Di Yalan was astonished when she saw the miserable deaths of the emissaries.She knew that the Beiming Family was very influential within the Merchant Union, but she never thought they were this powerful!The Beiming Family didn\u2019t care about retaliation from the Dark World. Therefore, they ruthlessly killed the emissaries.\u201cSister Lan, do you still think we made the wrong decision?\u201d Mu Yu Die smiled.Di Yalan had a complicated expression on her face. She lightly sighed, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d\u201cStop worrying. For our future\u2019s sake, it\u2019s best to forget about him as soon as possible.\u201d Mu Yu Die persuaded her softly.\u201cOk.\u201d Di Yalan nodded helplessly.\u201cShall we go now?\u201d Beiming Ce\u2019s black eyes wandered over Di Yalan and Mu Yu Die for a while as he asked politely.\u201cSure.\u201d\u2026In another region of the Stone Woods.As Shi Yan stepped around a corner, he suddenly drew back while on alert.\u201cShoo!\u201dA sharp arrow landed in front of him. At the same time, a Blue Smoke Bomb of the Mo Family shot up into the sky.\u201cHum! It\u2019s you again! Reckless!\u201d Shi Yan grunted with a stony face.Mo Yanyu appeared from within a stone cave with arrows in her hand. She looked at Shi Yan and said coldly , \u201cYou\u2019ve finally shown up!\u201dJohnson, with his broken arm, and Li Han also appeared from behind her and blocked Shi Yan from both sides,while watching him cautiously.\u201cYou are seeking death!\u201dShi Yan shouted and suddenly shot towards Mo Yanyu like a sharp sword.While shooting forward, his body was covered with white smoke and the smell of death. He looked like a terrifying devil!\u201cMiss! Watch out!\u201d Li Han cried out in fear and flew towards Mo Yanyu like lightning.Li Han was at the Second Sky of Human Level, thus he could see Shi Yan\u2019s amazing explosiveness! How could Mo Yanyu bear such violent force!\u201cCheechee!\u201dShi Yan slammed his foot down and cut a long gouge in the ground. Suddenly, his body changed direction and rushed towards Johnson, moving faster than before.\u201cBang!\u201dBefore Johnson could even think, he saw a white shadow rushing towards him and an overwhelming power slammed into his body.\u201cKakaka!\u201dAll of Johnson\u2019s bones broke instantly and blood poured from his mouth and eyes. He fell to the ground and moaned miserably.\u201cYou are Johnson, right? You certainly enjoyed it when you whipped me hard a few days ago!\u201d Standing beside Johnson, Shi Yan kicked on Johnson\u2019s chest again and again. He smirked, \u201cAre you enjoying this now? Huh?\u201dShi Yan continued to kick Johnson until a broken bone in his chest was forced into his heart and he finally ceased to breathe.\u201cBrutal!\u201d Li Han was shocked. Though he wanted to go and kill Shi Yan, he worried about Mo Yanyu, so he could only hesitate and shout, unable to stop him.Mo Yanyu was horrified. She was dumbstruck after she saw how brutally Johnson was killed.Johnson\u2019s Profound Qi was then quickly absorbed into Shi Yan\u2019s meridians in a few seconds.Shi Yan turned around and fixed his bright eyes on Mo Yanyu; then he smiled coldly, \u201cPretty, we will meet again. And believe me, you will regret what you have done to me.\u201dAs he finished his sentence, he slipped around a nearby stone and disappeared into the Stone Woods.\u201cOld Li, why didn\u2019t you kill him!\u201d Mo Yanyu said angrily after Shi Yan disappeared.\u201cThat guy is at least at the Second Sky of Nascent Level. Also, he used such brutal martial arts that could kill in a single move. He moved so fast that I could hardly follow him. If I had moved, he would have come and attacked you, so I was afraid\u2026\u201d Li Han said apologetically.\u201cSecond Sky of Nascent Level!\u201dMo Yanyu held her breath as fear could be seen in her eyes. She mumbled, \u201cIt\u2019s impossible! There was only a little Profound Qi in his body two months ago! He was merely at the First Sky of Elementary Level!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Li Han\u2019s whole body shook as he looked at her unbelievably. After a long time, he continued, \u201cIf that\u2019s true, Miss, in my humble opinion, you have caused a huge problem for the Mo Family.\u201d\u2026Shi Yan moved quickly through the Stone Woods, not spending one more second than necessary in any area.He knew that Li Han was a Human Level warrior, and since the Blue Smoke Bomb of the Mo Family was already in the sky, more people would gather there shortly. He had to escape as soon as possible to avoid any further trouble.Because of his cautiousness, he managed to escape from that dangerous region before Mo Chaoge and his people arrived.There didn\u2019t seem to be many warriors hiding in the Stone Woods. He didn\u2019t see anyone while he was fleeing, which confused him a little. He guessed this abnormality had something to do with those influential people Mu Yu Die mentioned.\u2026At nightfall.Shi Yan finally got out of the Stone Woods and was walking towards Silent Town, which was only a very short distance away.He slowed down a little and began to sort through the memories of the previous owner of his body to recall everything he could about the Shi Family.He needed the identity of the former master of this body.As one of the five biggest families in the Merchant Union, the Shi Family was rich in all types of resources such as Martial Skills, a Gravity Field training room, rare Chinese medicines and skillful warrior trainers\u2026He needed to use these advantages to strengthen himself.He had decided when he was at the blood pool that he would go to the Shi Family, and that\u2019s why he refused Mu Yu Die\u2019s offer.The identity of his body was too special that it would cause a lot of trouble if he attached himself to another power.In addition, a new power wouldn\u2019t give him access to the best resources.But it would be totally different if he went to the Shi Family\u2026The previous master of his body was the young master of the Shi Family. As long as he showed talent, the Shi Family would cultivate him at any cost.It would be a total waste if he didn\u2019t take advantage of their special resources.\u2026Once he reached Silent Town, he walked directly into a shop which was collecting all sort of stones without a second thought and shouted naturally, \u201cAnyone here?\u201dAn attendant came up with a wide smile, and flattered, \u201cYoung Master Yan, you\u2019ve finally returned! The Master sent Minister Han to pick you up long ago since you disappeared in the Dark Forest. Young Master Yan, Minister Han is in the backyard, for he has waited for you for many days. But now, it is a little inconvenient for him to meet. Could you wait for a moment\u2026?\u201dThe attendant looked towards the backyard with ambiguous eyes.\u201cNever mind. I know what he is doing.\u201d Shi Yan walked directly into the backyard of the shop.Several Shi Family warriors were gambling in the backyard. At the sight of Shi Yan, they panicked and put the dices away embarrassingly, then greeted loudly, \u201cYoung Master Yan!\u201d\u201cPlease go on.\u201d Shi Yan waved his hands and strode past them to the back room.These warriors were quite surprised since Shi Yan left without scolding them.\u201cWhat? He didn\u2019t reproach us this time. Too strange!\u201d\u201cYes. He used to scold us every time he saw us gambling. Do some actual work! Stop goofing around! How strange that he didn\u2019t say anything this time!\u201d\u201cYoung Master Yan looked totally different. It seems\u2026 that he has developed some manliness. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\u201cWell, yeah, you have a point.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dShi Yan opened the door as he reached the back room and walked in directly, \u201cUncle Han, when did you arrive here?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHan Zhong was quite shocked. After dressing himself in a hurry, he smiled in embarrassment, \u201c\u2026 Young Master Yan, when did you come in?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been here for quite a while.\u201d Shi Yan smiled, sipped his tea, and waved his hand, \u201cIt\u2019s ok. If you are not satisfied enough you can keep going. Besides, I have the chance to learn something from you.\u201d\u201cKekeke!\u201d Han Zhong coughed strongly for a while, \u201cSatisfied, satisfied. Well, Xiao Feng Xian, you should go back to your business.\u201d\u201cOk, I will take my leave.\u201d That young woman dressed herself in bed and then stepped down with a red face. As she walked to the doorway, she suddenly turned back and glared at Shi Yan\uff0c\u201cEverybody said Young Master Yan from the Shi Family is a righteous man, I guess they are all blind! I\u2019ve never seen such a \u2018righteous\u2019 man before! Humph!\u201dShe giggled and leered at Shi Yan, before moving her hot body out of the room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In order to protect me, they all sacrificed themselves.\u201dHan Zhong was rather shocked as he looked at Shi Yan in confusion, \u201cI was more or less aware of the situation. It\u2019s so lucky of you to have escaped from it.\u201dHe had heard the news long ago that the Silver Thunder Wolf had gone on a rampage, so he planned to go back to Shi Family in half a month since he assumed that he wouldn\u2019t be able to find Shi Yan alive. He couldn\u2019t believe that Shi Yan walked out of the Dark Forest unscathced.It was so intense in the Dark Forest that even experienced warriors had been killed. But Shi Yan, who was a nerd, had somehow managed to survive. This completely surprised Han Zhong.Han Zhong didn\u2019t really like the former master of Shi Yan\u2019s body.That guy didn\u2019t train in martial arts and was very old-fashioned; he loved to look into things that no one else in the Shi Family liked. Han Zhong couldn\u2019t understand that.Now, if it weren\u2019t for Shi Jian\u2019s order and the fact that he happened to be in Silent Town, he wouldn\u2019t have been here waiting for Shi Yan.\u201cYes, you certainly did have good luck.\u201dShi Yan nodded as he smiled naturally, then he asked indifferently, \u201cUncle Han, when are we returning home?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s up to you, Young Master Yan. Actually I\u2019m desperate to leave, for I have something to report to the family head. I would have returned days ago if it weren\u2019t for you.\u201d Han Zhong paused and answered boldly.While he was talking, Han Zhong couldn\u2019t help but begin to examine Shi Yan. He didn\u2019t notice it at first, but after a careful examination, he realized something was different about him\u2026Shi Yan was much skinnier than before, and his round face had become angular and more masculine.Sitting there naturally, Shi Yan\u2019s kept his back upright and his body was like a sharp sword which made him seem quite hard-edged.That wasn\u2019t the only change in his appearance.The former Shi Yan only lit up when he was researching historic relics. He was often listless on an average day.But now, the guy before Han Zhong had deep bright eyes and seemed to be deep in thought all the time, sending out the impression that he knew everything.\u201cUncle Han, may I ask you something?\u201d Under Han Zhong\u2019s gaze, Shi Yan continued easily, \u201cIt is surprisingly quiet in the Stone Woods these days, do you know what\u2019s happening?\u201d\u201cWell, the Beiming Family sent people there. It is said that they were meeting someone in the Stone Woods, therefore the warriors who were wandering in the Stone Woods all left upon hearing that.\u201d\u201cThe Beiming Family! Who was in the lead?\u201d Shi Yan realized something.\u201cBeiming Ce.\u201dHan Zhong began to curse after he answered Shi Yan, \u201cThat guy is said to have reached Disaster Level half a year ago. Damn! He is only twenty seven years old! And he has twin Martial Spirits! Madness! I\u2019m already forty five and still at The Second Sky of Disaster Level! It\u2019s unfair!\u201dTwenty five years old, First Sky of Disaster Level, twin Martial Spirits\u2026Shi Yan stiffened as he suddenly realized that Beiming Ce was the person Mu Yu Die had planned to introduce him to.That man has a rare talent and reached that level at such a young age. In addition, he came from the number one family in the Merchant Union \u2013 the Beiming Family. No wonder Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan chose him.Silently, Shi Yan smirked to himself and an icy glint could be seen in his eyes: twenty five years old, Disaster Level, twin Martial Spirits, that\u2019s very unbelievable?Not exactly!He was someone who had reached The Third Sky of Nascent Level from the First Sky of Elementary Level in mere two months!Despite the Petrification and Immortal Martial Spirits, he also possessed another vicious and mysterious Martial Spirit. In comparison, he had much more potential than Beiming Ce!\u201cTime! I only need some time to surpass Beiming Ce!\u201d Shi Yan thought to himself.\u201cYoung Master Yan, you, you\u2019ve got Profound Qi in your body?\u201dHan Zhong\u2019s eyes lit up and he gazed at Shi Yan seriously, \u201cI can feel that there is Profound Qi flowing in your body, and it is incredibly dense! Young Master Yan, what on earth happened to you?\u201dShi Yan took a deep breath, trying to suppress his indignation, \u201cYes, I\u2019ve got Profound Qi, so I\u2019m a warrior now.\u201d\u201cWhich Level?\u201d Han Zhong couldn\u2019t wait.\u201cNascent Level.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d\u2026The Merchant Union. Tianyun City. The Shi Family. The training field.The training field of Shi Family extended tens of miles and was covered with ancient trees and odd rocks\u2026There were also water pools, sand fields, earth fields and wooden rooms within the training field\u2026With complicated refuges and barriers everywhere\uff0cthe members of Shi Family were able to conduct live combat exercises.And they could also learn to adjust and fight in all sorts of topographies.At the time being, in the center of the training field, stood a huge, diamond shaped testing jade. The third generation of Shi Family were in a queue, walking towards the jade. They put their hand on the testing jade and sent out Profound Qi to test their level.\u201cShi Tianluo, twenty-one, the Second Sky of Nascent Level!\u201d\u201cShi Tianxiao, twenty-five, the First Sky of Nascent Level!\u201d\u201cShi Tianling, twenty-seven, the Third Sky of Elementary Level!\u201d\u201cShi Tianke, twenty, the Second Sky of Nascent Level!\u201d\u201cShi Tianyun, nineteen, the Third Sky of Nascent Level!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHan Feng, who was standing beside the testing jade with his eyes narrowed, yelled out after every young member finished his test.Everytime Han Feng announced the result, the members of the first and second generations changed their expression accordingly; either happy or disappointed.\u201cSecond Brother, your Tianyun is really something! He managed to advance to a higher stage!\u201d Shi Kuo was a little angry as he grunted, \u201cTianke has been too lazy recently! I have to do something!\u201d\u201cThird Brother, Tianke trains really hard. I saw him training in the Gravitational Room at midnight. Don\u2019t pressure him too much, or it could go the opposite way.\u201d Shi Gang comforted him.\u201cTianyun, work harder. Advance to Human Level as soon as possible.\u201d Shi Tie\u2019s sound was like a great bell as he said proudly.Shi Tie was Shi Jian\u2019s brother, and Shi Gang and Shi Kuo were his sons. Shi Tianyun was Shi Gang\u2019s son and thus Shi Tie\u2019s grandson. Shi Tie was delighted as he saw that Shi Tianyun had advanced.The position of family head was decided by one\u2019s Martial level. Many years ago Shi Tie lost to his brother, so he was rather unhappy and hoped that his grandson, Shi Tianyun, could transcend Shi Jian\u2019s grandson, Shi Tianxiao.The Petrification Martial Spirit was very special and only went to the first two children of a couple.The third child would rarely have the chance to inherit it.That\u2019s why every small family of Shi would generally only have two children.Even the head of the Shi Family, Shi Jian, only had two children: Shi Yang and Shi Qing.Shi Yang had a daughter \u2013 Shi Tianling, and a son \u2013 Shi Tianxiao.Shi Qing and Yang Hai only had one son and that was Shi Yan.Thus, Shi Tianling, Shi Tianxiao and Shi Yan were Shi Jian\u2019s grandchildren, while Shi Tianyun, Shi Tianluo and Shi Tianke were Shi Tie\u2019s grandchildren.The members of Shi Family all got along well with each other. They stuck together and worked hard to increase the influence of their family.But no matter how close they were, they still competed with each other. Such as Shi Tie, he always wanted to surpass Shi Jian through his grandson.As his sons, Shi Gang and Shi Kuo, were not comparable to Shi Jian\u2019s son, Shi Yang, he had given up passing his dream onto them.Luckily, his grandsons, Shi Tianyun and Shi Tianke, were more talented than Shi Tianxiao. He was rather proud every time they did the test, although it was without any bad intentions.Yang Hai was standing next to Shi Yang, as he was explaining the state of their quarry to the latter. Hearing Shi Tie\u2019s yell, Shi Yang got serious, \u201cWell, second uncle is about to show off again.\u201d After a pause, he glanced at Shi Tianxiao who was standing beside him and scolded, \u201cYou little bastard! You only cause me to lose face!\u201d\u201cEr\u2026I\u2019m not that bad\u2026\u201d Shi Tianxiao drew his head back and looked miserable.Yang Hai\u2019s face became bitter as he sighed, \u201cYou should be satisfied. Think about my Shi Yan. At least Tianxiao is a warrior. But that bastard fools around all day and hasn\u2019t come back yet. Who knows how much trouble he will bring back this time.\u201d\u201cHa, that\u2019s true.\u201d Shi Yang laughed.\u2026The descendants of Shi Family were all gathered together on the training field and were discussing lively.Just then, an eagle appeared in the sky and settled down on Shi Jian\u2019s shoulder.Shi Jian picked up a little gray bag from the eagle\u2019s claw and took out a letter. Opening the letter casually, he began to read and he frowned.They were all his relatives, so he didn\u2019t intend to hide anything.\u201cHuh?\u201dAfter merely one glance, Shi Jian couldn\u2019t help but cry out with an amazed look on his face.The people on the field were surprised and became quiet. They looked at Shi Jian and wondered why he was acting so weird.\u201cBig Brother, what\u2019s up?\u201d Shi Tie frowned and asked loudly, \u201cIs the Mo Family making a fuss again? Damn! They won\u2019t quiet down if we don\u2019t give them a good kick!\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Shi Jian put down the letter excitedly as he said in surprise, \u201cHan Zhong found Shi Yan!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHow is that bastard?\u201d Upon hearing that, Yang Hai finally settled down. He asked with an annoyed face, seemingly planning on giving Shi Yan a lesson when he returned.\u201cThat kid, is a warrior now\u2026\u201d Shi Jian looked shocked as his mouth trembled. He was trying to hide his excitement.\u201cWhat?\u201d Shi Tie couldn\u2019t help but cry out, \u201cHe is seventeen! Why did he begin to train at such an old age!\u201dAfter thinking, he sighed lightly as he really felt sorry for Shi Yan, \u201cIt\u2019s too late, starting at seventeen. I guess he won\u2019t achieve anything in his life. What was that little bastard doing before now! If he had been training since he was born, he could have reached the Second or Third Sky of Nascent Level, even if he doesn\u2019t possesses the Martial Spirit of Shi Family.\u201d\u201cThat kid, is now at the Third Sky of Nascent Level!\u201d Shi Jian answered firmly with sharp eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A ground dragon was carrying the goods they had purchased from Silent Town.Shi Yan and Han Zhong were at the head of the troop and had talked all the way.\u201cOld Han, it\u2019s getting late. Let\u2019s continue for home tomorrow. We should rest somewhere in the city today, okay?\u201d Shi Yan said leisurely.\u201cWell, where does Brother Yan want to stay?\u201d Han Zhong smiled with an ambiguous look on his face, \u201cTianyun City is the biggest city in the Merchant Union, with a large population of several millions. The recreation centers in this city are much better quality than those in the small cities we passed.\u201d\u201cWell Old Han, since you are familiar with this area, you lead the way. \u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid my remaining crystal coins are not enough. Hmm, we will spend cost a lot at some places.\u201d\u201cOld Han, you want to take advantage of me again? Last time in the Scent Pavilion you pretended to be drunk and made me pay for everything.

I work so hard for the family and earn so little money that I can barely even afford my recreation time\u2026\u201d\u201cDeal! It\u2019s your treat tonight.\u201d Shi Yan looked back and shouted to the warriors behind him, \u201cFellows, you all heard that right?\u201d\u201cYes, we heard it!\u201dAll seven warriors of Shi Family yelled excitedly at the same time.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d\u2026Shi Yan mingled well with Han Zhong and those warriors in that half a month.Shi Yan was not pretentious at all as he ate and interacted happily with the warriors. And he was very open when it came to women, for he never chickened out in brothels, sometimes being even more audacious and horny than Han Zhong once he met a lovely girl.The two of them went to a lot of brothels together along the way. They paid in turns and never let the warriors use any money.In a very short time, Shi Yan won the trust of Han Zhong and his escorts.Han Zhong thought they shared the same interests and complimented Shi Yan on the fact that he had grown up. As his level increased, Shi Yan had become a totally different person.Shi Yan concealed most of what had happened to him in the Dark Forest. He told Han Zhong that he found a certain type of red fruit in the ancient cave he was studying. After eating three such fruits, he got Profound Qi and awoke the Petrification Martial Spirit of Shi Family.He didn\u2019t mention a word about the blood pool, the Immortal Martial Spirit or the mysterious Martial Spirit, nor the story between him and Mo Yanyu and Mu Yu Die.Though Han Zhong was very surprised by Shi Yan\u2019s magical story, he didn\u2019t keep asking, but thought that Shi Yan was incredibly lucky to find that fruit which made him stronger.And during these days, Shi Yan learnt all he could about the Shi Family through Han Zhong.The former master of his body had left him many memories, though it was mostly about the historic relics and ancient language that he had studied.But Shi Yan couldn\u2019t recall many memories about the Shi Family. Luckily Han Zhong was not on guard against him. During their together time in brothels, Han Zhong had already told him all he wanted to know.After hanging out together several times, Han Zhong began to like this young master; so he told Shi Yan not only about the business and power distribution of Shi Family , but also common sense about martial training, which Shi Yan wasn\u2019t aware of before.For example, when a warrior reached Nirvana Level, the Conception Sea would form in their mind, which could connect and combine the Martial Spirit magically with their Profound Qi to activate a secret skill and release an amazing power.Also, he told Shi Yan a lot about the features and weakness of all sorts of Martial Spirits; about the most powerful Martial Spirit in the Merchant Union, the Fire Empire and the God-blessed Empire, and tjheir weaknesses and disadvantages.Although Han Zhong was very lustful, he was quite diligent in training Martial Arts.Han Zhong possessed a lot information about warriors, therefore, through him, Shi Yan gained a thorough and comprehensive understanding about warriors, as well as the differences among the Levels below Disaster Level.Han Zhong was a Disaster Level warrior, so he couldn\u2019t tell Shi Yan much about the levels above it, but he told Shi Yan everything he knew about the lower levels.This information was exactly what Shi Yan needed most right now.\u2026The Dream Pavilion.Shi Yan and Han Zhong, along with four Shi family warriors, were drinking and having fun in a large room on the third floor.In the center of the simple and unsophisticated room, on some soft carpet, stood a one-meter high square table, which was loaded with delicate food and drinks.Shi Yan and Han Zhong were sitting on the carpet with hot young girls in their arms, yelling and playing dice happily.\u201cOld Han, drink!\u201d Shi Yan yelled.Han Zhong was downcast as he had lost numerous times. He drank up the wine in his cup at once and rubbed the girl\u2019s in his arms breasts. Then he raised the dice and grunted, \u201cThis hand\u2019s got some luck, this time I will definitely win!\u201d\u201cAww, if that is luck, both of my hands have it!\u201d Shi Yan\u2019s grin widened and he put both of his hands underneath the girl\u2019s coat, \u201cQiu Xiang, you really got big things here, say, I will always be bigger than him!\u201dQiu Xiang had delicate white skin and plump breasts. Her watery eyes were filled with shyness, \u201cYoung Master Yan, you are so bad! Why do you tease me all the time?\u201d\u201cYou can tease me too.\u201d Shi Yan smiled, drank his strong drink, and urged, \u201cOld Han, what are you waiting for? Cast the dice!\u201d\u201cYin Kui and Jiu Shan are nearby. Too much Yin Qi is coming forth. I can feel it clearly.\u201d Han Zhong frowned, released the girl in his arms, and quietly walked to the window.He opened the window and looked out of it with the help of the light of a big red lantern, \u201cSure enough, there is Beiming Ce. Yin Kui and Jiu Shan never leave his side. Wherever Yin Kui and Jiu Shan are, you will find Beiming Ce.\u201dAs Han Zhong mentioned Beiming Ce, Shi Yan suddenly remembered Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan.After a little hesitation, he too walked to the window and opened it a little wider, coldly gazing at the troop on the street.This troop consisted of around thirty people. Beiming Ce was riding on his snow white Ling Xiao Horse at the head of the troop. Smiling lightly, he was talking to someone in the sedan on a ground dragon beside him.As the curtain on the sedan fluttered in the wind, Mu Yu Die\u2019s fairy-like face could be seen.Di Yalan was riding a war horse with black armor on it, her hot body moving up and down with the pace of the war horse. She looked in low-spirits and a slight, sorrowful frown could be seen between her eyebrows.She barely smiled when Beiming Ce talked to her, not showing too much interest.The two old men, who were sending out heavy Yin Qi, were both riding black-armored war horses behind Beiming Ce silently.Shi Yan opened the window a little more. When he looked at the troop who were still dozens of meters away, the two old men seemed to notice as they looked in his direction immediately.Shi Yan felt two streams of cold Yin Qi gush out of their eyes from so far away, making him shudder with fear.The two old men seemed to know Han Zhong, as when they came near the window and saw him, their cold air decreased.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euUnder the two men\u2019s gaze, Han Zhong became a totally different person. Instead of behaving in a noisy, flamboyant and boisterous manner, he looked rigid, as he gave a salute to them, holding his fists in front of his chest.The two old men nodded and didn\u2019t look at Han Zhong anymore. They turned back and narrowed their eyes, focusing again towards Beiming Ce\u2019s back.The troop from the Beiming Family didn\u2019t stop, but continued their leisurely steps along the street.There were several warriors who were out seeking fun on the narrow street. They stepped to the side of the road in respect when they saw the Beiming troop.A small path was thus suddenly formed in the middle of the crowded street for the Beiming troops to move by smoothly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He stood stunned at the window for quite a while before closing the window.Going back to his seat, he was in rather low-spirits. He merely focused on drinking and didn\u2019t put his hands on the girls anymore.\u201cYoung Master Yan, was that the Beiming Family troop?\u201d Karl, a Shi Family warrior, asked him casually.\u201cYes.\u201d Shi Yan answered bluntly and kept drinking.Standing by the window, Shi Zhong looked at Shi Yan, frowning with an odd look in his eyes. After some hesitation, he asked, \u201cBrother Yan, the woman on the war horse, you\u2026 do you know her?\u201dShi Yan nodded and finished the wine in his cup, \u201cYes, we walked out of the Dark Forest together. As you heard, the demon beasts were everywhere. It was better to be accompanied than be alone.\u201dHan Zhong was an experienced man. Seeing Shi Yan\u2019s apathetic response, he blinked his eyes and assumed that something must have happened between Shi Yan and Di Yalan.Moving near Shi Yan, Han Zhong waved his hand to the girl next to him, \u201cLeave us alone. We need to talk.\u201dThe foxy girls stood up smiling and quickly left the room.When there were only the warriors left in the room, Han Zhong said, \u201cBrother Yan, I don\u2019t know who that woman is. But it seems that Beiming Ce is quite into her. If she accepts Beiming Ce as well, you should forget her.\u201d\u201cHan Zhong is right. There are so many women in the world. It\u2019s unwise to offend Beiming Ce for a woman. The Beiming Family is the number one family in the Merchant Union, and they are too influential. Beiming Ce is Beiming Shang\u2019s beloved son. It\u2019s unwise to offend him.\u201d Karl reminded Shi Yan earnestly.Karl, who was at the Second Sky of Nascent Level, was the leader of the warriors. He tried to comfort Shi Yan as the latter had left a very good impression.\u201cOld Han, who were those two old men?\u201d Shi Yan didn\u2019t reply to Karl\u2019s statement, but looked to Han Zhong.\u201cYin Kui and Jiu Shan have the same teacher, and they are at the First Sky of Nirvana Level now, but no one knows where they came from. They used to serve the family head of Beiming Family, Beiming Shang. After Beiming Ce was born, and considering how he possesses twin Martial Spirits and agile movements, Beiming Shang assigned them to protect Beiming Ce.\u201dThe First Sky of Nirvana Level! Shi Yan was astounded.Shi Jian, the family head of the Shi Family, was only at the Third Sky of Nirvana Level.There were millions of residents in the Merchant Union, among which were numerous warriors who trained Martial Arts. But only a small part of them, barely more than ten people, could step into the Nirvana Level.The two Nirvana-Level warriors stayed by Beiming Ce\u2019s side without doing anything else. The world was his oyster.\u201cIn the Merchant Union, the Beiming Family is much more powerful than the other two biggest families combined. There are many skillful warriors among the Ministers, and talented descents pop up now and then. Plus, Beiming Shang himself is at the Sky Level. It is really unwise to offend the Beiming Family.\u201dSeeing that Shi Yan wasn\u2019t responding, Han Zhong hastily explained in case Shi Yan acted abruptly.\u201cOk, got it.\u201d After being silent for a while, Shi Yan nodded. His expression turned back to normal as he smiled to Han Zhong, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Old Han. I know what to do and when to endure.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good for you.\u201d Han Zhong said feeling relieved, \u201cLet the girls in again?\u201d\u201cNo. Not interested. Let\u2019s drink.\u201d\u201cGreat! Let\u2019s drink! Come on!\u201d\u2026The Merchant Union was a very special country which was co-governed by the big families, warriors, mercenaries, merchants and all sorts of NGOs.There were no formal army, no officers, and no governmental structure.Instead, there were many big families, hundreds of mercenary unions, tens of thousands of merchants, vagrants and civilians who hated wars\u2026The Merchant Union never got involved in the wars between the Fire Empire and the God-blessed Empire, therefore it was a peaceful country.However, once it was invaded, all the forces in the Merchant Union would unite to fight against the enemy.Over the history of the Merchant Union, the Fire Empire and the God-blessed Empire had both attempted to invade it for its wealth, but they were smashed every time by the united army of the big families and mercenary unions in the Merchant Union.On average days, there were no governors in the Merchant Union, but once it was in danger, its people would fight together to drive back their mutual enemy.Those big families, hundreds of mercenary unions and wealthy merchants could form an extremely powerful force which could defeat the God-blessed Empire and the Fire Empire easily.It\u2019s lucky that the forces in the Merchant Union only came together when the country was in danger, or it could swallow any other country at any time!The Merchant Union was in a crucial position. The Dark Forest was to its south, the Dead Swamp to its north, continuous Cloud Mountain to its west and the enormous Endless Sea to its east.No matter if it was the Dead Swamp, the Cloud Mountain, or the islands in the Endless Sea, there hid all kinds of abundant resources, such as minerals and magical medicines. As a big trading nation, the Merchant Union took advantage of its geographical location.However, despite the exuberant resources in the Dead Swamp, the Cloud Mountain and the Endless Sea, there was also incredible danger.Demon beasts, poisonous fog, miasma, hideous tribes, and disasters\u2026That\u2019s why one needed to be very capable to travel in these areas. Luckily, the Merchant Union never lacked skillful mercenary unions and warriors.There were seventeen cities in the Merchant Union, and the Tianyun City was the biggest among them.Tianyun City was located in the center of the Merchant Union, with eight small cities around it. It covered a large area which almost equaled the eight small cities combined, as did its population.Therefore, Tianyun City was like the capital city of the Merchant Union, which was the main territory of those biggest families.The Shi Family was amongst them. Though they had properties and gardens in every main city, the Shi Family was rooted in Tianyun City.The Shi Family was located in the northern part of Tianyun City. It covered one hundred miles and had thousands of buildings in it. Artificial lakes, rockeries, gardens and brooks were everywhere. The Shi Family descendants lived in the serene back garden, where there was an artificial lake in the middle, with beautiful pavilions surrounding it. Behind the pavilions were the training fields, gravitational rooms, and suffering palaces\u2026There were not many direct Shi descendants, but its branches and ministers could easily reach one hundred. Considering those servants and escorts, there were almost one thousand people in Shi Family.Early every morning, the Shi Family members, ministers and warriors would train hard in within the training grounds.On that day, just as the rooster crowed and the sky began to turn bright, many warriors had already gotten up and started to train.Shi Jian walked out of the Rock Room and shouted below into Yang Hai\u2019s pavilion. Then they walked toward the gate together.During their walk to the gate, the warriors bowed to them. Shi Jian nodded indifferently without slowing his steps.A short time after they reached the gate, Han Feng appeared behind them. He began to observe the corridor out the gate as he stood next to Shi Jian silently.\u201cAccording to Han Zhong\u2019s message, they should have arrived home last night. Since they didn\u2019t, they must arrive today.\u201d Shi Jian frowned and mumbled, \u201cI waited till dawn to see if that boy has really reached the Third Sky of Nascent Level. But that bastard didn\u2019t come home\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe they were held up by something on the road.\u201d Though Yang Hai was cursing in his mind that Shi Yan was too impolite, he still explained for him.\u201cDammit. Is it possible that Han Zhong sent the wrong message?\u201dShi Jian looked back to Han Feng in confusion, \u201cI have met someone whose Martial Spirit awoke as a teenager, so I\u2019m not skeptical about that. However, that kid has never trained in martial arts before turning seventeen, but now he is suddenly at the Third Sky of Nascent level, that is just unbelievable! I have been pondering upon it for several nights but I still can\u2019t figure it out. What do you think?\u201dHan Feng pouted, narrowed his eyes and said, \u201cThough Han Zhong is not a serious man most of the time, he is quite cautious on major things, so I don\u2019t think he would dare to lie about this. I can\u2019t explain it either, but I think it might be true.\u201d\u201cWell, I can only hope so. That bastard has let me down these past seventeen years, I hope this time he will be different.\u201dMany warriors came out after them in curiosity after they had breakfast, as they heard that the family head was waiting at the gate. They gathered together and were discussing boisterously.No one knew who was coming. The most likely people were those of the Beiming Family or Zuo Family, or Shi Jian wouldn\u2019t be there.Yet, after a long long time, no one showed up. The warriors turned impatient and began to curse amongst themselves at the arrogant person who had made Shi Jian wait for so long.As the sun rose higher and higher, they still saw nothing. Shi Jian was becoming worried as well, as he said to Yang Hai next to him, \u201cIt\u2019s been so long. What happened?\u201dYang Hai shook his head with a bitter smile implying he didn\u2019t know either, while he sighed secretly to himself.Though Shi Jian mentioned Shi Yan now and then, he never really cared for him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe remembered Shi Yan only after Yang Hai\u2019s reminder that Shi Yan had disappeared in the Dark Forest.Upon hearing Shi Yan had reached the Third Sky of Nascent Level, Shi Jian asked about him every day, and even came out early and waited for him\u2026Shi Jian\u2019s attitude switched too much, which made Yang Hai a little uncomfortable.Hours later, it was approaching noon as the sun was directly above them in the sky., a fat ground dragon slowly appeared from the corridor.Two persons were leisurely leading while chatting happily. They were Shi Yan and Han Zhong.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were totally surprised.Yang Hai didn\u2019t train martial arts, so he didn\u2019t know that one getting skinnier didn\u2019t necessarily imply weakness.Sometimes there was much more explosiveness hidden in a skinny body, than in a robust one.However, Shi Jian and Han Feng were both experts, therefore they realized just from a glance that Shi Yan had become much stronger, and was even stronger than those third generation descents who had trained hard for more than ten years.They looked at each other and were amazed.They couldn\u2019t understand what had happened to Shi Yan in the past half a year that could have changed his bone structure.A few minutes later, the troop, including Shi Yan and Han Zhong, arrived at the gate.\u201cHi Big Grandpa, Uncle Han, Father.\u201d Shi Yan walked up to the gate with steady steps and greeted them.Han Zhong came over as well, greeting Shi Jian and Han Feng, and nodded at Yang Hai, then he stood silently beside Shi Yan.Shi Jian and Han Feng\u2019s bright eyes moved over Shi Yan\u2019s body.After a long time, Shi Jian\u2019s eyes trembled. He took a deep breath, and said to Shi Yan, \u201cFollow me.\u201d Then Shi Jian turned and headed to the back yard light-footedly.Everyone who knew Shi Jian understood that he was in high spirits.\u201cKid, put on a good show!\u201d Han Zhong made a face at Shi Yan, implying that he was going to see better days.Shi Yan gracefully acknowledged him and nodded softly. He turned to Yan Hai, \u201cFather, are you especially waiting for me?\u201dThough Yang Hai had a rigid face, a light smile appeared around the corners of his mouth, \u201cNo one is waiting for you specifically. I just wanted to see what happened to your body and whether you really reached the Nascent Level or not.\u201d\u201cHan Zhong, come over here. I have a question for you.\u201d Han Feng threw a look at Han Zhong and left in the opposite direction to Shi Yan.Han Zhong hung his head, with a worried look on his face, and followed after his brother reluctantly.\u201cWell, go. Don\u2019t keep your Big Grandpa waiting for too long.\u201d Yang Hai mumbled as he pulled Shi Yan\u2019s jacket and asked in a low voice, \u201cWhat the hell happened to you?\u201d\u201cBig Grandpa will also ask about it later. So, I guess I will explain then.\u201d Shi Yan smiled, not showing much respect for his father.Yang Hai was a little surprised. He gazed at Shi Yan and asked in confusion, \u201cKid you are different now. You never beat around the bush, and always answered my questions straightforwardly. But now\u2026 you do not seem to be afraid of me. Kid, seems like you\u2019ve grown up and don\u2019t take my concerns into account anymore.\u201d\u201cYou are my father, why would I be afraid of you?\u201d Shi Yan was astounded as he asked, \u201cWhat is there to be afraid of?\u201d\u201cThis isn\u2019t like you. You never talked to me like this.\u201d Yang Hai frowned. After a careful examination, he shook his head and said to himself, \u201cLittle bastard! You became really audacious after becoming a warrior!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna go. I can\u2019t keep Big Grandpa waiting for too long.\u201d Shi Yan smiled.Those Shi Family warriors who had crowded the gate all got confused and started another boisterous discussion.\u201cWas the family head waiting for Young Master Yan? Is it true?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. I\u2019m confused too. The family head has never appeared with Young Master Yan before, nor was he interested in his matters. What happened now?\u201d\u201cWho knows? Has Young Master Yan created trouble again? Not likely, because master Yang Hai was the one who always cleaned up his mess. Although Young Master Yan makes trouble in the Merchant Union now and then, it was not to the extent that the family head had to solve it.\u201d\u201cMaybe Young Master Yan got into huge trouble this time. Who knows.\u201d\u201cStop your idle talk. You\u2019d better be respectful to Young Master Yan from now on. He is not the book nerd you knew any more. Don\u2019t blame me once you offend him and kick up a breeze.\u201d Karl was making arrangements for the ground dragon and couldn\u2019t help but yell when he saw that people were still gossiping.\u201cKarl, what\u2019s up? You came back with Young Master Yan, do you know the details?\u201d asked a warrior who was familiar with Karl.\u201cYou will know it in no time.\u201d Karl smiled proudly, \u201cYoung Master Yan will definitely surprise you guys!\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cWhat on earth happened?\u201dTheir curiosity was even stronger as they circled Karl and couldn\u2019t stop asking.\u201cNot now. But I guess that you will know soon enough.\u201d Without giving them an exact answer, Karl squeezed his way out of the crowd and left with the troop of warriors.\u2026In the backyard of Shi Family.At the center of the huge training field, the diamond-shaped test jade was glinting in the sunshine as if it was a small sun.Shi Jian was standing beside the testing jade. As Shi Yan and Yang Hai came over, he patted the jade and suddenly, a ball of light flew into the jade from his hand.The dazzling testing jade dimmed at once and returned to its original color.\u201cInject your Profound Qi into the testing jade.\u201d Shi Jian announced with firm eyes.Shi Yan confidently walked up to the testing jade, stretched out his hand, and pressed on the jade. He operated his Profound Qi and injected it into the testing jade.Complex patterns showed up on the silver testing jade and a vague orange light shone from it. Gradually the light got brighter and the color deeper.\u201cOk now.\u201d Shi Jian\u2019s mouth trembled as he focused his eyes on Shi Yan, \u201cI heard that the Martial Spirit of Shi Family also awakened in your body, did it?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cShow me.\u201d\u201cOK.\u201dShi Yan stretched out the other hand and rolled up his sleeve.As he operated the Martial Spirit according to his will, his arm gradually petrified and became dark brown.\u201cDark brown!\u201dShi Jian and Yang Hai cried out at the same time with great amazement on their faces, while gazing at Shi Yan\u2019s brown arm in astonishment.\u201cIs it because of the light?\u201d Yang Hai blinked his eyes and rubbed them, then looked directly into the sun, and mumbled, \u201cAm I dazzled?\u201dUpon hearing that, Shi Jian also got confused . He grabbed Shi Yan\u2019s arm and demanded, \u201cCome up here! Go into the shadow of that rock so the color can be seen clearly .\u201dShi Yan didn\u2019t attempt to refuse and peacefully walked after him to the back side of the rock.\u201cIt is dark brown!\u201dShi Jian shouted loudly and his breathing got heavier. His bright eyes stared at Shi Yan as he asked in a dignified tone, \u201cLittle bastard, what the hell has happened to you? Why? Why is your Martial Spirit dark brown? Is it at the second stage of Petrification?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely. It is at the second stage. Though I\u2019m a mere Nascent Level warrior, my Martial Spirit reached the second stage!\u201d\u201cGive us a reasonable explanation! We Shi Family, from the far ancestors to my generation, had never come across this situation! Our Martial Spirit never reaches the second stage before we reach Human Level. You are the first one! What happened? What on earth happened to you?!\u201d Shi Jian was almost mad.\u201cWell, the thing is\u2026\u201d Shi Yan repeated what he had told Han Zhong for a second time.After he finished his story, Shi Jian kept his position and stared at him with a weird expression.\u201dBig Grandpa, what do you mean by that look? I explained it.\u201c\u201cYou mean three magical red fruits awoke your Martial Spirit? And made your Martial Spirit so odd? And gave you Profound Qi and helped to advance to the Third Sky of Nascent Level?\u201d Shi Jian\u2019s face got more and more twisted as he yelled, \u201cJust because of three fruits?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s it.\u201d\u201cWhere is this fruit? I will send people to see if we can plant more of it.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t bother, there were only three. I searched for a very long time but never saw it again.\u201d\u201cLittle bastard! You are not fooling me, are you?\u201d Shi Jian showed obvious suspicion.\u201cOf course I\u2019m fooling you.\u201dShi Yan thought to himself but looked serious as he reassured, \u201cI really have no idea. Anyway, I ate the fruits, and that\u2019s it. Nothing else. Even I don\u2019t know the reason why my Martial Spirit is different from others\u2019.\u201dHe insisted without any reluctance.Shi Jian kept asking a few more times and tried to test him, but the only response he got was \u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201dFinally Shi Jian gave up. After another thought, he said, \u201cSince your Martial Spirit turned dark brown, hmm, well, has the feature of the Martial Spirit changed? I mean, Did it merely change its color but still kept the intensity of the first stage?\u201d\u201cIf my sense is accurate, it is the second stage.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI will try.\u201d Shi Jian hurried to press his hand on Shi Yan\u2019s chest, \u201cKid, cover your body with petrification! Don\u2019t worry, I will increase my power little by little so it won\u2019t hurt you.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dGradually, a ball of dark light appeared in Shi Jian\u2019s palm and the energy in it grew stronger and stronger, striking on his chest.Suddenly, Shi Jian withdrew all the dark light like a sponge by the other hand.Shi Jian was so excited that he couldn\u2019t help but nod and say joyfully, \u201cAmazing! It really is the second stage! Bastard, I don\u2019t know how you managed this, but from this day on, you can\u2019t be lazy!

The sharp tips on it were like short rods shining with a dark light.Shi Yan\u2019s body had already turned dark brown and he was breathing heavily. Moving around the mace, he kept slamming into it with his shoulders, arms, waist and thighs in turns.Endless blunt thunderous sounds came out from the Gravity Room.To trigger the potential of the Petrification Martial Spirit of the Shi Family, one must train themselves in a ruthless way. Only by slamming against hard objects, could the power of Petrification be used to the fullest.And only by ruthlessly tormenting one\u2019s body, could his Petrification Martial Spirit adapt to any kind of attacks from his opponents.There were seven dark Gravity pillars erected in the Gravity Room, which increased the gravity in the room to seven times normal gravity.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dWith his upper body naked, Shi Yan wore a serious face, while he was training his body to the limit in order to activate the potential of his Petrification Martial Spirit.Everytime he slammed into the mace with his body, it would send out a thin layer of brown light.The light flashed for a short moment. It would explode the moment Shi Yan\u2019s body touched the mace, and would disappear soon after the touch.After about five thousand repetitions with different parts of his body, Shi Yan collapsed, unable to use his energy anymore. With his limbs spread out, he laid down in the center of the room letting his sweat flow like a stream over his skin which wet the green stone ground.It had been half a month.In the past half a month, Shi Yan ate and slept in the Gravity Room. He never left the room even to go to the restroom.That was Shi Jian\u2019s plan.As soon as Shi Jian found out that Shi Yan\u2019s Martial Spirit had reached the second stage, he made Shi Yan stop his other training and focus on refining his body.Shi Jian meant to trigger the entire potential of Shi Yan\u2019s second stage Petrification Martial Spirit at the fastest speed, and to strengthen his body structure to the extent that it could bear the attacks from a Human Level warrior.During the past half month, Shi Jian, Han Feng, Yang Hai, and other elders came to watch him now and then.Shi Jian, for example, would come to see him every three days. He would examine the changes on Shi Yan\u2019s body carefully and give him some advice on the training intensity for the next stage.Lying on the ground with fatigue, Shi Yan began to adjust his breathing slowly. After feeling more strength in his arms and legs, he managed to sit up and began to operate his Profound Qi.Though he was exhausted, his Profound Qi circulated even faster than before. During this process Shi Yan closed his eyes, and tried to calm his heart clear his mind.Everytime he went to this state, he found that his blood, flesh, cells and bones were all nourishing his body in a way he couldn\u2019t understand.His broken body would soon recover from his extreme fatigue and gain strength.This was the self-recovery of the Immortal Martial Spirit!Shi Yan knew it well.Not knowing how much time had passed, he woke up gradually with his eyes as bright as the stars. After meditating, the fatigue in his body disappeared and his Profound Qi became active. There seemed to be a strong explosiveness in it which was about to break out.At this moment, the stone door of the Gravity Room opened a little.Han Zhong walked in with a big smile and seven bamboo baskets in his hands.He put down the bamboo baskets and took out the delicate dishes one by one, \u201cToday\u2019s dishes: bird\u2019s nest, sea cucumber, turtle, bear\u2019s palm, glossy ganoderma. Brother Yan, you are too gluttonous! One meal for you is even more than five meals of what the other young masters of Shi Family eat. If you were in a small family, everything would be eaten by you.\u201dHan Zhong laughed as he put down the plates and secretly took out a jar of wine, \u201cThis jar of wine called \u2018Flame\u2019 is part of my collection. Drink it up quickly and I will dispose of it.\u201dShi Yan didn\u2019t try to refuse as he walked over to Han Zhong quickly and began to swallow the food. After wolfing down the rich dishes which only wealthy families could afford, he took up the jar of \u2018Flame\u2019, raised his head, and drank.Wiping his mouth and putting the empty jar down, he chuckled, \u201cOld Han, you should bring me two jars of it next time. One jar is not enough!\u201d\u201cBrother Yan, the wine \u2018Flame\u2019 is from the Spring Pavilion, costing five hundred purple crystal coins!\u201d Han Zhong squeezed out a bitter smile, \u201cI saved this one last time I went there. I will bring you \u2018Knife\u2019 tomorrow, which only costs one hundred blue crystal coins. I can even bring you four jars of it!\u201d\u201cThey are only crystal coins!\u201d Shi Yan didn\u2019t care at all, \u201cBring me \u2018Flame\u2019, I will give you the crystal coins next time!\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s ok with me.\u201d Han Zhong smirked, \u201cBrother Yan, the family head kept it confidential about you being a warrior. Most warriors and escorts in the family don\u2019t know about it. Do you know why?\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Shi Yan asked lazily.\u201cThe Martial Competition that occurs every five years is going to happen in three months. You know, in the last competition, we were surpassed by the Mo and Ling Families, so the family head roared for days after that. This time\u2026\u201d\u201cHe wants me to attend the Martial Competition?\u201d Shi Yan responded in surprise before Han Zhong finished his speech.The Martial Competition was a big event co-held by the five biggest families in the Merchant Union which every warrior could attend.The competitions happened according to five levels: Elementary Level, Nascent Level, Human Level, Disaster Level and Earth Level. Warriors of every level could compete for the first three places of their respective levels.The five big families would offer a lot of training materials as rewards; such as medicine pills, treasures, Martial skills and so forth for the winners.The five big families co-held the Martial Competition for two reasons. On one hand, they needed to pick expert warriors to strengthen their power. On the other hand, the competition would be motivation for warriors in this country to train hard to enhance the power of the country.Those individual warriors who weren\u2019t attached to any big family longed for the medicine pills, treasures and Martial Skills. Some of them were also looking for an opportunity to attach themselves to a big family.Therefore, every Martial Competition would attract thousands of warriors and would be very energetic.Apart from those individual warriors, the five big families would send out their descendants to compete in the competition.That way, they were able to show their strength and attract outstanding warriors to choose them.Therefore, the Martial Competition was not only an opportunity for the big families to attract warriors, but also a stage for them to secretly fight.Thus, both the warriors and mercenaries in this country and the five big families attached great importance to the Martial Competition.Sometimes, the ownership of controversial properties among the five families will be decided through the competition.For example, in the last competition, the Shi Family and the Mo Family staked the ownership of three mines.Unfortunately, in the battles among the third descendants, except Shi Tianyun, the other Shi Family descendants,Shi Tianluo and Shi Tianke, were beaten by the Mo Family descendants. So in the end, the Mo Family won two mines and the Shi Family only won one.\u201cYou may not know, but we fought a lot with the Mo Family over disputes on some properties recently. So the same thing may happen again in the Martial Competition this year. They may stake the ownership of some properties.\u201d\u201cWhich means, I\u2019m going to have a chance to perform?\u201d\u201cSure! The family head must be hopeful that you will win for our family. That\u2019s why he is so strict with you and comes to watch you every three days. You don\u2019t know how busy he is recently, but he still makes time to check on you, which shows how much he cares about you.\u201d\u201cOk, I got it.\u201d\u2026In the Rock Room.Sitting upright on a huge rock, Shi Yan\u2019s bright eyes had a serious look in them, seeming to be in deep thought.\u201cOn the auction in the Misty Pavilion, there was a fragment picture of The Sky Gate\u2026\u201d Han Feng was reporting the latest news to Shi Jian who was standing next to him.The Sky Gate was a magical portal leading to the God Area, a mysterious space. The God Area may exist in the Grace Mailand, or may not. It was an independent space.No one knew how the God Area was formed, or its structure, or where would it appear.Only through the Sky Gate, could one one enter the God Area.There were various versions of the legends about the God Area.It was said that there were all sorts of mysterious things in different God Areas. Martial Skills of Spirit Level and even God Level, bizarre drugs, rare treasures\u2026\u201cFour months ago, the Medicine King Mu Xun\u2018s disciple Karu stole a fragment picture from his teacher. Maybe the two fragments come from the same picture. And are they two separate fragments or just the same one? Maybe the one in the Misty Pavilion is the one Karu had stolen.\u201d Shi Jian had a quick thought when he recalled the news from four months ago.Han Feng shook his head, \u201cThat Karu had disappeared a long time ago. But the fragment in the Misty Pavilion was provided by a woman. Seeing it is a serious matter, the Misty Pavilion didn\u2019t sell it directly but kept it in the name of \u2018authenticating\u2019.\u201d\u201cThat broken picture is still at the Misty Pavilion?\u201d Shi Jian asked firmly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYep.\u201d Han Feng nodded, \u201cThe Beiming Family, the Mo Family, the Ling Family and the Zuo Family had all contacted the Misty Pavilion to purchase that fragment after they got the news. But the Misty Pavilion won\u2019t put it up for auction before they authenticate it, so the four families merely showed their strong interest without taking any secret actions.\u201d\u201cIt is only a mere fragment. If it was a complete picture, the Beiming Family would have stolen it.\u201d Shi Jian sneered.\u201cDo we need to take action?\u201d\u201cKeep an eye on it but don\u2019t get involved for the time being. Remember to exchange information with the Zuo Family. We can\u2019t act bluntly before the second fragment appears.\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They looked like they were moulded from metal and looked full of explosiveness.While being provided with abundant food, Shi Yan spent another month intensely training his body. During this time he had not only gotten stronger, but he had also become taller.Abruptly, the door was pushed open.Shi Jian, Han Feng and Yang Hai showed up at the door.Shi Jian\u2019s torch-like eyes glanced at Shi Yan from afar before nodding, \u201cIt seems you haven\u2019t been idle.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d Shi Yan answered whilst exhausted, and didn\u2019t change his position, \u201cI guess I have refined my body enough. I need to choose a Martial Skill to train with.\u201d\u201cWell, you are not the one to decide that.\u201d Shi Jian swaggered up to him and said with a rigid face, \u201cGive me one of your hands.\u201dShi Yan stretched out his left hand in response and focused. Immediately, his left arm petrified into a dark brown colour.Under scrutiny, wisps of shining dark light could be seen on the surface of his arm, forming what looked like a thin transparent layer covering his arms.\u201cWow!\u201dShi Jian exclaimed with excitement and observed happily, \u201cHa! You really are something! There turns out to be dark light! You trained really hard! So great! Great!\u201dYang Hai was delighted as he walked up as well, \u201cStep-father, is this state equivalent to the Human Level? Years ago when Qing reached the Third Sky of Human Level, her skin also sent out dark light after Petrification. Is this the same thing?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Shi Jian nodded calmly with a little muscular spasm in the corner of his mouth, \u201cThe kid is really promising! He improved so much in a mere half a month. This is amazing!\u201dAlthough Shi Jian didn\u2019t want to make Shi Yan overly prideful, he couldn\u2019t help but praise him with a surprised face, \u201cKid, how on earth did you manage that?\u201d\u201cI trained how you told me to. I kept at it, and this is the result.\u201d Shi Yan shrugged indifferently.\u201cHow long do you train for each day?\u201d Even Han Feng, who was rarely talkative, couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cAbout fifteen hours.\u201d\u201cFifteen hours?!\u201dHan Feng and Shi Jian cried out at the same time. They looked at each other and found astonishment in each other\u2019s eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible! You bastard! You must be fooling us!\u201d Shi Jian yelled and said firmly, \u201cYour body needs at least eighteen hours to be fully recovered before the next intensive slam training. And you need time for meals. It\u2019s more than enough for you to train for five hours a day! Where did fifteen hours come from?\u201dHan Feng was skeptical as well, as he shook his head softly.\u201cLittle bastard, tell us the truth. Don\u2019t be naughty in front of your big grandpa.\u201d Yang Hai grunted and reproached.\u201cWho says I need eighteen hours to recover?\u201d Shi Yan said light-heartedly, \u201cI just need four hours.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201dShi Jian and Han Feng yelled in surprise at the same time.\u201cYour body won\u2019t recover so soon after such intensive training! I have managed the Shi Family for so many years and have never seen anyone who could recover in such short time! Shi Yang was the most talented kid I\u2019ve seen and even he needed about fifteen hours to recover when he did slam training at the Human Level!\u201d Shi Jian shook his head and grunted, \u201cYou mean to say that you recover four times faster than him? Do you even think that is possible?\u201d\u201cNothing is impossible.\u201d Shi Yan smiled and stood up immediately. He walked to the corner of the room and took out a dagger from the bag on the ground. \u201cBig Grandpa, something has confused me for a long time. Now that my father is here, I want to ask for your permission to do a test.\u201d\u201cWhat test?\u201d Shi Jian frowned.\u201cUncle Han, I want to cut your arm.\u201d\u201cBastard!\u201d Shi Jian shouted, \u201cKid, what are you talking about!\u201d\u201cJust a slight cut.\u201d Shi Yan kept calm, \u201cAnd for an accurate comparison, I will also cut my father\u2019s and my own arms as well.\u201d\u201cFamily head, Maybe Young Master Yan had some plan. Why not have a try.\u201d\u201cWhat the hell do you want to do?\u201d Shi Jian was confused.\u201cYou will know.\u201d Shi Yan walked to Han Feng in an easy manner, \u201cUncle Han, please don\u2019t operate your Profound Qi, even if it bleeds, ok?\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cSo I will do it now?\u201d\u201cOk.\u201dShi Yan walked up and made a cut on Han Feng\u2019s left arm. Crimson blood gushed out at once.\u201cFather, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Shi Yan walked toward Yang Hai.\u201cLittle bastard! What are you going to do? Your father is not a warrior! Be gentle!\u201d\u201cOk. I know it.\u201d Shi Yan stepped up and made a cut as fast as lightning on Yang Hai\u2019s arm.Seeing his bleeding arm, Yan Hai screamed and yelled, \u201cLittle bastard! You are so cruel! I wasn\u2019t ready!\u201dUnder Han Feng and Shi Jian\u2019s gaze, Shi Yan then casually cut on his own arm and watched as it started to bleed.\u201cBastard, what do you want to show us? What do you mean by this? I can\u2019t see anything!\u201d Yang Hai clamored.\u201cWait, wait for a moment.\u201d Shi Yan was quite serious now and his expression became more rigid.Han Feng and Shi Jian were full of suspicion as they couldn\u2019t figure out what was going on and moved their eyes over to Shi Yan.Shi Yan smiled but didn\u2019t give them an explanation. He covered his bleeding arm with his jacket, not letting them see it.Ten minutes later.\u201cWhat?\u201dHan Feng noticed something strange first as he gazed at Yang Hai\u2019s arm in astonishment, \u201cFamily head, look!\u201dShi Jian was focusing on Shi Yan, and upon hearing Han Feng, turned to Yang Hai.He also noticed the strange thing, \u201cHai, why did the blood on your arm freeze and turn into a blood cocoon?\u201d\u201cAhh!\u201d Yang Hai cried out as soon as he noticed the cocoon, \u201cI don\u2019t know!\u201d\u201cBut my arm is still bleeding\u2026\u201d Han Feng stretched out his arm and showed it to Yang Hai.\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Yang Hai asked in surprise, \u201cYou trained with Martial Skills for so many years and your body quality is higher than mine. You should have stopped bleeding earlier than me! What happened!\u201d\u201cLook at my arm.\u201dShi Yan smiled and unbuttoned his jacket to show them his arm, and wiped the frozen blood away.The cut on his arm turned to be as thin as a needle and the flesh on the both sides seemed to be moving toward each other and recovering quickly.Shi Jian and Han Feng were aghast and quivered.\u201cBastard, wha..what on earth is going on?\u201d Shi Jian asked after a long astonishment.\u201cThis is a type of Martial Spirit! My father possesses it as well. But he doesn\u2019t train in Martial Arts and hasn\u2019t been severely hurt before, so he never noticed it.\u201d Shi Yan spilled out this secret calmly.Shi Jian kept silent with his eyes shining brightly and hands clenching. After a long while he burst into wild laughter, \u201cHaha! Martial Spirit! Self-recovery Martial Spirit!\u201d\u201cI call it the Immortal Martial Spirit.\u201d Shi Yan explained, \u201cI assume that this Martial Spirit could recover lost limbs and heal internal organs at its highest stage. Which means, one would be immortal.\u201dHan Feng and Shi Jian were stunned, but after some careful thought, they both realized the power of this Martial Spirit. They couldn\u2019t suppress their excitement anymore as their breathing became faster.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cBastard, so you possess twin Martial Spirits now?\u201d Yang Hai wasn\u2019t able to contain his joy either as he realized this and couldn\u2019t help but cry out.\u201cOf course it\u2019s twin Martial Spirits! Absolutely!\u201d Shi Jian laughed wildly. He patted Yang Hai\u2019s back so hard that the latter fell to the ground. \u201cHai, I can\u2019t believe you possess a Martial Spirit as well! Haha! I\u2019ve never thought of that! I should have cut your body when you were still a kid! Haha!\u201d\u201cNow do all of you believe I can recover in four hours?\u201d Shi Yan smiled.\u201cDefinitely! Completely! Haha!\u201d Shi Jian couldn\u2019t be happier. Ignoring Yang Hai who was still sitting on the ground, he declared, \u201cKid, come with me! Let\u2019s go to the Martial Spirit Palace! All the secret Martial Skills are kept there. You can choose any you want!\u201d\u201cGreat.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51 The Martial Spirit PalaceThere were five floors in the Martial Spirit Palace of the Shi Family.Every floor was named after the cultivation levels and each floor held the Martial Skill books corresponding to that cultivation level.On the first and the second floor were Martial Skills of the Mortal Level. Generally, Elementary Level warriors would choose from the Martial Skills on the first floor, while Nascent Level warriors would choose the books on the second floor.On the third and fourth floor were the Martial Skills of the Profound Level. Human Level warriors would go to the third floor and Disaster Level warriors to the fourth floor.The fifth floor of the Martial Spirit Palace held the sole Spirit Level Martial Skill of the Shi Family.But this floor was exclusively for the family head, Shi Jian, who occasionally went up there.The Spirit Level Martial Skill was so special that even the Ministers of the Shi Family didn\u2019t have a chance to look at it. Only the Shi descendants who reached the Earth Level would have the chance to train with it.However, among the Shi descendants, Shi Yang had reached the highest level, but was only at the Third Sky of the Disaster Level. He was still one step away from the Earth Level.\u2026Shi Jian led Shi Yan directly to the Martial Spirit Palace.In front of the Martial Spirit Palace, an old woman with wrinkles all over her face bowed as she saw Shi Jian, \u201cFamily head.\u201dThis old woman was named Yun Luo, an old Minister of the Shi Family. Like Han Feng, she was also a Nirvana Level warrior of the First Sky. It was said that she was even older than Shi Jian. She was already a Minister when Shi Jian was a little boy.She had stayed in the Shi Family for decades and was trusted by Shi Jian, so she was assigned to guard the Martial Spirit Palace.\u201cI will help Shi Yan choose his Martial skills.\u201d Shi Jian strode to the door, turned and ordered Han Feng and Yang Hai, \u201cYou two wait here for a moment.\u201dHan Feng and Yang Hai nodded together.Yun Luo stepped away for Shi Jian and Shi Yan to enter the palace. And as soon as they entered it, she stood at the door and nodded at Han Feng with a weird expression.During the past few days, Shi Yan was closely protected by Shi Jian and stayed in the Gravity Room day and night.Not to mention Yun Luo, even the relatives of Shi Family didn\u2019t know much about Shi Yan\u2019s latest achievements.And now Shi Jian had taken him to the Martial Spirit Palace to choose Martial skills in person, which means Shi Yan was officially a warrior!Yun Luo knew about Shi Yan. She knew that this young master didn\u2019t possess a Martial Spirit and was not into Martial Arts as a kid. Now he was seventeen and turned out to be a warrior. This was too abnormal!Thus, Yun Luo was confused.As she couldn\u2019t figure it out, Yun Luo looked to Han Feng in suspicion, but Han Feng shook his head, implying that he couldn\u2019t explain.Yun Luo was even more confused, but didn\u2019t ask anymore. She stood at the door and began to think.If it was a normal day, she would have closed the iron door and followed the visitor into the Martial Spirit Palace, in case they went into an unsuitable floor.But this time Shi Jian took Shi Yan there in person, so she didn\u2019t need to be too cautious.\u2026\u201cThere are eighteen Mortal Level Martial Skills on the first and the second floor, eight Profound Level Martial Skills on the third floor, and four Profound Level Martial Skills on the fourth floor. Now that you are at the Third Sky of Nascent Level, you can go up to the second floor directly.\u201dShi Jian briefly explained to Shi Yan and took him directly to the second floor.On the walls of every floor of the Martial Spirit Palace, there were several stone grooves. In each of these grooves, there was a book on Martial Skills.The grooves were covered with green crystals, at the center of which was a small key hole. A piece of paper beside the keyhole briefly introduced the Martial Skill located in each groove.After walking around the second floor, Shi Yan found that at least ten Martial Skills of the eighteen Martial Skills were ordinary and were trained by many Mercenaries and warriors, such as Kinmo\u2019s \u2018Star Fist\u2019.The other eight Martial Skills were rarely seen outside, but their power and training process seemed quite simple to Shi Yan.Deep down, Shi Yan was someone who loved a challenge, who loved the process in solving a problem.Therefore, after walking around on the second floor, Shi Yan shook his head, \u201cBig Grandpa, the Martial Skills on this floor are too boring. Let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201dIf it was one year ago, Shi Yan couldn\u2019t have talked to Shi Jian like this.But Shi Yan had demonstrated his Immortal Martial Spirit, which gave him the right to do what he wanted.To him, only the mysterious Martial Spirit was important to him, so he wouldn\u2019t say a word about it to anyone.But the Immortal Martial Spirit was far from a secret, and only by showing it to others could he gain more privileges in Shi Family and receive more training from Shi Jian.As he possessed twin Martial Spirits, Shi Jian would tolerate anything.As expected, Shi Jian didn\u2019t show any disagreement. He was a little hesitant as he grunted, \u201cYou are a mere Nascent Level warrior. It\u2019s not a good thing to train in Profound Level Martial Skills.\u201d\u201cAm I an average person? You see, though I\u2019ve just reached Nascent Level, my Petrification has already reached the Second Stage. Beside, I possess the ability to quickly recover which others don\u2019t have. The average person may be not suitable to train in Profound Level Martial Skills as my level, but maybe I am.\u201dHearing upon this, Shi Jian was surprised and he nodded, \u201cWell, you have a point. Let\u2019s go upstairs.\u201dOne after another, mysterious Martial Skill were laid in the grooves. If Shi Yan showed any interest in a Martial Skill, Shi Jian would patiently explain its features and training process to him.\u201cGreat, the Martial Skills on the third floor are much more interesting!\u201d Shi Jian kept nodding his head, and he quickly noted all the Profound Level Martial Skills on the third floor in his heart. After a while, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s go to the fourth floor now.\u201d\u201cOk, I will give you a detailed explanation of the four Martial Skills on the fourth floor. You are different from those common people, so I can explain them in advance.\u201dShi Jian then took Shi Yan to the fourth floor.As they got to the fourth floor, Shi Jian walked to a groove directly. \u201cThis is \u2018Star Net\u2019, which can turn one\u2019s Profound Qi into light and weave it into a star net. This star net can directly restrain the enemy\u2019s Profound Qi so he can\u2019t use it at all.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing!\u201d\u201cWell. It\u2019s currently beyond your ability. This Martial Skill requires very dense Profound Qi and complete control of your Profound Qi. You are too far away from it!\u201dShi Jian was very strict. He sneered and walked to another groove, \u201cThis is \u2018Desert Prints\u2019, which can produce thousands of hand prints from all directions and block the enemy\u2019s movement, pushing them to fight you directly. We of the Shi Family have a special Martial Spirit, and used in conjunction with \u2018Desert Prints\u2019, we can release our ability to the fullest. This \u2018Desert Prints\u2019 is the perfect match for our Petrification Martial Spirit!\u201d\u201cThis is great too.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s also beyond your ability. You can\u2019t train with it before you reach Disaster Level, for the same reasons as before. How can you block people from all directions if you can\u2019t even release a hand print?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the next one?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s \u2018Dark Moon Shadow\u2019. When trained to the highest state, your body would turn into an untouchable shadow. It\u2019s not easy either. It requires a high level and the help of the energy of Disaster Level. So just forget about it.\u201d\u201cThis is the last groove.\u201dShi Jian exclaimed as he seemed to find something. His eyes brightened and then he paused, \u201cThis Martial Skill trains one\u2019s fingers. Once you complete it, your fingers will be as sharp as knives and can pierce the enemy\u2019s body easily. It\u2019s very easy to defeat an enemy and completely shatter him after training in this Martial Skill. Combined with our Petrification Martial Spirit, it has an extremely strong power.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m intrigued about this one!\u201d Shi Yan was surprised, \u201cAny special requirements?\u201d\u201cThere are. But it seems you are very suitable for it.\u201d Shi Jian said after hesitation, \u201cTo train with the Finger Gun, one needs to reach the second stage of Petrification and have the dark light first. Thus he won\u2019t break his fingers while training. Hmm, you can train with it.\u201d\u201cThen I choose this one.\u201d Shi Yan said decisively.Shi Jian gazed at Shi Yan with a weird look and sank in deep thought.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Anything else?\u201d Shi Yan felt a little anxious.\u201cKid, you really want to train with this Finger Gun?\u201d Shi Jian took a deep breath and looked abnormal.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d\u201cYou can train with it at a very fast speed and your Immortal Martial Spirit would be used to its fullest.\u201d Shi Yan paused then continued speaking, \u201cBut it\u2019s a hideous process to train the Finger Gun! It\u2019s much harder than slamming your body into the mace! It\u2019s complete torture! You really want to try it? Not those Elementary Martial Skills?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cOk, then I will tell to the process to train the Finger Gun. Your fingers will become very sharp after you finish the training process. But it\u2019s torture to get there\u2026\u201d\u2026A day later, in the Gravity Room.Out of seven gravity pillars, six were covered by the skins of a fifth-level demon beast, the Silver Snake. The skin could negate the gravity, so the gravity was currently two times normal.Beside the only pillar not covered by the snake skin, Shi Yan was positioned upside down, supported by the index finger of his left hand.This thin index finger was supporting his whole body weight, which was twice as heavy due to the increased gravity.His index finger was trembling slightly and seemed about to break at anytime.Shi Yan\u2019s face was as red as a lobster. The muscles on his left arm were quivering and the veins were shaking like small snakes which were trying to force their way out of his skin.Extreme pain came from his fingertip to his heart!It felt like numerous needles were stabbing into his finger. The pain stroked his nerves like waves and he was about to break down.Endure it!Shi Yan gritted his teeth and blood was about to gush out of his face. As he was positioned upside down, his blood had flowed down into his head which was intolerable.Five minutes.Shi Yan was about to break down after only five minutes.The pain from his finger almost made him give up. It would have broken if it wasn\u2019t petrified.Carry on!Six minutes! Seven minutes!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen it came to the eighth minute, Shi Yan was at the edge of breaking down, and his consciousness began to dim\u2026Just then!All sorts of negative emotions exploded in the meridians of his head all at once.All the negative emotions gushed into his mind crazily!\u2018Rampage\u2019 had been triggered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

While his head was still hurting severely, his limbs began to contract.Thin white smoke poured out from every single one of his pores\u2026A layer of pale smoke rapidly wrapped around him. Combined with the smoke was a murderous, bloody smell which encouraged people to kill!As all the negative energy escaped from his meridians, his body contracted by one third!Standing there with his skinny body, Shi Yan was surrounded with the desire for blood, which also filled his body.Suddenly, the pain in his mind disappeared all at once.Opening his eyes, Shi Yan found his nerves had become more acute and he could even think and calculate faster.His mind could maintain a very calm state!The wisps of negative energy in his head seemed to combine with his nerves and had made his body extremely sensitive!Standing there, he could even feel the changes the negative energy had made in his flesh and blood and how much power it had brought him.Now he had become an unfeeling machine without any human emotions. The only thing left in his mind were methods to kill. How to kill quickly and efficiently.He was a most hideous creature right now!All other thoughts other than murder were disposed of. The only thing he could think of was how to kill his enemies.No kindness. No concerns. Nothing but killing.\u201cHoohoo!\u201dShi Yan was breathing heavily like a murderous monster in the bloody Gravity Room. There wasn\u2019t any mercy left in his eyes and it seemed that he could kill at any time.\u201cStop!\u201dA sound echoed in his mind. With the strength of will, Shi Yan withdrew the white smoke into his meridians.Sitting down cross-legged, he closed his eyes and composed himself. He cleansed the thought of murder from his mind and let the odd negative energy slowly gush back into the meridians in his head.After a very long time.Shi Yan began to breath evenly, although he was still extremely fatigued. Then he slowly opened his eyes.The clarity in his eyes had returned and there was no trace of any coldness or bloody desire.The First Sky of \u2018Rampage\u2019!At that moment Shi Yan realized the real state of the First Sky of \u2018Rampage\u2019.Apart from the change to his body, the change to his mind was more horrifying!He believed that in that mindset, he would be the coldest killing machine and would be able to trigger all of his potential.In that state, he had no emotions, only the need to kill! All he could think about was how to kill faster and more efficiently. Too cold blooded!Horrifying!Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help but shout in his mind after he recovered and remembered that weird state.And at that moment, he realized that maybe the direction of his training was wrong.The training of \u2018Rampage\u2019 should start from the head and the whole process would be led by the head. Once \u2018Rampage\u2019 started in his head, his whole body would change with it.But he had begun to train from his hands and feet and then his whole body. When he finally trained with his head, he would body would change and then the recoil would strike the meridians in his head.Apparently he was training in an incorrect way, thus he fainted during several trainings.Now the last step of \u2018Rampage\u2019 was finally complete\u2026Exhausted, Shi Yan didn\u2019t have any energy to train his \u2018Finger Gun\u2019. He had to sit where he was and drive out the side effects of \u2018Rampage\u2019 using the Immortal Martial Spirit.After a full circulation, his Profound Qi had as recovered by a lot and so he tried to strike the blood ring.Recently, he was often trying to strike the blood ring and break another shield to see if there were other secrets.But every strike ended in failure. Although he was at the Third Sky of Nascent Level, he couldn\u2019t break another layer in the ring.His sharp Profound Qi was always blocked when touching that shield.The Profound Qi bounced back in waves. Shi Yan stood up and went to the corner of the Gravity Room and took out the Spirit Level Martial Skill book \u2018Gravitational Field\u2019 out of his bag.Sitting in the corner, Shi Yan was frowning as he was turning the pages one by one.He was very grateful to the previous master of his body now. He could read the ancient book all because of that boy\u2019s knowledge.And apart from that boy, no one else in the Shi Family could read the ancient language.Luckily that boy passed the ancient language to him. Or he would have had to find a special person who could read the ancient language and translate it for him.This was a book was a Spirit Level Martial Skill.He didn\u2019t say a word about this book even to Shi Jian or Yang Hai. It would be much too troublesome if his translator spread it.\u2026He slowly read out those ancient characters secretly in his mind.The book was not thick at all as it only had twenty seven pages. He quickly finished reading all the content.Closing the book, Shi Yan looked weird as he mumbled, \u201cThis book on the Spirit Level Martial Skill is too much fun. One needs to possess different types of power to train with it.\u201dThough this Martial Skill wasn\u2019t strict about one\u2019s cultivation level, it had strict requirements on one\u2019s power.Though it was a type of Spirit Level Martial Skill, Elementary Level and Nascent Level warriors could also train with it.There was only one requirement for training it; one had to possess at least two types of power.Only when the two powers clashed against each other would a Field be created. The space in the Field would twist and thus, create attraction.Once the Field was created, it would drag everyone but its creator into it.Under its power, anyone who was dragged into the Field would automatically spin and their blood and flesh would be squeezed. Their Profound Qi would be suppressed and they wouldn\u2019t be able to operate their Martial Skills.According to the author of the book \u2018Gravitational Field\u2019, the more types of power the trainer possessed, the more powerful the Field would be.If the trainer had three or four types of power, the Field he created could directly kill Disaster Level warriors!Once there were five types of power in the Field, even an Earth Level warrior would definitely die!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHolding the book and thinking for a while, Shi Yan chuckled softly as his eyes turned bright.Common warriors had only one type of Profound Qi in their body. Only those who possess special Martial Spirits could have another type of power, such as Di Yalan\u2019s Blue Magic Flame.Apparently most warriors couldn\u2019t train with this magical Spirit Level Martial Skill, because very it was rare for people to possess two or three types of powers in their body.Luckily Shi Yan was among the minority. The negative energy from his meridians was very different from Profound Qi.He could train with it directly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The previous chapters will be updated to reflect this.\u2014\u2014\u2014In the Gravity Room.Shi Yan leaned against the Gravity Pillar, standing upside down while balanced on the middle finger of his left hand, all of his veins popping out.A quarter of an hour later, he switched to his ring finger. Every fifteen minutes, he would shift to the next finger and repeat the process all over again.After one complete cycle, Shi Yan sat on the green stone ground covered in sweat. He stretched out his left hand and released some of the negative energy from the meridians in his arm.Wisps of white smoke sprawled over his arm and stealthily flew in front of him according to his will.Profound Qi was being operated in his fingers, then it quivered and was injected into the white smoke which was floating in front of Shi Yan.The Profound Qi then wriggled like a snake in the white smoke\u2026The white smoke and the Profound Qi slowly combined, forming into one after some small swirls, in which, a magical attraction suddenly erupted.As the attraction occurred, that space seemed to collapse and contract at once.The nearby air was sucked in and the surrounding space seemed to decrease sharply, feeling rather heavy.His eyes shining brightly, Shi Yan focused on the small Field and tried to feel the magical power, injecting more Profound Qi into it.Strangely, the Field didn\u2019t get any stronger. On the contrary, the magical power in it became weaker.\u201cEh?\u201dShi Yan was stunned and confused.After pondering for a long time, he seemed to figure out the trick. He stopped injecting Profound Qi and pushed some of the negative white smoke surrounding his arm into the Field.The Field which was previously getting weaker, suddenly began to strengthen as soon as the white smoke was added.Gazing at the Field for ten seconds, Shi Yan was thinking on the details. Eventually he withdrew the two types of power out of the Field.The Field disappeared at once.Through this training, he drew the conclusion that in order to strengthen the Field, the two types of power should be balanced. Only by doing this could the Field remain powerful.If one of the powers surpassed the other one, it wouldn\u2019t strengthen the Field, but break the balance and decrease its power.There needed to be an accurate balance between the two powers, or the power of the Field could not be released to the fullest extent.During these days, Shi Yan devoted himself to his two Martial Skills: [Finger Gun] and [Gravitational Field]. Apart from having three meals a day, he spent almost all of his time on his training.After a month\u2019s torment, Shi Yan had made significant progress in the [Finger Gun].Now he could stand on each of his fingers for fifteen minutes.His ten fingers became harder and harder, and would even make the sound of metal when struck after Petrification.Every time he finished training the [Finger Gun], he would delve into the Spirit Level Martial Skill book [Gravitational Field].He didn\u2019t exhaust his negative energy in his meridians every time he trained. Instead, he just released a little part of it from his arms and combined it with his Profound Qi to explore the effects of [Gravitational Field].Though the Field he formed was small, it had the the same mechanism as the big ones.After endless repeated use, he gained a deeper understanding about [Gravitational Field], and knew more about it after a period of time.The deeper he probed the [Gravitational Field] skill, the more profound he found this Spirit Level Martial Skill to be. There were many more truths hidden in it.While training in this Spirit Level Martial Skill, Shi Yan was also in the process of trying to understand the truth of this universe.Sitting there upright covered in perspiration, Shi Yan sank deep into thought.\u201cCreaakkk\u201dThe door of the Gravity Room opened, as Han Zhong walked in and yelled, \u201cBrother Yan, the family head has asked for you to come to the living room.\u201d\u201cLiving room?\u201d Shi Yan glanced at him and frowned, \u201cDidn\u2019t he forbid me from leaving the Gravity Room? Are there important visitors?\u201d\u201cZuo Xu came with that little girl Zuo Shi.\u201d Han Zhong explained while standing at the door, \u201cZuo Xu just brought Zuo Shi back from her teacher, Chi Xiao, in the Cloud Mountain. So they came to visit us on the way and discuss the Martial Competition with the family head.\u201dThe Zuo Family was one of the five big families in the Merchant Union, and was quite close to the Shi Family.The Zuo Family possessed the Shadow Martial Spirit. During fights, there would be clones beside them. Many skilled Zuo family warriors could even create seven or eight clones during a fight. These clones could move and make different actions in order to confuse the enemy.As the Zuo Family members possessed the Shadow Martial Spirit, they would be in a beneficial position from the very beginningThe opponents would mistakenly attack the clones, so the Zuo warriors could kill them easily.The Shadow Martial Spirit was not only beneficial for fights, but also made a big difference when one needed to escape.Once the Zuo warriors were threatened, they would create several clones of themselves and run in different directions. If they had only one enemy, that person could only choose one direction to chase them in.After he caught up, he would find out that it was just a clone, and their real body had already ran off somewhere else.If the real body was chased, they could create more clones and make the enemy guess again.One would break down if he came across a Zuo Family warrior and had to find the real body to chase.\u201cOk, got it.\u201d Shi Yan nodded and casually picked up a green warrior uniform from the ground and put it on. He strode out of the Gravity Room, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cErr\u2026Brother Yan, aren\u2019t you going to take a shower first?\u201d Han Zhong covered his nose with one hand and waved with the other, \u201cYou stink like sweat!\u201d\u201cNope. I will be back soon anyway.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to leave a good impression on Zuo Shi?\u201d Han Zhong looked weird, \u201cZuo Shi is well known for her talent in the Merchant Union. Tian Xiao, Tian Luo, and some other young masters are all around her these days. Aren\u2019t you going to try and impress her?\u201d\u201cZuo Shi?\u201d Shi Yan was stunned when a bright flash crossed his mind. Unexpectedly, he felt a slight sorrow in his heart, and he shook his head, \u201cWell, there is something between this girl and me\u2026\u201d\u201cExactly!\u201dHan Zhong smirked, \u201cYou were born on the same day! What a coincidence! So your grandpa and Zuo Xu nearly got you two engaged. But on the third day after her birth, she turned out to possess the Shadow Martial Spirit, while you didn\u2019t. Hmm, then no one brought your engagement up, when the two sides both chose to be silent about it\u2026\u201dHan Zhong paused and sighed, \u201cIt\u2019s natural. Zuo Shi inherited a Martial Spirit, but you didn\u2019t show yours at the beginning, which, to the Shi Family and the Zuo Family, meant that you wouldn\u2019t be successful. The Zuo Family wouldn\u2019t marry a real warrior like Zuo Shi to some commoner. And the Shi Family can\u2019t take advantage of it. So that is it.\u201dMemories hidden deep within Shi Yan\u2019s mind were awoken by Han Zhong\u2019s speech. Standing there stunned, Shi Yan slowly sorted out these memory fragments and mumbled after a long time, \u201cThat guy was really sentimental\u2026\u201d\u201cZuo Shi is incredibly talented and intelligent, but it is also said that she is rather lazy, and not into Martial Arts. Her accomplishment was the result of her family pushing her. Even so, she trains much faster than average warriors. Seventeen and the Second Sky of the Human Level! Another miracle in the Merchant Union.\u201dHan Zhong shook his head, and sighed, \u201cThat bastard Beiming Ce has also reached the Second Sky of Human Level at seventeen, but he kept training so hard. While Zuo Shi kept sleeping and fooling around\u2026 I guess Zuo Shi is more talented than Beiming Ce.\u201dShi Yan didn\u2019t reply but frowned.He could feel that slight sorrow in his heart which was triggered by Zuo Shi\u2026As he focused on the memory, Shi Yan realized that the previous master of his body was deeply in love with Zuo Shi, while she never felt anything for him.Zuo Shi was very lazy. She didn\u2019t like hard training, but was into art, nature, tea ceremony, astrology and so on\u2026Her hobbies varied. Though she didn\u2019t train hard, she could easily break the levels, and managed to reach the Second Sky of Human Level with the help of her incredible talent.Apart from her incredible talent, she also had an extraordinarily delicate face.The previous master of this body fell for Zuo Shi at the first sight. But he wasn\u2019t good with words, and knew he was at a disadvantage, so he never expressed his admiration for her.Typical unrequited love.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d after his mind wandered for a while, Shi Yan smiled, \u201cSo\u2026 that girl is a genius?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cAbsolutely!\u201dHan Zhong nodded and affirmed, \u201cOtherwise, Chi Xiao in the Cloud Mountain wouldn\u2019t have insisted on teaching Zuo Shi and taken her to the Cloud Mountain after seeing her for the first time three years ago. Chi Xiao is an expert of the Sky Level, which is very rare in the Merchant Union, Fire Empire and the God-blessed Empire. It is said that even Beiming Shang has been beaten by him.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Shi Yan looked indifferent, \u201cShall we go now?\u201d\u201cErrr\u2026 you are not moved by what I said? You are not going to clean yourself and suit up?\u201d Han Zhong smiled bitterly.\u201cNow that this girl is so popular and she is protected by Chi Xiao and Zuo Xu, I don\u2019t think I will have a chance with her.

There were flowers that bloomed during every season, sending out intoxicating fragrances.Shi Yan walked to the front of the garden and saw Zuo Shi at once, who was crowded by several boys.Among the fresh flowers, Zuo Shi was standing in a beautiful position. Her long, straight legs looked sexy.In the sunlight, her porcelain-like skin was shining elegantly. On her small, delicate face, her two big eyes were as clear as crystals.Although Shi Yan knew Zuo Shi was pretty, he was still amazed after seeing her in person.Zuo Shi was as beautiful as Mu Yu Die, and she was even taller, with longer and more delicious legs.These youths crowded around Zuo Shi like stars that circled the moon. Zuo Shi was holding a watering can and was leisurely watering the flowers, though there was a sign some helplessness in her eyes.It seemed that she didn\u2019t like to be treated like she was special.Shi Yan took a glance at her from afar and turned away. He entered the garden and directly headed towards the living room behind the garden.\u201cShi Yan!\u201dA young man\u2019s loud shout came, and many youths around Zuo Shi turned their eyes to Shi Yan.\u201cYes Brother?\u201d Shi Yan paused, turned and asked.\u201cWhere have you been these days? I heard you came back months ago, but why didn\u2019t I see you?\u201d Shi Tianxiao yelled and waved at Shi Yan, \u201cCome, Shi Yan, Little Shi has a piece of turtle shell with her and there are some odd characters on it. Aren\u2019t you an expert on these things? Come and help us check.\u201dZuo Shi, who was among these youths, was interested after hearing that. Her lake-like eyes crossed over the ten meters and settled upon Shi Yan.\u201cI\u2019m busy now. Big Grandpa is asking for me. Talk to you later.\u201dShi Yan looked indifferent and refused at once, then walked towards the living room without any hesitation.\u201cHmm.\u201dShi Tianxiao felt weird and was stunned. He smiled and explained embarrassingly, \u201cShi Yan is bad tempered, wordless and not into Martial Arts at all. All these years he has been running around all over the place. Even I don\u2019t know what he was doing. Don\u2019t worry, I will get him to read it for you.\u201dThere was suspicion in Zuo Shi\u2019s eyes. She gazed at Shi Yan\u2019s disappearing back and asked, \u201cHe is not interested in Martial Arts? Then why is his cultivation level even higher than yours?\u201d\u201cWha\u2026 what?\u201dShi Tianxiao was shocked as he hurried to ask, \u201cLittle Shi, are you serious? I have never seen him train Martial Arts for one second in the last seventeen years! Cultivation?\u201dZuo Shi\u2019s pretty face showed some surprise too. She asked earnestly after some thought, \u201cHe has reached the Third Sky of the Nascent Level, how couldn\u2019t he have trained in Martial Arts? That old man taught me his [Magical Eyes], through which I can tell anyone\u2019s cultivation. His cultivation is not higher than mine, so my estimation must be correct.\u201d\u201cThe Third Sky of Nascent Level!\u201dShi Tianluo, who was standing beside them, shook his head and shouted, \u201cNo way! It\u2019s impossible! For the past seventeen years, Shi Yan literally hasn\u2019t trained Martial Arts for even one second! How could he reach the Third Sky of the Nascent Level in one night? Don\u2019t be ridiculous!\u201dSeeing them unconvinced, Zuo Shi shook her head slightly without further explanation, and went to the other side with the watering can.\u2026\u201cBig Grandpa, what can I do for you?\u201dShi Yan walked into the living room, bowed to Shi Jian, Han Feng, and Zuo Xu one by one, and asked Shi Jian.Shi Jian nodded, stepped up, grabbed Shi Yan\u2019s arm and dragged him to the front of Zuo Xu, \u201cBrother Zuo, look at him carefully, and check how on earth he has his Martial Spirit. Your Zuo Family has collected so many classic books on Martial Spirits, you must know more about it than me. I can\u2019t figure it out. I believe you can.\u201dZuo Xu was around sixty years old with white hair along the two sides of his forehead. He didn\u2019t look arrogant or proud at all, but was extremely learned and refined.He didn\u2019t look like a family head from a big family, but rather a teacher at the school.Shi Jian and Zuo Xu had been close friends for many years, and the Shi Family and the Zuo Family were solid allies. Therefore, Shi Yan\u2019s latest news might be still a secret to most Shi Family members, but it wouldn\u2019t be a secret to Zuo Xu.Zuo Xu frowned slightly as he stretched out one of his skinny dry hands and put it on Shi Yan\u2019s wrist, \u201cPetrify your body first.\u201dShi Yan did as Zuo Xu asked.Suddenly, thousands of wisps of energy seemed to come out from his wrist like silk.The wisps felt alive as it nimbly floated to every corner of Shi Yan\u2019s body, but didn\u2019t cause him any pain, despite some itchiness.The wisps passed through his veins, probed his bones, entered his entrails, and moved over every corner of his body, and finally it went back and disappeared at his wrist.Zuo Xu released his hand and frowned deeply. After a long silence, he said, \u201cNothing strange.\u201dShi Jian was so joyful that he said in haste, \u201cYou mean, this boy has a normal Martial Spirit? And it will also improve in the future?\u201d\u201cShould be.\u201d Zuo Xu was in deep thought while his face showed a weird expression, \u201cBrother, is there another Martial Spirit in his body?\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201dShi Jian was too happy to contain himself, and he couldn\u2019t help but laugh, \u201cBrother Zuo! You are really something! Yes, there is another Martial Spirit in his body which can provide self-recovery! Haha! I intended to tell you later, but you detected it so soon!\u201dA light flashed Zuo Xu\u2019s eyes as his mouth trembled. After a long while, he nodded heavily and greeted happily, \u201cCongratulations Brother!\u201d\u201cHaha, you too, you too.\u201d Shi Jian was delighted as he laughed, \u201cYour little girl is so talented that she has already reached the Second Sky of the Human level. Even that old Chi Xiao insisted on teaching her. I bet her accomplishments will be much greater than that boy in the Beiming Family.\u201dZuo Xu shook his head with a bitter smile, and sighed with fondness, \u201cThat girl is really talented, but she is too lazy! She won\u2019t train until I force her to. Her cultivation would be much higher if she was as diligent as Beiming Ce.\u201dZuo Xu looked a little proud as he mentioned Zuo Shi\u2019s talent.\u201cYour girl advances really fast. But Shi Yan advanced to the Third Sky of the Nascent Level in a very short time too! He never trained in the past seventeen years. To mention this speed, I have never seen anyone who advances faster than him.\u201d Shi Jian replied with a smile, raising his head.Another light crossed Zuo Xu\u2019s eyes. He looked at Shi Jian, and nodded with a smile, \u201cTwin Martial Spirits are really amazing. The Shi Family will definitely win the Martial Competition this time.\u201d\u201cSure!\u201dShi Jian wasn\u2019t modest at all, as he said loudly, \u201cI kept this guy in the Gravity Room for so long so that he could teach a lesson to the Mo Family.\u201d\u201cBrother, since Shi Yan possesses twin Martial Spirits, it\u2019s understandable that his Petrification could directly advanced to the second stage.\u201dZuo Xu thought for a while, and said, \u201cAs far as I know, there is a small possibility that the two Martial Spirits in one body could change after coming into contact with each other. And that variation is harmful in most cases. The two Martial Spirits may influence each other in a negative way and decrease their power. But there is a small chance that some twin Martial Spirits could nourish each other. Shi Yan is lucky, apparently his twin Martial Spirits are compatible, therefore his Petrification could directly advanced to the second stage when he is still at the Nascent Level.\u201d\u201cYeah, this guy is really blessed! Or he wouldn\u2019t have given me such a surprise at the age of seventeen!\u201d Shi Jian nodded with a broad smile.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThen the two old men started to talk about other trivial things, seeming to forget that Shi Yan was still beside them.\u201cHmm, may I go back to the Gravity Room if there is nothing else I can do?\u201d Being ignored, Shi Yan suggested helplessly.\u201cWell, go! Hurry up! Don\u2019t be lazy!\u201d Shi Jian urged seriously.\u201cOh, by the way, you are an expert on ancient characters right?\u201d Zuo Xue remembered something and added, \u201cLittle Shi got a piece of turtle shell which has some ancient characters on it.

Every time Zuo Shi asked about something, they would answer quickly in order to create a good impression of themselves.Some of them were from the branches of the Shi family and some, such as Shi Tianxiao and Shi Tianluo, were from the direct line.Walking slowly among the fresh flowers, Zuo Shi looked a little absent-minded, though her steps didn\u2019t falter. She shook the watering can in her hand, bored and detached, like a spirit among the flowers.Shi Yan walked out of the living room, thought for a while, and directly went into the flower garden towards Zuo Shi.

Suddenly he covered his nose with his hand and cried, \u201cShi Yan, what is that smell coming from you?!\u201dA sour smell was wafting out from him.The crowd didn\u2019t notice it in the beginning as they were busy fawning over Zuo Shi. As they heard Shi Tianxiao\u2019s cry, they finally noticed and quickly covered their noses, complaining that Shi Yan was too shameful.Unexpectedly, the only girl there didn\u2019t even take a step back, but stood there carrying the watering can, seemingly not caring about the smell at all.Zuo Shi stared at Shi Yan in surprise, while confusion overtook her mind.Every man, including Shi Tianxiao and Shi Tianluo, would suit up and put some perfume on before they saw Zuo Shi, using flower essence to ensure they didn\u2019t leave a bad impression on her.But this boy was too different! His warrior gown was wrinkled and dusty; apparently he had been wearing it for a very long time. There was the strong smell coming from him indicating that he had just finished training his martial arts.This guy obviously doesn\u2019t take me seriously!Zuo Shi was stunned and soon drew this conclusion, which triggered her interest in Shi Yan.Seeing the crowd turned off but Zuo Shi still standing there, Shi Yan was a little happy, as he asked softly, \u201cWhere is the turtle shell?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s at the living room, I will get it right away.\u201d Zuo Shi replied in a very melodious voice. She then moved her beautiful legs and thin body and disappeared in an instant.The girl moved as fast as lightning. Even Shi Yan could only see her shadow pass by, unable to follow her movement.The crowd, including Shi Tianxiao, were astounded.They realized that not only was Zuo Shi pretty, but also a warrior one realm higher than them.By the time Zuo Shi had returned, the crowd were still drowning in amazement as only six seconds had passed.Zuo Shi appeared in front of Shi Yan with a basin-sized turtle shell in her hand and handed it to him, \u201cHere you are.\u201dShi Yan nodded and took the shell, only to find his body dragged down by a massive weight and he almost fell to the ground by the heavy turtle shell.He operated his Profound Qi and was barely able to stabilize his body. He exclaimed, \u201cSo heavy!\u201dHe looked to Zuo Shi in discontent and assumed she was deliberately trying to make a fool out of him!However, he found that Zuo Shi\u2019s eyes were crystal clear and devoid of any malicious intentions.\u201cYes, I don\u2019t know what this shell is made out of. It\u2019s about four hundred kilograms.\u201d Zuo Shi didn\u2019t notice that Shi Yan had secretly cursed her, instead she fingered the short hair beside her ears and added, \u201cI was surprised when I first got it.\u201d\u201cFour hundred kilograms!\u201d Shi Tianxiao rubbed his temples and felt his head go numb.Zuo Shi held the turtle shell with one hand and could still move that fast! This made him realize the distance between him and Zuo Shi and he was a little disappointed.Shi Yan was holding the turtle shell firmly after he recovered, which also improved his understanding of Shi Yan, and he now believed what Zuo Shi had previously said.\u201cShi Yan, you, you bastard\u2026\u201dThough Shi Tianxiao was not a gifted boy, he was clever enough. He realized that Shi Jian had kept this a secret, so he stopped himself before he announced Shi Yan\u2019s latest shocking news.Shi Yan remained indifferent. Without replying to Shi Tianxiao, he examined the turtle shell carefully and nodded to Zuo Shi, \u201cThis is one of the oldest languages, so I need to read it with the help of some books. Follow me to my room.\u201dAt once, Shi Yan headed to his own house with the turtle shell in his hand.\u201cOkay.\u201d Zuo Shi nodded and stepped up leisurely.\u201cBig brother, um, are we following them?\u201d Shi Tianluo showed a strange face, and asked quietly after the two had moved far away.\u201cHmm, good idea.\u201d Shi Tianxiao couldn\u2019t suppress his curiosity. Seeing no one was walking out of the living room, he also followed to Shi Yan\u2019s house.\u2026Shi Yan lived in a three storey stone house.The first floor held various trivial stuff, the second floor was for resting, and the third floor was filled with huge book shelves where Shi Yan kept all sorts of ancient books.After leading Zuo Shi to the house, Shi Yan saw that the crowd had also followed them. He shouted at them from the door, \u201cI need quiet. Don\u2019t come into my house.\u201dThen he closed the door and said to Zuo Shi, \u201cLet\u2019s go upstairs.\u201dZuo Shi nodded obediently and followed him to the second floor.\u201cWell, you go up and rest on the third floor for a while. I need to take a shower and change my clothes. I will catch up with you shortly.\u201d He handed the turtle shell back to Zuo Shi and pointed at the stairs leading to the third floor, \u201cThis way.\u201d\u201cWhy shower now?\u201d Zuo Shi rolled her eyes at him, and grunted with her delicate nose.\u201cI want to feel comfortable, it\u2019s not out of consideration for you. Don\u2019t think too much of yourself little girl.\u201d\u201cYou think too much!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t waste my time. Go to the third floor! I\u2019m taking off my clothes.\u201dNot bothering to care, Shi Yan took off his warriors gown and threw it onto the hanger. He was only in his underwear and almost naked. He glanced at Zuo Shi indifferently, \u201cWhy are you still here?\u201dAfter a long period of intense training, Shi Yan had become much stronger. Every muscle looked shiny and hard, as if moulded by iron, emitting a strong sense of masculinity.As Zuo Shi saw him take off his clothes without any shame, she panicked. She cursed, \u201cBastard!\u201d and quickly took the turtle shell up to the third floor with her face blushing.This guy\u2026 had some figure. Zuo Shi thought to herself as she was walking upstairs.The third floor covered two hundred square metres.Apart from the book shelves, there were many bizarre jars, bottles, pots and wine glasses on the expanded third floor.Zuo Shi took out an ancient book randomly, flipped it open and realized she couldn\u2019t read it.Zuo Shi shook her head and thought to herself, \u201cWhat a weirdo!\u201dZuo Shi had various hobbies as well.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe studied plants, tea ceremony, astrology, medicine and weapons, each for a short time. But she was too lazy so she couldn\u2019t focus on one thing for too long. She would switch to a new thing shortly after.These ancient books on the third floor were mostly about ancient history and ancient.Zuo Shi was not interested in them at all, so she found them all boring and difficult to understand. Now she was sure Shi Yan was officially a weirdo.Why are you interested in ancient life? What does it have to do with you? What can you do with it?Zuo Shi curled her lips, and thought that Shi Yan was more ignorant and incompetent than her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Wearing a light green long garment, he looked fairly handsome.But Zuo Shi only glanced over him once, then retracted her gaze, and continued staring at the turtle shell. She spoke, \u201cIf you\u2019re done then let us take a look at it quickly, I\u2019ve been waiting for so long.\u201dZuo Shi had seen too many attractive men, and the men of the Zuo family were all good-looking. So Zuo Shi was nearly immune to all the different types of handsome men.\u201cGirl, you\u2019re used to making people wait for you, aren\u2019t you? If you don\u2019t try waiting for someone else, how would you know how hard it is?\u201dShi Yan sneered, he didn\u2019t rush to approach her, but first he went around the bookshelves, and using the memories deeply rooted in his head, took out a heavy ancient book that was covered with dust, then moved to Zuo Shi\u2019s side.Zuo Shi stared in a daze, as she had unexpectedly blanked out due to Shi Yan\u2019s words. She nodded lightly, and spoke in agreement, \u201cYou\u2019re right, it has always been others waiting for me. I\u2019ve never waited for anyone. So this is how it feels to wait for someone\u2026 Why is it that those people waited so long for me, yet they never made a fuss, and still talked to me with a face full of smiles?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because they\u2019re low!\u201d Shi Yan commented bluntly.\u201cHa!\u201dZuo Shi chuckled, her bright eyes scanning Shi Yan, and she spoke while smiling, \u201cYou\u2019re so wicked. So how are they low?\u201d\u201cI think you shouldn\u2019t be named Zuo Shi, you should instead be called Zuo Xin Xin.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cFrom where I come from, they name children based on what they lack. Like how the name Zhao Xin (\u946b meaning gold) means lacking wealth and Wang Miao (\u6dfc meaning flood/water) means lacking water, so you should be called Zuo Xin Xin (\u5fc3 meaning wits)\u2026\u201d\u201cYou lack wits! Asshole!\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re not stupid?\u201d Shi Yan said indifferently, \u201cIf you weren\u2019t so slow-witted, how could you not know what they were thinking? They wanted to flatter you so of course they wouldn\u2019t show any discontent. All men, before they obtain a wonderful thing, act incredibly low. After they obtain it, they become even lower!\u201d\u201cAre you talking about yourself?\u201dZuo Shi\u2019s eyes brightened, and she smilingly as she looked at him.\u201cCough cough, I said normal men are like that, but I\u2019m an exception.\u201dShi Yan shamelessly stated, then crouched down, moving closer to the piece of turtle shell on the ground. With one hand, he quickly flipped through the pages of the thick ancient book. Whenever he flipped to a certain page, he would pause, his finger pointing to a specific ancient character.On the back of the basin-sized turtle shell, aside from the complex old moire pattern, was actually eight lip-sized ancient characters. Those eight ancient characters didn\u2019t seem to look like they were forcefully carved on, instead they looked like they were naturally formed by the moire patterns on the turtle shell; it was extraordinarily magical.The eight ancient characters were arranged in two lines and each character was about the same size, and gave off a cold feeling when touched.Shi Yan felt the surface of each character with his left hand, his right hand constantly flipping through the ancient book in his hand. Sometimes he wrinkled his eyebrows in thought, other times, his eyes would brighten and a smile would appear at the corner of his lips, as if he came to an understanding. He engrossed himself in deciphering the ancient characters on the turtle shell.As focused as he was, it seemed as if he didn\u2019t noticed there was a beautiful young girl nearby.Zuo Shi\u2019s dainty figure knelt down, her delicate face pointed towards him, constantly paying attention to the changes in expression on Shi Yan\u2019s face.It was to say, when Shi Yan was deeply concentrating on something, he displayed the unique charms of a man.Zuo Shi somewhat admired this kind of concentrated dedication, and she nodded silently in her mind, thinking, \u201cAlthough he has a big attitude, and rants a lot, when working on things, he\u2019s pretty serious about it.\u201d\u201cRustle! Rustle!\u201dIn the silent room, there was only the sound of Shi Yan rapidly flipping through his book. Zuo Shi had quietly kneeled down next to him, not interrupting.After a long while, Shi Yan suddenly shut the book in his hand and with a serious face he said, \u201cDone.\u201d\u201cWhat do these eight characters mean?\u201d Zuo Shi\u2019s eyes brightened, and she asked delightedly.\u201cDragon Turtle Armor! Basalt Scriptures!\u201d Shi Yan shouted with a deep voice.\u201cHey!\u201dZuo Shi whispered, pointing at the turtle shell, and spoke in surprise, \u201cThe turtle shell is glowing because of your voice!\u201dShi Yan was surprised, and hurriedly looked down. The meticulous moire pattern on the turtle shell was indeed releasing a faint green glow.It was as if the eight ancient characters were brought to life, slowly shifting on the turtle shell, reforming altogether.Staring, both Zuo Shi and Shi Yan were stunned.The eight ancient characters, after shifting for a while, formed a hand-shaped indent.On the turtle shell, there was a light green glow that was swirling, and strange continuous pulses escaped from the turtle shell. The air in the room seemed to be attracted to the turtle shell, as it quickly flowed into the shell, making it hard for Shi Yan and Zuo Shi to breathe.\u201cZuo Shi, I\u2019ll stay right here, you go into the living room right now and call both of our grandpas over! Now!\u201d Shi Yan was dazed for a moment, then shouted.\u201cOkay!\u201dZuo Shi was also stunned by the change to the turtle shell, so she didn\u2019t dare to hesitate. Her tall figure shook for a second and she disappeared from Shi Yan\u2019s view.Shi Yan\u2019s expression was serious, his eyes steadily fixed upon the turtle shell.After staring at the turtle shell for a while, Shi Yan\u2019s heart skipped a beat, suddenly realizing the strange conditions of the turtle shell was as if it wanted someone to put their hand in.As soon as the thought surfaced in his mind, Shi Yan could not resist, and wanted to place his hand onto the turtle shell.Yet, right after his hand reached out, he realized what he was doing.\u201cNo, this turtle shell belongs to Zuo Shi, I shouldn\u2019t be the one to do it.\u201dThinking this, Shi Yan stopped, took a deep breath, and he made himself take a few steps away from the turtle shell, waiting patiently.After a short moment, Zuo Shi, Zuo Xu, and Shi Jian rushed to the room, and the three surrounded the turtle shell, watching the continuously shifting turtle shell.\u201cSo this is what happened\u2026\u201d Shi Yan explained the situation briefly, and then said, \u201cThe hand print that\u2019s shown on the turtle shell should be the key to opening it. Just place your hand onto it and you should be able find out the secret of the turtle shell. Since it was Little Shi who brought it, I\u2019m not going to mess with it.\u201d\u201cCould it be dangerous?\u201d Zuo Xu\u2019s wondered aloud. At this moment, he was a little unsure of what to do.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Shi Yan shook his head, and he hesitated for a second, then stated his thoughts, \u201cThe reason why I called you guys over was because I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s dangerous or not. Since you\u2019re all here, even if the turtle shell turns out to be dangerous, you\u2019ll be able to stop it.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re saying that we can give it a try?\u201d Zuo Xu\u2019s eyes brightened. \u2018Dragon Turtle Armor\u2019 and \u2018Basalt Scriptures\u2019 were obviously connected to secret treasures and martial skills, so no wonder they grabbed Zuo Xu\u2019s interest.\u201cOf course we can give it a try.\u201d Shi Yan smirked, and said lightly, \u201cGrandpa Zuo, if you\u2019re worried about Xiao Shi, I can do it for her, how\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201dZuo Shi heard what Shi Yan said, and without asking for Zuo Xu\u2019s opinion, held out her glistening hand and pressed it into the deep indent on the turtle shell.\u201cBoom!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA low, exploding sound came from the inside of the turtle shell.Five thin needles shot out and embedded themselves into Zuo Shi\u2019s five fingers that were placed into the indent.Bright red blood immediately dripped out of Zuo Shi\u2019s fingers. Like rubies, the blood rolled around in the indent as if it was solid, and was finally absorbed by the turtle shell.Bright green light suddenly burst out from the turtle shell, and the blazing green light was blinding to everyone\u2019s eyes.Strange ancient symbols formed by the green light suddenly flew out, went along Zuo Shi\u2019s arm, and it flew straight into her head.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Whether The Zuo family could rise to power in the future, and whether they could hold their status in the business league, was directly connected to how strong Zuo Shi became!If Zuo Shi were to become strong, the Zuo family would keep their powerful influence. If she was weak, the Zuo family might decline.There were countless families whose rise and falls were tied to an important figure. A family had to have a powerful central figure in order to keep their remarkable position.The reason why Beiming Shang put Yin Kui and Jiu Shan close to Beiming Ce\u2019s side, was to prevent any mishaps that may happen to Beiming Ce before he became powerful. Their main objective was the future prosperity of the family.Shi Yan looked indifferent, and at this moment, he was secretly observing Zuo Xu\u2019s reaction.Through the slight change in Zuo Xu\u2019s expression, he realized that Zuo Xu really did see Zuo Shi as the most important treasure of the Zuo family. He also realized just how much importance a future strong figure holds to these elders!\u2026A strange green symbol flew out of the turtle shell, and disappeared into Zuo Shi\u2019s body.Zuo Shi\u2019s eyes were now closed, and there was a thin layer of green light covering her delicate face.Tiny little spots of light jumped across Zuo Shi\u2019s face, like lively fireflies, passing their thoughts to Zuo Shi.Zuo Xu\u2019s expression changed, and nearly exclaimed out loud. He instinctively wanted to step forward and protect Zuo Shi, afraid that she might be in danger.\u201cStop!\u201dShi Yan stepped forward suddenly and held back Zuo Xu, and spoke lightly, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Grandpa Zuo, you shouldn\u2019t be too tense.\u201dZuo Xu stared for a second, then looked at Shi Yan in surprise, \u201cAre you sure it\u2019s okay?\u201d\u201cYes, nothing will happen to her!\u201d Shi Yan nodded with certainty, \u201cThe little strange lights in the turtle shell should be a type of memory communication. If I guessed correctly, it could be the way to cultivate the Basalt Scriptures, so you don\u2019t need to worry, this is just a memory transfer.\u201dWhen Shi Yan obtained [Rampage] from the Blood Vein Ring, the scenery was quite similar.At that time, there was also many memory lights flowing out of the Blood Vein Ring, drilling into his mind, forming the memory imprint in his head.After having that experience, and looking at Zuo Shi now, his heart settled down.\u201cBrat, don\u2019t speak nonsense, this is very serious!\u201d Shi Jian shouted with a straight face.Shi Jian was also unsure, he was scared that Shi Yan\u2019s careless plans might cause harm to Zuo Shi. If that happens, the Shi family and the Zuo family could turn against each other!Ever since the Zuo family was connected to Chi Xiao because of Zuo Shi, they secretly began to have what it takes to compete with the Beiming family. To the Shi family, having such a strong ally could only be to their benefit, no matter if it\u2019s against the Beiming family, or the Mo family.Shi Jian doesn\u2019t want to become enemies with the Zuo family.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, Little Shi will definitely be fine, you can relax.\u201d Shi Yan said, and comforted Zuo Xu, \u201cCongratulations Grandpa Zuo, this time Zuo Shi will surely gain a great benefit, you can get ready to giggle.\u201d\u201cYou brat.\u201d After hearing his words, Zuo Xu actually loosened up, and he laughed, \u201cIf it really turns out to be like what you said, I\u2019ll owe you a big favor little brat.\u201d\u201cGrandpa, you really do owe him a big favor.\u201dZuo Shi suddenly opened her eyes, and smiled, joyfully she said, \u201cThose strange lights are the cultivation info of the [Basalt Scriptures]. Now in my mind, I\u2019ve obtained the complete cultivation method of the [Basalt Scriptures].\u201d\u201cWhat level of Martial Skill?\u201d Zuo Xu impatiently asked, he was so excited he could jump.Shaking her head, Zuo Shi said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. All I got was the cultivation method of the [Basalt Scriptures], and it didn\u2019t say which level of Martial Skill it is.\u201d\u201cThe writing\u2019s on the turtle shell are very ancient! This should be a Martial Skill cultivated by prehistoric warriors. At that same time, their skills were not as meticulously ranked as ours are.\u201d Shi Yan smiled, and casually explained, \u201cBut the Martial Skills of that time are much more mysterious than the ones we have now. This time Xiao Shi really got lucky.\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dZuo Xu laughed, delightfully patted Shi Yan\u2019s shoulder, and said, \u201cYou little brat, I can\u2019t help but like you! The Shi family has such a clever boy as you. Why worry about rising to power in the future?\u201dShi Jian\u2019s eyes brightened, he glanced over at Zuo Shi. Thinking of something, his face brightened up into a smile.\u201cCrack crack crack!\u201dOnce Zuo Shi removed her hand from the turtle shell, it cracked open, separating into pieces of turtle armor.These turtle armor pieces turned very thin, and shone with a strange green light. One of the pieces showed the shape of a dragon head, and another piece had the shape of a dragon tail. They looked like a pair of shoulder armor, and were very strange.In the middle of the armor, there were three walnut-sized medicinal pills, shining with green light. These pills had a silly Dragon Turtle shape, with a dragon\u2019s head and turtle\u2019s body, as if it was alive.A refreshing medicinal aroma spread from the three pills. The scent was very strong. Just by breathing in a little bit, everyone suddenly felt alert.\u201cThese three are the Dragon Turtle Pill, especially made to go with the cultivation of the [Basalt Scriptures]. This set of armor is the Dragon Turtle Armor, supposedly it has very strong defense abilities.\u201d Zuo Shi reached to pick up the three Dragon Turtle Pills and pocketed all of them, and said, \u201cWhen cultivating the [Basalt Scriptures], I will need the Dragon Turtle Pills. Three of these are just enough to help me cultivate this skill.\u201dZuo Xu\u2019s expression brightened even more, and he clapped and laughed in excitement.It was Shi Jian who actually felt slightly low spirited. He saw Zuo Shi taking all of the Dragon Turtle Pills, pressing his lips into a line, he finally couldn\u2019t help but murmur, \u201cShi Yan helped too\u2026\u201d\u201cHe can have the Dragon Turtle Armor.\u201d Zuo Shi lightly kicked the set of armor on the ground, adorably she furrowed her brows, and chuckled, \u201cI don\u2019t want to wear this heavy-ass Turtle Shell! Take it as you please.\u201dShi Jian jolted, and impatiently stared at Shi Yan, urging him to take the Dragon Turtle Armor.\u201cIs it okay to do that? Everything is a full set.\u201d Zuo Xu clenched his teeth, looking reluctant. Although he liked Shi Yan, he still didn\u2019t want to give away the Dragon Turtle Armor.Shi Yan stood still and shook his head, \u201cI don\u2019t want it, the Shi family\u2019s Martial Spirit specializes in defense, I don\u2019t need to suffer with this heavy set of Turtle Armor.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d Shi Jian was upset, he stomped and shouted, \u201cUngrateful!\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want it, but can\u2019t you give it to someone else? Stupid!\u201d Shi Jian cursed in his mind.\u201cBoy! I like you!\u201d Zuo Xu laughed, and wiggled his eyebrows at Shi Jian, \u201cIt\u2019s not that I\u2019m unwilling to give it up, but Shi Yan himself rejected the offer. Now you can\u2019t blame me for this.\u201d He said, and immediately picked up the pieces of turtle shell, his smile becoming even wider.\u201cGrandpa, if you were to wear this Dragon Turtle Armor I bet you would look like a big old turtle, do you want to try it on?\u201d Zuo Shi chuckled.\u201cYes, the girl is right, Brother Zuo, why not try it on?\u201d Shi Jian said with great pleasure, and secretly felt delighted.\u201cDisrespectful! You brat, what kind of nonsense are you talking about?\u201d Zuo Xu\u2019s face turned dark, he glared at Zuo Shi, \u201cIf you keep bullshitting like that, next time I\u2019m not going to pick you up from Cloud Mountain, and you can die from boredom at Chi Xiao\u2019s place!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t do it again.\u201d Zuo Shi stuck out her tongue, and chickened out.\u201cCough cough, Brother, alright then, we should get going.\u201d Zuo Xu smilingly looked at Shi Jian, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, people from our family are going to keep watch by the Dark Forest. If there\u2019s any news on Karu, I\u2019ll send people to tell you. Same thing with you guys, communicate with us once something comes up.\u201d\u201cOf course, sigh, I can\u2019t believe a figure as little as Master Karu can steal the treasure map of Mu Xun. Now Misty Pavilion has another piece, whoever is able to get both pieces of the map would be able to open the \u2018Gate of Heaven\u2019 with no difficulty, it\u2019s really unfortunate\u2026\u201d Shi Jian\u2019s expression was full of lament.\u201cMaster Karu?\u201dShi Yan furrowed his brows and whispered, he thought for a second, then asked, \u201cThat Karu guy, was he a Level 5 Mortality alchemist?\u201d\u201cHmm, you know about Master Karu?\u201d Zuo Xu was curious.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIs he important?\u201d Shi Yan didn\u2019t answer the question, and asked in response.\u201cHe\u2019s not important. However, the treasure map indicating the \u2018Gate of Heaven\u2019 that\u2019s on him, is extremely important!\u201d Zuo Xu said.\u201cI killed him a long time ago, and that treasure map, hmm, just happens to be in my hands.\u201d\u201cWhat?!\u201dZuo Xu, Shi Jian, and Zuo Shi all opened their eyes wide, simultaneously they exclaimed out loud.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It\u2019s fire, water and wear proof; basically indestructible.\u201d\u201cTell me in detail about what happened between you and Karu. And how many people know about this?\u201d Shi Jian looked rigid as he took a deep breath, but he couldn\u2019t hide the happiness in his eyes.\u201cYou, weirdo, are really strange.\u201d Zuo Shi\u2019s beautiful eyes were also focused on Shi Yan. She was becoming more interested in him.\u201cWell, this is the thing\u2026\u201dShi Yan noticed the seriousness of it after seeing Shi Jian and Zuo Xu\u2019s reaction, therefore, he quickly explained how he got that picture and how he escaped from the ancient cave.\u201cSo the Mo family knows about it too?\u201dZuo Xu\u2019s face changed. After a pause, he sneered, \u201cNo wonder the people from the Mo family are still lingering in Silent Town. They must be searching for you.\u201d\u201cThe Mo family!\u201dShi Jian grunted and said angrily, \u201cThank goodness Shi Yan is fine. If he was hurt by them, I would destroy Mo Tuo even by sacrificing myself! The Mo family has done too many evil things! They are going to look down upon the Shi family if we don\u2019t teach them a lesson soon.\u201d\u201cMu Yu Die and Di Yalan were taken away by Beiming Ce, and they don\u2019t know who you are?\u201d Deliberating for a while, Zuo Xu asked again.\u201cNo matter if it is Mu Yu Die, Di Yalan, or the people from the Mo family, no one knows who I am. I told the two girls that my name was Ding Yan.\u201d\u201cGood boy! Cautious enough! Or it would be very tough!\u201d Zuo Xu complimented.\u201cNow that we got this half of the picture, we should get the other half!\u201d Shi Jian said firmly to Zuo Xu, \u201cBrother Zuo, we can take the risk. Once we got the other half of the picture from the Misty Pavilion, we two families can open the Sky Gate and enter the God Area to search for treasures!\u201dNarrowing his eyes, which were blinking brightly, Zuo Xu sank deep into thought. He then said, \u201cThere are many experts in the Misty Pavilion. We have to make a good plan if we want to grab the picture from them.\u201dHe added after a pause, \u201cI will write a letter right away to Chi Xiao and let an eagle take it to Cloud Mountain. Chi Xiao is at the Sky Realm. We will be safer if he is here with us. After all, that old man Beiming Shang is eager for the picture too, and was already planning on getting it.\u201d\u201cGreat! We have larger chance of winning if Chi Xiao attends too!\u201d Shi Jian was joyful.Chi Xiao was Zuo Shi\u2019s teacher, and close to the Zuo family. As a Sky Realm Warrior, he could help a lot once he came to Tianyun City and allied with the two families.Zuo Xue didn\u2019t fear that Chi Xiao would keep the secret of the Sky Gate to himself. Though there were many treasures in the God Area, this was also accompanied with incredible dangers. The journey would be much more secure if a Sky Realm Warrior was with them.The most important thing was; Chi Xiao was an individual!However greedy he was, he couldn\u2019t possess everything in the God Area. On the contrary, a big family like the Beiming Family would take all the advantages.\u201cKid, you\u2019d better not attend this year\u2019s Martial Competition.\u201d Zuo Xu said after some deliberation, \u201cIf the Mo family recognizes your face, they would know that we already have half of the picture. Once the other half in the Misty Pavilion is stolen, they will know it was us. Then our two families would be assaulted by everybody.\u201d\u201cWell, this\u2026\u201d Shi Jian hesitated, but at last he nodded helplessly, \u201cHmm, for the Sky Gate\u2019s sake, we have to do this.\u201d\u201cNot exactly; He can attend the Martial Competition once he changes his appearance. No one from the Mo family has seen him before. Just change his face. Who would know that he was the boy who killed Karu.\u201d Zuo Shi suggested with a big smile, blinking her eyes.\u201cHey! Good idea!\u201d Shi Jian\u2019s eye\u2019s blinked. After examining Shi Yan for a while, he said, \u201cHis appearance has changed a lot in the past few months, and the people from the Mo family won\u2019t identify him if we put a little makeup to him.\u201d\u201cAnd you better take action during the Martial Competition. Han Zhong said the Misty Pavilion will also send some people to the competition. During the Competition, if you send some experts with Chi Xiao to the Misty Pavilion to steal the picture, you may not be suspected.\u201dShi Yan thought for a while, and also uttered his opinion.\u201cWe can take action in the middle of the Martial Competition\u2026\u201dZuo Xu mumbled something and then replied loudly, \u201cSounds great! Let\u2019s do it during the Martial Competition! We will also be present then, and no one will know it was us who robbed the Misty Pavilion! Hmm. Once Chi Xiao helps us, we will have an eighty percent possibility of getting the other half of that picture.\u201d\u201cWill Chi Xiao help us?\u201d Shi Jian was not sure.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. He definitely will. That old guy is very interested in the Sky Gate, thus he will come right away from Cloud Mountain as soon as he gets the news.\u201d Zuo Shi didn\u2019t worry at all, \u201cI know him too well. He is more curious than anyone about unknown things.\u201d\u201cThen it\u2019s fixed!\u201dShi Jian was assured, he then took the picture back from Zuo Xu, and put it into his own pocket happily, \u201cBrother Zuo, it\u2019s time for you to go back and make preparations. I\u2019ll be waiting for Chi Xiao to get the other half and come to complete mine. Hahahahaha!\u201d\u201cGreat!\u201d Zuo Xu nodded with satisfaction. He pulled Zuo Shi, \u201cLet\u2019s go, we should plan on it.\u201d\u201cLet me keep the picture. You should do nothing but training! I will find someone tomorrow to come and change your appearance. You should beat the Mo descendants hard!\u201d Shi Jian yelled.\u201cOkay.\u201d\u2026In the Mo family.Mo Tuo was strolling around the Thunder Palace with a rigid face. Beside him stood Mo Chaoge and Mo Yanyu.Mo Yanyu\u2019s pretty face was full of bitterness, so was Mo Chaoge, as he lowered his head.\u201cWhy can\u2019t we find him? Are you so useless? You can\u2019t even find a boy who has no background! We have so many people in every city! Do they only know how to waste our resources?\u201d Mo Tuo berated loudly. He pointed at Mo Chaoge and Mo Yanyu and yelled furiously, \u201cYou two! You have made so much trouble over such a small task! You are more like two rice buckets!\u201d[TL note: a \u2018rice bucket\u2019 is a chinese slang term for a useless person]\u201cFather, I\u2019ve sent people to search, and our people in Silent Town never took a single day off. But the Merchant Union is too vast. Who knows where that boy has gone? I did my best!\u201d\u201cUseless! All useless!\u201dMo Tuo cursed loudly for about ten minutes, before finally tiring, and he sighed helplessly, \u201cSeems I have to pay a visit to the Beiming family in person.\u201d\u201cFather, will we not receive anything if Beiming Shang knows about it?\u201d\u201cDo you have any better ideas?\u201d Mo Tuo looked so gloomy that he could swallow a monster, \u201cDo you think I want to? If you hadn\u2019t let that guy escape, I wouldn\u2019t need to visit Beiming Shang! Only Mu Yu Die knows who that young boy who killed Karu is! Only her! And only she may know where that boy is now. Do you think I would need to do this if you weren\u2019t so useless? Crap!\u201d\u201cFather, sorry, I was wrong.\u201d Mo Chaoge pleaded miserably. Then he turned and stared at Mo Yanyu hard, \u201cIf you can\u2019t win the Martial Competition, your father can\u2019t help you either!\u201dMo Yanyu nodded hastily with her face full of fear.\u2026In the Beiming family.At the centre of an artificial lake, there was a medium sized island covered with bamboo houses.In the garden of one of the bamboo houses, Mu Yu Die was sitting, feeling soft breeze on her skin and focusing her nimble fingers on the zither.The melodious zither melody rippled out slowly, attracting the birds on the clear lake, which gathered in the garden and forgot to leave.Di Yalan was in the training field of another garden. With a long sword in her hand which was splashing fire, she was training with a certain Martial Skill. Her hot figure was sending out intoxicating charisma in the sunlight.At the bank of the lake, every passing warrior would stop and stare, gazing at the island with eager eyes and a captured face.\u201cSister Lan, how is this Fire Cloud Sword?\u201d After a piece of music, Mu Yu Die approached Di Yalan with a big smile, \u201cThe Beiming family is known for its expertise in making weapons. Even in our Fire Empire, no one is better at it than the Beiming family.\u201d\u201cThe Fire Cloud Sword is a Mystery Level weapon, which can really help me release all of my strength when accompanied with the Fire Cloud Formula. More specifically, it can bear the fire from my Blue Magic Flame. It\u2019s really good.\u201d Di Yalan nodded. Apparently she was very satisfied with her new weapon.\u201cSo, are you still regretting coming with me?\u201d\u201cAlas\u2026\u201dDi Yalan shook her head and an image appeared in her mind again. She barely smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s useless to say these things now. I\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t see him again in this life. For revenge, for our family\u2019s prosperity, I have to do this. It\u2019s just\u2026 just can\u2019t\u2026\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t let it go?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cSometimes, I miss him too\u2026\u201dMu Yu Die let out a rare sigh as well, \u201cI feel that I owe him. But what could we do? We are only two girls who have lost their family and are saddled with a heavy mission. We have to be realistic and choose a powerful party. Or we will spend our whole life as a commoner and live a boring life.\u201d\u201cHe is not common at all! Sometimes I feel he is more horrifying than Beiming Ce! He won\u2019t be any worse off than others if he has the opportunity.\u201d\u201cUnluckily God didn\u2019t give him an opportunity. If he wants to succeed, he needs to advance step by step since he doesn\u2019t have a big family supporting him. We can\u2019t wait for too long.\u201d\u201cI know. That\u2019s why I\u2019m here with you, and not with him.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u201cMiss Mu, the family head has invited you and Miss Di Yalan to the Ice Pavilion. It is an important talk!\u201d At the centre of lake, a warrior was standing on a boat and shouting at the island.\u201cOkay.\u201d Mu Yu Die replied, as she frowned in puzzlement, \u201cWhy does he ask for us? We never made an appearance since we arrived at the Beiming family. This unexpected invitation is very strange\u2026\u201d\u201cHe is going to talk about your marriage with Beiming Ce?\u201d Di Yalan assumed.\u201cI won\u2019t marry Beiming Ce if they don\u2019t help me get my revenge!\u201d Mu Yu Die humphed coldly, \u201cI came to the Beiming family for their ability to help in my revenge. I feel nothing for Beiming Ce at all. Even if I fall in love with him in the future, I will leave sooner or later. Humph!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59 \u2013 The Situation SurgesBeiming family, Ice PavilionThe Ice Pavilion was made of Snow Ice Stones which were naturally gelid stones, even on a hot summer day, it would still be radiating freezing cold energy.The Ice Pavilion was made up of nine levels, each as tall as ten zhang. Overflowing with freezing air, it looked like a frigid ice mountain.[TL note: one zhang \u4e08 is approximately ten feet]This was where Beiming Shang usually trained at.The Beiming family\u2019s Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit, was cold in nature. Cultivating in an Ice Pavilion made of Snow Ice Stones was incredibly beneficial to the Beiming family\u2019s Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit.Usually, unless tempering himself with a secret treasure, Beiming Shang would never leave the Ice Pavilion.Everyone who wished to meet the Beiming family head had to endure the cold energy of the Ice Pavilion in order to see him.Beiming Shang would never take into account the feelings of others, he would only make others accommodate him.As you go up levels in the Ice Pavilion, the cold energy gets worse, even when the ordinary sons of the Beiming family come to visit, they would only wait at the third or fourth level. If they kept going up, it would be too much for their body to handle.Level six of the Ice Pavilion.In the middle of the erect ice pillars, sat the hulking Beiming Shang, his body was shrouded by lingering cold energy. On the ice pillars of the sixth level, strange ice flames were burning bright, making the freezing energy even more chilling to the bones.Mo Tuo furrowed his eyebrows, and stood across from Beiming Shang. Next to him was the handsome Beiming Ce.Yin Kui and Jiu San were like two ghastly shadows, sitting behind two ice pillars. They lowered their heads, as if already asleep.Lead by one of the warriors in the Ice Pavilion, Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan entered the sixth level of the Ice Pavilion.The cold energy of this level had twice the strength of the fifth level!The two girls took one step into the sixth level, and their delicate bodies shook, as if stepping into an ice pit, while their limbs began to slowly stiffen.\u201cYou\u2019re here.\u201d Beiming Ce stepped forward, and shot a meaningful glance at Mu Yu Die, \u201cThis is my grandpa, and this\u2026 is the head of the Mo family,\u201dMu Yu Die and Di Yalan\u2019s faces simultaneously changed, the two of them looked at Mo Tuo, as their expressions became stiff as stone.The death of Luo Hao and Hu Long was described very clearly. Aside from the intervention of Bernard and the Crescent Emissaries of the Dark World, there were also strikes of lightning from the sky.Afterwards the two girls had seen Mo Chaoge, they knew that Mo Chaoge definitely had something to do with Luo Hao\u2019s death.Unfortunately the Mo family held a great amount of power in the Merchant Union, and they also had connections with the Beiming family. When Beiming Ce simply shouted at Mo Chaoge to go away, he clearly didn\u2019t want to get into a difficult situation with the Mo family, and he had no intention of speaking out for the girls.Now they suddenly encountered the head of the Mo family with the Beiming family, Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan felt displeased. However, in front of Beiming Shang, there was nothing they could really do, so they only sulked in secrecy.\u201cNice to see you Grandpa Shang.\u201d Together Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan bowed to Beiming Shang, purposely ignoring Mo Tuo.Mo Tuo looked as usual, with a slight smile on his lips, as if he didn\u2019t mind the disregard at all.\u201cI heard the two of you were in the Dark Forest, you stayed with some boy for a while? I want to discuss certain things about this boy, would you happen to know his background?\u201d Beiming Shang lightly nodded, his long thin eyes expressionless, and asked straight to the point.Mu Yu Die\u2019s heart shuddered, she hesitated, then said, \u201cOnly an insignificant little warrior, how did Grandpa Shang come to know about such a person?\u201d\u201cHe has something I want.\u201d Beiming Shang furrowed his eyebrows, and said: \u201cDo you know where he comes from?\u201dShaking her head, Mu Yu Die responded, \u201cI don\u2019t know, we met him along the road. We only travelled together because we were afraid of the beasts killing people. As for this person\u2019s background, I have no idea. All I know is that his name is Ding Yan, I think he\u2019s some ordinary warrior from the merchant union.\u201d\u201cDing Yan\u2026\u201d Beiming Shang nodded, then paused for a moment and said, \u201cDo you know which city he is from, or which region he goes around?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Mu Yu Die shook her head again.Beiming Shang suddenly became silent, after a moment, he spoke faintly, \u201cOkay, there\u2019s nothing else. In some time, the Martial Competition is going to be held. You two and Ce should go and watch. If you stay here all the time, I think you all will get bored. Your grandpa and I had some friendship back in the day, and now that he\u2019s gone, of course I will take care of you. Don\u2019t worry, the people of the Dark World can\u2019t touch you here in the Merchant Union.\u201d\u201cThank you, Grandpa Shang.\u201d Mu Yu Die\u2019s eyes moistened, her voice sobbing lightly, \u201cWhenever I think of what happened to our family, I want to burn those people alive! Hundreds of people in the Mu family, all slaughtered in one night, Grandpa Shang, you have to help me!\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t rush such things, we\u2019ll talk about it later.\u201d Beiming Shang nodded, waving his hand as he said, \u201cYou can go rest, this level is too cold, with your capability it will be too hard to bear.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Without further ado, Mu Yu Die bowed and lightly pulled on Di Yalan\u2019s clothes. The two exited together.\u201cCould that girl have hidden the truth?\u201d After the girls left, Mo Tuo spoke with furrowed brows: \u201cWith only a name, it would be very difficult to search.\u201d\u201cCe, what do you think?\u201d Beiming Shang looked at Beiming Ce.\u201cDoesn\u2019t look like she\u2019s lying, I can keep asking her some other time. Since the other fragment is still at Misty Pavilion, we don\u2019t need to rush\u201d Beiming Ce responded.Beiming Shang nodded, and said, \u201cOkay, you keep an eye on those two girls, remember don\u2019t get manipulated, I don\u2019t want you to become someone else\u2019s weapon. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cI know, Grandpa.\u201d Beiming Ce smiled.\u201cBrother Mo, you don\u2019t need to be so anxious, I\u2019ll notify the Shi and Zuo families, and let them both look for Ding Yan. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll use my name to search for him, you won\u2019t get involved.\u201d Beiming Shang said unyieldingly, \u201cTogether with the five great families of the Merchant Union, I do not believe that we can\u2019t find a mere commoner! Humph. Remember, send someone to bring that brat\u2019s portrait. As long as he still lives, there\u2019s no way he can hide.\u201d\u201cOkay, then I will leave now.\u201d Mo Tuo nodded, and left without any further ado.\u201cCe, keep an eye on Zuo Shi from the Zuo family. Now that she has connections with Chi Xiao, if you can take Zuo Shi as your wife, it will be much less troublesome for us.\u201d After Mo Tuo left, Beiming Shang glanced over at Beiming Ce, and said, \u201cThat girl\u2019s natural gifts are quite extraordinary, and she\u2019s also Zuo Xu\u2019s little sweetheart, quite a capricious one. If you can rein her in, that old man Zuo Xu won\u2019t be able to do a thing, they\u2019ll be bound to the Beiming family.\u201d\u201cNo need to worry, one at a time.\u201d Beiming Ce said with confidence.Nodding, Beiming Ce continued, \u201cThat Mu Yu Die girl is also quite talented, but although her Musical Martial Spirit is strong, it\u2019s not of much assistance to the Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit of our Beiming family. However, that Di Yalan has the Blue Martial Flame Martial Spirit, it could be complementary to our family\u2019s Martial Spirit, so you have to keep a close watch on that girl, and if you can, bond with her. She might be able to give birth to an outstanding offspring of our Beiming family.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry Grandpa, the things I have my eye on can never escape from me.\u201d\u201cAlright, since they entered into our Beiming family, they can\u2019t even think about leaving.\u201d\u2026The Zuo family.Zuo Xu was in his room, leisurely drinking tea. Behind him, a dark shadow suddenly knelt down and reported, \u201cBeiming Shang sent a messenger, he requested us to find a boy named \u2018Ding Yan\u2019, saying that he stole something from the Beiming family, and they will give us five Mystery Level weapons for the boy.\u201d\u201cFive Mystery Level weapons.\u201d Zuo Xu took a sip of tea, and smiled, \u201cBeiming Shang is as stingy as usual, using five Mystery Level weapons he wants to get the other half of the map to the \u2018Gate of Heaven\u2019, he\u2019s sure playing it well.\u201d\u201cMaster, what should we do?\u201d\u201cSearch for him, of course. Let our people spread the word in some cities, but don\u2019t put too much effort into it, just finding some random dude named \u2018Ding Yan\u2019 will do, just so that guy doesn\u2019t get suspicious.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u2026The Shi family.Shi Jian received the same message, he held the envelope and sneered: \u201cSo Mo Tuo has found Beiming Shang. Hmph! Luckily that little brat Shi Yan told me the truth, or else I\u2019d be in the dark about this too. Beiming Shang oh Beiming Shang, you would never believe that Ding Yan is Shi Yan. Asking me to search him out, hehe, then I\u2019ll sure help him look!\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d Han Feng said faintly.\u201cFind a few people connected to the Mo family, make them mute, just say that they\u2019re all called Ding Yan and send them to the Beiming family.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u2026The Beiming, Zuo, Mo, Shi, and Ling families, as the Merchant Union\u2019s five great families, started to both openly and secretly search for a guy named \u2018Ding Yan\u2019 in the nearby cities.In a short time, the name \u2018Ding Yan\u2019 quickly became widespread.Many of those named \u2018Ding Yan\u2019 were doomed, all taken by the five families. And many who were not named \u2018Ding Yan\u2019 but were related to the Mo family, also encountered unexpected calamities, they were beaten and crippled, forcibly muted, and escorted to the Beiming family.Since the Martial Competition was about to start, the warriors in the Merchant Union had been grinding their fists, and those warriors from far away, were traveling thousands of miles to come to the Martial Competition.What was funny was that a lot of these warriors who came, because their name was \u2018Ding Yan\u2019, were immediately taken by the five families.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter one night, \u2018Ding Yan\u2019 became the street villain, and everyone wanted to beat him up.And the person who started all of this, Shi Yan, had been staying in the Shi family\u2019s heavy weight room, jabbing his hand into a metal sand bag tens of thousands of times a day.\u201cPuchi!\u201dShi Yan jabbed his five fingers straight in, arm deep, into the centre of the metal sand bag. He pulled out his arm, and those five fingers actually glinted with strange chilly light, as if they were blades made of steel, which was very frightening.\u201cHmm, the Martial Competition is about to start, and the storm from the Misty Pavilion is coming. My [Finger Gun], is finally having some success.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 60 \u2013 The Endless SeaAt the Misty Pavilion.The Misty Pavilion was a mysterious power which primarily held auctions, selling all sorts of rare training materials for warriors. It had opened its only shop in Tianyun City in the Merchant Union.It was rumoured that the Misty Pavilion was supported by warriors from the Endless Sea. The Endless Sea, a vast ocean, was located to the east of the Merchant Union.There were thousands of islands in the Endless Sea, which were scattered like stars. Some large islands were even vaster than the Fire Empire and the God-blessed Empire combined.Warriors from the Endless Sea rarely came to the Grace Mainland, for they looked for higher things. There were numerous experts there, and they all had a powerful family or power behind them.It was said that there were even expert warriors who were above the Spirit Realm.On that day, at the entrance of the Misty Pavilion, stood the manager. Ku Luo was a warrior of the First Sky of the Nirvana Realm, and had been in charge of the Misty Pavilion for many years.For many people, Ku Luo was the master of the Misty Pavilion.But today, Ku Luo was standing with several important members of the Misty Pavilion, seeming to wait for someone important.Time passed.It was dusk. Though Ku Luo had waited for a whole day, he didn\u2019t show any impatience on his face.\u201cFather, how long do we have to wait? Who are we waiting for?\u201d Ku Luo\u2019s only son Ku Ban grunted in discontent, \u201cThis guy is too pretentious! He is making us wait for so long!\u201d\u201cKid, you were born in the Merchant Union, so you have no idea how big the world is! Don\u2019t think that the Beiming Family is the biggest family oin the mainland. Compared to the prominent families in the Endless Sea, the Beiming Family is nothing!\u201dKu Luo stared at his son and said coldly, \u201cI am from the Endless Sea. And it was the Xia Family who sent me here to take charge of the Misty Pavilion. The person we are waiting for is Xia Xinyan of the Xia Family. She is my master. If it weren\u2019t for the fragmented map of the Sky Gate, she wouldn\u2019t even spend her precious time visiting us from thousands of miles away.\u201d\u201cFather, aren\u2019t we at the center of the Grace Mainland?\u201d Ku Ban was stunned. After a long while, he asked in surprise.\u201cHere? The center of the Grace Mainland?\u201d Ku Luo sneered as he shook his head, \u201cThe Fire Empire, the God-blessed Empire, and the Merchant Union are on the outskirts of the Grace Mainland. How would they be at the center of it? Remember! The Grace Mainland is far more vast than what you imagined. Well, the so-called experts here, are merely considered low level warriors outside this country!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Ku Ban couldn\u2019t believe what he heard.As the sun faded gradually, the moon climbed up the dark sky. Under the bright moonlight, Ku Ban was still waiting patiently.At midnight, three shadows appeared from the long street.Under the red lanterns on the road side, the three shadows looked like hideous ghosts, swaying spookily.\u201cHere they are! Listen, don\u2019t utter a single word!\u201d Ku Luo announced in a low voice.The person in the lead was a slim woman wrapped up by a black gown and a broad bamboo hat, so her face could not be seen.Beside that woman were two giant men who were about two meters tall, and looked exactly the same; they were twins.The two huge tower-like men had dark skin and a masculine aura, but they moved really fast, giving the impression that they weighed nothing.\u201cMiss, you have finally arrived.\u201d Ku Luo bowed and said respectfully, \u201cKu Luo has been waiting for you for a long time.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s get inside first.\u201dA melodious voice came from under the bamboo hat. That woman didn\u2019t waste one more word, as her slim body passed Ku Luo, and directly headed inside the Misty Pavilion. It looked like she could be the master wherever she was!\u201cYes, Miss.\u201d Ku Luo nodded with a smile, then he followed her at her pace, feeling relieved.In the inner garden of the Misty Pavilion, in a quiet room.The women in the black gown sat down on the seat at the center of the room, which was prepared for the Master. After the two huge men found their positions to stand behind her, she waved her hands, \u201cKu Luo stays here. Everyone else is dismissed.\u201d\u201cLeave us alone.\u201d Ku Luo announced to those men loudly, and specially stared at his son, Ku Ban.Ku Luo was the manager of the Misty Pavilion, so after his announcement, they quickly left the room.Ku Luo entered and gave a salute to the woman, then quickly took out an account book from his chest pocket, handing it to the woman with two hands, \u201cThis is the accounts for the past ten-some years. Miss, please check.\u201d\u201cWell, put it away. I haven\u2019t come for the accounts.\u201dThen she leisurely waved her hand and took off the bamboo hat. An extremely beautiful face appeared. She frowned with her pretty eyebrows, and said softly, \u201cShow me the fragmented map.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ku Luo immediately took out the fragmented map of the Sky Gate from underneath his clothes and handed it to her respectfully.Xia Xinyan picked the map with her jade like fingers, glanced at it once, and nodded softly, \u201cGood, from its old look it seems to be authentic.\u201d\u201cMiss, there are also three Nutrition Pills and one Blood Magical Crystal, which were sent by the Immortal Yang Family through Empty Strategy. They said it\u2019s for you.\u201dKu Luo took out those things mentioned before and handed them respectfully to Xia Xinyan, \u201cMiss, it\u2019s enough for you to handle the situation here with the three Nutrition Pills. You will be heavily hurt every time you operate the Incarnation Martial Spirit; but with these, you will be fine.\u201d\u201cWell, the Yang Family is literally generous, and pretentious!\u201d Xia grunted, \u201cThe Misty Pavilion doesn\u2019t belong to the Xia Family exclusively. The Yang Family is also a heavy stockholder. They don\u2019t even send a man here but three Nutrition Pills? Haha. They trust me so much.\u201dAs she spoke, Xia Xinyan put away the three red longan-sized Nutrition Pills. Stroking the Blood Magical Crystal, she asked, \u201cAnd what about this Blood Magical Crystal?\u201d\u201cThe Yang Family has requested you to look for a person. The family head of the Yang Family, Yang Qingdi, said his grandson Yang Hai is still alive in this place, as he perceived through the [Blood Search] skill. So he has asked you to find him. The three Nutrition Pills are payment.\u201d Ku Luo lowered his head as he answered in a low voice, not daring to look at her.\u201cWhat?\u201d Xia Xinyan exclaimed in indignation, and she said coldly, \u201cHehe, I wondered why they were they so generous! They want me to do this difficult thing for them for three Nutrition Pills? Too bossy!\u201dKu Luo kept his head lowered, not daring to say anything.\u201cMiss, fifty years ago, Yang Qingdi and his experts entered the Fourth Demon Area, where his son, Yang Xiao, died in a battle. Moreover, Yang Xiao\u2019s wife gave birth to an infant there. After Yang Qingdi killed a Demon King in the Fourth Demon Area, the other three Demon Kings allied to chase him out, and his daughter-in-law died soon after. Yang Qingdi assumed he was about to die, so he broke the space with [Blood Escape] skill and threw that infant out of the Fourth Demon Area.\u201dOne of the huge men explained with his rusty voice.\u201cAnd then?\u201d Xia Xinyan frowned slightly, and asked nonchalantly.That huge man paused, thought for a while, and continued, \u201cAfter he threw out that infant, Yang Qingdi stayed in the \u2018Fourth Demon Area\u2019 for another twenty years, encircled by the other three Demon Kings. But luckily he escaped and came out of the Fourth Demon Area alive, though he was badly hurt. Recently, Yang Qingdi finished his secret training and came out as a Spirit Realm Warrior. He had saved one drop of blood from the infant when he threw him out of the Fourth Demon Area, so he perceived through [Blood Search] skill that his grandson is in the Merchant Union. That\u2019s why he sent the three Nutrition Pills as the payment. He cares about the Yang descendent.\u201d\u201cThe three Demon Kings in the Fourth Demon Area seemed to have a big plan recently, so I guess Yang Qingdi has been too busy to search for the infant in person.\u201d The other huge man added.\u201cYes, they sent a message that one of the three Shura Kings, Xiao Hanyi, had already set off from the Immortal Island with fifty Shura escorts. They will arrive in at most one month, and hope that you could find the infant before they arrive.\u201d Ku Luo said slowly with deference.\u201cShura King, Xiao Hanyi! Fifty Shura escorts!\u201d Xia Xinyan sneered, \u201cSeems like Yang Qingdi really cares about that infant!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe Yang Family is so domineering in the Endless Sea, thus they offended a lot of people. For the past few years, they were busy fighting with the Fourth Demon Area and lost a lot of descendents who possess the Immortal Martial Spirit. That infant is Yang Qingdi\u2019s direct grandson left by Yang Xiao, sure enough, he takes it to heart.\u201d One of the huge men responded.\u201cKu Luo, from now on, I will take charge of the Misty Pavilion, and you will go look for his grandson discreetly. The Shura King, Xiao Hanyi is coming. I can\u2019t take the three Nutrition Pills if we can\u2019t find Yang Hai before he arrives. You understand?\u201d Xia Xinyan looked at Ku Luo indifferently.\u201cYes, I got it.\u201d Ku Luo nodded.\u201cI will keep the Blood Magical Crystal. After you find all those men called Yang Hai, bring them to the Misty Pavilion and then with Yang Qingdi\u2019s Blood Magical Crystal, we will know who is the Yang Hai we want.\u201d Xia Xinyan said with an indifferent face as she stroked the Blood Magical Crystal.\u201cOkay, I will go right away.\u201d Ku Luo bowed and left, while sighing to himself bitterly, \u201cThe five big families are looking for Ding Yan, and I have to go look for Yang Hai. It\u2019s so boisterous in the Merchant Union.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But the Misty Pavilion was not as outrageous in their search, they adopted the bribing method. As long as you can prove that your name is Yang Hai, you can come to the Misty Pavilion to receive a thousand purple crystal coins.Since the Martial Competition was about to be held, there was an endless stream of people in the Merchant Union. Although the actions of the five families and the Misty Pavilion confused many, most people still came for the Martial Competition.Quickly, the restaurants and inns of Tianyun City were packed.The warriors and mercenaries that come from the Dark Forest, Dead Swamp and Cloud Mountain were all hardened fighters. Even in Tianyun City they were restless, often causing conflicts, and killing each other.Be it day or night, there were more than enough fighting warriors in Tianyun City. Every morning, the cleaning staff would often find new corpses in the ditches.Three more days remained until the Martial Competition.Early in the morning, Zuo Xu was resting with his eyes closed, when he heard Zuo Shi speaking outside, \u201cHuh, old man you came?\u201d\u201cHow many times did I tell you, don\u2019t call me old man in front of others!\u201d From outside came Chi Xiao\u2019s frustrated voice.\u201cYou are just a little old man, it\u2019s an old habit, I can\u2019t change it.\u201d Zuo Shi wasn\u2019t afraid of him, as she laughed outside the doors.Zuo Xu was suddenly excited as he suddenly stood up and rushed out to greet the guest. \u201cYou\u2019re finally here!\u201d he thought.\u2026The Shi familyIn the heavy weights room stood a wrinkled old crone. She held a paintbrush, and was putting a few heavy marks on Shi Yan\u2019s brows.Shi Yan stood in silence, carefully watching the old crone\u2019s actions.After a long while, the crone took back her hand. She stared closely at Shi Yan for a while, and then nodded in satisfaction, \u201cDuring my visit every day, I have been changing his appearance slightly each time. Even those who are close to him wouldn\u2019t notice such slow changes. His appearance now is much different from how it was a month ago, and nobody would be able to recognize him.\u201dShi Yan\u2019s skin was a lot darker now, his brows thick, and his figure looked quite a bit sturdier.From how he had looked before, he now looked less fierce and more rugged. Whether it be appearance or temperament, there was a significant change.Especially after coming back from the Dark Forest, he had grown taller and became more robust. Plus he got fixed up by the disguise artist. Compared with the time when he was in the Dark Forest, he truly looked like another person.Shi Jian stared at Shi Yan for a moment, then nodded and said, \u201cGood, there should be no problem.\u201dShi Yan observed himself in the mirror, and was also quite satisfied: \u201cAlright, hmm, isn\u2019t the Martial Competition starting?\u201d\u201cThree more days, so you don\u2019t need to train hard these three days, just relax a little bit.\u201d Shi Jian finally let go, but suddenly he thought of something, and then rebuked with a straight face, \u201cRelaxing does not mean fooling around! Don\u2019t think for a moment that I don\u2019t know what you and Han Zhong did together! Hmph, if you waste your energy on women, I\u2019ll skin you alive!\u201d\u201cStop nagging.\u201d Shi Yan looked annoyed and said, \u201cI\u2019ll go take a shower, then go drink a little with Han Zhong. Is that okay with you?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u2026Spring PavilionThis was a very well-known restaurant in Tianyun city. Here not only was the food delicious, but they had the famous \u2018Flame\u2019 wine that was popular throughout the Merchant Union.Aside from that, the Spring Pavilion was also close to the Moon Lake. Sitting in the open third floor of the Spring Pavilion, eating delicacies, drinking fine wine, and enjoying the beautiful view, was a great pleasure in life.If you could hold a beauty in your arms at the same time, then that would be called perfection.However, not just anyone can get to the third floor of the Spring Pavilion. Even if you were rich enough, without status, you\u2019d only be allowed up to the second floor.The third floor of the Spring Pavilion was usually reserved for guests from the five families. Only those from the five families could head straight to third floor when they came in, normal merchants would not have such an honor.Han Zhong led Shi Yan to the Spring Pavilion. After they arrived, a cute receptionist immediately came over smiling, \u201cMister Han, please step upstairs.\u201dHan Zhong squinted as his eyes circled the girl, and complimented: \u201cXiao Feng, your thing got a lot bigger!\u201d Then he stopped, and lasciviously stared at the girl\u2019s breasts.\u201cYou\u2019re the worst, Mister Han, always staring at that place.\u201d The girl smiled shyly, having a style of her own. She pointed up and said: \u201cThere are other guests up there, they are the young masters and mistresses of the Mo and Ling families. Mister Han, you should be prepared.\u201d\u201cNo worries.\u201d Han Zhong smiled, and stopped teasing the girl. He grabbed Shi Yan and brought him straight up the third floor.\u201cHey!\u201d A tall lad wearing a navy warrior outfit sat at a good seat on the third floor, and squinted at Han Zhong, and sneered, \u201cHere I was thinking who could it be, and it\u2019s the Shi family\u2019s dog.\u201dThat seat faces right towards the Moon Lake. There sat four people, two men and two women, all looking quite attractive.One of the group looked aloof and arrogant, and that was Mo Yanyu, but she wasn\u2019t looking this way, her motionless eyes was only staring into the sun-blazed Moon Lake, and looked like she was in a daze.\u201cOh, so these are the worms of the Mo family, how fucking unlucky.\u201d Han Zhong shook his head, stopped paying attention to them, and dragged Shi Yan to find a good spot. He yelled, \u201cMr. Long! Bring four jugs of \u2018Flame\u2019, and a nice course of dishes, hurry up.\u201d\u201cComing right up!\u201d A hearty voice answered from the second floor.At this time, Mo Yanyu, who was staring at the Moon Lake looked like she finally woke up. She turned her head around and glanced at Han Zhong and Shi Yan. She threw a look of disdain, then turned her head back and continued staring at the lake water. Nobody knew what she was thinking.Across from Mo Yanyu sat a handsome young man.The young man had an amiable smile. While talking to one young master of the Mo family, he was also secretly paying attention to Mo Yanyu, as if trying to grab her attention with his words. However he was unsuccessful.\u201cShao Feng, Xiao Yu was recently punished by my father, she\u2019s been in a bad mood lately, don\u2019t mind her.\u201d Mo Zhan toasted him, and then said, \u201cDon\u2019t care about him, let us drink more. The Martial Competition is about to start, so these few days we can slack off a bit, treat yourself well.\u201d\u201cBrother Zhan, when have you mistreated yourself?\u201d Ling Yue Yue shrewdly looked at Mo Zhan, with a cunning smile on her face \u201cI heard that Brother Zhan is great at going to those \u2018Pleasure Quarters\u2019! When would you enrich me a little on your experience?\u201d\u201cCough cough cough!\u201d Mo Zhan choked on his wine, and said awkwardly, \u201cYue Yue, trust me, I\u2019m innocent! I\u2019m not familiar with those places! That was the only time I went was because I was tricked, Yue Yue, you have to trust me!\u201d\u201cTeehee, who knows if you\u2019re lying or not.\u201d Ling Yue Yue was still smiling, but her eyes showed some other expression, \u201cA while ago, I was praised by my sisters. They said my fianc\u00e9 already has dozens of mistresses before marrying me; they said I would have so many maids to serve me in the future. Oh, just thinking of it makes me happy.\u201d\u201cCough cough cough!\u201dMo Zhan\u2019s expression was a little stiff, his face darkened and said, \u201cWho is talking bad about me behind my back? If I find out who it is, I will skin him alive!\u201d\u201cAlright, Yue Yue!\u201d Ling Shao Feng glared at his sister, \u201cBrother Zhan is a man, sometimes treating people with courtesy is inevitable. I trust Brother Zhan\u2019s conduct!\u201d\u201cOf course you\u2019d trust him.\u201d Ling Yue Yue lightly snorted, and murmured quietly, \u201cEveryone knows that you guys always go there together, of course you would trust him.\u201dUpon hearing this, Mo Yanyu glanced over at Ling Shao Feng, and her brows slightly furrowed, as if she was irritated. However she didn\u2019t say much, and again turned her head towards Moon Lake, her expression growing colder.\u201cI\u2019ll deal with you when we get home!\u201dLing Shao Feng glared at Ling Yue Yue, as he anxiously changed the topic, and said to Mo Zhan, \u201cBrother Zhan, that Shi Tianyun is also in the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm, he\u2019s even better than Shi Tianke, and I heard he has been training very hard lately. At the last Martial Competition, he didn\u2019t show up, but this time he\u2019ll definitely be there. Even though you won against Shi Tianke that time, you shouldn\u2019t let down your guard this time around.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, those guys from the third generation of the Shi family can\u2019t be placed in my eyes!\u201d Mo Zhan smiled with arrogance, coldly glancing over to where Han Zhong was, and said, \u201cJust watch, this year\u2019s Martial Competition, I\u2019ll cripple whoever comes in my way!\u201d\u201cYeah, sure enough, Brother Zhan has the heroic spirit!\u201d Ling Shao Feng laughed. He held up his cup and said, \u201cCome on, Brother Zhan, cheers!\u201d\u2026\u201cThose four over there, are Ling Shao Feng, Ling Yue Yue, Mo Zhan and Mo Yanyu. They are all the leaders of the third generations of the Mo and Ling families, and they might become your opponents in the Martial Competition. Among them, Ling Shao Feng and Mo Yanyu are engaged, and that Mo Zhan and Ling Yue Yue are also engaged. Mo Zhan and Ling Shao Feng are both at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm. Mo Yanyu is slightly worse, but still has a cultivation of the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm.\u201dHan Zhong lowered his voice, and explained the situation to Shi Yan. He paused and then said, \u201cBut, the one you should least underestimate is that Ling Yue Yue! We got the news a while ago that this girl broke through to the Human Realm half a year ago, and now she\u2019s the strongest one in the third generation of the Ling family. This year\u2019s Martial Competition, the Ling family might arrange to have Ling Yue Yue fight against Zuo Shi. Apparently, to make Ling Yue Yue win, the Ling family have spent a hell lot on her, not only buying the most expensive medicines, but they also gave her a few secret treasures to defend herself. Zuo Shi might be in a lot of trouble this time.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNot necessarily.\u201d Shi Yan smiled, casually glancing at Ling Yue Yue, and spoke in a low voice, \u201cZuo Shi is much more fierce than she is, just watch, she\u2019s going to lose really badly.\u201dZuo Shi had now obtained the Dragon Turtle Pills and the [Basalt Scriptures], plus the \u2018Dragon Turtle Armor\u2019, which Han Zhong did not know about.With all these things to rely on, Zuo Shi had a nine out of ten chance of winning, and besides, Zuo Shi\u2019s realm was a little higher than Ling Yue Yue\u2019s.\u201cThat kid, what are you talking about?\u201dAt this moment, Ling Yue Yue suddenly stood up and sneered, \u201cAre you saying that I\u2019m not as good as Zuo Shi? You think I didn\u2019t hear that? I\u2019m telling you, my hearing is clear as ever! Talking about people behind their backs, people from the Shi family, are you all this dirty?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You will definitely lose in the Martial Competition. You are doomed.\u201d Shi Yan glanced at Ling Yue Yue indifferently, without getting angry.\u201cI\u2019m doomed?\u201d Ling Yue Yue was furious as she sneered, \u201cWho do you think you are? Are you a prophet?\u201dShi Yan shook his head and didn\u2019t talk to her again, showing no care for her.With a rigid face, Mo Zhan stood up from the table and strode toward Shi Yan. As he approached him, he yelled with his head high, \u201cKid, who are you? I haven\u2019t seen you, you are from the Shi Family too? You want to be ruined before the Martial Competition?\u201dShi Yan turned serious as he lowered his voice and asked Han Zhong, \u201cCan I kill him?\u201dHan Zhong was totally frightened as he quivered suddenly, and asked in haste, \u201cBrother Yan, what are you trying to do?\u201dThough he had been with Shi Yan for a long time, they had just sought out \u2018entertainment\u2019 together. He only knew that Shi Yan recent got Profound Qi and reached the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm.Yet he hadn\u2019t seen him fight with others, so he had absolutely no idea how Shi Yan would react to the provocation.The fact that Shi Yan wanted to kill for such a trivial dispute totally frightened Han Zhong.He had never thought that this young master, who was the best at \u2018entertaining\u2019, would be so brutal in front of his enemies!Shi Yan glanced at the man, suggesting that he was going to take action.\u201cNooo!\u201d Han Zhong hurried to stop him with a face full of terror. He thought to himself, \u201cThough you are at the Nascent Realm, your opponent is an expert too! If you fight bluntly, I can\u2019t help you either. But if you get hurt and can\u2019t attend the Martial Competition, the family head will kill me.\u201d\u201cNo?\u201d\u201cDefinitely no!\u201d Seeing Shi Yan not persuaded, Han Zhong quickly explained, \u201cThey are the hopes of the Mo Family and the Ling Family. If they were killed, the two families will sacrifice everything to get revenge! It will be tough as hell then. So cool down.\u201d\u201cThen, can I cripple him?\u201dHan Zhong froze, rolled his eyes and smiled bitterly, \u201cBrother Yan, please! If you really want to, then you can vent your frustrations in the Martial Competition. Who knows, you might also win back a mine for the Shi Family. But for now, please don\u2019t be impulsive.\u201d\u201cFine.\u201dShi Yan didn\u2019t talk anymore, instead he stared at Mo Zhan in front of him, and shouted loudly, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cKid, who are you?\u201d After he approached, Mo Zhan didn\u2019t fight, instead he gazed at Shi Yan coldly, \u201cYou made my fianc\u00e9 unhappy! Don\u2019t blame me for my rudeness if you don\u2019t tell me who you are!\u201dSeeing Mo Zhan there, Ling Yue Yue sat down at the table, looking in this direction with cold eyes and felt surprised.Her hearing was superior to others, hence even though Shi Yan and Han Zhong lowered their voices, she was still able to hear the words \u201ckill\u201d and \u201ccripple\u201d.Who on earth is that arrogant guy?Ling Yue Yue was bewildered. Since she didn\u2019t know who Shi Yan was, she decided to be cautious. As the Martial Competition was around the corner, she guessed that he was some expert invited by the Shi Family, so she couldn\u2019t do anything now.\u201cYoung masters, please don\u2019t fight in my Spring Pavilion. I beg you, ok?\u201dJust then, the stout Manager Long of the Spring Pavilion bowed, as he came up to the third floor. Behind him, several pretty young girls were holding the dishes and wine ordered by Han Zhong.\u201cYou will know who I am in the Martial Competition.\u201d Shi Yan didn\u2019t bother to respond to him, but waved at those shy girls and said, \u201cCome here! Display my dishes. I want to have a good meal!\u201dThe girls were frightened. They didn\u2019t dare walk up but pleadingly stared at Manager Long.After Manager Long made an eye contact to them, the girls hurried to serve the dishes on the table and dashed away immediately like frightened birds.Shi Yan looked indifferent as he opened a jar of wine by himself, filled his wine cup, and drank it up at once. He began to eat, not paying any attention to Mo Zhan who was still standing beside him.\u201cYoung Master Mo, it\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve been to the Spring Pavilion. I am always good to you. Please, don\u2019t make a fuss, okay?\u201d Manager Long bowed as he persuaded Mo Zhan with a miserable face.\u201cWell, Manager Long. For you, I won\u2019t fight today.\u201d Mo Zhan grunted and sneered at Shi Yan, who was eating happily, \u201cKid, be prepared in the Competition!\u201d\u201cOkay, I can\u2019t wait.\u201d Without raising his head, Shi Yan kept drinking, and filled another cup for Han Zhong, \u201cCome on, Old Han, let\u2019s drink.\u201dMo Zhan stared at Shi Yan angrily and then left for his own table.Mo Yanyu was paying attention in this direction for quite some time. Her bright eyes wandered over Shi Yan curiously. After Mo Zhan came back, she withdrew her gaze and looked to the Green Moon Lake, forgetting the episode entirely.\u201cDeng! Deng! Deng!\u201dJust then, heavy footsteps sounded from the stairs, which was followed by Beiming Ce\u2019s voice, \u201cXiao Die, Yalan, the courses in the Spring Pavilion are famous in Tianyun City. You two should have a good taste this time. Well, the Flame Wine is strong, but it\u2019s really different. You can\u2019t afford to miss it!\u201dThen Beiming Ce showed up, closely followed by Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan.\u201cWell, it seems I must have a try at the Flame Wine. Hehe, I can just drink a little.\u201d Mu Yu Die was in a white dress, which made her look extraordinarily fresh. She came up slowly to the third floor.Di Yalan was behind her, looking a little gloomy, seemingly lost in her worries.Shi Yan, who was drinking, showed a panicked expression on his face as he heard that voice, but quickly went back to normal. Without taking a look at them, he kept drinking with Han Zhong with his head lowered.Han Zhong was astonished as he saw Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan, for he was a little worried Shi Yan would make trouble again.\u201cOh, customers here?\u201d Beiming Ce glanced over the two tables, and continued indifferently, \u201cAnd all acquaintances.\u201dThe four people including Ling Shao Feng and Mo Zhan became perturbed, as they saw Beiming Ce. They barely smiled and nodded to Beiming Ce as a greeting.Ling Shao Feng and Mo Zhan also glanced over Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan secretly after they nodded at Beiming Ce, and showed a surprised face at the same time.Han Zhong stood up, and nodded at Beiming Ce as well with a smile, \u201cYou are not occupied today, Young Master Ce? Hehe, I heard that you rarely stepped out of your home recently?\u201d\u201cWell, two beauties came and brightened my home, I found it hard to leave.\u201d Beiming Ce smiled slightly, took a look at Shi Yan who was still drinking, and turned to Mu Yu Die, \u201cLet\u2019s take a seat first.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Ce, this way please!\u201d Manager Long dashed up suddenly with a fat face full of smiles, as he chose a seat for Beiming Ce and shouted downstairs, \u201cOld Guo, Young Master Ce is here today! Prepare the best dishes and wine! Be careful!\u201d\u201cHaha! Needless to say!\u201d Loud laughing sounds came from downstairs.Smiles went up from Beiming Ce\u2019s mouth, as apparently, he was satisfied with Manager Long\u2019s attitude. He said softly, \u201cWell, good enough Manager Long. Mind your own business now, I can take care of myself.\u201d\u201cGreat! Well I will cook one or two dishes for you personally. But I haven\u2019t cooked for a long time, so please forgive me if it doesn\u2019t taste good.\u201d Manager Long laughed.\u201cI\u2019m too lucky.\u201d Beiming Ce laughed as well, \u201cI\u2019m so flattered to have dishes made by you! No matter how it tastes, I will eat it up gratefully.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m too flattered. So I will go downstairs now?\u201d Manager Long bowed and asked.\u201cSure.\u201dManager Long then bowed to leave.\u2026\u201cI\u2019ve finished.\u201d Mo Yanyu stood up suddenly.Ling Shao Feng and Mo Zhan looked at each other and stood up as well, so did Ling Yue Yue. The three followed Mo Yanyu and went toward the stairs.Before he left, Mo Zhan greeted Beiming Ce, \u201cBrother Ce, take your time. I\u2019m afraid we have to leave first.\u201d\u201cYeah, take care.\u201d Beiming Ce turned to him casually and continued to chat with Mu Yu Die.Immediately, the four people from the Mo Family and the Ling Family disappeared from the third floor.While drinking, Shi Yan was also listening to Beiming Ce and Mu Yu Die chatting, and got a little annoyed. So he yelled at Han Zhong, \u201cOld Han, I\u2019m done. You?\u201d\u201cLong ago.\u201d Han Zhong knew he was unhappy, so he stood up immediately, and said to Beiming Ce, \u201cYoung Master Ce, we got to go.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Beiming Ce responded indifferently without raising his head, and continued to talk with Mu Yu Die.\u201cLet\u2019s leave.\u201d Han Zhong pulled Shi Yan, then they walked toward the stairs.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBefore he went down stairs, Shi Yan paused at the corner, glanced over at Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan coldly, and then disappeared.Beiming Ce didn\u2019t feel that glance as he sat with his back to Shi Yan. Neither did Mu Yu Die, for she was talking with Beiming Ce.Only Di Yalan raised her head randomly, and happened to see Shi Yan\u2019s glance. Out of it, she saw some familiar coldness, and scorn.Di Yalan was surprised and dumbstruck.After a very long time, she shook her head softly and sighed to herself: Why am I so stupid? How could that guy be him? Except the eyes, they resemble by nothing! They were two different people! What am I thinking about? What\u2019s wrong with me?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63 \u2013 The Martial CompetitionTianyun City, the God Stone Square.A small hill-sized, diamond-shaped meteorite stood tall in the God Stone Square. More than half of the meteorite was sunk deep into the ground, and the part that was visible was hundreds of meters tall, making it look very magnificent.Legends say that this was a piece of the meteorite that fell from the sky thousands of years ago. It crashed right here, where at the time there was no Tianyun City, but merely a piece of wasteland.It was said that after the meteorite fell from the sky, in the beginning, every night under the glistening moonlight, the meteorite would emit a bright silver light. Later on, this silver light started to dim day by day, and in the last ten years, the meteorite has never shone, appearing just like a normal rock.The people of the Merchant Union treated this meteorite as a God Stone, and established Tianyun City around it. (\u5929\u9668 means sky meteor).It has been many years since then, and now Tianyun City has become a big city and the center of the Merchant Union.However, even though the meteorite stopped shining in silver brilliance, for the warriors of the Merchant Union, it was a blessing from God, and thus the meteorite was zealously treated as a God Stone.The God Stone Square was also built from that meteorite.In the Merchant Union, many couples would come to the God Stone Square and make their vows, with the God Stone as a holy witness to their love.Every Martial Competition in the Merchant Union, was held in the God Stone Square.On this day in the God Stone Square, there was an endless stream of crowds. Outside the Square there were countless vendors, many of whom were warriors selling mostly items that were associated with cultivation.In the God Stone SquareIn front of that enormous meteorite were sixteen battle arenas. Each one was about a hundred square meters and was made out of solid green iron. Even warriors in the Human Realm wouldn\u2019t be able to break it using all their strength.Around these sixteen battle arenas stood five tall stone towers.One of the towers was fifty meters tall, while the other four were forty meters tall. These five towers were equally spaced a hundred meters apart in distance, and on those towers stood the people from the five families, who were able to view all sixteen arenas below.On one of the stone towers, Shi Yan stood next to Shi Jian, condescendingly looking down upon all the participants around the God Stone Square who came to compete in the Martial Competition.This stone tower belonged to the Shi family, which was forty meters tall. The other four were for the Beiming, Ling, Zuo and Mo families.The stone towers belonging to the Ling, Zuo, and Mo families were also forty meters tall, just like that of the Shi family. However, the Beiming family was an exception. Their tower was fifty meters high, a whole lot taller than the other four families\u2019 towers.Just from the height of the stone towers, it could be seen that the Beiming family held an absolutely strong position in the Merchant Union!This was the first day of the Martial Competition.The direct descendents of the Shi family; Shi Jian, Shi Tie, and Shi Dang, were all on the stone tower by this time.The Han Brothers, Han Feng and Han Zhong, were also in the stone tower, plus a few other strangers that Shi Yan didn\u2019t know. Through Han Zhong\u2019s introductions, Shi Yan learned that those were the loyal subordinates of the Shi family. They usually worked in the city, but were called here because of the Martial Competition.However, Yang Hai was not in the stone tower, and that was because Yang Hai did not practice Martial Arts. When the Martial Art masters of the other cities were called here, Yang Hai had to go and take charge in case any problems come up while the Martial Competition was being held.Every year\u2019s Martial Competition was separated into five categories: Elementary, Nascent, Human, Disaster, and Earth. However, in the category of Earth Realm there would usually only be one figurehead.Usually, even the warriors who were unaffiliated to any power, when they managed to reach the Earth Realm, they would have certainly gained their own cultivation opportunities. It was unlikely for them to covet the prizes given by the five families.An Earth Realm warrior, whether in the Merchant Union, the Fire Empire, or the God-blessed Empire, would be considered a master.Such warriors wouldn\u2019t need to compete in the Martial Competition to obtain a nice cultivation environment. They can just go to any powerful force to become a dedicated warrior.Even if an Earth Realm warrior didn\u2019t join any power, the major forces would still reach out their arm, hoping to recruit the warrior.Because of this, even though the Martial Competition set a competing category for Earth Realm warriors, but the warriors that actually came to participate, were nearly nonexistent.Even the warriors who reached the Disaster Realm would rarely come to the Martial Competition. Every year, there would only be a few warriors that would show up.The ones who really came for the Martial Competition were mostly at the Elementary, Nascent, or Human Realms.These three kinds of warriors with lower capabilities were the majority, as they often couldn\u2019t find their own cultivation opportunities. Therefore they would have to participate in the Martial Competition in the hope to win some precious cultivation materials, or to obtain a nice position in one of the five families.The Martial Competition usually lasted for five days.The first four days were generally for the warriors who came for the prizes. These people would be watched by the five families. Throughout the four days of fighting, the families would choose their favorite warriors and reach out to them.The last day, however, would be the highlight of the Martial Competition.On this day, the five families would send their best dedicated warriors and descendents to go compete with the masters of the other families. The five families would test each other\u2019s power on the last day of the Martial Competition.This day, was also the day when the five families would show their strength to others!And on this day, the fighting was often accompanied with the enormous conflicts of interests and profits, and earth-shaking gambles would often happen.Mines, commercial streets, treasures, and even bizarre Martial Skills could become the stakes of the five families!Just one Martial Competition, could lead to one family gaining the most extravagant riches, and could also reduce a family\u2019s savings to nothing. The last day of the competition would become a topic that people would talk about for years to come.This day, the masters from the different families would expose their true capabilities, showing rare Martial Spirits. Also in the intense fighting, different secret treasures might also show up.Most warriors who came from the outside were also here for the last day of the Martial Competition.From the fights on last day of the Martial Competition, they could find out the difference between them and the warriors of the five families. Through watching the fierce battles, they could understand their own inadequacies, and find the ways to improve their standards and capabilities.And they might even be able to raise their own strength through the battles from the Martial Competition.This was why the Martial Competition attracted so many people!Shi Yan stood on the stone tower serenely, condescendingly looking down upon the arenas and the many warriors who came to participate.Two hundred meters away on the tower of the Beiming family, two beautiful figures followed Beiming Ce up the high tower.On the high tower, Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan stood side-by-side with Beiming Ce. Together they were looking over all of the arenas.Mu Yu Die wore a white dress, her hair flying in the wind. On the tall tower, her beautiful posture made her look like a fairy on the mainland.Di Yalan was still in that crimson armor, her hot body was visible underneath the coverage of that armor made her figure look very seductive. Only her eyes looked troubled.From two hundred meters away, Shi Yan slightly raised his head and shot a glance at the two girls, secretly smiling in disdain.\u201cKid, these four days you better carefully watch. You lack experience, so you need to watch how the others fight; don\u2019t just mess around.\u201d As Shi Jian caught him staring at the two girls on the Beiming family\u2019s tower, he snorted as he became displeased, \u201cWomen are everywhere, and with what you have, what woman can\u2019t you get in the future. Don\u2019t get distracted before you become strong!\u201d\u201cYes, I know what I\u2019m doing.\u201d Shi Yan nodded.\u201cBrother, Kro from the Misty Pavilion has come to see you.\u201d Shi Tie, who stood near the staircase entrance of the stone tower, suddenly shouted.\u201cKro?\u201d Surprise flashed across Shi Jian\u2019s face. He blanked out for a second, but then nodded: \u201cInvite him up.\u201d\u201cGrandpa, how\u2019s the situation at the Misty Pavilion?\u201d Shi Yan lowered his voice, and secretly asked.Shi Jian slightly nodded and said, \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t care much about this, don\u2019t mention it next time, understand?\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Looking at his expression, Shi Yan knew that Zuo Xu and him must have sorted out all the details. But as Han Feng and all the dedicated warriors were on the tower, Shi Yan was confused as to whether the Shi family sent anyone to help Chi Xiao at the Misty Pavilion or not.Kro came up with a smile as he calmly walked next to Shi Jian, and said, \u201cHead of the Shi family, I have come to request help from you. I\u2019m wondering where your son Yang Hai is right now, I want to invite him to the Misty Pavilion. Is that alright?\u201d\u201cYang Hai?\u201d Shi Jian\u2019s expression darkened as he snorted, but said in confusion, \u201cThe Misty Pavilion has been trying to find people named Yang Hai everywhere, what are you trying to do?\u201d\u201cA friend of mine has come from the Endless Sea. Her older relative lost an infant a very long time ago. The infant is called Yang Hai, and so they requested me to look around for him. Thus I ask for your help, Master Shi.\u201dShi Jian\u2019s heart skipped a beat and his eyes flashed with a strange unknown expression. After quite a while he finally shook his head and responded, \u201cYang Hai is not in Tianyun city right now, because I called many people back for the Martial Competition, Yang Hai is has been taking charge in another city, this\u2026 we\u2019ll talk about this some other time.\u201d\u201cSure, as long as you\u2019d remember, Master Shi.\u201d Kro didn\u2019t urge deliberately, and smiled, \u201cWhen he comes back, please allow him to come to the Misty Pavilion, Master Shi, haha, don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t let him run all this way for nothing.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Shi Jian indifferently nodded.\u201cThen I will take my leave.\u201d Kro didn\u2019t stay for long, and after the issues were negotiated, he left straightaway.\u2014Melodious and soothing music came from the tower of the Beiming family.The heart-warming sound of nature immediately rang throughout every corner of God Stone Square. Mu Yu Die sat crossed-legged on the stone tower of the Beiming family, absorbed in playing the zither.Many warriors who came to the Martial Competition, were attracted by this ethereal music, and their expression was full of fascination as they looked up at the Beiming family\u2019s stone tower.Next to Mu Yu Die was Beiming Ce, his expression full of pride, and the corner of his lips showed a trace disdain for all living things. He stood there and accepted the admiring and envious gazes from the many warriors.Mu Yu Die\u2019s music was like a mountain stream, flowing into the hearts of the warriors, as if cleansing their souls.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJust with one song, the warriors were mesmerized, their faces stunned.Then at this moment.Beiming Shang suddenly flew from the tall tower, his magnificent figure magically floated on the sky above the God Stone Square, like a God looking down on all human beings. He shouted, \u201cThe Martial Competition, officially starts!\u201d\u201cWalking in mid-air! Sky Realm warrior!\u201dMany warriors screamed out one by one, their expression in awe, shocked by the capabilities shown by Beiming Shang.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Streams of bizarre light exploded on the field one after another, as if magical snakes were shuttling above the competition field.The participants were performing all sorts of rare Martial Skills, and some even startled those people from the five big families.In the high building of the Shi family.Standing next to Shi Jian, Shi Yan\u2019s eyes were glistening, as he cast his eyes upon those fighting warriors one by one.As the head of the family, Shi Jian was standing beside him and explaining for him.As long as Shi Yan showed some interest in one competition area, Shi Jian would soon elaborate on the strength of the two parties, their Martial Skill levels, their competing strategies, and also teaching him the best way to win the fight.In the stone building, Shi Tie was also illustrating the situation on the competition field, explaining the various Martial Skills, their advantages and disadvantages, the opponent\u2019s weaknesses, and how to beat them.As the leaders of the Shi family, Shi Jian and Shi Tie rarely talked on a normal day, but today they almost never stopped talking.Shi Yang and Shi Tianxiao were also standing in a corner, while Shi Yang was pointing the warriors in the competition field to Shi Tianxiao, the latter nodding and asking accordingly.Some ministers who came back from other cities, and those experts from their family branches, were all observing the stone building quietly. As they saw Shi Jian explaining to Shi Yan whole-heartedly, they were very confused.\u201cOld Feng, who is that kid? Why does family head treat him so specially?\u201d Standing beside Han Feng, Ku Long observed them for a long while, and finally couldn\u2019t help but ask him about Shi Yan.Ku Long was one of the ministers of the Shi family who was at the First Sky of the Nirvana Realm. Since he was garrisoned in another city, he didn\u2019t know much about the latest news on Shi Yan. Seeing Shi Jian lay so much stress on Shi Yan, he was quite confused.\u201cThat is Young Master Yan.\u201d Han Feng looked indifferent, as he glanced at Ku Long and said, \u201cThe one who used to be always absent from home and busy studying those historic relics. Yeah, Yang Hai and Miss Qing\u2019s son.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible!\u201dKu Long was totally shocked, as he asked in surprise, \u201cThat Young Master never trained in Martial Arts, did he? As far as I know, he was more attracted to those odd things and never set his eyes upon Martial Arts. Why would the family head pay attention to him?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Yan is no longer the person he used to be.\u201dHan Feng narrowed his eyes, and said casually, \u201cYou\u2019d better try your best if Young Master Yan asks you to do something. It would in your best interests.\u201d Though Han Feng knew a lot, he talked little. He wouldn\u2019t have said anything if Ku Long wasn\u2019t his good friend.Ku Long knew Han Feng\u2019s personality. He was surprised at Han Feng\u2019s speech, and after a long silence, he nodded softly.He was still confused, but realizing that Shi Yan was favored by the family head, he decided to try and get close to Shi Yan.Apart from Ku Long, many other ministers and Shi branch families were also secretly discussing about Shi Yan, as they were all confused why the family head paid so much attention to that unknown boy.Soon Shi Yan was known to all. This boy, who hadn\u2019t been treated specially for seventeen years, was now at the center of the Shi family.\u201cGrandpa, did Xiao Yan become a warrior for real? And has he reached the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm?\u201d Seeing Shi Jian favor Shi Yan so much, Shi Tianke, who was standing next to Shi Tie, finally asked.Shi Tie took a glimpse at them, and nodded, \u201cIt is great, Shi Yan is amazing. He has reached the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm now. He may participate in the martial Competition this year.\u201dShi Tie had been focusing on his three grandsons recently, so he didn\u2019t pay much attention to Shi Yan. He merely knew that Shi Yan had gained the family Martial Spirit and reached the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm.However, he didn\u2019t know that Shi Yan had also gained the Immortal Martial Spirit, so he still considered that Shi Jian was putting way too much energy into him.But he didn\u2019t place any further thought into it. After all, Shi Yan was his brother\u2019s direct grandson, and Shi Tianxiao was useless. Now that Shi Yan reached the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm, he thought it was reasonable for Shi Jian to be over excited. He was not aware that Shi Yan possessed twin Martial Spirits, and that his Petrification Martial Spirit had advanced to the second stage.\u201cTianyun, you should fight against Mo Zhan this year. Last time Tianke lost to him, so your fight will be crucial this time! Or they would assume that we don\u2019t have any talented descendents among the third generation!\u201d Shi Tie said to Shi Tianyun who was standing beside him.\u201cYes, I will beat Mo Zhan for sure.\u201d Shi Tianyun said with certainty.Shi Tianyun was only nineteen years old, but he had reached the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm. He was just like a newborn calf who wasn\u2019t afraid of a tiger.Before Shi Yan was noticed, he was the pride of the Shi family, and Shi Jian would guide him in person now and then. But ever since Shi Yan came back, Shi Jian seldom visited him.Shi Yan spent seventeen years discovering ancient languages, and seldom stayed at home. He didn\u2019t train in Martial Arts, so there was no conflict between him and other people, thus Shi Tianyun never cared about him.However, Shi Yan stood out now, and Shi Jian\u2019s attitude had shifted too much, which made Shi Tianyun a little uncomfortable.Yet, the Shi family had the formidable outside opponents, such as the Mo family and the Ling family, so the Shi family members, including Shi Jian and Shi Tie, stuck together and got along well. The second generation also allied to defend against the Mo family. Shi Tianyun and Shi Tianxiao often played around.Thus, although Shi Tianyun was a little uncomfortable, he didn\u2019t show a strong reaction. But he had made up his mind to have a perfect performance in the competition, and secure his position as the hope of the Shi family.\u201cEh?\u201d Shi Jian suddenly cried, as he was talking to Shi Yan, and his eyes brightened and quickly looked over to someone. Something had suddenly occurred beside the competition field.\u201cWho came?\u201d Shi Yan frowned, walked up and looked in the direction of Shi Jian.A troop of seven people were walking in slowly from outside the God Stone Square. The man in lead looked around fifty, with a hawk nose, gloomy face, delicate cap, and a silver gown, on the left shoulder of which was embroided five types of herbs.\u201cLevel-5 Soul Alchemist!\u201d Shi Yan identified him only by a quick glimpse.Just like Martial Skills, alchemists were divided into five levels: Mortality, Mystery, Soul, Royalty, and Divinity.Karu, who was killed by Shi Yan in the Dark Forest, was a mere Mortality Level alchemist, but was treasured by the Mo family. Now that a Soul level alchemist had appeared, he must be an influential one!\u201cThis is Karu\u2019s teacher, the Medicine King, Mu Xun.\u201d Shi Jian glanced over Shi Yan, \u201cHe is not only an alchemist of the Soul level, he is also a warrior of the Second Sky of the Nirvana Realm, and the Medicine Valley is a special institution too. Though it doesn\u2019t get involved in fights between various parties, it is closely connected to them.\u201dThe fact that Karu was killed by Shi Yan was known to only a few people. And now that Shi Yan had faked his appearance, fewer people knew his real identity. Shi Jian didn\u2019t worry that Mu Xun would recognize Shi Yan, so he sneered and gloated, \u201cWell, I guess Mu Xun came to look for his stolen fragmented map, and Karu entered the Dark Forest with people from the Mo family. Mu Xun will definitely ask Mo Tuo about that. Haha! This should be an interesting show!\u201d\u201cThe Medicine King, Mu Xun!\u201dThe warriors in the competition field soon recognized this foreign visitor, as they cried out in surprise, and cleared the way for him.Many other warriors squeezed their way forward and shouted crazily, \u201cMedicine King, I collected lots of herbs, please refine me a pill! Please!\u201dAs soon as the flock heard that, the competition field boiled with excitement. More and more people shouted, asking for Mu Xun\u2019s help.People\u2019s attention were drawn to Mu Xun at once, and no one set their eyes on the competition field anymore.On the buildings of the Beiming family, the Zuo family, the Ling family, and the Mo family, many couldn\u2019t sit still anymore. Lots of experts rushed down the buildings with their master\u2019s\u2019 permission and ran to Mu Xun to invite him to watch the competition in their building.Without Shi Jian\u2019s permission, Shi Tie also rushed down.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, the Medicine King Mu Xun was crowded by the core members from the five big families, whose faces were full of smiles, hoping Mu Xun would go with them.\u201cMu Xun will go to the Mo family. Hehe. But nothing good will happen.\u201d Shi Jian gloated.Just as expected.Ignoring Mo Chaoge, who was coming up to invite him, Mu Xun soon walked toward the Mo family building silently, with a rigid face.Mo Chaoge didn\u2019t dare be angry, and followed him smiling and bowing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His voice was not loud, but everyone in the God Stone Square heard him clearly.Standing on the stone tower of the Mo family, Mo Tuo was in total dismay.Being bluntly questioned in public by Mu Xun, Mo Tuo was embarrassed. He wanted to deal with him in private, but apparently Mu Xun was having different thoughts.Being pushed hard, Mo Tuo had to reply loudly, \u201cMr. Mu, Karu died long time ago. I also don\u2019t know who killed him.\u201dMu Xun stood proudly against the railing of the stone tower, and thus his figure could be easily seen once the warriors at the bottom of the tower raised their heads.\u201cDead?\u201dMu Xun sneered and said sarcastically, \u201cMo Family Head really has his methods! Knowing that my despicable student stole my treasure map, you invited him to visit the Merchant Union and killed him half way, and so you got the map. Now you pretend to know nothing! What a family head you are! Well, did you earn all the Mo family properties this way?\u201d\u201cHaha, the whole Merchant union knows Mo Family Head\u2019s methods.\u201dOn the tower of the Shi family, Shi Jian laughed loudly and gloated, \u201cMany of the Shi family properties were snatched under the Mo Family Head\u2019s tactics.\u201d\u201cShi Jian!\u201d Two hundred meters away, Mo Tuo stared at Shi Jian angrily, \u201cThis is none of your Shi family\u2019s business! Stop spouting nonsense!\u201dIgnoring him, Shi Jian continued, \u201cOf course it\u2019s none of our business. I was just stating the truth, don\u2019t be overly emotional, Mo Family Head.\u201dStanding aside Shi Jian, Shi Yan smiled secretly and for the first time, he felt this old man was interesting and knew how to strike a man when he was down.Not being able to do anything about Shi Jian or be mad at him, Mo Tuo could only smile to Mu Xun modestly and explained, \u201cI didn\u2019t know Karu had stolen your treasure map when we invited him to our home. And considering he is YOUR student, we sent people to pick him up. We really didn\u2019t know that! Mr. Mu, don\u2019t blame the Mo family.\u201d\u201cMistake?\u201d Mu Xun\u2019s face turned gloomier, and he sneered, \u201cYour Mo family would have sent people to pick him up if you hadn\u2019t known that he stole my treasure map? The Medicine Valley is thousands of miles away from the Merchant Union. Who would believe that you traveled so far just for Karu\u2019s second rate refining skill, but not for the treasure map? Humph!\u201dMo Tuo was helpless, as he explained, \u201cWell, it was for his skill.\u201d\u201cMo Family Head, I don\u2019t need any more excuses from you. I don\u2019t care if Karu died or not. Just return to me my treasure map and I will leave at once. I\u2019m not interested in stirring up any trouble.\u201d Mu Xun became impatient.\u201cThe treasure map is really not in my hands.\u201d\u201cSince you, the Mo Family Head, don\u2019t want to return that map, I have got nothing else to say.\u201d Mu Xun grunted and walked out, as he said coldly, \u201cThough we, the Medicine Valley, don\u2019t get involved in the power struggles in various countries, we won\u2019t be bullied as you like. Mo Family Head, you\u2019d better conduct yourself well.\u201dAt once, Mu Xun walked down the tower directly with his people.\u201cMr. Mu, you are welcome to visit the Shi family anytime! We understand everything you talked about.\u201d Shi Jian\u2019s voice came from his tower, the overtone of which could be understood by everyone.Walking down the Mo family building, Mu Xun looked over at Shi Jian and nodded, \u201cI believe we will have the opportunity to cooperate. Please don\u2019t turn me down if I ask for some help from the Shi family.\u201d\u201cI, Shi Jian, hate those who always play tricks. It would be an honor to work for Mr. Mu.\u201d Shi Jian laughed loudly and saluted with cupped hands.\u201cThank you, Shi Family Head.\u201d Mu Xun nodded and glanced up coldly at Mo Tuo, who had an ugly face, and left the God Stone Square with his people.On the God Stone Square, the competitions had paused for a long while. Only after Mu Xun left did they continued.The competition this day became more interesting after Mu Xun\u2019s unexpected visit.Soon after Mu Xun left, people started discussing noisily and soon learnt the whole story.As a result, a hint of scorn and loathing could be seen amongst the crowd whenever the Mo family was mentioned.Many of those who had planned to associate with the Mo family changed their mind, and thus the Mo family lost numerous potential experts.Ku Luo, the manager of the Misty Pavilion, was also in the competition arena. He saw the conflict between Mu Xun and Mo Tuo.Before the competition ended, Ku Luo secretly left for the Misty Pavilion, which was not far from the God Stone Square.\u2014At dusk.In a secluded room in the Misty Pavilion, Ku Luo bowed and elaborated the whole story to Xia Xinyan.After Ku Luo finished his speech, Xia Xinyan frowned and thought for a while, then said, \u201cIf it is as Mu Xun says, then the other piece of the fragmented map must be in Mo Tuo\u2019s hands. I came here for the Sky Gate, so I don\u2019t care who I have to cooperate with. Ku Luo, go to the Mo family tonight, and tell them we can share the map with them and work together to explore the Sky Gate.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201d Ku Luo nodded.\u201cShura King Xiao Hanyi will arrive in half a month, and you still haven\u2019t found the right guy. Hurry up.\u201d Xia Xinyan said casually.\u201cI will try my best!\u201d Ku Luo was a little astonished as he replied in awe, \u201cI\u2019ve sent people to other cities to search. I believe we will find him soon.\u201d\u201cGood. Off now.\u201d Xia Xinyan waved her hand casually.Ku Luo bowed away.\u2014That night.Ku Luo visited the Mo family alone, asking to meet Mo Tuo.Mo Tuo was too angry, but since Ku Luo came, he had to lift his spirit to meet him. After Ku Luo revealed his purpose, Mo Tuo shook his head with a bitter smile, \u201cThe treasure map is truly not in my hands. I can offer you nothing even if I want to cooperate with you.\u201d\u201cMo Family Head, my master wants to work with you sincerely. To open the Sky Gate we need the complete map. With our cooperation, we can take action at once. Please think about it!\u201d Ku Luo apparently didn\u2019t believe him as he turned serious. He guessed that Mo Tuo might already have a plan about the Misty Pavilion, so he got a little angry.\u201cIt is absolutely not in my hands. Don\u2019t believe Mu Xun.\u201d Mo Tuo didn\u2019t look happy either, so he talked in an unpleasant way, \u201cPlease leave now Mr. Ku Luo. I have to prepare for the Martial Competition. Please excuse me.\u201d\u2014At midnight, Ku Luo went back to the Misty Pavilion and told what Mo Tuo said to Xia Xinyan.\u201cThere are two halves of the treasure map, one of which is in my hand. Since the Mo family don\u2019t want to cooperate, they must want to possess it alone. I guess the Mo family will take action soon.\u201d Xia Xinyan\u2019s eyes looked cool as she added, \u201cI\u2019m waiting for the Mo family to grab it. They would not cooperate with us honestly, therefore we must teach them a lesson.\u201d\u201cMiss, how about we grab that map from the Mo family?\u201d One of the huge men behind Xia Xinyan asked.A murderous aura came from that huge man, which frightened Ku Luo a lot.\u201cNevermind, after all, this isn\u2019t our own home. Follow the rules. If all the five big families allied, it will be much more troublesome. However, when Shura King Xiao Hanyi arrives and the Mo family still doesn\u2019t step back, we will take action.\u201d Xia Xinyan observed indifferently.\u201cOkay.\u201d The huge man nodded, not saying any more.\u201cWell, Ku Luo, go and do your business. You can send out the message secretly that I have the other half of the map. And I will wait for them.\u201d Xia Xinyan smiled, \u201cWhoever comes to grab the map, must have the other half.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201d\u2014At deep night. At the Zuo Family.Zuo Xu and Chi Xiao were discussing in a secret room in a low voice.\u201cShadow has brought the message that the map isn\u2019t in Ku Luo\u2019s hand, but in another girl\u2019s hand in the Misty Pavilion. That girl popped up all of a sudden. No one knows who she is.\u201d Zuo Xu said.\u201cWait till the last day. I will go to the Misty Pavilion during the competition among the five big families. It\u2019s just a little girl. No big deal.\u201d Chi Xiao nodded and smiled bitterly, \u201cIt\u2019s so strange to fight against a little girl. Nevermind, I will leave one or two pieces of treasure to her as compensation.\u201d\u201cBut pay attention! Don\u2019t expose yourself. The map has been attracting so much attention that once you are exposed, it will be truly troublesome.\u201d\u201cOk, I got it.\u201d\u2014That night, in the secret rooms of the five families, many were discussing about what had happened in the daytime.In a secret room of the Shi family.Holding an envelope, Shi Jian showed a weird smile as he said to Han Feng, who was beside him, \u201cMu Xun is so quick that he sends a letter in one day. Hehe, now that Mu Xun is to take action against the Mo family, we need to do something to help him secretly, if not publicly.\u201d\u201cWhat does Mu Xun plan to do?\u201d\u201cHe wants to kidnap some people of the Mo family and threaten Mo Tuo. Hehe, his targets are just whom we want to give a lesson to.\u201d Shi Jian was very joyful, \u201cBrother Feng, assign someone to follow them and spill their trails to Mu Xun. Haha, I\u2019m excited to watch how Mo Tuo will react.\u201dThat fragmented map from Karu was right against his chest, so no matter how, Mo Tuo couldn\u2019t return it to Mu Xun. Those Mo family hostages would die for sure.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euImagining Mo Tuo\u2019s furious face, Shi Jian was very amused, as he said with a big smile, \u201cAlso, go and get me a jar of wine. I want to have a good drink.\u201d\u201cFamily head, all the delicate wine has been drunk by Young Master Yan. The rest is all ordinary wine.\u201d Han Feng lowered his head, as a shallow smile crossed his face.\u201cThat little bastard!\u201d Shi Yan patted the armrest and cursed in laughter, \u201cThat bastard is really audacious! How could he drink up my wine! I\u2019m gonna rip his skin if he doesn\u2019t have a good performance in the Martial Competition.\u201d\u201cWith his Petrification Martial Spirit at the second stage, no warrior of the Nascent Realm could beat him. It\u2019s almost fact that Young Master Yan will win the Competition! Definitely!\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s true.\u201d Shi Jian laughed loudly in delight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We will be sticking with \u2018Gate of Heaven\u2019 from now on.\u2014It was now the fourth day of the martial competition.This day, all the warriors who came to participate were fiercely fighting for the top three places.Every rank\u2019s first three places would have a certain Martial Skill, secret treasure, or cultivation material as prizes. As long as you can place in the first three, there\u2019s no way you would go home empty-handed.The five families were never stingy in giving prizes. They had prepared many Profound level Martial Skills and secret treasures as well as pills and cultivation materials that enhanced one\u2019s Profound Qi.On the morning of the fourth day, these lavish prizes were displayed on a round table in the middle of the arena, watched by specialized staff.The warriors were ecstatic upon seeing the prizes being displayed and were in full vigor to fight in the upcoming battles.By noon time, there were already two Nascent Realm warriors killed in the arena, and one at the Human Realm was crippled.According to the rules of the Martial Competition, when one side surrenders, the opposing party cannot continue the fight.Which was why as long as one wasn\u2019t too greedy, took what could be managed, and give up when the situation wasn\u2019t favourable, one would definitely live.The few warriors who were heavily injured or killed were all thinking that they could still keep fighting. They tried to turn the situation around when they were obviously at a disadvantage, that was why they had such miserable outcomes.On the Shi family\u2019s stone tower.There was a smile at the corner of Shi Jian\u2019s lips as he looked down on the arenas from high above, occasionally glancing at the Mo family\u2019s tower. Every time he would see Mo Tuo with a dark expression, like his son died or something.In the past three days, many important figures in the Mo family had all mysteriously disappeared one by one.Mo Tuo was full of anger, but due to the critical time of Martial Competition, he couldn\u2019t act arbitrarily. He knew exactly who\u2019s been doing this, but there was nothing he could do.The experts of the Mo family could only secretly try to find traces of Mu Xun\u2019s group, but unfortunately, they couldn\u2019t even find Mu Xun\u2019s shadow. And Mu Xun didn\u2019t send messengers either, so there was no way to negotiate.\u201cKid, tomorrow is the Martial Competition for the five families. After watching for four days have you gained anything?\u201d Shi Jian was in a great mood. He peered at Shi Yan, who was at his side, and spoke casually.\u201cGains?\u201d Shi Yan looked indifferent and nodded, \u201cI definitely gained some things, but I\u2019m only watching, so there\u2019s only a little to actually gain. Instead I would like to go on the battlefield myself and fight to the death. Only the things you comprehend on the verge of death can be considered the greatest riches.\u201dShi Jian was dazed. He stared at Shi Yan, and after quite a while he finally asked in astonishment, \u201cYou little brat! You cultivated to the Nascent Realm in such a short time, shouldn\u2019t you be lacking in battle experience? Why do I feel that you\u2019re already highly experienced? The insights on the verge of death are surely precious, but if you get killed, then all those insights would\u2019ve been useless.\u201dShi Yan grinned, but did not explain his words.\u201cOh?\u201dShi Jian suddenly exclaimed, his expression strange. He looked at the far away tower of the Mo family.Two hundred meters away, in the tower of the Mo family.Someone quietly whispered into Mo Tuo\u2019s ear, his face suddenly darkened to the extreme. Shockingly he walked down the stone tower of the Mo family and walked straight towards the Shi family.On the Beiming family\u2019s stone tower, Beiming Shang also shortly received the news. He moaned, and then also walked down his stone tower and came towards the Shi family.In the arena, the warriors were still intensely battling. Many bystanders were confused by Beiming Shang and Mo Tuo, who were walking towards the stone tower of the Shi family, wondering why these two were heading over to the Shi family\u2019s tower.In a short moment, the angry-looking Mo Tuo got to the Shi family\u2019s tower first.Right after he climbed up the tower, Mo Tuo immediately sprung up and screamed: \u201cShi Jian! Where is Mu Xun?\u201dShi Jian\u2019s expression darkened, and he sneered: \u201cHow would I know where Mu Xun is? Mo Tuo, you are asking the wrong person.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even try to pretend!\u201dMo Tuo\u2019s expression was of resentment, \u201cMu Xun is an outsider. Unless you and the Shi family secretly provided help, how could it be that our Mo family is unable to track him? Mu Xun is probably hiding in some manor of the Shi family. You better tell me exactly where he\u2019s hiding!\u201d\u201cMo Tuo, our family\u2019s business has nothing to do with you!\u201d Shi Jian snorted rudely.\u201cMy son Chaoge disappeared last night, and hasn\u2019t been seen since. It has to be Mu Xun! If it\u2019s someone else I might let it pass, but if Mu Xun dares to take Chaoge, I won\u2019t take it easy!\u201d Mo Tuo shouted in rage.After hearing that, everyone on the stone tower had a weird expression on their faces. They finally knew why Mo Tuo was so furious.Mo Chaoge was the strongest figure in the second generation of the Mo family. Not only did he have extraordinary capabilities, he was also very intelligent. Most of the machinations that the Mo family came up with were from this mastermind.The Shi family also had many people who suffered losses because of him.Mo Chaoge could be described as the most capable person in the second generation of the Mo family. Now that such an important figure had also gone missing, Mo Tuo couldn\u2019t sit still anymore. He finally came to start the fight.Mu Xun was really ruthless! Shi Yan\u2019s heart skipped a beat. He knew now that Mo Tuo was not going to let this go.\u201cI don\u2019t know where Mu Xun is, go spend some time and find him yourself. You\u2019re not welcome here.\u201d Shi Jian said indifferently. He was secretly happy inside, but he didn\u2019t stop insisting.\u201cHead of the Beiming family!\u201d Shi Tie exclaimed.Right at this moment, Beiming Shang slowly walked up the Shi family\u2019s stone tower. With furrowed brows he came to the side of Shi Jian and Mo Tuo. Beiming Shang glanced at the two, then casually said, \u201cThe Marital Competition is held by us five families. I hope everyone can keep calm, and not make trouble during the Martial Competition. Others will ridicule us.\u201d\u201cMy son Chaoge is gone!\u201d Mo Tuo yelled.Beiming Shang\u2019s expression froze for a second, then he said to Shi Jian, \u201cMaster Shi, that Mu Xun is, after all, an outsider. Although we should treat him well on his visit to the Merchant Union, there is a limit. His approach of taking away Mo Chaoge is truly too extreme. Master Shi, on this matter you should restrain yourself a little, don\u2019t go overboard.\u201dShi Jian\u2019s lips curled into a sneer, and his eyes coldly locked on Beiming Shang. He knew that the reason why Beiming Shang verbally spoke out for the Mo family was because the Mo family and Beiming Shang secretly had an agreement, with the common motive of exploring the \u2018Gate of Heaven\u2019.It looked like Beiming Shang stepped out to be the peacemaker, but he was actually supporting the Mo family.\u201cIt\u2019s the same as I told you before, I don\u2019t know where Mu Xun is at!\u201d Shi Jian was sure tough, he scowled and kept denying any knowledge of Mu Xun.Beiming Shang\u2019s brows slowly furrowed. He nodded and intervened no more. He said nonchalantly, \u201cAnyway, what I wish is for you to stay kind to each other during the Martial Competition so you won\u2019t make the Merchant Union look bad. You two, take care!\u201d\u201cShi Jian, by tonight, if you still don\u2019t send someone to tell me where Mu Xun is, in tomorrow\u2019s Martial Competition, don\u2019t blame us for taking offense! Hmph!\u201d Mo Tuo\u2019s shouted and viciously scanned across the room at all three generations of Shi family descendents, including Shi Tianke and Shi Tianyun, as if saying \u2018watch out for the lives of your sons and grandsons\u2019.\u201cMo Tuo, are you threatening me?\u201d Shi Jian\u2019s expression changed and he sneered, \u201cIf you screw around with things at tomorrow\u2019s Martial Competition, you too should not blame me for being ruthless!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care what you think! If I can\u2019t find Mu Xun, then just wait and watch what happens tomorrow.\u201d Mu Tuo took a deep breath in, stopped talking, and walked downstairs.\u201cMaster Shi, you need to look at the big picture here.\u201d Beiming Shang said apathetically, as he shook his head and followed Mo Tuo down the stairs.\u201cBoom!\u201dShi Jian punched the balcony of the stone tower, the rigid Green Iron receiving a huge fist-shaped imprint from his punch. Even the whole stone tower, which was several meters tall, was shaking violently from the impact.Everyone from the Shi family who was standing on the tower clearly felt his rage.\u201cThey\u2019re going too far!\u201d Shi Jian growled. No one knew if he\u2019s talking about Mo Tuo or Beiming Shang.Because of this little episode, Shi Jian\u2019s face was scary the whole day. At the end of that day of the Martial Competition, when he had to present the gifts to the winners, his expression was still ugly.That night.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the secret room, Han Feng bowed towards Shi Jian, and said, \u201cMaster, Mo Tuo and Beiming Shang are both giving us pressure now, what should we do?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry about them.\u201d Shi Jian continued scowling.\u201cMaster, we can let Mo Tuo slide, but Beiming Shang\u2026\u201d Han Feng said hesitantly.\u201cChi Xiao is still in the city, if Beiming Shang dares to mess with us, I\u2019d go ahead and shamelessly ask Chi Xiao to help me. I do not think Beiming Shang would launch an attack on our family for that shitty Mo family.\u201d Shi Jian snorted.\u201cUnderstood.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

These Green Stones were stacked higher as they moved away from the center of the arena, so it would be more convenient to watch the fighting in the arena.Before the five families even got here, the Green Stones around that one arena especially made for the battle of the five families were already filled with crowds.Just as the sun rose, the warriors the five families started to arrive from all around Tianyun City.Shi Yan followed Shi Jian. Before they even got to God Stone Square he could already see the massive crowds.These people were nearly all warriors, mostly in the Elementary, Nascent, or Human Realms, but there were some at the Disaster or Earth Realms as well.These Disaster and Earth Realm warriors might not have been interested in the Martial Competition, but the head-on fighting among the five families was enough to grab their attention.On the blocks of Green Stone around the arena, you could see many warriors whispering to each other.A lot of these warriors carried sturdy looking heavy swords and battle axes. They could have been mercenaries who came from the Dark Forest. None of them showed up in the previous days but today, they came bright and early.When the Shi family\u2019s people appeared in the God Stone Square, the warriors in the Square started murmuring, and made a path for the Shi family.The Shi family hadn\u2019t even entered the center of the arena yet, but again those warriors turned their heads to the entrance of the God Stone Square, and gasped in low voices.The Mo family, led by Mo Tuo, all came towards the arena with grim expressions.Shi Jian snorted. Scowling, he silently led the Shi family towards the arena.This time, the five families were not going to watch the fights from far away in their stone towers. Instead, they would stay at the nearest distance from the arena to be able to observe every single detail, as if visiting the frontline.On each side of the arena, the stone balconies were already set for them.The person waiting there saw Shi Jian, and immediately they came up smiling. \u201cMaster Shi, please take your seat here.\u201dShi Jian nodded and he followed him to the side of the arena, and sat on one of the stone chairs.Many different delicacies and fine wine were brought up on the stone table for Shi Jian and the Shi family members to enjoy.In a short moment, Mo Tuo was also lead here, his seat was arranged right across from the Shi family.After Mo Tuo sat down, he shot a freezing gaze towards the other side. No one knew what he was thinking about.When the sun\u2019s beams became a little brighter, the Zuo family and the Ling family also arrived. Right when Zuo Xu got here, his seat was arranged next to the Shi family.Zuo Xu sat down, then lightly nodded at Shi Jian, indicating that everything\u2019s going well with the Misty Pavilion, and they communicated in silence.The Ling family was friendly with the Mo family, so naturally they were arranged to be sat together.When Ling Shao Feng got here, he even smiled while walking over to the Mo family\u2019s side, comforting the gloomy-looking Mo Chan, and found an opportunity to talk to Mo Yanyu.Mo Chaoge, who went missing, was Mo Zhan\u2019s father. Knowing that his father was taken, Mo Zhan had been containing his anger for a while, just waiting for his bloody revenge in the Martial Competition.When the sun rose high above the sky, Beiming Shang finally arrived with the masters of the Beiming family.Beiming Shang\u2019s expression was cold and a freezing energy swirled around his body. Wherever he went, the warriors of the Merchant Union all respectfully made the path for him.Behind him was Beiming Ce who looked arrogant, followed by Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan.The person arranging seats was a slave of the Beiming family, and upon seeing his master, he naturally gave him the best seat. Bowing, he invited Beiming Shang and Beiming Ce to sit, then immediately called the servants to bring up the delicacies and fine wine.Both the quality and amount of the luxurious food was obviously better than the other four families. The superior position of the Beiming family in the Union was, as always, unobstructed.After the five families had taken their seats, Beiming Shang moaned, then said nonchalantly, \u201cThe rules are the same every year and I\u2019m not going to say much. The Martial Competition is only a way to communicate and learn from each other. I hope everyone can restrain themselves as much as possible. Hopefully no one gets killed.\u201dThe heads of the other four families all lightly nodded.Beiming Shang looked around, his eyes gazed deeply at both Mo Tuo and Shi Jian, and said, \u201cLike always, battle invitations are allowed, and you can also add more bets if you please, now who\u2019s going first?\u201d\u201cYu!\u201d Mo Tuo shouted.Mo Yanyu, who was standing in the group of Mo family members, walked down first. Her eyes cold and chilling. Looking towards the direction of the Shi family, she said, \u201cMo family Mo Yanyu, Nascent Realm, Second Sky. Who is willing to enlighten me?\u201d\u201cSnow Fall City, a silver sand mine, here is the land title deed.\u201d Mo Tuo scowled, and snorted.A dedicated warrior of the Mo family took the deed from his hand, and put it on a round table in the arena next to the Beiming family. The round table was made for placing bets.\u201cSunset City, the franchise of Dong Guan Street.\u201d Shi Jian also snorted, he took three yellow sheets from his brocade pocket, and passed it to the director next to him.When the three pages of yellow paper was also on the round table, Shi Jian said coldly, \u201cTian Luo, go.\u201dShi Tian Luo shook for a moment, then he also walked to the arena, and said with distinction, \u201cShi family Shi Tian Luo, Nascent Realm, Second Sky, please enlighten me.\u201d\u201cMo family\u2019s Mo Yanyu! Shi family\u2019s Shi Tian Luo! Both are at the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm. The two masters, have you made the decision to fight?\u201d The skinny director stood next to the round table and shouted out.When he saw both Shi Yan and Mo Tuo nodding, he then said, \u201cAlright, then the match starts!\u201d\u201cBzz bzz bzz!\u201dStreaks of green lightning suddenly flowed out of Mo Yanyu\u2019s ten fingers. Those lightning beams were like slithering snakes, slowing growing thicker in front of her.At this moment, Mo Yanyu seemed to be surrounded by lightning.Strands of green lightning that were as thin as a finger grew thicker and thicker, slowly becoming a five meter long whip.After the lightning whips were condensed into shape, they were as thick as arms. The electric glow was blinding people\u2019s eyes, and strong electrical currents shot laser beams off everywhere.\u201cSnap snap!\u201dMo Yanyu cracked her whip, and the lightning whip was like a dragon made of electricity. Under the deafening sounds of thunder, she fiercely whipped towards Shi Tian Luo.\u201cBzz bzz bzz!\u201dThe lightning lasered off into the air, making strange sounds, and streams of electricity flowed out. Many warriors\u2019 expressions froze, and instinctively they condensed their Profound Qi to defend themselves.Shi Tian Luo\u2019s skin was already in an ash grey color; the Shi family\u2019s Petrification Martial Spirit was ready for battle.Seeing the oncoming lightning whip, Shi Tian Luo face looked serious. All of a sudden he shouted loudly, and a fierce force as strong as a mountain suddenly burst out from his body.\u201c[Solid Rock Rune]!\u201dShi Tian Luo was as still as a mountain, his legs looked as if they were pitched deep within the earth. After petrification, his physical defense was extraordinary, such that he fearlessly reached his hand out to grab the lightning whip that came at him.\u201cBzz bzz!\u201dJust when Shi Tian Luo reached out his hand, the lightning whip wrapped around his left arm, and a shocking amount of electricity passed from the lightning whip and into Shi Tian Luo\u2019s body.\u201cArgh!\u201dShi Tian Luo roared, the Profound Qi in his petrified body scoured around inside his body, and quickly flowed into his left arm to restrain the electricity that was intruding into his body.Using the advantage of the Petrification Martial Spirit, although Shi Tian Luo\u2019s left hand was tingling and sore, he wasn\u2019t in that much of an unfavorable situation. After grabbing at the lightning whip, he ran towards Mo Yanyu, with great speed, and like a falling stone from the sky, he was filled with rapid momentum.The Petrification Martial Spirit of the Shi family was best used for close combat. Once a Shi family member came to a close distance, that was when the opponent\u2019s nightmare starts.Unexpectedly, seeing that Shi Tian Luo was fiercely approaching her, Mo Yanyu, who held the lightning whip in one hand did not dodge. Instead, she revealed a strange expression on her pretty little face.In a mere second Mo Yanyu\u2019s blushed face turned as pale as a sheet, like she was desperately sick, and all the blood rushed away from her face.And at this moment, the speed of her flowing Profound Qi within her body accelerated more than three times!It was as if all the potential in her body was suddenly released.\u201cThis is bad!\u201d Shi Yan thought silently, his heart dropped. He knew that Shi Tian Luo was most likely going to suffer this time.Mo Yanyu obviously only had a capability of a Nascent Realm, Second Sky warrior, but then her Profound Qi drastically changed inside her body, and now it was like she obtained some sort of power out of thin air that didn\u2019t belong to her!The Profound Qi in her body was much more vigorous than even that of a Nascent Realm, Third Sky warriorThis advantage meant she had no fear against Shi Tian Luo\u2019s Petrification Martial Spirit.Sure enough!Just when Shi Tian Luo stormed to Mo Yanyu\u2019s side, before he could strike any vigorous attacks, Mo Yan Yun unleashed waves of [Verdant Crescent Slash].Each [Verdant Crescent Slash] was as big as a full circle. It was over three times stronger than back when she shot it towards Shi Yan!Together seven waves of [Verdant Crescent Slash] burst from her other hand, so fast that Shi Tian Luo had no time to dodge at all.\u201cBoom boom boom boom boom boom boom!\u201dSeven waves of [Verdant Crescent Slash], all directly hit straight onto Shi Tian Luo\u2019s chest, and blasted Shi Tian Luo off into the air!The undeniable power of these seven waves of [Verdant Crescent Slash] was not something that the first stage of the Petrification Martial Spirit could handle.When Shi Tian Luo was still in mid-air, he was already bloody from head to toe.\u201cThump!\u201d Shi Tian Luo\u2019s body landed three meters in front of where Shi Jian was. Blood was gushing out his chest and his eyes were dilated, clearly he was badly hurt.\u201cGo help him!\u201dShi Jian\u2019s eyes looked like they were going to burst into flames, after he thundered in rage, his strong figure shook lightly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA few dedicated warriors from the Shi family who were preparing on the side rushed up and carried Shi Tian Luo away. They quickly gave him medicines, hastily trying to heal him.Shi Tie dug his fingers into the stone chair. He sat there still, not moving an inch, but his eyes were full of immense hatred, staring at the faraway Mo Tuo.Mo Tuo was also furious-looking, he exchanged stares with Shi Tie.\u201cMo Yanyu wins! The Mo family wins the bet, we may continue to the next match.\u201dAt this moment, the director\u2019s emotionless voice rang from the other side of the round table.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It is worth my long travel here.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe arena was filled with boisterous discussions. The onlookers were all surprised at Mo Yanyu\u2019s ability.With a cold expression on her face, Mo Yanyu stood in the center of the field proudly, staring at the Shi family members with her frosty eyes, like a snow lotus on a snowy mountain.Those observing warriors also gazed at her hot body with sparkling eyes. They were surprised by her brutality but still couldn\u2019t stop complimenting her.On the Shi family side, everybody had a rigid face.Shi Tie was trembling with anger, but could do nothing except stare at Mo Tuo in hatred.This was the Martial Competition.

That\u2019s too weird!\u201d Shi Yan remarked in a low voice.\u201cI know.\u201d Shi Jian took a deep breath and turned to Shi Tian Ke and Shi Tian Yun with hesitation.He had apparently noticed that as well.At the halfway point of the battle, Mo Yanyu\u2019s face suddenly turned pale, and it was at that moment, the Profound Qi in Mo Yanyu\u2019s body became much more dense and circulated much faster, which was abnormal.\u201cYu back! Mo Qi, up!\u201d Just then, Mo Tuo demanded, \u201cwe are not going to change the wager, and invite a battle with the Shi family again!\u201dAnother youth about 6 feet tall replaced Mo Yanyu at the center of the arena, and said proudly, \u201cMo Qi of the Mo family. Nascent Realm, Second Sky. Please enlighten me!\u201d\u201cBig brother!\u201d Shi Tie yelled, and looked at Shi Tian Ke who stood behind him with worried eyes, \u201cWhat should we do now?\u201d\u201cFight!\u201d Shi Jian grit his teeth, thought for a while, and announced, \u201cTian Yun, up!\u201dAll Shi family members were shocked at this and turned pale, as they looked at Shi Jian in confusion.Shi Tian Yun was the most talented among the third generation of Shi family, and was at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm. Thus everybody believed he would fight last.Now that Shi Jian had sent him up so early, who would fight in the following battles?Mo Zhan was of the third generation of the Mo family, but he was not on the stage yet. No matter if Shi Tian Yun won or lost this battle, he would lose the chance to fight against Mo Zhan.Who will be sent to fight against Mo Zhan later?If they couldn\u2019t find anyone to compete with Mo Zhan, everybody would think there were no promising descendents in the third generation of the Shi family, which was a bigger shame than losing the competition!\u201cBig brother!\u201d Shi Tie cried, \u201cMo Zhan hasn\u2019t been sent!\u201d\u201cIt must be Tian Yun! There is something strange going on so we have to send Tian Yun who is one Sky higher than him.\u201d Shi Jian stated with a frosty face, \u201cShut up! Tian Yun! Go!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Tian Yun replied firmly and directly stepped onto the arena, \u201cShi Tian Yun from the Shi family. Nascent Realm, Third Sky. Please enlighten me!\u201d\u201cShi Tian Yun! Isn\u2019t he the strongest in the third generation of the Shi family?\u201d\u201cExactly, why did he appear so early when Mo Zhan is still not on stage?\u201d\u201cThe Shi family is scared now. They have no choice but to send Shi Tian Yun up to fight. Now it\u2019s getting interesting. One is at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm and the other is at the Second Sky. One Sky different. I guess the Mo family won\u2019t accept this fight. They will definitely change their warrior.\u201d\u201cWell, the Mo family won\u2019t buy it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe onlookers were all discussing among each other in astonishment.Many from the Beiming and Ling families were looking on with doubt in their eyes, staring at the Shi family with weird expressions.Even some faces from the Zuo family were filled with surprise, not knowing what Shi Jian was thinking.Only Zuo Xu and Zuo Shi knew what was going on. They stealthily looked over to Shi Yan.\u201cBeiluo City! One mine! And the commercial street in the south of Beiluo City!\u201d Shi Jian took a deep breath and pulled out all the documents from his bag and handed them to the director.\u201cMo Qi from the Mo family, Second Sky of the Nascent Realm; Shi Tian Yun from the Shi Family, Third Sky of the Nascent Realm. Is it right?\u201d As the wagers put on the table, the director frowned at Shi Jian and Mo Tuo.Mo Tuo was a little confused, as he glanced over at Shi Tian Yun, not knowing why it was him who was sent.After hesitating, Mo Tuo had a small talk with an old man, a mussy-haired one who was standing beside him and nodded softly.Seeing him nodding, Mo Tuo seemed to be relaxed, as he nodded at the coach, \u201cNo problem, our warriors of the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm can easily beat those of Third Sky of the Nascent Realm from the Shi family. We are in!\u201d\u201cNow, the battle begins!\u201dShi Tian Yun immediately petrified his body, while Mo Qi yelled once and lightning intertwined his arms.\u201cMo Qi, prove yourself as soon as possible. Don\u2019t let others look down upon you.\u201d Mo Tuo reminded him indifferently.Hearing that, Mo Qi quickly understood what to do.In an instant, like Mo Yanyu, Mo Qi\u2019s face turned as pale as a zombie, which was extremely horrifying.It was exactly the same.In Mo Qi\u2019s body, the flow of his Profound Qi accelerated many times! A certain energy that didn\u2019t belong to him seemed to be triggered and invaded his entire body. His aura suddenly overwhelmed Shi Tian Yun who was one Sky higher than him!\u201cThere it goes!\u201d Shi Tie yelled in anger, \u201cThey must have played a certain trick! This is not the type of power that could belong to a warrior of the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm!\u201dShi Jian looked depressed as he nodded, \u201cDid you notice that? Mo Tuo had a talk with the old man behind him before he permitted the battle. Mo Yanyu and Mo Qi\u2019s weird change must have something to do with that old man!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t let him go peacefully!\u201d Shi Tie greeted his teeth.\u2014\u201cBang!\u201dShi Tian Yun kicked off the ground with one foot and the solid metal stone made a thunderous sound as if it had been cracked.Shi Tian Yun shot towards Mo Qi like a sharp sword at his fastest speed, intending to cripple Mo Qi as soon as possible.Mo Qi smiled coldly without fear, as he directly met Shi Tian Yun, emitted flashes of lightning which flew towards him rapidly!As he released the lightning flashes, green balls of light burst out from the center of Mo Qi\u2019s palm. They began to strike Shi Tian Yun heavily.\u201cBang bang bang! Bang bang bang!\u201dOne after another, green light balls struck Shi Tian Yun and slowed his attacks.Just then, the Profound Qi in Mo Qi\u2019s body surged again! He appeared in front of Shi Tian Yun suddenly from behind the green balls.The lightning flashes magically formed an electric net in the sky, and wrapped up Shi Tian Yun in an instant.\u201cHow is that possible?! The energy in that kid equals that of a Human Realm warrior!\u201d Shi Tie screamed in fear.Shi Tian Yun was tightly entangled by the electric net. He struggled to get escape it but failed.At this time, Mo Qi\u2019s green light balls kept striking Shi Tian Yun one by one and drove him back.Mo Qi dashed near Shi Tian Yun and kept striking him with his arms and legs.Shi Tian Yun was bleeding severely from the corner of his mouth, but he couldn\u2019t fight back because of the electric net that bound him tightly.What a thorough defeat!Everybody was stricken dumb in amazement as they stared at Mo Qi, who was merely at the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm, while he was striking Shi Tian Yun who could not fight back.\u201cWoa! What the hell is that?\u201d\u201cWho knows? Why is that kid so powerful? It\u2019s weird, too weird!\u201d\u201cIs he really at the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm? Or are the Nascent Realm warriors of the big families one level higher than us?\u201d\u201cConfusing! Too confusing!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAll the warriors nearby were dumbstruck and couldn\u2019t figure out what happened.\u201cBang bang bang! Bang bang bang!\u201dAfter receiving the endless strikes, Shi Tian Yun was bleeding severely and his eyes gradually began to dim.Shi Jian stood up at once and demanded, \u201cWe lose!\u201dThe director from the Beiming Family, who was standing next to the round table, immediately looked over to Beiming Shang after Shi Jian yelled.Beiming Shang seemed to not have noticed the scene on the battle arena, as he was still drinking his tea quietly.Seeing his attitude, the director understood what he meant. He lowered his head to check the documents, ignoring Shi Jian\u2019s announcement.\u201cBang bang bang!\u201dMo Qi continued to kick Shi Tian Yun, as the latter had fallen onto the ground long ago.\u201cWe admit defeat!\u201d Shi Jian stared at Beiming Shang and roared.Beiming Shang finally seemed to notice it, as he raised his head and then peered at the director casually.\u201cBattle stops! The Mo family wins!\u201d the director called out listlessly.Mo Qi finally stopped his attacks and took a few steps back. Smirking, he laughed, \u201cHaha! Shi family descendents are all losers! He is too weak for a Nascent Realm, Third Sky warrior! It was a total waste of my time. Humph!\u201dThen he swaggered back to his family and received a bunch of compliments.Han Feng rushed onto the arena silently like a ghost and carried Shi Tian Yun back, who was drowning in his own blood, and asked those family ministers to check on him.Those ministers were in a muddle, as they firstly put a handful of pills into Shi Tian Yun\u2019s mouth, with serious faces.Not bothering to stare at Mo Tuo, Shi Tie quickly pressed his hands on Shi Tian Yun\u2019s chest and transmitted his Profound Qi into Tian Yun to heal him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe battle field turned silent at once.Those onlookers noticed this strange occurrence. They stopped gossiping, but looked at the two families in confusion.\u201cKeep the wager, and Zhan, you go up!\u201d Mo Tuo announced at a low voice again, with a cold smile climbing up his mouth.\u201cMo Zhan from the Mo family. Nascent Realm, Third Sky. Please enlighten me!\u201dMo Zhan\u2019s robust body stood in the center of the arena, and he sneered, \u201cI\u2019m quite curious, does your Shi family still have people to fight me? Do you dare?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 69 \u2013 Believe in Me!The whole God Stone Square was silent. Mo Zhan\u2019s clamoring seemed to echo in the arena.Shi Jian face was in a grimace, and he was trembling in rage. He almost wanted to go to the middle of the arena and slap Mo Zhan to death.The Beiming, Ling, Mo, and Zuo families all looked at Shi Jian. Many warriors around the arena were looking at Shi Jian in sympathy.At this point, everyone could see the vicious heart of the Mo family, and they also knew that they had definitely used some unusual means.However, that\u2019s what the Martial Competition was like. Each side would use their own methods, and as long as they\u2019re not strongly against the rules of the arena, no matter how tragically the loser turned out to be, no one would say a thing.Even if the Shi family were highly displeased, at that moment, there was nothing they could argue about. And the others of course, would not step into such murky waters.At that moment, Han Feng suddenly came up from behind the people of the Shi family and passed a slip of paper to Shi Jian. He said, \u201cMaster, someone told me to give this to you.\u201dShi Jian was barely able to control his anger. As he took a glance at the note, his expression suddenly froze.\u201cThe children from the Mo family have taken the Blood Vigor Pill, made by the Poison Dragon Valley of the God Blessed Empire. The Blood Vigor Pill allows one to increase their strength by twofold for a short period of time at the cost of being unable to use their martial powers for a whole year. It is best for you not to continue the following matches, or else you will still lose miserably. The old man standing next to Mo Zhan is the alchemist Xie Shou from the Poisonous Dragon Valley! Sincerely, Mu Xun.\u201dShi Jian looked at the words on the paper with a grim face. He finally knew what the Mo family had done.Just to deal with the Shi family, Mo Tuo had sacrificed a year of his grandchildren\u2019s cultivation. In turn, this caused Shi Tian Luo and Shi Tian Yun of the Shi family to be bedridden for at least three to five years. This method was ruthless to the extreme!Shi Jian\u2019s expression was gloomy. Looking at Shi Yan, he suddenly could not decide how to proceed.If Mu Xun didn\u2019t pass on this information, Shi Jian might have actually let Shi Yan enter the arena.But since now the truth was known, Shi Jian knew that Mo Zhan must have also taken that Blood Vigor Pill, and that now his abilities were enhanced for the upcoming battle. Knowing this, Shi Jian faltered.Mo Zhan was already at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm. But after taking the Blood Vulgar Pill, he would have the ability of a Human Realm warrior. Human Realm warriors could easily break the second stage of Shi Yan\u2019s Petrification Martial Spirit.Shi Yan had only started cultivating recently, so Shi Jian naturally thought that Shi Yan lacked real battle experience.In this situation, Shi Yan could easily be crushed by his opponent. But Shi Yan had twin Martial Spirits. In a long run, he would definitely become as good as Beiming Ce. He was the true future hope of the Shi family.If this battle led to Shi Yan losing miserably and suffering heavy injuries, not only would it slow down his path to success, the strike could probably devastate him forever.The more he weighed his options, the more hesitant Shi Jian felt. He almost had the thought to protect Shi Yan even if he were to be disgraced.Then, at this moment.Zuo Shi came slowly from the Zuo family\u2019s side, carrying a giant backpack.Zuo Shi\u2019s captivating figure caused unrest outside the arena. Many looked at Zuo Shi lasciviously, their eyes gazing towards her beautiful long legs.Soon, Zuo Shi arrived at the Shi family\u2019s place. She stood next to Shi Jian and put the backpack on the Shi family\u2019s table, saying quietly, \u201cGrandpa Shi, my grandpa told me to bring the Dragon Turtle Armor to you in the hope that you would win.\u201dThen, she turned her head and looked at Shi Yan, and spoke quietly, \u201cGo for it.\u201dAfter that, Zuo Shi left the Shi family area and returned to the Zuo family.Even when she arrived back at the Zuo family, her beautiful eyes were still locked onto Shi Yan from across the arena.Everyone in the Shi family felt devastated.Not only those who didn\u2019t know about Shi Yan\u2019s situation, even those who were actually aware of Shi Yan\u2019s cultivation level were also pitying him.A warrior who just recently broke through to the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm, versus one who heavily trained for twenty years, and slowly came to this realm step by step. It\u2019s clear who was stronger.Besides, the Mo family obviously played dirty, so now the actual gap between the two was like a deep valley.\u201cDragon Turtle Armor!\u201dWhen Shi Jian saw the armour he was completely shocked. Even though his confidence was restored, he still hesitated a bit. Passing the paper slip to Shi Yan, he murmured, \u201cSigh\u2026 grandpa doesn\u2019t know what to do either, you decide for yourself. If you think it\u2019s too hard, then\u2026 just give up.\u201dWhen he said the words \u201cgive up\u201d, Shi Jian suddenly felt exhausted, as if he aged some years.Shi Yan still looked unconcerned with the recent surprising developments. He glanced at the paper slip, but didn\u2019t show any reaction. He was still calm as ever. He had already realised that the Mo family must have used some underhanded means.Before Shi Jian had even finished speaking, Shi Yan leapt off and appeared in the middle of the arena. He spoke lightly, \u201cShi Yan from the Shi family. Nascent Realm, Third Sky. Please enlighten me!\u201dA great disturbance stirred in the crowd!The silent arena suddenly became louder than the street markets. Many were in utter shock, puzzled, as they looked at Shi Yan.\u201cWho\u2019s this kid? I\u2019ve never heard of this guy in the Shi family.\u201d\u201cRight, he never showed up in any of the previous Martial Competitions. When did the Shi family get such a warrior?\u201d\u201cShi Yan\u2026 I know. Isn\u2019t he that young master of the Shi family who loves to study ancient texts? This guy never practiced martial arts. I only know him because he always caused trouble.\u201d\u201cNo way! He has never cultivated in martial arts, but still is at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm?\u201d\u201cWho knows? But even if he is at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm, what can he do? You saw what happened when Mo Qi, who\u2019s only at the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm, went against Shi Tian Yun, who was at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm. About that Shi Yan guy, maybe it\u2019s only because Shi Jian doesn\u2019t want to be embarrassed so he sent him out to die.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 sigh\u2026 poor guy, being sacrificed like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAround the arena, the sounds of gossip rose everywhere. Not a single warrior felt optimistic about Shi Yan. After knowing his true identity, they all thought Shi Jian had only let him go up out of frustration. The outcome\u2026 was already decided.On the Beiming family\u2019s side, Beiming Shang also furrowed his brows slightly. He turned his head to a dedicated warrior on the side, \u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with Shi Yan? Why was there no news about him? When did the Shi family get another Nascent Realm, Third Sky kid? Did he appear out of thin air?\u201d\u201cMaster, I didn\u2019t know either. Since a young age Shi Yan didn\u2019t have the Shi family\u2019s Martial Spirit, so we didn\u2019t spend much effort observing him. Who knew that he suddenly\u2026\u201d\u201cA little strange.\u201d Beiming Shang nodded, he frowned and asked no more.Beiming Ce was dazed for a second, as a flash of surprise gleamed in his eyes. He stared at Shi Yan for a while, then suddenly realized, \u201cHey? Isn\u2019t that the kid who was drinking with Han Zhong in the Spring Pavilion, a few days back?\u201dMu Yu Die and Di Yalan also remembered, and lightly nodded at the same time. From far away, Di Yalan stared at Shi Yan, who was talked about by many people in the arena. Her expression was a little strange, and with a low voice she said, \u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s definitely gonna die.\u201d Beiming Ce shook his head, unconcerned, \u201cNo matter how amazing his luck was before, this time, against Mo Zhan, he\u2019ll be crippled, if not killed.\u201dMo Tuo also dazed out for a second, then he sneered, \u201cI don\u2019t care where this little bastard came from, but we\u2019ll never see him again.\u201d\u201cShi Yan, take that thing!\u201d Shi Jian shouted while grimacing. He pointed at the Dragon Turtle Armor brought by Zuo Shi, and hinted at him.\u201cDon\u2019t need it.\u201d Shi Yan glimpsed over at Shi Jian, and shook his head. Then he smiled at Mo Zhan, \u201cAt the Spring Pavilion, I told you we\u2019d meet again. Now do you know who I am?\u201d\u201cI know.\u201d Mo Zhan laughed arrogantly, \u201cYou\u2019re just someone who came here to die! Haha, the Shi family really has nobody now. Sending out a guy who researches ancient texts! Hahaha, I\u2019m gonna laugh to the death!\u201dShi Yan didn\u2019t show any anger, he looked indifferent, and stood in the arena waiting.\u201cAhem, head of the Shi family, you can put out your bet now.\u201d The director standing at the round table shouted out.\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201dAt the Shi family tower, many of the dedicated warriors shouted, clearly indicating their displeasure.All of them had heard about Shi Yan. Even if he had somehow reached the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm, everyone believed that it was for nought, and that Shi Yan would lose miserably.If Shi family lost the fight again, not only would they would be crushed in the competition, they would also lose their high-value bets, the repercussion of which, would last forever.\u201cBrother! You must not!\u201d Shi Tie advised Shi Tian strongly, still injecting his Profound Qi into Tian Yun. \u201cBrother! It\u2019s not worth that little bit of pride! Tian Luo and Tian Yun have already lost, you can\u2019t bring Shi Yan in too! Just let it go, Brother!\u201dShi Yan could clearly hear all the chatter behind him. Groaning, he looked back at Shi Jian and said calmly, \u201cGrandpa, believe in me!\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay!\u201dShi Jian, who was hesitating over his choices, looked at Shi Yan\u2019s confident expression. And for some reason, he actually did choose to believe in him. He suddenly roared, \u201cPhoenix City! Our family bets the authority to the whole city! If the Mo family wins, our family will cede the authority for Phoenix City immediately!\u201dThis led to another great disturbance in the crowd, everyone started gossiping and chatting again.Phoenix City was a big city in the Merchant Union, and the Shi family had been holding the authority to the city for decades. Now Phoenix City had been branded with the Shi family\u2019s name.It could be said that Phoenix City was where the Shi family\u2019s influence was deepest. Now Shi Jian was putting up the authority for Phoenix City as a bet, was he going insane?\u201cBig brother!\u201d\u201cMaster!\u201dEveryone in the Shi family were on their feet as they looked at Shi Jain in disbelief. All of them started requesting Shi Jian to take back the bet vehemently.\u201cStop trying to persuade me! My mind is set!\u201d Shi Jian\u2019s stubbornness was back, and with a straight face, he sneered, \u201cIt\u2019s either make or break! I will take the risk this time!\u201dEveryone in the Beiming family and the Ling family were also stunned, clearly they didn\u2019t understand either.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZuo Xu dazed for a moment, then sighed and said quietly, \u201cNow there\u2019s no turning back for Brother Shi.\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d Mo Tuo suddenly stood up, and shouted loudly, \u201cYou can\u2019t take this back now!\u201d\u201cTake it!\u201d Shi Jian took the deeds from his personal pocket, and passed it to the director who came towards him. Then he shouted coldly, \u201cMo Tuo, your little bet is not enough!\u201d\u201cI will add three more mines!\u201d Mo Tuo scowled, then sneered, \u201cIt\u2019s a sure win match, doesn\u2019t matter how much more I add, after all it will still belong to the Mo family in the end!\u201dSoon, the director took the bet from the Mo family up to the round table, then suddenly roared, \u201cThe match starts!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His Lightning Martial Spirit was apparently way more powerful than Mo Yanyu\u2019s and Mo Qi\u2019s.As his face gradually turned pale, those electric snakes kept twisting around his body, looking hideous and seemingly wanting to eat people.\u201cThe Petrification Martial Spirit of the Shi Family is said to be the king of close range battle in the Merchant Union. Hehe, I will give you a chance. Come near me and fight!\u201d Mo Zhan stood still and burst into laughter with arrogance and pride filling his face, not caring about Shi Yan a bit.\u201cThat guy is way too arrogant!\u201d\u201cWell, he is in the position to be arrogant. The Lightning Martial Spirit of his is way stronger than that Mo Qi\u2019s. The result is quite clear now!\u201d\u201cExactly, the Shi Family will have a nasty failure for sure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAround the battle arena, the warriors standing on the high green stone building were all shaking their heads as no one anticipated that Shi Yan could beat Mo Zhan.Even on the Shi family\u2019s side everybody was in bad mood, sighing with disappointment.\u201cWell.\u201dWith his usual indifference, Shi Yan strode towards Mo Zhan at a leisurely pace, as though he thought nothing of him.While walking, his body petrified gradually and his skin grew gray.Before he came into the battle arena, Shi Yan had wiped a certain powder all over his body.That powder did nothing but changed the color of his Martial Spirit so that it looked gray even though his Petrification Martial Spirit had already reached the second stage.Shi Jian did this as he wanted to avoid anyone thinking they were cheating. After all, it was a known fact that a Nascent Realm warrior couldn\u2019t reach the second stage of the Petrification Martial Spirit.\u201cKid, you were really something in the Spring Pavilion! I hope you can be as sharp as you were then!\u201d Mo Zhan smiled coldly with his pale face, as he stood still and waited for Shi Yan to approach.\u201cSharp or not, you will know soon enough.\u201d Shi Yan shook his head with a smile. As he replied, he was within three metres of Mo Zhan.\u201cHumph!\u201dSuddenly, Mo Zhan yelled in a low voice and the electric snakes coiling around his body came to life.Those electric snakes flew out and dashed towards Shi Yan in a second.\u201cDamn!\u201d Shi Tie cried in fear, \u201cThere they go!\u201d\u201cDodge!\u201d Shi Yang couldn\u2019t help but cry out.\u201cHiss hiss hiss!\u201dThe electric snakes were as thick as thumbs and separated at once as if they were alive, entangling Shi Yan from all directions, not leaving any gaps.Ignoring the cries of the Shi family, the electric snakes wrapped Shi Yan up tightly in an instant.\u201cBad!\u201d Shi Tie\u2019s eyes were full of fear, as he sighed with pain, \u201cHow stupid is this kid! He didn\u2019t even dodge, even when he knows how Tian Yun lost! Now he is repeating the same tragedy! It\u2019s done!\u201d\u201cNot surprising!\u201d\u201cYeah, this guy studies ancient language. Stupid!\u201d\u201cThere is no suspense. I guess he won\u2019t even have the slightest chance to fight back.\u201dAround the battle arena, those warriors were all feeling sorry for Shi Yan, as they shook their heads in sorrow, seeming to know the result.It turned out just as everybody assumed!Mo Zhan seized this opportunity and rushed up to Shi Yan. With a [Verdant Crescent Slash] in his left hand and a [Green Light Ball] in his right hand, he struck his opponent who was entangled tightly by electric snakes.\u201cBoom boom boom boom! Boom boom boom boom!\u201dThe [Verdant Crescent Slashes] and [Green Light Balls] were shooting like a hail, and covered Shi Yan in an instant.Under Mo Zhan\u2019s intense attacks, nobody could clearly see Shi Yan who was buried under the lightning, and they simply guessed he would lose for sure.One after another electric slashes flashed with green light, and the audience saw the arena clearly again.Shi Yan was still standing there and hadn\u2019t moved. He was not hurt in the slightest and smoke was coming from his coat.\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be true?\u201dAs the green light dissipated and the warriors saw Shi Yan clearly, they couldn\u2019t help but rub their eyes, surprised by Shi Yan who was still standing in the arena like a mountain.Beiming Shang also raised his head from his teacup and looked at Shi Yan in astonishment. He frowned and mumbled, \u201cWeird.\u201dMo Tuo\u2019s expression changed, but he still kept calm and just grunted once.Shi Jian\u2019s body quivered once and a bright light crossed his eyes. After taking a deep breath, he pressed one of his hands to the stone stool and became excited.\u201cBig brother!\u201d\u201cFamily Head!\u201dShi Tie and the Shi family warriors looked to Shi Jian at the same time, with joy and confusion on their faces.\u201cKeep on!\u201d Shi Jian yelled, as his mouth trembled a bit.Though still feeling confused after what they heard, Shi Tie and those ministers of the Shi family got a little expectation of Shi Yan.In the arena.Shi Yan was still entangled by the electric snakes, but apart from a little numbness after using his Petrification ability, he felt nothing else, as he still maintained an indifferent expression on his face.Wisps of thin smoke gushed out from his arms which soon covered the electricity from those snakes, thus no one could see the change in his arms.While he was being struck heavily, his negative energy had mingled with his Profound Qi and gushed out from his arms, turning into five small swirls which floated around him.These swirls created by the [Gravitational Field] combined these two types of energy, which slowly floated behind Mo Zhan.The swirls were invisible to anyone. Apart from Shi Yan, in this huge battle field, only a Human Realm warrior like Beiming Shang could sense it.\u201cMo Zhan, you are so weak!\u201d Under the gaze of the audience, Shi Yan broadened his mouth, as he laughed and smirked, \u201cYou can\u2019t even hurt me when I stood there and didn\u2019t fight back. How did the Mo family become one of the five big families in the Merchant Union with skills like yours?\u201d\u201cKid, you are seeking death!\u201d Mo Zhan\u2019s face changed suddenly and became even paler. He dashed over with a stern face toward Shi Yan, and just as Mo Qi kicked Shi Tian Yun, he began to kick Shi Yan like crazy.\u201cBoom boom boom! Bang bang bang!\u201dMo Zhan\u2019s hard attacks dropped upon Shi Yan, while the arena was filled with green light and strong Profound Qi began to spill everywhere.\u201cStill weak. Mo Zhan, are you a girl?\u201dUnder Mo Zhan\u2019s attacks, Shi Yan was unmovable like a mountain and couldn\u2019t stop shaking his head, ridiculing him with crueler and crueler words, \u201cIf you don\u2019t have a thing down there I can help you satisfy your wife on your wedding day, in case that you make a fool of yourself!\u201dThat was too wicked!Ling Yue Yue from the Ling family suddenly stood up and cursed in a flirtatious tone, \u201cShi Yan, you will die a miserable death!\u201d\u201cI want you to die!\u201dMo Zhan howled and triggered all his potential at once. He jumped towards Shi Yan and started sending out another rain of punches.\u201cBang!\u201dHowever, Shi Yan simply stretched one leg and kicked Mo Zhan in the chest. That kick, by his sole free leg, sent Mo Zhan five meters away.\u201cBoring.\u201d Shi Yan grunted in disappointment as he got rid of the electric snakes.Those electric snakes, which were crawling all over him, broke away inch by inch!The shattered electric sparks dispersed all around the arena\u201cBe careful!\u201d\u201cDamn it!\u201dThe warriors nearest to the arena shouted and hurried to operate their Profound Qi to defend against those electric sparks.\u201cGood boy!\u201d Zuo Xu patted the arm of his chair and praised, \u201cI like this guy!\u201dZuo Shi\u2019s bright eyes were shining with an odd light as she nodded at Shi Yan and smiled, \u201cWell, this guy is really mean.\u201d\u201cBig brother!\u201d\u201cFamily Head! Wh\u2026 what is going on here?\u201dOn the other side, Shi Tie and the Shi family ministers all looked to Shi Jian in surprise.\u201cIt\u2019s fine. It\u2019s just that the Mo family is too weak.\u201d Shi Jian responded briefly, following Shi Yan\u2019s directions. Suddenly the feeling in the air had become fresh.Mo Tuo stood up with a green face. He stared at Mo Zhan and his breathing became heavier and heavier.\u201cThose eyes, I have seen them somewhere\u2026\u201d On the side of the Beiming Family, Di Yalan showed a little suspicion on her face, and she murmured after a long deliberation.But at that time, no one paid attention to her murmurs. Instead, everybody was setting their eyes upon Shi Yan and following his movements.After getting rid of the electric snakes, Shi Yan started strolling towards Mo Zhan. Mo Zhan lifted himself up from the ground and rushed towards Shi Yan in a rage.At that moment!Mo Zhan\u2019s body began to twist strangely as willow flowers fluttered in the air. Something invisible had entangled him tightly. The harder he struggled, the stranger the way he swayed. At last, he floated up into the air\u2026There seemed to be an invisible wicked hand behind him that had grabbed his neck and lifted him up.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know! What\u2019s wrong with Mo Zhan? Is he out of his mind?\u201d\u201cWho knows what\u2019s going on? Why is Mo Zhan floating in the air? Is he at the Sky Realm?\u201d\u201cDo you even think it\u2019s possible?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe arena burst into clamor at once.Shi Yan came near Mo Zhan with an indifferent face and slowly stretched out his hand. His fingers stabbed into Mo Zhan\u2019s knee like five sharp spears.\u201cCrack! Crack!\u201dThe clear sounds of bones breaking came from Mo Zhan\u2019s knees.\u201cCrack! Crack!\u201dAnother two similar noises came from his shoulders.\u201cPaa!\u201dMo Zhan was totally freaking out in front of Shi Yan. He couldn\u2019t help but fall on his knees.Not a single bone in his joints were connected. Pathetically kneeling in front of Shi Yan in front of such a huge crowd made him roar insanely, \u201cShi Yan, I am gonna kill you! KILL YOU!\u201d\u201cOh? Really?\u201d Shi Yan looked cool, as he grabbed Mo Zhan\u2019s neck and lifted him high up in the air again.Mo Zhan tried his electric skill on Shi Yan but it had no effect.In front of hundreds of eyes, Mo Zhan was lifted up by Shi Yan single handedly; it was a deliberate insult!Shi Yan intended to show Mo Zhan\u2019s expression to everybody, for he circled the arena, so that every warrior present could see the grief and fear on Mo Zhan\u2019s face.After one circle, Shi Yan turned his eyes towards Shi Jian and sent the message: to kill or not?The arena quietened down suddenly and all the warriors gazed at Shi Yan.Tens of meters away, Shi Jian got Shi Yan\u2019s message and was quite delighted.Under Shi Yan\u2019s gaze, Shi Jian nodded softly with a rigid face.\u201cWe give up!\u201d Mo Tuo was shocked and he cried miserably after he saw Shi Jian\u2019s cold eyes, \u201cWe lose! We lose!\u201d\u201cStop!\u201d The referee at the roundtable announced immediately.\u201cCrack!\u201dAnother clear sound came from Mo Zhan\u2019s neck, and his head flapped down in an odd way.All the warriors were horrified. They looked at Shi Yan, who had just shattered Mo Zhan\u2019s neck, in quiet astonishment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was extremely silent in the arena.Under everybody\u2019s gaze, Shi Yan tossed away Mo Zhan\u2019s body indifferently.\u201cPaa!\u201dMo Zhan\u2019s dead body landed three meters in front of Mo Tuo, with his head strangely twisted.Sneering at the Mo family, Shi Yan returned to the Shi family tower and without any care and took his seat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You old man!\u201dMo Tuo\u2019s eyes were filled with endless hatred. With a raging roar he suddenly stormed towards the arena, and thundered, \u201cYou killed my Zhan and destroyed my family\u2019s future hope. I WILL bury you by his side!\u201dMo Zhan\u2019s death truly provoked him. Mo Tuo didn\u2019t even care about the rest of the Martial Competition. He straightaway rushed towards the Shi familyAs Mo Tuo made his move, all the distraught members of the Mo family also stood up. They all rushed into the arena and sprinted towards the Shi family.\u201cMo Tuo! My two grandsons are still lying on the ground!\u201d Shi Jian was in violent rage as he also rushed forward. Staring coldly at the approaching Mo Tuo, he sneered, \u201cYou were totally calm when you were winning, but lost your temper as soon as you were defeated? Hmph! If you can\u2019t afford to lose, then don\u2019t participate in the Martial Competition at all!\u201d\u201cCalm down all of you!\u201dBeiming Shang\u2019s expression was stern as he stood up. Suddenly the temperature around the arena dropped by considerable degree as frigid air started emitting from his body.Even though the sun was at its height, all the warriors around the arena felt chilly.\u201cStand down!\u201d Mo Tuo suddenly turned back his head and shouted to the grieved members of the Mo family.To this the dedicated warriors and masters of the Mo family were unwilling, but under Mo Tuo\u2019s cold gaze, everybody retreated back to their places.\u201cShi Jian, would you dare to fight solo with me!\u201d When the people of the Mo family backed away, Mo Tuo suddenly roared from the middle of the arena.\u201cWoah! No way?\u201d\u201cNow this is gonna be quite a show! A battle between two family heads!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t come thousands of miles in vain, this time the arena is truly splendid!\u201dThe crowd was totally excited as they looked at Shi Jian in expectation.\u201cWhy not?\u201d Shi Jian sneered, and also stepped into the center of the arena. He greeted Beiming Shang and said, \u201cBeiming Family Head, Mo Tuo and I will have a fair fight, I\u2019m sure this is not against the rules?\u201dFrigid air was seeping from Beiming Shang\u2019s body. He groaned and furrowed his brow for a moment, and then slowly sat down, shaking his head, he sighed, \u201cWhy bother you two? But if you really wish to fight, I wouldn\u2019t stop you. I only hope that you restrain yourselves and don\u2019t hurt others.\u201dShi Yan was totally unfazed by the recent developments and was sitting nonchalantly at the Shi family\u2019s side. Seeing that Shi Jian had also stepped into the arena, his eyes furrowed deeply, knowing that this time it wouldn\u2019t end easily.However, just when the two were about to fight to the death, the entire Tianyun City seemed to shake for a second. In the far distance, the tall stone tower of the Misty Pavilion, which was dozens of meters high, instantly toppled down.Even from thousands of meters away, one could see the silhouette of a female above the tower, wearing a black crape and a bamboo hat.This was clearly a very stunning woman.She was just like a goddess, with her hands above her head, as if holding something.That piece of the sky looked like it was time-warped, with masses of strange air flooded the clouds.From the clouds, some mysterious power in the river of time turned into pillars of light, and all of a sudden stormed down from the heavens, shooting directly into the woman\u2019s upheld hands.An earth-shakingly strong force suddenly spread out from the woman\u2019s body.Thousands of meters away, the warriors in the arena could all feel the terrifying force coming from her.Streaks of exotic beams abruptly shot out from her body. Due to the great density of the beam, it was as if multiple rainbows were wrapping around her.\u201cSky Realm master!\u201d\u201cWho is this woman? So powerful!\u201d\u201cWhat is happening? Why is there another Sky Realm master in the city?\u201dAll the people in the arena were totally focused in her direction, completely forgetting Mo Tuo and Shi Jian\u2019s fight.In the blazing hot sunlight, the woman with the perfect body raised her hands in mid-air.Suddenly an enormous radiant hand emerged from the sky, and violently smashed down like a mountain.Under that gigantic hand, a black dot was forming, which was slowly increasing in size\u2026Gradually, that black dot formed into the silhouette of a person.The god-like giant hand, spreading over hundreds of meters, smashed down on the ground with immense force. The silhouette of the person formed from that black dot, suddenly warped and disappeared into streams of dark light.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe enormous hand completely destroyed the three, twenty-meter high Misty Pavilion towers. The rigid Green Iron towers became metal scraps, flying everywhere.The woman in the black crape and bamboo hat stood in the air above the ruin of the Misty Pavilion for a moment, and then flew towards the arena.In merely a few seconds, she arrived above the arena, condescendingly looking at the crowd below. With her angel-like voice, she said, \u201cHalf of the map is on my hands. Mo Family Head, if you really want it, just come and take in upfront; no need to play tricks in the dark.\u201d\u201cOur Mo family didn\u2019t do it!\u201d Mo Tuo looked up at her and roared, but there was a flash of surprise in his eyes.Mo Tuo was only at the Third Sky of the Nirvana Realm, but this woman could walk in mid-air, which was a trait of Sky Realm warriors!\u201dHow could Mo Tuo not be afraid?\u201cMiss!\u201dTwo giant men pushed their way among the crowd, and immediately appeared outside the arena.In mid-air, the floating goddess-like woman pointed at Mo Tuo and commanded, \u201cTeach him a little lesson.\u201d\u201cYes, Miss!\u201dThe two giant men roared as their muscles suddenly bulged. They were already two meters tall, but instantly grew by some centimeters while exerting power, with dark thick hair suddenly growing on their bodies.In a flash, the two men turned into what looked like rabid beasts, their eyes filled with a bloodthirsty and murderous look.The two giant men suddenly dashed out, the strong Green Iron rubble exploding into pieces everywhere they went!\u201cWho are you? This is the Merchant Union\u2019s arena; we will not allow you to cause trouble here!\u201d Beiming Shang suddenly roared into the heavens, frigid air seeping from him.Howling, Beiming Shang also flew into the air.Balls of strange blue flames flew from his body. Those flames shortly condensed into blue fire clouds. These icy clouds, along with the power to freeze the heaven and earth, shot towards the woman.\u201cBeiming Shang, is it?\u201d The woman\u2019s voice was still sweet as she said indifferently, \u201cThe Misty Pavilion\u2019s business has nothing to do with you! Your Beiming family can act like an overlord in the Merchant Union, but in the Endless Sea, you would not even be a third-rate family! You better know your place!\u201d\u201cArrogant!\u201d Beiming Shang raised himself into mid-air and stood across from the woman, his face as cold as glacier. He sneered, \u201cI would like to see exactly how capable you are, since you dare to bluster with your wild arrogance!\u201dThe cloud-like [Polar Ice Flames] surged towards the woman like tides.The woman snorted as she suddenly rose up, and disappeared into the mass of clouds. After a long moment her voice rang out, \u201cCome and fight up here, don\u2019t harm the innocent.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201d Beiming Shang shouted, his body also shooting high above the sky, and disappeared in the clouds.Thundering roars came from the heavens, as if it was the end of the world.Everyone in the arena knew that Beiming Shang had started fighting with the mysterious woman, but sadly, no one could see this fight.\u201cBoom boom boom!\u201dThe two towering men had, by then, surrounded Mo Tuo, and ruthlessly started beating him.These two big men were like iron giants, their bodies extremely sturdy. They weren\u2019t afraid of the arms thick strands of lightning, and kept bombarding Mo Tuo in the midst of the lightning strikes.Strikes of lightning flew in the sky like an electrical dragon. The lightning came from Mo Tuo, fifteen strands in total, and they formed a closely-knit electrical web, charging at the towering giant men.\u201cMo Tuo! Give up the treasure map, or else don\u2019t blame me for attacking the Mo family members!\u201dMu Xun\u2019s voice came from a corner of the arena. He had brought a group of masters from the Medicine Valley, and walked towards Mo Tuo step by step, his expression grim.\u201cMu Xun! The treasure map isn\u2019t with the Mo family! Release Chaoge now, or else you\u2019re not going to walk out of Tianyun City alive!\u201d Mo Tuo was furious, even under the joined forces of the two giant men, he could still give out threats.\u201cAlright then! You forced me to do this!\u201d Mu Xun\u2019s voice was cold, and he said to the Medicine Valley masters beside him, \u201cKill everyone in the Mo family!\u201dThen Mu Xun also sprinted out, his body like a beam of light, he joined the forces of the two giant men and bombarded Mo Tuo.\u201cPop pop pop! Boom boom boom!\u201dThe electrical dragon moved around in the sky. The two towering giant men were like monstrous beasts. One of them grabbed two millstone sized Green Iron pieces, and whenever he got near Mo Tuo he would throw the thousand-jin piece of Green Iron at Mo Tuo.TL Note: A Jin \u65a4 is a little more than a pound.In a short moment, the whole arena was filled with lightning and flying stones. Fire spread everywhere and silver lights scurried around.In the crowd, those that were struck by the electric dragon turned into a crisp, while those that were struck by the stones turned into a pulp.The fight among these masters had turned everything into chaos!Many of the warriors cursed, shrieked and roared as they all tried to get out of the way.Those with low capability simply escaped the God Stone Square in a panic, afraid to stay and watch the show.The masters from Medicine Valley took advantage of the situation and stormed towards the Mo family, attacking its descendents and warriors.However, the Mo family\u2019s descendents and warriors were undaunted. They weren\u2019t afraid of the Medicine Valley\u2019s attacks, and firmly suppressed those that came at them.Now Shi Jian actually seemed like an outsider.In the arena he watched the Mo family suffer in surprise, but inside, he was as delighted as ever.\u201cGrandpa, do it now!\u201d Shi Jian stepped forward, and said firmly.\u201cDo it now?\u201d Shi Jian froze, then furrowed his brows: \u201cYou mean?\u201d\u201cMo Zhan is dead. Mo Tuo will surely seek vengeance! Rather than letting the Mo family recover and strike us, why not take advantage of their weakness! You can cooperate with Mu Xun and those two to kill Mo Tuo while we will hunt down the second and third generations of the Mo family. It\u2019s best if we completely cripple the entire Mo family today, so they would never have a chance of revenge.\u201d Shi Yan said cruelly.\u201cBig brother! Shi Yan is right! Mo Zhan is already dead and Mo Chaoge is probably not going to live either! At this point, we should just screw it all and do it! Screw the Martial Competition, take out the Mo family first!\u201d Shi Tie came up and growled.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Tian Luo and Shi Tian Yun were both heavily injured, still laying on the ground. He had already suppressed his anger, but now that the perfect chance was here, Shi Tie couldn\u2019t hold himself back anymore.Han Feng was also here, and he nodded at Shi Jian.\u201cBeiming Shang is kept busy right now, so the Beiming family has no one in charge. Without his permission, no one in the Beiming family would help the Mo family. This is a golden opportunity! If we miss this chance we\u2019ll never get it again!\u201d Shi Yan gave in another word of encouragement and said, \u201cGrandpa, you guys kill Mo Tuo, and I will take care of Mo Qi and Mo Yanyu, who severely wounded brother Tian Luo and brother Tian Yun. We can entirely destroy the Mo family bloodline!\u201d\u201cKid, you sure are ruthless enough!\u201d Shi Tie smacked Shi Yan, and before Shi Jian agreed he rushed out and shouted, \u201cMo Tuo, you old dog, today you will die for sure!\u201dOnce Shi Tie exited, Shi Jian stopped hesitating and said to Han Feng, \u201cIdiot, protect Shi Yan!\u201d Then he also stormed out and roared, \u201cMo Tuo! It\u2019s time to settle it between us!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Those that Mu Xun brought from Medicine Valley also hounded people from the Mo family.In the Shi family\u2019s area, once Shi Jian and Shi Yan took action, the masters of the Shi family also sprinted up and attacked the Mo family members.In a short moment, the arena broke out into a war.None of the warriors who came to watch the Martial Competition expected the event to go down this way.When the big fight erupted, many furious powers vented out their enmity and ruthlessly attacked their enemies, embroiling many innocents. Because of this, in just few minutes, a number of warriors were sent to their death.The bystanders could no longer sit still.Seeing the two families slaughtering each other, very few people decided to stay and continue watching. They all hurriedly retreated from the God Stone Square, afraid that they might become a target in the slaughterhouse.The retreat of the bystanders was very swift. Now the only people present in the God Stone Square were those from the five big families.The Beijing family was merely the observers. In the absence of Beiming Shang, the Beiming family decided to only be a spectator, not aiding either of the families.Beiming Ce stood in silence in the Beiming family\u2019s tower. He was closely watching the besieged Mo Tuo, and occasionally gazed at the Mo family members who were attacked by the Shi family.\u201cYoung master, what should we do? Keep watching?\u201dBeiming Ce\u2019s eyes flashed coldly as he spoke, \u201cMmmhmm, we don\u2019t need to entangle ourselves in this dog fight. Let them chase among themselves; whatever the outcome, it wouldn\u2019t affect us in the least. We will directly curb the one who loses in the end and take away their inheritance. With our influence in the Merchant Union, we will be the prime benefactors.\u201d\u201cYou are wise, Young Master. But, should we stay?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201d Beiming Ce suddenly smiled, \u201cLet\u2019s go back, staying and doing nothing wouldn\u2019t be that great after all. We\u2019re not joining the fight anyway, so let\u2019s go back and arrange things a little. Let\u2019s go.\u201dUpon hearing that, all the masters from the Beiming family nodded in unison. Led by Beiming Ce, they all retreated from the God Stone Square.Now, in the arena, only four families remained: Zuo, Ling, Mo and Shi. The Shi and Mo families were fighting, while the Zuo and Ling families were merely the spectators.Unknowingly, Shi Yang arrived at where the Zuo family was. He bowed to Zuo Xu and said, \u201cUncle Zuo, I hope you could please keep an eye on the Ling family during this fight.\u201dZuo Xu casually replied while sipping his tea, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Zuo and Ling families always had feud between us. If the Ling family dares to make a move, we won\u2019t be sit still either. Rest assured and do whatever your Shi family wants. The Ling family won\u2019t be problem for you.\u201d\u201cThank you, Uncle Zuo.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, whether it be business or personal affairs, the Zuo family and the Shi family have always been allies; of course we would take some pressure for you.\u201d Zuo Xu nonchalantly said. He gazed at where the Shi family was assembled, and asked in confusion, \u201cWhere\u2019s Shi Yan, that little brat? Why haven\u2019t I seen him?\u201dShi Yang was surprised and also looked around, realizing that there truly was no sign of Shi Yan. He shook his head and gave a wry smile, \u201cThat kid was just there, now who knows where he\u2019s gone.\u201d\u201cWatch that kid! The brat is very good, he\u2019s gonna be the future hope of your Shi family, you can\u2019t afford to lose him.\u201d Zuo Xu said.\u201cHaha, Uncle Han Feng is keeping an eye on him, no need to worry, Uncle Zuo.\u201d\u201cHmm, alright then.\u201d Zuo Xu smiled, and while glancing at Zuo Shi next to him, his smile looked a little strange, \u201cXiao Shi is also quite fond of your Shi Yan.\u201dShi Yang\u2019s expression bloomed, and he nodded: \u201cI\u2019ll be going then, Uncle Zuo.\u201dWhen Shi Yang was gone, Zuo Shi\u2019s face flashed in confusion, and she said, \u201cGrandpa, when was I fond of that guy? What are you bullshitting about? Sending that Dragon Turtle Armor was your idea too, it wasn\u2019t just me who wanted to help him, sheesh.\u201d\u201cHaha, whatever, same thing.\u201d Zuo Xu seemed like he was in a good mood, and he told the Zuo family members, \u201cWe will stay here for now and watch the Ling family for the Shi\u2019s. If the Ling family dares to get involved, we don\u2019t need to act kindly to them either. Hehe, after today, the situation in the Merchant Union is really going to turn upside down. We can\u2019t let the Ling family take any benefits.\u201dAt the Ling family\u2019s side, the head of the family, Ling Jue, frowned silently.The masters of the Ling family were all standing behind Ling Jue. Seeing that he hadn\u2019t spoken yet, these people were all on guard, as if silently waiting for his decision.At the Mo family\u2019s place, all their members were surrounded by the people from Medicine Valley and the Shi family. Their situation was turning from bad to worse.Suddenly, Mo Chao Tian broke through and quickly rushed to Ling Jue\u2019s side; kneeling down on one knee he spoke in panic, \u201cUncle Ling, please let the Ling family step in! My father is besieged by many masters, he might not last long. We are also being chased by people from Medicine Valley and the Shi family, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to hold up. Uncle Ling, for old time\u2019s sake, please help our family, the entire Mo family will always remember your favor.\u201dLing Jue furrowed his brows and lightly sighed. He said in frustration, \u201cChao Tian, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help, but the Zuo family hasn\u2019t made a move yet. Once our family gives aid, the Zuo family will immediately spring up. The reason why I haven\u2019t done anything yet is because I\u2019m watching the Zuo family for you guys.\u201d\u201cBut if this continues, the Mo family might not be able to withstand it any longer!\u201d Mo Chao Tian said in fear.\u201cIf the Ling family cuts in now, it would force the Zuo family to get involved too; it would be useless.\u201d Ling Jue shook his head. He hesitated for a moment and then shouted: \u201cShao Feng! Bring some people and bring Yanyu back here. Yanyu is your future wife, she can\u2019t die!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d Ling Shao Feng called out and fiercely sprinted out, accompanied by some of the warriors from the Ling family.\u201cChao Tian, Yanyu is your daughter, and the daughter-in-law of the Ling family. I will protect her for you. As for the rest, sigh, I really can\u2019t help. I can only promise you that I will make sure the Zuo family won\u2019t step in to go against the Mo family, this is all I can do.\u201d Ling Jue said in frustration.Mo Chao Tian was in a daze. He deeply gazed at Ling Jue, and after quite a while finally turned away in grief, silently returning to the Mo family\u2019s battle.\u201cBig brother\u2026\u201d Ling Jie Qing whispered hesitantly. He said, \u201cIf we don\u2019t help, the Mo family will definitely lose heavily this time. Mo Tuo might develop a hatred for us.\u201dLing Jue\u2019s expression was calm as he sat there and lightly took a sip of tea. He lowered his head and said, \u201cYounger brother, at this time, we cannot be reckless. Zuo Xu won\u2019t easily let us join the fight. Besides, the Misty Pavilion has a Sky Realm master. She is going against the Mo family, if our family steps in, we won\u2019t get anything good out of this. Also, this is an opportunity, Mo Zhan is dead, and Mo Qi is in danger. Yanyu will be the hope of the third generation of the Mo family. If Yanyu becomes our family\u2019s daughter-in-law, our Ling family can openly take the Mo family\u2019s properties when they get in a dangerous situation. And if one day Yanyu becomes the head of the Mo family, with her status as the daughter in law of the Ling family, hehe\u2026\u201d\u201cGood scheming, big brother.\u201d Ling Jie was stunned for a while, then he finally nodded, \u201cI was thoughtless, big brother. You are one that strongly considers the future.\u201d\u201cYes, we only need to protect Yanyu, the rest we don\u2019t need to care about.\u201d Ling Jue raised his head, and squinted towards the fight in mid air, saying, \u201cWhen Yanyu gets here, we can go back. This time the odds are against Mo Tuo.\u201d He sighed, \u201cWho would\u2019ve known that the Misty Pavilion hid a Sky Realm master, Brother Mo, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t care about our friendship, just that you\u2019re truly in back luck.\u201d\u201cGrandpa Ling! I beg you to save my grandpa!\u201d Mo Yanyu was brought back. Once she arrived at the Ling family\u2019s side, she immediately knelt down, tears marks streaked down the sides of her cheeks, \u201cIf you don\u2019t help now, my grandpa might not be able to last long! Grandpa Ling, please! As long as you give in your aid, I will marry Shao Feng right now!\u201d\u201cYanyu, it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to help, I just really can\u2019t.\u201d Ling Jue shook his head. He stood up and said, \u201cIn the future you will understand the painstaking decisions I am making now. Everything I am doing is for you and Shao Feng! Brother, take away Yanyu, we are going home.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Ling Jie suddenly appeared behind Mo Yanyu. He hit her once, and the breathlessly crying Mo Yanyu suddenly went limp and fainted.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHead of the Zuo family, I think that this Martial Competition can go on no more. Hmm, we are going back in advance, how about the Zuo family?\u201d Ling Jue looked at the far away Zuo Xu and shouted loudly.Zuo Xu was surprised, then secretly cursed out at the old fox. He also smilingly stood up and said: \u201cWe were also going to go, why, should we go together?\u201d\u201cSure thing, I was just going to chat a little bit with master Zuo, then we shall go together?\u201c Ling Jue nodded and replied with a smile.In the arena, the Ling and Zuo families had been sitting still as mountains. However, at this crucial moment, as if they did not see the chaos inside the arena, the two heads of the families walked side by side, and with their subordinates behind them, headed straight out of the God Stone Square.Those remaining in the God Stone Square were only the onlookers who thought that they were strong enough to bear the aftershocks of the battle, the Mo family, the Shi family and the people from the Medicine Valley.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His presence would cause the body to completely dry up and become devoid of any Profound Qi in mere seconds.Because of the devastating battle, many nearby warriors felt the brunt of it.Those warriors of Elementary and Nascent realms were the most affected, for they couldn\u2019t block the aftershocks from the battle between the Nirvana Realm warriors. Once they became entangled in their battle, there was no hope for them.In just a few minutes, Shi Yan roamed around the God Stone Square and harvested all the Profound Qi from seven Elementary Realm and four Nascent Realm warriors.Only Human Realm warriors were somewhat lucky to escape, as they could withstand the aftershocks generated from the battle, not receiving any life threatening wounds.Therefore, there wasn\u2019t any corpses of a Human Realm warrior, which was very disappointing to Shi Yan.Due to the mysterious power that could absorb the Profound Qi from the corpses into his meridians, Shi Yan hoped for more chaos. He was continually encouraging Shi Jain to fight against the Mo family in person so to increase the casualties, enabling him to enter the Human Realm faster.Han Feng was lingering ten meters away from him like a ghost.Wherever he went, Han Feng would follow him like a shadow, least he created some trouble.Ten meters away, Han Feng was staring at Shi Yan with eyes filled with confusion.During the nasty battle, Shi Yan was acting weirdly. Han Feng couldn\u2019t figure out what Shi Yan was pondering; he didn\u2019t ask as he was just there to protect his young master in case of an accident.Shuttling through the God Stone Square, Shi Yan would always stand beside the corpses for a while.Although he saw the corpses undergoing some strange changes, Han Feng didn\u2019t care about it as he thought those dead warriors must have been poisoned and it was just taking effect now.He never could have thought that such strange changes were actually caused by Shi Yan.\u201cAhhh!\u201dNot far from Shi Yan, the God Stone suddenly collapsed and a painful cry was heard.Hearing the cry, Shi Yan became ecstatic and he rushed over.Under that collapsed God Stone, a Nascent Realm warrior was taking his last breaths.The warrior was unfortunately hit by one of Mo Tuo\u2019s lightning bolts, however he seemed to possess some sort of defensive Martial Skill which had sustained him till now.Shi Yan looked indifferent when standing beside the collapsed structure. Even from ten meters away, Shi Yan could feel the highly dense Nascent Realm Profound Qi coming from the injured warrior.In just a few minutes, the warrior was sucked dry and Shi Yan harvested another batch of Profound Qi.Han Feng was secretly watching Shi Yan in confusion from another corner of that collapsed stone.It\u2019s so weird. Has anyone been using poison? Why did they all die in such a strange way?\u201d Shi Yan shook his head and looked up at Han Feng, \u201cUncle Han, there must be someone here in the arena with his own purpose.\u201dHan Feng nodded with approval, but was still perplexed.\u201cPaa!\u201dLightning, as thick as an arm, flew over like a dragon and hit the structure heavily.\u201cChee chee chee!\u201dAs the lightning flashed on the collapsed structure, a layer of dim moonlight suddenly came out of that mountain-like stone.That dim moonlight had created a strange but cool atmosphere, but the moonlight quickly disappeared and everything returned to normal.Shi Yan and Han Feng, who were standing near that structure, had watched the whole process.\u201cMmm!\u201dShi Yan let out a soft sound and walked towards that collapsed structure frowning. He stretched out a hand and pressed on this mysterious stone.Under the blazing sun, the stone was cool to the touch. It was as if the stone had been accumulating moonlight over thousand years and was carrying the coolness of the night.And it was as heavy as an average metal.Sensing it for a while, Shi Yan couldn\u2019t find anything out of the ordinary about the stone. He released his hand and asked Han Feng, frowning, \u201cUncle Han, did you see the stone shining for a few seconds just moments ago?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Han Feng nodded softly and walked up as well. He touched the legendary stone himself and remarked, \u201cNo change, maybe it\u2019s because Mo Tuo\u2019s lightning struck it just now.\u201d\u201cYeah, it must have something to do with Mo Tuo\u2019s Lighting Martial Spirit.\u201d Shi Yan agreed as he couldn\u2019t figure out anything special. There was still a bit of suspicion left in his mind, however since he couldn\u2019t come up with anything now, he didn\u2019t give it a further thought.\u201cMo Family members! Disperse and go home!\u201d Suddenly, from the battle arena, came Mo Tuo\u2019s angry order.Shi Yan looked in the direction from where the sound came.Under the relentless attacks, Mo Tuo looked to be in a difficult situation; his back was severely bleeding and he seemed to be heavily wounded.He didn\u2019t continue to fight after Shi Tie\u2019s severe strike and dashed towards the far away commercial street in a hurry.Mu Xun, Shi Tie and Shi Jian immediately gave a chase without saying a word.Those two tower-like men hesitated for a second, but ultimately stood in the center of the arena, not intending to kill anymore.Those Mo family members also didn\u2019t dare stay in the arena after Mo Tuo\u2019s command, running away in all directions separately.Shi Yan was calmly standing behind the God Stone and watching the surroundings. He saw the old man with unkempt hair from Poisonous Dragon Valley jealously protecting Mo Qi with Li Han, running towards a block of houses to the south of the God Stone Square..\u201cWe can\u2019t let Mo Qi live.\u201d Shi Yan took a deep breath and said to Han Feng, \u201cIf the grass\u2019 root isn\u2019t pulled out, it will grow when spring comes. We have to take out Mo Qi.\u201dIf the grass\u2019 root isn\u2019t pulled out, it will grow when spring comes.Han Feng frowned and repeated that sentence twice, and finally understood. His eyes sparkled as he softly said, \u201cYoung Master Yan is indeed capable of great things\u201dWithout saying anything, Shi Yan walked away from the fallen God Stone and gave chase after Mo Qi.Shi Yan soon exited the God Stone Square. Just as he was about to enter the narrow streets between the houses, he found Shi Yang and some Shi family members chase from behind too.\u201cBig Uncle, I will take care of Mo Qi, you go after the others.\u201d Shi Yan yelled from afar.Shi Yang was stunned as he saw it was Shi Yan who was giving chase. He reprimanded, \u201cWhere have you been till now? Don\u2019t you know it\u2019s chaos in the arena? Your grandpa will peel my skin if you have an accident!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine.\u201d Han Feng appeared from behind Shi Yan and responded softly.Seeing Han Feng behind Shi Yan, Shi Yang relaxed and smiled, \u201cWell, you go after Mo Qi and I will go after Mo Chao Tian.\u201dThen he nodded at Han Feng, ran up to another road, and dashed away.\u2014A quarter of an hour later.On a small street in the south region, Mo Qi was in a murderous mood as he focused on running.Suddenly a shadow appeared in front of him.At the corner of the street ahead, Shi Yan leaned against the tone wall with a sneering smile on his face, and said casually, \u201cMo Qi, are you tired? Yeah, you can have a rest now.\u201dMo Qi suddenly stopped with a ferocious face, \u201cShi Yan! You killed my brother, you must pay for it!\u201d\u201cPay for it?\u201d Shi Yan\u2019s mouth widened and shook his head, \u201cMo Zhan is not too far away, you may catch up to him if you are fast enough. I came to see you away.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Qi!\u201d Li Han showed up from behind Mo Qi, and beside Li Han stood the Bloody Hand, from Poisonous Dragon Valley of the God-blessed Empire.\u201cKill him!\u201d Mo Qi pointed at Shi Yan and said angrily, \u201cHe has to die!\u201d\u201cLet the younger generation solve their own problem. You\u2019d better not get involved.\u201d Han Feng suddenly popped up his head from a house, looking at Bloody Hand and Li Han coldly.\u201cBloody Hand from Poisonous Dragon Valley?\u201d Shi Yan gazed at that old man and suddenly remarked, \u201cYou refined that Blood Qi Pill? Well, Poisonous Dragon Valley is literally the cradle of degenerate alchemists who only know how to make degenerate pills.\u201d\u201cKid, you are seeking death!\u201d Bloody Hand frowned as his face turned rigid suddenly. He grunted, \u201cI had no qualms about getting involved in your Shi family and Mo family matter. But now that you are so arrogant, how about tasting my Poisonous Dragon Valley skill?\u201d\u201cYoung Master Yan, you take care of Mo Qi, Bloody Hand and Li Han are mine.\u201d Han Feng announced softly and flew down from the roof as light as a feather and stood between Bloody Hand and Li Han.\u201cHehe, you think we, Poisonous Dragon Valley, are that lame?\u201d Bloody Hand smiled cunningly and immediately swallowed a strange pill, which was as big as a longan, and as crimson as blood.After having that pill, Bloody Hand\u2019s eyes suddenly turned red and his jumbled hair stood at its ends, while dense smell of blood came from his body.Han Feng\u2019s face changed suddenly, \u201cYoung master Yan, go home right now!\u201d\u201cLi Han, Mo Qi, kill that arrogant kid. I will take care of the old man.\u201d Bloody Hand broadened his mouth in a smile, and licked his lips with a horrifying expression.\u201cUncle Han, be careful.\u201d Shi Yan was on alert as he realized something strange from Bloody Hand\u2019s change. He took a glance at Han Feng and Mo Qi, and ran towards the Green Moon Lake as fast as possible.Before Han Feng could take off, Bloody Hand dashed forward and an intense bloody air suddenly enveloped him and prevented him from leaving.Li Han and Mo Qi looked at each other and chased in Shi Yan\u2019s direction without a word.\u2014Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFive minutes later.On another street, Li Han and Mo Qi paused suddenly. Mo Qi said with a ferocious face, \u201cKid you are not running away? Are you tired of living?\u201d\u201cI had said I will stop your Mo family from having descendents! I can\u2019t break my promise.\u201d Shi Yan stood at the entrance of the street, looking grim.Wisps of white smoke were suddenly emitted from his body. The negative energy gushing from him gave off a murderous impression, like he was a bloody God of Slaughter from the Shura Blood Sea.Since Han Feng was not with him, he could finally use his real ability now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were invisible and traceless as no one else except for him could detect them.Negative energy poured out from his meridians and filled his whole body. Shi Yan\u2019s once sturdy body clearly became a lot thinner.This was the first time that Shi Yan completely displayed [Rampage].The biggest change he felt was that his spiritual sense could now perceive the slightest details and his mind was absolute calm.Li Han slightly furrowed his brows. Looking at Shi Yan in front of him he always felt a little recognition, but when he thought deeply, he couldn\u2019t remember where he recognised him from.On Mo Qi\u2019s two arms, strands of lightning as thick as fingers were formed, and his facial expressions became more and more ferocious.\u201cUncle Li!\u201d Mo Qi roared.Li Han\u2019s expression froze, his body suddenly popped loudly. The sounds of his joints were like waves hitting upon the shore, gushing with momentum.\u201cWhoosh whoosh whoosh!\u201dA swirl of wave-like white lights swiftly flowed out from Li Han\u2019s body.Li Han\u2019s hands constantly pulled at the void space, and those white lights were like actual tides, stirring waves in thin air, and it abruptly rolled towards Shi Yan.\u201c[Sea Cloud Roll]!\u201dLi Han stood firmly and yelled with a serious face.In front of him, the waves folded in layers. Between him and Shi Yan there was suddenly a choppy river flow, the crushing waters in the river was controlled by his will, as if he wanted to drown Shi Yan right in front of him.\u201cRoar!\u201dMo Qi growled and the strands of lightning wrapped around his arms became tongue-flicking snakes. They slithered above the waves and charged towards Shi Yan while releasing electric flashes.Shi Yan\u2019s heart was still as clear as a mirror. He remained unmoved from the oncoming attacks.Just when the waves formed from Profound Qi were five meters away from him, Shi Yan suddenly took three steps back, his body submerged into the previously formed [Gravitational Fields].Controlled by his will, the two [Gravitational Fields] on his left and right suddenly drifted a few meters forward and suddenly merged together!\u201cThump thump! Bzz bzz bzz!\u201dThe [Sea Cloud Rolls] released by Li Han and the electric snakes from Mo Qi directly clashed into the middle of the big [Gravitational Field] that was formed by the two smaller ones. Weird sounds came from inside that [Gravitational Field].Those [Sea Cloud Rolls], formed by Profound Qi under a special martial skill, all of a sudden strangely turned into thin mists. It was as if the Profound Qi was dissolved in the [Gravitational Field] and became natural energies, dissipating into the earth.The electrical snakes shot into the [Gravitational Field], as if influenced by the strange whirlpool. These snakes actually became intertwined and continuously whirled in that area. They just weren\u2019t able to escape the restraints of the [Gravitational Field].In Li Han and Mo Qi\u2019s eyes, it looked as if their attacks were stopped in mid-air. With their attacks unable to move forward, this appeared very strange to them.The two froze. Confused by the sudden development, they were both caught off guard.Shi Yan\u2019s murderous attempts were always clear. When noticing that the [Gravitational Field] was enough to stop the attacks of the two opponents, his mind was struck with an amazing idea.He moved the [Gravitational Field] that stopped the attacks and slowly pushed it forward!Now the swirling electric snakes were quickly charging towards Li Han and Mo Qi.Li Han\u2019s expression changed, he finally realized it was Shi Yan who was secretly manipulating their attacks. He quickly stopped his Martial Skill and pulled out a sharp silver-white sword from his waist.Once the sharp sword was in his hands, it looked as if it was tinted with a layer of color. The sword suddenly turned a strange light purple color, with purple marks appearing on the blade.Li Han flicked his wrist and all of a sudden, the sword shone with a bright purple light. A three meter long fierce purple aura suddenly shot from the tip of the sword.With a straight face, Li Han shouted, and raised his sword to strike down.\u201cBzz bzz!\u201dThe sword aura and the blade directly slashed onto the [Gravitational Field].But the [Gravitational Field] remained unaffected. The lightning that came from Mo Qi was still suspended from above, and all at once, dropped onto Li Han.Li Han shouted in pain, and hurriedly tried to retreat.Shi Yan suddenly moved!Like a thrusted spear, Shi Yan\u2019s body stabbed straight towards Mo Qi.Mo Qi\u2019s expression changed, and he hurriedly backed away in fear.\u201cMo Qi!\u201d Shi Yan roared while coming towards Mo Qi.Mo Qi instinctively looked towards Shi Yan.Endless bloodlust was shown inside Shi Yan\u2019s eyes; it looked as if countless evil spirits were about to fly out of his pupils. Those evil spirits were drenched in blood; you could even clearly see their fragmented hearts in the chests as they rushed to pounce at Mo Qi.Mo Qi was suddenly stunned, he blanked out in this crucial moment, right where he stood.\u201cPuchi!\u201dThe five fingers on Shi Yan\u2019s left hand were like a sharp blade, stabbing right into Mo Qi\u2019s chest, and pierced his heart in one strike. Shi Yan\u2019s five fingers came straight out of Mo Qi\u2019s back.Mo Qi shook under the piercing pain, his eyes instantly turned back and his consciousness returned.\u201cMo Zhan is still waiting on the death road for you, take care.\u201d Shi Yan looked at him emotionlessly, and abruptly drew out the hand from his chest.\u201cWhoosh!\u201dBlood gushed out from Mo Qi\u2019s chest like a river bursting at its banks. Shi Yan quickly dodged the blood flow.\u201cThump!\u201dMo Qi\u2019s life force was extinguished, and he fell on his back with blood still endlessly rushing out his chest.\u201cYoung Master Qi!\u201dLi Han, who was numbed by the lightning, screamed out loud, his face full of terror. It was as if he couldn\u2019t believe how Shi Yan got rid of Mo Qi so fast.\u201cDon\u2019t yell, he\u2019ll be waiting ahead for you too.\u201d Shi Yan turned around, he suddenly raised that blood-covered left hand, and waved it at Li Han. \u201cThis is the blood from Mo Qi\u2019s heart, do you want to know how it tastes like?\u201dLi Han\u2019s face suddenly changed, and he shouted, \u201cShi Yan, you\u2019re seeking your own demise! You\u2019re only at the Nascent Realm, you have no chance against me!\u201d\u201cAre you trying to add courage to yourself, with your capability that\u2019s higher than my Nascent Realm? It\u2019s no use, today I will use you to break into the threshold of the Human Realm!\u201dUsing his mind, Shi Yan\u2019s silently shifted the [Gravitational Field] to beside Li Han and suddenly enveloped him within it.In mere seconds, Li Han felt like he was in the deepest whirlpools in the ocean, his body uncontrollably swaying along with the whirlpool.Even his Profound Qi was no longer in his control.\u201cBack when we were in the Stone Woods, I already wanted to kill you, but you released the blue smoke bomb before I could.\u201d Shi Yan walked towards him step by step, his body wrapped in white, fabric-like mist. He took a quick step and flew out into the [Gravitational Field].Once he entered the whirlpool, the white mist that was present in the whirlpool quickly entered Li Han\u2019s body under the rapid rotations.\u201cYou! Ding Yan! You are Ding Yan!!\u201d Li Han\u2019s expression changed, he suddenly screamed.\u201cIt was the Mo family that took action first, you can\u2019t blame me for being harsh.\u201d Shi Yan hopped into the center of the whirlpool, standing closely in front of Li Han, his blade-like fingers grabbing Li Han\u2019s throat.\u201cCrack!\u201dThe crisp sound of bones breaking came from Li Han\u2019s neck, as he died unwillingly.The [Gravitational Field] quickly disappeared!The negative energy filled with the fear, desperation, and loathing from Li Han and Mo Qi all flowed into the meridians in Shi Yan\u2019s body.In a minute, both Li Han and Mo Qi became two dry corpses, their Profound Qi gone without a trace.Shi Yan took a deep breath. He let his mind calm down, and closed his eyes to listen to his surroundings, there was not a single sound.One hand carrying Li Han and another with Mo Qi, Shi Yan ran swiftly along the alley. He sprinted through the alley like a ghost.\u2014Ten minutes later.Shi Yan arrived at the Moon Lake, in an area where no one went to. He threw the corpses of Li Han and Mo Qi into the lake, watching the two corpses sinking to the bottom.The look on Li Han and Mo Qi\u2019s dead bodies was too obvious. To prevent anyone from noticing his secret, he had to properly take care of their corpses.At this sensitive time, he couldn\u2019t reveal his identity.The Beiming family was still trying to find him.To look out for the Beiming family, he had to continue hiding his true identity. He could only take care of business more conveniently while in the dark.\u201cSplash!\u201dAs Shi Yan was standing there in a daze, a breathtakingly gorgeous face suddenly appeared in the middle of the Moon Lake.This was a startling beauty, her temperament was elegant, noble, and extraordinary, like a goddess of the Moon Lake that came down from the heavens.This woman was wearing a black crape, the crap now clung tightly to her perfect figure, revealing her most tempting curves. Now that stunning body rose slowly to the surface of the lake, like a beautiful bright moon.Her body surfaced from Moon Lake. Once that figure completely rose from the waters, she stepped on the lake water, her beautiful brows slightly furrowed, she walked towards the shore with elegant grace.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShi Yan stared with wide eyes, this was the first time he was truly intoxicated by a woman\u2019s beauty.This woman, whether it be her body, temperament, or beauty, was completely on another level compared to Mu Yu Die.\u201cThe mysterious woman!\u201dJust when the woman was about to walk up onto the shore, Shi Yan\u2019s heart shook, and he suddenly realized who this woman was.The unknown Sky Realm master who appeared above the arena.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just as she was about to reach the bank, that mysterious woman suddenly trembled and fainted.Shi Yan quickly realized that she must have been severely injured by Beiming Shang.After realizing this, Shi Yan immediately rushed towards the lake and caught the mysterious woman before she could drown.The touch of that exquisite body intoxicated Shi Yan so much so that he was barely able to bring the woman up onto the bank.Shi Yan felt for breath under her nose and found her to be breathing steadily; there was a strange energy growing in her and nourishing her body bit by bit.As the bloodthirsty desire welled up in his mind, Shi Yan\u2019s quickly realized he was in a precarious situation as the negative energy was on the verge of exploding.He had absorbed too much negative energy and as it was at the crucial period of purification, his meridians were emitting greater amounts of negative energy.Holding this mysterious woman in his arms, Shi Yan\u2019s expression shifted continuously.After a long while, Shi Yan finally came up with an idea.He tore a piece of cloth from his coat and covered the woman\u2019s gorgeous face, then directly ran to a brothel with the woman in his arms.The mysterious woman was a Sky Realm warrior and she had been injured by Beiming Shang. Therefore, she would be considered to be an enemy of Beiming Family!In the Merchant Union, the Beiming Family was still the most influential power, as no other family could compete with them for now.This woman was so mysterious and her cultivation realm was high; Beiming Shang would be very unsettled as long as this woman was alive.Shi Yan was determined to let her live on!Tonight, Tianyun City would not be tranquil. Beiming Shang would certainly send out his experts to search for this woman, and Shi Yan would have to protect her until she woke up.As the negative energy in him grew stronger and stronger, and as he had such a beautiful woman in his arms, he was barely able to control his desires.However, he knew that he couldn\u2019t do anything to the woman, or the Shi family would be annihilated after she woke up!\u2014A quarter of an hour later.Carrying that mysterious woman with her face covered, Shi Yan directly walked into the Misty Rain House, in the south of the Tianyun City, and yelled, \u201cMadam, get me two pretty girls! Quickly!\u201d\u201cHua! Hua! Hua!\u201dShining purple crystal coins rolled out of Shi Yan\u2019s pocket onto the counter of the first floor of the Misty Rain House.\u201cComing!\u201dA 30 some years old sexy woman with heavy makeup and a professional smile on her face popped her head out from upstairs.After a quick glimpse at the purple crystal coins, she burst into loud laughter, and replied happily, \u201cMaster, please come up the third floor, I will arrange the girls for you right away!\u201d\u201cGood.\u201dShi Yan nodded and followed the woman up to the third floor with the unknown woman in his arms.\u201cYan Yun, Rou, hurry up! Come to Room No.3 and give this master your best!\u201d The brothel Madam laughed seductively and showed Shi Yan into a room, as she shouted to the girls.\u201cMadam, we will be there right away!\u201dFrom the room at the upstairs corner came a sweet response.Before long, two pretty teenage girls with seductive eyes entered Shi Yan\u2019s room.\u201cMaster, you brought another girl with you? Huh? You think the girls in my Misty Rain House can\u2019t satisfy you?\u201d The Madam stood in the room and examined the mysterious woman with her sophisticated eyes and couldn\u2019t help but giggle, \u201cYou are very interesting! I\u2019ve never seen anyone bring a girl by himself.\u201d\u201cHmm, I\u2019m rather powerful at \u2018that\u2019 and have special tastes. It would be more fun to have one that I brought!\u201d Shi Yan glanced at the Madam and said indifferently.The Madam kept smiling and looked at the mysterious woman again, smiling knowingly to herself.Naturally, she guessed that the woman must have been grabbed by Shi Yan and he was going to take her virginity in the Misty Rain House. In case that woman couldn\u2019t endure it the first time, he got two girls to satisfy him.The Madam had seen such occasions many times, so she could handle it easily. She nodded and said, \u201cYan Yun, Rou, take care of this master. And try your best to satisfy him!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry Madam. We\u2019ve been in this industry for so long, we know how to make our clients happy.\u201d That girl called Yan Yun looked at Shi Yan with a big smile and softly licked her lips, \u201cMaster, I will make you comfortable.\u201d\u201cYou disappear!\u201d Shi Yan couldn\u2019t suppress his desires anymore. After a deep breath, he yelled to the Madam.\u201cGreat! Master, enjoy yourself! Call me whenever you need more girls.\u201d The Madam seductively turned around and walked back to the door with a face full of smiles, and considerately closed the door.Shi Yan then put the woman onto the soft carpet.Putting one of his hands on the woman\u2019s back, Shi Yan found that the strange power in her had already flowed over her whole body, speeding up the circulation of her Profound Qi.Furrowing his brows, Shi Yan quickly figured out that this woman must have taken some rare pills, which were taking effect even while she was unconscious. The pills were recovering her injuries quickly and making her Profound Qi operate automatically, in order to wake her up as soon as possible.\u201cYou two, come with me.\u201dSo many streams of negative energy were gushing out from his meridians and he couldn\u2019t stand it anymore. Quickly, he wrapped the two girls in his arms and pushed them onto the bed, which was covered with a red quilt.\u2014After an unknowingly long time.Slowly, Shi Yan woke up to find his eyes extremely clear, as he could now precisely feel the wisps of mysterious energy coming out from his meridians.Part of the mysterious energy had seeped in his blood, flesh, bones and veins, and the remainder had congregated in his dantain.This mysterious energy had made his Profound Qi become extremely dense and fresh.Under the control of his will, his Profound Qi was boiling in his body like a spring tide.Holding his breath, Shi Yan went into meditation, clearing his mind of any thoughts and letting his Profound Qi flow freely in his body.\u2014After a long time, Shi Yan\u2019s body shook, and he immediately woke up.His senses were different all of a sudden.Closing his eyes, Shi Yan could clearly sense the essence of the air between heaven and earth. The essence was everywhere in the air, though he couldn\u2019t sense it before.But at this moment, he could clearly perceive its invisible movements!His Profound Qi had become extremely accurate as well, as it would fly out swiftly from the middle finger of his left hand at his will.With a thought, his Profound Qi skipped continuously. It came to life and turned into a blade of grass, a magic snake, and then a flying worm.Feeling the essence in the air, and refining everything in the world.This was Human Realm!Shi Yan\u2019s mouth formed a joyful smile. In delight, he slowly stepped off the bed.He took a look back at the bed and realized it had become a mess. Two naked, white bodies were spread upon it, with a satisfied smile on their faces. They were deep asleep.These two women were not warriors and seemed to be unable to bear his mysterious energy. As he ejaculated, that mysterious energy didn\u2019t come out, for it had already been absorbed by Shi Yan.With a little surprise, Shi Yan turned his head back and without hesitation walked over to the mysterious woman slowly.Bright moonlight was coming through the window. It was late at night.Shi Yan stretched out his hand and examined the woman\u2019s back, only to find that she was recovering at an unbelievable speed!At this speed, she would wake up at dawn.Tonight Beiming Shang must be searching for her everywhere, however he would have never believed that she would be in a brothel.After tonight, this unknown woman could recover up to 80 percent, and then she could go to anywhere in Tianyun City.How is Han Feng?Shi Yan suddenly remembered Han Feng. If he escaped from Bloody Hand, he would be looking for Shi Yan everywhere. Once he couldn\u2019t find Shi Yan, he would assume that he was killed by Li Han and Mo Qi.After all, Han Feng didn\u2019t know Shi Yan\u2019s real ability, while Li Han was a Human Realm warrior!Shi Jian regarded Shi Yan as the treasure of the Shi family, therefore, once he knew that Shi Yan was dead, he would do everything he could to get revenge.After a thought, Shi Yan decided to leave quickly and return home.As his hand stroked the woman\u2019s back, it finally came to the cloth that covered her pretty face.Lifting a corner of the cloth, Shi Yan revealed her cherry-like lips. He smiled unexpectedly, went up, and pressed his lips on hers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAn intoxicating fragrance was coming out from that woman\u2019s mouth\u2026In just a short moment of inhaling it, Shi Yan felt rather refreshed and found a comfort he had never experienced before. He couldn\u2019t suppress his desire again.Moving his mouth away unwillingly, Shi Yan raised his head and gazed at her with emotional eyes, and mumbled, \u201cWell, I saved your life, this kiss is my reward.\u201dAfter that, Shi Yan opened the half-closed window and swiftly jumped out.His figure moved in the dark night for a moment, faded into the dim moonlight, and finally disappeared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She looked around the room and finally saw the bed draped in red duvet covers.Xia Xin Yan\u2019s heart shook. She abruptly sat up on the carpet, and looked at the bed in panic.On the bed, the two girls from the Misty Rain House, Yan Yun and Rou, were completely naked. The whole room was filled with a strange scent.Numerous thoughts flashed through Xia Xin Yan\u2019s mind. She hurriedly checked her own body, and realizing she was still untainted, she finally sighed in relief.Her fight with Beiming Shang had injured her quite seriously. When falling into the Moon Lake, she only had the time to take a Nutrition Pill.It was due to the improper distribution of the medicinal powers of the Nutrition Pill that she had suddenly fainted and fell unconscious while walking up onto the bank.Her memories just before she fainted slowly became clear, and she remembered seeing Shi Yan standing at the bank of the lake\u2026That was the last thing she could remember before she fainted.Xia Xin Yan felt something on her face. She reached out to grab it and found the piece of cloth that Shi Yan used to cover her gorgeous face.Looking at the sweaty and stinky rag, Xia Xin Yan furrowed her brows, and she became even more confused.What happened?Xia Xin Yan stood up, gazing at the two sleeping girls on the bed, and groaned. She then pulled out a white handkerchief from her sleeve to cover her face again. Finally, she walked to the door and pushing it open, shouting, \u201cIs there anyone here?\u201d\u201cComing right up!\u201d The voice of the Madam rang out.In a short moment, the Madam, who had previously led Shi Yan into this room, came up smiling.Once she arrived into the room, the Madam nervously peeked at the bed, and suddenly shouted in surprise, \u201cHey, where\u2019s that young master?\u201d\u201cYoung master?\u201d Xia Xin Yan furrowed her brows, and a strange light flashed across her eyes. \u201cWhere is this place? Who brought me here?\u201d\u201cMiss, you don\u2019t remember anything?\u201dThe Madam was dazed, her makeup-caked face was filled with a strange expression. She scanned Xia Xin Yan from head to toe, then suddenly laughed, \u201cMiss, that young master couldn\u2019t have possibly just wiped his ass and left after violating you? Ha, I have no idea who that young master was, you better not give me shit for this.\u201dXia Xin Yan\u2019s expression froze, her slim hand smacked the table in the room.\u201cBoom!\u201dThat solid wooden table was instantly crushed, wooden chips and sawdust spreading everywhere on the floor.The Madam\u2019s face immediately changed, and she almost cried on the spot. With a terrified voice she yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! I didn\u2019t do anything! Miss, please let me go!\u201d\u201cI asked you; what is this place? And who brought me here?\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes were filled with impatience.\u201cSo what happened was\u2026\u201dThe Madam sobbed, and fearfully described the whole process in which the things happened. She kept shaking her head in denial, \u201cMiss, I really had nothing to do with it! Please forgive me!\u201dShe had only thought that Xia Xin Yan was violated by Shi Yan, and worried that under the mask of rage on Xia Xin Yan\u2019s face, something bad would be done to her. So the Madam kept crying and begging.After hearing the Madam, Xia Xin Yan was shocked and her expression was very strange.Who was that person?He took me to the brothel, but totally ignored me and audaciously sought pleasure. He really is the most perverted bastard in the world!Xia Xin Yan had hundred percent faith in her beauty!Growing up, she had seen too many different men who coveted her beauty. She knew exactly how fatally alluring she was to men.That was the reason why she always concealed her face, to prevent unnecessary complications.That person was obviously a very perverted guy, she could see it from the fact that he brought her to a brothel. But this extremely perverted guy only had sex with the two tacky makeup-caked prostitutes and didn\u2019t make a single move on herself?Why?While feeling very confused, Xia Xin Yan also felt a slight bit of rage.I\u2019m not as good as these two prostitutes? Is he fucking blind?\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault! It\u2019s really not my fault!\u201d The Madam continued to beg, she kept yelling, but secretly kept observing Xia Xin Yan\u2019s attitude at the same time. Then she hesitatingly asked, \u201cMiss, what did that kid do to you?\u201dXia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes turned cold as she glared at the Madam.The Madam felt a chill run down her body. She started shivering and didn\u2019t dare to ask anything more.Xia Xin Yan thought for a while, and finding the sky slowly turning bright, jumped off the same window from which Shi Yan had earlier exited.On the street, her figure flashed for a few seconds, then disappeared without a trace.The Madam blankly stared at her disappearing silhouette, and secretly sighed in relief. After quite a while she murmured to herself, \u201cI\u2019ve been the Madam here for this many years, but I\u2019ve never seen a woman with such a beautiful figure. That young master sure had a lot of luck, being able to seek pleasure on such a high-class woman.\u201d\u2014The Shi family, in the Stone Room.Shi Jian was furious as he roared in rage, \u201cFind him! You all have to put in all your strength into finding him! Everyone put the Mo family to the side, you have to find Shi Yan first! Don\u2019t come back if you can\u2019t find Shi Yan!\u201dThe Shi family masters, Shi Tie, Shi Dang, and Han Feng all lowered their heads, their expressions dejected.\u201cMaster, it\u2019s all my fault, I couldn\u2019t protect Young Master Yan.\u201d Han Feng lowered his head, but his eyes looked sinister, \u201cXie Shou\u2019s medicine could only last for two hours, now that it should have worn off, I will bring you Xie Shou\u2019s head.\u201d\u201cXie Shou cannot walk out of Tianyun City alive!\u201dShi Jian\u2019s eyes were blood red, with a murderous look he said, \u201cBut right now we don\u2019t have time to take care of Xie Shou, Shi Yan is the most important issue! Everyone go to that place, and even if you have to dig up the whole Tianyun City, you have find Shi Yan! He has another Martial Spirit so he won\u2019t die that easily. You all have to search for him with all your efforts!\u201d\u201cAnother Martial Spirit?\u201dThe faces of Shi Tie and Shi Dang were full of surprise. At this moment, they finally realized why Shi Jian was so furious.Warriors with twin Martial Spirits were one in ten thousand. Each one of such warriors would all eventually become outstanding figures!This was why Beiming Shang arranged Yin Kui and Jiu Shan to protect Beiming Ce.A family descendant with twin Martial Spirits, if under normal circumstances, would definitely become the future leader of the family. They can bring a family to new heights.If such a figure suddenly died, it would become a painful strike to a family!\u201cBig brother, I will go find him myself!\u201d Shi Tie also realized the seriousness of the situation, his face darkened, and was about to immediately leave the Stone Room.\u201cMaster, Young Master Yan is back.\u201dRight at this moment, Han Zhong appeared out of nowhere and said excitedly, \u201cYoung Master Yan is fine, he\u2019s going to arrive at the Stone Room soon.\u201d\u201cHahaha!\u201dShi Jian laughed into the sky, his expression turned from a thunderstorm to a sunny sky, \u201cI knew that kid would be okay! Look, didn\u2019t he come back in one piece?\u201dShi Tie and the rest were all making weird faces, thinking, Who was it that was drowned in anxiousness, and looking so panicked as if his parents had died or something?\u201cYou killed those two?\u201d Shi Tie was shocked. He looked at Shi Yan with disbelief, and said in surprise, \u201cLi Han was a Human Realm warrior! You were able to kill him?\u201d\u201cI suddenly broke through into the Human Realm during the fight, then everything became easy.\u201d Shi Yan smiled nonchalantly.After hearing that, many Shi family warriors in the room were all stunned, their jaws dropped, and stared at Shi Yan with strange expressions.Shi Jian dazed for a second, then he rushed towards Shi Yan and grabbed his arm. After detecting for a while, he suddenly laughed, \u201cThe Gods have not wronged the Shi family! I knew you little brat was some good stuff! Good good! Seventeen years old and in the Human Realm! The nurturing we gave to you did not go in vain! You will definitely become an outstanding figure of this generation!\u201d\u201cWhat happened to Mo Tuo?\u201d Shi Jian furrowed his brows and asked.\u201cHeavily injured! He went back to the Mo family with his [Blood Escape] skill, but he won\u2019t be able to recover for three years! Now he\u2019s probably hiding in his shell in the Mo family, he wouldn\u2019t dare to leave the Mo family for a while.\u201d Shi Tie sneered, and spoke indignantly, \u201cIf it weren\u2019t for those two guys from the Misty Pavilion stopping their chase, Mo Tuo wouldn\u2019t have been able to escape. Too bad we couldn\u2019t kill Mo Tuo.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good enough. This time Mo Tuo is heavily injured, Mo Zhan and Mo Qi are dead, and many warriors from the Mo family were also killed. From now on, the Mo family will never have what it takes to compete with our family again! Hmph, now is the time for us to take as much spoils from the battle as possible! Father, should we go all out?\u201d Shi Dang said.\u201cPass my command, the masters from all the other surrounding cities, from now on they must immediately attack the strongholds of the Mo family! The ones from Tianyun City should also take action now. Other than the headquarters of the Mo family, you can mercilessly attack all the rest of the places!\u201d Shi Jian roared.\u2014The Zuo family.In the secret room, Chi Xiao\u2019s expression was a bit embarrassed, but his face showed a wry smile.Zuo Xu was sipping his tea, and he was also frustrated. He sighed and said, \u201cWhatever, who could\u2019ve known that girl was a Sky Realm warrior. Now we have to use other methods.\u201d\u201cThat girl\u2019s actual combat ability should be around Disaster Realm, Third Sky. But her Martial Spirit is very strange, it\u2019s like she could borrow power from her past life, and temporarily step into the Sky Realm. It\u2019s very frightening! This Martial Spirit has never appeared before; it looks like the Endless Sea is truly an extraordinary place.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euChi Xiao frowned, and sighed in frustration, \u201cThat girl could instantly raise her power to the Sky Realm, probably no one in Tianyun City could easily take that fragment of the map from her. Although I\u2019m not scared of her, I don\u2019t want our fight to be mutually destructive either. If that were the case, my identity would be revealed, and that old fox Beiming Shang would definitely notice something.\u201d\u201cHopefully the Misty Pavilion doesn\u2019t know that we did this. Or else the situation could get really sticky.\u201d Zuo Xu sighed.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with the Shi family\u2019s side?\u201d Chi Xiao moaned, and then suddenly asked.\u201cI will communicate with Shi Jian about this. Then, after the situation becomes less tense, I will send someone to the Misty Pavilion, and hopefully we\u2019d be able to cooperate. Sigh, that girl could instantly jump to the Sky Realm, so I guess this is all we could do.\u201d\u201cHmm, it\u2019s the only way. I hope that girl won\u2019t hold a grudge against me. Sigh, I really feel a little guilty fighting a little girl.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Seeing that she had returned, they immediately rushed up, asking urgently: \u201cMistress, are you hurt?\u201dShaking her head, Xia Xin Yan answered, \u201cI\u2019m fine, the Yang family\u2019s Nutrition Pill is truly a unique elixir of the Endless Sea, I am alright now.\u201dThe Misty Pavilion covered a large area, and there was around a dozen different towers. Although a few had collapsed this time, it still didn\u2019t affect the normal operations of the Misty Pavilion.Entering into the highest Treasure Tower, Xia Xin Yan went to level nine attic.Kro bent down, and spoke while gritting his teeth, \u201cHow dare that Beiming Shang hurt you! Mistress, what do you want to do with the Beiming family next?\u201d\u201cWe don\u2019t have to take care of the Beiming family right now.\u201dXia Xin Yan looked indifferent, \u201cI came here this time for the treasure map to the Gate of Heaven, the Beiming family isn\u2019t my main motive. Beiming Shang is in the Sky Realm, and I am only in the Disaster Realm. Even if I use my Reincarnation Martial Spirit, I can barely put up a fight against him. After this, if Beiming Shang is sensible enough, he won\u2019t mess with the Misty Pavilion. If not, then once the Shura King Xiao Han Yi gets here, I will make Beiming Shang pay for what he\u2019s done!\u201d\u201cMistress, the Sky Realm warrior that came this time, should\u2026 shouldn\u2019t he be from the Mo family. If the Mo family had a Sky Realm master, they wouldn\u2019t have been bullied by the Shi family.\u201d Kro hesitated, and said weakly.\u201cI know it\u2019s not someone from the Mo family.\u201d Unexpectedly, Xia Xin Yan actually nodded, and agreed to Kro\u2019s judgement.\u201cThen Mistress, why would you attack the Mo family?\u201d Kro asked, his face was full of confusion.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t attack the Mo family, how would we be able to cooperate with the people that actually have the treasure map?\u201d Xia Xin Yan lightly chuckled, \u201cWe had to have a scapegoat, otherwise, if the Misty Pavilion kept silent after such a big event, won\u2019t the others think that the Misty Pavilion is easy to bully?\u201d\u201cSo Mistress, you wanted to distract people\u2019s attention?\u201d Kro\u2019s eyes brightened, and he immediately knew her true motive.\u201cYes, just let everyone keep their eyes on the Mo family, then we can easily work with the other side to secretly explore the Gate of Heaven. When Tianyun City becomes chaotic, we can get things done faster.\u201d Xia Xin Yan nodded, and said indifferently, \u201cThat Sky Realm master that came had a strange Martial Spirit that could form mysterious mists. Although he didn\u2019t really use his Martial Spirit, I was able to glimpse its traits. Do you know any Sky Realm masters with a Martial Spirit like that?\u201d\u201cChi Xiao!\u201dKro didn\u2019t hesitate for a moment, and he immediately answered, \u201cChi Xiao is the Sky Realm master of the Cloud Mountain, and he\u2019s close with the Zuo family. Could it have possibly been the Zuo family that got involved this time? Impossible! Unless that half of the fragment map is actually in the Zuo family\u2019s hands?\u201d\u201cIt has to be.\u201d Xia Xin Yan groaned, then she suddenly said, \u201cThere\u2019s no time to wait, I will make a visit to the Zuo family myself, so that we can get this done as soon as possible, in case any mishaps occur.\u201d\u201cMistress, should I go?\u201d\u201cNo it\u2019s alright, that Chi Xiao knows he can\u2019t take me, the Zuo family won\u2019t cause me any trouble.Xia Xin Yan only stayed for a quarter of an hour. Once she was clear on who was the intruder, she immediately took off alone.\u2014The Zuo family.Zuo Xu and Chi Xiao were still discussing in the secret room.\u201cKnock knock!\u201dThere was suddenly a light knocking sound that came from the walls of the secret room.Zuo Xu froze, he leaned into one of the bamboo tubes on the wall and asked, \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a woman with a bamboo hat that came from the Misty Pavilion, she says she wants to see the head of the family.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s that girl!\u201d Chi Xiao exclaimed.Zuo Xu\u2019s expression shifted. He slowly paced in the secret room, and after a long while, he finally said with a frown, \u201cCould it be that the Misty Pavilion already knows it was us? That can\u2019t be right. If they really knew it was us, why would they attack the Mo family? How strange.\u201d\u201cYou should go out and meet her, I\u2019ll stay here.\u201d Chi Xiao hesitated, then said, \u201cLet\u2019s see what she wants.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u2014In the guest room of the Zuo family, Zuo Xu sat there calmly. He looked at Xia Xin Yan, who was wearing a bamboo hat, and smiled, \u201cHow may I address you, Miss?\u201d\u201cXia Xin Yan.\u201d\u201cWell Miss Xia, may I ask for what reason did you come to our family? I don\u2019t think the Zuo family has had any affairs with the Misty Pavilion lately?\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s Chi Xiao?\u201d Xia Xin Yan shook her head, and casually said.Zuo Xu\u2019s expression slightly changed, but he quickly returned to calmness. He asked in confusion, \u201cMiss Xia, for what reason did you ask? Chi Xiao has always been cultivating in the Cloud Mountain, do you know him?\u201d\u201cOf course. We fought just yesterday, he left quite a deep impression.\u201d Xia Xin Yan sat there naturally, and slowly sipped on her tea.Zuo Xu\u2019s expression kept changing, his smile a little forced, \u201cMiss Xia, could you have been mistaken? The person that attacked the Misty Pavilion yesterday, wasn\u2019t he from the Mo family?\u201d\u201cMaster Zuo, I didn\u2019t come here today to settle the accounts with you.\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes were a little impatient, \u201cOn the contrary, I came to sincerely ask you to cooperate.\u201dThen, Xia Xin Yan pulled out other half of the dark yellow treasure map, and directly placed it on the table between her and Zuo Xu. She spoke lightly, \u201cHalf of the treasure map is right here. Head of the Zuo family, if you\u2019re straightforward enough, then let\u2019s just cut to the chase. We can immediately combine the two pieces of the map and once we know where the Gate of Heaven is at, we can start moving immediately. Master Zuo, don\u2019t waste everyone\u2019s time! Right now, everyone has their eyes on the Mo family. We can take the opportunity to explore the Gate of Heaven. How\u2019s that, Master Zuo?\u201dXia Xin Yan was a little aggressive, she didn\u2019t give a damn about the head of the family, Zuo Xu. Her motives were clear; she came for the other half of the treasure map!Zuo Xu was a little unsure as to what Xia Xin Yan\u2019s motives were. He didn\u2019t know if she really wanted to cooperate, or if she was just trying to feel them out using her words, so that she could take steps to go against the Zuo family.But since Xia Xin Yan had the capability of a Sky Realm warrior, Zuo Xu couldn\u2019t casually speak out. His mind flashed, racing in thought.\u201cMaster Zuo, I don\u2019t like to linger on things, and I also don\u2019t like putting in personal affairs when dealing with business. Chi Xiao was sensible enough, he knew when to retreat after realizing that I was in the Sky Realm. None of us got hurt, so there\u2019s no grudges in this. I came only for the treasure map! I have no intention to cause trouble! Is that clear?\u201dXia Xin Yan\u2019s pretty brows furrowed, she stared at Zuo Xu coldly, and became more and more impatient.Zuo Xu\u2019s expression continuously changed as he thought for a long moment. He faintly had the idea that Xia Xin Yan didn\u2019t come to interrogate them. Groaning, he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cThe other half of the map is not in my hands.\u201d\u201cThen whose hands is it in?\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes brightened.\u201cIt\u2019s on Shi Jian.\u201d\u201cThen I have nothing to discuss with you, I will go find Shi Jian.\u201d Xia Xin Yan took the half piece of the map from the table. She stood up and said, \u201cMaster Zuo, sorry to bother you, I will be leaving now.\u201d\u201cI will go with you!\u201dZuo Xu immediately stood up, thinking, \u201cSuch a materialistic girl. Changing your attitude right after hearing I don\u2019t have the map. You sure are the owner of the Misty Pavilion, a typical city merchant!\u201d\u201cDoes it still have anything to do with you?\u201d Xia Xin Yan was surprised.Zuo Xu\u2019s expression was starting to darken, he snorted, then said, \u201cShi Jian and I are in this together! Our family has a part in exploring the Gate of Heaven too. Don\u2019t you think it still has something to do with me?\u201d\u201cOh, then we can go together.\u201d Xia Xin Yan said casually.\u201cWait up, let me call someone else along.\u201d Zuo Xu forced a smile at Zuo Shi, and said awkwardly, \u201cChi Xiao\u2019s going too, uh, you said you didn\u2019t mind, right?\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mind. With Chi Xiao coming along, it will be safer.\u201d\u2014The Shi family, on the third level of Shi Yan\u2019s personal stone tower.Shi Yan sat on the floor with crossed legs. His expression was serious, he held in his breath and concentrated, he was able to clearly feel the natural energies scattered in the air.Calming his mind, Shi Yan shut his eyes tightly and started circulating the Profound Qi in his body.After seven continuous cycles of circulation, the expression on his face suddenly froze!In his body, rich concentrated Profound Qi flowed down his left arm like a river rushing towards its banks.Like wild horses on the loose, the Profound Qi fiercely surged into his left arm. His left arm shook lightly, and traces of sweat dripped down his face.\u201cRoar!\u201dShi Yan suddenly shouted out.

He was thousands of miles tall and seemed to have been standing there for thousands of billions of years.An ancient aura suddenly exploded out from this extremely huge giant!Immediately, countless bright flames exploded from the meridians all over his body!His meridians were like numerous stars in the sky that moved in their own orbits. Every single meridian possessed the power to ruin the world, and every meridian was a small world itself, from which came the cries of all sorts of creatures.In that boundless space, there were piles and piles of bones and the ground had turned crimson due to all the blood.Some piles of bones were as high as a mountain; no one knew where they came from.Looking at the piles of bones, many of them were of some-odd-looking creatures. Some looked to be having three heads and six arms, some looked like a divine dragon, some had three sockets for eyes, some looked like marine animals, and so forth\u2026They were all prostrated on the ground, as if bowing towards that giant, worshipping it as if it was the sole true God!All of a sudden, a peculiar light flashed across the hideous ancient god\u2019s pupils.His right pupil was shining brightly as the sun, as if bringing every creature light and life, giving this world hope.On the contrary, his left pupil was as dark as a black hole, containing endless darkness which symbolized negative actions like maiming, killing, death, insanity and hatred.From his left pupil, one could see the darkest side of humanity.One eye looked alive while the other looked deadly. Standing between the sky and the earth, that ancient god seemed to be waiting for something.All of a sudden, that pair of eyes noticed Shi Yan.A mysterious power immediately reached Shi Yan\u2019s mind and connected the two of them together.In that strange space, came the abrupt and terrifying howls of the ancient god.Numerous odd light symbols flew out from his eyes, and invaded into Shi Yan\u2019s spiritual body, making every one of his meridians shine as bright as a star.Severe pain exploded in each of his meridians, and as Shi Yan\u2019s head received a splitting pain, he suddenly woke up.He was still on the third floor of the stone house, the Blood Vein Ring was on the ring finger of his left hand, and the odd red light was slowly becoming dimmer. He sat there with a numb head.If someone came at that time, he would find that deep in his pupils, there were odd light spots which looked like small symbols dancing.\u2014Xia Xin Yan, Chi Xiao and Zuo Xu were walking together in the backyard of the Shi family.The three were astonished at the same time, as they looked at the stone building five hundred meters away with a shocked expression on their faces.\u201cThere is some peculiar energy is rippling over there, which seems very old and coming from the times of great antiquity.\u201d Xia Xin Yan said softly and her eyes behind her veil were full of surprise, \u201cThis ancient energy, should\u2026 should not exist here right now.\u201dChi Xiao also looked weird as he stared at that stone building with extreme focus, \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but I feel that my Martial Spirit was slightly triggered by that energy. Weird, it\u2019s really weird! What kind of energy is able to resonate with Martial Spirits?\u201dXia Xin Yan shook her head, thought for a while and asked, \u201cZuo Family Head, Shi Jian lives in that stone building, right? Well, it seems I have underestimated him. He is unbelievable\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, absolutely no!\u201d Zuo Xu couldn\u2019t help but shake his head, and said in a weird tone, \u201cThat stone building is now used by Shi Jian\u2019s grandson, Shi Yan. He likes studying ancient relics. He is a\u2026 rather extraordinary kid.\u201d\u201cShi Yan\u2026\u201d Xia Xin Yan repeated that name in her mind secretly with some astonishment crossing her eyes, and she nodded, \u201cLet\u2019s visit the family head.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u2014Inside the secret room, Shi Jian and Shi Tie, who were busy discussing how to deal with the Mo family, noticed the strange energy fluctuations.Shi Jian\u2019s face changed slightly, as he shouted in astonishment, \u201cThat strange energy came from Shi Yan\u2019s building!\u201dThe stir from Shi Yan\u2019s stone building was sensed by all the warriors who were at high realms.After a terrifying cry, Shi Jian pushed open the stone door of the secret room and rushed out.Shi Tie chased behind him in a hurry.They exited the secret room and dashed directly towards Shi Yan\u2019s stone building.However, before they got to Shi Yan\u2019s stone building, they saw Zuo Xu, Chi Xiao and Xia Xin Yan.Shi Jian was a little astonished as his expression was rather unusual. He paused for a bit and asked from afar, \u201cBrother Zuo, why so early?\u201dHe recognized Xia Xin Yan at once and was a little nervous. Like Zuo Xu, he had a guilty conscience, guessing Xia Xin Yan came to make a punitive expedition against him.\u201cBrother, let\u2019s find a quiet place and have a talk.\u201dZuo Xu smiled bitterly, and pointed at Xia Xin Yan to introduce, \u201cThis is the hidden master of the Misty Pavilion, Miss Xia Xin Yan. She has something important to discuss with you.\u201dShi Jian was a little surprised. After a short hesitation, he gave up the idea of visiting Shi Yan in his stone house and nodded, \u201cFollow me.\u201dBefore long, Shi Jian and Shi Tie showed the three guests to the Rock Room.Having seated himself in the Rock Room, Zuo Xu coughed, and spilled Xia Xin Yan\u2019s intention.\u201cCooperation?\u201dShi Jian got relieved. After a short thought, he nodded with a smile, \u201cThat is most welcome. The position of the Gate of Heaven would only be shown by a complete map, and we, the Shi family, never intended to take everything. Miss Xia, you are so generous! A great woman!\u201dXin Yan was straightforward as she took out the half map out and spread it on the stone ground, then said softly, \u201cShi Family Head, take out your half.\u201dShi Jian looked to Zuo Xu. After Zuo Xu nodded, he took out the other half of the map and put it on the ground to match the first half.A bunch of yellow lights suddenly blazed at the joining of the two halves.That yellow light seemed to have some stickiness, as it connected the two halves into a perfectly complete map.The bright yellow light glowed from the complete treasure map.On that yellow map, lines were twisting and changing like living earthworms, the pattern on it shifting completely.It slowly became clear. Soon, there formed a vivid image of a valley.Strange Yin Qi covered that valley, out of which, there were numerous green swamps, even the bubbles in them could be seen clearly.Shi Jian, Shi Tie, Zuo Xu and Chi Xiao were all taken by surprise.Only Xia Xin Yan looked calm, as she said naturally, \u201cFriends, I\u2019m not familiar with this area. Although the map is clear, I don\u2019t know which place is which. Do you have any idea?\u201d\u201cThe Dead Swamp! Yin Valley!\u201dChi Xiao\u2019s expression changed quickly. After a long while, he announced firmly, \u201cThat\u2019s it! It is absolutely Yin Valley, which is the most mysterious part of the Dead Swamp, where the Yin Qi is most dense and many Yin treasures are produced.\u201d\u201cGood, if you are sure about it.\u201d Xia Xin Yan nodded, \u201cIf it\u2019s certain, we can begin to prepare to travel to Yin Valley. It should not be delayed. I will arrange it back in the Misty Pavilion and set off soon.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t the Yin Valley home to Nine-headed Sky Snake?\u201d Zuo Xu took a deep breath and asked Chi Xiao beside him.Shi Jian\u2019s expression changed.Chi Xiao nodded slowly, \u201cYes. The Nine-headed Sky Snake lives in the Yin Valley. It seems that this journey won\u2019t go peacefully.\u201d\u201cNine-headed Sky Snake?\u201d Xia Xin Yan was quite calm, \u201cBy the sounds of it, is it a high realm demon beast?\u201d\u201cA Level 7 demon beast!\u201d Chi Xiao said.Xia Xin Yan furrowed her brows and nodded, \u201cWell it might be tough. But anyway, a Level 7 demon beast equals a Sky Realm warrior. We can beat it together.\u201d\u201cThe Nine-headed Sky Snake is a Level 7 demon beast. But it is the most powerful one among all Level 7 demon beasts. It has nine heads which can all think separately, and it is very aggressive. I\u2019d rather fight with three normal Level 7 demon beasts than him. Hmm, I will go back to the Cloudy Mountain first and get some weapons in case something unusual happens.\u201d Chi Xiao sighed.\u201cKeep the treasure map with you. Let\u2019s meet at the entrance of the Dead Swamp in a month.\u201dXia Xin Yan was quite decisive as she stood up and said calmly, \u201cI hope you will be on time. I don\u2019t have so much time to waste.\u201d Then, Xia Xin Yan walked out with light steps.Brother, what to do now?\u201d Zuo Xu smiled bitterly, \u201cTianyun City is now in total chaos, plus the Shi and Mo families are going through a crucial phase. Will you still take some time to handle this?\u201d\u201cHardly.\u201dShi Jian shook his head and thought for a while, \u201cSince Chi Xiao is going there, my presence is not that important, I will send some other guy. Mmm, Shi Yan likes goofing around, would you like him to go with you?\u201dShi Jian stared at Chi Xiao.Chi Xiao nodded softly.\u201cI can\u2019t leave Tianyun City right now, or Beiming Shang would suspect me. I will send Shi Yan with you and two other warriors. We have to keep it a secret. Don\u2019t let too many people get involved.\u201dZuo Xu deliberated for a while and agreed with Shi Jian.\u201cShi Family Head, I need to go back to Cloudy Mountain first. I will get to the Dead Swamp in a month\u2019s time. Your people don\u2019t need to go with me for now. Let them go with Shi Yan to the Dead Swamp. I can go there faster alone.\u201d Chi Xiao said.\u201cOk, I will send Han Feng to follow that bastard Shi Yan and Zuo Shi when they leave Tianyun City secretly. One month, hmm, that would be fine.\u201d Shi Jian nodded and handed that treasure map to Chi Xiao and said earnestly, \u201cChi Xiao, please do me a favor to take care of Shi Yan. I want him to be safe.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cNo worries.\u201d Chi Xiao didn\u2019t refuse, and put that treasure map away naturally.\u2014On the third floor of that stone building.The Blood Vein Ring on his ring finger had returned to normal, but Shi Yan was still sitting in a trance; a sudden glimmer flashed through his eyes.A long time later, Shi Yan gradually came back to himself and his eyes sparkled. He lowered his head and mumbled, \u201cInheritance of the War Devil: [Seal of Life and Death]! The Martial Skill that operates my mysterious Martial Spirit! Too magical!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 79 \u2013 The Seal of Life and DeathIn the stone tower.Shi Yan\u2019s expression was full of surprise. His mind clicked, and he continued to violently pour all of his Profound Qi into the Blood Vein Ring. However, a short time later he encountered a new barrier in the Ring.He was out of sorts for a second, and finally came to the conclusion that the Blood Vein Ring was definitely a strange treasure. Inside were layers and layers of barriers, and behind every single barrier was new things to be found.The first time he pounded at the Blood Vein Ring, he obtained the cultivation method for [Rampage]. This time, he got the [Seal of Life and Death]. The Blood Vein Ring was like a patient mentor, who will set a barrier at every special stage, and you could only peek into its secrets if you can break that barrier.The complex ancient [Seal of Life and Death] was clearly imprinted deep in his mind. Just like the skill [Rampage], once he focused on the [Seal of Life and Death], the mnemonics would appear in his mind.Shi Yan couldn\u2019t immediately and completely understand the mnemonics of the [Seal of Life and Death]. But just from a glance, he could understood that the [Seal of Life and Death] was an extraordinary Martial Skill that could utilize his mysterious Martial Spirit!Using the circulation method of the [Seal of Life and Death], he was able to stir the negative energy in all of his meridians. Those negative energies would flow towards his left arm in a special pattern, forming a [Death Seal] with extremely negative characteristics.The [Seal of Life and Death] also had secret methods to stir the Profound Qi in the whole body, making it flow into the right arm, and form another extraordinary thing called the [Life Seal].The left hand is the [Death Seal] and the right hand is the [Life Seal]. When using this skill in battle, the two seals can be merged into one, forming the true [Seal of Life and Death].The power of the [Seal of Life and Death] depended on the density of the negative energies in the body and the amount of Profound Qi. Its strongest power would be released when forming a total of forty-nine seals.Seven seals would be marked as the first sky. As the realm and martial skill of a warrior progressed, the number of seals forming would increase when using [Seal of Life and Death].Every time one broke through to another sky, the number and size of the seals formed would multiply.According to the mnemonics of the [Seal of Life and Death], once you reaching the seventh sky, forty-nine seals would instantly form and release an earth-crushing power.And if these forty-nine seals were fused together, it would emit an invincible strength, easily able to crush the highest mountains!However, the mnemonics on the [Seal of Life and Death] were quite hard to understand, and would take a while to completely digest.Before he could completely figure out the deep meanings of the ancient texts, Shi Yan didn\u2019t dare to rashly cultivate the [Seal of Life and Death].He knew from learning [Rampage] that any secret Martial Skills coming from the Blood Vein Ring weren\u2019t to be underestimated.After thinking for a while, Shi Yan decided to spend his time trying to understand the mnemonics about the Seal.Shi Yan slowly stood up. He furrowed his brows and moved to the window, gazing across at the Shi family\u2019s artificial lake.A beautiful figure suddenly appeared into his view.A strange light flashed in Shi Yan\u2019s eyes. There was a surprise on his face, and he murmured quietly, \u201cWhy has she come to the Shi family?\u201dFar away by the lake, Xia Xin Yan was wearing a veil on her face, looking every bit the peerless beauty. She was being led by Han Feng to the back door of the secret room of the Shi family.Shi Yan had a strong impression of Xia Xin Yan, the mysterious woman. Just by gazing from far away, he immediately recognized her, and secretly he was surprised.Lead by Han Feng, Xia Xin Yan quickly went into the garden behind the lake, and disappeared into the secret room.Soon, Chi Xiao and Zuo Xu also quietly followed, and disappeared through the same door into the Shi family\u2019s secret room.After a while, Shi Jian finally walked out of the Stone Room. His eyes swept to the Shi Yan\u2019s stone tower, and immediately started walking towards it.Shi Yan\u2019s mind flicked. He silently closed the windows, and quietly sat down on the third floor of the stone tower, as if he had been deeply immersed in cultivating.\u201cKid, what was that just a moment ago?\u201d Shi Jian quickly appeared on the third floor of Shi Yan\u2019s tower. As soon as he came in, he immediately glared at Shi Yan and asked.\u201cWhat was what?\u201d Shi Jian opened his eyes, looking confused.\u201cHalf an hour ago, there was a strange fluctuation coming from this place. Did you make that happen? You little brat better explain to me.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, I was just quietly cultivating. You know, I just reached the Human Realm, and I\u2019m still trying to get familiar with the circulation pattern of the natural energies. Maybe I just accidentally tuned into the natural patterns, and caused a resonance of the natural energies.\u201d Shi Yan smiled, full of bullshit.Shi Jian furrowed his brows, stared at Shi Yan for a second, then finally sneered, \u201cYou little brat, hiding a bunch of secrets huh, hmph. I couldn\u2019t care less! Just don\u2019t act too recklessly and screw yourself over.\u201dAs the head of the family, Shi Jian could immediately see he wasn\u2019t speaking the truth. But Shi Jian didn\u2019t want to intervene on everything. Seeing that Shi Yan was fine, Shi Jian just allowed him to keep bullshitting.After pondering for a second, Shi Jian told him about the issue that Xia Xin Yan, Zuo Xu, and Chi Xiao came to talk about. Then he finally said, \u201cThis time, I am going to let you, Han Feng, and Ku Long go together. We are only investigating the location of the Gate of Heaven this time, to get to understand the situation. You only need to follow along and get some experience. Remember, don\u2019t act rashly! If anything happens just let Chi Xiao and that Xia girl handle it. These two both have the Sky Realm combat abilities, even if they can\u2019t take on the Nine-headed Sky Snake, they could at least keep you guys safe.\u201dShi Yan was surprised. He didn\u2019t expect Xia Xin Yan to be so generous. Not only did she not blame Chi Xiao for the sneak attack, she also stepped on the Mo family in order to divert everyone\u2019s attention. In the end, she forgave what had happened and took the initiative to lend her hand.This woman was something!Shi Yan\u2019s eyes glimmered, secretly surprised. He frowned, thought for a moment, and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I also care about my life a lot, I don\u2019t want to lose it. My role is just to fill up a spot in the exploration of Gate of Heaven, I won\u2019t put my life on the line for this.\u201dOkay, prepare yourself. Tonight at midnight, you, Han Feng, and Ku Long will secretly set off, and meet up with Zuo Shi at the north entrance of Tianyun City. Remember, you have to be careful! The Gate of Heaven is important, but you are more important to the Shi family, you have to come back safely!\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u2014The Beiming family.Beiming Shang sat at the seventh level of the Ice Pavilion, his body overflowing with freezing energy, there was even a layer of frost covering his body. Just looking at him, Beiming Shang looked like an ice sculpture, appearing very strange.Beiming Ce, Yin Kui, and Jiu Shan were standing aside, their expressions serious.Other than them, there was also Beiming Ce\u2019s father, Beiming Qie.Beiming Qie was at Earth Realm, Third Sky. He always took care of affairs outside of Tianyun City, but after hearing about the chaos happening in Tianyun City, he rushed here from Beiluo City overnight.After Beiming Shang fought with Xia Xin Yan, he immediately entered the Ice Pavilion, and hadn\u2019t come out since.The masters in the Beiming family were worried about Beiming Shang. They strictly guarded the Ice Pavilion, and had been on the look-out from day to night, afraid that mishaps might happen in this crucial moment.After a very long time, the frost on Beiming Shang\u2019s body gradually seeped into his body.\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cGrandpa!\u201dBeiming Qie and Beiming Ce both called out.Beiming Shang slowly opened his eyes, and breathed out a cloud of white frost. He said, \u201cThat girl\u2019s Martial Spirit is strange, she could actually use her power from her last life and instantly step into the Sky Realm. The Endless Sea is truly a holy place for thousands of warriors. And only from that place could such a frightening Martial Spirit exist.\u201d\u201cFather, are you alright?\u201d Beiming Qie asked worriedly.Shaking his head, Beiming Shang said, \u201cDid you find that girl?\u201d\u201cShe mysteriously disappeared last night. We searched all night, but couldn\u2019t find any trace of her.\u201dBeiming Qie was slightly nervous, he hesitated, and then said, \u201cBut early this morning, she returned to the Misty Pavilion. Our spies say that she only stayed in the Misty Pavilion for a short moment, then she left alone. We don\u2019t know where she went.\u201d\u201cLast night her injuries were worse than mine. We couldn\u2019t find her last night, and now we have missed the best chance.\u201d Beiming Shang sighed, then said, \u201cShe dared to appear this morning, that means her injuries have almost recovered. We don\u2019t have a chance to take her anymore. Pass on my orders, don\u2019t move on the Misty Pavilion.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d Beiming Qie nodded, but he also felt a little regretful, \u201cTianyun City is full of our spies, I wonder where the hell she hid last night. If we could\u2019ve found her, then we could\u2019ve killed her.\u201d\u201cWe missed our chance so we can\u2019t do anything about it, not everything\u2019s going to go our way.\u201d Beiming Shang got over the matter, he pondered, and then said, \u201cKeep an eye on all four city gates! Release all the Cloud Eagles in the family, if any major figures of the other four families are getting in or out of the city, inform me immediately!\u201d\u201cFather, you\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cDing Yan is definitely dead! Someone must have gotten that half of the fragmented map, or else there\u2019s no reason why someone cannot wait to seize that other half of the fragmented map from the Misty Pavilion.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBeiming Shang sneered, and said, \u201cThe Mo family lost miserably this time. If they had a Sky Realm master to back them up, with Mo Tuo\u2019s temperament, he wouldn\u2019t have just let this slide! We only need to wait two days, if the Mo family doesn\u2019t make any major actions in two days, we can eliminate them from the possibilities.\u201d\u201cWho could it be?\u201d\u201cWhichever family couldn\u2019t hold it in anymore, and leaves the city first.\u201dBeiming Shang scowled, and said, \u201cThat girl left the Misty Pavilion early in the morning, she definitely must have figured out something. Maybe the two map pieces have already been put together by now. Keep an eye on the Misty Pavilion too, we can ignore the fight between the Mo and Shi families for now. Spread out all our spies, in three days, if any direct descendants of the three families leave the city, I need to receive the news immediately!\u201d\u201cUnderstood!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

An old man was standing beside the carriage and staring at the starry sky in a daze.Whisperings could be heard from the carriage.The carriage was surrounded by many high and low tombs, and the green wildfire beside them was giving out a very gloomy atmosphere in the dark night.\u201cIt\u2019s the Zuo Family\u2019s.\u201d Ku Long got to one unmarked burial-mounds and remarked after taking a glimpse from afar.Shi Yan nodded and said indifferently, \u201cIt seems we are late anyway.\u201dThe old man overheard their talk, and as he withdrew his eyes and looked in their direction, he raised the whip in his hand.Receiving his signal, the three including Shi Yan walked over.\u201cMiss, people from the Shi family have arrived.\u201d The old man reported to that carriage at a cautious low voice.\u201cAbout time they got here.\u201d Zuo Shi\u2019s voice came from the carriage.An elegant and graceful woman came out of the carriage quietly, glanced at Shi Yan, and said to Zuo Shi with a big smile, \u201cThat kid is here.\u201d\u201cAunt Lian!\u201d Zuo Shi cried with a sweet girlish and angry voice, \u201cI told you, there is nothing between us! Please stop teasing me!\u201d\u201cHehe, okay, okay.\u201d That woman giggled, and waved at Shi Yan standing beside the carriage. As Shi Yan came near, she said, \u201cYoung Master Yan, you three didn\u2019t take a carriage?\u201d\u201cIt will be arranged for us when we get to the Xuelai City in the North.\u201d Shi Yan looked indifferent. He took a glimpse at the woman and complimented her secretly, then walked to the carriage at a leisurely pace and put a huge package into it, \u201cXiao Shi, this is your Dragon Turtle Armor. My grandpa asked me to return it to you.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Zuo Shi replied and whispered, \u201cYou ungrateful guy! You wasted our good will!\u201dShi Yan withdrew his smile, \u201cYou had told me that whoever uses the Dragon Turtle Armor is a turtle. I don\u2019t want to be a turtle.\u201d\u201cHaha!\u201dSitting in the carriage, Zuo Shi couldn\u2019t help but giggle, \u201cYou guys have really good memory huh? I had said that to infuriate my grandpa so that you could take the Armor. You helped me unlock the shell and get me the treasure, of course you deserve the Dragon Turtle Armor.\u201d\u201cThe Martial Spirit of Shi family is more than enough for defending. I don\u2019t need that Armor.\u201d Shi Yan shook his head.\u201cMiss, shall we go now?\u201d The warrior from the Zuo Family got on the carriage, waved his whip and asked softly.\u201cYes, let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWait. Please let me introduce first. This is Chu Ping, First Sky of the Nirvana Realm. I\u2019m Wu Yunlian.\u201d That graceful woman elegantly smiled and said to Han Feng, \u201cI know Brother Han, and this is?\u201d She looked to Ku Long.\u201cKu Long, First Sky of the Nirvana Realm.\u201d Ku Long introduced himself in a friendly manner as he scratched his head, \u201cI have been staying out of the town and just came back for the Martial Competition. Ha, we haven\u2019t have a chance to meet.\u201d\u201cSo you are Brother Ku Long!\u201d Wu Yunlian beamed and nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s an honor for me to work with Brother Han and Brother Ku Long! Hope we can get to know each other well!\u201d\u201cYou are too modest.\u201d Han Feng and Ku Long said together.This woman looked dignified, and was at the First Sky of the Nirvana Realm. She was a warrior from the Cloud Mountain.Since she was once helped by Chi Xiao, she attached herself to the Zuo family at Chi Xiao\u2019s introduction, and was rather cared for by Zuo Xu and became an intimate friend to Zuo Shi.Han Feng and Ku Long knew she was someone of status, so they were both polite to her.\u201cThen let\u2019s start our journey.\u201d Shi Yan looked up at the sky but suddenly furrowed his brows as he pointed at a dark spot in the sky, \u201cMmm, what\u2019s that?\u201dChu Ping, Han Feng, Ku Long and Wu Yunlian raised their heads together.\u201cA Cloud Eagle!\u201dHan Feng\u2019s expression changed as he yelled, \u201cIt\u2019s the Beiming Family\u2019s!

He gazed at the departing eagle and said, \u201cMaybe it\u2019s on the way back the Beiming family from somewhere else, and happened to be here. It may not be trailing us specially.\u201d\u201cWe have to be cautious anyway.\u201d Wu Yunlian sighed softly, \u201cWe need to be quick. Even if the Beiming Family is shadowing us, they can\u2019t find us easily if we are cautious enough.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d\u2014Later that night, in the Ice Room of the Beiming family.\u201cFather, news came that people from the Shi and Zuo families secretly left from the North Gate. The Shi family have sent Han Feng, Ku Long and Shi Yan, and the Zuo family have sent Chu Ping, Wu Yunlian and one other in a carriage. It must be Miss Zuo Shi.\u201dBeiming Qi hurried back to the Ice Room, and told the latest news after a bow.Beiming Ce was in the Ice Room too. He was training with the aid of the freezing air in the Ice Room. Hearing upon the news, he opened his eyes and cried out, \u201cIt is the Shi family and the Zuo family!\u201dBeiming Shang looked gloomy as he sat there still, with cold air diffusing in his eyes.After a long time, Beiming Shang said, \u201cThe other half of the treasure map must be in their hands. It must be Chi Xiao who grabbed the map from the Misty Pavilion. That girl in the Misty Pavilion is too wicked and she used Mo Tuo to distract us. We would have been cheated if we weren\u2019t cautious enough to let the Cloud Eagle shadow them.\u201d\u201cFather, what should we do now?\u201d\u201cI will go after them with Ce, to see where they are heading for?\u201d\u201cCe is going too?\u201d\u201cIt is not peaceful in the Tianyun City recently. I will take Yin Kui and Jiu Shan with me this time. It\u2019s not safe to leave Ce alone in the town.\u201d Beiming Shang ordered, \u201cYou stay at home, and tell people that I\u2019m cultivating in seclusion. Don\u2019t stir any suspicion.\u201d\u201cGot it.\u201d\u201cGrandpa, the Zuo and Shi families must have come to a certain agreement with the Misty Pavilion. If Chi Xiao allied with that woman, will you be in danger when in a battle with them?\u201dBeiming Ce took a breath and said indifferently, \u201cI\u2019ve made some preparations.\u201dHis eyes sparkled.\u201cThe Dark Master from the Dark World sent a message days ago that he wants Mu Yu Die. I haven\u2019t replied yet.\u201d Beiming Shang thought for a while, and looked at Beiming Ce, \u201cHe is at the Sky Realm, it would be fine with his help. Chi Xiao and that girl can hardly compete with us. They could only choose to cooperate with us to explore the Gate of Heaven.\u201d\u201cThe Dark Master from the Dark World!\u201dBeiming Ce was shocked, but also sad. He whispered after a long while, \u201cGrandpa, what on earth do you mean?\u201d\u201cMu Yu Die\u2019s Martial Spirit is great, but it\u2019s useless for us. Rather, that Di Yalan may be able to combine with our Ice Martial Spirit.\u201d Staring at him, Beiming Shang shouted, \u201cMerely a woman! You can\u2019t even let it go?\u201dBeiming Ce frowned and shook his head, \u201cNo. It\u2019s just\u2026 just too unexpected. I will give up anything for the Beiming Family.\u201d\u201cGood. You are going to take over the whole family. Don\u2019t be so emotional.\u201d Beiming Shang nodded with satisfaction and comforted, \u201cDon\u2019t worry child. That Dark Master only wants to use that girl to train his Martial Spirit. He won\u2019t care if she is a virgin or not. I will let you two be together for three days before I hand her to the Dark Master.\u201d\u201cThank you Grandpa!\u201d Beiming Ce beamed.\u201cFor this time, take Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan with you. Later, I will hand Mu Yu Die over to the Dark Master without letting Di Yalan know.\u201d Beiming Shang said.\u201cGrandson understands.\u201d\u2014Beiming Ce walked out of the Ice Room. Irrespective of the deep night and he headed for the island in the lake directly.Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan weren\u2019t asleep, but kept training quietly.Seeing that Beiming Ce had arrived, the two girls dressed to welcome him.Beiming Ce beamed, \u201cGet prepared, we need to be out of town before dawn.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d Mu Yu Die was surprised.\u201cThe map to the Gate of Heaven is now complete. Someone has already set off for the exploration, so we are to follow them secretly.\u201d Beiming Ce said earnestly to Mu Yu Die, \u201cXiao Die, there are many treasures in the Gate of Heaven, and my grandpa thinks you and Di Yalan should try your luck. Maybe you will harvest a lot from it. It\u2019s a once-in-a-hundred-year chance. Don\u2019t miss it!\u201dMu Yu Die and Di Yalan\u2019s eyes lit up at the same moment.\u201cMany thanks, Young Master Ce.\u201d Mu Yu Die bowed, with dimple smile on her pretty small face, \u201cI won\u2019t forget your favor if I harvest something from the Gate of Heaven!\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?!\u201d Beiming Ce pretended to be angry, \u201cDo we need that?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry. I will go get prepared.\u201d Mu Yu Die said with a big smile.\u201cOkay. I will wait for you outside. Be quick. Remember, don\u2019t expose yourselves. Let\u2019s go quietly.\u201d Beiming Ce reminded and left the lake with a satisfied smile.\u201cXiao Die, it came to me suddenly that\u2026\u201d Di Yalan\u2019s face dimmed, \u201cThe treasure map is complete, which means Ding Yan was found by them. According to their way of acting, I\u2019m afraid he was already\u2026\u201dUpon hearing that, Mu Yu Die realized it as well. Her expression changed with sorrow.However, she was very relieved when she came to the thought that she may get lots of treasure in the Gate of Heaven.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDon\u2019t worry, he will be fine. They only wanted the map, not his life. Sister Lan, we have to grab this opportunity! Maybe we can get a good fortune from it and our revenge!\u201d Mu Yu Die said ambitiously, clenching her fists.\u201cSigh, I hope he is fine.\u201d Di Yalan sighed with profound resignation.\u201cStop thinking about him. We have to have a good plan to take the most advantage from it!\u201d Mu Yu Die was quite excited.She already pictured the Dark World smashed by her in the near future, as her enemies fallen, covered in blood.She was rather very satisfied every time she came up with that scene; she was totally intoxicated by hatred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Between the Dead Swamp and Xuelai City was a forest of medium sized trees, through which a narrow path had been cleared for use by mercenaries and traders.On the carriage in front, Chu Ping was waving his whip in a relaxed manner.Zhu Shi and Wu Yunlian\u2019s soft giggles could be heard from the carriage every now and then. They seemed to be happily chatting all the way.In the carriage behind them, Han Feng and Ku Long were sitting outside, occasionally uttering some words.Most of the time, they were both on alert and kept an eye on the surroundings.Shi Yan was completely silent in his carriage.For the past dozens of days, apart from meals, Shi Yan hardly got out of the carriage.Every time he got out of the carriage, he wore a tired face with furrowed brows, seeming to be bothered about something.\u2014Late at night.The two carriages had stopped beside a brook in the forest. Zuo Shi and Wu Yunlian got off the carriage and walked to the brook, using the water to rinse their faces.Before long, the two came back with some water to find that it was completely silent inside the other carriage.\u201cWhat is that guy doing?\u201dWu Yunlian looked at the carriage in confusion, her expression clearly showing bewilderment, \u201cI have hardly seen him get of the carriage. Apart from those times when he got down and wolfed down his food, he has been staying in the carriage all day. And every time he comes out, he is always deep in thought, showing such a miserable face. What a weird kid.\u201d\u201cHe has always been a weirdo.\u201d Zuo Shi nodded in acknowledgment, \u201cHe has such strange hobbies like studying historic relics and ancient languages. No one knows what happens in his brain.\u201dWu Yunlian laughed alluringly, \u201cXiao Shi, this guy is really different. Usually such boys would chase you around all day long, and wouldn\u2019t go away even when you tried to drive them off. But this one has never looked at you in these ten days! He seems unwilling to come out of the carriage. Really strange.\u201d\u201cLeave him alone. He is a weirdo.\u201d Zuo Shi was really surprised by Wu Yunlian\u2019s opinion, and realized she was right. Shi Yan had never looked at her while they were on the road.Though not a self-centered girl, Zuo Shi knew that she was pretty, and the attitude Shi Yan showed towards her was very different from other boys\u2019 attitudes.Shi Yan was at his romantic age, but why was he so indifferent towards women?Every woman cared about such things, including Zuo Shi. Apart from some confusion, she was also a little angry.\u201cGet me some water.\u201d Shi Yan\u2019s indifferent voice came from the carriage.Ku Long was stunned as he looked to Han Feng and replied, \u201cFeng, do you still have some water?\u201dHan Feng shook his head, and pointed at Wu Yunlian and Zuo Shi, who were slowly approaching them, \u201cThey get the water these days.\u201dKu Long stuck out his head and looked at Wu Yunlian with a big smile, \u201cSister, please give me some water, my Young Master is thirsty.\u201d\u201cTell him to come get it by himself.\u201d Zuo Shi pouted and grunted, \u201cStaying in the carriage all day. He must stink! Weirdo!\u201dKu Long smiled in embarrassment and leaned to the carriage, \u201cYoung Master Yan, Miss Zuo requests you to come out for water.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dShi Yan replied briefly, drew the curtain and walked out with a withered face.He looked dumb, his eyes puzzled, seemingly baffled by a certain problem.Without too much thought, he walked towards Zuo Shi slowly, grabbed the water bag from her hand, and then drank up.After that, he casually handed the bag back to Zuo Shi, who was rather angry, and turned back for his own carriage while mumbling, \u201cThat water was fragrant, so strange\u2026\u201d\u201cShi Yan!\u201dZuo Shi blushed in anger, \u201cThat water bag is mine! Not your Shi family\u2019s!\u201dShi Yan was shocked by her scream, and finally woke up from his deep thought on the [Seal of Life and Death]. He asked, \u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cXiao Shi just now drank from this water bag. Hehe. Of course it would be fragrant.\u201d Wu Yunlian smiled and joked, \u201cHaha, maybe there\u2019s still some of Xiao Shi\u2019s saliva in it!\u201d\u201cAunt Lian!\u201d Zuo Shi blushed and stamped on the ground, \u201cWhat the hell are you talking about!\u201dKu Long and Chu Ping were stunned, with their faces turning strange. Even Han Feng raised his head secretly to look in their direction.But soon, the three went on for their own business like nothing had happened, as if no one had heard Wu Yunlian\u2019s words or saw Zuo Shi\u2019s blushing face.Shi Yan realized it immediately, but he still pretended to know nothing and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s ok. I\u2019m easy-going. I don\u2019t hate your saliva at all.\u201dImmediately, he turned back joyfully and got back into the carriage at once, not showing up again.\u201cHaha! Hahahaha!\u201dWu Yunlian laughed too hard to stand steady as her breasts trembled. She suddenly felt that Shi Yan was not boring at all. His casual words were really hilarious.Zuo Shi was dumbstruck for a while, then her eyes widened and she cursed, \u201cShi Yan! You bastard!\u201d\u201cUncle Han, let\u2019s go.\u201d Shi Yan\u2019s calm voice came from the carriage.\u201cOkay.\u201d Han Feng\u2019s mouth formed a strange smile and he urged Ku Long, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dTheir carriage slowly started moving, and for the first time passed by the other carriage.Standing there with a red face, Zuo Shi first glanced over at Wu Yunlian, then at the silent Chu Ping, and said angrily, \u201cWhat are you laughing at? What\u2019s so funny? It\u2019s not amusing at all! You all are so lame!\u201dThen she swiftly slipped into the carriage and yelled, \u201cUncle Ping, be quick! Kick their carriage! Give that bastard a lesson!\u201dChu Ping was stunned, and looked to Wu Yunlian miserably.Wu Yunlian shook her head and jumped onto the carriage. She comforted Zuo Shi, \u201cCome on, Xiao Shi. Don\u2019t be angry. He didn\u2019t mean it.\u201d\u201cToo rude! He said\u2026 he said\u2026\u201d Zuo Shi grunted with indignation, but was too shy to continue.\u2014Shi Yan never took it seriously at all.In the carriage, Shi Yan was leaning back and frowning, while odd texts flashed across his mind.The ancient method of the [Seal of Life and Death] quickly flashed through his mind.Recently, he had wholeheartedly put all of his energy into learning the method.Even when he was having meals, his brain had never stopped thinking. He was trying so hard to understand the practice process of the seal that he was nearly going insane.He was that type of person.Once he was determined to do something, he would focus on it and use everything to realize it, never changing his mind.After so many years of practicing extreme sports, he came to the conclusion that only with obsession, could one do things perfectly![The Seal of Life and Death]! [The Seal of Life and Death]!At that time, there was only one thought in his mind; to understand the process of the [Seal of Life and Death] as soon as possible.It was best if he could master the seal before he went into the Dead Swamp.Only by mastering the seal could he be able to protect himself in the Dead Swamp, and have more opportunities to gain beneficial things.Closing his eyes, Shi Yan tried to relax, and began to sort out his recent understandings of the method.After a long while, he willed his Profound Qi to slowly move from his belly to his right arm.The Profound Qi didn\u2019t move fast, but it was concentrated and was refined with in his right arm.As the Profound Qi gathered in his right arm, the latter became transparent, and even the bone and veins in his hand could be seen clearly.Shi Yan didn\u2019t realize the strange changes in his arm.Eyes closed, he tried to execute the different the ideas that he came up with recently, and refined the Profound Qi in his arm many times.As his arm began to expand, Shi Yan made up his mind and pushed his Profound Qi toward his palm.\u201cChee chee chee!\u201dWisps of crystal Profound Qi flew out from his fingers like lightning.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThose five streams of Profound Qi looked alive, as they lingered around his fingers but never flew out far.\u201cStill not correct.\u201dShi Yan opened his eyes, and gazed at the Profound Qi on his fingertips. His face showed disappointment as he frowned and mumbled to himself, \u201cThere must be something wrong. It\u2019s not a sign of success. What on earth should I do?\u201dHis mumbles became softer, as he withdrew the Profound Qi from his fingers little by little.Shi Yan sank deep into his thoughts again, obsessively trying to find the truth of the seal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "Chapter 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 82 \u2013 A Step FurtherIn the following days, Shi Yan continued to remain in the carriage and no one knew what he was doing.Altogether, the two carriages travelled in the forest for nine days.In these nine days, both Zuo Shi and Wu Yunlian would come out time and time again to groom themselves on the riverside and collect water for everyone.Every time Shi Yan came out, he would bury himself in his food, and when he was done, he would hurry back into the carriage, without acknowledging the others.\u2014It was night again.The two carriages were parked under the dense foliage of the trees. The horses were released from their reins to graze nearby.After taking bath, both Zuo Shi and Wu Yunlian were leisurely lying in their carriage, teasing each other in whispers.Chu Ping, Han Feng, and Ku Long were guarding the carriages and horses, exchanging their cultivation experiences at the same time.In the carriage of the Shi family.Shi Yan\u2019s face was full of seriousness, his expression never being so dignified. After nine days of relentless study, he was finally able to gain some insights.Hi right arm was gleaming in light, and one could see some strange little white spots flowing through the veins in his arm.Strands of pure concentrated Profound Qi were repeatedly refined in his meridians. He kept using a special method to temper it.After the seventh time.Shi Yan\u2019s right arm, which was continuously expanding, soon grew a whole lot thicker! His muscles looked ferocious with veins popping out of them, looking very frightening.\u201cHa!\u201dShi Yan lightly shouted, his eyes grim. He kept his gaze on his right arm, and a thought suddenly struck his mind.His right arm abruptly let out a strange \u201cpopping\u201d sound.After the Profound Qi was refined seven times, it actually separated into seven different flows. The seven flows of power were dispersed into his meridians, with a clear distinction between them.When he put his concentration into his Profound Qi, the seven flows of Profound Qi suddenly converged onto his wrist. In an instant, those seven flows turned into one, and a lively aura suddenly gushed out from his right palm!Shi Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly became as bright as the galaxy, he immediately tried to stimulate that light formed by the seven flows of Profound Qi.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe seven flows of Profound Qi fiercely rushed into his palm. The center of Shi Yan\u2019s palm suddenly burst into bright rays. The mass of strange Profound Qi coagulation all of a sudden exploded in his palm!Countless light specks of Profound Qi instantly filled his palm. They flowed into the lines on his palm, making his hand shine with a strange light.Suddenly, the countless light specks fiercely shot out from the lines on his palm. The light specks were gleaming and unbelievably, formed into a strange handprint.A glistening handprint took off and flew out!Shi Yan\u2019s palm continuously exploded six more times, and six identical handprints formed into shape.The seven handprints were like unleashed horses, and randomly struck the carriage that Shi Yan was in.\u201cBoom boom boom boom boom boom boom!\u201dThe carriage broke into pieces. The solid wood planks became like sawdust, and flew into the air.Shi Yan just sat there on the ground with a serious expression. He looked at the smashed carriage and the flying sawdust around him in surprise.He could clearly feel that one-third of his Profound Qi had being consumed from this single move.Seven [Life Seals] burst out, and all the Profound Qi that had been gathered in his right arm was instantly sucked dry!When those seven [Life Seals] shot out, his right arm returned to normal, leaving only a slight tingly feeling.Zuo Shi and Wu Yunlian jumped out of the Zuo family\u2019s carriage in alarm. They gazed at this scene in shock.On the grass, Chu Ping, Han Feng, and Ku Long were also astonished, their faces full of confusion. They had no idea what happened.Shi Yan sat on the ground in a daze, he looked for a second, then coughed and said heartlessly, \u201cUncle Han, I think we have to ride the horses now.\u201dHan Feng\u2019s expression was very strange, he slightly nodded, and looked towards him perplexed.\u201cYoung Master Yan, what the hell are you doing?\u201dWu Yunlian\u2019s flirty little face was full of bewilderment, she stepped up along with Zuo Shi, and looked at Shi Yan weirdly, \u201cWhy did you suddenly destroy the carriage? Can you give us an explanation?\u201cI got carried away while practicing.\u201d Shi Yan shrugged, and said casually, \u201cThis is normal. Don\u2019t worry about it, the carriage is gone, but the horses are still here, it won\u2019t slow you guys down.\u201d\u201cAll this time you were in the carriage and refused to come out\u2026 was just for practice?\u201d Zuo Shi\u2019s pretty face was full of surprise.\u201cMmm hmm.\u201d\u201cSilly.\u201d Zuo Shi shook her head, and said in disdain, \u201cTraining is the most boring thing, your grandpa isn\u2019t forcing you or anything, why do you have to put in so much effort?\u201d\u201cHobby.\u201d\u201cPsh, I don\u2019t believe you.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Yan, what is the skill that you\u2019re practicing?\u201dWu Yunlian hesitated for a second, then her expression also slowly turned normal again, \u201cThe power that was unleashed back in that moment, was extremely violent and fierce. That instant explosive force, shouldn\u2019t be something that an ordinary Human Realm warrior should have\u2026\u201d Wu Yunlian said thoughtfully.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201d Shi Yan smiled, he didn\u2019t want to explain further. He stretched and said to Han Feng, \u201cUncle Han, my stomach is hungry, get me something to eat.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dSeeing that Shi Yan didn\u2019t want to say anything more, Wu Yunlian didn\u2019t ask for more details. She smiled and took Zuo Shi away with her.After gorging down a bunch of food.Shi Yan said to Han Feng, \u201cUncle Han, I\u2019m going to go wash myself. I\u2019ll come back in a bit, you don\u2019t need to come along.\u201d\u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201d Han Feng hesitated.\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Waving his hand, Shi Yan reassured him, \u201cI won\u2019t walk very far, if there\u2019s anything I\u2019ll holler. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cBe careful, Young Master.\u201d\u2014Shi Yan quickly arrived at the riverbank. He jumped into the river and joyfully took a bath and changed into a fresh set of clothes.After coming ashore, instead of rushing to return to the gathering point where Han Feng and the rest were, he moved further away from them.\u2014Under an old tree.Shi Yan\u2019s expression was solemn, he suddenly invoked the negative energies in his body!In the meridians all over his body, there hid the different negative energies of bloodlust, fear, slaughter, and desperation. They all emerged, and under his will, the negative powers all flowed towards his left arm.The shrivelled left arm was covered with white mist. The mist shifted unpredictably, like the faint shadows of ghosts.His mind flicked.Following to the circulation method of the right arm, Shi Yan started invoking the negative energies in his left arm.Under his control, the already shrivelled left arm became even more shrivelled and shrunken.Looking at that, it was like as if there was only a layer of skin pressing on his bones, which appeared very strange.However, as his left arm shriveled up, a mass of extremely evil power started slowly growing.The thick white mist on his left arm shortly turned pitch black. The arm was also frighteningly black, as if it was heavily toxic.A mass of maniacal, evil, destructive power quickly condensed in his left arm.After seven full cycles, the power in his left arm flowed down into his left palm using the same technique as his right arm, and together they burst from his left palm!\u201cBoom boom boom boom boom boom boom!\u201dFollowing the explosion, seven pitch black handprints flew out from his palms.The destructive power, along with the thick essence of death, all struck the old tree in front of him.The old tree was as thick as two people\u2019s waists and around a dozen meters tall. It suddenly collapsed onto the ground. The life force of the lush old tree was instantly cut off!Under the watchful eyes of Shi Yan, the old tree was surrounded by a swirling black energy. The leaves withered with visible speed.The lively old tree looked like it had instantly reached the end of its lifespan and turned into a withered husk of a tree that could not be deader. The leaves that fell from it promptly lost all traces of life.The leaves fell onto the ground and the surrounding leaves looked as if they were also affected, and instantly died. The scene was extremely strange.The [Death Seal]!Shi Yan\u2019s eyes glinted with an odd light, and his mind was slightly startled.He knew that the [Death Seal] would be very extraordinary, but what he did not know was that it would have such an astonishing destructive force!This kind of destructive power was not only astounding in strength, but more importantly, this [Death Seal] additionally came with the power of Death!It could actually cut off the life force in plants!The [Death Seal] is already this frightening. If the [Life Seal] and [Death Seal] merged together, forming the true [Seal of Life and Death], what would happen?Shi Yan took a deep breath in, but he knew that this was not the time to continue experimenting.He heard the sound of footsteps.Shi Yan immediately knew that Han Feng and the rest had definitely rushed here. His expression shifted for a moment, then he hurriedly left, and quickly took the same route back.As expected, Han Feng and Ku Long hastily arrived, they exclaimed from afar, \u201cYoung Master, are you alright?\u201dWu Yunlian and Zuo Shi also poked their heads out from behind Han Feng, they looked at him surprisingly, like they came to figure out what happened.They all clearly heard that violent thundering sound back there. And in that sound, there seemed to be a mass of evil power.This made Han Feng and the rest secretly frightened, their minds filled with confusion.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, let\u2019s go back.\u201d Shi Yan calmly walked towards them, seemingly unconcerned, \u201cI got carried away again while I was practicing, I think it generated some bad phenomenons. But it\u2019s nothing, it won\u2019t happen next time.\u201d\u201cShi Yan, what Martial Skill are you practicing? Why do I think what you\u2019re practicing is not some ordinary Martial Skill?\u201d Zuo Shi couldn\u2019t hold back anymore, her face was full of curiosity.\u201cWho cares if it\u2019s ordinary or not. Any Martial Skill that can kill is a good one!\u201d Shi Yan said indifferently.\u201cYou little guy! Always acting so mysterious! God knows what you\u2019re really doing.\u201d Zuo Shi curled her lips, feeling a little discontent. She snorted and finally said, \u201cCome on, hurry up. It\u2019s been almost a month. If we\u2019re late, that Xia girl won\u2019t necessarily wait for us.\u201d\u201cXia Xin Yan\u2026\u201dShi Yan murmured, and suddenly remembered the wonderful taste of that woman\u2019s lips. His heart could not help but skip a beat. A shady look appeared on his face, and after a long while he finally nodded and said, \u201cYeah, we should move faster. Don\u2019t worry, I won\u2019t slow you guys down any more.\u201d\u201cShi Yan, you can\u2019t possibly be thinking of hitting on that woman?\u201d Wu Yunlian\u2019s eyes were sharp. From his micro expressions she saw some clues, and then made a fuss, \u201cI\u2019d recommend you to back down! That woman is trouble. From what I see, no man in the Merchant Union would be qualified to make a move on her, not even Beiming Shang!\u201d\u201cWell I had already tasted her.\u201d Shi Yan retorted in his mind.Shi Yan snorted, then said in disdain, \u201cNo matter how noble or how beautiful a woman is, in the end she\u2019s going to lay on a man\u2019s bed anyway. Xia Xin Yan is no exception!\u201d\u201cYou! You are so vulgar!\u201d Zuo Shi\u2019s face flushed, and she shot a glare at him, \u201cHow did I not realize this before? So this is your true nature! You are a perverted man too!\u201d\u201cBullshit!\u201d Wu Yunlian was also upset, \u201cI\u2019ve never laid on anyone\u2019s bed! You little punk, truly nothing decent can come out of that filthy mouth!\u201d\u201cHuh, then poor you.\u201d Shi Yan was surprised.\u201cBrat! Why are you getting on my nerves now?\u201d Wu Yunlian clenched her teeth, and said bitterly.

And although they were three li apart, the three people from the Misty Pavilion still clearly heard what he said.\u201cNo matter how noble or how beautiful a woman is, in the end she\u2019s going to lay on a man\u2019s bed anyway. Xia Xin Yan is no exception!\u201dXia Xin Yan frowned, as she silently repeated Shi Yan\u2019s words in her mind. Her bright eyes flashed with a cold look, and she said indifferently, \u201cThose people are from the Zuo and the Shi families. We don\u2019t need to care about them now, soon we will meet with them.

But he still found a way to continue practising the [Seal of Life and Death].Every night, whenever he had free time, he would make an excuse to leave and put into action the knowledge gained throughout the morning.However, every time he tried to join the [Life Seal] with the [Death Seal], the result was always a failure.The merging of the [Seal of Life and Death] was very difficult. Every time he formed the [Life Seal] and [Death Seal], he was unable to project them simultaneously.Either that the [Life Seal] was executed first, or the [Death Seal] suddenly lashed out.If one wanted to merge them to form the true [Seal of Life and Death], the very first step would be to execute both types of Seals simultaneously.Only if this was achieved, could the [Seal of Life and Death] be formed.This required extreme control. It has to be mentioned that the condensing of his Profound Qi and the negative energies must be synergetic; existence of any flaw was out of question!Shi Yan was aware of this. However, every time he tried to put his thoughts into action, he found the process to be very difficult, and all his attempts ended in total failure.Noting that they were getting nearer to the Dead Swamp day by day, Shi Yan stopped his practice. After all, the simultaneous consumption of Profound Qi and negative energy was huge.Every time he practiced, his body would weaken for a while.Especially when forming the [Death Seal].It required using [Rampage] first, however there would always be some backlash. In order be in top condition while in the Dead Swamp, Shi Yan reluctantly stopped his attempts.Determined that he wasn\u2019t going to stress out anymore, Shi Yan was more relaxed. As he no longer spent his time in meditation for the upcoming journey, he had plenty of time to interact with the two girls, Wu Yunlian and Zuo Shi.While travelling together for some time, Shi Yan gained some understanding of Wu Yunlian and Zuo Shi. They didn\u2019t especially get along very well, but they didn\u2019t have any conflicts either.\u2014On this day.Shi Yan was riding his horse alongside the carriage of Zuo family. His expression was serene, and he was still deep in thought about the [Seal of Life and Death].\u201cYoung Master, we\u2019re here.\u201d At this moment, Han Feng pointed forward, and said quietly, \u201cThe people from Misty Pavilion are already waiting.\u201dShi Yan stared and gazed into the distance, spotting three black dots.Wu Yunlian also stuck her head out, looking into the distance. She then whispered, \u201cEveryone be careful. Misty Pavilion is an outsider to us. That woman can reach the Sky Realm, so let\u2019s just watch out.\u201dHearing that, everyone nodded.Shi Yan, however, furrowed his brows slightly. He didn\u2019t know how Xia Xin Yan would react after seeing him.On that day, before Xia Xin Yan fainted, she had clearly seen him. Xia Xin Yan definitely knew now why she was at the Misty Rain House.During this meeting, who knows if Xia Xin Yan would interrogate him or not.But Shi Yan wasn\u2019t particularly worried. At the Misty Rain House, the only time he really violated Xia Xin Yan was when she was unconscious.Xia Xin Yan should not know what he had done.\u2014Xia Xin Yan never separated far from Shi Yan and the rest. Although she had nonchalantly tossed out the half-part of the map, inwardly she was still cautious of them. She was constantly on guard towards the Shi and Zuo families in order to prevent them from taking any covert action without her knowledge.That day, when Shi Yan had commented on her, she had heard it clearly. She was naturally agitated from inside.But when she saw Shi Yan, she recognised him as the one who had brought her to the brothel. This made her even angrier.What happened that day was deeply imprinted into her memory.Many times in the past several nights, whenever Xia Xin Yan woke, she would still feel herself lying in the Misty Rain House\u2026And whenever she thought about it, she would imagine herself lying unconscious on the ground while that guy enjoyed himself with the two prostitutes right in front of her.She felt unreasonably angry.Finally, Shi Yan was right in front of her.Xia Xin Yan only glanced at Shi Yan once, then she pointed at him and said coldly, \u201cYou follow me, I have some things to ask you.\u201dWu Yunlian, Zuo Shi, and Han Feng were all shocked. They looked at Xia Xin Yan weirdly, not understanding why she would want to talk with Shi Yan alone, instead of asking for Chi Xiao\u2019s whereabouts.Shi Yan had already expected her to do that, so he nodded and said calmly, \u201cOkay.\u201dShi Yan\u2019s attitude made Wu Yunlian and the rest even more confused.Han Feng was stupefied for a second, slightly worried, \u201cYoung Master\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright.\u201d Shi Yan waved his hand, and left along with Xia Xin Yan.Shortly, the two arrived under an old tree.\u201cThat day, it was you, right?\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s bright eyes looked straight at him, and asked indifferently.\u201cMmm hmm.\u201d\u201cThat day at the brothel, while I was unconscious, you did\u2026 that with the two prostitutes?\u201d Xia Xin Yan secretly clenched her teeth.\u201cMmm hmm.\u201d\u201cYou are the most perverted bastard!\u201dShi Yan couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He nodded and said calmly, \u201cI\u2019m a man, this is my nature, there\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of. But, I don\u2019t suppose I did anything to you? In fact, I saved your life! That night, if you weren\u2019t at the brothel, the Beiming family might have found you. On that note, you should thank me.\u201dXia Xin Yan was a bit stunned. It seemed she didn\u2019t expect Shi Yan to honestly admit his lechery in front of her.Xia Xin Yan was in a fix and her expression was changing continuously. It was as if she very much wanted to scold Shi Yan, but didn\u2019t know where to start.To scold him that he\u2019s perverted? Well, he\u2019s already admitted that. He\u2019s already so shameless, what\u2019s the use in scolding him further?Xia Xin Yan felt agitated for no apparent reason. After a long while she frustratingly shook her head and said, \u201cYou did save me, but I\u2019m not grateful to you! What happened that night, I don\u2019t want anyone to know, do you understand?\u201dXia Xin Yan\u2019s beautiful eyes were cold, her intention of a threat was clear.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not that stupid.\u201d Shi Yan\u2019s expression was indifferent.\u201cThat, that night, did you\u2026 did you do anything else to me?\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly showed a little panic.\u201cAnything else?\u201d Shi Yan was stunned, his face full of confusion, \u201cLike what?\u201dListening to this, Xia Xin Yan was raged from inside, and she was continuously repeating the word \u2018Calm\u2019 inside her mind. She took some deep breaths and finally said in a cold tone, \u201cI\u2019m saying did you have any ill intentions of me?\u201d\u201cOf course yeah!\u201d Shi Yan whispered in his mind, but on the surface he looked serious and shook his head, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not a reckless person.\u201d\u201cYou are not a reckless person?!\u201dXia Xin Yan was staring at Shi Yan. She suddenly realised that she was very easily getting angry when near this person. Clenching her teeth, she sneered and said again, \u201cA perverted bastard who thought of seeking pleasure in a brothel while his family was in a death battle with their enemies. And you say you are not a reckless person? Isn\u2019t this really the funniest thing!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a normal physiological need.\u201d Shi Yan said indifferently.Xia Xin Yan started at him blankly, her eyes repeatedly showing feelings of disgust and anger.Xia Xin Yan slightly waved her hand as if she wanted to say no more. Finally she said, \u201cI wish you forget everything that happened that night! You saved my life once, and I will remember that. During this exploration of the Gate of Heaven, I will make sure to do whatever I can to keep you safe. After that, we\u2019re even!\u201dXia Xin Yan could not bear to stay any longer. She turned around and left straight back along the path she came. She was still filled with anger, but there was nowhere for her to release it.\u201cThen I will thank you in advance.\u201d Shi Yan shouted loudly towards her retreating figure. A smile still lingered on his lips, as if he had no idea how annoyed Xia Xin Yan was.\u2014In the mass of dark clouds on the sky.A ten-meter long, Level 5 demon beast; a Wind Eagle, floated in the clouds. Beiming Shang, Beiming Ce, Yin Kui, Jiu Shan, Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan sat together on the Wind Eagle.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBeiming Shang sat on the head of the Wind Eagle; he reached his head out to look down at Shi Yan and the rest, who looked as small as ants. Then with a deep voice he said, \u201cThey should be going to the Dead Swamp.\u201d\u201cGrandpa, when should we show up?\u201d\u201cWait until they arrive at their destination.\u201d Beiming Shang furrowed his brows, and said, \u201cChi Xiao should be appearing soon. Chi Xiao is a true Sky Realm warrior and he might discover us. Let\u2019s go, we should leave in advance.\u201dMu Yu Die clenched her fist, her bright eyes filled with hope.The Wind Eagle suddenly flew off, and quickly became a black dot as it swiftly flew towards the Dead Swamp, not leaving any trace of its passing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 84": "Chapter 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 84 \u2013 The Dead SwampChi Xiao arrived two days later, and thus the team to explore the Gate of Heaven was complete.The Dead Swamp was comprised of thousands of swamps of all different sizes.These had existed for centuries. Whoever stepped into these would most likely be unable to escape and eventually drown.It was hard to travel in the swamps, so the carriage and horses were left at the entrance, and the team started walking into the Dead Swamp.Once they stepped into it, Shi Yan was on alert so as to avoid any dangers.There were endless green swamps in the Dead Swamp. Of which, many of them were emitting a green colored air.In some places, the air was so poisonous that people would rot to death as soon as they inhaled it.Apart from the swamps and poisonous air, there were also demon beats.The demon beasts had adapted to the environment. They would usually hide in the swamps and jump out to attack whenever people passed by.Chi Xiao and Xia Xin Yan were taking the lead and avoiding all the small sized swamps.Chi Xiao was a Sky Realm warrior, so he could avoid the swamp by flying in the air.Though he didn\u2019t feel fear, the others did. Even Xia Xin Yan could only reach Sky Realm when she operated her Incarnation Martial Spirit. Only then could she fly.However, every time Xia Xin Yan used her Incarnation Martial Spirit, her vitality would be damaged.Therefore, Xia Xin Yan rarely used it unless it was an emergency. She was quite cautious along the way, following Chi Xiao\u2019s lead.Shi Yan\u2019s realm was the lowest among them, and so was his knowledge about this world.Thus, after they entered the Dead Swamp, he kept mute, carefully observing the dangers in the swamp as well as Chi Xiao and other people\u2019s reactions.\u201cThere is a three-mile long swamp in front of us which we can\u2019t avoid.\u201d Chi Xiao paused, standing on a wet area and frowned, \u201cThis swamp should be the safest one around this area. Be careful, we need to take the risk this time.\u201dWearing a rigid face, Shi Yan observed the swamp in front of him with furrowed brows.The swamp was three miles long and filled with green mud. At the center of which there were pieces of dry land, enough for two or three people to stand on.Some of those dry lands were dozens of meters away while some were only two or three meters apart. It would only be safe to pass this swamp by walking on the dry areas.However, Chi Xiao\u2019s next statement crashed his plans.\u201cDon\u2019t even hope that the dry areas could hold people. It will sink even faster once you step on some of them. Many of those dry patches just float on the swamp and can\u2019t sustain any weight. Once you step on it, it will quickly sink.\u201dShi Yan turned serious in surprise, not saying anything.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will test every dry area so that you can walk on the solid ones.\u201d Chi Xiao saw through their worries and smiled, \u201cYou guys just need to follow me. It will be fine. But some of the dry areas are quite small, they may support my weight, but not three or four people. So we still need to be careful.\u201dEverybody nodded with a rigid face. Even Zuo Shi, who was quite relaxed before, got a little nervous and observed the dry lands before her cautiously.\u201cMiss Xia, there may be a lot of danger. Could you help me with your Sky Realm energy?\u201d Chi Xiao hesitated, and looked to Xia Xin Yan.Xia Xin Yan\u2019s crystal eyes showed hesitation behind her veil. After a thought, she said, \u201cMr. Chi Xiao, if you can handle it by yourself, please do so. I will be quite weak for a while after using my Sky Realm energy. I want to save my energy for the Nine-headed Sky Snake, but not these swamps.\u201dHearing that, Zuo Shi and Wu Yun Lian secretly frowned.They assumed she didn\u2019t want to help and regard them as her friends. Therefore, they were a little disappointed, though they didn\u2019t show it.Chi Xiao didn\u2019t mind though, as he nodded, \u201cWell then, let me do it. But you have to be more careful since Miss Xia isn\u2019t able to help. Don\u2019t step anywhere randomly without my confirmation. It will be tough even for me to save you once you sink into the mud.\u201dThe group nodded together seriously.\u201cHmm, follow me.\u201d Chi Xiao took a light breath and flew over and landed on a dry patch.He placed one foot on it and it sank immediately into the mud.Shi Yan\u2019s expression changed slightly with solemnness crossing his eyes. He suddenly realized that this journey may not be as smooth as he had imagined, thus he had to be more focused.Chi Xiao was calm. Seeing the earth sink, he remarked, \u201cYou see, this piece can\u2019t even hold one person. If you jump onto it, you will sink with it.\u201dWhile talking, he flew up again and landed on another piece of dry land. That piece was quite solid, not sinking at all.\u201cThis is ok. But still be careful. It may be dangerous if more people land on it.\u201d Chi Xiao stamped as he reminded others.The land under him shook and slowly sank again.\u201cThis can support three persons. No more than three people can stand on it when you pass through.\u201d Chi Xiao explained and flew out again. Using the same method, he tested more dry patches.Waiting until Chi Xiao flew a hundred meters away, Xia Xin Yan said calmly, \u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dThen, she moved her well-shaped body and lightly dropped on that dry area.After a second, she moved again to the next safe area and advanced after Chi Xiao swiftly.The two huge men who were following her didn\u2019t hesitate either, as they stepped one after another onto the dry areas to keep up with her.Zuo Shi, Wu Yun Lian and Chu Ping followed up, lining along the road where Xia Xian Yan had passed.\u201cYoung Master, after you.\u201d Han Feng bowed to Shi Yan, \u201cBe careful.\u201d\u201cMmm.\u201d Shi Yan nodded, skipped forward, and slowly moved after Zuo Shi.There was a light acidic smell upon the swamp.After they advanced in the swamp for a mile, Shi Yan found some green bubbles rising out from it, and green gas appeared as the bubbles exploded.\u201cBe careful, that green gas is poisonous. Don\u2019t breathe in.\u201d Chi Xiao\u2019s voice came from ahead, \u201cWe are all at high realm so it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for us to hold our breath for a while. I will find the way as soon as possible, please follow up.\u201dChi Xiao didn\u2019t stop advancing as he was talking. Hopping on and off the dry areas, he kept reporting, \u201cThis is ok. But be careful, it can only contain two people\u2026\u201dShi Yan focused his eyes on Chi Xiao and remembered his steps by heart.At that time, he quite admired the warriors at Sky Realm, for they could fly over this swamp without suffering so much trouble.His desire for more strength and to reach a higher realm became much stronger.With Chi Xiao ahead of them, the group found it much easier to advance. Everybody, except Chi Xiao, was rather relaxed.They were all safe in this dangerous swamp where numerous warriors had lost their lives.However, just as they were about to exit this swamp, Chi Xiao\u2019s expression changed as he screamed, \u201cWatch out! Something\u2019s in the mud!\u201d\u201cPop! Pop! Pop!\u201dThree demon beasts wrapped in mud suddenly rose up from the swamp, and jumped toward Shi Yan and Xia Xin Yan.This type of demon beasts looked like loaches, with needle-like teeth and sharp bones on their back.Three demon beasts jumped out of the mud, as two of them dashed toward Xiao Xin Yan and the other one towards Shi Yan.Shi Yan looked calm. Just as the demon beast was about to touch him, he stretched out his right hand which petrified immediately and operated his [Finger Spear] toward that beast!(TL note: [Finger Spear] was previously named [Finger Gun].)\u201cChee!\u201dThe demon beast bit Shi Yan\u2019s right arm but couldn\u2019t crush it. On the contrary, its head was pierced by Shi Yan\u2019s fingers, green blood oozed out of its head before collapsing into the swamp.\u201cBoom boom!\u201dTwo huge booms came from Xia Xin Yan\u2019s side.Shi Yan turned back to find that the two demon beasts had exploded before they could approached Xia Xin Yan and fell into the swamp.A numb feeling came from his right palm which was covered by green blood. Shi Yan frowned and took out a soft rag from his bag to wipe the blood away.One after another, odd demon beasts showed up from the green, bubble-covered swamp; their numbers reaching about one hundred by a rough count.Those demon beasts gazed at them with hatred as if they were about to pick someone to eat.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cShi Yan, did you get any green blood from the Green Loach on your skin?\u201d Chi Xiao suddenly screamed from the front of the troop.Shi Yan wiped the green blood away casually and turned his eyes to Chi Xiao, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d\u201cThe Green Loach has too much poisonous gas in its body, so their blood is poisonous too and will rot your skin!\u201d Chi Xiao was rather regretful, \u201cI had meant to tell you after we passed this swamp, for the Green Loach rarely appears in this area.\u201d\u201cChi Xiao, what are you doing here again?\u201dA hairless ugly man covered in mud slowly stood up from the swamp.

Don\u2019t you dare make a fuss!\u201dAt the same time, Chi Xiao took out a small curtain and expanded it at once, covering the whole group.The poisonous rain fell on the silver curtain and trailed through the edges, immediately emitting poisonous fumes when falling in the swamp.\u201cSilver Curtain!\u201dFace twisted, the ugly man shouted, \u201cYou took out your Silver Curtain! Chi Xiao, you must want to have a good fight with me this time!\u201d\u201cStop it!\u201d Seeing the ugly man, Zhua Qi, about to act, Chi Xiao hurried to stop him, \u201cZhua Qi, you are mistaken about me this time! I haven\u2019t come here to fight with you but the Nine-headed Sky Snake! And I only took out my Silver Curtain to block the snake\u2019s poison, not to trap you!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t buy it!\u201d Zhua Qi laughed coldly, \u201cYou want to fight the Nine-headed Sky Snake alone? Who would even believe that? Humph! You have no grudge against the Nine-headed Sky Snake. You must have come for me!\u201dAfter a grunt, Zhua Qi immersed one hand into the swamp and soon, streams of odd green light shot into the mud.One after another, mud dragons jumped out of the swamp. They were as thick as a human waist and were about ten meters tall, trying to bite their group.Zhua Qi could not only control the miasma in the Dead Swamp, but could also control the mud.Shi Yan\u2019s expression changed slightly, as he didn\u2019t expect themselves facing such a tough enemy right at the beginning of their journey. He was immediately vigilant, circulating his Profound Qi and prepared to attack those mud dragons.Those mud dragons flew out from the swamps swiftly and moved towards the group from all directions. It was quite magnificent.The dry land on which the group was currently standing on was continuously sinking into the swamp under Zhua Qi\u2019s control.Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes turned icy as she decided to use her Incarnation Martial Spirit.\u201cZhua Qi! Believe me! I haven\u2019t come for you!\u201d Chi Xiao yelled anxiously.Chi Xiao was fully assured that he could beat Zhua Qi, but the consequence to their group would be dreadful He firmly believed that once they entered into battle, only he and Xia Xin Yan could withstand Zhua Qi\u2019s attacks.\u201cShi Yan, come here. I will protect you.\u201d Xia Xin Yan glanced over him and said without any emotion.Han Feng and Ku Long were surprised, and looked at Xia Xin Yan in confusion.So were Wu Yun Lian and Zuo Shi. It was unreasonable that Xia Xin Yan would try to protect Shi Yan.Shi Yan dared not take the risk, so he hopped through the dry lands to Xia Xin Yan\u2019s side.\u201cZhua Qi!\u201dChi Xiao was astounded, \u201cThe Gate of Heaven is in the Yin Valley! I came for the Nine-headed Sky Snake! Stop now!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhua Qi was quite surprised as he screamed, \u201cThe Gate of Heaven?\u201d\u201cYes. We got a treasure map. And the Gate of Heaven turned out to be located in the Yin Valley!\u201d Chi Xiao had to tell him the truth.Zhua Qi was stunned, and then giggled cunningly.As he was giggling, the green miasma in the air began to float away from the group.As the green miasma dispersed, the poisonous rain stopped as well.The flying mud dragons turned back to mud and fell into the center of the swamp.Hundreds of green loaches which were rushing up also stopped as they saw the mud dragons disappear. Under Zhua Qi\u2019s order, they went back under the mud as well.Zhua Qi then stopped.Chi Xiao was relieved and stretched his hand up into the air and shrunk the curtain, finally falling into his palm.The swamp went back to serenity. Even the green bubbles gradually disappeared. The dangerous swamp suddenly became quiet.\u201cI know you want to beat the Nine-headed Sky Snake too.\u201d Chi Xiao grunted and reproached in a rage, \u201cI bet you would have regretted it if you had stopped too late!\u201dAs he was speaking, he looked at Xia Xin Yan.Chi Xiao could compete with Zhua Qi alone, and with Xia Xin Yan at the Sky Realm, Zhua Qi would have been in great trouble.Zhua Qi looked towards Xia Xin Yan as he noticed Chi Xiao\u2019s gaze, and frowned.He could feel a stream of forceful power subsiding in her body.Just from a glance, Zhua Qi noticed that this woman was unmanageable, and she was operating some tricks secretly.Shi Yan stood by Xia Xin Yan with a gloomy face, still gazing at Zhua Qi vigilantly.Without taking a look at Shi Yan, Xia Xin Yan said calmly, \u201cMr. Chi Xiao, can you introduce this swamp master to us?\u201d\u201cHe is just a co-master.\u201dChi Xiao shook his head with disdain, glancing at Zhua Qi who was rather unhappy with him and said, \u201cZhua Qi is active in the outer area of the Dead Swamp, where there are small swamps and miasma. However, at the center of the Dead Swamp, that is to say, the Yin Field, the Nine-headed Sky Snake takes control. There is no way he could take charge there.\u201d\u201cChi Xiao! The Yin Field is mine!\u201d Zhua Qi suddenly cried out, \u201cMy father practiced there! I will get it back sooner or later!\u201d\u201cTill you get it back.\u201d Chi Xiao smirked, and nodded to Xia Xin Yan, \u201cMiss Xia, walk to the bank now.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Xia Xin Yan nodded, glanced at Shi Yan with her brows furrowed, and said indifferently, \u201cLeave now.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dShi Yan responded casually and hopped through the dry lands where Chi Xiao had tested, to a muddy area ahead, and soon he was ashore.Zhua Qi grunted, moved his muddy body swiftly in the swamp, and also reached the shore. But half of his body was still in the swamp, for he was still a little suspicious of Chi Xiao.\u201cShi Yan, how are you now? The blood of the green loach didn\u2019t hurt you? Do you need Zhua Qi\u2019s help you remove it?\u201d Chi Xiao asked as he suddenly recalled the incident.Standing there, Shi Yan looked down to his palm and shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m fine.\u201dHis Immortal Martial Spirit had cleaned the poison before he knew it.Hearing that, Chi Xiao and Zhua Qi looked at him in surprise.Only these two knew that a Human Realm warrior would suffer fatigue for at least one day after touching the green loach\u2019s blood.Others didn\u2019t know about the blood, so they didn\u2019t care much and walked ahead.Soon, Zuo Shi, Han Feng and others also got out of the swamp and landed ashore.\u201cChi Xiao, you really came for the Snake?\u201d Zhua Qi raised his head and asked, while half of his body was still in the mud.\u201cBehave yourself for the rest of our journey. Take the lead if you want to fight the Snake.\u201d Chi Xiao nodded.\u201cSure! Of course I will help if your goal is the Snake.\u201d Zhua Qi was cooperative this time, \u201cI will send you to the Yin Field nice and safe. But I will go there too, as my father once practiced there and I\u2019m familiar with it. I can help.\u201d\u201cApart from the Snake, you also want to enter the Gate of Heaven.\u201d Chi Xiao grunted.Zhua Qi didn\u2019t deny it, but giggled, \u201cYou know the Snake\u2019s power well. You can hardly beat it. Let me help you and in turn you let me into the Gate of Heaven; it\u2019s a win-win situation.\u201d\u201cMiss Xia, what do you think?\u201dChi Xiao didn\u2019t reply Zhua Qi, but looked to Xia Xin Yan, \u201cZhua Qi and the Nine-headed Sky Snake are old enemies. The outer area of the Dead Swamp is his sphere of influence. We won\u2019t come across any trouble if he takes the lead for us, and we are more likely to beat the Snake with his help.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Xia Xin Yan thought for a moment and nodded.\u201cWell then, you are in.\u201d Chi Xiao then replied to him.\u201cHehe, you won\u2019t regret.\u201d Zhua Qi smiled cunningly, then he was a little stunned, \u201cChi Xiao, is there anyone else?\u201d\u201cNope.\u201d Chi Xiao was stunned, \u201cOnly us.\u201d\u201cThen why did a Sky Realm warrior enter the Dead Swamp with several experts seven days ago?\u201d Zhua Qi asked, \u201cI killed some of his people, and fought with him so I know that he is at Sky Realm. I never left my Dead Swamp, so I don\u2019t know who he was. But he was really something. He must have reached the Yin Field by now.\u201d\u201cA Sky Realm Expert!\u201d Chi Xiao\u2019s expression changed and he thought for a moment, \u201cThe Fire Empire, the God-blessed Empire, and the Merchant Union all rarely see a Sky Realm warrior. Who could that man be? What did he look like?\u201d\u201cThin, tall, pale-faced, narrow eyes. He seemed to rarely expose himself to the sun, and trained in a gruesome Martial Skill.\u201d Zhua Qi thought for a while and depicted.\u201cI don\u2019t know who that is either.\u201d Chi Xian pondered for a while only to realise that he didn\u2019t know that man, so he shook his head, \u201cNever mind, maybe he just happened to pass the Dead Swamp and has already left by now. Anyway, we have to be on alert.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let me show you to the Yin Field.\u201dZhua Qi finally landed ashore. His legs were covered with green scales. He seemed not used to walking, for he swayed like a duck.However, they all had witnessed his ability, they didn\u2019t dare make fun of his hilarious walking posture.As the master of this area, wherever he went, the poisonous miasma dissipated quickly.There were many pieces of dry land ahead for them to advance smoothly.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThey found it much easier to walk after Zhua Qi took the lead. They finished the one-month journey in only eight days.Eight days later, the group finally entered the Yin Field.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Translated by: QianEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 86 \u2013 The Yin FieldThe Yin Field was a place in the center of the Dead Swamp.The Dead Swamp was surrounded by countless swamps; the muddy sludge could be seen everywhere. There was almost not a single dry spot.However, the Yin Field at the middle of the Dead Swamp was an exception.Here, there were no swamps, and no ooze. The ground was mostly flat, and although not especially dry, it was still not as humid as the outer area of the Dead Swamp.The Yin field was an extraordinary place. The air above the field was covered with thick dark clouds all year around, such that not even the sun, moon, and the stars could be seen.Perhaps that was the reason why the Yin Qi in the Yin Field was especially heavy. Anyone who enters would feel very uncomfortable.The place didn\u2019t appear to be frigid, but the Yin energy all around made people chilled to their bones. One would feel as if they had entered a supernatural space, surrounded by evil spirits; it felt very creepy.When Shi Yan just entered into the Yin field, he frowned slightly. He took a deep breath and felt discomfort seep into his bones. Although it wasn\u2019t very chilly here, it still made people uncomfortable all over.Standing on the frigid earth, Shi Yan gazed around and found some strange exotic plants growing.These plants were not very tall, the tallest being only five to six meters, but they all grew in the weirdest pattern. There were various plants with very pale flowers, absolutely lacking any variance in color.Especially with some plants, their flowers looked like ghastly faces, giving off an extremely terrifying feeling.Just standing in the middle of those bizarre plants made Shi Yan feel uncomfortable. When he looked at those plants, he always felt like they were going to leap towards him and bite him.\u201cThe Yin Qi here is heavy, the plants that grew from it are very strange. Some plants could even suck in the Yin Qi and the corpse energies. While some others would attack as soon as they smell the breath of a human, and entangle onto that human until they die.\u201dZhua Qi scowled as he looked at the different plants in the Yin Field and then continued, \u201cOther than plants, you should also be careful of demon beasts. The demon beasts here especially hate strangers. If they see anyone coming, they will attack until you are dead. Usually when warriors go through the Dead Swamp, they would rather explore the outer perimeter than in here.\u201d\u201cSlither, slither, slither!\u201dSilvery-white long snakes suddenly appeared from within the plants.These snakes were about three meters in length. Their heads were cone shaped, and their tails kept making circular marks on the ground. Their soybean-sized eyes gave out a cold glare.Several dozens of snakes slithered out from the plants. They actually understood how to split up, and came from all directions to surround Shi Yan and the rest.\u201cLevel 2 demon beast, Corpse Worm Snake.\u201d Zhua Qi sneered, and suddenly stomped on the ground.Strange ripples spread from his foot! With him as the center, the ripples formed in ring shapes, and attacked towards all directions.\u201cPop pop pop pop! Pop pop pop!\u201dWherever the ripples went, those dozens of Level 2 Corpse Worm Snakes exploded, sprinkling brown blood everywhere.\u201cI hate snakes the most!\u201d Zhua Qi sneered, his face full of disgust. He turned back to Chi Xiao and said, \u201cBefore we come across the Nine-headed Sky Snake, I\u2019ll take care of the obstacles on the way. I\u2019ll let this be the bargain in return for participating in the Gate of Heaven.\u201dChi Xiao nodded, and replied, \u201cYou know this place well, so you can take the lead.\u201dZhua Qi didn\u2019t refuse and walked straight to the front of the group. Traces of strange green poisonous fog quietly spread out into the air.When the plants in the Yin Field sensed the poisonous fog from him, they all contracted, as if they were actually afraid.Many of the plants were originally three meters tall, but after Zhua Qi walked past, they shrunk to only one meter, clearly a whole lot smaller.Shi Yan was amazed; he watched with glinting eyes. Whenever he walked past those plants he would carefully observe them. He realized that wherever Zhua Qi went, the plants were very docile and submissive.However, if he didn\u2019t follow behind Zhua Qi and chose to walk a few meters in another direction, those same species of plants would actually open themselves up and try to entangle him, looking as if they wouldn\u2019t give up till he was strangled to death.\u201cKid, if you don\u2019t want to die, you better follow me.\u201d Zhua Qi suddenly turned his head and glared at Shi Yan. In his mouth he was quietly muttering, \u201cI don\u2019t understand all of you. You knew that you were gonna enter the Yin Field, but still brought two burdens along. Do they wanna sacrifice them later at a key moment\u2026?\u201dThe burdens Zhua Qi was muttering about were obviously Shi Yan and Zuo Shi. They both were only at the Human Realm, the ones with the lowest strength.Shi Yan looked indifferent, he was unmoved by Zhua Qi\u2019s whispers.But Zuo Shi was not happy, she pouted and said, \u201cWhat are you muttering about, big earthworm? Who are you calling burdens? Hmph! If you don\u2019t wanna come along with us, then you can leave right now. It\u2019s not like we can\u2019t live without you.\u201d\u201cGirl, who are you calling earthworm?\u201d Zhua Qi\u2019s dark green scale-covered face slightly shook for a second, he murderously glared at Zuo Shi, \u201cSay that again!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Chi Xiao furrowed his brows, and scolded Zuo Shi, \u201cZhua Qi is an elder, don\u2019t be so disrespectful. We wouldn\u2019t have been travelling so smoothly this whole way if it weren\u2019t for Zhua Qi.\u201dChi Xiao then looked at Zhua Qi and said, \u201cWhy can\u2019t you stop being so foul-mouthed? If it weren\u2019t for your stupid foul mouth back in the day, I wouldn\u2019t have tried to fight to the death with you. Why are you doing it again?\u201dZhua Qi snorted and fiercely glared at Zuo Shi, the scales on his face shaking again, but he stopped mumbling.Zuo Shi however, wanted to keep throwing a few more insults at him, but was stopped by Chi Xiao\u2019s glare. She pouted her lips and stopped talking.Xia Xin Yan and the two giant men were on the left side of Chi Xiao and the rest of the group. She didn\u2019t talk, her expression was indifferent; she ignored Zhua Qi, but didn\u2019t have the intention to talk to Chi Xiao either.However, occasionally her eyes would drift towards Shi Yan. The expression in her eyes was quite complicated, and no one could figure out what she was really thinking.Since the day they came out from the swamp, she didn\u2019t speak a word to Shi Yan.Shi Yan was also sensible, he didn\u2019t make a move to get close to her either.This atmosphere between her and Shi Yan made Chi Xiao, Zuo Shi, and the rest dumbfounded. But everyone pretended they didn\u2019t realise, and nobody went to annoy and ask the two about it.\u201cJust come on and follow me. If you wanna live, you all better know your place!\u201d Zhua Qi snorted, and purposely looked towards Shi Yan.Shi Yan looked calm, he didn\u2019t bother with Zhua Qi.Just at this moment, Chi Xiao suddenly furrowed his brows, and a hint of confusion flashed in his eyes.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s expression moved, she keenly sensed Chi Xiao\u2019s abnormality.\u201cNothing.\u201d Chi Xiao shook his head, and said calmly, \u201cI just suddenly sensed something strange, but it was gone in a flash. I wonder if I\u2019m just being delusional.\u201dAfter saying that, everyone got a little nervous. Zhua Chi said, \u201cCould it be that Sky Realm master?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Chi Xiao shook his head again.\u201dChi Xiao\u2019s reaction cast a dark shadow over everyone\u2019s minds, and made everyone more cautious.\u2014In the Yin Field, where there was dense foliage filled with plants.A pale and tall middle-aged scholar silently stood there.By his side were thirty five warriors with the same pale face and blank expression. One of the young men was only in his early twenties. With long hair to his waist, he appeared very handsome, but had a kind of evil temperament.\u201cMaster, what have you found?\u201d The young man asked curiously.\u201cThe objectives should have entered into the Yin Field, and I just used my soul power to probe a little. Another soul power immediately sensed me.\u201d That pale middle-aged scholar said.\u201cIs it someone from the Beiming family?\u201d\u201cNo, Beiming Shang got here a long time ago.\u201d\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t he come to find us yet?\u201d\u201cThe objective is already here, Beiming Shang would come very soon.\u201d\u2014One day later.In the area where that group of people had gathered, Beiming Shang arrived there alone; cold energy writhing around his body.\u201cLord of the Dark World?\u201d After Beiming Shang arrived, he put together his fists for that middle-aged scholar, and said, \u201cHow may I address you?\u201d\u201cZou Zi He.\u201d The Lord of the Dark World looked calm, \u201cI\u2019ve long heard the name of the Head of the Beiming family. Now that I\u2019ve met you today, you seem to deserve your reputation.\u201dBeiming Shang stretched his lips, and said emotionlessly, \u201cBrother Zou, you should be one with the most wide-spread reputation. The Dark World has been dominant in the Fire Empire, and from that we can see that Brother Zou is truly a great talent in the world. Working with Brother Zou this time, hopefully everyone will be satisfied in the end.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s that girl from the Mu family?\u201d The Lord of the Dark World furrowed his brows.\u201cAfter exploring the Gate of Heaven, I will bring her to you myself.\u201d Beiming Shang glanced at everyone from the Dark World and said, \u201cBrother Zou, why have you brought so many? Aren\u2019t you scared of being discovered?\u201d\u201cWe, the people from the Dark World, are good at hiding our trails, this you don\u2019t have to worry about, Brother Beiming.\u201d\u201cAlright then.\u201d Beiming Shang nodded, then continued, \u201cThe other side has appeared, their target should be the Yin Valley in the Yin Field. If any mishaps really happen at that time, I wish Brother Zou would come out. But, I don\u2019t want you to identify yourself too soon, or else Mu Yi Die\u2019s resentment will grow.\u201d\u201cShe is merely a bereaved little girl, do you really need to care, Brother Beiming?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t really care about Mu Yu Die, but there\u2019s another girl by her side. The Martial Spirit that girl possesses could be of use to my Beiming family. I don\u2019t want that girl to know that we gave Mu Yu Die to you, or else it would affect my plans in the future.\u201d\u201cSure, the reason I didn\u2019t bring my mask this time, is to cooperate with you. I stand as the Lord of the Dark World, and I hardly show my true self to others. That Mu girl has never seen me, she will never know who I am. You can be reassured on this matter, Brother Beiming.\u201d\u201cGood, then we will meet again at the Yin Valley. By that time I will use my soul power to send messages to you, I hope you won\u2019t disappoint me, Brother Zou.\u201dThen Beiming Shang slowly retreated. His body faded into a wisp of cold energy, and dissipated into the air.\u201cMaster, Beiming Shang is cunning in his schemes. This exploration of the Gate of Heaven, we should be careful of him, he\u2019s definitely not the good kind.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, your mistress is here in the dark. If any great treasures really appear, they will surely belong to the Dark World!\u201d\u201cMistress is here too?\u201d The demonic handsome young man exclaimed.\u201cYes, she arrived at the Yin Valley a long time ago. With her attainments in concealment, no one in the Yin Field can ever detect her unless she shows herself!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHa, then this exploration of the Gate of Heaven is in the bag.\u201d\u201cMmm hmm.\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Translated by: AmyEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 87 \u2013 Black FormulaFollowing Zhua Qi and the others, Shi Yan headed for the Yin Valley without stopping.Zhua Qi proved his value along the way by removing those odd plants and brutal demon beasts.Zhua Qi turned out to be the co-master of the Dead Swamp, for he even knew this area, the Yin Field, far better than Chi Xiao.All along the way, Zhua Qi removed all the obstacles easily. In doing so, Chi Xiao and Xia Xin Yan could save their energy for the fight with the Nine-headed Sky Snake.The nearer they got to the Yin Valley, the more they could feel the Yin Qi.Gradually, Shi Yan could feel his Profound Qi flowing slower and slower; his ribs and bones were experiencing immense pressure from the Yin Qi.So did Zuo Shi.The nearer they came to the Yin Valley, the more pale her face became. Apparently, she wasn\u2019t able to adapt to the atmosphere there either.\u201cLet\u2019s have a rest here, Zhua Qi, Miss Xia, we need to study the treasure map as well.\u201d Chi Xiao was being considerate of his students, so he stopped at one clean and flat area and took out the treasure map to study with Zhua Qi and Xia Xin Yan.Zhua Qi didn\u2019t want to stop, but since Chi Xiao took out the map, he agreed with him instantly.He walked up to Chi Xiao quickly and giggled, \u201cI\u2019m very familiar with the Yin Valley. Let me see the map and I can find the position of the Gate of Heaven.\u201dXia Xin Yan hesitated and she too walked up.Chi Xiao had learnt the map by heart, so he handed the map to Xia Xin Yan and let her watch Zhua Qi, while he himself walked towards Zuo Shi and Shi Yan.\u201cHow do you two feel? Can you endure it?\u201d Chi Xiao looked to Zuo Shi.Zuo Shi\u2019s pretty face had turned pale, \u201cYes I can endure it, but it\u2019s too uncomfortable. The Yin Qi has slowed my Profound Qi and seems to be consuming it as well. The nearer we get to the Yin valley, the faster it is consumed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s natural.\u201d Chi Xiao nodded and explained, \u201cThe heavy Yin Qi would affect your body, so your Profound Qi would try to adapt to it, thus it gets consumed. You two pay attention to it. It\u2019s just the beginning. The Yin Qi will be denser in the valley, so if you two can\u2019t bear it you will have to stop before you enter it.\u201d\u201cTeacher, the [Basalt Scripture] seems to be able to remove some Yin Qi\u201d Zuo Shi suddenly said.Chi Xiao was surprised, finding it funny and annoying, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you train it long ago?\u201d\u201cI just realized it.\u201d Zuo Shi protruded her tongue and grinned naughtily, \u201cFine fine, I will train with it diligently from now on. I found that once I operate the [Basalt Scripture], the Yin Qi can\u2019t enter my body.\u201d\u201cIf you were hardworking long time ago, you might have finished training the [Basalt Scripture] already.\u201d Chi Xiao shook his head with regret and resignation.\u201cStop it! It\u2019s not too late to start now.\u201d Zuo Shi pouted with a grunt.Chi Xiao sighed in his mind and turned to Shi Yan, \u201cHow do you feel?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019m ok with it.\u201d Shi Yan replied calmly.\u201cWell, do your best.\u201d Chi Xiao nodded, \u201cYou should stop when you can\u2019t bear it, then Han Feng will stay and protect you, while Ku Long will enter the Yin Valley with us. We only need to find out what\u2019s inside the Gate of heaven this time, then your Shi family will send more experts here. So don\u2019t worry too much if you can\u2019t enter the Gate.\u201dShi Yan nodded, not saying anything more.Chi Xiao comforted him and requested Zuo Shi to work hard, then walked back to Zhua Qi and Xia Xin Yan.\u201cYoung Master, the family head told us that it\u2019s most important that you are safe. Don\u2019t push yourself if you can\u2019t bear it. The family head said that we just need to find out the exact position of the Gate and what\u2019s inside it.\u201d Ku Long said in a low voice beside him.\u201cI got it.\u201d Shi Yan looked indifferent, but his brows were furrowed.A short distance away, Zhua Qi, Xia Xin Yan and Chi Xiao were still studying the treasure map.Although Zhua Qi regarded himself as a know-it-all when it came to the Yin Valley, he couldn\u2019t figure out anything when he saw the map, as seen from his confused expression when whispering with Chi Xiao.Shi Yan glanced over them and sat down where he was, when a thought came across in his mind.He was curious about the Gate of Heaven, and he wanted to go inside of it too.However, the Yin Qi here was really tough, as it was omnipresent. At the same time, it was becoming more dense, which was affecting his body a lot.Before they got to the Yin Valley, he had to consume his Profound Qi to defend from its influence. He couldn\u2019t imagine how powerful the Yin Qi would be in the valley. By then, his Profound Qi would be totally consumed, and it would be very dangerous if anything came up.\u201cI must find a way to defend against the Yin Qi!\u201dAfter a short deliberation, Shi Yan\u2019s expression was determined. He sat cross-legged and tried to search in his memories.An idea flashed across his mind!The [Black Formula]!His face lit up. He picked up his bag and took out a book on the Mortal Level Martial Skill, [Black Formula].It was only an elementary level Martial Skill, which needed to collect Yin Qi while training. It was best to train with it where there was dense Yin Qi.Since he took the [Black Formula] from Karu he had given up training it as it was only a Mortal Level Martial Skill and required a Yin Qi-filled environment.After he got to the Shi family and witnessed so many Martial Skills, he had forgotten about the [Black Formula].Therefore, that book was buried in oblivion in that bag.The Yin Field here was heavy with Yin Qi, it was the best place to train in the [Black Formula]!Although the [Black Formula] was only a Mortal Level Martial Skill, since it required Yin Qi, once one was adapted to the environment, he could gather the Yin Qi and use it as a weapon.Shi Yan didn\u2019t care much about its power for as far as he was concerned, it was just a Mortal Level Martial Skill, which had limited power.Nonetheless, the [Black Formula] could absorb Yin Qi and help him adapt to it, which solved his problem for now!Therefore, he picked up that formula right away!While Chi Xiao, Zhua Qi and Xia Xin Yan were busy figuring out the position of the Gate of Heaven, Shi Yan devoted himself to the [Black Formula] and its practice process.Sitting on the ground, Shi Yan flipped open the book of the [Black Formula] with a solemn face.Before long, he had read through the first volume, and secretly put the book into his bag with his brows furrowed.Although the [Black Formula] was merely a Mortal Level Martial Skill, it appeared to be strange. To train with it, one must trigger the Yin Qi between the heaven and earth and form three Yin Swirls around the three meridians in one\u2019s chest: Tian Que, Shen Que and Yin Du.As long as the swirls are formed, one can trigger the [Black Formula] and absorb the Yin Qi around them easily.Once the three swirls absorbed enough Yin Qi, they would produce three Yin Pearls, which would go down the three meridians.And after that, the Yin Swirls could continue absorbing Yin Qi endlessly.As long as there was enough Yin Qi, the Yin Swirls would produce more Yin Pearls and submerge into the meridians.The more Yin pearls in the meridians, the more powerful the [Black Formula] would be.The one who trained with the [Black Formula] could collect Yin Qi by merely triggering the [Black Formula] and absorbing it into the three Yin Swirls.Although the [Black Formula] was merely a Mortal Level Martial Skill, no one knew how much Yin Qi it could absorb.It seemed that the three Yin Swirls would devour Yin Qi ceaselessly once there was enough Yin Qi.Shi Yan had seen many Martial Skills in the Martial Spirit Palace of the Shi family, but he had never seen anything as strange as this one.There was an end goal to train to with every Martial Skill, but the [Black Formula] could be trained endlessly.Sitting on the ground with a rigid face, Shi Yan sorted through the practice process he understood in order to train with the [Black Formula] and he found it literally extraordinary.However, he didn\u2019t hesitate at all. To enter the center of the Yin Valley, he memorised the practice process several times and began to train with it, while Chi Xiao and Zhua Qi were still whispering.Shi Yan connected his eyes, nose and heart, operated his will to Tian Que, Shen Que and Yin Du meridians and concentrated Yin Qi into them.During that process, his body was still under pressure, as his hadn\u2019t adapted to the Yin Qi yet.Gradually, the Yin Qi began to circle around the three meridians according to Shi Yan\u2019s will.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe found that his body was having a strange attraction to Yin Qi as he began to operate the [Black Formula].While he was refining his Yin Swirls, the Yin Qi around him began to gather and poured into his pores. At last, it arrived at the three meridians and started to spin slowly.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Translated by: QianEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everybody have a good rest. We will enter the Valley tomorrow morning.\u201d Zhua Qi stopped at the entrance of the Yin Valley and said with a gloomy expression, \u201cThe Nine-headed Sky Snake will notice us once we enter the Yin Valley; a fierce battle is unavoidable.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dChi Xiao took out the map again, and waved at Zhua Qi and Xia Xin Yan, \u201cLet\u2019s take this last night to study it again. It\u2019s best if we could find out the accurate position of the Gate of Heaven.\u201dZhua Qi and Xia Xin Yan walked up frowning, and looked down at the map.As usual, Shi Yan found a quiet place far away from those three people, sat down, and began to train with the [Black Formula].Every night during the past eight days, Chi Xiao would ask the group to stop and have a good rest, in order to provide Zuo Shi plenty of time to train with the [Basalt Scriptures].Shi Yan wasn\u2019t idle either. As soon as the group stopped, he would find a quiet place and train with the [Black Formula], under the protection of Han Feng and Ku Long.After eight days\u2019 practice, he had accumulated lots of Yin Qi in the three meridians in his chest. He operated the Yin Qi every day according to his will and divided it into several wisps to spin around the meridians.As the Yin Qi accumulated, it spun faster and faster, and was about to form into real Yin Swirls.After taking a deep breath and holding it, Shi Yan began to concentrate on controlling the Yin Qi.Wisps of Yin Qi began to intertwine at the three meridians in his chest, and under his control, was quickly forming into circles.Every time he reached this state, he would reach out to sense the Yin Qi in his surroundings; it was as if the Yin Qi was gathering around him under some magical force.After eight days\u2019 training in the [Black Formula], Shi Yan started getting hang of controlling the Yin Qi. At the same time, after several days\u2019 of revolution in the front of his chest, the Yin Qi in his body seemed to have changed slightly.The Yin Qi had become denser since they arrived at the entrance of the Yin Valley. However, Shi Yan found it quite comfortable thanks to the eight days\u2019 of training.Moreover, the nearer he approached the Yin Valley, the easier he was able to train the [Black Formula]. It was even rather refreshing to breathe the Yin Qi.Han Feng and Ku Long didn\u2019t exactly knew what Martial Skill Shi Yan was training in, but they were still protecting him diligently.Time flew by.All of a sudden, Zuo Shi, who was guarded by Wu Yun Lian and Chu Ping, jumped up joyfully with an odd light sparkling around her body. She shouted, \u201cHa! It\u2019s the Third Sky of the Human Realm!\u201dChi Xiao, who was focusing on the treasure map, rushed over in ecstasy, and as he grabbed Zuo Shi\u2019s hand and began to test her, his old face showing satisfaction, \u201cYou little girl, you are\u2026\u201dFrom the joyful reaction of Zuo Shi\u2019s Profound Qi, Chi Xiao could tell that she had reached the Third Sky of the Human Realm.Zuo Shi hadn\u2019t fully understood the [Basalt Scriptures] after eight days\u2019 of training, but she turned out to have reached the Third Sky of the Human Realm. For such talent there were not enough words for Chi Xiao to say anything.The only word he could come up with was: Genius.During their journey from the Cloud Mountain to Tianyun City, apart from fooling around, Zuo Shi hadn\u2019t trained hard for even a single day. It was out of his expectation that she entered that level so fast.\u201cMr. Chi Xiao, you\u2019ve got a really great student!\u201d Surprise also crossed Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes, as she too was shocked by Zuo Shi\u2019s talent.\u201cHehe, this girl is really talented, though she is too lazy.\u201d Chi Xiao was delightful as he patted Zuo Shi\u2019s shoulder, \u201cWork harder! Digest the [Basalt Scriptures] as soon as possible! You little girl, you could have reached a much higher realm had you focused on practice!\u201dThen he walked to Xia Xin Yan and Zhua Qi\u2019s side, and said with a smile, \u201cLeave that girl alone. Let\u2019s study the map.\u201d\u2014Another two hours passed.As Shi Yan was sitting there silently, suddenly his body shook heavily and then kept quivering slightly.More and more Yin Qi concentrated and combined in front of his chest as it spun faster and faster.Looking inside, he found the Profound Qi around his three meridians becoming stronger and spinning faster.The Profound Qi that he had absorbed rushed into the three meridians and then was refined and resolved into more gray strings.More and more gray strings gathered in the swirls inside the meridians, making the swirls spin faster and faster\u2026Not knowing how much time had passed, a gloomy air was suddenly forced out from the swirls, which shocked Shi Yan.More and more Yin Qi gathered from all directions and gushed into his pores heading for the centers of the three swirls, while they were spinning faster and faster.Looking inside, Shi Yan was shocked to find that the three swirls had formed a shadow and that shadow was emitting a strong attraction force.He had succeeded!The strong attraction force meant that a Yin Swirl had officially formed!Thus, the power of the Yin Swirl to devour Yin Qi was triggered!All of a sudden, the Yin Qi inside the Yin Field seemed to find an exit and flooded towards Shi Yan.Ten meters above Shi Yan\u2019s head, three odd swirls, as big as a human head, gradually appeared.Those swirls were similar to the Yin Swirls inside Shi Yan, and were apparently influenced by the Yin Swirls in his chest. They spun in line with his Yin Swirls and were attracting more Yin Qi to his location.Huge amounts of Yin Qi gushed into the three head-sized swirls above him which were expanding quickly!In merely ten minutes, those swirls had swollen to the size of a wash basin, and kept devouring Yin Qi from all directions.Chi Xiao, Zhua Qi, and Xia Xin Yan all stopped their discussion about the map and stood up, shocked by what they saw.The three swirls were still expanding!One hour later, the three swirls were like a tornado, extremely frightening.The swirls kept spinning crazily as they tried to devour all the Yin Qi in the Yin Valley!With a rigid face, Shi Yan sat there without moving, continuously operating the swirls inside him, seemingly not knowing about the phenomenon above his head.He could clearly feel that the three swirls in his chest had accelerated several times; even his mind found it hard to catch up with the spinning!Han Feng and Ku Long were taken aback as they watched this strange scene without any idea as to what was occurring.The dense gray Yin Qi had hovered in the Yin Field for thousands of years, isolating it from the sky, blocking both sunlight and moonlight.However today, the Yin Qi between the sky and the Yin Field all went crazy as it endlessly gushed into the swirls above Shi Yan.Not knowing when, the three swirls above his head had turned as huge as three mountains, filled with odd light. They looked like three huge mouths, ready to swallow all the Yin Qin between heaven and earth.\u201cThis, this is\u2026\u201d One huge man beside Xia Xin Yan cried suddenly, remembering something.\u201cWhat?\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes sparkled, and she turned to watch that huge man.Under Xia Xin Yan\u2019s gaze, that huge man hesitated, and then walked away quietly.Zhua Qi and Chi Xiao\u2019s expression changed as they watched the strange scene with incredible eyes. Noticing that the huge man had some new findings, they walked towards them.Xia Xin Yan frowned, walked away with the huge man and let him explain, keeping a distance from Zhua Qi and Chi Xiao.\u201cYou sure?\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s voice was filled with uncertainty.That huge man kept nodding his head, showing lots of anxiety, then he looked at Shi Yan in fear, \u201cI\u2019m very sure, it must be\u2026\u201dXia Xin Yan\u2019s face turned pale. She nodded and shouted to Chi Xiao and Zhua Qi, \u201cGet ready for the fight! The Nine-headed Sky Snake will come out soon. It needs Yin Qi to train with, so it will chase us at all expense! We don\u2019t need to enter the Yin Valley now.\u201d\u201cMiss Xia, our Young Master\u2026What the hell happened to him?\u201d Ku Long was rather anxious.\u201cAsk him when he wakes up.\u201d Xia Xin Yan frowned with bright light in her eyes, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry. That strange phenomenon will not affect him. On the contrary, it is an opportunity. He will suck the Yin Qi in the Yin Field clean if not disturbed.\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201dChi Xiao, Zhua Qi, Wu Yun Lian and Zuo Shi all screamed in astonishment, with unbelievable faces.\u201cYeah, this Martial Skill is this powerful. I don\u2019t know how he gained it.\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s expression was complex, \u201cThe Nine-headed Sky Snake will come soon, as it won\u2019t allow anyone to devour the Yin Qi. Maybe we don\u2019t even need to wait till tomorrow to fight it!\u201d\u201cHowl! Howl! Howl!\u201dFrom the Yin Valley, crazy hollows came with extraordinary rage.\u201cBang bang bang! Bang bang bang!\u201dMassive booms suddenly came from within the Yin Valley.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euEverybody shook with the earth, and they could feel that a huge monster was approaching them quickly.\u201cThere it is!\u201d Zhua Qi screamed.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Translated by: QianEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VIckPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Markandeye\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013The three swirls were floating above Shi Yan\u2019s head like giant clouds.Sparks flew inside the swirls and wisps of cold Yin Qi were repeatedly refined in the swirls, forming strange grey light spots.The air above the Yin Field was filled with natural Yin Qi and had remained as such for a long time. But the huge attraction from the three swirls was showing a pattern of rapid consumption, swallowing it to the last.Shi Yan\u2019s expression was serious, as if he had entered some enigmatic realm.The swirls above his head suddenly emitted some grey light spots, all of which entered Shi Yan\u2019s body.Because of that, Shi Yan\u2019s body started forming a vacuum which was felt by everyone present!His body was now like a black hole, sucking in all the grey light spots that came down from above!The grey light spots flickered and jumped and entered into Shi Yan\u2019s body.Shi Yan was now covered in a grey glow and a chilling atmosphere spread out from him in all directions.Whoever got near Shi Yan couldn\u2019t help but feel stiff. The circulation of their Profound Qi would slow down and they would have to use their Qi for defense or else they would be affected by the dense Yin Qi.It was like Shi Yan had transformed into a giant Yin Qi-swallowing monster!Shi Yan was sitting as still as a stone while the three swirls floating above his head were wildly swallowing and transforming the Yin Qi in the Yin Valley. He was continuously refining the Yin Qi, transforming it into purest form of Yin energy, which was in turn nurturing his cultivation.In Shi Yan\u2019s chest, the three meridians of Tian Que, Shen Que, and Yin Du started rapidly gathering the grey light spots that had rushed into his body.These grey light spots all represented the purest form of Profound Yin Qi. Huge amounts of light spots all entered the Yin Swirls and were refined to the purest degree. This refined energy then started gathering at the center of the Yin Swirls.Unknowingly, in the center of the three Yin Swirls, there were three rice grain sized pearls slowly starting to form.Once he detected the formation of the Yin Pearls, Shi Yan\u2019s expression shook.He discreetly started to detect his surroundings. When he realized there was nothing abnormal, he went back and continued circulating the Yin Swirls, ready to keep absorbing more of the natural Yin Qi.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to stop.\u201d Xia Xin Yan stood by Shi Yan\u2019s side, her beautiful eyes glinted, \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing, and I know you can hear me too. The Nine-headed Sky Snake will get here really soon, but we\u2019ll take care of that. You can keep swallowing the natural Yin Qi here.\u201dIndeed Shi Yan could hear Xia Xin Yan\u2019s voice, but he couldn\u2019t reply to her.\u201cMiss Xia, if Shi Yan doesn\u2019t stop here, the Nine-headed Sky Snake will attack him first.\u201d Ku Long said hurriedly.Zhua Qi and Chi Xiao also looked at Xia Xin Yan with a bit of surprise, not knowing what she meant by her proposal.\u201cThe Nine-headed Sky Snake has nine heads, three of which can breathe fire, three can spit poison, and the remaining three can control the Yin Qi in the Yin Field to attack differently.\u201dXia Xin Yan\u2019s pretty eyes glinted, and she explained in seriousness, \u201cThe three heads that can control the natural Yin Qi are very troublesome and they will be hard for us to take care of. But now we have an advantage. If Shi Yan keeps sucking in the natural Yin Qi like this, that means once the Nine-headed Sky Snake gets here, the Yin Qi attack will be swallowed by the swirls above Shi Yan\u2019s head! This way, three of the nine heads will be greatly weakened!\u201dUpon hearing that, Zhua Qi and Chi Xiao\u2019s eyes both glinted. Together they nodded and approved, \u201cNot bad!\u201d\u201cOnce those three heads become powerless, the Nine-headed Sky Snake will be a lot easier to deal with. Zhua Qi is not scared of the venom, and you also brought the Silver Curtain. So now we only need to put our efforts into the three fire-breathing heads. Because of Shi Yan, this fight is going to be a lot easier for us.\u201d Xia Xin Yan said calmly.Zhua Qi and Chi Xiao nodded quietly, they both agreed upon Xia Xin Yan\u2019s suggestion.\u201cWould my young master be okay?\u201d Han Feng suddenly opened his eyes and coldly stared at Xia Xin Yan, \u201cAlthough we are very interested in the Gate of Heaven, the young master\u2019s life is more important!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s only bait, he can just keep up what he\u2019s doing now.\u201d Xia Xin Yan frowned and continued, \u201cIf he wants to wake up he could do so anytime. But he will need a whole lot more time to try to gather the Yin Qi like this another time.\u201d\u201cBoom boom boom!\u201dThe thundering roar was getting closer.The earth was shaking and in the distance, a faint but frightening figure slowly started to appear.\u201cGet ready to fight!\u201d Chi Xiao shouted.\u2014At another entrance of the Yin Field.Beiming Shang\u2019s expression shook slightly. He looked far away into the distance at the smoke-like swirls that rose into the air. His cold eyes flashed with a trace of confusion.\u201cGrandpa, have they started fighting?\u201d Beiming Ce asked.Shaking his head, Beiming Shang said, \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that the natural Yin Qi has become abnormal. It is are all gathering towards where Chi Xiao and his group are at. The Nine-headed Sky Snake is out of the Yin Valley and is rushing towards them. I wonder what is going on over there.\u201d\u201cWhen should we get there?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s wait! Wait until the fighting is almost over.\u201d\u2014On another side, the people from the Dark World were gazing at the three floating swirls where Shi Yan was. They were also full of surprise, and didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201cMaster? It\u2019s like\u2026 like the natural Yin Qi has changed and is all gathering towards that one spot? Could it be that the Nine-headed Sky Snake has already started to attack?\u201d The demonic young man guessed.\u201cThe Nine-headed Sky Snake is able to use the natural Yin Qi to cultivate, but it shouldn\u2019t be this overbearing. To make all of that natural Yin Qi flow towards one spot I think even the Nine-headed Sky Snake would be unable to make such a grand gesture. Besides, the change is from outside the Yin Valley, it\u2019s obviously done By Chi Xiao\u2019s group.\u201d The Lord of the Dark World said with a deep tone.\u201cShould we go and see it?\u201d\u201cNo, we will wait for Beiming Shang\u2019s news. If Beiming Shang doesn\u2019t give out the signal, we will stay put for now. Your mistress should already be there, so if the Gate of Heaven really appears, your mistress will send out a signal, we don\u2019t need to be in such a hurry.\u201d\u201cUnderstood.\u201d\u2014The three Yin Pearls were slowly forming. With more natural Yin Qi flowing in, the three Yin pearls grew brighter and brighter.The Yin pearls were in the middle of the Yin Swirls outside of Shi Yan\u2019s meridians. They were rolling in the air and whenever a wisp of grey Yin Qi came in, the Yin Pearls would immediately absorb the grey light spots.Only when the Yin Pearls were truly formed would they finally sink into the three meridians by themselves.Shi Yan knew this deep in his heart. So when he clearly heard Xia Xin Yan\u2019s words, and knew that Han Feng and Ku Long were very worried about him, he still didn\u2019t stop the movement of the Yin Swirls.He had a hunch that the Yin Pearls were at their crucial moment, and perhaps they will soon be truly formed successfully and then enter into his meridians.When the three swirls showed up above his head, he was shocked too.When the three swirls started insanely swallowing the natural Yin Qi, Shi Yan was finally sure that the [Black Formula] that was only ranked as a Mortal Level Martial Skill, was not something ordinary!What kind of Mortal Level Martial Skill could cause such a big disturbance?He really couldn\u2019t think of any.\u201cRoar! Roar! Roar!\u201dTerrifying roaring sounds thundered from the distance and filled the whole Yin Field.The Nine-headed Sky Snake was a demon beast which was at the pinnacle of Level 7. Legend has it that it was an ancient mutant, a hybrid born from a dragon and a python. It has the ability to keep evolving, so when the Nine-headed Sky Snake has swallowed enough Yin Qi, poisonous air, and fire, it could evolve again and become a Level 8 or Level 9 demon beast.The reason why this Nine-headed Sky Snake decided to take over the Yin Field was because it had seen that this place was rich in Yin Qi, and the outer perimeter of the Dead Swamp was covered by poisonous fog. It wanted to occupy this place so that it could use the poisonous air and the Yin Qi present for cultivation.Soon a mountain-like figure, the Sky Snake with nine giant heads, finally came out of the Yin Valley.The Nine-headed Sky Snake had a body like a mountain, covered with silver scales and sharp spines. All nine of its heads were about twenty-something meters long. Each head was like a giant python and had creepy white fangs, each head was breathing out either poisonous fog, Yin Qi, or flames.\u201cAttack!\u201dOnce Zhua Qi saw it, his face hardened and he charged ahead of others.Earth Dragons abruptly broke out of the ground. Zhua Qi\u2019s body flickered and he possessed one of the Earth Dragon\u2019s bodies.When Zhua Qi possessed the Earth Dragon, its body covered itself in hard earth armor. The dragon head faintly looked like Zhua Qi\u2019s face and its body grew twice the size.\u201cZhua Qi was born from a Level 8 Mud Dragon and a human female warrior. The Mud Dragon was originally the true master of the Dead Swamp and was able to transform into human shape. It was also once the strongest demon beast in this area. Legend has it that back then, the Mud Dragon was the king of the demon beasts here and not a single warrior could offend his prestige! The Mud Dragon was a Level 8 demon beast, comparable to a Spirit Realm warrior. But a thousand years ago it suddenly died in the Dead Swamp, it was a baffling death. Many years after its death, the Nine-headed Snake finally appeared in the Dead Swamp, and drove Zhua Qi to the outer perimeter of the Dead Swamp. It forcibly occupied the Yin Valley to cultivate, which is why Zhua Qi has so much hatred for it.\u201dWhen Zhua Qi possessed the Earth Dragon and charged at the Nine-headed Sky Snake, Chi Xiao quietly told about the grudge between Zhua Qi and the Nine-headed Sky Snake.\u201cLevel 8 demon beast!\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s expression also shifted slightly, \u201cNo wonder Zhua Qi can control the poisonous mist and also freely travel through the mud. So he\u2019s a hybrid between a Mud Dragon and a human.\u201d\u201cIf he didn\u2019t know how to control the poisonous mist and the mud, he would\u2019ve been killed by the Nine-headed Snake a long time ago. At the outer perimeter of the Dead Swamp, as long as Zhua Qi could hide in the swamps, nobody can do anything to him. That\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s so tough to handle Zhua Qi.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou two! Can you start fighting now?!\u201dOn the other side, Zhua Qi was in the form of an Earth Dragon, and he yelled from inside the flames that were breathed out by the Nine-headed Snake, he sounded a little urgent.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Translated by: AmyEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was single-handedly facing the three fire-breathing heads of the Nine-headed Sky Snake.Zhua Qi had possessed an Earth Dragon and was veering around the three venomous heads of the Nine-headed Sky Snake. The Sky Snake seemed to know that its venom was ineffective against Zhua Qi, so it opened its enormous mouth and bit down on Zhua Qi\u2019s possessed Earth Dragon.Xia Xin Yan was faring the best of the three. She floated in the air like a goddess, forming strange seals with her hands. Huge claws would momentarily appear in the air, which would ruthlessly attack the rest of the heads of the Nine-headed Sky Snake.These three heads of the Sky Snake could control the natural Yin Qi, but whenever it breathed out the Yin Qi, they would be immediately absorbed by the three hovering swirls above Shi Yan\u2019s head.After a few futile attempts, the Sky Snake became furious. It moved toward Shi Yan and repeatedly tried to clash with him. It was determined to kill Shi Yan first.Han Feng and Ku Long were observing everything gravely. Though being uneasy, they stood beside Shi Yan and were constantly on guard.Zuo Shi, Wu Yun Lian and Chu Ping soon arrived at that stop. Now all the members from the Shi family and Zuo family had gathered together, and other than Shi Yan, all were watching the fight between the Nine-headed Sky Snake and the three masters.Shi Yan was sitting still as a stone, his eyes closed and expression indifferent. However, he could clearly feel the striking waves of devastating power.The fight among the Sky Realm masters destroyed all the vegetation around the Yin Valley. In one place, a deep crack had formed on the ground during the battle. Even Shi Yan, who was sitting with eyes closed, could feel the terrifying impacts.However, he still didn\u2019t stop the Yin Swirls from taking in the natural Yin Qi.In his chest, the Yin Swirls finally turned into Yin Pearls. They emitted a dark glow and contained overwhelming Yin Qi. These pearls slowly sunk into the three meridians of Shen Que, Tian Que, and Yin Du.Once the three Yin Pearls sunk into his meridians, Shi Yan\u2019s body trembled.Checking inside his body, Shi Yan realized that when the Yin Pearls entered in the meridians, the negative energies already present in the meridians all rushed towards the Yin Pearls, as if it was assimilating into the Yin Pearls.Shi Yan was startled. He hurriedly concentrated his all in observing his three meridians.He suddenly remembered that all his meridians had some amount of negative energy. He really didn\u2019t expect that these negative energies would conflict with the emerging Yin Pearls.Inside the three meridians.Wisps of negative energy formed into ribbon-like shapes and slowly gathered together.Once the three Yin Pearls entered his meridians, the negative energies immediately intertwined with them, as if they were actually trying to break down the Yin Pearls.However, the Yin Pearls had condensed massive amounts of natural Yin Qi and had formed after continuous and repeated refinement! Although the negative energies in his meridians were domineeringly wicked, they still lacked in quantity.Over the course of these days, Shi Yan had indeed absorbed a lot of negative energy, but the negative energies were spread throughout the meridians in his body.There were seven hundred and twenty meridians in total in his body, and of course the negative energy distributed to these three meridians was limited.However, it was as if the Yin Pearls knew the lethality of the negative energy, and were determined to defend against it. It was like the Yin Pearls were going all out till the end.Soon the negative energy and the Yin Pearls in his body stopped blindly battling each other.With more and more Yin Qi pouring into the Yin Swirls, three more new Yin Pearls started forming in the center of the Yin Swirls\u2026This way, the previous three Yin Pearls that had already sunk into his meridians gained strong support. The Yin Pearls slowly gained dominance within Shi Yan\u2019s meridians.On the contrary, it was those domineering negative energies that had to shrink back into the corner of his meridians and stop causing trouble; they couldn\u2019t gain support.Over Shi Yan\u2019s head, the three mountainous Yin Swirls continued to rapidly absorb the natural Yin Qi.The Yin Field that never sees the light all year round, was suddenly struck with its first beam of sunlight!Under the crazy suction of the three mountainous swirls above Shi Yan\u2019s head, the Yin Qi that had gathered for thousands of years and covered the air in the Yin Field, was on the verge of being totally dried up!The cold and gloomy Yin Field slowly became warmer because of the influx of sunlight.More sunlight shone from above, and the beams of sunlight shot onto the plants and demon beasts in the Yin Field.The strange bizarre plants soon became limp and shrivelled up under the blazing sun.Many demon beasts were roaring in madness. They sprinted out of the Yin Field, and unwittingly rushed towards the outer perimeter of the Dead Swamp.\u201cHey!\u201d Zuo Shi exclaimed, \u201cThese plants and demon beasts are scared of sunlight?\u201d\u201cThe plants in the Yin Field grow from the natural Yin Qi, they\u2019ve already adapted to the environment here. But now that the natural Yin Qi is gone, these plants that have never been in contact with sunlight can\u2019t tolerate it. They are all going to wither and die.\u201d Wu Yun Lian explained.\u201cWhat about the demon beasts?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re the same. The demon beasts that live here cultivate by absorbing the Yin Qi. There is a heavy amount of Yin Qi in their bodies, they naturally like the cool shade. So once they realized that sunlight has appeared, they could only sprint away to escape into the swamps in the outer areas. At least there are poisonous fogs and the shade of old trees to cover them. It\u2019s better than being completely exposed to the sun like this.\u201d\u201cDoes that mean the Nine-headed Sky Snake is affected too?\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d Wu Yun Lian was dazed for a second, and she gazed at the Nine-headed Sky Snake.Sure enough.Under the blazing sun, the three heads of the Nine-headed Sky Snake that breathed Yin Qi seemed to be getting weaker.Under Xia Xin Yan\u2019s attacks with the giant hands, those three heads could only dodge, possessing no power to fight back.The two tall buff men who were worriedly watching Xia Xin Yan, at this moment, finally breathed out in relief.One of them looked back and gazed afar at Shi Yan, he frowned and quietly said, \u201cThanks to that guy, if it weren\u2019t for him absorbing all that natural Yin Qi like this and exposing sunlight in the Yin Field, the Nine-headed Sky Snake would really be hard to handle.\u201d\u201cMmmhmm, it surprised me that the [Black Formula] would spread to here, I wonder where he got such a thing\u2026\u201d\u201cBoom boom boom! Boom boom boom!\u201d The Nine-headed Snake stumbled along the way, and suddenly sprinted towards the Yin Valley.The sun had appeared and the Nine-headed Sky Snake\u2019s body was heavily damaged. It actually started thinking about running for its life.\u201cChase it!\u201dZhua Qi cried out, he ran ahead first, staring at the Nine-headed Sky Snake, and pursued it vigorously.Chi Xiao and Xia Xin Yan exchanged eye contact, they both knew that the Gate of Heaven was in the Yin Valley. If they gave the Nine-headed Sky Snake enough time to rest it would become more troublesome later on.Instead, they might as well destroy it as soon as possible!So, Chi Xiao and Xia Xin Yan also followed.Thundering roars kept coming from inside the Yin Valley. Chi Xiao and the rest should still be batting the Nine-headed Sky Snake in the Valley.Outside the Valley, the three giant swirls above Shi Yan\u2019s head slowly disappeared.All the natural Yin Qi that filled the enormous Yin Field had been emptied.In Shi Yan\u2019s chest, three new Yin Pears were successfully formed, and together they sank into his meridians.Feeling that the Yin Swirls had stopped whirling, and not a single trace of Yin Qi was flowing into his body, he finally woke up.Shi Yan opened his eyes and stood up. He looked around at the surprised Han Feng, Wu Yun Lian, and the rest, then said, \u201cLet\u2019s go look in the Yin Valley, it sounds like the Nine-headed Sky Snake is almost finished.\u201dAs expected, when everyone listened, they realized that the stirring in the Yin Valley had started to die out.\u201cYoung Master, how are you doing?\u201d Ku Long couldn\u2019t help but ask.\u201cI\u2019m alright, I was cultivating a new skill. I just didn\u2019t expect this skill to be so strange.\u201d Shi Yan furrowed his brows, he suddenly thought of something, and tried to circulate the three Yin Swirls at his chest.Wisps of strange Yin power suddenly flowed out from the three meridians of Shen Que, Tian Que, and Yin Du. The Yin power poured into the Yin Swirls, and the Yin Swirls began to quickly whirl, releasing traces of pure Yin power.Yin power was different than Profound Qi, but it went along his arm and flowed out\u2026In his palm, a chilling glow shone, and a dark green light ball slowly covered his whole hand.As his Yin power stirred, the light ball became bigger and bigger, and eventually it became a head-sized green light ball.Lightly taking a breath in, Shi Yan\u2019s reversed the action. That green light ball started shrinking again, and all the Yin power returned through its original course and returned to the Yin Swirls and was again absorbed by the six Yin Pearls in his meridians.The Yin Pearls were the source of power of the [Black Formula]. They released power through the Yin Swirls and then flew out of his meridians to attack.Secretly feeling around for a moment, Shi Yan soon realized the way to use the [Black Formula]. It\u2019s not the same as swallowing in Yin Qi, but the other way around.\u201cBeiming Shang! What are you doing here?!\u201dRight at this moment, from the Yin Valley there suddenly came Chi Xiao\u2019s surprised shout.Everyone outside the valley suddenly felt something amiss.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cQuickly let\u2019s go and see!\u201d Wu Yun Lian notified the rest, and hurriedly rushed towards the direction of the Yin Valley.Shi Yan, Han Feng, and Ku Long couldn\u2019t treat this lightly either, so together they quickly sprinted out and ran towards the Yin Valley with great speed.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Translated by: AmyEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

As soon as Shi Yan saw the scene in the valley, his face turned gloomy.Beiming Ce and Beiming Shang were standing there.Yin Kui and Jiu Shan were naturally standing by Beiming Ce. Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan were excited to see the Nine-headed Sky Snake lying in its own in blood.Beside the experts of the Beiming Family, stood Zou Zi He and a strange young man.All the people in the valley were focusing their eyes on the Nine-headed Sky Snake in the center.Chi Xiao and Zhua Qi appeared tired, with sweat all over their bodies.Xia Xin Yan looked pale. Although she had taken a Sky Pill, her energy had not fully recovered.The three had tried everything and used up all their energy in killing the Nine-headed Sky Snake, only to find that Beiming Shang and another Sky Realm expert had appeared in the Yin Valley secretly.It was easy to understand their frustration.After Shi Yan entered the valley, he stood beside Han Feng and Ku Long, calmly gazing at Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan, who were quite excited.\u201cEveryone can have the treasure from the Nine-headed Sky Snake carcass. This Sky Snake has nine demon crystals; how about we divide it among ourselves?\u201d Beiming Shang frowned and said calmly, \u201cYou three really suffered a lot, so I won\u2019t ask for much. I only need two demon crystals out of nine. One of the fire element, and the other of Yin Qi.\u201d\u201cWhy on earth should you have a share?\u201d Zhua Qi\u2019s face was twisted as he demanded with a hideous expression, \u201cAll the demon crystals of the Nine-headed Sky Snake belong to us! We brought out our all to kill this Snake, and now you want us to share the booty with you? Why should we?!\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d Beiming Shang said coldly, \u201cBecause we are here!\u201d\u201cI want a cut also.\u201d The Dark Master of the Dark World said peacefully as he pointed to one of the snake heads which could emit Yin Qi, \u201cThe demon crystal in that head is mine. The rest are all yours.\u201d\u201cHehe!\u201d Zhua Qi showed a grim smile, \u201cYou have to first make sure you are capable of getting it!\u201d\u201cCapable or not, you must know it better than me.\u201d The Dark Master looked at Zhua Qi and said peacefully, \u201cWe tested each other at the perimeter of the Dead Swamp and you killed several of my people. However, that was in the outer area where you could use the swamp and poisonous air as your shield. What about here?\u201d\u201cBrother Zou.\u201d Beiming Shang looked to the Dark Master and grinned, \u201cThere seemed to be three Sky Realm warriors, but that\u2019s not the exact situation.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cMiss Xia\u2019s Martial Spirit is marvellous, but she is a mere Disaster Realm Third Sky warrior.\u201d Beiming Shang pointed to Xia Xin Yan, \u201cShe won\u2019t recover in a short time since she has used her Martial Spirit. We don\u2019t need to worry about her.\u201dXia Xin Yan\u2019s face turned pale after she heard that.Zhua Qi\u2019s expression was also changed, and he couldn\u2019t help but looked to her, \u201cIs that so?\u201dAs far as he was concerned, although he and Chi Xiao had consumed much energy, they could still make them give up the demon crystals as long as they received Xia Xin Yan\u2019s help.However, if Xia Xin Yan was only at the Third Sky of the Disaster Realm, then they would definitely lose.Under Zhua Qi\u2019s gaze, Xia Xin Yan nodded in resignation.\u201cBeiming Shang, why on earth are you here?\u201d Chi Xia had some other concerns. He thought for a while and asked.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Beiming Shang asked with a grin.\u201cI got it.\u201d Chi Xiao sighed and nodded, \u201cYou have come for the Gate of Heaven, haven\u2019t you? It seems you never let go of the treasure map.\u201d\u201cOur sources in the Tianyun City are far greater than you can imagine. Nothing would go unnoticed if I care to know.\u201d Beiming Shang walked over slowly to one of the snake heads, and continued calmly, \u201cLet\u2019s divide the demon crystals first, then we will have a discussion about the Gate of Heaven.\u201dUnder the watchful eyes of the people present, Beiming Shang took out a demon crystal and said, \u201cI want this one.\u201dThe Dark Master from the Dark World didn\u2019t move, and he demanded casually, \u201cMu Hui, get the demon crystals.\u201dThat exotic young man nodded with a smile and walked to the two snake heads, without minding Chi Xiao and the rest, knowing they dare not fight.Zhua Qi was in a rage, with his face as red as a tomato, but he stood there and clenched his teeth, \u201cI will remember you two!\u201dBeiming Shang and Dark Master didn\u2019t respond.\u201cZhua Qi, gouge the remaining five demon crystals.\u201d Chi Xiao sighed with resignation.Zhua Qi also went up to the snake body.While searching for the demon crystal in the snake heads, Zhua Qi seemed to try to release his indignation by acting in a rough manner, as blood and flesh flew out from those snake heads.Shi Yan was observing them coldly.Beiming Shang and Zou Zi He apparently had planned all this and were waiting for the best opportunity.Beiming Shang showed up while Chi Xiao and his friends were about to kill the snake and took advantage of Xia Xin Yan using her Reincarnation Martial Spirit to ask for a share of the plunder.That was really malicious.He conserved his energy by not doing anything, and by forcing Chi Xiao and the other two to consume their energy, he shared the plunder.Once the Gate of Heaven was opened, he would get more chances to gain treasures than them with his energy at its peak.Shi Yan took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He didn\u2019t say anything but observed the new groups while they were dividing the plunder.Before long, the plunder was divided.Of the nine demon crystals, the Beiming family got a fire crystal, and a Yin Qi one, while Zou Zi He got the other two Yin Qi demon crystals.Of the remaining five, Zhua Qi got two poisonous ones and Chi Xiao got another poisonous crystal and a fire elementary one.Xia Xin Yan also received a fire elementary one.The nine demon crystals were thus divided among the experts present.Later, the tusks, skin and saliva from the Snake was also harvested by the group.Since there were several Sky Realm warriors, those rare materials like tusks were soon collected and divided.This time, the Shi family got five poisonous tusks, a piece of skin from the back of the snake, and three bottles of poison.\u201cThis demon crystal of fire element is beneficial to your Martial Spirit.\u201d Beiming Shang threw his hand casually and a demon crystal flew slowly to Di Yalan.Di Yalan was rather surprised as she looked at Beiming Shang with uncertainty, and asked excitedly, \u201cBei\u2026 Beiming Family Head, you mean, you mean this demon crystal is for me?\u201dThe fire element demon crystal was indeed beneficial to Di Yalan\u2019s Blue Magic Flame, and it was from a Level 7 demon beast, which was very rare to her.Beiming Shang nodded with a beaming smile, \u201cCome, train hard with the help of this demon crystal. I won\u2019t treat you unfairly as long as you are in my family.\u201dDi Yalan was hesitant as she thought that the demon crystal was too precious. She was too shy to take the crystal, which was floating before her eyes.\u201cHere you are, Sister Lan. Put it away.\u201d Just then, Mu Yu Die grabbed the demon crystal and handed it to Di Yalan.\u201cThank you, Beiming Family Head.\u201d As soon as she touched the crystal, she could feel the strong flame power emitting from it. Di Yalan didn\u2019t hesitate anymore, and paid her gratitude to Beiming Shang quickly.\u201cWe are family. You don\u2019t need to say that.\u201d Beiming Shang said indifferently.Di Yalan was a little panicked as she understood the overtone of Beiming Shang. But still, she lowered her head and pretended she didn\u2019t get what he meant, holding the demon crystal tight.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe couldn\u2019t resist the temptation of the demon crystal.Shi Yan saw the whole thing, but he kept silent with a rigid face.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Translated by: QianEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was standing there and thinking deeply. He glanced first at Xia Xin Yan, then at Zhua Qi, and felt a bit hesitant.Xia Xin Yan was slowly recovering after taking a Nutrition Pill. But she was still far away from being completely recovered.At this moment, the opposite side had two Sky Realm warriors. However, with Chi Xiao and Zhua Qi at only at eighty percent strength, it was predetermined that they would be at a disadvantage.\u201cLet\u2019s take it out and have a look together, we haven\u2019t been able to find the Gate of Heaven anyway.\u201d Xia Xin Yan said in an indifferent and relaxed manner.\u201cMiss Xia Xin Yan knows about onset and retreat, truly you are someone who can achieve great things.\u201d Beiming Shang nodded, and then told Xia Xin Yan with a straight face, \u201cMiss Zia, the Beiming family has only come for the treasure map, we don\u2019t want to make enemies with the Misty Pavilion. After this, no matter what the outcome, the Beiming family will never bother the Misty Pavilion even a bit.\u201dXia Xin Yan was from the Endless Sea, and with just being at the Third Sky of the Disaster Realm, she could utilise her martial spirit to immediately reach the Sky Realm! This little girl was already this powerful, how powerful would her background would be?Beiming Shang held a lot of fear towards warriors from the Endless Sea. If not as a last resort, he didn\u2019t want to have a hostile relationship with Xia Xin Yan.\u201cI also came for the treasure map.\u201d Not a single trace of emotion could be seen on Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes as she spoke, \u201cAfter the business with the treasure map is finished, we will return to the Endless Sea. As long as the Misty Pavilion is not provoked, we from the Endless Sea wouldn\u2019t bother to come to such a remote area.\u201d\u201cThat would be for the best.\u201d Beiming Shang said.\u201cI\u2019ll warn you beforehand though, even if there may be incredible treasure in the Gate of Heaven, it will also be infested with unimaginable dangers!\u201d Xia Xin Yan hesitated for a moment, then said, \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been an appearance of the Gate of Heaven in your area, so your understanding of the Gate is only limited to rumors, you may be aware of only one side of the coin, and not the other.\u201d\u201cAny further details would be appreciated.\u201dWhether it be Beiming Shang or Zou Zi He from the Dark World, they both zoned out for a second, then looked at Xia Xin Yan with serious expressions.Indeed, in the God Blessed Empire, the Fire Empire, and the Merchant Union, the legend of the Gate of Heaven had spread. However, there had never been an appearance of the Gate of Heaven in these three nations, which is why when this treasure map appeared, it attracted the attention of so many forces.Chi Xiao, Zhua Qi, and Han Feng also expectantly looked at Xia Xin Yan. They were also full of curiosity about the secrets to the Gate of Heaven.\u201cIn the Endless Sea, not only does the Gate of Heaven exist, but there\u2019s more than one! But, every Gate of Heaven bears the greatest dangers!\u201dXia Xin Yan took a deep breath; there was a rare seriousness in her expression. She said with a deep voice, \u201cThe Gate of Heaven leads to the God Domain. The God Domain contains unimaginable mysteries, but every God Domain is also extremely frightening! Usually when a warrior enters, there\u2019s a very low chance of coming back alive! Whether it be the Fourth Demon Area, the Sevenfold Underworld, or the Abyss Battlefield, none of them could be entered by ordinary people!\u201d\u201cFourth Demon Area!\u201d\u201cSevenfold Underworld!\u201d\u201cAbyss Battlefield!\u201dComing from Xia Xin Yan\u2019s mouth, the names related to the Gate of Heaven and the God Domain of the Endless Sea made everyone present in the Valley astonished; they secretly felt stunned.\u201cI came this time only to see what mysterious God Domain this Gate of Heaven leads to. Unknown domains could lead to terrifying and mysterious places that may devour everything. You better get prepared beforehand!\u201d Xia Xin Yan looked around and said coldly, \u201cInside the God Domains that have appeared in the Endless Sea, there were powerful beings that were as powerful as the Spirit Realm. And there were more than one of them! If there are such beings in this God Domain too, and you all want to rashly break in, hmph! Don\u2019t expect to come out alive!\u201dXia Xin Yan\u2019s words raised a storm of shock in everyone\u2019s minds.Whether it be Beiming Shang, Zou Zi He, Chi Xiao, or Zhua Qi, they were all suddenly stunned, their expressions aghast.Spirit Realm beings? And more than one!What kind of concept was this?If the God Domain accessed from this Gate of Heaven also has a being of this of level, who in this whole valley can say that they will get out alive?The entire valley was silent.\u201cWhat, are you all afraid?\u201d Xia Xin Yan sneered.\u201cNo matter what, I still have to go in and take a look.\u201d Zou Zi He\u2019s lips were a bit dry, but after a long silence, he then said, \u201cOr else, how would we know what\u2019s inside? Miss Xia is only at the Third Sky of the Disaster Realm and still dares to come, what are we afraid of?\u201dWhen Zou Zi He put it that way, everyone finally realized.Xia Xin Yan came this time obviously because she wanted to enter the God Domain too. She knew the dangers of the God Domain, but still dared to come, was it that she really came to die?Thinking this way, everyone all felt that Xia Xin Yan was only scaring them. Maybe the God Domain wasn\u2019t even that dangerous.\u201cI have said what needed to be said, you guys can figure it out yourselves.\u201d Xia Xin Yan nodded at Chi Xiao, \u201cYou can take out the treasure map now.\u201dChi Xiao knew that it would be hard to avoid Beiming Shang and Zou Zi He, so with frustration, he could only take the treasure map out from his chest pocket.Beiming Shang and Zou Zi He hurriedly moved closer, and gathered around the treasure map to examine it.\u201cThe treasure map only marked one point in the Yin Valley, which is pointing to this place here, but there\u2019s nothing there.\u201d Zhua Qi scowled, and said coldly, \u201cI\u2019ve gone around many times in the valley before and even used my soul perception to scan the movements underground. But there\u2019s nothing at all, is this treasure map fake?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t be fake.\u201d Xia Xin Yan said with certainty, but she did not explain.Everyone knew that she came from the Endless Sea and her understanding of the Gate of Heaven and the God Domain was above their own. Upon hearing her say that, everyone immediately stopped worrying, and they all stared intensely at that treasure map. Each one was in deep thoughts, and paced around in the Yin Valley, as if trying to figure out the location of the Gate of Heaven.Shi Yan was standing with Han Feng and Ku Long; he didn\u2019t get mixed into the business. He just coldly observed these people\u2019s reactions, and occasionally glanced at Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan.Mu Yu Die and Beiming Ce stood together. Sometimes they would both chat and laugh quietly about something, and sometimes Mu Yu Die would simply press her lips and smile.Di Yalan was still drowning in happiness, her hands tightly gripping the fire demon crystal and her face full of excitement. The look on her face was clearly showing her impatience to start absorbing the energy in the demon crystal then and there, so that she could nourish her Martial Spirit right away.Time passed quickly.All the Sky Realm masters in the valley looked worried. They frowned and pondered about the secrets of the treasure map, but no one could figure out the location of the Gate of Heaven.Soon, the day passed and it was night time.Twinkling bright stars appeared in the darkness.Slowly, more stars appeared in the night sky\u2026And finally, an array of stars filled the entire night sky.Suddenly, the treasure map clutched in Zhua Qi\u2019s hand started to light up!Everyone\u2019s faces changed, and their eyes immediately went to the treasure map.The treasure map escaped Zhua Qi\u2019s hold. It slowly rose in the sky, higher and higher, and very soon it was floating in the sky above the Yin Valley.A mass of strange power suddenly rippled from inside the treasure map!The light of the stars seem to have been drawn in by the power of the map. Like raindrops, the bright starlight suddenly poured down from the sky and onto the treasure map.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe treasure map suddenly blew to pieces and a fist-sized clear demon crystal abruptly appeared out of thin air!A strange power filled the whole Yin Valley, and the demon crystal gleamed with light, clear and bright as a quartz.Inside the demon crystal was a sluggish-looking little person, his body glowed with light, and his expression extremely miserable.\u201cFather!\u201dZhua Qi suddenly screamed. He unbelievably looked at the little person inside the demon crystal, and roared, \u201cFather! I am Zhua Qi! Father!\u201d\u201cThe demon crystal of the Level 8 Mud Dragon!\u201dChi Xiao also exclaimed, his expression in awe.In the valley, one by one the warriors raised their heads to look up at the sky. They all looked appalled, not knowing what happened.The little person inside the demon crystal didn\u2019t seem to hear Zhua Qi\u2019s voice, it stayed in the demon crystal looking dazed.The Level 8 demon crystal became brighter and brighter, and a strange mass of power suddenly rippled out from it.\u201cAh!\u201dDi Yalan exclaimed, and sweetly shouted, \u201cMy demon crystal!\u201dThe Nine-headed Sky Snake demon crystal that was tightly clenched in her hand suddenly flew up, and rose to the sky.At the same time, the eight newly acquired demon crystals held by Beiming Shang, Zou Zi He, Chi Xiao, Zhua Qi, and Xia Xin Yan, all escaped from their grasp. One by one they soared into the sky, revolving around the Level 8 demon crystal that contained the spirit of the Mud Dragon.Colorful strange lights shone from the ten demon crystals in the sky, and brightened the whole Yin Valley.In the valley, the snake blood that bled from the Nine-headed Sky Snake moved as if it was alive, forming into a river of blood that flowed inside the valley.The bloody river was like a mysterious paint brush.With its metallic odor, the blood separated into different flows, and like a blood snake, it swiftly moved across the ground of the valley.Soon, with the blood of the Nine-headed Sky Snake as the catalyst, a strange pattern drawn by blood magically appeared on the ground.\u201cBoom boom boom! Boom boom boom! Boom boom boom! Boom!\u201dThe ten demon crystals in the sky exploded together, forming into ten beams of light, and suddenly drew into the strange pattern on the ground.The galaxy-like strange pattern abruptly flashed strange lights. The starlight from the night sky came down from the sky, and also infused into the pattern.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIn the middle of the great galaxy-like pattern, strange lights quickly gathered together, thousands of light spots condensed together, and slowly formed into a blindingly bright door of light.The Gate of Heaven had appeared!\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Translated by: AmyEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Those black spots, as seen under the moonlight, gathered together and flew in the direction of the Misty Pavilion.Many skilled warriors looked up, only to find that these black dots were in actual some strange demon beasts.Fifty-odd black spots gradually flew toward the Misty Pavilion like a dark shadow.As soon as these black spots landed, many sharp eyed warriors found them to be fifty black bats which were about seven to eight meters long with a completely dark body and long tusks; they looked as if they were creatures from hell.Each bat was emitting a black aura which felt gloomy and frightening.Seated on each of those huge bats was a warrior, his face rigid, stance like a reaper, emitting a bloody aura; as if one\u2019s life was totally in his control.At the front of the group was a huge bat, on which was sitting a scar-faced, middle-aged man. His scars were very hideous.The scars on his face looked were like earthworms extending from his face down his neck; looking as if there was a veil on his actual face.He was emitting a deep and bloody aura. Whoever approached him would want to throw up from the suffocating smell.Fifty one Green-blooded Magical Bats landed before the Misty Pavilion.The master of the Misty Pavilion, Ku Luo, had waited for a long time with his people. As soon as he saw the guests, he kneeled down on one knee and greeted them respectfully, \u201cLord Xiao, this is Ku Luo from the Misty Pavilion.\u201dXiao Han Yi, who got down from the huge bat at the front, walked over at a leisurely pace.The people from the Misty Pavilion all turned pale and averted their eyes as he approached and could barely control their desire to vomit.One after another, these Shura escorts from the Yang family of the Endless Sea dismounted from their rides and followed after Xiao Han Yi to enter the Misty Pavilion.All the bats remained in the square outside the Misty Pavilion, watching the many kneeling warriors expectantly with their cold green eyes, treating them as if they were fresh meat.Being stared at in such a manner by the bats, the warriors of the Misty Pavilion were completely horrified and panicked a lot.Xiao Han Yi sat on the Head\u2019s seat casually and glanced at Ku Luo, \u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201d\u201cMiss\u2026 Miss Xia went to the Dead Swamp, since the Gate of Heaven was found there. The treasure map was completed.\u201d Ku Luo was anxious.\u201cI\u2019m not asking about that!\u201d Xiao Han Yi\u2019s face turned cold.An invisible power exploded outwards within the pavilion suddenly!That power constricted Ku Luo as if there was big hand on his neck, and lifted him to drop him in front of Xiao Han Yi.\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cLord!\u201dKu Luo\u2019s family members all were horrified and looked at Xiao Han Yi in anger, ready to fight for their lives.Some of the Shura escorts coldly glanced at them indifferently, when one of them asked, \u201cLord, do you need to finish Ku Luo\u2019s family?\u201d\u201cLord Xiao!\u201d Ku Luo struggled, coughed, and begged in fear, \u201cLord Xiao, we\u2019ve tried our best! Give me some more time, we will find Yang Hai!\u201d\u201cKeep your eyes open.\u201d Xiao Han Yi stared at Ku Luo, and grunted.\u201cBang!\u201dKu Luo fell from mid-air and dropped to his knees on the ground. He nodded in fear and explained, \u201cWe took every man named Yang Hai to the Tianyun City but none of them was the one we want. We are searching out of town now and will get news soon.\u201d\u201cGive me the Blood Spirit Crystal\u201d Xiao Han Yi thought for a while and stretched out his hand.The Blood Spirit Crystal left by Xia Xin Yan on Ku Luo suddenly flew out from him and landed in Xiao Han Yi\u2019s hand.\u201cEverybody except Ku Luo, get out!\u201d After getting the Blood Spirit Crystal, Xiao Han Yi ordered calmly.\u201cAll dismissed!\u201d Ku Luo signalled to his people.Soon, there were only Xiao Han Yi\u2019s people left in the room.\u201cI don\u2019t have so much time.\u201d Xiao Han Yi grunted and said indifferently, \u201cIt turns out that the Xia Family is really slow. So much time for a single person.\u201dThen, Xiao Han Yi caressed the Blood Spirit Crystal and closed his eyes.Centered on Xiao Han Yi, a strong will pervaded throughout Tianyun City in all directions.Inside that Blood Spirit Crystal, a red light suddenly manifested and numerous faces, filled with all sorts of expressions, appeared on the surface of the crystal. Their faces flashed like ghosts inside the Blood Spirit Crystal, and none of them stayed for more than three seconds.\u201cThe God Search Skill!\u201d Ku Luo was shocked.The God Search Skill was a mysterious tracing skill. Once one had the target\u2019s blood, flesh, bone or even a hair, he could find the target with this skill. The better one can use his will, the larger the search area it could search.Xiao Han Yi closed his eyes, and his huge will power covered the entirety of Tianyun City.In Tianyun City, all the Nirvana warriors who had formed a Will Sea could feel clearly a horrifying Will Sea lingering above Tianyun City.Many experts in Tianyun City were astounded.This Will was more than two levels higher than Beiming Shang\u2019s, covering the entire Tianyun City, and kept moving further.At that time, all the experts in the five big families felt threatened. At this crucial point, every minister of the five families exchanged messages and started guessing what the Misty pavilion was going to do.The God Search Skill was continuing\u2026The horrifying Will Sea shook the whole Tianyun City like tornado, where every creature was tested.All of a sudden.Blood exploded in the Blood Spirit Crystal and odd light spots gathered, showing a fat face in it.The picture in the Blood Spirit Crystal turned clear.That guy was sitting in a carriage in the west of Tianyun City, heading for the city.Xiao Han Yi suddenly opened his eyes.\u201cWho is he?\u201d\u201cShi Jian\u2019s adopted son, Yang Hai!\u201d Ku Luo\u2019s face changed in astonishment.\u201cIt is him!\u201dXiao Han Yi quickly stood up and vanished.The next moment, the sound of Green Blood Magical Bats filling the sky came from the Misty Pavilion.One hour later, Xiao Han Yi brought Yang Hai back, who had a blank expression on his face.\u201cWho are you? Humph! Has the Mo family invited you here?\u201d Yang Hai was kind of calm, but when he saw Ku Luo, he shouted in anger, \u201cKu Luo! Has your Misty pavilion cooperated with the Mo family? What\u2019s going on? We three families worked together to search for the treasure. What the hell do you want to do?\u201dKu Luo smiled bitterly and made an apologising bow, saying in embarrassment, \u201cDifferent things. Different.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you, Young Master Hai, I\u2019m the leading Shura escort from the Yang Family, Xiao Han Yi.\u201d Xiao Han Yi bowed, \u201cI will explain everything to you.\u201dXiao Han Yi explained the story to Yang Hai politely, \u201cYoung Master Hai, our family head is battling in the Fourth Demon Area now, so I came to take you back. Since the family head threw you out of the Fourth Demon Area, he has been worried about you. But he was badly injured and had to recover first\u2026\u201d\u201cThe Endless Sea? The Yang Family?\u201d Yang Hai was shocked, confused and unable to think straight.Standing there, his expression continuously changed as different ideas popped up to his mind.Just then, he remembered that test Shi Yan did on him in the Gravity Room. His arm was cut but quickly recovered in presence of Han Feng, which showed it was an amazing Martial Spirit.Hearing Xiao Han Yi say such, he was sure that he meant it.However, he was used to living in the Merchant Union and Shi Jian was good to him, besides, his son Shi Yan was here, and he was not a warrior himself\u2026With all sorts of matters behind him, Yang Hai was so pressured that he didn\u2019t want to start a new life in the Endless Sea.After a long time, Yang Hai shook his head, \u201cI\u2019m not going to the Endless Sea. I never trained in Martial Arts. It\u2019s too late to begin training at this age. I\u2019m used to the life here, and don\u2019t want to live in the Endless Sea. I\u2019m afraid you have to leave without me. Just think I\u2019m dead.\u201d\u201cYoung Master Hai!\u201d Xiao Han Yi yelled, \u201cAs a descendant of the Yang family, you have to fight for the family!\u201dAfter a pause, Xiao Han Yi added, \u201cAlthough Young Master Hai is not young anymore, don\u2019t worry, the family head had expected it. He had long prepared an Immortal Pill, and this Royal Level pill will change you entirely! It will be easy for you to enter the Disaster Realm in ten years!\u201d\u201cImmortal Pill!\u201d Ku Luo cried out loud and tried to persuade Yang Hai, \u201cYoung Master Hai, the Immortal Pill is one of the seven magical medicines in the Endless Sea. One Immortal Pill can really change everything! Even your talent will change with it! Young Master Hai, seize this opportunity!\u201dRoyal Level Pills!Though the three Medicine Kings in the Medicine Valley were Soul Level Alchemists, they couldn\u2019t ever refine Royal Level pills.Till now, Royal Level pills had never appeared in the Fire Empire, God-blessed Empire or the Merchant Union!It was said that one Royal Level pill could change everything!Xiao Han Yi and Ku Luo\u2019s speech made Yang Hai rethink. His expressions changed in front of the temptation of the pill.\u201cI never trained Martial Arts since I was a kid, so I can\u2019t adapt even if I became a warrior right now.\u201dAfter a long silence, Yang Hai looked at Xiao Han Yi and said, \u201cMy heart has died since my wife\u2019s death.

Although he hadn\u2019t trained in the first seventeen years of his life, he advanced to the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm. Maybe you could give the Immortal Pill to him.\u201d\u201cShi Yan!\u201dKu Luo cried out and said to Xiao Han Yi, \u201cLord Xiao, Shi Yan is awesome! Young, with potential, ambitious and strong-minded!\u201d\u201cSeventeen, twin Martial Spirits, in the Third Sky of Nascent Realm.\u201d Xiao Han Yi mumbled to himself while his eyes lit up, \u201cWhere is he?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIn the Yin Valley of the Dead Swamp.\u201d Ku Luo ingratiated.\u201cYoung Master Hai, I will go see Shi Yan first.

    "Chapter 94": "Chapter 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 94 \u2013 I\u2019ll Go!Inside the Yin Valley.An enormous galaxy pattern emerged from the blood of the sky snake.In the middle of that galaxy pattern, thousands of lights gathered, forming into the blindingly bright Gate of Heaven.All the warriors gathered in the valley were looking at the Gate of Heaven, but none of them dared to enter first.On the other hand, Shi Yan was quite calmly standing beside Han Feng and Ku Long. He was secretly observing the Gate of Heaven, feeling joyful inside.He didn\u2019t get any of the nine demon crystals that came from the carcass of the Nine-headed Sky Snake. But seeing all those crystals getting destroyed made him immensely happy.But as he thought of the frightening power which could snatch away the demon crystals from the hands of Sky Realm warriors like Chi Xiao and Beiming Shang, he was very startled, and thought of prudence.Zhua Qi looked up into the sky, his expression was painful, and he kept murmuring under his breath, \u201cFather, father\u2026\u201dOne of the demon crystals that exploded came from a Level 8 Mud Dragon. A Level 8 demon crystal could sustain a piece of the demon beast\u2019s soul. So even if the body is destroyed, there is still a chance for resurrection because of the soul inside the demon crystal.However, the spirit inside the Level 8 demon crystal was clearly lifeless and dull. Very obviously, it must have been refined by some mysterious technique, making it just a power source with no ability to think of its own.That Level 8 demon crystal of the Mud Dragon had become a very important part in opening the Gate of Heaven.Although Zhua Qi was vicious, he still had a deep love and admiration for the Mud Dragon. One can only imagine the despair he must have felt when seeing the last hope of resurrecting his father getting destroyed.Beiming Shang, Chi Xiao, and Zou Zi He all quietly walked towards the Gate of Heaven. As the approached the Gate of Heaven, the more cautious were their steps.\u201cMistress\u2026\u201d The two giant men next to Xia Xin Yan looked at the mysterious pattern in the valley and hesitated.These two seemed to know some secrets about the mysterious pattern.Xia Xin Yan shook her head. She silently gazed at everything in a strange light, and looked at the far standing Shi Yan.Shi Yan was also secretly watching everyone, and once he saw Xia Xin Yan\u2019s looking towards him, he was dazed for a second, then lightly nodded to Xia Xin Yan.A complex feeling flickered through Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes. She also slowly nodded towards him, but no one knew what thoughts were going through her mind.\u201cThe Gate of Heaven has now opened, if you all are really not scared of death, then you may enter now.\u201d Xia Xin Yan didn\u2019t move from her place but saw Chi Xiao and Beiming Shang standing motionless before the Gate. She couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to mock them.\u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201dUnexpectedly, Zhua Qi, who was immersed in grief, suddenly roared, \u201cI\u2019d like to see what exactly is inside!\u201dThen, Zhua Qi\u2019s body moved as fast as lightning, storming into the Gate of Heaven like a moth to a flame, and disappeared into the bright white light.Zhua Qi\u2019s shadow quickly disappeared into the Gate of Heaven. The Gate only warped for second, and did not show any other change. It still maintained its bright shine, as if waiting for the entrance of another person.\u201cBrother Zou\u2026\u201d Beiming Shang looked at Zou Zi He, and pondered for a second, then said, \u201cWhat do you think?\u201dZou Zi He shook his head and said, \u201cWe\u2019re already at this point. If I return empty handed, I will regret it for the rest of my life. If you want the riches, you have to take the risks.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Beiming Shang nodded in agreement, he hesitated for a second, then turned to Beiming Ce and said, \u201cCe, you stay outside. Yin Kui, Jiu Shan, you guys take care of Ce.\u201dPausing, Beiming Shang then looked at Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan, and furrowed his brows, \u201cWhat do you guys think?\u201d\u201cI want to go look inside.\u201d Mu Yu Die knew that the Gate of Heaven would contain great danger, but she still didn\u2019t want to miss this chance of a lifetime.\u201cOkay, you may go in.\u201d Beiming Shang nodded, \u201cFollow me.\u201d Beiming Shang then followed after Zhua Qi and entered the Gate of Heaven.Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan exchanged a look. They both looked determined, and followed Beiming Shang into the Gate of Heaven.\u201cMister Chi Xiao, how about you?\u201d Xia Xin Yan said casually.\u201cOf course I will enter too.\u201d Chi Xiao smiled, he looked back at Zuo Shi and Shi Yan, and said, \u201cXiao Shi, you stay outside, I will go look inside alone.\u201d\u201cMaster, I wanna go inside it too.\u201d Zuo Shi pouted, and said reluctantly.\u201cAs a teacher, I\u2019ll go take a look at the situation first. If there are no problems, next time I will definitely take you along.\u201d Chi Xiao scolded her with a straight face, then said to Shi Yan and the rest, \u201cWhat about the Shi family? Would you send someone to go and take a look too?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Ku Long stood up, and said to Shi Yan.\u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201d Shi Yan\u2019s expression was cold, he shouted with a deep voice, as if he didn\u2019t care the dangers in the Gate of Heaven.Deep down he always had a daredevil factor and he liked to challenge unknown mysteries. The very reason why he came to this world was because of his exploration of the blue holes.Of course, he wouldn\u2019t want to sit out on the exploration of the Gate of Heaven.\u201cYoung Master, let Ku Long go.\u201d Han Feng said anxiously.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll go.\u201d Shi Yan shook his head, and insisted, \u201cI\u2019m very curious as to what really is in the Gate of Heaven. If I don\u2019t go, I will regret it forever!\u201dThen, before Han Feng and Ku Long could try to persuade him again, he immediately sprinted towards the Gate of Heaven.\u201cYoung Master!\u201dKu Long and Han Feng both screamed in fear, and they also ran towards the Gate of Heaven. By the time when they arrived at the Gate, Shi Yan\u2019s body just so happened to disappear into the Gate.The two exchanged glances, and without further hesitation, leaped into the Gate of Heaven.\u201cYou guys look after Xiao Shi.\u201d Chi Xiao told Wu Yun Lian and Chu Ping, then he also flew out and disappeared into the Gate of Heaven.In the matter of a few minutes, all the masters in the valley leaped into the Gate one after another. Truly, like the saying, people die in pursuit for money like birds die for food.In the Yin Valley, the only ones left were Beiming Ce, Yin Kui and Jiu Shan on one side, plus Zuo Shi, Chu Ping, and Wu Yun Lian on the other. Then there were also Xia Xin Yan and the two towering giant men.\u201cMistress, this is a False Gate of Heaven!\u201d One of the giant men whispered.\u201cMmm hmm.\u201d Xia Xin Yan\u2019s eyes flickered, she stared at the Gate with the same expression.Right now the Sky Realm masters were all in the Gate of Heaven, plus Xia Xin Yan and the two were at a distance from the other two sides, so no one could hear their quiet conversation.\u201cThe False Gate won\u2019t have the real God Domain, this is only a small space created by a God Realm master. It won\u2019t contain any unimaginable treasures, but it should contain the relics of the God Realm master. Miss, why don\u2019t you go in? Maybe, maybe there\u2019s even the Martial Spirit inheritance of that person!\u201d One of the towering men said impatiently.\u201cDon\u2019t you all think that somewhere, there\u2019s an invisible hand that\u2019s manipulating this all?\u201d Xia Xin Yan snorted, \u201cHe already arranged everything on the chess board, and we\u2019re all just chess pieces in his game plan. We are all together but still could not escape from his control. That old guy\u2019s been dead for thousands of years and still won\u2019t rest in peace!\u201d\u201cMistress, you\u2019re saying?\u201d\u201cThe Shi family\u2019s half of the fragmented map was probably obtained by Shi Yan. That half of the map was definitely together with the [Black Formula]! The [Black Formula] is only a Mortal level Martial Skill and only warriors with low capabilities would actually go and cultivate it. That guy purposely set the place in the Yin Valley, forcing the one who has the [Black Formula] to cultivate it to defend against the natural Yin Qi. Once the [Black Formula] is cultivated, it would naturally swallow the Yin Qi here to form the Yin Pearls. Once the Yin Pearls form, the objective is clear. If the Gate of Heaven really had the Martial Spirit Imprint, then only the one with the Yin Pearls could obtain it. Now is there even a need for us to go in?\u201d Xia Xin Yan said resentfully, \u201c\u2026 That old guy, he already planned everything completely, he simply won\u2019t let anyone sabotage his plans. This time we came for nothing.\u201d\u201cIf Shi Yan obtains the Martial Spirit Imprint of that guy, then he will definitely become one of the God Children of the Three Gods Sect. If he could go to the Endless Sea, the Three Gods Sect would treat him like a treasure! Miss, the Three Gods Sect is very powerful in the Endless Sea, and they\u2019re in opposition with us. If he really does obtain that person\u2019s Martial Spirit Imprint, then he will definitely become the Star God of the Three Gods Sect in the future. We better\u2026 take him out now!\u201d\u201cI know what to do.\u201d Xia Xin Yan said coldly.The two towering men nodded, and became silent again.\u2014In a place with pitch black darkness, there came a woman\u2019s cold voice, \u201cAll of you go to the Gate of Heaven! Catch Mu Yu Die and assist the Lord to explore the mysteries of the Gate.\u201d\u201cYes, Mistress!\u201dA group of pale-faced warriors from the Dark World knelt down on one knee, with blank expressions.\u201cGo.\u201dThe voice in the dark came again.Dozens of warriors of the Dark World moved one by one, and soon entered the Yin Valley. Without even looking at the people in the valley, they walked straight into the Gate of Heaven.\u201cThe people from the Dark World!\u201d Beiming Ce shouted with a low voice, his expression slightly changed, \u201cThe Dark World should\u2019ve been guarding on the outside, why would they suddenly enter into the Gate of Heaven?\u201dAs Yin Kui and Jiu Shan watched the flow of warriors from the Dark World coming in, the look in their eyes became grim.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cIt can\u2019t be! We have to go in too, or else grandpa won\u2019t be able to handle it on his own.\u201d Beiming Ce pondered, and disregarding Yin Kui and Jiu Shan\u2019s opposition, he also rushed into the Gate.When Yin Kui and Jiu Shan saw that he went in, they could only follow along without hesitation.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Translated by: AmyEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Cronkite.Many thanks for your support.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-There was a huge star river in the sky, which was exactly like the pattern formed in the Yin Valley by the Sky Snake\u2019s blood.In that star river, every star was as big as a mountain, and the distance between the stars was like heaven and earth, hundreds of thousands of meters away.Under the star river were various numerous clouds, floating freely, and which were either formed of fire, Yin Qi or poisonous air.Gray sky and gray earth.On the ground lay a huge statue with its back on the ground. The statue was of a muscular, handsome figure, and sculpted to be clothed with only a stone shorts.The heart area of the stone statue was shining with starry light.The starry light was attracting the power in the star river, and similarly to the light from the starry river was becoming concentrated in the heart of the stone statue.The statue was carved very expertly, such that even the hair and veins were shown in exquisite delicacy. If one looked carefully, one could even see thousands of black spots moving through the veins.On the right palm of the stone statue, a little ant was staring up at the sky with a surprised look.That was Shi Yan!After he arrived here, he was standing on the right palm of the statue, with oddly swaying plants all around him.Those plants, which swayed with the wind, were ten meters high, and as thick as a human waist, looking like the statue\u2019s hair.Although he didn\u2019t know that the plants looked like hair from up in the air.In his eyes, the right palm of that statue was ten times larger than the God Stone Square in Tianyun City.Standing on that palm, Shi Yan looked at the mysterious star river above him and was filled with amazement.He wasn\u2019t aware that he was on the palm of statue, nor did he know how huge the statue was. He had lost his sense of direction and was of the assumption that he was on a small hill.\u201cTuuu! Tuuu!\u201dThe Yin Pearls in the Tian Que, Shen Que and Yin Du meridians suddenly started spinning, while a mysterious attraction force came from the heart of that stone statue.Shi Yan\u2019s body shook suddenly.The heart area which attracted the star light was calling for the Yin Pearls inside Shi Yan, and the Yin Pearls spun, as if urging him to go to the heart area.Standing on the palm of the stone statue, Shi Yan looked quite serious, and after a little hesitance, he dashed to the heart area of the statue directly.Meanwhile, the small black men on the stone statue observed for a while, and realized the heart area was the most powerful place.Therefore, after being still for a while, those people gathered at the chest of the stone statue.Those people included the warriors from the Dark World, Mu Hui, Mu Yu Die, Di Yalan, and Beiming Ce. All warriors under the Earth Realm were moving towards the heart area.Under the heels of the stone statue, Beiming Shang, Chi Xiao, Zhua Qi, the Dark Master, Yin Kui and Jiu Shan were suppressed by a huge power.Warriors above Earth Realm were all suppressed under its heels, unable to move even a bit.At that time, the group including Beiming Shang and Chi Xiao were trying to defend against the power which restrained them.But, however hard they tried, they couldn\u2019t get rid of that pressure or move an inch.\u201cTuuu! Tuuu!\u201dThe Yin Pearls inside Shi Yan kept spinning, while Shi Yan held his breath and dashed toward the stone statue with a rigid face.Beside Shi Yan, the hairs of the stone statue were swaying like tall trees and blocking his sight. He felt like he was in a jungle instead of the palm of the statue.Not knowing how much time had passed, Shi Yan finally flew from the mountain-like palm to its right leg.Shi Yan\u2019s rushing body suddenly stopped as he looked ahead on alert.From a deep hole in front of him, one after another flaming stone men suddenly jumped out!These stone men were three meters tall and were wreathed in fire, giving off the smell of the Nine-headed Sky Snake.If one looked down at it from upon the statue, he would find that that deep hole was actually the Yang Chi Meridian on its right arm!The twelve flaming stone men seemed to be disgusted by the smell of life. Once Shi Yan approached the hole, they appeared and jumped on him.Taking a deep breath, Shi Yan kept calm to operate his Petrification Martial Spirit and his skin turned dark brown in a short time.After he operated his Petrification Martial Spirit, Shi Yan triggered the [Dark Light Shield] by moving his Profound Qi all over his body.As the [Dark Light Shield] was formed, Shi Yan dashed out like a missile.\u201cDang dang dang!\u201dAmong the flaming stone men, Shi Yan turned his fingers into spears and struck the stone men.The [Finger Spear], which could pierce through an Elementary Realm warrior, emitted the sound of metal clashing while striking the stone bodies.The power of the fire went into Shi Yan\u2019s fingers when he touched the stone men, and felt pain in his fingers.No!His face changed, Shi Yan soon realized that the [Finger Spear] was inefficient when facing the stone men who were not made of flesh.\u201cBoom! Boom! Boom!\u201dSix stone men made flaming fists and punched Shi Yan together.His [Dark Light Shield] couldn\u2019t bear the attacks and fell apart.Under those fists, Shi Yan was driven back in pain, his clothes were on fire.Thanks to his Petrification Martial Spirit, his body was not hurt except for some pain.With a gloomy face, Shi Yan could figure out that every one of the six stone man was tougher than a Human Realm warrior.The [Finger Spear] was not working. He had to take another shot.As his will changed, Shi Yan\u2019s left hand gave out wisps of white smoke. Negative energy was triggered and combined with his Profound Qi. They flew out together and formed a huge [Gravitational Field].With his will, the [Gravitational Field] moved swiftly and suddenly fell in the center of the stone men.A strong power of attraction gushed out of the Field making all the stone men to struggle painfully.It worked!Delighted, Shi Yan enhanced the power in the Field and focused to twist it.\u201cPa! Pa! Pa!\u201dAs the Field span, one stone man was shattered into pieces and was thrown out of the Field.Shi Yan was a little relieved before his face changed again.However, after leaving the Field, the scattered parts of the stone man began to reform together. In merely three seconds, it had recombined and jumped at Shi Yan again.It was not killed!Realizing that, Shi Yan\u2019s face turned gloomier, and he triggered the Field again to change its position.That stone man was wrapped again and shredded to pieces another time.This time, Shi Yan didn\u2019t try to kill them, but crossed the Field in an instant and continued to dash forward after all the stone men were entangled.Half an hour later, from the deep hole of the stone statue\u2019s Zhigou Meridian, one after another Yin Sha danced out.Yin Sha was produced by warriors\u2019 spirits which absorbed Yin Qi. It was a dead thing, but could use part of the warrior\u2019s Martial Spirit. It was aggressive and in thirst of more spirits.Those Yin Sha waved their claws and flew toward Shi Yan from the deep hole.After a glance at the Yin Sha, Shi Yan\u2019s face turned cold.Inside the Yin pearl, wisps of Yin power pervaded and triggered the three Yin Swirls to spin, and a strong power of attraction broke out!Those Yin Sha suddenly showed fear and escaped to the deep hole.\u201cYou think you can escape?\u201dShi Yan smiled coldly, and the Yin Swirls span even faster!The Yin Sha struggled hard while being pulled by Shi Yan\u2019s Yin Swirls, but still forced towards Shi Yan little by little.The more they approached Shi Yan, the more they were they influenced by the Yin Swirl.All of a sudden, one Yin Sha stopped struggling and turned into Yin Qi and went inside Shi Yan\u2019s chest.The Yin Sha dissolved in the Yin Swirls and turned into pure energy which was attached to the center of the Yin Swirls.The rest of the Yin Sha struggled in fear but couldn\u2019t get escape the Yin Swirls. They were pulled in and turned into Yin Qi inside of it.Quickly, all the Yin Sha were absorbed and Shi Yan continued advancing.At the same time, the same thing was happening at every corner of the stone statue.Beiming Ce, Mu Yu Die, Di Yalan, Mu Hui and warriors from the Dark World also met danger when they headed for the heart. They were all trapped by the flaming stone men, Yin Sha, poisonous demons and mud dragons which came from the meridians of the stone statue.Shi Yan continued to rush forward.On his way, he came across more flaming stone men and Yin Sha, which were taken care of by the same means, and then he came to the right elbow slowly.Shi Yan stopped again.Ahead of him were five warriors from the Dark World, who all were around the First or Second Sky of the Human Realm. They had been separated from the others by the Gate of Heaven when thy entering. And now, all of them were heading for the heart but smelled like scorched flesh.The five warriors from the Dark World also spotted Shi Yan.They turned back, glanced at Shi Yan, and came to an agreement silently. With cold eyes, they walked towards Shi Yan slowly.\u201cWarriors from the Dark World?\u201dShi Yan\u2019s eyes were like torches as he spotted the sign of the Dark World on the bare shoulder of one warrior.\u201cKill!\u201dThat guy yelled when the rest separated to encircle Shi Yan in an arc.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou are seeking for death!\u201dWith a cold face, Shi Yan\u2019s eyes showed a bloodthirst. After a shout, he dashed out like a sharp sword.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Translated by: QianEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was only a single desire and that was to kill them all.Standing amid the five warriors from the Dark World, Shi Yan had a rigid face. One after another magic snakes made of negative energy tried to intertwine those warriors crazily.\u201cBang!\u201dOne Dark World warrior\u2019s [Dark World Ghost Claw] scratched Shi Yan\u2019s chest.\u201cHehe!\u201d Shi Yan chuckled cunningly as he kicked that warrior bluntly. His ten fingers were like spears and left ten bloody holes on the warrior\u2019s chest in an instant.With that guy\u2019s miserable screams, Shi Yan stepped back and blocked another attack from another warrior\u2019s green light to his head.Three [Gravitational Fields] formed quietly on his two sides and his back.Standing amid the three [Gravitational Fields], Shi Yan looked at the five Dark World warriors coldly, \u201cWant to kill me? Hehe. I want to kill you too!\u201d\u201cKill!\u201dThose Dark World warriors yelled and rushed forward together.The warrior who got five blood holes in his chest suddenly sat down cross-legged. Green thorns were triggered by him and shot from his palms.\u201cProfound Level Martial Skill, [Dark World Thorn]!\u201dDozens of icy, needle-like thorns flashed through the air toward Shi Yan like lightning.\u201cDang dang dang dang dang!\u201dThe crisp sound of metal on metal came from all over Shi Yan\u2019s body as the [Dark World Thorns] couldn\u2019t break Shi Yan\u2019s Petrification Martial Spirit.The badly injured man\u2019s pale face changed as he ordered, \u201cStrike together!\u201dThe other four warriors went to the four corners while Shi Yan was at the center point.Four blue curtains appeared from above their heads like clouds and formed together before they thrust toward Shi Yan.The blue curtains had so strong power that they bound Shi Yan in an instant.The four warriors were delighted as they jumped up and took out weapons to stab Shi Yan.\u201cField! Trigger!\u201dShi Yan shouted.The four warriors were inside the invisible [Gravitational Field] and were wrapped by them all of a sudden!Being greatly distorted, the four warriors turned stiff and couldn\u2019t even operate their Profound Qi. Deeply horrified, they didn\u2019t know what exactly had happened.\u201cHowl!\u201dShi Yan shouted into the sky, his muscles trembling. At the same time, the white smoke became denser and all sorts of negative energies were triggered.In an instant, a vicious power broke out inside Shi Yan\u2019s body and flashed through his body like an electric current.In the howls, Shi Yan managed to break through the blue curtain!\u201cBoom!\u201dA huge roar came, and the big blue curtain made from the four smaller ones exploded into blue light spots.Shi Yan smiled cunningly and coldly, and rushed into one [Gravitational Field] and thrust his [Finger Spear] into the warrior contained within!\u201cPuh!\u201dShi Yan\u2019s [Finger Spear] was thrust into the eyes of the warrior entangled in the Field. His eyes turned into two blood holes and even his brain could be seen. He died instantly.Shi Yan moved swiftly, crossing into the other two Fields.\u201cPuh!\u201d\u201cPuh!\u201d\u201cPuh!\u201dThe other three warriors were also bleeding from their eyes and died in the same way, in a very short time.The [Gravitational Field] suddenly contracted.The last Dark World warrior sitting on the ground was terrified and hurriedly tried to escape.\u201cDo you really think you can run away?\u201dShi Yan laughed coldly, while he flashed to the warrior and stabbed him in the back. His arm went right through the man\u2019s heart.Right now, all the five Dark World warriors were killed.Covered in blood, Shi Yan stood beside the five corpses, looking content. He was enjoying the negative energy flowing out from them.Soon, the five bodied dried up, while Shi Yan\u2019s meridians were filled with Profound Qi and his desire for blood surged!Without any attempt to suppress the effects, Shi Yan kept [Rampage] activated while his desire to kill was strengthened. He walked to the heart area.Half an hour later, another two warriors of the Second Sky of the Nascent Realm encountered him.Without uttering any word, Shi Yan dashed over with a hideous face. Under the bloodthirsty effects of [Rampage], he killed the two warriors easily and continued his journey.Twelve Yin Sha suddenly flew up from a deep hole ahead when they saw Shi Yan.\u201cHehe!\u201dShi Yan chuckled coldly but in a happy mood. He shifted his Yin Swirls and a huge attraction force came into being.The twelve Yin Sha were eventually swallowed by Shi Yan\u2019s Yin Swirls and turned into Yin Qi.All sorts of negative energy was purifying and gushing out of Shi Yan\u2019s meridians.Ignoring the abnormal state of his body, Shi Yan kept advancing.All along the way, Shi Yan became a god of slaughter as he killed instantly as long as he saw a Dark World warrior.The Dark World warriors in this area were mostly at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm or the First or Second Sky of the Human Realm. They couldn\u2019t compete with Shi Yan and were all killed by him.All along the way, Shi Yan killed twenty one Dark World warriors, absorbed sixty five Yin Sha and finally reached the right shoulder of the stone statue.Mu Hui\u2019s figure suddenly popped out from a deep hole ahead.Beside him stood three Dark World warriors of the Third Sky of the Human Realm.Inside the deep hole, three destroyed Mud Dragons were wriggling, trying to reconstruct their bodies.Mu Hui frowned and a slight resignation flashed across his odd face, \u201cThese thing are too tough and can\u2019t be killed. There are hundreds of them in every deep hole which keeps consuming my Profound Qi.\u201d\u201cYoung Master, someone\u2019s there.\u201d A Dark World warrior pointed to Shi Yan.Shi Yan was surrounded by white smoke and a murderous air boiled around him. The blood on him turned into blood cocoons while he smiled a bloody smile.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d Mu Hui was surprised and recognized he was Shi Yan who always stood beside Han Feng and Ku Long.While Mu Hui was in the Yin Valley, he had observed but didn\u2019t pay much attention to Shi Yan. Rather, he was more focused on the experts like Zhua Qi and Xia Xin Yan.Since Shi Yan was only at the First Sky of the Human Realm, Mu Hui never took him seriously.Seeing Shi Yan approaching with a murderous air, Mu Hui was perplexed, not knowing what happened to Shi Yan.\u201cYoung Master, we have to kill whoever we meet.\u201d That warrior wore a plain expression, \u201cThe earlier we kill one, the earlier we have less adversaries! The Mistress of the Dark World has ordered that we even have to kill Beiming Ce if we met him!\u201d\u201cHmm. One of you stay and take care of him. The rest follow me.\u201d Mu Hui nodded and ordered, then turned to walk ahead.Two warriors followed Mu Hui quietly and left at once.That talkative guy stayed there, looking at Shi Yan coldly, \u201cYou have bad luck.\u201d\u201cBad luck?\u201d Shi Yan laughed wildly, \u201cActually I have rather good luck! Really good! You Dark World warriors fed me well! Hehe, I have killed twenty one Dark World warriors! And you will be my twenty second!\u201dJust then, Shi Yan rushed towards him.Two minutes later, that talkative warrior turned into a dry dead body, his head and body separated.Shi Yan sucked up his negative energy and continued to run up.Ten minutes later, Shi Yan saw Mu Hui and the other two warriors again.\u201cWhat? Li Tuo was killed by you?\u201d Mu Hui then took Shi Yan seriously and his face turned dignified, \u201cA First Sky of the Human Realm killed Li Tuo who was at the Third Sky. It seems you are something.\u201dShi Yan didn\u2019t answer, but smiled coldly. His desire for blood was increasing rapidly as he walked towards Mu Hui step by step.Mu Hui was at the Third Sky of the Human Realm, but since he had a Martial Spirit and trained in high-class Martial Skills, he was more capable than the average warrior of his level.Shi Yan approached him step by step, but although he looked vicious and insane, he was actually cool-minded.After five steps, he acutely perceived that Mu Hui was a formidable adversary.\u201cYou are already dead.\u201dMu Hui stared at him and yelled.\u201cYou are already dead!\u201dThe four words struck into Shi Yan\u2019s mind like some mysterious incantation.An astounding power suddenly exploded in Shi Yan\u2019s mind.The four words conquered his perception and stopped all his thoughts!\u201cKill him. So bored.\u201d Mu Hui ordered indifferently, and shook his head, before he walked forward quickly.The two warriors walked towards Shi Yan with dull expressions and stabbed Shi Yan with the swords in their hands.\u201cDang! Dang!\u201dThe sound of metal clashing came from Shi Yan\u2019s chest again.\u201cMm?\u201dThe two warriors\u2019 faces changed and they started to trigger more Profound Qi in their swords, then raised them to stab Shi Yan\u2019s eyes.The strong strikes on his chest suddenly woke him up from his confused state.In his eyes, two tips of sharp swords were expanding slowly.Surprised, Shi Yan shifted his head and the swords slipped past his temple; he could feel the coldness on the swords clearly.\u201cBang! Bang!\u201dA boiling negative energy exploded from Shi Yan\u2019s shoulders. Two bunches of pale light delved into the two warriors\u2019 bodies in an instant.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euStruck by the negative energy, the two warriors felt like they were being dragged into an endless blood sea and were being eaten by thousands of ghosts. They were dumbstruck.\u201cPuhhh!\u201d\u201cPuhhh!\u201dFive bloody holes appeared on their necks and blood came gushing out.Shi Yan looked on coldly as he tossed the blood on his fingers, absorbed the Profound Qi in them.

He bitterly watched Shi Yan who was walking towards him step by step.Three Human Realm warriors were individually killed by Shi Yan. Especially the last two, who died after he used his Soul Martial Spirit on Shi Yan!\u201cYou\u2019re not bad.\u201d Mu Hui slowly took a deep breath, \u201cThe result is still going to be the same though. You will still die in my hands!\u201dShi Yan\u2019s expression was slightly ferocious. The negative energies in all of his meridians were churning like waves and wisps of pale white fog covered his whole body.The different negative emotions were rampaging throughout his body. These violent and murderous thoughts formed a dominating will around his body. The will was like an evil spirit that could destroy everything in its path.However, his mentality was clear and calm as ever.Under the conditions of [Rampage], Shi Yan became very sensitive. He could feel the most minuscule details of the different essences in this bizarre world. He could even feel the circulation path of the Profound Qi in Mu Hui\u2019s body!The Soul Martial Spirit!This was the most mysterious kind of martial spirit. Warriors with the Soul Martial Spirit had the most formidable senses, with the power to delude people\u2019s minds with their speech. Their insight into the natural energies was also a lot broader than ordinary warriors.What Mu Hui had, was precisely the Soul Martial Spirit!Once he breaks into the Nirvana Realm and forms a Sea of Knowledge inside his mind, the Soul Martial Spirit would become even stronger! One sentence would have the power to drive people to madness and put them into a situation beyond redemption.Previously, with one sentence from Mu Hui, Shi Yan was put into a suspended dream, in which his body became cold and stiff. If it weren\u2019t for the negligence of those two Dark World warriors, he could\u2019ve already ended up dead back there.And because of that, this time when Shi Yan sprinted forward, the first thing he did was to securely guard his mind, as he didn\u2019t dare give another chance for Mu Hui to use the Soul Martial Spirit to paralyze his mind again.\u201cThe Shi family\u2019s Petrification Martial Spirit sure is something. It looks like those two weren\u2019t able to kill you in one shot and that\u2019s what woke you up.\u201d Mu Hui looked at the sword gash on the clothes on Shi Yan\u2019s chest. His long, thin eyes slightly squinted, and a seductive light suddenly shone from his eyes.That beam of seductive light became brighter and brighter. Then slowly, Mu Hui\u2019s eyes became like bright and dazzling gems under the sun.A flow of deluding mental power was released from those eyes. This mental power was like an invisible storm that suddenly covered the whole area!\u201cLock!\u201dMu Hui shouted.Shi Yan\u2019s whole body stiffened and his eyes became dazed again. The Profound Qi in his body behaved as if it was frozen and became hard to circulate.\u201c[Dark Spirit Knife]!\u201dMu Hui raised his right arm and green electric light shot from his five fingers which quickly condensed under his control. Soon, a long knife formed in his hand, shining with a strange green light.The long knife looked like it was real and gave off a dazzling and chilling bright light.Holding the [Dark Spirit Knife], there was a confident smile on Mu Hui\u2019s lips. He slowly walked towards Shi Yan as if taking a casual stroll.\u201cLub-dub! Lub-dub!\u201dAt Shi Yan\u2019s chest, the Yin Pearls continuously pulsed. Summoned by the strange light spots at the stone statue\u2019s heart, the Yin Pearls in his meridians became more and more restless.The traumatized Shi Yan suddenly felt a strange movement in the Yin Pearls.His soul felt as if it was in an endless dark abyss. It was sinking quickly, like it was going to be swallowed by the abyss and could never have its own individual thought again.Suddenly!The negative energies fiercely burst from the meridians in his head! Feelings of bloodlust, madness and hate quickly flowed into the abyss, and entered the mind of Shi Yan as it was falling into the dark abyss.\u201cBoom!\u201dHis head suddenly shook, and Shi Yan\u2019s degrading mind was forcibly cleared by the negative energies.\u201cWhat?!\u201dMu Hui immediately noticed the change. He exclaimed, and the [Dark Spirit Knife] in his hand swung down without hesitation!\u201cBzz bzz bzz!\u201dThe air exploded wherever the [Dark Spirit Knife] went. And in its glowing green light, the [Dark Spirit Knife] became thinner and thinner, almost as thin as an onion skin.After Shi Yan was wide awake, he saw the [Dark Spirit Knife] coming straight at him. His heart shook and without hesitation he dodged to the left.\u201cPu!\u201dA beam of electric light flashed, and a deep bloody gash appeared on Shi Yan\u2019s right arm. What sort of power was affixed to the knife that it was able to break his Petrification Martial Spirit?!Shi Yan\u2019s expression suddenly changed!Mu Hui\u2019s eyes were also full of surprise, his expression became more serious, and said, \u201cNot bad, this slash only left a gash and didn\u2019t chop your whole arm off. The Petrification Martial Spirit from the Shi family indeed has astonishing defensive powers.\u201dUsually when Mu Hui pulled out the [Dark Spirit Knife], even Disaster Realm warriors would avoid it. Not many would go into close combat with Mu Hui when he\u2019s holding the [Dark Spirit Knife].From Mu Hui\u2019s perspective, even though the Shi family\u2019s Martial Spirit was extraordinary, it was still flesh and blood in nature, and shouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the energy of the dead spirits in the [Dark Spirit Knife].However, one slash didn\u2019t sever Shi Yan\u2019s arm and only left a mere bloody gash.He was even more surprised than Shi Yan was!Backing away quickly, Shi Yan took in a deep breath and secretly released three [Gravitational Fields] and tried to incite the [Black Formula] at the same time.This was the first time he had used the [Black Formula] in combat!The six Yin Pearls combined their forces, releasing a surge of Yin power that followed along Shi Yan\u2019s arm and rushed straight towards the palm of his right hand.A head-sized green light ball quickly formed in his palm. Electric snakes intertwined inside the green light ball, and wisps of chilling evil powers flowed out from inside the ball. It was filled with a dark, cold ambience.Yin power continued to vigorously flow into the light ball!The green light ball became bigger and bigger. In just in a few seconds, the light ball was already the size of a basin, shooting out green light like a green sun.Mu Hui\u2019s expression shook for the first time.\u201cFriend, stop struggling.\u201d Mu Hui said, the Soul Martial Spirit was like a shockwave, and it struck at Shi Yan\u2019s soul again.\u201cBlast!\u201dBefore the Soul Martial Spirit could unleash its effect, Shi Yan suddenly roared. The green light ball in his hand abruptly flew out, and smashed at Mu Hui like lightning.\u201cBoom!\u201dAll of a sudden, the green light ball burst out and wisps of pure Yin power, along with traces of Shi Yan\u2019s will, fell towards Mu Hui like raindrops.At the sound of the explosion, Shi Yan\u2019s restricted soul was finally pulled out from the dark abyss by the negative energies.Clarity returned to his eyes.On the other side, Mu Hui was doused by the rain-like shower of Yin power. His body suddenly became stiff, and the circulation speed of his Profound Qi slowed down.The shining [Dark Spirit Knife] clenched in his hand was also flickering. It was also affected by the Yin power formed after the explosion of the green light ball.Move!The three [Gravitational Fields] suddenly drifted away from Shi Yan\u2019s side, and silently moved towards Mu Hui.Before Mu Hui could react, Shi Yan flew out like a missile, his thin body swiftly fell into one of the [Gravitational Fields], and stormed at Mu Hui with his fist.\u201cYou\u2019re dead meat!\u201d A bloody cold glare flickered across Mu Hui\u2019s eyes.\u201c[Handprint of the Dark God]!\u201dMu Hui raised his left hand, and the veins in his hand popped up. His left hand instantly became twice as big and turned a frightening dark green color.An ambience of dead souls came from his hand. Mu Hui raised his hand to strike, and as if it could block the space, smashing towards Shi Yan\u2019s iron fist head-on.\u201cBoom!\u201dIn the thundering rumble, Shi Yan\u2019s body was as solid as stone and balanced on the ground. But Mu Hui was completely in shock, his body was forcibly thrown back.The earthshaking terrifying power that projected from Shi Yan\u2019s fist exploded onto Mu Hui\u2019s [Handprint of the Dark God] and forcefully knocked Mu Hui away!Shi Yan, who was at the First Sky of the Human Realm, with his one punch, managed to make Mu Hui, who was at the Third Sky of the Human Realm, to lose ground!Under the effect of [Rampage], this punch, which was accompanied by the different negative energies, skyrocketed in power. It was definitely not something that a warrior of the same realm could handle!This was just the beginning of Mu Hui\u2019s suffering.Just when he finally managed to steady himself, he suddenly felt like he had sunk into a swamp, and his body rotated uncontrollably.He was directly sucked into a [Gravitational Field] set up by Shi Yan!Mu Hui\u2019s face suddenly changed!\u201cHehe!\u201d Shi Yan grinned, but his eyes were as cold as ice. He fiercely flew out.\u201cCrush!\u201dMu Hui roared inside the [Gravitational Field] and an enormous flow of spiritual energy suddenly poured into Shi Yan\u2019s mind.Shi Yan\u2019s flying body stopped midway and fell to the ground.Mu Hui\u2019s expression was grim, the [Dark Spirit Knife] in his hand drew a strange arc and wisps of dark, cold energy flowed from the [Dark Spirit Knife] and churned inside the Gravitational Field.The Soul Martial Spirit was triggered again! Mu Hui kept secretly reminding himself to be calm. He put in all his concentration to feel the power change in the Field, trying to figure out a way to escape from it.But, the [Gravitational Field] was a Spirit Level Martial Skill after all. Plus it was also formed with both the negative energies and Profound Qi. Despite having the Soul Martial Spirit, Mu Hui still couldn\u2019t figure out any pattern in a short period of time.The high speed whirling of the [Gravitational Field] not only slowed down the flow of his Profound Qi, it seemed to also weaken the sensitivity of his Soul Martial Spirit!There were already traces of sweat on Mu Hui\u2019s forehead, his body kept rotating, but he couldn\u2019t figure out the pattern of the [Gravitational Field].On the other hand, Shi Yan only lay on the ground for a moment before the outburst of negative energies dragged him out of the dark abyss again.Shi Yan\u2019s eyes suddenly became clear again and he sneered. He stared coldly at the whirling Mu Hui in the [Gravitational Field]. With just a change of his thoughts, he stirred up the Yin power in his body, and poured it into the [Gravitational Field] once again.In the [Gravitational Field], with more power added, the gravitational force became stronger!Just by circulating the negative energies and Profound Qi, the [Gravitational Field] could already forcibly stop a warrior of the same realm. Now that he added Yin power to the Field, the power of the [Gravitational Field] surged once again!A flow of chaotic power suddenly burst from the [Gravitational Field]. The circulation speed of the Field doubled!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cPu!\u201dMu Hui spurted out a mouthful of blood and he felt as if his Soul Martial Spirit was in a meat grinder. A stabbing pain was assaulting his head and all the Profound Qi in his body was ground into a mess. His defense became significantly lower too.Shi Yan held in his breath to concentrate and his expression was cold and stern. He used all his will to manipulate the [Gravitational Field].The chaos of the [Gravitational Field] was full-blown!The frantic grinding power violently tore Mu Hui\u2019s body. In the Field, Mu Hui\u2019s whole body was splattered with blood, his flesh torn and exposed. The seductive light in his eyes also slowly dimmed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His spine broke and he died tragically in the Field.All the Profound Qi in Mu Hui\u2019s body flowed into the seven hundred and twenty meridians in Shi Yan\u2019s body.Mu Hui was at the Third Sky of the Human Realm, but his Profound Qi was much richer than other warriors of the same realm.The time it took Shi Yan to absorb all the power in his body was also a few dozen seconds more than with other people.Soon, Mu Hui turned into a dry corpse and fell to the ground lifelessly.Shi Yan\u2019s expression was calm, he closed his eyes to feel the Profound Qi that came from Mu Hui\u2019s body. Feeling the changes in his meridians, he slowly sat down on the ground.There was a swelling pain coming from his meridians. The continuous intake of Profound Qi from many warriors made his meridians sting slightly. The different negative energies kept pounding in his body, agitating his soul.However, this time the backlash in his body was not that fierce and crazy and he didn\u2019t know why.As he calmed down and removed himself from the effects of [Rampage], Shi Yan realized his whole body was sore. But the overflowing negative energies did not overpower his mentality, nor made him fall into a state of slaughter and chaos.Closing his eyes and calming himself down, he felt the purification of negative energies in his meridians. Shi Yan quietly tried to find the source.A change in his soul!After quite a while, Shi Yan\u2019s mind flickered and there was an answer in his mind.During the fight with Mu Hui, his Soul Martial Spirit occasionally unleashed strange effects and repeatedly tried to pull Shi Yan\u2019s soul into an abyss of darkness, to become a captive under the power of his mind.Whenever that happened, the negative energies in Shi Yan\u2019s body would suddenly burst out.Those negative energies rushed to the depth of his soul like lightning and forcibly dragged his consciousness out of the dark abyss, letting him escape the shackles of Mu Hui\u2019s Soul Martial Spirit instantly.Because of Mu Hui\u2019s Soul Martial Spirit, the negative energies broke out again and again, using the dark, evil, negative powers to attack Mu Hui\u2019s Soul Martial Spirit. During the clash, the negative energies that should have crumbled Shi Yan\u2019s soul were mostly used up fighting against Mu Hui\u2019s soul attacks.The violent negative energies should have caused Shi Yan to fall into a state beyond redemption. Yet because of the existence of Mu Hui\u2019s Soul Martial Spirit, those negative energies became an aid to defeat Mu Hui\u2019s soul attacks.That means, the Soul Martial Spirit used by Mu Hui counteracted the negative energies that could have destroyed Shi Yan\u2019s mind and helped him recover himself.These string of thoughts rapidly flashed through Shi Yan\u2019s mind, and he was correctly able to determine that the reason he didn\u2019t face the tremendous backlash from the negative energies was due to it acting as a constraint against Mu Hui\u2019s attacks from his Soul Martial Spirit.Deep in his heart, there were hints of violent and murderous thoughts growing, but these thoughts were no longer that intense. Using his strong will, Shi Yan didn\u2019t fall into a state of frantic killing.Thinking through these things, he relaxedly sat on the ground and silently started to circulate his Profound Qi.After some time, the stinging in the meridians of his body suddenly started becoming intense!Under the tearing pain, wisps of pure strange power slowly flowed out of his meridians, forming streams of warm currents in his body.After transforming the Profound Qi of the many Human Realm warriors, the extraordinary power that resulted was quite impressive. Most of the power spread throughout Shi Yan\u2019s whole body and disappeared into his flesh, bones, meridians, and organs. Only a minority of the extraordinary power gathered in the Profound Qi in his dantain, making his Profound Qi much stronger and purer.Shi Yan\u2019s heart was calm, he didn\u2019t first go and explore the change in his Profound Qi, but instead he sank his mind into the flesh, bones and meridians of his body.He could clearly feel that the wisps of mysterious power formed into what was like a magical nutrient. And in a way he couldn\u2019t understand, it was slowly nourishing his whole body\u2026During this process, Shi Yan felt like he was bathing in a hot spring. Every pore on his body relaxed and were all taking in that miraculous nutrient. His body was slowly silently changing\u2026Those mysterious powers moved around in his meridians, disappearing into his flesh and bones, taking root in his organs, and resting in his skull\u2026He digested the information deeply.It was not the Petrification Martial Spirit!Shi Yan\u2019s mind was crystal clear, he immediately realized the mysterious power that was nourishing his body was definitely not the Petrification Martial Spirit.It was the Immortal Martial Spirit!A realization popped into his mind and Shi Yan suddenly opened his eyes. He quickly looked at his right arm.The right arm that was slashed by the [Dark Spirit Knife] had a deep wound. But now, the flesh in the wound was slowly wiggling and healing at a visible speed!The flesh and the meridians seemed as if they had a life of their own!Under the watchful eyes of Shi Yan, the wound that was two centimeters deep gradually healed bit by bit, the flesh wreathed together and the cells reformed. The wound slowly closed up, forming into a scar, then finally disappeared altogether.Ten minutes!In a mere ten minutes, the two centimeter deep wound had been completely healed and not even a single trace was left.The place at which his right arm was harmed was now as smooth as glass. There was not even a single line, nor a trace of blood! It was as if he was never hurt!Shi Yan moved his arm and realized there wasn\u2019t even a single bit of pain. His right arm had no abnormalities whatsoever and felt same as the left arm.Shi Yan\u2019s eyes were bright, his face was irrepressibly ecstatic.In a span of ten minutes, such a deep wound was healed to its original state! There was no pain and no discomfort, when did his Immortal Martial Spirit become so impressive?Shi Yan clearly remembered that his recovery speed back then was definitely not this fast!Back then, even if his wound had been healed, he would still feel some discomfort and some pain. He would need more than half a day for a wound that size to be completely healed.This time, it was only ten minutes!The Immortal Martial Spirit has reached a new stage! After a short while, Shi Yan quickly and keenly grasped the key point.The magical upgrade of the Petrification Martial Spirit reminded him, and made him realize that after consuming so much Profound Qi, those extraordinary powers activated the Immortal Martial Spirit just like how it did with the Petrification Martial Spirit. And now the Immortal Martial Spirit had entered a new stage.No wonder all those extraordinary powers mostly flowed into his flesh, meridians, bones and organs. Turns out this time it was the nourishing his Immortal Martial Spirit.Now everything was clear.Shi Yan\u2019s expression was full of joy. He seriously felt the changes in his body, then after a while he finally calmed down, and continued to sit there and circulate his Profound Qi.The Profound Qi in his dantain had also absorbed a part of that extraordinary power. Now, under the shifting of his thoughts, the purer Profound Qi slowly flowed along all the meridians in his body.Every time after completing a full cycle, the cluster of the most pristine Profound Qi in his dantain became more refined.Slowly, the refined body of Profound Qi turned into what was like a bright light ball. With every circulation cycle, the size of the light ball became smaller, but the power it contained grew even more!Shi Yan was delighted again.The change in the Profound Qi light ball was exactly a special sign of the breakthrough from the First Sky of the Human Realm to the Second or Third Sky!Starting from the First Sky of the Human Realm, every time you reached a new Sky, the size of the Profound Qi light ball in the dantain would become smaller. But the Profound Qi within would grow stronger in power!This was the process of refinement.Only when you refined over and over again, would the impurities in the Profound Qi light ball be completely cleared. And only then would the Profound Qi become more and more pure, followed by the strengthening of the power it contains.Realizing that this was the golden opportunity to break from the First Sky to the Second Sky of the Human Realm, Shi Yan didn\u2019t dare to hesitate. He concentrated with all of his will to circulate his Profound Qi.He repeatedly circulated and refined his Profound Qi. The impurities in the Profound Qi lessened, making the Profound Qi become more and more pure\u2026In that strange space, there was no concept of time.After who knows how long, the Profound Qi light ball shrunk from the size of a fist to the size of a walnut.However, the concentration of the Profound Qi was thirty percent stronger than before!Not only that, the purer Profound Qi was circulating in his body at a speed twice as fast as before!Under his will, a wisp of Profound Qi flowed out of his fingertip. It was shining in dazzling white light, and there was a faint glistening tint in it, like some mysterious crystal.Shi Yan had a joyous look on his face. He looked at the wisp of glistening Profound Qi, and the smile on his lips slowly widened\u2026Human Realm, Second Sky!This time the warriors from the Dark World really fattened him up. Not only did his Immortal Martial Spirit enter into a new stage, he also reached a step further in his martial art realm, and straight up entered the Second Sky of the Human Realm.\u201cLub-dub! Lub-dub, lub-dub!\u201dThe Yin Pearls from the three meridians of Shen Que, Tian Que, and Yin Du suddenly started pulsing violently! The pulse rate of the Yin Pearls this time was much faster than usual! The summoning power from the heart of the stone statue also grew stronger!Shi Yan\u2019s mind flicked, he couldn\u2019t help but gaze towards the place where the starlight gathered. He suddenly realized that the light from the starry sky seemed to become disordered. They wandered at that one area like fireflies, but didn\u2019t flow into the mysterious place anymore.There was a change!Shi Yan\u2019s brows furrowed.

It was like staring at the starry sky when one looked at that crystal.The heart-shape crystal was as large as a fist, as if it was a big light spot in the hole, although it was sending out dazzling lights and overwhelming energy.On the wall of the hole, dense bunches of dazzling lights flashed into the red crystal and covered the glittering crystal like a natural shield.Off to the side of the deep hole, Beiming Ce looked indifferent, and the three warriors were staring at the crystal in surprise.Up in the sky, the massive star river pattern projected its light onto the crystal and drifted by slowly.Every warrior could feel the mysterious energy from that crystal, as if it had the ability to concentrate all the power from the stars, it was attracting every warrior.No matter if it was Beiming Ce or the three Dark World warriors, they all stared at the crystal greedily.\u201cWhy hasn\u2019t the Young Master arrived? This mysterious crystal will be taken by Beiming Ce!\u201d A Dark World warrior at the First Sky of the Disaster Realm said coldly, his face looked weird in the light of the crystal.The other two warriors of the Third Sky of the Human Realm were standing separately by his side, keeping watch for Mu Hui who could show up any second.Beiming Ce stretched out his left hand again and blue flames flew out. The blue flames flew up into the sky and turned into a huge blue hand projecting onto the crystal.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe light shield on the crystal produced a huge deafening sound and blocked Beiming Ce\u2019s huge hand made from his Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit.The huge blue hand shattered as soon as it touched the light shield.Bunches of blue flames turned into small flames and shot above the light shield. Gradually, it turned back into a huge blue hand again.Beiming Ce didn\u2019t give up, as he triggered his Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit again.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe light shield defended again, shattering Beiming Ce\u2019s Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit and turning it back to blue flames.Under Beiming Ce\u2019s consistent attacks, the light shield was twisted and squeezed like a balloon, causing it to withdraw into the crystal a bit.Beiming Ce\u2019s Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit had an icy air which could freeze everything. Every time the huge hand touched the light shield the icy air would permeate into it.After several times, the defensive power of the light shield became weaker.A secret delight flashed in Beiming Ce\u2019s eyes.\u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201dUnder the three warriors\u2019 eyes, Beiming Ce operated his Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit again and again to seize that crystal, permeating the icy air into the light shield to decrease its defensive power.\u201cThis is bad!\u201dThe Disaster Realm warrior changed his expression, as he said in a low voice, \u201cBeiming Ce will get the crystal soon if he is not disturbed.

[Dark World Thorns] flew toward Beiming Ce.Beiming Ce\u2019s face turned icy as he said coldly, \u201cYou finally can\u2019t wait.\u201dImmediately, Beiming Ce vanished into the air.The next moment, Beiming Ce appeared right beside them, and the polar ice flame turned into small bunches of flames and tried to wrap up the three warriors.The three were terrified and soon worked together to fight against Beiming Ce.\u201c[Teleport]!\u201dBeiming Ce yelled and vanished again.\u201cBang!\u201dA warrior of the Third Sky of the Human Realm fell to the ground on his back.Then, Beiming Ce showed a cold smile, \u201cYou guys want to compete with me?\u201dBunches of blue flames crossed by the frozen man who died quickly.\u201c[Teleport]!\u201dBeiming Ce yelled again and appeared behind another warrior and patted his head.\u201cPaaa!\u201dThat guy\u2019s head exploded and he died instantly.The last Disaster Realm warrior sat down in terror and tried to trigger more [Dark World Thorns].Green needle-like thorns came out from his body and shot in all directions.\u201cYou are a Disaster Realm warrior, but you are not favored by god for you don\u2019t have a Martial Spirit.\u201d Beiming Ce smirked.An ice wall coagulated from polar ice flames appeared in front of him and the thorns were blocked.The Disaster Realm warrior shifted his face. Without hesitation, he continued to trigger his thorns which shot in all directions.He knew that Beiming Ce has the Teleport Martial Spirit, so he couldn\u2019t shoot his thorns in only one direction, although it consumed much of his Profound Qi.He wanted to buy more time for Mu Hui to arrive.Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t know that Mu Hui had already been killed by Shi Yan.Standing behind the ice wall, Beiming Ce was not in a hurry. He watched that warrior like a cat watching a mouse, \u201cI would like to see how long you can last.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t endure for long.Three minutes later, his thorns became less and less.To trigger the [Dark World Thorns] cost a lot of Profound Qi.Although the thorns were powerful, it consumed much Profound Qi.Therefore, he realized that his Profound Qi was about to run out.Why hadn\u2019t the Young Master arrived!That man looked around quickly and became more and more panicked.\u201cYou won\u2019t meet him.\u201d Knowing he was waiting for Mu Hui, Beiming Ce said indifferently, \u201cBecause you are going to die!\u201dThen Beiming Ce teleported again.This time, his body turned into hard ice and approached the warrior through the thorns.Under that guy\u2019s horrified eyes, the ice surrounding Beiming Ce\u2019s body expanded and he was covered by the polar ice flame.\u201cKak kak!\u201dHis body froze quickly and became an ice corpse. His terrified expression was also frozen on his face.Beiming Ce raised his leg and kicked the man with a disappointed face.\u201cPaa!\u201dThe frozen warrior was smashed into several pieces blocks of ice.His body was shattered.Beiming Ce walked at a leisure pace towards the deep hole, and frowned as he looked at the floating crystal, \u201cIt\u2019s finally quiet.\u201d\u201cTaa taa!\u201dJust then, light steps came from afar.Beiming Ce frowned with an annoyed face, \u201cToo annoying! These people from the Dark World! It\u2019s like they won\u2019t even disappear.\u201dTurning his head back, Beiming Ce looked to the direction where the footsteps came from.\u201cHmm?\u201dBeiming Ce wondered, and a smirk climbed up his mouth, \u201cWell, how surprising that this boy is still alive. The Dark World warriors are all crap.\u201dShi Yan stopped his steps and stared at Beiming Ce who looked gloomy.\u201cShi Yan, it\u2019s really lucky for you to live till now.\u201d Beiming Ce beamed, \u201cWe are both from the Merchant Union, the five big families, so we could be friends in the future. Therefore, I don\u2019t want to kill you. Leave now, and I can pretend that I\u2019ve never seen you here.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t want to kill me?\u201d Shi Yan beamed.\u201cNo. Leave! Before I change my mind.\u201d Beiming Ce nodded.\u201cBut, I want to kill you!\u201d With a smile in his corner of his mouth, Shi Yan\u2019s eyes still showed coldness as he replied, \u201cI have waited for too long.\u201dBeiming was surprised at first. Then he pulled himself together and said, \u201cSo audacious. Never mind, it won\u2019t take much time to kill you. And the Shi family will lose hope if I kill you. My grandpa will like it.\u201dAs he was talking, Beiming walked slowly toward him without using his teleport.\u201cTata! Tata!\u201dJust then, steps came from afar again.Before long, Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan ran in this direction in worry.As they arrived, they didn\u2019t even look at Shi Yan, instead focusing on Beiming Ce. Mu Yu Die asked happily, \u201cYoung Master Beiming, you\u2019ve arrived?\u201dBeiming Ce bowed a little and nodded to them with a smile, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ve been here for quite a while. Also I have cleaned some trash from the Dark World to avoid troubles later.\u201d\u201cWell, you haven\u2019t cleaned up this trouble.\u201d Shi Yan stated indifferently, appearing somewhat bored.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou? Hehe, you are far from able to cause me trouble.\u201d Beiming Ce scorned, \u201cIt\u2019s no harder to kill you than it is to kill an ant.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m waiting!\u201d\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-Translated by: QianEdited by: Moto, Chancs and VickPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And as a big thank you to our readers, look out for 5 bonus chapters coming soon.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-After Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan arrived, they said hello to Beiming Ce first and then were attracted by the floating crystal in the deep hole.They looked excited at the sight of the shining crystal and could clearly sense the mysterious energy from it.Every warrior was able to tell that this crystal was extraordinary!Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan had suffered a lot to get here. They fought against the Dark World warriors, flaming stone men, Yin Sha and mud dragons for the big chance here.As for Shi Yan, they just glanced at him once and turned away.In arrogance, Beiming Ce walked over to Shi Yan step by step without using his Teleport Martial Spirit.Shi Yan stood still, seemingly waiting for Beiming Ce to take action.He secretly activated his Petrification Martial Spirit and his body turned dark brown.Silently, Shi Yan blended his Yin power and Profound Qi, producing three [Gravitational Fields]. Controlled by his will, the three fields gradually separated.He had seen Beiming Ce\u2019s Teleport Martial Spirit and he knew it was a fierce Martial Spirit through Han Zhong. The three [Gravitational Fields] were prepared as a counter for the Teleport Martial Spirit.\u201cDon\u2019t blame me since you seek your death yourself.\u201d Beiming Ce raised his left hand as he got within ten meters of Shi Yan.Blue Polar Ice Flame appeared in his palm.As he threw out his arm, the blue flame became an Ice Bird which flew in the sky and left a graceful blue trail.That Ice Bird was so vivid that even the feathers on its head could be clearly seen. It was breathing blue flames from its mouth on its ice cold face.Beiming Ce looked on coldly with contempt in his eyes. For him, it wasn\u2019t too much effort to kill Shi Yan.Just as the Ice Bird flew near him, a cold light flashed across Shi Yan\u2019s eyes.A huge green light ball filled with dense Yin Qi suddenly shot out from his chest and it was intertwined with electricity and Yin Power.\u201cBoom!\u201dThe green light ball struck the Ice Bird and gave off thunder.Dazzling blue and green light exploded like fireworks while the green light ball and the Ice Bird cracked at the same time, turning into blue and green light spots.\u201cHmm?\u201dBeiming Ce frowned in surprise and nodded slowly while gazing at Shi Yan, \u201cGood. You really are something to kill Mo Zhan.\u201dAfter saying that, Beiming Ce\u2019s face turned rigid.More and more Polar Ice Flame was produced by him; he looked like a bunch of Ice Flames, with blue flames gushing out of his body towards Shi Yan from all directions.A biting cold came from those ice thorns as they approached.Standing there, Shi Yan felt as if the space surrounding him was frozen solid.In the cold air, his Profound Qi circulated slower. When the cold air came into contact with his skin, his bones and veins were nearly frozen.At that moment!A warm stream suddenly flew out from his blood and bones; his body was defending against the cold automatically.The Immortal Martial Spirit!Shi Yan\u2019s eyes lit up as he was secretly delighted.The warm stream went through his whole body like lightning. The next moment, he had gotten rid of the coldness.That happened in just a minute and the thousands of ice thorns were merely an inch away from him.\u201cYin Wall!\u201dA green shield appeared beside him which was made of Yin Power, dazzling and horrifying.The Yin Wall was like a huge upside down bowl which protected him. The Yin Wall was so thin and transparent that Shi Yan could see things ten meters away clearly.Although the [Black Formula] was a mere Mortal Level Martial Skill, it could absorb Yin Qi and turn it into Yin Swirls and Yin Pearls.The [Black Formula] was a Martial Skill which utilized Yin Qi. With the help of the Yin Swirls and Yin Pearls, Shi Yan could make Yin Qi into all sorts of defensive weapons. Once the Yin Pearls were alive, he would have endless Yin Qi.The Yin Wall was refined from Yin Qi. Just as triggering the [Dark Light Shield], once getting hang of the [Black Formula], Shi Yan found it could produce all sorts of defensive methods.The [Black Formula] seemed to bring him endless surprises.\u201cBooo! Boooo!\u201dThe thorns thrust towards him and landed on the dazzling green Yin Wall and their power was absorbed in an instant.Beiming Ce\u2019s Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit couldn\u2019t freeze the Yin Wall, let alone damage Shi Yan who was under it!Shi Yan hadn\u2019t even triggered his negative energy.The Yin Wall triggered by Yin Pearls seemed to control the Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit. Nonetheless, he still felt that the Yin Qi light spots were decreasing quickly.The power of the [Black Formula] could only be strengthened by Yin Qi.The Yin Power used for his Yin Wall could be consumed and not produced. Without Yin Qi, the Yin Power from the Yin Pearls wouldn\u2019t increase.But this time, Shi Yan had absorbed all the Yin Qi in the Yin Field and formed six Yin Pearls inside himself, which would let him play with Beiming Ce for a long time!Icy thorns thrust on the green wall and the cold air permeated into it, but this was soon digested by the Yin Power within.Thus their battle was a deadlock from the very beginning.Beiming Ce couldn\u2019t believe that Shi Yan\u2019s green wall could bear the coldness from his Polar Ice Flame. To him, Shi Yan could only endure for a few seconds.He didn\u2019t know that Shi Yan had advanced to the Second Sky of the Human Realm.Thus, he kept producing more polar ice, forming ice thorns and shooting them towards Shi Yan\u2019s green shield.Shi Yan had absorbed so much Yin Qi which had formed six powerful Yin Pearls. He was not afraid of Beiming Ce at all, even though he was at the Disaster Realm.Furthermore, Shi Yan hadn\u2019t used his negative energy yet!Therefore, he was very willing to continue the battle with Beiming Ce.Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan watched the two curiously.The two girls knew how capable Beiming Ce was.Disaster Realm! Twin Martial Spirit! Training in the most precious Martial Skill of the Beiming family; Beiming Ce was at the top of the world!Though at the First Sky of the Disaster Realm, Beiming Ce could even win against someone of the Second Sky! He would even have a shot against a Third Sky warrior!However, while battling with this boy from the Shi family, Beiming Ce\u2019s Polar Ice Flame Martial Spirit couldn\u2019t even break his barrier!That confused Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan.Though Shi Yan had made great impression on the two girls in the Martial Competition in the God Stone Square, he was merely a warrior at the Third Sky of the Nascent Realm.It had only been two months after the Martial Competition, Shi Yan could reach the First Sky of the Human Realm if he was talented.How could a Human Realm, First Sky warrior survive against Beiming Ce?Seeing Shi Yan unmoved under Beiming Ce\u2019s attacks, the two girls were quite surprised and looked at Shi Yan with confusion in their eyes.Five minutes! Ten minutes! Half an hour!After half an hour, the Yin Wall which encircled Shi Yan still could not be broken.Shi Yan looked indifferent but patient, happy to continue the fight.Beiming Ce couldn\u2019t stand it anymore.After pondering for a while, Beiming Ce withdrew his Polar Ice Flame and stopped his attack. He said coldly, \u201cI can\u2019t be bothered wasting any more time with you.\u201dA strange, red and blue sword was slowly taken out by Beiming Ce.\u201cSky Cracking Sword!\u201dMu Yu Die and Di Yalan took a deep breath at the same time and looked at Shi Yan in pity, assuming that Shi Yan was about to die for sure.The Sky Cracking Sword was a Spirit Level weapon which previously belonged to Beiming Shang. Beiming Shang entered the earth\u2019s core where there were thousands of fire hills and refined it with earth fire and polar ice for three years.The Sky Cracking Sword had two colors on it. One half was red and the other half blue.With the help of the Sky Cracking Sword, Beiming Ce made his name in Tianyun City and never had an adversary. The Sky Cracking Sword was sharp, unbreakable and had the power of earth fire and polar ice.Warriors who were touched by the Sky Cracking Sword would first freeze then burn.Mu Yu Die and Di Yalan knew how vicious this Sky Cracking Sword was.Therefore, once the Sky Cracking Sword was taken out, the two girls assumed Shi Yan was going to die for sure.[Teleport]!Beiming Ce yelled and appeared in front of Shi Yan with the Sky Cracking Sword. He thrust it in the air and it gave out red and blue light.\u201cChee!\u201dThe Yin Wall was cut into two pieces by the Sky Cracking Sword.Shi Yan was shocked! He immediately triggered his power and shuttled behind the [Gravitational Field].Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMeanwhile, the other two [Gravitational Fields] flew over suddenly, combining with the first one.The space Shi Yan around was twisted a little, seeming to be squeezed and about to collapse.Standing in the invisible house-like [Gravitational Field], Shi Yan calmed down, though his eyes grew more vicious while staring at Beiming Ce.Shi Yan was waiting for Beiming Ce to trigger his Teleport Martial Spirit again, for him to enter the [Gravitational Field]!Beiming Ce turned out to not disappoint him, as he triggered his Teleport Martial Spirit another time!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
