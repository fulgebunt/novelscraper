The bright sunlight seemed to be absent from sight.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAny thinking instantly tightened his chest painfully. So he wished he wouldn\u2019t think of anything. He was breathing just simply, but that\u2019s all.Then, there was a quiet knock on the door.\u201cIt\u2019s Uross, my lord.\u201dHe forced his dark, disheveled minds away.\u201c\u2026come in.\u201dHe managed to understand the low voice, and the door opened without a sound.\u201cWe have a visitor.\u201dEverything was annoying now. He answered promptly without looking away.\u201cSend them back.\u201dBut the butler did not budge and spoke once more.\u201cIt is Hyperion.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt was Helios whom he met for the first time after he got married. What should he do when he\u2019s not ready to face Helios peacefully yet. If he could, he wanted to avoid it forever.But.\u201c\u2026Let them in.\u201dThe lingering attachment that I couldn\u2019t bring to an end made him seem like a fool.After a while, a tall man in a black robe appeared.\u201cKael.\u201dTo be honest, Helios was shocked. Kaelus thought he was a friend who celebrated marriage by hugging. However, in just a few days, his face revealed nothing. Only then did he dare to guess the size of the wound that his old friend had hidden inside.The silver hair on the sofa crept up. The voice of the parched Kaelus rang.\u201cAre you enjoying your new marriage?\u201d\u201d\u201c\u2026I want to ask you.\u201dHelios slumped into his seat.\u201cAre you really\u2026 married?\u201dKaelus, whom he knew, was a very cold-hearted man. He was never such an impulsive person to commit the act of marriage.Suddenly he heard laughter.\u201cWhy? You thought you\u2019d be the only one getting married?\u201d\u201cDid you think carefully? She looked pretty suspicious.\u201dKaelus burst out laughing at the concern of his old friend, who was so kind.\u201cWhat\u2019s the point of being careful about life?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dHelios was ridiculous. Was he saying that the Kaelus in front of him was really him?\u201cKael, what the hell does that\u2026.\u201d\u201cI was going to die.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHelios froze where he was. On the other hand, Kaelus\u2019 expression remained calm as always.\u201cShe was the one who interrupted it. She used her foresight to break into my room. It\u2019s a shame.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe purple eyes were just as transparent as a glass egg.\u201cI just gave her what she wanted because she wanted to get married. That way, it won\u2019t be a bother.\u201dHelios read the extreme resignation from his friend\u2019s eyes. Instinctive questions that had not been asked popped out.\u201cWhy\u2026 \u2026didn\u2019t you tell me\u2026?\u201d\u201c?\u201dKaelus looked at him in wonder. What did he have to say?The golden eyes of Helios slowly fluttered.\u201cIf you\u2019ve suffered so much..\u2026 I wish you\u2019d told me earlier!\u201dKaelus chuckled.\u201cYeah. Everything is my fault.\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe long silver hair shook greatly as Kaelus rose to his feet, raising a cool air.\u201cIt was all my fault that I loved, that someone died, and that I was eventually devastated. It\u2019s all the consequences of me being bad.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean devastated?\u2026!\u201dHelios was in a daze. Something was wrong. He was sure Kaelus wished him happiness with a warm smile!Meanwhile, Kaelus continued to mutter as if possessed.\u201cIt\u2019s all my fault. I was stupid. I was stupid. What am I doing alive? Everything I do\u2026!\u201dHe couldn\u2019t breathe for a moment due to the sudden surge of pain. Kaelus pressed his chest with great urgency.\u201cOh my god\u2026!\u201d\u201cKael!\u201dHelios was horrified. He rushed up and cried out to help Kaelus.\u201cUross!\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026.\u201dKaelus waved his hand hard, but Uross, who was outside, appeared like a monster.\u201cMaster!\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026 I told you\u2026.\u201d\u201cButler! Where\u2019s the doctor?\u201dThe loud noise of the two made Kaelus\u2019 head throb. Fortunately, his breathing soon stabilized.\u201cUgh\u2026 It\u2019s noisy\u2026. Uross, get out.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat? Does this house put Helios\u2019 words before mine?\u201dHe was angry at the hesitant Uross. Uross immediately bowed his head and backed down.\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cGet out.\u201dThe butler was thrown out without saying another word.Helios was fed up with the cold attitude of Kaelus.\u201cKael\u2026.\u201d\u201cSigh, this is what happens when you come unexpectedly.\u201dHelios managed to speak to Kaelus, who was muttering bitterly.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m sorry. I really didn\u2019t know anything\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKaelus snorted lightly. Helios apologized again.\u201cI\u2019m sorry for what I just said. I was careless.\u201dCold relief went over his eyes.\u201cJust tell me what you want. Oh, did you come to confirm my marriage?\u201dKaelus walked slowly to the desk. Helios\u2019 dull voice behind his back.\u201cNo, the problem is\u2026 That\u2019s enough. Because I knew you really married her.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cAnd that she actually had the power of prophecy. I got a call last night that a troubled thief was caught, as she promised.\u201d\u201cYeah. So?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios was speechless for a moment. That face that looks like everything is wrong. It was completely unimaginable with the original Kaelus.\u201c\u2026\u2026 No, nothing. I had no reason to doubt.\u201dHelios finally realized for sure. The woman who claimed to be Kaelus\u2019 companion was truly a savior who saved him.I had to correct my first impression of Hestia. She wasn\u2019t just a nymph who hid her insidious innermost thoughts and approached Caelus.Kaelus\u2019 eyes suddenly blurred.\u201cActually, I know it will be okay.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dKaelus struggled to smile at his staring friend.\u201cIt was my pride. I just need you two to be happy, and I\u2019ll be comfortable soon\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI was able to face my true feelings only when I was pushed to the edge of the cliff. It\u2019s completely jagged. I didn\u2019t have a clue how to hold on. So, finally, I decided I\u2019d rather die.\u201dHelios\u2019 mouth didn\u2019t hastily open. Kaelus\u2019 voice continued.\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m disappointed that I survived unexpectedly. It\u2019s not easy to make that resolution again. But thanks to you, I realized something. Let\u2019s be more honest with ourselves from now on.\u201dKaelus\u2019 lips, which were smiling, twisted faintly.\u201cSo, let me tell you in advance. I won\u2019t be able to laugh with you and Diana anymore.\u201dHelios closed his eyes tightly. A declaration that we could never go back to the same old relationship. What he had been determined to do since he got Diana finally became a reality.But if, on that day, Kaelus really went wrong.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s okay, Kael. I\u2019m truly glad you\u2019re alive.\u201dHe still didn\u2019t like Hestia. But if it weren\u2019t for her, he and Diana would have to live with a guilt that they\u2019d never erase. For that alone, he should thank Hestia.Kaelus laughed lonesomely.\u201cThank you for thinking so.\u201dHelios left Kaelus\u2019 room helplessly. The waiting Uros bowed deeply.\u201cI\u2019ll take you outside.\u201dThere was a moment of silence while walking. Then Helios spoke cautiously.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me about Kael? Was it the Marquis\u2019 decision?\u201d\u201cThat has never been officially ordered. But if Lady Hestia didn\u2019t tell you when she saw you, she must\u2019ve considered both your highness and your position.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHelios asked again, thinking of something.\u201cIs Kaelus getting along well with that woman, Hestia?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not happy with it. But we recognize her as another master of this family.\u201dUross answered honestly.Helios again had to revise his assessment of Hestia. He didn\u2019t even know she was a lot more formidable than he thought.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll send them a wedding gift sometime soon.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s amazing, Your Grace. The masters will be pleased.\u201dUross thanked him politely.Diana greeted Helios, who had returned from his covert activities.\u201cHow was the Marquis?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHelios\u2019 expression was not very bright. Diana\u2019s heart was filled with anxiety.\u201cWas there a problem?\u201d\u201cKaelus is\u2026.\u201dHe couldn\u2019t believe it was so hard to bring up. Helios was at a loss where to begin to release his heavy heart.Diana\u2019s fine eyebrows were slightly distorted.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026 On the day we got married, Kaelus tried to kill himself.\u201d\u201c!\u201dDiana\u2019s heart sank. Although she harshly criticized Kaelus, she didn\u2019t want him to die like Princess Letona.\u201cIt was the Marchioness who prevented it from happening. She knew in advance with her foresight. Thanks to her, Kaelus lived.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dLooking at Diana, who was speechless, Helios\u2019 gold eyes sank heavily.\u201cI need to find out more about Hestia. Diana, it\u2019s not normal.\u201d\u201cIn what sense?\u201dDiana asked, feeling constrained. Dark anxiety, which could not be accurately identified, continued to attack her.Helios\u2019 eyes sharpened.\u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say for sure. First, we need to find out what the real purpose of Hestia\u2019s marriage to Kaelus is.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes.\u201dDiana could do nothing else but rely on him. Helios was the only one she can trust.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 2": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH ss - 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dDiana sat in front of the dressing table and sighed for a long time.It\u2019s been a long day.She was so nervous not to ruin the tea party that her fatigue came flooding in.And Hestia.\u201c\u2026.\u201dDiana looked at herself in the mirror with red eyes.It was the first time that my self-esteem collapsed like today. Hestia attacked Diana as if she had been waiting for the day to come. At a time when the objective status of Kaelus\u2019 spouse alone is burdensome.It was regrettable that she could not arrange her seat at another table due to her status as a marquis\u2019 wife.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201dWhen she thought of Hestia\u2019s black eyes, tears welled up again.Her heart always felt tight when she was facing her. It was better when she had Heli.But on this day, when she was being bitten by Hestia in front of people, he was not there.The court ladies removed Diana\u2019s accessories and undressed her dress with measured hand gestures. Diana stayed still like a doll.\u201cLet\u2019s go to the bathroom, your highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dDiana walked slowly, her lips clenched.The royal couple\u2019s dinner table.Helios looked across at his wife, who was nibbling on food.\u201cDiana, you did a great job today.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re welcome.\u201dHe forced her to smile once, and then she put on no expressionless again. Diana\u2019s depression was painting the surrounding air.Helios sighed heavily.\u201cWould you tell me in detail? What Hestia said at the party earlier.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dDiana paused her hand.A heavy silence enveloped them.\u201c\u2026Heli.\u201d\u201cYes, Diana.\u201dSeeing her companion, who responded without hesitation, Diana finally plucked up courage and took off her lips.\u201cI feel like my heart is falling apart. I can\u2019t get my act together.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHelios sensed that Diana\u2019s condition was unusual.At the same time, resentment against Hestia flared up. How dare you, my dear wife!Diana\u2019s eyes filled with tears before she knew it.\u201cHeli, am I really wrong?\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cWas morality, which I believe in, a complete illusion? Am I not supposed to blame Kaelus?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHelios could not immediately respond.The morality that Diana adheres to remains unquestionable. But if you ask him about criticizing Kaelus.He couldn\u2019t bear to say \u2018You didn\u2019t do anything wrong\u2019.Diana\u2019s gaze fell down.\u201cThe marchioness told me a story. It happened in that street. A woman murdered a young boy, who turned out to be the criminal who raped her daughter.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cThen she asked me. Is she really an immoral person?\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dA heavy silence fell again.Helios finally realized. How Hestia attacked Diana.It\u2019s very clever, isn\u2019t it? How could you shake the faith that Diana had kept firmly with a few words?It is not difficult to guess why Hestia did so. None other than Kaelus, who naturally says she loves him.\u201cDiana.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve never thought about this before. But why are you so shaken by Hestia\u2019s words today?\u201dDiana was not quick to answer his question. In fact, she didn\u2019t even know. Why are you so intimidated by Hestia?\u201cI don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just, the marquis\u2019 wife makes my heart race.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dLikewise, Helios felt heavy in his chest as if a lump of stone was in it. The direct cause was definitely Hestia, but there was also an indirect cause.It\u2019s Kaelus.A friend who wandered in despair alone while he and Diana dreamed of a happy future. Kaelus, who encountered Helios at the palace, did not give him a glance and passed with Hestia\u2019s hand.Helios lost a friend who spent most of his life with him.His mouth opened rather impulsively.\u201cDiana, should I apologize to Kael?\u201d\u201c!\u201dDiana glanced up at Helios.Apologize to Kaelus? Then should and admit that her accusation is wrong?\u201cHeli\u2026!\u201dIn fact, she wanted Helios to tell her firmly that she\u2019s not wrong.In an instant, disappointment flooded in.She wanted him to tell her that Hestia\u2019s accusations were groundless. She wanted him to nail down that the justice and morality that Diana believes in is absolute.\u201cYou can\u2019t do that.\u201dDiana flatly refused.Then Helios spoke earnestly to her.\u201cYou and I, we have to throw away the burden of our hearts. Kael is suffering greatly because of us. We owe him a debt. Diana.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not his fault that I\u2019m in pain. It\u2019s because of Marchioness Hestia!\u201dAn almost shouting voice.Helios was lost in thought.\u201cDiana, she did it for you. You considered him a friend, too. Why are you so cold?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a human being who believes in morality and justice before I\u2019m a friend of Kael. What he did wrong was wrong. If you forgive him for being our friend once, and compromise one by one like that, how can justice stand right in the world?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t you just understand him? As a result, we all got a lot of help from Kael. If he hadn\u2019t brought down the Duke Orcus, you and I wouldn\u2019t be so happy right now.\u2026!\u201d\u201cWho forced him to help like that? Kael could have chosen the right way! If he didn\u2019t make the Duchess die, there would have been other ways!\u201dI\u2019m right. I\u2019m not wrong. Diana reiterated her argument.Tears rolled down her cheeks before she knew it.\u201c\u2026 So, Kael is\u2026 Why did you do that?\u2026. Why do you have to abandon him?\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dInstead of persuading her more, Helios quietly shut up.Why was Diana so stubborn? Even though it\u2019s a lifelong belief, she knows it\u2019s faulty, too.In the face of a crisis in which she had to deny her life itself, Diana instinctively threw a hard armor around her.No matter what she says immediately, her heart will not open.Helios sat alone in his study after eating.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dStraight Diana. His precious love, who never forgets the righteousness of man.Diana served as a solid pillar for Helios, who had lived in various struggles and wars, to hold him.But now it wasn\u2019t just a pleasure.\u201cHestia, is it\u2026.\u201dHe still didn\u2019t know her real purpose. Just for sure, she hates them very much.The reason for pushing Diana at the tea party was also elegantly wrapped in Kaelus\u2019 honor, but in fact, it must have been because of something more so.To be honest, I was angry with Hestia. On the one hand, however, he acknowledged her argument. Kaelus\u2019 cruelty was not an easy matter to judge by moral standards.So he tried to persuade Diana. Although he failed to look good.Helios himself was like this, so what would other nobles do? Perhaps most were persuaded by Hestia\u2019s arguments.\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dA bitter monologue popped out.\u201cNo, what? \u2018I love him?\u2019 Did you know that such a sly woman could love?\u201dHestia\u2019s words were very annoying.The black woman, who doesn\u2019t seem to know what love is, loves not anyone else, but Kaelus? Hasn\u2019t he already been badly burned by love!Helios called in a sudden surge of displeasure.\u201cZenon, bring the brandy.\u201dThe faithful servant who was called rushed to fetch the drink. Then, as the owner usually enjoys, he put it in cold ice water and handed it over.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAs soon as the glass was put into his mouth and the alcohol was spilled, the cold drink went down his neck. Only then did the fire that had been rising from the inside calm down a little.Helios asked quietly.\u201cJennon, how was Diana\u2019s party today?\u201d\u201cThat is, Your Highness. It didn\u2019t sound very pleasant.\u201dA careful answer. Helios raised one eyebrow.\u201cTell me the details.\u201dZenon bowed his head apologetically and spoke about the concept of the tea party and the reaction of the aristocracy. While listening, Helios\u2019 expression gradually subsided.When Diana was preparing for the party, I knew there was a conflict with Madame Merope, the maid of honor. Still, I didn\u2019t think Merope would pull out completely, but unexpectedly, the goal with Diana seemed to have deepened.He should have looked more carefully. Helios regretted it belatedly.An involuntary question.\u201cWhat did the marchioness say?\u201dEven after mentioning it, he was slightly dumbfounded. Of all things, Hestia. Why would he care about her reaction?Zenon answered faithfully again this time.\u201cShe was impressed by the fact that they prepared nostalgic refreshments. And she asked the Crown Princess about Madame Merope\u2019s future.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios seemed to stand on tiptoe. Isn\u2019t that an incredible experience for a woman who has just entered the aristocratic society?You have to pull yourself together.Instinctively felt a danger signal.You can\u2019t trust Hestia. You shouldn\u2019t keep her close.But her ability, her foresight, confused Helios. If he couldn\u2019t trust her, what\u2019s the point of having her around?\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dHe hated himself for not being able to make a decision at once.Helios drank a glass of wine roughly in his hand.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Fortunately, it didn\u2019t break, but the tea splashed here and there.Zenon, the caretay of the lily palace, quickly approached, removed the teacup and cleaned the table. In the meantime, Helios, the crown prince, who served him, stomped his feet to the window angrily.Damn it. She\u2019s the one again.Looking out the window, he saw a woman with black hair walking leisurely. Hestia.Helios wanted to tear his tight chest apart with his hands.He already had a headache because of Madame Merope, but that black woman bothered it again and left.Diana, Merope, and Hestia.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dTo be honest, he didn\u2019t know who the anger was directed at. It could be directed at the sly Hestia, or it could be targeted at stubborn Merope and Diana.Either that or you can\u2019t do this or that in the middle.\u201c\u2026.\u201dYeah, that\u2019s the answer. He was so angry with himself that he couldn\u2019t control himself.And when it was so frustrating, his friend, who was like an alter ego, was always with him.\u201cKael\u2026.\u201dAnger and sadness flared.His friend, white with bitter eyes.I missed you so much.The friction between Diana and Madame Merope wasn\u2019t that bad at first.Diana invited fellow aristocrats to her first party, whom she became close to while dating Helios. At the time, Madame Merope fully reflected Diana\u2019s intentions, leading to a tea party with the atmosphere she wanted.The problem was after that. A large tea party attended by almost all noble ladies in the capital.In fact, it was an event that Diana herself was not very happy with. The old ladies were always a thorny force for Diana, a hotbed of authoritarianism and luxury, which she morbidly disliked.But if you can\u2019t avoid it, you have to face it. Diana decided to turn the burdensome meeting place into a declaration of her faith.Madame Merope vehemently opposed her intentions.Merope\u2019s idea was that the tea party should mean nothing more than a meeting. In addition, as Diana was the first royal family to serve powerful nobles, it was absolutely unacceptable to undermine their dignity.And yet, in the end, the tea party went as Diana intended. Madame Merope was ashamed of herself and has since taken her hands off the main duties of the palace.Merope had been protecting the palace even before Helios was born. As soon as Helios heard that Merope was so heartbroken that he went to her room with regret.She grabbed Helios\u2019 hand with tears in her eyes.\u201cI always pray to God that you will be a saint. God will take care of you without me.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, without you!\u201dHelios was quite shocked.Merope was like his aunt. Instead of the empress who passed away early, she was a person who took care of Helios until he grew up. She was always loyal to the imperial family and was proud of what she was doing.When the dead Duke of Orcus reached out with darkness, Madame Merope was one of the few people in the palace whom the emperor and Helios trusted completely.Helios tried to persuade her somehow, but it was not enough. Merope never budged.She was a truly loyal person. Until the end, she did not blame Diana for leaving the palace.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dHelios unbuttoned a couple of shirts and buried himself in the sofa. But his heart was still stuffy.\u201c\u2026.\u201dRecently, it has become increasingly difficult to open up to Diana.The fact that he loved her did not change. Diana\u2019s smile and body temperature still heated up Helios.However, the differences could not be narrowed on issues such as Kaelus and Madame Merope. Diana never compromised on what she believed was right.Of course, Diana was right. In any way, Diana\u2019s argument was more justifiable. Nevertheless, Helios was heartbroken. It would be nice if she would take a step in the framework of compassion and tolerance, not right or wrong, for once.And Hestia pointed out this very point sharply.She pointed to the phenomenon in which even the crown prince Helios failed to persuade Diana and repeatedly backed down, saying, \u2018It\u2019s a matter of authority within the palace.\u2019To be honest, he felt dirty. He could have just said once or twice that he had given way to Diana, but he couldn\u2019t properly refute it as if he had been hit in the stomach.In the realization that maybe it\u2019s true.\u201cDiana\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t like Hestia criticizing his wife on everything. It could be dismissed as deliberately nitpicking.However, the words she threw meaningfully bothered him.\u201cDidn\u2019t Diana say anything?\u201d\u201cDiana had to tell me something\u2026?\u201dHestia was a very thoughtful person. She never threw words out casually.Tied the emperor\u2019s recovery and Diana together, suggesting that Diana was hiding something from Helios. In addition, that was the content of Hestia\u2019s prophecy.Diana\u2019s secret. And the prophecy of Hestia.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut until this day, Diana treated him with a perfectly calm smile, without any sign of discomfort. Like there\u2019s no secret she\u2019s hiding.\u201cDamn it!\u201dHe hated this situation of having to doubt his beloved wife. In addition, Hestia, who made him do this, was annoyed.Still, we must not avoid it. This reality that Helios is facing now was a significant event that depended on the health of the emperor and the survival of the country, beyond just emotional problems with his wife.\u201c\u2026Zenon, where is Diana now?\u201dThe servant, who stood by his master silently, immediately replied.\u201cShe is meeting with the ministers of the temple in the drawing room. It\u2019s been scheduled for a long time.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201dFor some reason, I felt better.Diana had strong colleagues who supported her beliefs. But what about him now?\u201c\u2026 Tell Diana. When the gentlemen go back, come to my room.\u201d\u201cI see, Your Highness.\u201dThe faithful Zenon took orders immediately.\u201cHeli.\u201dDiana appeared like a light flower. Helios greeted her with a smile.\u201cDid all the retainers go back?\u201d\u201cYes, but what\u2019s the matter? I can\u2019t believe you called me like this while you were at work.\u201dIn fact, Diana was secretly nervous. It just so happened that Zenon had told me that Hestia had just gone and Helios was in a very low mood.The snake-like woman must have said something that bothered him again. She must be the reason why she was called.But contrary to her concerns, Helios smiled softly.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. I\u2019m just worried if you\u2019re getting too worked up these days.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s okay. If you\u2019re in a high position, you have a lot of work to do. You can\u2019t be lazy.\u201dThere was no particular sign, either. Helios\u2019 heart grew heavier and heavier.After pondering how to speak, he opened his mouth carefully.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to ask you this favor again, but\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201dDiana opened her sea-colored eyes wide. the expression of a husband who seemed apologetic for some reason.\u201c\u2026Can\u2019t you use more healing force on the father? He doesn\u2019t seem to be feeling very comfortable yet.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dDiana\u2019s expression clouded up in an instant.They were already in the process of healing in the morning and evening. By this point, the emperor should have been fine and running around. However, it was not easy to return to his former self.She nodded her head with great effort.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you again in the morning. Don\u2019t worry too much.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re not pushing yourself too hard, are you?\u201d Or maybe you\u2019ve lost your power.\u2026.\u201dDoubt, that Helios managed to bring up.But Diana laughed as if he were joking.\u201cIt didn\u2019t happen. His majesty will recover soon.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201dWill it be buried like this? Helios was momentarily conflicted.And in the end.\u201c\u2026really\u2026?\u201d\u201c!\u201dDiana was heartbroken. It was Helios who never expressed doubt, but why this time?No way, that woman..Hestia, who had been there a while ago, flashed into her head. The woman who foretold that her divine power would soon disappear.Should I tell you? About your future?Yeah, the prophecy could be wrong. What are you going to do if it isn\u2019t?But not yet.A bit more time.Let\u2019s wait a little longer.Sooner or later.\u201c\u2026Heli, don\u2019t doubt the power of God. Please.\u201dFor as long as she can to hide.If she loses her ability, everyone will know everything.So until then.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was a moment of suffocating tension.But soon the tension broke with Helios\u2019 voice.\u201c\u2026Yes, Diana.\u201dDiana stood up with a grin as soon as the tension fell.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go to his majesty right away.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dHis answering voice was somewhat chilling.\u201cZenon.\u201d\u201cYes, Your Highness,\u201d\u201cI need to see Kaelus. Just the two of us without Hestia.\u201d\u201cWill the marquis agree?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make him sure he does.\u201dThe golden eyes of Helios sank coldly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt first, I believed it was a vivid dream. I drifted off while rereading a romance novel that I indeed had completed before. When I opened my eyes, an unfamiliar place was brought into view. No, to be honest, it wasn't unfamiliar since this place was none other than a novel I had read.It was a really peculiar experience.It was a novel and not a novel at the same time. To put it another way, this place is obviously fictional, but in reality, it has become a reality that touches my skin **.**(\ud53c\ubd80\uc5d0\u00a0\uc640\ub2ff\ub2e4/I can feel it on my skin= to realize/sink in)From that day onwards, I enjoyed the story that felt more graphic than VR. Fortunately, the wealth I had was abundant for no reason; therefore, I poured all this money generously into achieving good things.In order to see the main characters up close, I bought the status of the Fallen Nobility with money in advance to enter the noble's gathering. How excited I was as a true fanatic to witness all of the main characters passing by in front of me.First of all, the female lead, as described in the novel, has long pink hair with a subtle pearly hue. Bright eyes with a mysterious mixture of blue and green, like the color of the sea at Hyeopjae Beach **. Perhaps it was because she was the most beautiful woman in this world. Wherever she strolled, light powder seemed to scatter. As the role of providing the strongest cider ** in the novel, she was very bold.**\ud611\uc7ac/Hyeopjae= Beach on Jeju Island in Korea**\uc0ac\uc774\ub2e4/cider= Famous drink similar to sprite, a slang for satisfaction and refreshingness that we can feel when an injustice situation is solvedIt was a minor abrasion to my fortune, but after paying a considerable donation and meeting the saint, it was truly worth the money.There are also another two individuals who had no choice but to rank first place in the beauty rankings along with the heroine.The male lead, a Crown Prince, who is a dignified man, and his best friend, a young marquis, a sub-male lead who acts as a barrier between the male lead and the female lead.The male lead perfectly fulfilled the demands of black-haired male maniacs. A combination of black hair and golden eyes. In addition, just as though he was the best man in the world view of a movie, he had a body if it was a body, a head if it was a head **and even his innate status as the crown prince. It was a character that the writer was resolved and written solely the best.**\ubab8\uc774\uba74\u00a0\ubab8,\u00a0\uba38\ub9ac\uba74\u00a0\uba38\ub9ac/body if it was a body, a head if it was a head= ?The opposite of the crown prince is my sub-male lead. Although he was initially cold-hearted and would sometimes create cruel decisions for his own sake, he was the sweetest man in the world when it came to the heroine. And in spite of his desperate love for the woman, he was an unfortunate man who was not selected by the female lead in the end.The original plot was as follows.Diana was a saint with healing powers referred to as divine power. A great priestess of the gods who always offers devotion by the side of the powerless. Her heart was as beautiful as her looks, and she was named the only hope in an empire where all kinds of greed and trickery were rampant.There were two men who yielded their hearts to her. Crown Prince Helios and his best friend, Marquis Caelus. The two men, through their position and their fortune, assisted her side by side and supported her in making the world a better place.\"Diana, you are always right. I will join you.\"\"Don't forget that I'm always behind you, Diana.\"Of course, there were also villains who defied the protagonists. Mainly The Duke of Orcus, the head of the nobility, and his daughter, Princess Letona. He was a typical villain who would not hesitate to commit unscrupulous crimes for their own benefit. As the protagonists confronted them, the love and love triangle of the three main characters deepened. The villain Letona, who opposes the heroine, tormented Diana. She was supported by an influential family that was not afraid of the emperor together with a desire to marry Helios and become the future empress.Her words were as followed, \"Doesn't the noblest of the blood befit the noblest of the Empire? Unlike this woman with low blood.\"\"If the Empire does not wish for the Duke of Orcus to establish a new principality, you will have to accept this marriage, Your Majesty.\"The emperor's authority was shaken without mercy by the interference of the nobles. Hence, the Crown Prince was coerced into an undesirable marriage over the woman he loved. In the end, the sub-male lead didn't hesitate to release the gun ** as soon as he discovered evidence of the crimes his duchess had committed for his friends and loved ones.**\ucd1d\ub300\ub97c\u00a0\uba68\ub2e4/release the gun= to take on a common task that no one is reluctant to take on as a representative.\"The only way to uproot the duke's villainy is now. The imperial family might face a counterattack if they come forward. Hence, this time I have no choice but to move alone.\"Here, the decisive reason why the sub-male lead was not chosen by the female lead appeared. It was the duke and his daughter who drank the poison on their own. Although they ended their lives by suicide, the sub-male lead had exterminated them regardless.The female lead fiercely criticized the behavior of the sub-male lead. It was the decision of the sub-male lead who cut off the buds in advance ** for fear that the daughter of the Duke and Duchess of Haengnyeo would receive only lenient punishment and would face the prince and the saint again, but the heroine rebuked this as cruel and immoral. Moreover, she pointed out, it is clear that he, who was only her marquis, allowed the duke and princess to die at will.**\ubbf8\ub9ac\u00a0\uc2f9\uc744\u00a0\uc798\ub77c\ub0c8\ub358/cut off the buds in advance= the problem must be prevented before it becomes more serious\"Caelus! How can you force someone to choose death on their own? What a vicious way to punish them...! Besides, you have neither right to do that!\"Consequently, the female lead completely turned her back on the sub-male lead. The villain's death restored the peacefulness of the empire, and the novel concluded with a happy marriage between the female lead and male lead.The decisive factor that made this romance-fantasy novel, a famous romance, was the charm of the male and sub-male lead, regardless of what anyone said. The dignified and incredible Helios and the thoughtful and gentle Caelus. The author divided the readers' attention by showing the standard of a strong female lead, Diana, who pours out unrelenting work toward the nobles even though she is a commoner, the tsundere male lead, and the friendly sub-male lead. The readers expressed that it was too insensitive to choose just one person, so some commented that they should instead make it a reverse harem.Unfortunately, I was one of those people who favored the sub-male lead. I was also firmly afflicted with the sub-male lead disease, which some Rofan readers are prone to.Even at the end of the novel, the marriage between the female protagonist and the crown prince, I still haven't given up my affection for Caelus. You have no idea how much it touched my heart while reading the ending. Our sub-male lead said he would also be happy afterward, meeting a good person who acknowledges his sincerity so that he can forget the heroine and start over.More than a year had passed since I entered the beginning of the novel, and by the time I saw the ending. I witnessed the wedding ending between the Crown Prince and the Queen with a lamentable heart. With a generous amount of money, I attended their wedding party.A sub male lead who wishes happiness for the two of them with a lovely smile. I looked at him with a melancholy heart more than anyone else.Be sure to be happy. You must be happy.You're wise, so you should not dwell on a passing first love for too long. Please get over the despair of this shattered heart, get up, and live your life proudly.I secretly begged and begged.To be honest, I presumed transmigrating into the novel to be a long dream. So, after witnessing the ending, I thought I would have to return to my real world. No, the story is over, so there's no reason for me to be here any longer. I'm a person who still has a lot of work to do in reality!!But to my surprise, I opened my eyes again to this novel. I was perplexed because I had no way of knowing why I was still not released from this possession. I went out into the street to find any clues. Instead, I heard the news that came along with the blue sky.My dear sub-male lead Caelus was said to take his own life.His eyes were puffy, and his throat was sobbing. My dearest passed away in extreme despair without receiving any comfort from anyone.I never wanted an ending like this. He should have lived well. He should have lived his life bravely, letting go of his shattered heart. There were no longer any regrets left in this world. He couldn't hate the couple, the female and male leads, who forced him to turn his back on the world. The affection I had for them when I was a reader of the novel vanished like smoke. I never forgave Diana and Helios for abandoning Caelus.I couldn't even open my eyes to reality. Life in the novel continues without any meaning. In the meantime, I have to work randomly to avoid starvation while collecting the backstories of the main couple.After becoming the Crown Princess, the healing power of the saintess gradually weakened. The most substantial justification for making her the companion of the crown prince gradually relinquished her authority. The couple's bean pods **, which made them only look at each other, were peeled off little by little. The fiery love between the two main characters lasted less than two years at most. It's a love that subsides so quickly.**\ubd80\ubd80\uc758\u00a0\ucf69\uae4d\uc9c0\ub3c4/couple's bean pod= an idiom similar to love is blind/blind love. Basically, one falls in love with the other person and is blinded by that person's flaws. It contains negative nuances, i.e., even though no one sees it at all, if you fall into the illusion that you met by yourself, or if you are struggling with your heart, people around you may say that you were covered with bean pods. In this context, I would say both male and female leads uncover their love illusion of each other and finally realizes their flaws.Then, what the hell did my beloved give up his life for? My whole life was filled with nothingness and wrath.I had lived a life of no regrets, so I couldn't take good care of my health. One day when I was sick enough to die, I clenched my teeth and headed to the temple. I collected all the last remaining money and asked the priest. Please let me see the saintess just once.But the priest replied that he could no longer allow the saintess, who had now sat on the highest throne, to meet with a lowly person like me. Saintess Diana, the priestess of the temple and a friend of the ordinary people, no longer existed.I just lost my reason. I ran into any small room used as a place of prayer. I closed the door tightly and screamed immorality to the god who created this world and the writer of the novel.Save my beloved!I have been living without even knowing why I possessed this world, and my only hope that somehow managed to continue this meaningless life, my favorite, Caelus, died.Either save him or kill me. Please do something.So I cried and cried again until I was exhausted and collapsed. And at that moment, a miracle happened. I collapsed in the temple and opened my eyes again.Unbelievably, I met my favorite, Caelus.--------------------[T/N: Hello, nice to see you reading.

No, there isn't anyone among the priests that will carry me back home. They don't even know who I am, and even if they do, the priests aren't the type of people who are very idle that they inquire about the location of my house and carry me back quietly.I tilted my head and arose from my slumber...\"Ah......?\"My body felt light, and I couldn't feel any pain. It almost resembles a dying body since I never look after my health. I just feel like I woke yesterday. I felt recovered too? Wait, what? Recovered?As a romance-fantasy novels fan, it is the first thing that crosses my mind.It's impossible?! I raced back and forth to the desk. Since I entered the novel, I have carefully tracked the date. Wouldn't it be natural for fans who have reread the books for nth times to be curious about the timing of the happening of significant events?It's a bit overwhelming to think that my deteriorating body has been rejuvenated after only 1 or 2 years, and I no longer experience any pain.Isn't that enough grounds for my suspicions?\"!\"And again. The suspicion of the RoFan readers was correct. I have returned not just at the beginning of the novel but also just right at the end of the story.The novel's finale is the wedding ceremony between the female protagonist, Diana, and the male protagonist, Helios.I reflexively stared at the clock hanging on the wall. It was almost time for the wedding reception to come to an end. How can I return at such a perfect time?! Though suddenly, a question comes to mind. What on earth brings me here and why?However, I quickly shook my head violently to shake off my thoughts.\"I'll worry about that later...!\"Since Caelus died on the night of the wedding ceremony between the Crown Prince and his wife, therefore, this is now the timeline where Caelus is still alive!The sub-male lead of my favorite novel that I had missed very much. Caelus's pale, expressionless face and his neatly tied dazzling silver-white hair. Together with his mystifying violet eyes, which are rare in the world in this novel.The two years that I had endured alone after he passed away were utterly vain. To be honest, I have no regrets about this world anymore except to see the face of a living Caelus again.I didn't have to worry anymore about miscellaneous life here. I cannot let him die. Since I have travelled back in time like this, I must rescue my dearest .**\ucd5c\uc560\ub9cc/dearest= shortened form of\u00a0\ucd5c\uace0\ub85c\u00a0\uc560\uc815\ud558\ub294\u00a0means love the most.There is no need to worry about going against the original. Because, as of today, the novel has reached a complete ending, and after that, no other publications will be uploaded. Of course, this world is still a fictional world created by the author, but it is not the serialized part anymore.It's alright if I alter it! In other words, it can be said that it is a realistic secondary result.Will I be able to return to my real world after saving Caelus? I don't know. But even if I can't, today I shall prevent him.The reason Caelus was so heartbroken was none other than Diana. This is because she abandoned him due to his cruel and cold treatment during the process of exterminating the villain and her family, who were against Diana. Diana sternly criticized Caelus and turned her back on him with a cold shoulder.Is there anything more desperate than a loved one not knowing the actual truth?Was killing the villains as easy as eating a meal for Caelus?Couldn't he have expected that the denunciation would come back to him?Absolutely not. Caelus really wanted to keep Diana safe, even at the risk of everything.Only by removing this despair from his heart can Caelus be saved. My goal is not to make Diana, who was already married to her prince, remarry Caelus but to make her realize Caelus' sincerity that he had truly loved her. Ultimately, what I want is for Diana to deeply regret that she had dumped Caelus.If her Crown Prince, Helios, wooed Diana with his fiery passion, Cael wrapped her with his subtle warmth. Was it too warm that it just felt like comfortable air for Diana? She didn't end up saying thanks to Caelus.Shouldn't the Crown Prince couple be delighted? Yes. If you're delighted, it should be good for both of you.Despite that, when I know that there are people who become anguished and disheartened since the couple has turned their backs on the world behind that happiness, I think they shouldn't just walk the flowery path very effortlessly.After all, didn't Diana only walk on a solid road and cider path throughout the novel, thanks to the two men's utmost sincerity! So now it's time to take a sneak peek at the dirt road.Why should a woman's heart be inclined only to one man no matter what the other man does? If this had been real and not a novel, there would have been definitely a balance between the two outstanding men at least once.But now, the novel is over, and the woman who chose the male lead without any second thought was blinded by the crown prince buff and should've bear 'in-depth worries' about the disregarded love even if it's belatedly.Therefore, I will gladly take the role of 'villainess' in the story after the ending. There is no more bystander as a reader and an extra of the novel. From now on, I plan to actively intervene in this world and the relationship between the protagonists.Diana. I will take back all of the things you received from Caelus and the things you enjoyed because of Caelus. So I will make you realize how much Caelus has granted you in your life and how wild your accusations against him were.I drove a wagon the size of the palm of my hand and went frantically to the Marquis. Meanwhile, the sun had set entirely, and only the stars twinkled in the dim sky. It is truly a beautiful night, but there is no time to admire it.Finally arrived at Caelus's mansion, I jumped off the wagon like I was rolling. I recklessly grabbed the heavy iron gate and shook it.\"Hey, is there anyone? I have something to tell you!\"The gatekeeper appeared with an annoyed expression on his face.\"Don't make a fuss over here, at home, the lord of Illion, the lord of high status, Marquis Caelus.\"It's a lot of talk and nonsense, but now there's nothing to be offended by. Rather than revealing my identity, it is urgent first to confirm that Caelus is safe.\"I wonder if the Marquis has returned home? It's a crucial question!\"\"He had returned a little while ago. But his lordship\u00a0 won't be welcoming any more visitors.\"\"Then please call the butler! We need to check the safety of the Marquis right now!\"Perhaps due to my unusual tone, the gatekeeper glowered but entered the mansion anyway.\"Tsk! Wait a minute.\"Why does every minute feel long? I could no longer afford to stand still and wait for the gatekeeper to return.I set my feet on the iron gate of the mansion. I have been able to go beyond the school gate with my past skills.Oh, how did I reach so far! Even though I possessed it for about three years, I only realized it after returning today.It was a dark night with not even a moon in the sky. Oddly enough, no one stopped the stranger as they ran through the front yard.An inquisitive yet subtly eerie silence. Why isn't it like that sometimes? It's like something big is about to happen, like a bizarre silence for no reason. It was just that now.I knew where I was going to run. While the novel was ongoing, I spent a lot of money to find out advanced information that Caelus's bedroom was on the second floor. I passed the unlocked front door, opened it, and jumped up the colorful staircase in the center.Someone shouted,\"Are you the guy ?\"**\ub188\uc774\ub0d0/guy: a noun that means dude or guy. Informal words use commonly used for men. When combined with curse words can be slang words and bad words.It's a bitch , not a guy, but I can't afford to correct it.**\ub144\uc774/bitch: a noun for curse word implying that she's not a guy but a girlI saw the artist's butler in the middle of the hallway on the second floor. He exclaimed urgently,\"What about the Marquis?!\"**\uc791\uac00/artist: a noun that could also mean writers, singers, and painters. Here, the artist's butler is created by the original writer and the artist's butler.My running momentum was so fierce and ferocious that he turned the handle he was holding on to and opened the door.Almost at the same time, the butler and I entered the room.And at that moment, the sight caught my eye.\"!\"\"Caelus-nim!\"A shadow was holding up a dagger towards his chest. As if momentarily startled by the sudden intrusion, the shadow stopped moving and stiffened. I jumped in without hesitation and quickly slammed his hand, dropping the dagger he held onto the floor.\"... ... !\"The situation ended in an instant.He slumped down on the spot. By a hair's breadth , Camelus was saved.**\uac04\ubc1c\uc758\u00a0\ucc28\ub85c/hairbreadth: an idiom that literally means the distance between hairs, and since it's a very small distance hence could be defined here as by a small chance.\"... ... ..\"\"... ... ..\"\"... ... ..\"In the darkened room, the three of us stood silently, looking at each other. I, the butler, and my favorite, Caelus, who just saved my life.My hands trembled, and my heart pounded violently at the worst situation I had barely prevented. I'm panting and out of breath.\"... ... .What.\"It was an enraged voice. A voice was so cold that it made you flinch in an instant. These were the first words of Kailus towards me.But another me within myself cheered fiercely. My beloved spoke to me for the first time! Besides his long silver hair and a thin nightgown, he was wearing. A very sexy figure in front of me ripped his clothed chest open to insert a dagger.Even in the midst of this, this kind of thing caught my eye. It seems that I still haven't taken off my perspective as an extra.Anyway, I'll try to avoid the irritation that will come right away. I'll leave Caelus alone for now and bowed politely to the butler.\"... ..Please take good care of the Marquis.\"Then the butler, who came to his senses, hurriedly called me and stopped me.\"No, don't go back yet, and wait for a moment in a nearby room. Lady.\"He is indeed a savvy butler. Even if my attire is messed up by running over the iron gate and running through the perimeter, you can tell at a glance that I am an aristocrat.He quickly nodded his head.\"All right\"An experienced butler will take care of the rest.

I had organized my plan in my mind.The ultimate objective is to make Caelus no longer desire death and have the will to live a cheerful life. And to do this, I must first unravel the cause of his irreversible despair and wounds.To be honest, I do not want to objectively examine the causal relationship between the right and wrong of my favorite's action.

I stood up slowly, but the butler hesitated a bit and then lowered his head.\"I really don't know how to thank you. Thanks to you, I saved my master's life.......\"\"You're welcome. I'm glad it wasn't too late.\"\"Right now, Master Caelus's heart is very sensitive. Even if he says something harsh, please understand it with compassion.\"\"I will. Thank you for your concern.\"His words are sincere, perhaps because he was a butler who looked after Caelus, who lost his parents early as if he were his own child.I followed the butler and stood in front of Caelus' bedroom again.\"Master Caelus. I have brought the Lady.\"There was no answer from inside. But the butler pushed me into the chamber with a push.\"It's going to be very difficult. Still...\"\"Ah.....\"I understood immediately. Caelus has just attempted suicide. It isn't easy to expect such composure from him. He will probably pour out all sorts of hysteria onto me for disturbing him.Nevertheless, I have to face it. I blocked the tip of Caelus's sword right now, but if I want to continue living in the future, I must embrace the anguish that had stained him.To remove the shadow of death from Caelus, I\u00a0 have to set my feet with a firm resolve.\".........\"Caelus was sitting on the couch as I had imagined.His long silver hair dropped over his shoulder, and his mysterious violet eyes were like mineral gemstones. His loose-fitting clothes were still not adjusted properly.\"...What are you?\"There was no energy in his voice, but his cool voice leaked out. I stretched out my chest as if I was not frightened.\"My name is Hestia. Marquis Caelus.\"It's the first time that I have talked to the main characters in the novel. I would have wished for the atmosphere to be more pleasant if it was possible, but right now is the time to cover cold rice and hot rice .**\ucc2c\ubc25\u00a0\ub354\uc6b4\ubc25\u00a0\uac00\ub9b4\u00a0\ub54c\uc778\uac00/time to cover cold rice and hot rice= A literal translation of a proverb that could mean to get as many options as she can. Another similar yet different proverb,\u00a0\ucc2c\ubc25\u00a0\ub354\uc6b4\ubc25\u00a0\uac00\ub9b4\u00a0\ucc98\uc9c0\uac00\u00a0\uc544\ub2c8\ub2e4\u00a0is translated into beggars can't be choosers, which means people in need have to take whatever they can get and cannot be concerned about the quality if they cannot afford to buy it for themselves.\"It would have been a really, really bad thing. I'm glad the Marquis arrived before he got hurt. There are a lot of people who love and care about the Marquis, and everyone must have been very surprised. I am really relieved. Thank you so much for being safe.\"\"........\"Caelus's violet eyes locked into mine resentfully.My heart intensely pounded as I was sunk in those eyes. But I took a deep breath and began to explain my situation as calmly as possible.\"Anyhow, it must be very embarrassing to meet me all of a sudden...\"\"What do you want?\"\"...yes?\"My words to explain the situation in a lengthy way were cut off by a cold voice with no motivation in the world.\"I'm asking you, what do you want?\"\"...........\"What should I answer? Actually, I don't know either. Because the psychology of a person who has just been interrupted trying to end his life with his own hands is not an area I am very confident in.He was prepared to die painfully, but did he get angry because I stopped him? Or is he thankful to me for impulsively preventing something big from happening?But whatever it is, this man currently appears to be bothered by everything in front of him.His eyes, his attitude, and his voice were all evident, rather than asking in detail about the identity of an unexpected guest who broke into his space. The kind of atmosphere that he exuded was to get rid of me as soon as possible.In other words, even if it was a slightly unreasonable request, Caelus, who was in a very confused and exhausted state of mind and body, could roughly agree to anything.So I shouted.\"...I want to be a Marchioness.\"\"........\"His white expressionless expression was slightly distorted.Why am I so absurd? I suddenly became frustrated. I spoke back and forth.\"Well, I am making such an absurd request because I have one wish for the rest of my life, and the closer it is to Marquis Caelus, the more advantageous it is. If this is difficult for you, once you have me by your side as an aid and understand what kind of person I am....\"\"Do whatever you feel like.\"He replied with a dry voice.I was startled.\"Yes?\"Caelus stood up like a ghost. Then, as if everything was bothering him, he went into the bed and turned around, and lay down.I questioned my ears, suppressed my heart about to burst, and asked again.\"Do you really want me to be your spouse?!\"\"Call the butler. Talk to him about what you require.\" Lying on the bed with his back away from me, he replied bluntly.\"Ah........\"Apparently, it's real! Oh my goodness, how can you accept such an absurd confession so easily? Have you really given up on life? Are you crazy? Do you know who I am?!\"........\"But soon, a bitter and terrifying feeling swelled up in my heart. I think tears will come out anytime soon.Because that's true, Caelus really has completely given up his life.\"All right. I will meet the butler.\"\"........\"I backed away helplessly in front of him, but he never looked back at me.The butler was waiting for me right outside the door. I asked him with a bitter smile.\"Did you listen to the conversation we had inside?\"Unless there is perfect soundproofing, you must have heard it to some extent, but the butler of the marquis shook his head in an extremely respectful manner.\"I haven't heard anything, Lady.\"\"Then the story will be quite long. Can I talk to you for a moment?\"I asked him to talk. The butler said he understood and sent another servant into his room so that Caelus would not do something reckless again.\"Watch the Marquis make sure he's sleeping properly.\"\"Yes. Butler..\"The servant, who received the instructions, politely bowed his head and quietly entered Karus's room.\"Then the Lady will also go this way...\" I nodded and silently followed his lead into an empty room nearby.\"It's late, but let me introduce myself. My name is Hestia, the daughter of Lord Illea.\"He gave me the identity that I had paid in advance to make it easier for me to do it. In fact, the land called Illea was a small mountainous area, and on paper, the lord, who became my adoptive father, was almost like a beggar, even though he had the title of baron.When I decided to become his adopted daughter with a small amount of money, it was a contract with nothing but profit for each other.\"Oh, I see. Lady Hestia. Anyway, I have to say thank you again.\"After formal greetings, the butler bowed again.I hurriedly waved my hand.\"You're welcome. Rather than that, if you listen to what I say from now on, that feeling might disappear.\"I also decided to openly open my heart to the butler who truly cares for Caelus.He looked at him curiously.\"What are you trying to say...\"Unlike Caelus, who put his mind on the line, this butler is extremely sane. A tension different from the previous one squeezed my neck tightly.\"That's it. I know it's a bit reckless, but I asked Caelus a while ago that I wanted to become a Marchioness. The Marquis told me to discuss it with the butler without saying anything....\"\"!\"Without realizing it, I looked into his eyes like a criminal. As if incredulous, the middle-aged gentleman had his eyes wide open.\"Really... you mean that answer...?\"\"Of course, you can criticize me for taking advantage of the poor Marquis's state, but I have a clear plan to prevent the former Marquis from taking such extreme actions in the future. I made a request.\"\".........\"The butler was speechless. It is natural. How could he not be absurd when an unknown woman attacked in the middle of the night and said she would become the Marchioness? Perhaps this loyal butler is the more difficult hurdle to overcome than Caelus himself.\"You must be wondering how I got to know today. I know it's hard to believe, but the truth is...\" I cringed but convinced myself. From now on, I am a character in a novel. A character in a fantasy novel where unrealistic things happen countless times.\"...I have the ability to see the future. Not only today but also in the future.......\"\"!\"Seeing him with his mouth wide open makes me feel guilty for some reason. Still, acting is something you have to do for sure.\"Didn't the Marquis get the very precious pink diamonds in the past? With that, he must have wanted to make a present for Saintess Diana, who became His Majesty the Crown Princess today. In the end, he failed to actually give it as a gift.\"\"No, how!\"The butler was astonished. However, it is a fact that readers who have read the novel Nth times can't help but remember. Shall we guess the place where he kept the diamond?\"Perhaps the jewel is now stagnant in Marquis Caelus's library drawer. If you don't believe me, you can go and confirm it out now.\"--------------------[T/N: Just did this chapter before work, enjoy :) ]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHearing my confident words, the butler groaned a little.I continued speaking in a serious tone.\"Anyway, I have rushed here tonight for the Marquis, and I want to utilize this special ability that I have for him. I really have no intention of becoming the Marquis's companion. However, in public eyes, it can be regarded as the spouse of the Marquis. If you want me to write a written vow, I will gladly write it. I will never act as a real marchioness in this family. I will never do anything that will harm the Marquis.\"The appearance of discussing my favorite's marriage with someone other than the person himself is a bit absurd, but given the circumstances, it cannot be helped.As I poured out my words like a rapid-fire gun , my chest pounded mercilessly. Will my persuasion work? Will I be able to overcome the obstacle of 'the Marquis's butler'?**\uc18d\uc0ac\ud3ec/rapid-fire gun= literal translation for fast-talking style.Examining the person who didn't speak up easily, I added a little bit more.\"Didn't Crown Prince Helios also welcome a healer as his companion? It doesn't seem like a particularly strange sight for two best friends to have someone with special abilities next to them.\"This is the unreal world of fiction. A world where the unnatural likelihood is more reasonable than realistic reasoning. It's a bit reckless, but let's bet.Is this a sign that things are going well?The butler then looked at me and said,\"......To be honest, all of this is embarrassing, but since the one speaking is the same person who saved the Marquis' life, let's prepare the documents first. However, if you state your intention more clearly after the Marquis takes a deep breath and calms down, we will proceed with the procedure.\"I immediately agreed.\"Yes, I will wait.\"The butler nodded his head.\"It's too late to go home today. So for now, please sleep in this room. Lady Hestia, I'll see you tomorrow morning.\"After asking politely to the end, he stood up and left.\"Whew...\"When I was finally left alone, I let out a sigh.Would it be alright to do it like this? I had never been married before in both worlds, and I have ruined the milestones of my own life in this way.\"...Ahh. I don't know! Let it be as it should be, what.......\" as if to shudder off my anxiety, I muttered aloud.Actually, I didn't even want to get married. Initially, I wanted to start as an aide or a secretary of Caelus. I thought I would have to gain Caelus's trust.However, there is no desire to live within him. Once I catch those eyes, it seems that he could die again anytime.I stopped screaming at him when asked what I wanted. Rather than having a thorough plan, it was quite impulsive.But the feeling that it's better than that doesn't change.As I said to the butler, in order to be able to wield as much of Caelus's Marquis status as possible, it's best to become his spouse.It seems that I am pretending to be an oracle who sees the future, but I have to bring my love somehow back to life because that's my only purpose in this world.--------------------The following morning was bright.If you impulsively propose (?) to your favorite and wait for his approval, isn't it normal to be nervous and unable to breathe? Still, how can I be so carefree, funny, and bitter? I may still consider my marriage as someone else's as if reading a novel.But let's think seriously. Can 'Hestia' in this world really be 'me'?To be honest, I deny it. I'm only playing a role as a character named 'Hestia' that is appropriate for this novel, but I have never been immersed in this world as the main character. Here, my identity as 'extras in work' or 'reader of the original' is probably not very impactful even in the huge event of getting married to Caelus. But is this alright?\"Lady Hestia. \"\"Ah yes..!\"I stopped the thought of biting my tail and suddenly woke up to the call he heard. The marquise's butler has arrived. I hurriedly put the sheets together and sat down on the sofa. The door opened with a reasonable gap.**\uaf2c\ub9ac\ub97c\u00a0\ubb34\ub294\u00a0\uc0dd\uac01\uc744/thought of biting my tail= idiom that means overcrowded thoughts to depict regrets and feeling remorsed (?)\"Did you have a good last night?\"\"Yes, of course. Thank you.\"I also politely answered the butler who asked politely. The butler poured a fragrant tea and immediately put a thick pile of papers in front of me.\"Well, how is Marquis Caelus?\"The butler smiled softly at my question.\"Fortunately, nothing happened overnight. You claim to see the future, but it seems like it's hard to come up with something like this.\"\"Ah......\"Instantly, I was at a loss for an answer. However, I have to try to give an answer.\"That is.... because it's only focused on big events... ..\"\"Ho Ho Ho. It was a joke. But on the other hand, I think I have surprised you a little.\"\"Ha Ha Ha.......\"Damn. It didn't sound like a joke.The butler said, pointing to the stack of papers.\"I worked hard on it. These are the things that Lady Hestia must agree to become our Marquis's spouse.\"\"Whoa...\"In other words, this is a contract-marriage document.While I was rummaging through the papers, the butler quietly got up and left the room. It seems to be considerate of me, so I can examine it carefully.To be honest, I can't help but admire him. The butler is someone who truly cares for Caelus. To be honest, can he just live by getting paid on time and doing what he was asked to do as long as he gets paid? Even so, he does this carefully so that it does not ruin his owner's life.The contents of these documents were mostly about preventing me from arbitrarily exploiting Caelus's identity and the property of the Marquis. There was no reason for me to refuse. I signed in full agreement.It was also written about my rights as a Marchioness. If not dogmatic, I could use the same level of authority as Caelus himself. And there was the inclusion that a certain amount of money would be paid in the future. I almost agreed with all of the terms except the inheritance. Because I have no interest in Caelus's property. This was also the case when I signed a contract with my stepfather on paper, the lord of Elea.After reviewing the documents, I called the butler again.\"Most of them are signed agreements. But I won't take the inheritance. You don't want me to be misunderstood as a swindler trying to steal the marquis' property, do you?\"\"Ah. Is that so? Alright. Then, after Master Caelus has finished breakfast, we'll see together.\"The butler's tone was mild.--------------------After a while, I followed the butler to Caelus's bedroom. The room I entered was very dark with the curtains drawn.\"Marquis Caelus. I have brought Lady Hestia.\"\"............\"Caelus was sitting sideways on the sofa, looking disheveled as he had the day before. A face that is full of tiredness. He still appears dizzy. My heart ached.The butler gave me one glance and politely held out the papers in front of Kailus.\"As the Marquis said, I have prepared documents to acknowledge Lady Hestia as the spouse of the Marquis. The Lady has already signed hers. Now she only needs Marquis Caelus to sign it.\"\"...........\"Caelus stared at me, leaning back and moving only his eyes. If only his gaze was sharp. But unfortunately, his gaze was unfocused.His back slowly fell off the sofa. He signed with a pen, flicking through the last page of the paperwork. The butler looked at me with an apologetic look. Hence in less than 5 minutes, we got married.When he finished signing, he threw the pen away as if it were bothering him.\"All right. Get out.\"He said with an irritating tone. The unknown sorrow swelled. Still, I endured it and bowed down with a sullen attitude.\"Thank you. Marquis.\"\"............\"There is no response to my greetings. Without hesitation, I grabbed my papers and left the butler and bedroom.The butler bowed politely to me again.\"Lady Hestia. I wish you all the best in the future. Please save Master Caelus.\"This is the reason why the butler helped with the contract marriage by making documents without saying a word in order for Caelus to find the will to live again.\"I am the one taking care of you. But how should I address the butler?\"\"Ah, please call me Uros.\"Something feels strange. In the novel, he was known only as 'the butler of the Marquis' without a name, but when I heard his name like this, it was as if he had truly become my neighbor.**\u00a0\uc774\uc6c3/neighbor= a figurative speech to imply being closer like a neighbor\"I will gather the servants of the mansion soon. Say your greeting to the Marchioness...\"He quietly waved his hand.\"No. It's alright. You don't have to greet me. Like I said, I'm not here to be the owner of this mansion.\"\"Um. If that's the case... I'll show you the room you'll be staying in from now on.\"The butler was embarrassed, but he accepted my words without hesitation. A gentle attitude that is not overdone. I like it quite a bit.My room was at the end of the hallway, opposite Caelus's bedroom. It is as big and splendid as Caelus's room. It's like I'm feeling sad for some reason.However, if I ask that the night be decorated simply according to my taste, it will cause an unnecessary problem for the servants. I'll just leave it alone.\"Thanks, Uros. But I have to go out for a while. I had to bring my belongings from the house I used to live in.\"\"Then I will prepare the wagon.\"The butler immediately turned around.\"Whoa...\"I let out a small sigh and looked at the marriage certificate in my hand. Despite being a really delicate piece of paper, it is a weapon that will provide the greatest strength when dealing with Diana and Helios in the future.I walked over to the desk on one side of the bedroom and opened the drawer. And then put the marriage certificate in it as I turned the key firmly to lock it. Sooner or later, I will take the documents to the Crown Prince couple and say my greeting as the Marchioness. I really wonder what their affronted expression would look like.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The first thing I picked up was my honorable notebook and calendar, both are my number one treasure, which meticulously recorded the events in the novel, and I plan to fill in the details of what will happen after the ending that happened before my return . I will definitely use it if I have it. Other things to bring are not very important such as clothes and accessories.When I returned to the Marquis's mansion, it was already evening. As per the recommendation of the butler, I went down to the dining room for the first time and dined.Naturally, I exchanged greetings with the chef and other servants. It was only then that I realized this was the butler's way of consideration. Even though I had become a Marquis like a bean roasted by lightning , Uros, the butler, seemed to recognize me as the Marquis's spouse.**\u00a0\ubc88\uac2f\ubd88\uc5d0\u00a0\ucf69\u00a0\uad6c\uc6cc\u00a0\uba39\ub4ef/bean roasted by lightning= to behave in an impatient and hasty mannerBecause of this, I have no choice but to do my best to save Caelus, but my shoulders feel heavy all over again.**\uc5b4\uae68\uac00\u00a0\ubb34\uac70\uc6cc\uc9c4\ub2e4/shoulders feel heavy= to feel the sense of burden and responsibility as one undertakes a difficult and important task\"How is your meal? Please tell me if there is anything you particularly enjoy.\"\"It is as perfect as it can be. I have nothing more to ask for.\"I exchanged conversations with the butler in a dignified manner. Even the chef seems relieved with a faint smile. Once again, I emphasized with my whole body that I didn't come to take this home.I asked cautiously.\"By the way, how was Marquis Caelus today?\"The butler's eyebrows sank.\"He hasn't been out of his room all day. He didn't eat and drink as well.\"\"Hmmm. I see. He can't. He'd want some fruit punches mixed with brandy.\"\"!\"The butler did not hide his astonishment.\"No, how... ... !\"I smiled slightly. Naturally, I will know the drink that Caelus seek when he has no appetite. After all, he's my favorite.\"It's too early to be shocked like this, and there will be many more surprises in the future.\"\"Ahh.....\"In front of the astonished butler, I added another word carelessly.\"Tomorrow, I must visit the temple. I am thinking of returning the land that the Marquis had donated for the saintess.\"\"Yes.......?\"Hearing my words, the butlers and attendants widened their eyes as if in disbelief.The reason that Diana, who was a commoner, was able to solidify her position within the temple was thanks to the land presented by Caelus.The butler, who was stunned and tensed, immediately lowered his head deeply. His voice trembled unknowingly.\"All right. I changed my mind. I'll prepare the Marchioness's first outing.\"This is the beginning. Diana, I will tell you step-by-step how great the love you received from Caelus was. Judging from the reactions of the butlers and other users, it seems that Diana did not get very good scores from them.In the novel, I only concentrated more on the narrative and emotional portrayal between the female protagonist and the sub-male lead but did not scrutinize in detail the perspectives of other people watching them.However, in the progress of Diana's relationship with Helios, I could barely understand it. The nobles were initially against their love but eventually approved. The reason is simple. The daughter of the duke, who died after drinking the poisoned tea, fiercely opposed Diana and drove the public opinion, but after she died, the public opinion lost its center and became yu-yamuya .**\uc720\uc57c\ubb34\uc57c/yu-yamuya= incomplete/vague.In the end, thanks to that, the couple managed to get married safely. The Marquis' servants couldn't have been ignorant of Caelus' feelings. Although not many in number, they have always unified and served their young master until he reached adulthood.Perhaps they care for and love Caelus more than I do. Therefore, it is inevitable that even Diana is despised in their eyes.Of course, Diana must have her own reasons for choosing Helios over Caelus. However, there are many things in the world that we cannot help but cry emotionally to logically comprehend her decision, and we hate her for being the cause of Caelus's extreme behavior regardless..\"Everyone, thank you in many ways. I wish you all the best in the future.\"Responding to my greeting, the butler, Uros, and the servants who were with me all bowed their heads together.\"We are honored to have the Marchioness, too!\"Now we are in the same boat. Let's do good to each other.--------------------The next morning, I began busying myself with work. It doesn't have to be as flashy as going to a banquet, but I do need to dress appropriately. You can often see it in morning dramas, right? How to always have a glamorous appearance for a villainess.Today I wore a dark blue dress that matched my pitch-black hair and eyes. The intense red lip is also a must. It is a style that stands out at a glance in the temple, where white is the primary color.The butler, Uros, had a carriage with the Marquise's crest on it waiting in advance. I got on the carriage with the gentle support of the servants.\"Take good care of Marquis Caelus while you are here...\"\"You are absolutely right, my Ladyship.\"I nodded lightly in response to the butler's answer. The carriage glided through the streets. A stable ride that cannot be compared to the small carriage I used to ride. That's why everyone is a good car enthusiast. I seem to be singing and a little excited.Soon I arrived at the temple. The priests who had been contacted by a messenger sent their representatives a step ahead and rushed out. They must have been terribly confused to see a person acting as Marquis' wife that had never been heard of.As I stepped down, one of the priests bowed his head.\"Welcome. Marchioness....\"A voice that seemed unsure whether I was the real Marchioness or not. However, the crest of the Imperial Marquis is really painted on the carriage that I rode on.In this country, there is no fool who dares to pretend to be the highest extant aristocrat in this country, as anyone who steals the symbol of the nobility will be punished severely. There's no need for me to confirm that it's fake on my side. If they are in doubt, why not come to the Marquis directly?\"You sound like you're not very happy with my arrival.\"I answered deliberately bluntly. Then his tone became more polite.\"Is that even possible? If you were offended by my inexperience, please forgive me.\"\"Ugh.......\"It's really bittersweet, but there's one thing I've learned in my short life is to never make a good impression if you want to be properly respected from the start.Whether it's in this world or the real world, it's the same as looking down at good people.I followed the priest who came out of the information station and walked with my back upright. I lowered his eyes and peeked around. Curious priests were hiding and watching me. It's like a cockroach that disappears as soon as my gaze lays on them.The person sitting opposite me was not the High Priest but the high-ranking priest directly below him. If it's unpleasant, you can be offended, but that wasn't important right now.\"The purpose that came to me today is nothing else, to return the land that the lord of Ilion donated a while ago.\"\"!\"The high priest's expression hardened at my sudden request. Isn't it a bit uncomfortable to hear that you vomit up what you ate? Still, I did not hesitate and did everything I had to say.\"I am legally married to him, and I have the right to restore the property that my spouse has impulsively squandered.\"\"It's so sudden, Marchioness. that's absurd!\"Of course, I expected it to be rejected. Now it's my turn to argue.\"Let's put this straight. The Marquis donated the land to the temple at the time; wasn't it, strictly speaking, given to the current Crown Princess, who was praised as a saintess at the time?\"\"What you give to the saintess is ultimately dedicated to God.\"\"No. I can assure you. If you want proof that the Marquis donated the land to the saintess, I'll show you. I'm giving you the best chance to get it done quietly before appealing to your Majesty the Emperor. You don't understand my consideration.\"The land of Caelus, which was donated to Diana, and the greedy temple, immediately swallowed the land as their own. Still, he was afraid of Caelus' gaze, so he was hospitable to Diana in return for the land. But now that there is no one to pay for it, shouldn't he give up his land as well?The priest shook his head, sweating.\"I'm sorry, Marchioness. This is not a problem that I can solve on my own terms.\"\"Then bring in a higher-ranking person than you. Until then, I won't move here.\"\"Well, if that's the case...\" It doesn't matter if things get bigger. If only I could let the world know about Diana, who was praised as her saintess, to the world. The priest arrogantly rolled his eyes down and crossed his legs. He hurriedly went out of the office, feeling that I was challenging.After a while, a middle-aged woman dressed as a priestess came in. Her familiar face... This person who used to be Diana's superior. Of course, she doesn't know me.\"The Marchioness.\"I responded with a mischievous smirk to her politely and courteously.\"My name is Hestia. High Commissioner.\"\"I heard the word roughly, but the Marquis Caelus told me to return the donated land...\"\"Oh. You heard me right.\"I relaxed my upper body. Even if my opponent is a high priest who is the highest level leader of the temple, I should never show a shriveled look. Didn't I tell you before that the other person always takes it easy on people who seem easygoing?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayI raised the tip of my lips at an angle. With a relaxed tone and expression on my face, I opened my mouth once again.\"As you are the one closest to the saintess, you must have know it well, but Marquis Caelus clearly had special feelings for Diana. Donating the land also worked because there was no such reason. But now that the saintess has become the Crown Princess, and the land has become useless, it must be returned.\"\"Even so, the Marquis would have expected that Diana would not completely own the land. So, even if it was owned by the temple owned, its not entirely unexpected.\"The high priestess' smiling poker face has not yet broken down. If so, I'll have to make the smile disappear from that face.\"Then I can't do it. Even after talking like this, you never back down. I told the priest earlier, but if it is not resolved here, I plan to appeal in front of His Majesty the Emperor. An evil woman who used Marquis Caelus's innocence for her own sake, and the temple using it...\"\"The Marquis...!\"Oh yeah, finally, that smirk has disappeared.\"Oh my, was I being too frank? This will give you a lot to worry about. Whether the land is protected or not, the temple's authority will fall to the ground.\"Of course, this one happening will not tarnish the image of the temple. But what if my tenacious attack is added afterward?\"Until we get the land back, my demands will not stop. Of course, the imperial palace will be thrilled. So I told you. I want to end it quietly.\"I pushed my face provocatively in front of the distorted High Priestess. Then, I whispered like a villainess.\"Even if I bit the Crown Princess and won't let go, it wouldn't end with just disgrace, would it?\"\"What, what did you just say?\"I gave her a smirk as she momentarily stuttered.\"There must be people who will be quite happy if I said that to expose the two faces of the Crown Princess who stole a lot of land using her innocent face, who serves as the face of the temple, right?\"\"This...!\"\"It's not easy for a deceased Princess Letona to leave a wonderful legacy. You have eyes and ears, so you know that some nobles still consider the low-born Crown Princess, and a temple serves the princess in the shadows...\"The High Priestess opened her mouth wide and lost her words. She must have never thought that I would come out as an openly intimidating like this. But I'm not a noble in this world. I am villainess ready to play as much as I want.\"I will show you the astonishing spell that cut off the temple donations . If my words sound like a bluff, put it somewhere. You'll see how it really is.\"\"...that's a really disgraceful greeting from a proud aristocrat. Marchioness\"She can barely open her mouth open.\"Huhu, what do you do with such a pretentious pride? So, give me the land quietly.\"Her eyes fluttered slightly.\"If only the land is returned...... Would you...?\"\"Oh, yes! That was my purpose from the start.\"The High Priestess staggered and got up. She opened the door and walked out, and shortly thereafter she returned with a thin briefcase.\"This is a donation certificate that the Marquis wrote himself. Please take it with you.\"I took the document out of the envelope. I looked at the paper and nodded.\"Alright. Then, write the memorandom of the returning of the land immediately.\"It is best to leave the law, which must be thorough in everything, and the transfer of property as a visible document.--------------------The visit to the temple was not as long as expected. I successfully accomplished my purpose and returned as a Marchioness.\"How was your outing? Madam Hestia?\"I came out politely and waved the envelope in my hand to the butler who greeted me.\"Yes. It was a lot of fun. Fortunately, we can communicate well.\" Uros's eyes widened as he received the envelope.\"No, really... did you bring back the land?!\"\"Of course. It was originally from Marquis Caelus.\"Uros smiled fully.\"I have to hand over the household affairs to Madam Hestia as soon as possible. Ho Ho.\"\"Oh, not at all. I don't have any talent for managing house affairs...\"I quickly waved my hand. The purpose of my marriage to Caelus on paper is to screw Diana and Helios.Therefore, the living of the Marquis is not my responsibility.I quickly changed the topic.\"How is Marquis Caelus?\"\"Ah, He's so much better than yesterday. He ate some fruit punch and some salad.\"\"Whew. I'm glad to hear that.\"If he has an appetite, it means he has escaped the worst. A sigh of relief came out.Uros gently suggested.\"Why don't you tell Master Caelus about your visit to the temple?\"\"Me? no. I am still unfamiliar with him, so he will feel uncomfortable.\"\"However... ..\"Thank you for your kind heart. But doesn't Caelus love Diana? I don't want to draw his attention to me for nothing\"Whoa, by the way, wrestling with the high priest consumes a lot of mental energy. I just want to rest. Uros.\"\"Ah, I understood. Then I will send a maid away soon. Have a rest, Madam Hestia.\"He immediately left right in front of me.I succeeded in recovering Caelus' land documents from the temple, but in reality, this is only a small start. We must devise every detail of the butterfly effect that this event will bring.First of all, the high priestess of the temple will definitely contact Diana. She'll report it as a woman claiming to be the Marchioness of unknown origin, who had come forward and stole the land that was dedicated to her. The temple spared no support on either side so that Diana could become the princess, so if she experiences something 'unjust' like this, it is obvious that she will ask the Crown Prince for help.My existence will soon be known to the Crown Prince and his wife, but instead of looking for me right away, I will try to meet Caelus first.I'm not afraid. Rather, I'm actually looking forward to it. It is surprisingly enjoyable to step out of the position of an extra and actively intervene in this world. How the past I knew will change.I'm curious.But the most exciting thing among them is seeing the figure of Caelus, who will return to the way he used to be. It is okay not to laugh at me. It is enough for him to live life without thinking of death.I went out to look around the returned land with the manager of the Marquis' property. Fortunately, it has been well maintained. There's no way a money-loving temple would have left this Altoran-like land alone. The vibrancy of the fertile and cultivable land made me feel good at the same time.When the sun was setting in the west, I returned home, and the butler greeted me with a serious expression.\"Someone from the imperial palace had come.\"\"Oh, is it? Was he looking for the Marquis?\"\"He only delivered a letter and went back, but it seems the Crown Prince sent it. I delivered it to Master Caelus, but I don't know if he can read it.\"Caelus's condition has not yet recovered enough to allow him to carry out his official duties. Besides, the fact that he attempted to harm himself is still unknown outside of the Marquis. Please, Helios shouldn't have dug up Caelus' wounds with hasty words.\"Alright. If the Marquis hasn't read it yet, please bring it back quietly. I'll check it out. It's probably because of the land I got from the temple.\"\"Yes. Madam Hestia.\"Uros faithfully followed my instructions and was also quick. Judging from the interval between visiting the temple and receiving the call today, it seems that the high priestess robbed me of the land document that day and went straight to Diana.I had changed into my indoor outfit and was resting for a while when the butler came to the room. However, his expression was unusual.\"?\"The butler said in a cautious tone.\"Madam Hestia. The master is calling.\"\"!\"For a moment, my heart pounded loudly. Caelus said he was going to meet me for the first time! I expect his reaction to being embarrassed by what I've done. My tension tightened my breathing.\"Alright. I'll be there now.\"I reflexively looked in the mirror. I finally got to face my favorite, but I can't go out in overly comfortable clothes! However, because of the butler who was standing in front of the door without notice, he had no choice but to follow him to Caelus's room.\"Master. I'm here with Madam Hestia.\"\"Come in\"A dry voice. He didn't feel angry or anything like that. I grabbed my trembling chest and entered the room.My Caelus was not in a messy look like before, and he was wearing a robe with the front properly sewn on. The long silver hair and expressionless face are somehow cool.\"Did you call me, Marquis?\"His hands were automatically brought forward, and his tone of voice became polite. Truly my favorite pose. The butler quietly stepped back and tried to back off. But Caelus called.\"You there too.\"\"Oh, I will.\"Even Uros stood up, and Caelus' purple eyes finally looked straight at me.\"You did a very interesting job.\"I still don't know if he is angry. I shook my head lightly and affirmed.\"I'm sorry for acting your way, Marquis.\"\"Did you say your are Hestia?\"\"Yes. I am the adopted daughter of Lord Elea.\"It sounds absurd, but it wasn't until a few days after I got married that I properly introduced myself like this.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFMDF \u2013 Chapter 7It must be hectic for Diana to prepare for a large tea party that can\u2019t be avoided; in contrast, I was rather relaxed, ready to enjoy it.There were many thick papers piled up on my desk now. In order to help the butler who is always struggling, I have received some internal documents that he handled. All that was needed to be mechanically stamped.\u201cWith all due respect, I don\u2019t mind if you take charge of the estate.\u201dThe butler Uross said in an almost imploring tone. But my attitude was firm.\u201cI\u2019m just a spouse on paper. I don\u2019t want to cross the line.\u201d\u201cWell, but with Lord Kaelus not taking care of his work properly, the people of the estate are bound to stop working, madame.\u201dIt was a very earnest voice, I stared up at the butler with my seal in my hand.What does the marquis think of me? What do you believe in to ask me to take charge of this important estate?Yes, of course, I am a marquis wife who has the authority to touch the family business on paper legally. But let\u2019s face it. Am I really Kaelus\u2019 companion? Am I seriously the\u00a0 Marquis\u2019 owner? One day, I just rolled into this house. Frankly speaking, I dare not speak to the marquis\u2019 housekeepers like the butlers and ladies-in-waiting.Still, Uross\u2019 expression looking at me was so desperate that I decided to listen to him first.\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation?\u201d\u201cWe need more budget for last year\u2019s flood recovery right now. It\u2019s already been a long time since the chief\u2019s request arrived.\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t you be able to talk to the marquis for such urgent matters? He\u2019s much better now.\u201d\u201cLady Hestia\u2026.\u201dI say this, but I know the truth. Kaelus came in and out of his study little by little, and began to take a walk, but he was still unstable. There were many times when he stood blankly for no reason, and his emotions fluctuated. It will still take more time for him to return to his old sober self.\u201cPhew\u2026 Okay. Then please send me the urgent ones first. I\u2019m only going to do the ones I can do.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s enough, Lady Hestia.\u201dUross\u2019 expression became so bright that I couldn\u2019t bear to ruin it.After the butler disappeared, I said to myself, stamping my seal mechanically.\u201cIt\u2019s a disaster you brought on yourself\u2026. You could\u2019ve just stayed still, why would you come forward.. Whew\u2026.\u201dAfter a while, the butler brought a document that was almost the thickness of a university book and put it down in the corner of my desk.\u201c\u2026I asked you to bring the least to me, Uross.\u201d\u201cI did as I was told, Lady Hestia,\u201dI hated that smile on his face.In the end, I decided to postpone the simple labor of stamping only for the butler for a while, and first look at the documents that needed the decision of the marquis.Even though I had been fooling around for more than two years in a novel, I did not forget the rhythm I had in my real life. I filled in the necessary numbers by drawing a blank on the paper. The butler glanced at my work and opened his eyes wide.\u201cOh\u2026 That\u2019s a very unique way of doing it.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dWell, there\u2019s no way of using Excel in a rofan novel.The butler, who was looking over my shoulder, carefully added another question.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, could you tell me how to do it?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with that. Let me know when you\u2019re free. It\u2019s not that difficult.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you!\u201dLooking at the internal documents, I naturally learned the current status of Kaelus\u2019 territory and Ilion. Last year\u2019s flood did not cause much damage to private houses compared to other regions, but the embankment was weakened and needed to be repaired with a large amount of money.The estimate sent by the mayor of Ilion was a formidable amount.\u201cIs the Chief reliable?\u201d\u201cHe tends to be sincere and honest. I don\u2019t know if he works efficiently, but there\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to falsely report it. When I sent someone to check, there was little difference between the status and the documentation.\u201d\u201cWell, then I have to assume that this estimate is not exaggerated.\u201dSo the bottom line is that we need to take the embankment maintenance funds out of another budget. It seems that this should not be decided immediately, but rather by looking at other documents.And a more fundamental issue than that. I need to get permission from Kaelus.\u201cButler, I\u2019ll be right back, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cOh, if you need anything, I\u2019ll\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m just going to get some fresh air while I\u2019m out.\u201d\u201cI see, Lady Hestia.\u201dLegally, of course I have the authority to touch the estate, but I honestly think that I am not actually welcomed by Kaelus. Therefore, no matter what the employees think of me, such as a butler or a maid, the doctor; I must get permission from Kaelus, the lord himself first. That way, I can be confident in myself and confidently push ahead in front of people who might die under my authority.When the butler finds out what I mean, he might grab me by saying, \u201cNo, you\u2019re really the marchioness.\u201d I have no choice but to go to Kaelus as soon as possible, quietly.Kaelus was sitting on the terrace of his room. The servant who was next to me noticed that I had come and quietly withdrew.\u201cKaelus, this is Hestia.\u201dHe slowly turned his head to my voice.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dStill a low voice, but I know it\u2019s not because it\u2019s malicious. I think that\u2019s the original Kaelus.By the way, every time I see that \u201cadult beauty,\u201d my heart beats. Kaelus-nim, did you come down from heaven or were you kicked out, or did you fall? I was the one caught by him but he was still pretending to be a statue in a museum. .**TN: I think it\u2019s referring to her being mesmerized by him but he\u2019s cold as a statue.I quickly gathered my mind before the thoughts dominated me. I can\u2019t interrupt his rest for a long time, so I have to hurry up and tell him what to do.\u201cIf the marquis will allow me, I will go over the affairs of Ilion with the butler. There seems to be some urgent issues to deal with.\u201dThen Kaelus laughed, clicking his tongue.\u201cWell, I guess I\u2019ve been slacking off too long.\u201d\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t mean it like that at all! I actually want the marquis to rest more. However, there was a report from the chief that the time for repairing the embankment should not be delayed any longer\u2026\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dI added in a bit of a hurry.\u201cI\u2019m not asking you to let me handle everything on my own, but I\u2019ll work with the butler on the urgent things that must be done right now. Of course, I will report to the marquis afterwards.\u201dKaelus leaned his head back languidly, a voice that flows like a sigh, with a sort of empty smile.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s truly fortunate that someone can take my place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cBut I can\u2019t do it as perfectly as the marquis. It\u2019s impossible to fill the marquis\u2019 shoes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I used to think. I couldn\u2019t feel relief to leave it to anyone, so I thought things would work out only if I did it myself.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus glanced at me.\u201cBut now I don\u2019t know why I did my best.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dMy heart throbbed. I felt the pain of a person who tried to abandon their life for a moment.The words came out of my lips with difficulty,\u201cI wish I could ease the marquis\u2019 burden a little\u2026.\u201dMy humble heart. If I could give him everything I could for him to survive, I would be happy to do so.I don\u2019t need a give and take. I don\u2019t have to receive anything from Kaelus. There\u2019s nothing I\u2019d like to gain or want in this world anyway.Besides, this isn\u2019t my real life. One day, I fell asleep and came into the novel, and when I go back, I will suddenly leave as if I were sleeping.\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus\u2019 eyes were slightly lowered. What are you thinking?After a moment of silence, Kaelus opened his mouth again.\u201cTake care of my affairs. A follow-up report is enough, so there\u2019s no need to come and check for my opinions.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI was about to bow out, but he called me to stop.\u201cAnd\u2026.\u201d\u201c?\u201dHe looked away from me and said, looking out at the terrace.\u201c\u2026just call me by name next time. Isn\u2019t it annoying to call me marquis each time?\u201d\u201c!\u201dFor a moment, I was dumbfounded by what I heard. My mind went wild. I managed to answer in a creeping voice.\u201cYes\u2026\u201dMy face flushed with heat. I left the place almost as if I were running away.The servant, who was waiting outside, looked at me with a curious look, but I passed by without time to say hello.\u201cWhoo\u2026 Whoo\u2026.\u201dI ran straight down the hall and barely breathed until I got to my room. I couldn\u2019t breathe and ran all the way here.\u201c\u2026? Lady Hestia?\u201dThe butler, who was processing the documents in the room, stuck out his head. I raised my hand to say it\u2019s okay.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\u2026\u2026 I was walking a little faster\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou could have come slowly\u2026.\u201dI drank a sip of lukewarm tea, nodding my head roughly at from the butler who seemed confused.Still, my chest beat wildly. What do you mean by name? Call me by my first name? A title is enough!\u201cIt\u2019s crazy, really\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe butler\u2019s startled response surprised me.\u201cAh\u2026! I was just talking to myself. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dThere\u2019s a mountain of work in front of me, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be hard at all.I feel like I\u2019m getting closer to my favorite. The exaltation that he would remember me in everyday life.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI\u2019m in a lot of trouble trying to stop the laughter from leaking.A few days later, when I returned home with a slight reflection on my face from Madame Harmonia\u2019s salon, the butler held out a letter.\u201cWho sent it?\u201dI couldn\u2019t tell anything just by looking at the outside. But the butler did not immediately respond.\u201cYou\u2019ll know when you open it.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u2026\u201dI feel guilty because the butler doesn\u2019t say it right away. But I brought it into the room for now.I quickly opened the seal and read the contents. But unexpectedly.\u201cHyperion?\u201dIt\u2019s the same name when I open my eyes wide and look into it again.No, why would Helios secretly contact me like this! And why did the butler deliver this to you like that? The fact that you said, \u201cYou\u2019ll know when you open it,\u201d means that you knew who sent the letter.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI have something to say about your vision, so I want to meet you quietly.I lifted my head up in a cool manner. What is the real purpose of Helios seeing me?Specifically, if he pointed out \u201cprediction,\u201d it means that he is interested in that part. If Helios is interested in the information about the future I know.\u201cDo you want me to hold your hand\u2026.\u201dThe prediction of a border provocation from Diana must have been very impressive for Helios. If he was good at scheming, he would have felt quite attracted to my \u2018ability\u2019. Only on the premise that I\u2019m a total ally.To guess why he contacted me directly without Kaelus\u2019 knowledge, He might have considered that the bond between me and Kaelus is relatively loose. And he also kept in mind that Kaelus\u2019 condition is not yet good enough to bring up to the public.\u201cWhat should I do\u2026.\u201dPatting the letter, I got lost in thought.Honestly, I don\u2019t want to be close to Helios. How dare he hurt my favorite? After pretending to be sorry in front of Kaelus for a short time, I think he just focused on making love with Diana.I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not shameless though. If I were a person who only put my greed first, I would have contacted Kaelus proudly revealing my name regardless of whether he was well or not. He must have been sorry to tell Kaelus, \u201cLet me borrow your wife.\u201dHowever, I have no intention of meeting Helios secretly from my end. The reason why I dragged out my life in a novel that has passed the ending is only for Kaelus. What glory can I gain here as a helper of Helios?\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe tone of the letter was extremely businesslike. There was no area to complain that I didn\u2019t like the way he spoke. I still have a long way to go to my goal and must ignore how I feel.I\u2019ll have to let Kaelus know first.\u201cWell, Kaelus\u2026\u2026 It\u2019s Hestia.\u201dOh, I failed. I just can\u2019t call you by your name.\u201cCome on in.\u201dStill, I took courage in the steady response and took steps.Kaelus was out of his usual gown and was dressed in a neat indoor suit. What he has in his hands is an official gazette issued by the Imperial Palace. I guess he\u2019s finally interested in how the outside world goes. That\u2019s a relief for sure.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dWithout questioning my half-hearted address, he immediately asked. This side of him is much better for me.\u201cHis highness sent a letter quietly to me. I think I have to say something about my foresight.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m a little worried that it didn\u2019t go through Lord Kaelus, so what should I do\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe tilted his head to his side and asked in return.\u201cWhy? It\u2019s only natural that he has business with you.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s somewhat shady that he contacted me as a \u2018Hyperion\u2019 without telling you.\u201dThen he chuckled.\u201cWhy, do you feel like you\u2019re having a secret meeting with him?\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201dI raised my voice almost reflexively. Wow. This is a joke, too!But it\u2019s proof that you\u2019re more relaxed than before. It\u2019s good to take it positively.After a long sigh, I continued calmly.\u201cI don\u2019t want to do anything else behind your back. I\u2019m not saying I have to ask for permission each time but I think you should at least know.\u201dKaelus looked at me and sat down slightly.\u201cI\u2019m surprised you care so much about my position.\u201dA smile formed spontaneously.\u201cBut you\u2019re my spouse.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dKaelus had an unexpected smile, too. However, he turned his head and opened his mouth indifferently.\u201cMeet Helly first. He\u2019s more persistent than he looks. Even if you refuse this time, he will contact you again anytime.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dIf you don\u2019t want to be bothered, just do it quickly. What Kaelus said was roughly what he meant.Anyway, since we\u2019re done talking, I was going to go outside. By the way,\u201cYou\u2019re still acting like I\u2019m your employer. As you said earlier, am I not your spouse?\u201d\u201c?!\u201dIn a moment, I stopped in surprise. Out of the blue, what kind of quarrel is this?\u201cAnd when I said you could call me by my first name, you put up honorifics\u2026 At this rate, no one in this house will recognize you as a marchioness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAn embarrassing smile came to my mind.The name is, huhu, I can\u2019t help it. What should I do? However, if you want it this much, I have no choice but to practice with determination to devote my whole body to prepare my soul.And if he\u2019s worried about my treatment in this mansion now, I\u2019d like to let him know that it\u2019s not as serious as his concern.\u201cI\u2019ll try to call you by your name. And the servants don\u2019t treat me so badly that you have to worry about it. It\u2019s the opposite. They\u2019re all kind.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe expressionless Kaelus somehow seemed to show a sign of displeasure. I can\u2019t do this. I think I\u2019ll get in trouble if I don\u2019t show you how hard I\u2019ll really try.Take a deep breath.\u201cThank you for your concern anyway. Kael, Lou, S\u2026\u2026.\u201dI kept trying to put the \u201cnim\u201d on it, but I managed to call his name with a blur of words!Soon after, I turned around and ran out before he could say anything about the flood of embarrassment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 8.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith Kaelus\u2019 advice, I replied to Helios that I would comply with his request. Then, he contacted me that he would visit the marquis soon.Considering his position as \u201cHyperion,\u201d I decided to greet him directly in my room, not in an open drawing room. It\u2019s a bit drab, but isn\u2019t it only the crown prince? I\u2019ll do my best to treat him.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI sighed unconsciously as I looked at the tea utensils neatly placed on the table. I didn\u2019t know that the tea drinking scenes that usually appears in the rofan novel went through such a troublesome process.After a while, the door opened with a polite knock. Helios in a black robe appeared.\u201cWelcome, Lord Hyperion.\u201d\u201cHow have you been, marchioness?\u201d\u201cWell, thanks to you.\u201dAccording to the setting of the novel, Helios had a personality that did not care even if he was not treated politely. I greeted him in my room, so I boldly skipped the etiquette, but it ended up being true.He looked around the room, taking off his robe leisurely. I couldn\u2019t stand still, so I reached out and took over the robe. While I hung a robe on a hanger by the door, Helios walked slowly around the room.\u201cIt\u2019s my first time in your room.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI let him do as he did without saying a word. He must be looking at my room and examining my face. There was nothing to be particularly reluctant about.Come to think of it, Kaelus hasn\u2019t seen my room yet. Damn it. He came in before my favorite. I felt a slight pain in the back of my head.Suddenly, Helios stopped.\u201cHmm? Is this an internal document?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIt seems that he found the paper tower piled up next to my desk. I nodded indifferently.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve been dealing with some of the internal affairs myself for some time now. Kaelus gave me permission to.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHis hand lifted a piece of paper. These were numbers that I drew like Excel.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI waited without much explanation. I thought he\u2019d ask me something if he\u2019s curious.Helios looked into the \u2018Excel\u2019 form for a long time and sighed quietly.\u201cHave you ever done this before?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIn this life, of course.\u201cVery intuitive. Even I, an outsider, can see it at a glance.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dI couldn\u2019t read any other emotion from Helios\u2019 expression as he put the paper back in place.When he finally sat down on the sofa, I finally noticed the difficulty facing me. Making the damn tea.I made a promise to learn as much as I could from the butler or the lady-in-waiting, but I didn\u2019t have time to sit down and learn because both of them were busy.\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios was waiting for the tea to be served as if it was a matter of course. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t care how it happens in the end.Pick up the tea leaves roughly by eye measurement, place them on a filter, and pour the prepared hot water. When the color seemed to have changed moderately, I quickly picked up the teapot and poured it into an empty teacup.I added, as an excuse, as I served Helios.\u201cI\u2019m not good yet, but\u2026.\u201dI felt like crying.Helios held the tea with a blank face. I looked on with a throbbing heart.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dOh, I\u2019m screwed. I bowed my head quickly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dWith a long, meaningless sigh, Helios looked up at me.\u201cWell, there\u2019s not much of a difference compared to Diana.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s an obvious critique. It must be a critique. At the beginning of the novel, it was revealed how bad Diana made the tea. My skills may have improved a lot now.Instead of talking about the taste of my tea, Helios brought up a different topic.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I did a little research on your background.\u201dThen you must have found out that I was adopted as an adopted daughter for the money of Lord Elea.I received the word with a bitter smile.\u201cThen you must have found out that I was originally a commoner.\u201dHelios nodded slowly and affirmed.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to hide it, but I apologize if you felt uncomfortable because I didn\u2019t tell you beforehand.\u201dFirst, I lowered my head. Then I heard an unexpectedly plain voice.\u201cNo, not really. I just wanted to say that I wasn\u2019t surprised by the taste of your tea.\u201d\u201c\u2026Uhh, here we go.\u201dI don\u2019t know what to do with your generosity.That\u2019s enough small talk anyway. It\u2019s time to get down to business.\u201cBy the way\u2026 what were you going to say about my abilities?\u201dHelios raised his chin slightly.\u201cThe prophecy I heard through the crown princess was honestly very helpful. I\u2019ll put it bluntly. Why don\u2019t you use that power for this country?\u201dIt was also unexpected. The corners of my mouth bent deviously.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. I\u2019m a narrow-minded person, so I\u2019m not good enough to do something so big.\u201d\u201cHmph. Is it a rejection while pretending to be concerned?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not something to be concerned about. My sight doesn\u2019t reach all state affairs, it just happened to show an important event.\u201d\u201cFor that matter, your expression is too natural.\u201dHelios\u2019 golden eyes narrowed. Was my inner feelings too obvious?Without hesitation, I immediately made an excuse.\u201cMy husband\u2019s health hasn\u2019t recovered yet. I\u2019d like to focus on internal affairs for the time being.\u201dI think that\u2019s a pretty cool excuse. But Helios snorted.\u201cOh, no. Do you mean housework comes before the prince\u2019s words? The attitude of an imperial aristocrat is truly remarkable.\u201dHe replied with a grin.\u201cTo put it bluntly, I\u2019m putting my husband first. An old friend of yours who was left alone while you were excited with happiness.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe eyes that stayed the same is quite sharp. But he can\u2019t deny it. While he and Diana were having fun, Kaelus tried to put a knife in his chest.I continued without a smile.\u201cMy ability will be used where I want to use it. Who cares if it\u2019s not for the safety of the empire?\u201dHelios, therefore. If you want to work with me, you should come back with a more sincere attitude than you are now.The opponent\u2019s eyes sank coldly.\u201cThen why did you give us information about the border area last time?\u201d\u201cOh, didn\u2019t the crown princess tell you? I asked for a deal to let me know when the second tea party will be held.\u201dAh, Diana. Even though I was courteous in front of you, you should have realized my intentions. If there\u2019s something that comes, there should be something going. Sadly, Diana didn\u2019t seem to have mentioned it to Helios.I\u2019m a commoner, and Diana is a commoner. If Helios had fantasized that all of the commoners would be like Diana, he would have to rethink this opportunity.I\u2019m not a good and just person like Diana. The reason why I changed my mind to intervene so surely after staying on the sidelines in this world is to avenge Kaelus.Helios looked at me with piercing eyes.\u201cYou are very selfish.\u201dI\u2019m not going to deny it. However, this blatant comment is a bit offensive.\u201cIf I were really selfish, I would make false predictions and profit from them, your highness.\u201dI continued with an arrogant look.\u201cIf you want my help, you\u2019ll have to give something that will move me. Well, if you don\u2019t want to do that, I\u2019ll just refuse your request, so it\u2019s fair.\u201dHelios twisted his lips in a ridiculous way.\u201cYou must not be afraid of me, the crown prince.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the world I\u2019m afraid of. I can see the future. Isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201dI smiled with a relaxed manner.There was sarcasm in the tone of Helios.\u201cThen if we want to move you, we have no choice but to move Kaelus, your number one priority?\u201d\u201cIf you really want to use my ability, it won\u2019t help much if you force me like that, your highness.\u201dI immediately responded.Helios frowned.\u201cOkay, what do you want?\u201dIt seems that he doesn\u2019t like it when I do what I want. But neither do I. I don\u2019t want to give Helios the initiative.\u201cGive me the estate of the dead Duke of Orcus. And I want you to raise my husband\u2019s title.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHelios\u2019 golden eye grew to its fullest.In fact, this was kind of a self-declaration. By absorbing the legacy of Letona, a villain who drank poison tea and left the novel, it symbolized that I was completely at the opposite end of Diana.\u201cIf you will grant me my request, I will meet you from time to time and show you the future you need to govern this empire.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as it sounds. Most of all, there\u2019s no justification.\u201dHe shook his head in distress. But my stubbornness was also formidable.\u201cYou can make up any excuse. That\u2019s your power.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dHelios swept his hair up with a look of bewilderment.\u201cI can\u2019t fulfill your request on my own. It\u2019s up to his majesty to decide. It\u2019s not something I can do at will just because I want to.\u201dThen should I give you some breathing room?\u201cAll right, so if you promise me in writing, I\u2019ll give you some help with that. However, you must listen after a reasonable cause has been established.*\u201d*TN: He needs to listen to her demands once the deal is made\u201cIt\u2019s not bad. Alright.\u201dHelios replied with a long sigh.I didn\u2019t hesitate to bring paper and wax to the barely settled deal. The two memorandums were made identical to each other to promise to grant the land of the former Duke and the title of\u00a0 duke, with each signed by Helios. The crown prince\u2019s seal was also stamped with wax to further enhance his proof.And another thing.\u201cAs a reason for your access to your office, please provide me with a title.\u201d\u201cTitle?\u201d\u201cYes, I have to explain to the public why I visit the palace frequently and I want to\u00a0 try to hide my abilities as much as I can.\u201dAfter an expressionless reply, he burst into a false smile and then nodded.\u201cThat makes sense. I\u2019ll appoint you as my assistant. I\u2019ll send you a formal letter of appointment back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m honored, your highness.\u201dI gave him a hearty laugh. I also did not forget his last request.\u201cIt\u2019s entirely up to you whether you believe if the information I tell you is true or not. And remember that information is useful only if you admit it to be true.\u201dHelios returned to the face of the original cool-headed monarch and answered.\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll remember that.\u201dHe left my room as soon as he accomplished his purpose.I was finally left alone.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dSince I was nervous in my own way, a long sigh naturally erupted.Still, there have been considerable achievements. I pulled out this much with a two-year time limit skill.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dIn the meantime, I will make Kaelus shine the most in this empire. I didn\u2019t dare to stand next to the main characters of the past.Finally, Diana decided to have a second tea party.Even if it was slow, it happened too late. Don\u2019t you know what the aristocracy is like? After meeting Diana the other day, I even probed Madame Harmonia and pressured her to host a tea party. And yet, I can\u2019t believe I finally got a definite answer.Countess Eriness, who implicitly became an ally of mine, spread an air of dissatisfaction with the crown princess little by little, centering on her close connections, while Diana was procrastinating. Young aristocrats were invited shortly after she was crowned crown princess, but other nobles who were older than her, and should be respected, were relatively neglected.The self-respecting ladies never took it lightly when pushed out by the young ones. Moreover, she is a commoner-born crown princess. She\u2019s already looking down on them, and she\u2019s acting out of her mind. Already, Diana was full of faults to be caught by them.\u201cBy the way, if I don\u2019t want to find fault in useless things\u2026.\u201dI murmured as I rummaged around in the dressing room for a few clothes.To be honest with the butler, it wasn\u2019t hard to fit in the new dress but somehow I didn\u2019t want to.Now, the skilled tailors in the capital are probably suffering from a rush of orders. And the clothes they make will all appear at Diana\u2019s tea party. An obvious social trend.If you don\u2019t want to stand out, it\u2019s best to follow the trend. I also know that I don\u2019t blame anyone for acting like every lady in this flow.But in reality, what is it? The world already knows that I\u2019m a commoner\u00a0 as much as Diana. What if I really appear like a noble?I entered aristocratic society like a surprising star. There must be someone jealous of my situation. And they\u2019ll be talking behind my back. \u2018Oh, there\u2019s another fake pretending to be an aristocrat.\u2019Therefore, I am an aristocrat, but I am not.Eventually, I decided to discuss the matter with Clarice, the lady-in-waiting.\u201cI\u2019d like to have my dress mended, Clarice.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dClarice asked back with a look of complete surprise.\u201cWe still have time to spare before the crown princess\u2019 tea party, ma\u2019am. Wouldn\u2019t you rather make a new dress? The marquis won\u2019t object too much.\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s a reason why I can\u2019t.\u201dI briefed her on my thoughts. About my position, which should be dignified like an aristocrat, but different from the aristocrats from birth.Clarice understood my meaning and nodded quietly.\u201cHmm\u2026 I see\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo I have to do something with the clothes I already have. It would be perfect to have a good person in the marquis, but if not, ask me what I\u2019d like. As long as you have skills, you don\u2019t have to be a famous tailor.\u201dI mean, I\u2019ll reform the dress I have. Fortunately, I had a lot of cheap dresses and accessories that I bought to chase Kaelus, who attended the banquet, in the past. It was more a question of how sophisticated to make it look.The lady-in-waiting seemed to be thinking carefully, and soon smiled softly.\u201cThere\u2019s a craftsman who went viral in this skill.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d\u201cYes. It\u2019s mainly famous among aristocratic patrons. He\u2019s a person who takes clothes and ornaments that the nobles throw away and makes them look good. If you don\u2019t mind\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dIt\u2019s perfect in my situation!\u201cThen please introduce yourself. It\u2019d be better if you could get them.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s the marquis\u2019 call, he\u2019ll come running, leaving all his work behind. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dAs expected, the trustworthy Clarice. There is no question of what she says.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. It\u2019s a must.\u201dShe returned a generous smile.This solved the tea party dress, and I was slowly curious about how Diana was preparing for the palace. Helios must have given me an assistant pass, should we go to the palace?Now that I have made up my mind, I have decided to tell Kaelus for now. In addition, we need to go and tell Helios about the \u2018prophecy\u2019 that I will deliver.I headed to the garden to find him taking a walk with his servant.\u201cKaelus\u2026\u201dEvery time I sing it, I feel like I\u2019m going to die because of the way\u00a0 my voice tries to crawl in itself. Thankfully, Kaelus quickly understood and turned around.\u201cAh, Hestia.\u201dAn indifferent tone. My name in the novel, not originally mine.Even though there is nothing to beat my heart, just saying it like that raises my cheekbones*. Seriously, all the darkness in the world has disappeared because of my favorite. Why? Because he\u2019s too bright.*TN: makes her smile from just saying his nameWithout hiding my expression, I spoke to Kaelus with a smiling face.\u201cIt\u2019s a nice day to drink tea outside.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dThe quick-witted servant interrupted quickly.\u201cShould I bring some refreshments?\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019d be great.\u201dKaelus nodded in a cool way.While the servant quickly headed to the mansion, he pointed to a table nearby.\u201cLet\u2019s sit here.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe\u2019s definitely thinner than before. Looking at it from the outside, it\u2019s so obvious. Evidence of how the happy ending of Helios and Diana hurt him.Tears welled up, but I tried to calmly air out my business.\u201cI\u2019m going to see him soon, his highness.\u201d\u201cHmm? What\u2019s the matter?\u201dHe didn\u2019t ask again to oppose it, but he sounded really curious. I answered right away without feeling uncomfortable.\u201cHe even appointed me as his assistant to listen to my sight, so I think I should visit him as soon as possible. And I wanted to tell you what I was going to tell him.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026\u201dKaelus looked interested.\u201cEven though you don\u2019t have to?\u201d\u201cWell.. yes, I don\u2019t want to be in a relationship where I share secrets with the crown prince.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re going to tell me, too.\u201dHe tilted his head and asked, squinting.\u201cWhat if I don\u2019t want to hear that much?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dOh, no. I didn\u2019t think of that.I bowed my head gently.\u201cThen I won\u2019t tell you. You don\u2019t have to force yourself to hear something you don\u2019t want to hear.\u201dThen Kaelus laughed out loud.\u201cBut now that there\u2019s no way to beat him. I\u2019m curious. This is the first prophecy to Helios\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dBut I was heartbroken by a new realization that I hadn\u2019t thought of. Maybe Kaelus didn\u2019t want to hear it. The story between Helios and I.Well, sometimes not knowing is the best medicine, but I thought that was too simple. Next time, I should carefully consider Kaelus\u2019 position.Just in time, a tray of refreshments was brought over. The conversation was interrupted for a moment. It was not until the servant had left that I spoke again.\u201cHis majesty is about to fall ill.\u201d\u201c!\u201dKaelus held up his cup and froze. On the other hand, I continued calmly.\u201cHe\u2019s not going to be in critical condition right now, but he\u2019s definitely going to be weaker than he was before. The crown prince\u2019s shoulders will become heavier.\u201d\u201c\u2026is that your first foreshadowing for Heli?\u201dHis voice was frighteningly cold.\u201cYes.\u201dBefore returning, I remember the tumultuousness of the whole capital. The emperor, who seemed to be doing well without any problems, suddenly collapsed. The Imperial Palace and the nobles turned upside down, and Diana stayed by the emperor\u2019s side all the time since he fell and used her healing power. In fact, it was the last time she was able to use her power.I don\u2019t know if this was the cause, but Diana\u2019s healing power never showed this level of power again. Maybe the special buff that was given to her ended with the ending of the novel.After careful selection of what to say, Kaelus managed to squeeze out his voice.\u201c\u2026and with that wisdom, can you save his majesty?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure I can completely prevent it. But it\u2019s much better than being ignorant.\u201dIt\u2019s not a lie. I don\u2019t know what kind of illness the emperor fell ill with. Even if Diana is prepared in advance, it is not certain whether the sudden attack itself can be prevented. Still, I thought that first aid would be possible much faster if I stayed close.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dKaelus sighed heavily. Apparently shocked by my words that the emperor was about to lie ill, Kaelus said nothing for a while.Being close to Helios, Kaelus naturally respected and followed the emperor. The emperor, who knew his parents\u2019 circumstances early on, considered him as another son.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI waited quietly for Kaelus to sort out his feelings. It wasn\u2019t long before a weak voice came out.\u201cWhen are you going to the palace?\u201d\u201cIf possible, I will see the Crown Prince tomorrow.\u201dI\u2019m an official aide, so I didn\u2019t have to wait until I get his invitation. With my answer, Kaelus seemed troubled, and soon looked straight at me with his purple eyes.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026! Is that okay with you?\u201dHe nodded heavily when asked back in surprise.\u201cI\u2019m not going to Helios. It\u2019s because I want to see your Majesty in good health one more time.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026.\u201dI could understand his feelings. But will his mental strength, which has not fully recovered, be alright?\u201dHe smiled bitterly as if he had read my expression.\u201cI can see what you\u2019re worried about. Are you worried about me running into Diana?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe silence was affirmation, Kaelus sighed quietly.\u201cWe can be careful not to meet her. And it\u2019s been a while, so it\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cThen shall we go together? I\u2019ll stay with you until I see him.\u201dHe looked at me, still.\u201cAre you nervous?\u201d\u201cOf course! If you fall down again\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, not that one.\u201dI heard Kaelus\u2019 voice after cutting my words.\u201cI mean, am I worried that I\u2019ll be clinging onto Diana again?\u201d\u201c!\u201dI closed my mouth.\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus\u2019 purple eyes sank darkly. What does he think I\u2019ll answer?I said what I wanted to say without wavering.\u201cIf it\u2019s more painful to force yourself to forget, don\u2019t it.\u201dMy wish is quite simple. To make Kaelus happy.\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe way he stared at me tickled for no reason. I said it again as if I were expressing my opinion so that he wouldn\u2019t misunderstand what I meant.\u201cWhen you have severe mood swings, you have difficulty breathing. That\u2019s all I\u2019m worried about.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe reason I married you is not to repeat that miserable future that I had seen before. Please love and hate as your heart desires. As much as you want, regardless of my existence.\u201dHe grinned.\u201cIt\u2019ll be settled in two years anyway.\u201dBefore that, I will surely make Diana regret it. I am confident of winning.My favorite, second lead Kaelus, where coolness and passion coexist clearly. I can do anything if the fascinating character comes back. This is my world where my story unfolds, the story of the author is over.In the story I create, the character doesn\u2019t have to love the creator outside the novel.Kaelus spoke slowly with a blank face.\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t have to be next to me at the Imperial Palace. In the meantime, you meet Helios. If I come out from seeing his majesty first, I will come over to you.\u201dI had to nod my head.\u201cAlright.\u201dThe palace is full of servants, so even if Kaelus falls down without breathing, they can take action immediately. but to trust the infrastructure of the Imperial Palace.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 8.2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was Kaelus\u2019 first outing since his suicide attempt. Of course, the butler and the other servants were full of worry.\u201cLady Hestia, please take good care of Lord Kaelus\u2026\u201dUross whispered in a low voice, so that only I could hear him. I also nodded discreetly so that Kaelus wouldn\u2019t see.\u201cDon\u2019t worry.\u201dKaelus looked a little pale, perhaps nervous about his first outing in a long time. Nevertheless, the peculiar coldness remained.\u201cLet\u2019s go, Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLeaving behind the butler\u2019s worried eyes, he quickly climbed into the carriage.For the first time, I went out with my favorite, but honestly, I was more nervous than excited. Pleasant excitement is only possible when you\u2019re at a moderate distance, and now!\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmm? Is there anything uncomfortable?\u201dIt\u2019s because of you, you!\u201cNo, I\u2019m just a little nervous.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dThe purple eyes looked at me in disbelief, but I didn\u2019t try to meet them.The carriage soon fell silent. It was because we weren\u2019t the type to say anything to break the silence. The most confusing thing at times like this is the eye contact. All I did was look outside once in a while, touching the window only with my fingers.Unlike me, Kaelus stared through the carriage window with a blank stare. The expression was so beautiful that my heart throbbed for no reason.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFeeling his gaze, I deliberately lowered my head in fear that his concentration would be broken. And in my head, I focused on what I would do when I met Helios at the palace.Today\u2019s goal was to learn about Diana\u2019s tea party preparations in addition to delivering my foreshadowing to Helios. It would be nice if I could snoop around here and there as an excuse for a long visit to the palace. It\u2019s icing on the cake.In the current imperial family without an empress, Diana holds the highest position as a female adult. How much did she control the experienced servants who had been with the royal family for decades? In fact, it\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that the success or failure of this tea party is in their hands.\u201cDo you have any concerns?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI was surprised by the unexpected voice. Kaelus\u2019 expressionless face was looking at me.\u201cAh\u2026 I was just thinking about this and that\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs it something serious?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. But I thought it was my first visit to the Imperial Palace..\u201dCome to think of it, I\u2019m accompanying Kaelus now. Then I should reconsider going around the palace. Wouldn\u2019t it be a problem if he ran into someone uncomfortable \u2013 Diana or Helios? Unfortunately, we have no choice but to take a rain check on the preparation of the tea party.\u201cYou didn\u2019t look around properly the other day.\u201dI gave a general nod to Kaelus\u2019 question.\u201cYes, I was very nervous because it was my first visit.\u201dI answered casually and waved my hands hastily.\u201cBut I\u2019m not going around the palace today. Since you\u2019re here this time, I\u2019m just going to finish my business and go home.\u201dKaelus muttered bitterly.\u201cIs it because of me?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI shouldn\u2019t have said, \u2018Because you\u2019re here, too.\u2019 I think I made Kaelus\u2019 heart heavy for no reason.Whether he knew how I felt, he continued in his usual indifferent tone.\u201cThen let\u2019s go back on our own as soon as we\u2019re done. I don\u2019t have to wait for you, and you don\u2019t have to worry about me.\u201d\u201cWhat? But\u2026\u201dI was embarrassed and immediately tried to refute it. But Kaelus raised his hand to shut me down.\u201cI know you don\u2019t trust me, but I\u2019m not a child. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not stupid enough to follow you around and take care of you.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that. What are you going to do if you fall down?!\u201dHis answer went to the back of my mind. My voice raised without my intention.Nevertheless, Kaelus answered indifferently without changing his countenance.\u201cI\u2019m not that weak. Anyway, that\u2019s what I think.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThat stubborn, single minded bonehead. It was the real appearance of my favorite Kaelus that I had forgotten. I\u2019m angry right now, but I\u2019m also happy to be honest. Gradually he seemed to be returning to his old days.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201dI guess he thought it was unexpected for me to accept it with a sigh. Kaelus\u2019 eyebrows were raised slightly. But that\u2019s all. He didn\u2019t say anything else.Yes, the crown princess, who is busy preparing for the tea party, won\u2019t rush around to the palace where the emperor lives in this situation. I can only hope she\u2019s stuck in the lily palace.As soon as the carriage entered the palace, I signaled the coachman and stopped the carriage.\u201cI\u2019ll get off here and walk to the lily palace. See you at the marquis.\u201dAs I walk, I can see the atmosphere of the servants and above all, isn\u2019t it better to give up the carriage to the patient?\u201c\u2026I won\u2019t.\u201dKaelus turned away without much objection. Although he didn\u2019t look at me, I got off with a smile.I looked for a moment at the marquis\u2019 carriage, which was slowly moving away. And soon, I walked vigorously toward the crown prince\u2019s residence.It was very rare for a noble woman to walk alone without a single maid. Perhaps because of that, the passing people of the palace did not seem to think that I was the talk of the town, Marchioness Hestia. Everyone passed by indifferently without looking back.I didn\u2019t come to Helios because I didn\u2019t set a time to meet anyway, so I walked leisurely. I think it was good that I decided to act move from Kaelus. I am grateful to him for the delay.But after a while.\u201cIt\u2019s quite spacious\u2026.\u201dBefore, I didn\u2019t know I had to walk this much because I came to the lily palace by carriage. I regret getting off at the front gate now, but what can I do?\u201cYou have to walk.\u201dI answered my own question.My feet are beginning to hurt in my shoes. I couldn\u2019t sit down anywhere, so I looked up and around. Just in time, I found a bench moderately covered by shrubs, and I sat on it with a slight limp.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI slipped off my shoes and hung them on my toes. I thought I could only live when the pressure on my feet disappeared.Then, chatter came from afar. I stopped breathing without realizing it.\u201cMadame Merope seems to have a lot of difficulties in many ways.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since she had a tea party this big.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s not easy to convince her highness.\u201d\u201cI know. It\u2019s not just a difference of taste\u2026.\u201dThe voices quickly faded away.\u201c\u2026.\u201dIt was a short conversation between the ladies, but it was enough to grasp the situation.Madame Merope. The maid who served the deceased Empress. She was one of the most experienced people in this palace. Her inability to \u2018persuade her highness\u2019 meant that Diana and her were at odds over the tea party concept.Of course, Diana had the right to decide when the two are at odds. But it would be better to accept Madame Merope\u2019s opinion. Because her years and experience are no match for that of Diana, who has just risen from commoner to crown princess.Judging from Diana\u2019s taste in the novel, Diana would definitely want a tea party with a simple and frugal atmosphere. However, they are not unmarried young ladies, but the Crown Princess is meeting with the noble ladies in charge of each family for the first time, and the concept of simpleness is not suitable. Even if you don\u2019t wear fancy gold jewelry recklessly, you need to raise your dignity. Didn\u2019t Madame Merope probably emphasize this?I wish we could bump into each other. The imperial palace\u2019s sense and the new royal family member that just rolled in. It just so happens that the confrontation is so clear!I\u2019m going to have to tell Countess Erinnis about this. She may be able to attract some useful public opinion because she is a quiet woman when her best friends sit together.I applied for an audience and waited for a while, but soon I was called into Helios\u2019 office.\u201cIt\u2019s surprising that you came to see me first.\u201dHelios said this as soon as he saw me. It\u2019s rather good that you don\u2019t have to set a cumbersome example. I immediately went to business in a dry tone.\u201cI have to tell you about the upcoming future. I apologize for the bad news, your highness the crown prince.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a bad future?\u201dHelios came up at once\u00a0 with a grimace and sat down.\u201cTell me, marchioness.\u201d\u201cIn a few days the emperor will suddenly fall ill. But I don\u2019t know the exact time or what kind of disease it is.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHe froze.After a moment of silence, questions poured out as if a bank had burst.\u201cYou don\u2019t know when? So you can stop him? Can he recover?\u201dMy voice was calm while his voice was growing louder.\u201cTo be honest with you, you can\u2019t stop it completely. However, keep your royal highness as close as possible to his majesty. Then, even if an accident occurs, you will be able to use her healing power immediately. Of course, there will be less aftereffects.\u201dHelios\u2019 face flushed in confusion.\u201cThe future you originally saw\u2026 How was it?\u201dI replied in a dull way.\u201cHe\u2019ll collapse while you\u2019re dealing with the affairs. The servant, who was nearby, ran straight to the palace and called for the holy princess, but the time was delayed, and the king\u2019s movements became uncomfortable and his energy was greatly reduced.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHelios covered his face with his hands. Even if it was a future that had not yet happened, it seemed quite shocking.\u201cTotally\u2026unstoppable\u2026 I mean\u2026.\u201d\u201cI understand that your highness the crown princess still sees him every night and exercises her power. And yet this is bound to happen.\u201d\u201cThen what the hell is she doing\u2026!\u201dI didn\u2019t feel a hint of pity at the sight of the man muttering hopelessly.So who said to monopolize the power of healing only for imperial family? Even if you get a holy healing shower every day, those who are sick will get sick and those who will die will die.\u201cBut if you know in advance and prepare yourself, he will recover quickly even if he falls. Don\u2019t worry too much. That\u2019s why I\u2019m telling you about the future.\u201d\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dHelios breathed a deep sigh. I waited in silence for him to regain his composure.In a moment,\u201c\u2026the only way to prepare is to keep Diana near the king?\u201d\u201cThat was the best I could think of, but if you have any other good ideas, you may do so.\u201d\u201cDiana is so busy these days.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of the tea party. It\u2019s a tough job.\u201dHelios looked up at me.\u201cIf you don\u2019t know when he\u2019s going to faint, it means you don\u2019t know if it\u2019s today or tomorrow, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI didn\u2019t hesitate to say yes.Helios sang his servant with a pale complexion.\u201cZenon!\u201dThe chief of the lily palace, which is the closest to the crown prince, came running like a log.\u201cDid you call me, your grace?\u201d\u201cTell the crown princess. Head for the main palace right now. I\u2019ll catch up soon.\u201d\u201c!\u201dIt was rather me who was heartbroken by his instructions. Kaelus was in the emperor\u2019s place right now!Zenon, the captain of the ship, ran back like the wind. I didn\u2019t have time to catch him.\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dLooking at the back of it in a stupor, Helios\u2019 voice rang.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there a problem?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.\u201dI grabbed my forehead without realizing it. What should I do? Should I tell you the truth?\u201cI\u2019m asking you what it is, marchioness.\u201dThe same seemed to be true of Helios, who was nervous. The hesitation will only make him even more anxious. I closed my eyes tightly and confessed.\u201cMy husband is now at the palace\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dI guess he didn\u2019t expect this kind of answer. Helios\u2019 expression was rarely very blank.I answered him again.\u201cKaelus is presenting to his majesty the emperor. To avoid encountering the crown princess, we were supposed to return separately as soon as the meeting was over..\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios shut up at once and for all.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026If Kael is talking to him, we can run into him outside after.\u201dThere was no room for further hesitation. I got out of my seat right away.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your grace. I\u2019m worried about my husband\u2019s condition, so I have to get up first.\u201d\u201cI said I\u2019d go anyway, so let\u2019s move together.\u201dWe left the lily palace and headed for the emperor\u2019s residence.It is also called the emperor\u2019s main palace-the lion palace because of the statue in front of the palace. I hurried to the door.While he was catching his breath, Helios asked the guard in front of the palace.\u201cDid Marquis Kaelus come out yet?\u201d\u201cYes, your highness,\u201dThis time I asked.\u201cHas the crown princess entered yet?\u201d\u201cYes, she went into his majesty\u2019s place after receiving urgent messages.\u201d\u201c!\u201dOh, my God, Diana. You\u2019re incredibly quick. Helios suddenly ordered to go to the emperor, but you came running without a question? The saint who used to scold the high priests!In any case, the reality remains unchanged. Kaelus eventually met Diana at the palace.Helios and I had no choice but to wait until the two of them came out to us. First of all, it was not possible to invade the place where the emperor and his subjects were talking alone, and the grounds for our invasion were weak.Diana was the exception. Thanks to her healing powers, she was able to ignore most taboos in the palace. Unless the emperor specifically ordered a ban on entry, Diana could enter and leave the bedroom where he slept.It was a privilege that transcended even the crown prince.\u201c\u2026 The crown princess seems to be really concerned about his majesty.\u201dI was a little choked up, so I couldn\u2019t stop talking. I have to control my emotions perfectly, but I failed this time.Helios sighed quietly, too.\u201cThe other servant said he was walking near the Lion Palace just in time. That\u2019s why she arrived so soon\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s funny that coincidences always overlap when they\u2019re bad. It has already happened anyway. I hope Kaelus comes out without a hitch.Then I heard Helios\u2019 bitter voice.\u201cThe marquis once told me,\u201d\u201c?\u201dYou must be talking about when you came to check on Kaelus\u2019 marriage. I waited quietly for his next words.\u201cWith me and Diana\u2026 He said he couldn\u2019t smile like he used to.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dIs it a kind of declaration of an end to\u00a0 friendship? Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that you\u2019re going to quit your relationship at all, but at least it\u2019s a sign that you\u2019re going to abandon your position as a best friend.Prior to his return, he lost Kaelus to death, and after my return, he followed his own will. Helios was destined to lose his best friend in life anyway.His face stiffened and he could hardly straighten it out.\u201cMy husband sometimes has difficulty breathing when he\u2019s in a bad emotional state. Your Highness is around, so first aid will be quick.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios couldn\u2019t say anything at my complaints.Diana\u2019s appearance was simply a sickening drug cycle for Kaelus. Kaelus himself said it\u2019s okay because he\u2019s found some stability, but that\u2019s what he says when she\u2019s not in front of him, and no one knows what\u2019s going to happen if he encounters her in person.Still, it\u2019s a relief to see that there is no particular disturbance inside. If any one of them fell down, it would have gone crazy.After awhile,\u201c!\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe door to the living room room opened. A white-faced Kaelus came out.\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe glanced at the hardened Helios, and then immediately turned his gaze to me.\u201cYou came after all. You don\u2019t have to worry.\u201dI held out my hand like I was possessed by something. in a perfectly natural motion As if asking him for an escort.And Kaelus gracefully held my hand in front of Helios.\u201cLet\u2019s go back, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dHe turned his back and glanced at Helios. Helios only stood beautifully like a pillar of ice.Kaelus really didn\u2019t say a word to Helios.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn the carriage homeward, Kaelus was white and quiet. As if to prove that he was fine, his expression was very disturbing.\u201cKaelus.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI grabbed his hand quickly. It was cold.\u201cYes, it\u2019s all right. It\u2019s all over now.\u201dHow do you feel when you suddenly face the cause that made you want to die? I don\u2019t dare to guess.Terrible love and hatred. He wanted to die because of her, but his heart beats because of her again. How on earth should we deal with this terrible contradiction?\u201cYou did a great job. Kaelus, you did a great job.\u201dMy favorite who must have been overwhelmed with shame when facing Diana. How much he must have wanted his heart to be firm as a rock. Nevertheless, walking straight out without being disturbed to the end is proof that Kaelus himself tried hard enough to not die.Kaelus\u2019 blank face slowly turned toward me.\u201cI\u2019ve done a good job\u2026?\u201dHis eyes turned into a cold sneer.\u201cWhat do you know, Hestia?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs a reader of this novel many times, I probably understand more about the world than you do. Kaelus.But I didn\u2019t plead. Because it\u2019s not my goal to be recognized and accepted by Kaelus. He may vent his resentment on me. If only it would comfort him and make him feel at peace.\u201cI guess your foresight must be able to read people\u2019s minds, right? Is that why you\u2019re pretending to know?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus\u2019 sharp purple eyes flew towards my face and stayed there. I bowed my head in silence. Rather than those sharp eyes, it is more painful to worry about the pain he is unable to talk about. I wish I could scream.I felt his cold anger that could even freeze my breath, but I was rather happy.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dRather, I lowered my body so that he could pour out his emotions to his heart\u2019s content.* This is all I can do right now.*TN: she\u2019s looking down so he can sort out his feelings without her seeing\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe carriage soon became so quiet that I could not hear a breath.\u201cHow have you been?\u201dThe butler and the\u00a0 lady-in-waiting came out to greet us.\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus went up to his room, building a cold air, without replying. They looked at me with round eyes.\u201cMadam\u2026\u201d\u201cPhew, the marquis, he\u2019s in a very bad mood. I\u2019ll tell you the details later.\u201dThe butler and the\u00a0 lady-in-waiting looked at each other for a moment and immediately nodded.\u201cThen I\u2019ll see you in your room after I go to Kaelus.\u201d\u201cYes, Uross.\u201dThe butler went up the stairs to Kaelus, and only Clarice the maid remained behind me.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dShe asked anxiously after a long sigh.\u201cDid anything bad happen?\u201d\u201cYes, the thing I wanted to avoid the most happened. Oh, by the way, how\u2019s the tea party dress going?\u201d\u201cOh, I told the tailor the design you wanted. The sketch will arrive soon.\u201d\u201cI see. It\u2019s going well.\u201dWith the help of Clarice, I took off my dress and removed my accessories, and soon the butler Uross reappeared.\u201cKaelus says he wants to cool off by himself.\u201d\u201cPhew, yes\u2026.\u201dI informed the two that Kaelus met Diana while talking to the emperor alone. And also that Diana had the power of healing and was able to go in and out of the emperor\u2019s room without restriction.The butler and the\u00a0 lady-in-waiting were very embarrassed.\u201cBut that\u2019s why there\u2019s no point in being alone, right?\u201d\u201cThere was no way to stop it because the Emperor did not forbid it.\u201dI purposely hid the story that Helios sent Diana in a hurry because of my \u2018prediction\u2019. Since I could not mention the contents of my foresight to them.The butler shook his head.\u201cMaster must have been quite surprised.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid so. And on the way back, he felt even worse because I said something a little presumptuous.\u201d\u201cMadam\u2026\u201dClarice looked embarrassed next to him, too.\u201cI\u2019m fine though. Because Kaelus showed his feelings a little bit. If he had kept it to himself, he would have had difficulty breathing as before.\u201dThe butler bent down at once.\u201cI\u2019ll have to go to Kaelus again with the doctor, Lady Hestia\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s do that.\u201dAfter sending out the maid, I laid my nervous body on the bed.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI should have stopped him more aggressively when he said he was going to the palace. I didn\u2019t know the prince would send Diana as soon as I said the emperor was about to collapse.I should have calculated the future more closely. I should have figured that Helios would act more hands-on when I informed him of my foreshadowing.\u201cPlease stop making mistakes\u2026!\u201dI bit my lip. It\u2019s a shame that Kaelus held out so firmly, wasn\u2019t it almost a big deal?In the future, if I want Diana and Helios to kneel in front of Kael, I must not be sloppy for a moment. We don\u2019t know what kind of butterfly effect a minute\u2019s mistake will cause.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He\u2019s sleeping without dinner.\u201d\u201cIs he alone in the bedroom?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s always someone watching.\u201dAs expected, a shrewd butler. I can relax.I went back to my room and went to sleep. However, I couldn\u2019t fall asleep quickly because I suffered too many emotional ups and downs all day long.The maid, who knows my inclination to not enjoy tea, put wine and wine glasses on the table instead of a teapot. How delicate. People who are fundamentally different from me try to be meticulous.Eventually, I woke up with a blanket.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI walked out to the terrace with a little wine in my hand. Would it be better to cool my head in the cool night air?I could see a quiet garden view at a glance. It is neat and harmonious even if it is not colorful. Just like Kaelus.I couldn\u2019t help laughing. Any way, my thoughts flowed and eventually went towards my favorite. It seemed natural that my life in this novel\u2019s world revolved around Kaelus.Naturally, I turned my head and looked at the other side of the mansion.\u201cEh\u2026? Kael\u2026?!\u201dI told you I was sleeping!My mind went blank for a moment. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re doing something rash on the terrace, are you?My room and Kael\u2019s bedroom were located at each end of the second floor of the mansion. The shadow of the man on the opposite terrace was unmistakably the owner of the room.As if throwing the glass, I put it on the table and ran frantically down the hall. And, somewhat out of impoliteness, I pushed the door of Kaelus\u2019 bedroom with all my might without permission.\u201c!\u201dBut what I saw in the room was,\u201cHmm? Ma\u2019am?\u201dThe butler Uross, standing in an elegant manner. Rather, I became confused.\u201cOh\u2026 on the terrace\u2026.\u201dWords stuttered out because I didn\u2019t think properly. Then, the shadow of a tall man appeared with the sound of pulling his slippers from the terrace.\u201cWhat is it? \u2026. Hestia?\u201dOh, no. You didn\u2019t mean to jump to death.My face flared up sharply when I realized my incredible delusion. At this moment, I was very grateful for the dim bedroom lights.\u201cOh, well, I had a terrible misunderstanding\u2026 I think I did\u2026.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the sudden disturbance. Good night.\u201dI bowed my head and apologized hastily. I was going to turn around and leave, but suddenly Kaelus called me to stop.\u201cWait, Hestia.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dHe spoke briefly, leaving me standing.\u201cGet out of here, Uross.\u201dThe butler bowed lightly and left the room immediately.I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m left alone with Kaelus at night without a butler. I don\u2019t know what to do because it\u2019s awkward.\u201cWhoa\u2026 Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dI\u2019m embarrassed. I felt like hiding in a rat hole because I rushed over thinking that Kaelus was jumping off.However, the voice I heard was surprisingly clear.\u201cDuring the day, I\u2019m sorry. Then I was sharp, too.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m fine!\u201dI waved my hands reflexively at the unexpected words. Still, he was quite stable compared to the day, so I spoke carefully.\u201cHow do you feel now?\u201d\u201cI feel much better after a nap.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dKaelus dragged his feet languidly to the front of the cabinet. Opening the market and taking out were two transparent wine glasses.\u201cShall we have a drink?\u201dI can\u2019t say no when you even took out your glass. I smiled awkwardly.\u201cYes, thank you.\u201d\u201cYou looked like you were drinking wine on the terrace earlier.\u201d\u201cDid you see that?\u201dIt was unexpected. I thought you wouldn\u2019t have seen it because it was far and dark. No, I was surprised to see Kaelus, that I ran inside, and I saw him holding a glass after a short time.Kaelus nodded indifferently.\u201cIsn\u2019t the moon bright?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have pretty good night vision.\u201dPouring the red liquid into the glass, he sat down on the sofa.\u201cI have a question, Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead.\u201dThe answer was simple. But at that time, what was I thinking?Oh! What luck this is! What a nice drinking party with my favorite! I felt like I was going to die of shame until a while ago, but now my heart is pounding.To be honest, it\u2019s more problematic because I keep thinking of strange? dreams and my heart flickers because it\u2019s just the two of us. The lighting in the room was vast, and my favorite was dressed in a baggy gown which showed a solid bare chest.Kael, do you have any idea what I\u2019m thinking? You could be eaten by me if you do that! I\u2019m not such a nice person. Too much beauty is harmful to the heart. If you\u2019re going to hang your long silver hair in the moonlight in the future, can you please give me a heads up? That way, won\u2019t I at least be ready?I quickly swallowed a sip of wine before the silly comments spread out randomly. I quickly returned to reality and showed a demure attitude again.Kaelus asked, looking everywhere but me.\u201cWhat you said in the carriage\u2026 Why did you say that?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dDid I say, \u2018Well done\u2019 to Kaelus?It was not a very difficult question to answer. I said with a light smile.\u201cBecause you walked out resolutely. You did not fall to the end before his majesty.\u201dKaelus laughed bitterly.\u201cWhat if that wasn\u2019t the case?\u201d\u201cEven so, it doesn\u2019t change that you\u2019re still doing well. Just being able to be outspoken like this is proof that you\u2019re doing pretty well.\u201dOriginally, it is difficult for a person to easily touch up the wounds they have received through words. Even if you can do that, it\u2019s only possible after a very long time and the wound has faded.It is fortunate that it is healed naturally by time, but in fact, it is much more often not. It can fester as it is and become a disease, or it can remain an indelible scar.So it\u2019s truly a tremendous development for Kaelus to talk about what happened this very day. To put it bluntly, isn\u2019t Diana the one who made him want to die? It is a great compliment to be able to be so calm even in the face of such an opponent.He exhaled a long breath, as if he were vomiting a lump inside.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dA calm yet dying voice echoed through the quiet space.\u201cI think every moment I open my eyes. Where did it go wrong? Why did I waste my life on such nonsense?\u2026\u201dI fully understood his feelings. I loved with all my heart, but the terrible emptiness that engulfs me right after that cannot be easily soothed by anything.\u201cTo be honest, saying that it\u2019s all a valuable experience afterwards doesn\u2019t comfort me right away. There are constant questions about whether it must have been such a painful experience or a life experience that I can learn in other ways.\u201dKaelus took a glass of wine to his lips and moistened his throat. Among them, there was an honest sadness.\u201cWas first love supposed to be like this? Why do I have to go through the ups and downs of life that others can easily go through? Why is my life so harsh? Not only in love, but in all the hardships of life, anyone would ask themselves this. Why am I the only one having a hard time?\u201dFor the person facing such pain, the clich\u00e9 of \u201clife is like that\u201d is not comforting at all. What\u2019s the point of saying that this is nothing in front of a sick person who is about to die?So I don\u2019t want to tell Kaelus the obvious.\u201cBut you proved it beautifully. That you were a hot person who knew how to have such passionate love.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus looked at me quietly. My face was a little hot, but I said what I wanted to say.\u201cSo you can be confident. No matter what kind of love you meet in your life, you will be able to truly engage in it. A person who knows how to love is a great person.\u201dFor me to realize that I\u2019m also a person who can do love. To convince myself that I\u2019m not a parched, cold, inhuman psychopath, but a \u201chuman\u201d with warm blood and warmth. The reason why I can be confident that I am enough to be treated like a human being by others.This conviction serves as a strong basis for self-esteem and a strong counterattack when someone tries to deny and degrade my existence in the future.\u201cKaelus, your love was never a useless waste.\u201dIt would have been better if it had been answered, but even if it was brutally thrown out without being answered, there was absolutely nothing to throw away.So love, in some form, is really worth doing.\u201cYou loved someone who didn\u2019t look at you so much, but how great would you be if you had a real face-to-face love? I\u2019m looking forward to your future even more.\u201dThen his lips, which were tightly closed tightly, opened.\u201cCan you see my future in your foresight?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, I was speechless. In the world before regression, Kaelus was dead, so I have no idea about his future.I glossed over it.\u201cWell\u2026 I can\u2019t see the future I want at will.\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmm. Is that so?\u201dI seemed to have convinced him somehow. That\u2019s a relief.If the prophecies continue here, I thought my bottom line would be revealed. He quickly changed the subject back to Diana.\u201cDid the Crown Princess react much?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s\u2026\u201dFortunately, Kaelus was able to bring up the situation at the time on his own. Purple eyes wandered in the air for a moment.\u201cI was surprised for a moment. I stopped walking and soon I had the courtesy of his majesty\u2026 Heli rushed over and told me what to do.\u201d\u201cActually, I was flustered, too. I didn\u2019t know that the crown prince would send his servant as soon as I told him the prophecy.. It was my mistake.\u201dI apologized frankly. Then Kaelus laughed.\u201cYou don\u2019t quite understand\u00a0 Helios\u2019 personality. He never hesitates. Unlike me.\u201d\u201cAre you jealous of that?\u201d\u201c\u2026pretty much.\u201dHe also revealed his true feelings quite frankly. My heart was touched by the meaning of trusting me that much.I opened my mouth cautiously.\u201cIf you hesitate and don\u2019t think about it properly when you have to think about it, you will pay for it later.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dYou have to be careful when you have to be careful. When you have to pause, you must do so. Otherwise, there will be a time when you will be forced to face the delayed worries and hesitations at an unwanted moment someday.Decisions without hesitation, or such, do not necessarily have only good sides. as is the case with the world.\u201cKaelus, you always make the best choice, past and present. Trust yourself a little bit more.\u201dEven if Kaelus went back in time and made a different choice in the same situation, Diana would not be his anyway. Because in this novel, Diana had already decided to be with Helios.Indeed, my favorite was fated from the start as a second lead. No matter what you do, you can never take the lead.Kaelus shook the wine glass meaninglessly. The red wine rippled round in the glass.\u201cI\u2019ve always believed that if you work hard, you\u2019ll get the fruit.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2019If you work hard, you\u2019ll do well.\u2019 \u2026 That\u2019s what I believed..\u201dI could feel the emotion in the buried behind the words. It was a deep disappointment for the world that betrayed him and Diana.\u201c\u2026\u201dSo I had no choice but to make a firm commitment once again. In the world after the ending of the novel, I will no longer let Kaelus be a sad supporting role.I forced myself to clear my tearful voice.\u201c\u2026it\u2019s late at night. Hurry up and go to bed.\u201d\u201cYou should. You should go now.\u201dHis smile is faint as if it were about to fall.My heart aches.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySoon after, the tailor, who was referred to by the lady-in-waiting, Clarice, arrived.\u201cNice to meet you, Marchioness Hestia. My name is Tekima.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 you\u2019re the tailor?\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but be surprised to see Decima. Because I thought he was a woman! But the person who appeared in front of me was a young man who showed off his ample livelihood.He pulled out his handkerchief and wiped his forehead, looking a little nervous.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s my first time to be commissioned by a lady, so my manners may be poor. Please be generous and understand\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s\u2026 It\u2019s not that big of a deal\u2026.\u201dHe managed to pull himself together and spoke in a calmer tone.\u201cIf you\u2019re good enough, it doesn\u2019t matter who you\u2019ve worked with.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dTekima bowed deeply, apologetically.I quite liked the sketch he brought. However, since the material I was going to provide was not valuable in the first place, it was hard to feel like a high-quality fabric.Tekima seemed to have a similar idea.\u201cIf you can focus your attention on something else, you won\u2019t care about the material of the fabric.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dTekima furrowed his brow and waved his hands slightly like doing a little dance.\u201cThere\u2019s something that can shine\u2026.\u201dI realized his intentions at once. You\u2019re talking about the glitter effect!Cosmetics such as glitter powder can be easily solved, but it was very expensive in this world. It was because it was really a cosmetic made by grinding jewelry.But I won\u2019t put it on my face anyway, so what\u2019s the matter? It is not difficult to find a way to produce a similar effect.\u201cLet\u2019s powder the glass. Small enough not to get hurt. Will that work?\u201d\u201cOh! Good idea, marchioness!\u201dThe difficulty of Tekima has been solved. As soon as I thought of it, I proceeded quickly afterwards.\u201cThe dress will sparkle every time you get sunlight by applying glass powder all over the fabric. And since it\u2019s a dark purple background, I\u2019m going to make a bright frill at the end of the sleeve. Of course, the frill is not simple. I\u2019m going to embroider it delicately.\u201dAs he continued his explanation with a lot of concentration, his way of speaking gradually eased away from strict etiquette. However, I did not bother to point that out. Both Tekima and I were uncomfortable with excessive formality because we were not born aristocrats.I asked suddenly jokingly.\u201cWho\u2019s in charge of embroidery?\u201d\u201cOf course I am. Do you have a pattern you want?\u201dTequima replied without hesitation. It\u2019s hard to imagine at first glance that that big man does delicate embroidery, but that\u2019s all my prejudice.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. You can embroider snakes as long as they look good on my dress.\u201dHe looked at me grimly, but I was perfectly calm.\u201cI\u2019m serious. I don\u2019t want to be overly delicate.\u201d\u201cI see. I\u2019ll keep that in mind, marchioness.\u201dThe discussion of the design is mainly over. Tekima quickly carried onto the next task.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019ll measure you. Forgive me if I touch the marchioness a little.\u201dThe maid who was next to him approached and assisted Tekima. Thanks to this, the number of direct contact with Tekima has been much reduced. He carefully folded the carefully numbered paper and put it in the inside pocket of his coat.I spoke to Tekima.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a room in my house to work. If you need assistance, talk to the butler and bring him over.\u201d\u201cOh, I have no assistant. I like to work alone. But I\u2019ll never be late for your order.\u201dTekima\u2019s expression was confident. The attitude was not so bad that I nodded pleasantly.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll trust you.\u201dWhen all the business was done, the maid took Tekima out to guide him to his studio.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI picked up a sketch of the dress on the table. He was as good as the famous tailor who dealt with the aristocracy.A harmonious blend of purple and silver. Perhaps it was a design considering that I was the spouse of Kaelus. If it is made well, there will be a great work that can stand out at the tea party.\u201cIsn\u2019t this really cost-effective?\u201d\u201dI looked into the sketch again, admiring myself. How beautiful it would be if it was completed and seen in person. I was already excited just thinking about it.The tailor, Tekima, started working on the dress. In the meantime, I went to Madame Harmonia\u2019s salon.I used to drop by every few days to keep my promise with Harmonia. Again, there was no specific purpose. Nevertheless, if I listened carefully among people, I would get a lot of useful information. There was often high-quality information that I could not get by just the news of the salon she regularly sends me.Besides, these days, the social world is in full swing with Diana\u2019s second tea party. There is much more to gain than sitting inside the house.\u201cWelcome, Marchioness Hestia.\u201d\u201cWhoa, thank you for always welcoming me like this, madam.\u201dFamiliar faces greeted me here and there. I also sat at a nearby table, replying lightly.Harmonia knew my taste in tea and prepared coffee instead. One day, I implicitly said, \u201cI like coffee more than tea,\u201d and since then, I have only been served coffee. It was very fortunate for me.Harmonia spoke in a subtle tone to enjoy the savory aroma of coffee.\u201cI heard you became an aide to the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cOh, you mean that.\u201dI expected the rumor to spread by now. I answered calmly without being surprised.\u201cI don\u2019t have much talent, but I guess he thought my ability was quite useful.\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026.\u201dHarmonia was impressed.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the situation on the Illion estate has improved greatly since the marchioness took charge of the marquis. The praises are all over the place.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dWhat kind of news is this? I can\u2019t believe the people of Ilion like it.Perhaps I really didn\u2019t hear it for the first time, Harmonia laughed, covering her lips.\u201cMarquis Kaelus has a very good eye.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s strange that Kaelus is suddenly praised here, but whatever it is, it\u2019s good. There\u2019s no harm in getting my favorite a bonus thanks to me.She smiled. This time I asked.\u201cBy the way, how is her highness the crown princess doing these days? At first glance, it seems that she is not very well off with the old ladies in the palace\u2026\u201dI heard it with my own ears on my way to meet Helios, so what\u2019s the point? However, I deliberately expressed it as if it were a rumor.Harmonia had a strange smile.\u201cThe preparations for the tea party are going smoothly. There\u2019s something else that makes her suffer.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dShe was very kind to Diana. I\u2019m very curious about what kind of charm Diana had. Kindness? Pureness? Thoughtfulness? But whatever it is, sooner or later, it will be smashed by me.Fortunately, Harmonia doesn\u2019t know yet that I\u2019m Diana\u2019s enemy. It remains to be seen how the attitude will change after the tea party, but at least she\u2019s kind to me now.\u201cDo you mean a disturbing voice for her, madam?\u201dI asked, pretending to be innocent. Harmonia closed her eyes gently without smiling.\u201cThe marchioness knows, too. Don\u2019t you have your ears open in many places?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s become a habit to pick up even the smallest words. I feel like I have to survive in this world.\u201dI was obediently positive. Knowing that I was a commoner, she must have been easily convinced.As expected, Harmonia nodded and agreed with me.\u201cYou are a wise woman. lady marquis. If her highness had been more free, she could have behaved like lady marquis..\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean she can\u2019t move freely? Are you saying that her highness is locked up somewhere?\u201dI pretended to be surprised, but there was something in my mind. Perhaps because of my prediction that the emperor was about to collapse, Diana was stuck to the emperor.Harmonia sighed quietly.\u201cUnexpectedly, the palace is prone to darkening eyes and ears. And there\u2019s a limit to how you behave.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t quite understand. She\u2019s the highest woman in the country, what do you mean by a disturbing voice?\u201dHer smile subsided bitterly.\u201cI can\u2019t tell you the details, but her majesty has a lot of burdens. There aren\u2019t many people to comfort her.\u201d\u201cHer highness and madam. Don\u2019t you exchange letters with your highness from time to time? I think your highness will be very reassured to have madam.\u201dI answered back and lowered the corners of my eyes.It\u2019s not easy to get a grip. I need more method acting.Harmonia\u2019s lips were lonesome.\u201cMy power is very poor to help her. And the limits are clear.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the end, her highness has no choice but to overcome it herself. All I can give her is a little bit of advice.\u201d\u201cMadam must be very upset because you care about her.\u201d\u201cWhoo\u2026 but she\u2019ll do a good job. She\u2019s done that before.\u201dHarmonia has shown infinite trust in Diana.I laughed but felt uncomfortable inside. The novel is already over, but how long will she give this unconditional affection to Diana?So I asked Harmonia a slightly provocative question.\u201cBut what if the crown princess can\u2019t live up to madame\u2019s expectations?\u201dIn fact, it might be better to shut up and stay still to disguise my true feelings. But if I stay still, I\u2019ll feel sick to my stomach.Harmonia\u2019s eyes also narrowed slightly.\u201cLike the story that goes around the rumor?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dThe rumor started with a word that Countess Erinnis dropped at a social gathering.It was the fear of Diana\u2019s lack of qualifications and incompetence and the prediction that the commoner-born crown princess would be obsessed with stratification and ostracize the nobles.I rolled my eyes with embarrassment.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to listen, but there\u2019s a lot of talk here and there\u2026.\u201dHarmonia stared at me with her back straightened.\u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen for a long time, her majesty was well qualified to be the national mother of this country. It\u2019s hard to meet everyone\u2019s expectations at once. But over time, everyone will have to admit it.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dShe gave me a sneer at my disagreeing tone.\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to believe my words, marchioness.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s not like that. It\u2019s just an appreciation from my personal experience\u2026.\u201dI deliberately wore a lonesome smile then.\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dOnly then did Harmonia seem to recall my pink diamond ring incident. Diana recognized the ring I was wearing at the time at once, and hinted to me that it was something that had a connection with her in the past.\u201cEven if you just want to think you made a simple mistake, that\u2019s how people will feel.\u201dHer eyebrows drooped at my bitter tone.\u201cLady Hestia, please don\u2019t worry too much about it. Her highness has certainly recognized you, and she is a good-natured man, and she probably won\u2019t repeat the same mistake.\u201dThat\u2019s enough to hear Harmonia speak for Diana.\u201cPhew, I hope so.\u201dI grinned on purpose.On the day of Diana\u2019s tea party, it was held a little after noon as a tea party.Preparations were naturally made early in the morning, and thanks to this, the marquis were very busy.The dress, which was reborn in the hands of the tailor, Tekima, finally came to life.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dIt was a sight that I couldn\u2019t help admiring honestly. Not only me but also the\u00a0 lady-in-waiting Clarice, who introduced him, was full of laughter.\u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful change, marchioness!\u201d\u201cI know. I don\u2019t even remember what this dress was like.\u201dI had no choice but to respond. The dark purple fabric stayed, and a translucent silver frill flowed gracefully over it. And thanks to the glass powder all over the fabric, even if you move a little, it sparkled under the light. The skirt hem, which was spread somewhat abundantly, was slightly folded, giving off a more mature atmosphere.Like declaring myself no longer a noble love, but a noble lady leading a family.Tekima displayed his talent with incredible confidence that he was first commissioned by an aristocrat.\u201cGreat job, Tekima.\u201dThere was no need to make a fuss over a compliment. Tekima responded by bowing.\u201cI am very grateful to the marchioness for her satisfaction.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure everyone would believe it was a new dress.\u201dShe said, careful not to look too excited. Then Tekima\u2019s answer was another masterpiece.\u201cIf you had ordered me to do so, I would have shown the marchioness a satisfactory work. If you ask me again sometime, I\u2019ll meet your expectations.\u201dI quite liked his confidence. Next time, I should really order a new dress.In time, I began to dress up in earnest.Without a word, I sat in front of the dressing table and entrusted myself to the hands of the ladies. As I tried to close my eyes still, When I tried to close my eyes, I had a lot of thoughts in my head. They\u2019re gone.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe tea party was basically a place to go alone without a partner. But only one person was likely to break the practice.Diana.What if Helios, who has a strong love for his wife, showed up together to help Diana, ignoring the custom?If she really does, Diana will avoid a war of nerves with the aristocracy right now, but after the tea party, she will be considered as an incompetent royal who can\u2019t do anything alone. If she knows how to think, she\u2019ll never bring Helios to a tea party.Today, I\u2019m going to show you how petty your morality is, Diana.\u201cMadam marquis, how do you like this hairstyle?\u201d\u201cI like it. Alright.\u201dA dexterous young maid smiled and nodded at the answer. Encouraged, she went back to work with a face full of enthusiasm.\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dObviously, it\u2019s gonna be a great tea party.After finishing all the tailoring, I tried to go down the stairs as I was, but suddenly I stopped walking.\u201c\u2026\u201dI wore a new dress for the first time in a while and my hair was smooth, but it felt a little wasteful to just go out.I stared at the bedroom door of Kaelus, which was opposite my room. As usual, it was not completely closed and slightly opened. If I show my face even for a moment before I get in the carriage\u2026?The young maid next to me looked at me alternately and spoke to me.\u201cShall I see if the marquis is in the room, ma\u2019am?\u201d\u201c\u2026Should I?\u201dWhether she knew or didn\u2019t know that I was a little hesitant, the maid walked to the other side of the hallway at a bullet-like speed.She pushed her head into the open door, delayed for a while, and soon turned around me and smiled. Then she quickly came back to me.\u201cStay inside!\u201dIt was a whispering tone, but I felt enough excitement. I think she likes it more than I do.Eventually, I headed to Kaelus\u2019 room in a full outfit.\u201cKaelus.\u201dWhen I appeared, the servant inside immediately rose to greet me. Kaelus was enjoying the mild weather on the terrace.A white face, always expressionless, glanced at me.\u201cWas today a tea party?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be back.\u201dI don\u2019t want to ask you how the dress is and if my hair looks good. However, I am satisfied with just showing him my well-decorated appearance. In fact, the person I want to show the most beautifully dressed up is my precious favorite. Not Diana or any other aristocrats.Kaelus responded with a light nod.\u201cOkay, go ahead.\u201dA very simple greeting. Without that common compliment, it was just saying, \u2018Have a safe trip.\u2019But I don\u2019t have to be upset at all. Because there is only one woman that Kaelus said was beautiful. It\u2019s the heroine of the novel, Diana. His love, the only one in the world, that took the whole heart of a second-So I really think this is enough. by the way.\u201cThat dress looks good on you.\u201d\u201c!\u201dMy heart sank.\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201dTruly I, this is enough.Thanks to my foresight that the emperor was about to collapse, Diana\u2019s tea party was held in the main palace where the emperor lived, not in the residence of the Crown Princess.The ladies entering the hall one after another expressed considerable surprise.\u201cHis majesty must have quite a lot of faith in her.\u201d\u201cEven so, it\u2019s incredibly shocking I\u2019ve never heard of the crown princess\u2019 tea party being held in the emperor\u2019s residence.\u201d\u201cIs his majesty going to appear?\u201d\u201cOh, I really don\u2019t think so!\u201dA little further away from them, I was still listening to a fussy conversation.\u201c\u2026.\u201dThose who do not know the prophecy naturally took it that way. It\u2019s getting on my nerves for some reason.I don\u2019t even like this little moment when Diana\u2019s skill is praised by the nobles. This is not her ability. It\u2019s all thanks to my prophecy.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dI was a little surprised at myself. In fact, Diana was not this unlikable when I read the original novel.A confident and clear-minded heroine. A refreshing character who gives you cider every time. To be honest, who would read the rofan novel to the end if the heroine was too busy to be immersed in the plot? One of the reasons why I was able to binge read this novel nine times is, of course, Kaelus, but it would have been impossible if the heroine was in the way every time I binge read it.However, now I am deeply realizing the realistic reality of Cider Diana in rofan. A naive idealist who has walked a flower path all her life without much hardship.Just as I was lost in my thoughts, Countess Erinnis arrived.\u201cLady Hestia.\u201dShe walked straight to me, lightly responding to greetings from all over. Naturally, people\u2019s attention was also directed toward us.With a calm smile, I also responded to the countess.\u201cYou\u2019re here, Countess Erinnis.\u201dShe whispered in a low voice.\u201cAs promised before, I will be your true ally to the marquis today.\u201d\u201cWhoa, I remember that. The Countess must rescue the holy lady today.\u201dWhen I push Diana into trouble, Erinnis will cut in at the right time and save her. It was what we agreed upon when I visited her house the other day.Society is literally a battlefield. Even if it is temporary, it is quite reassuring that there is an alliance.Nevertheless, Erinnis said in a slightly worried voice.\u201cBut in his majesty\u2019s palace, will it work?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be fine. I don\u2019t think his majesty or the crown prince will guard the tea party. That would only prove the crown princess\u2019 incompetence.\u201dPerhaps my words were quite helpful, because the corners of the Countess\u2019s mouth crept up.\u201cAs expected, you are the marquis\u2019 wife. He\u2019s an extraordinary man.\u201d\u201cWell, since the countess, who is known for her skill, says so, I\u2019m at a loss.\u201dIt must have been interesting to see us talking secretly. Before I knew it, there were a lot of people around. I and Erinnis exchanged significant glances and turned to the people who approached.\u201cEveryone, this is Marchioness Hestia. There are a lot of people you\u2019re seeing for the first time, right?\u201dI posed with dignity to the introduction of Erinnis.\u201cNice to meet you all. I\u2019m Hestia, Marquis Kaelus\u2019 companion.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dThe attention of the hall was focused on me\u00a0 in an instant. Curious eyes directed at me, but fortunately, I don\u2019t feel much malice. Maybe it\u2019s because I have Erinnis next to me.This is not a bad start.\u201cHer Highness Diana, the crown princess of the empire, is coming in!\u201dThe murmur ceased. The nobles rose from their seats in unison. Following those who were modestly courteous, I bowed toward the saint.The crunching sound of her shoes somehow feels arrogant.\u201cStand up.\u201dI looked up at Diana.Beautiful pink hair flowed gracefully, creating a goddess-like atmosphere. The sea-colored eyes literally shone like jewels.She\u2019s the best beauty in this world. At least there is no more beautiful thing in the world than Diana. Because the creator of this world, the author of the novel, wanted it.I suddenly became curious. What would the writer think of me hating the heroine? Will they be upset?\u201c\u2026.\u201dI quickly shook off my thoughts. I shouldn\u2019t think too much n the middle of this battlefield in front of Diana. I\u2019m in trouble because I keep getting out of the habit of watching novels as an extra.Diana sat down. Then the nobles sat down again.\u201cIt\u2019s very nice to meet you all like this. I hope everyone has a great time.\u201dThe elderly women responded with dignity first.\u201cI wish the royal family and crown princess the best. Thank you very much for inviting me today, your highness.\u201dMy seat was pretty close to Diana. It seemed to be a placement considering the status of my spouse, Kaelus. And next to me sat Countess Erinnis.I also greeted Diana with a smile on my face.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you like this at the emperor\u2019s palace. His majesty seems to care very much about you.\u201dThen she backed up my words as if she had been waiting.\u201cI know, your grace! Wouldn\u2019t you be surprised?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to your high reputation. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dDiana looked at me rather nervously. Is it because of the experience that made my heart ache every time I faced her? The lips are in the arc, but the eyes are not.\u201cI\u2019m just grateful for your kindness. I was also very surprised.\u201dShe answered the people in ceremonial terms.Soon after, a tray loaded with refreshments came into each table. A splendidly plated refreshment plate was also prepared on our table, where I, Countess Erinnis and Diana were sitting.But since then, the atmosphere has become strange.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe fact that refreshments are \u201cfancy\u201d was only evaluated by my personal standards, not for those who have lived as nobles all their lives.The faces of the ladies hardened little by little. There were people who looked at the plates and exchanged glances between themselves, while there were people with significant smiles.Diana had been said to have been at odds with the court lady, Madame Merope, over the preparation for the tea party, but she seemed to have 'simple\u201d as she wished.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dI heard an exclamation from somewhere that I didn\u2019t know if it was an exclamation or a sigh.In fact, anything can\u2019t be ignored as an expectation.As for the tea party, it was the first official social event for the Crown Princess, except for meetings with close people. In addition, even the place was the home of the emperor.Even if the invited nobles did not expect it, Diana should have had enough \u201cfancy\u201d to fit in as a host who knew in advance that the event would take place at the royal palace.Before the tea party, the expectations were already high. All that was set up in front of them was plain cakes and cookies that emphasized frugality, and tea that was readily available to any rich aristocrat.\u201c\u2026\u201dI looked silently at the dishes placed one by one on the table.If Diana wanted to convey her message to our nobles, she should have been wiser.Her intention to criticize the luxury of the aristocracy should not have been so blatant. She succeeded in turning all the invitations \u2013 all the good nobles \u2013 into enemies before she could even bring up a word.Rather, there was a way to take symbolism from the ingredients of food, or to select a patissier from a commoner, not from a noble family. Or they could reinterpret the refreshments enjoyed by the common people in a aristocratic way.If so, the nobles would have warmed up to the royal mercy\u2019s hospitality and listened with a more open mind to what she was going to say.The truth is that you have to respect the other person first to persuade them. You\u2019re right, so you can\u2019t convince your opponent by taking the wrong approach. Even if your thoughts are truly \u2018right\u2019.We don\u2019t want anyone to look down and teach us. We want to be respected for the way we\u2019ve lived, and to be introduced to other paths that we\u2019ve never known.Therefore, Diana. You\u2019re going too far.It was arrogant.The air in the banquet hall became cold before I knew it. No one opened their mouth first to break the ice-cold atmosphere.Diana, on the other hand, smiled gracefully.\u201cThese are the refreshments that I carefully chose for you. Please enjoy it.\u201dIt\u2019s time for me to step up.I broke the ice with a loud welcome.\u201cOh, these are really nostalgic snacks! Your highness must have prepared this for me, especially with my origin in mind. It may seem very simple to the others here.\u201dThere is a bone in the horse.* Even I, a native commoner, hinted that this table setting did not fit in front of the nobles.*TN: as in there\u2019s something wrongDid Diana prepare for this from the beginning? Her expression was grim as if she were going to battle.\u201cAs crown princess who should\u00a0 set an example for all the imperialists in this country, I have prepared tea and cake in hopes that you will live the same way as me. It may be a little awkward now, but I hope you get used to it soon.\u201dFirst, I answered politely.\u201cEveryone here must have realized your deep meaning. I will always remember what you want us to do.\u201dHowever, I said I wouldn\u2019t forget, but I didn\u2019t say I would follow it.Diana\u2019s sea-colored eyes turned straight at me.\u201cYes, I was sure you\u2019d understand what I meant, Marchioness Hestia.\u201dI smiled softly and bowed my head.Diana raised her head resolutely and opened her mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s enjoy the refreshments\u201dThe party began in earnest with awkward smiles blooming at the order of the Crown Princess.Tea parties could have been said to be successful only when laughter bloomed at each table. Everyone somehow filled the cups with tea, and each made a chattering sound, desperately continuing to keep the excitement from cooling down.I opened my mouth as I glanced around.\u201cToday Madame Merope doesn\u2019t seem to be taking care of you.\u201dDiana answered me with a rather stiff look.\u201cYes, she\u2019s doing something else. But why do you ask that?\u201dOh, no. Are you really asking because you don\u2019t know? Madame Merope has no idea what kind of position the court lady-in-waiting is.\u201cThat\u2019s because Madame Merope rarely leaves the most noble royal family. Especially on such a big occasion\u2026\u201dWhen I took my chance, I wondered if it was time, and only then some ladies quietly added questions.\u201cIsn\u2019t your highness the crown princess the greatest person in the palace while the empress is away? I\u2019m not sure where she is..\u201d\u201cMadame Merope is a very proud person. She was very proud of serving the noble people for decades.\u201d\u201cBut she didn\u2019t show up here, so it\u2019s very strange for us who have seen her in this palace for a long time, your highness.\u201dEveryone says this, but you may actually guess. Merope had been at odds with Diana throughout the preparation of the event, feeling uncomfortable with the occasion and either resigned from the tea party himself or was ruled out by Diana\u2019s order.Countess Erinnis gave me a sneaking wink. I\u2019ll give you the floor quietly, so say what you want.After receiving the signal from my eyes, I decided to start the plan.\u201cYour highness, may I ask you a question, but did Madame Merope go against your will?\u201dDiana slowly turned to me.\u201cHestia. Does it look like that?\u201dI answered, bowing my head and avoiding her gaze.\u201cTo be honest, yes. I\u2019m afraid she didn\u2019t approve of showing your will as a party.\u201d\u201cYou sound quite familiar with the Merope. I didn\u2019t think you have much experience with the Imperial Palace.\u201dDoes she think I\u2019m not familiar with the palace? What the hell do you think I am?\u201cI can\u2019t be ignorant just because I have no experience. I apologize if you find my question invasive, your highness the crown princess.\u201dLook at this. You shouldn\u2019t be so obvious when you get an uncomfortable question. She may have practiced to look like the royal family somehow, but she\u2019s just like she used to be.At that time, Countess Erinnis, sitting at the same table, helped me.\u201cYes, your highness. In fact, we\u2019ve been curious all along. Madame Merope was a very loyal figure. I was worried about why hes didn\u2019t show up here and if she was sick.\u201dThere is no way to avoid her as she has helped her with her reputation in society.Diana was forced to speak.\u201cThe old habits of the lady-in-waiting don\u2019t fit me. So she\u2019s not supporting me at this party today. That doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s going to be very relieved of her responsibilities. She\u2019s still doing her job elsewhere.\u201dErinnis nodded with satisfaction.\u201cWell, looking at the table today, I see. I didn\u2019t feel much of Madame\u2019s touch.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be too uncomfortable with it. The chef is still very good, and above all, I hope my will will serve as a model for you.\u201dDiana smiled softly.She didn\u2019t seem to think anything was wrong. No, she wouldn\u2019t mind if things didn\u2019t work out as intended.Because the heroine of a rofan novel has her own characteristics. That is, to not care about the reaction of others at all.During the original work, no matter what stubbornness she had \u2013 someone would accept it as a \u2018faith\u2019, all the results were in her favor. The route that can only be considered cider no matter what.But now the novel is over. And the heroine doesn\u2019t know.\u201cMarquis Kaelus has been away for a while, is there any reason?\u201dI naturally answered someone\u2019s question.\u201cDidn\u2019t my husband work tirelessly? He\u2019s suddenly tired all at once, so he\u2019s taking a break for a while.\u201d\u201cOh, my\u2026.\u201dPeople\u2019s eyes sparkled with curiosity. What kind of person is the only marchioness of the empire who suddenly appeared one day? She seems anxious to ask me this and that.In addition, it is a tea party at the Imperial Palace attended by all the noble ladies in the capital. All my social activities have been the invitation of Countess Erinius and the entrance of Madame Harmonia\u2019s salon. So there must be a lot of unanswered questions.Their attention, of course, was focused on me. And the question that everyone was most curious about came out.\u201cIs Marquis Kaelus nice to his wife?\u201dAs soon as I heard this question, I deliberately glanced at Diana. Those who have not taken their eyes off me may have noticed my movements.I don\u2019t have to pretend to be a beloved wife in front of them. Everyone knows it anyway. That Kaelus loves Diana.\u201cAs a spouse, I am endlessly respected. I also respect my husband as a wise and wonderful person.\u201dThen the Countess of Erinnis pointed out in a stern voice.\u201cBut he\u2019s also a very cruel man. Her highness the other day was very angry.\u201dI admired it in my heart. I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s such a good team mate. The countess laid out the board with great skill so that I could start the conversation I wanted.If then,\u201cEven so, I don\u2019t blame my husband\u2019s choice.\u201dMy remarks, which came out rather boldly, turned things quiet around me.Even high-ranking nobles need courage to openly express their opposition in front of the crown princess. But now that the duke of Orcus is extinct, there is no higher title in the empire than the marquis.Although I\u2019m a commoner and I have a handicap as an adopted daughter of the marginal lord of Elea, such a thing can easily be crushed into my current position.Diana, who was deliberately dragged out by Erinnis. There is my opinion completely contrary to her usual beliefs.Diana\u2019s sea-colored eyes were directed straight at me.\u201cYou seem to have something to say to me, Hestia.\u201dAs expected, she came upfront. Indeed, even in the original work, Diana was good at popping cider by not saying what she had to say.So the time to confront her is right now, without the Helios shield.\u201cWith all due respect, yes. Your highness the crown princess.\u201dI returned a bitter smile to Diana, who accepted my challenge.Her expression hardened.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s hear it.\u201dI can feel the conceit of a person who has never doubted their morals. Confidence, or arrogance, that I can break everything no matter what logic I make.Then shall we fight?\u201cIn fact, I think the current imperial politics have been stabilized by the decision of my husband, Marquis Kaelus. As your Highness knows, wasn\u2019t the power of Duke Orchus equal to that of the emperor?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDiana waited calmly for my words. I continued, careful not to raise my voice.\u201cMy husband has nipped the buds coldly, so I can enjoy the peace that I have now. In fact, everyone here knows how much the late Princess Letona used to look down on and confront your highness.\u201dDiana\u2019s eyes were strained.\u201cThe Marquis Kaelus did something very cruel. Whatever consequences it may have in the future, what is not right is wrong. The result should not justify the means, Marchioness Hestia.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s strange. Your highness, some people say you reap what you sow\u2026. Shouldn\u2019t the words of the wicked deserve to be miserable? That\u2019s the right thing, the moral end.\u201dThe end of the rofan novel must be miserable. You must pay the price of your misdeeds.There can be no end to forgiveness. In front of readers who want cider, there are only a series of comments saying that there are a million sweet potatoes.**TN: slang for something frustratingIt\u2019s not a good ending to end up in prison with a moderate and realistic finish. The character who plays the villain must be punished mercilessly enough to never continue their life again.Therefore, Kaelus\u2019 decision in the novel is bound to be the right thing to do here.I tried to suppress my anger inside.\u201cThe world is very complicated by nature, so don\u2019t they tell you to listen to both sides even if there\u2019s a fight? What\u2019s more, it\u2019s my husband\u2019s business?\u201d\u201cIt gets more complicated because I think it\u2019s complicated. In fact, good and evil are not very complicated matters, Marchioness Hestia.\u201dDiana said, looking at me confidently.I had no choice but to click my tongue inside. How can she be so naive? It\u2019s a word that feels like a beginner in society who has never suffered in life, or more than that, has not experienced social life for a long time.Perhaps she didn\u2019t like my attitude of disagreement, Diana once again made her point in a patient tone.\u201cIt\u2019s not that hard to live right when you get to know it. We\u2019ve already learned a lot from childhood to now, what\u2019s right. You all know the teachings of the temple and the words of the old sages, or, if not necessarily, what good things are for all people, right?\u201d\u201cSo my husband, Marquis Kaelus, made a difficult decision for the righteous saint and for the royal family of this empire. The wicked Duchess Orcus\u2019 actions were revealed with evidence to pay for their crimes.\u201dMore explicitly, thanks to my favorite Kaelus, the emperor was able to kill the problem without blood on his hands. From the perspective of the emperor and Helios, he was clearly a loyalist to the empire.Because he came forward and took the lead and punished Princess Letona, Helios was able to eventually hold his beloved Diana in his arms to avoid a terrible political marriage. At least Helios had the right to advise her, who criticized Kaelus, that she should not be criticizing Kaelus.Because of Kaelus\u2019 abandonment of his love affair, this world, this novel,I was able to go to the \u201cRight Way\u201d of the rofan novel called \u201cHappy Ending.\u201dNevertheless, Diana shook her head.\u201cEven so, Marquis Kaelus killed the Duchess Orcus. You don\u2019t think that\u2019s acceptable, do you, marchioness?\u201dIt would be unacceptable if it was an ordinary person who drank poison tea, but the problem was that they were thoroughly evil.I deliberately lowered my head in a humble manner.\u201cSo what was your idea? How the Duke Orcus and Princess Letona had to pay\u2026.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t there a national law? Of course it should have followed.\u201dDiana\u2019s tone was emphatic.A bitter smile came out of itself. How nice it would be if everything in the world was so simple that there was an answer.I had a slow plan.\u201cAs many of you know\u2026\u201dI covered my lips shyly.\u201cI\u2019m the daughter of Lord Elea in the distance. And I lived with commoners until I married the marquis.\u201dThe banquet hall was so quiet that I couldn\u2019t hear a breath. Before I knew it, everyone at the tea party was listening to me.\u201cI\u2019ve heard about a terrible incident on that street. A woman brutally murdered a young boy.\u201dIt\u2019s a roughly made up story. I don\u2019t know if this really happened in this world.\u201cHow would you judge her?\u201dThis case, ostensibly described as very simple. Diana replied with an expression as if she had nothing to think deeply about.\u201cShe\u2019s a cruel woman to kill a helpless child.\u201dI nodded my head.\u201cThat\u2019s what it looks like. But there was a very surprising truth behind it. Your Highness.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\u201cShe had a little daughter. She was a pretty girl, one or two years younger than the boy she killed.\u201dLet\u2019s catch our breath here.\u201c\u2026 It turned out that the boy was the murdered raped her little girl.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cOh, my!\u201d\u201cOh, my\u2026!\u201dSighs broke out all over the table. Diana also opened her eyes wide and did not hide her surprise.In fact, it\u2019s not a very fake story. In the reality that I used to live in, more disastrous events made the news day by day.It\u2019s been a long time since a child\u2019s abuse has become a common crime.I made up a fictional revenge play on an already existing event and made a slight adaptation.\u201cYour majesty the crown princess, how do you feel? Is the mother really cruel?\u201dI looked up\u00a0 and asked Diana.\u201c\u2026\u201dDiana couldn\u2019t open her mouth easily.An excited lady\u2019s voice popped out first.\u201cHe deserves to die!\u201dUnrefined rough language popped out, but no one blamed it. Even Countess Erinnis said with a pale countenance.\u201cIf I were that mother, I would have done anything to the person who trampled on my little girl, marchioness.\u201d\u201cI agree, Countess.\u201dI nodded my head gently, taking her word.\u201cWell, let\u2019s get back to that. Is the woman who murdered the little boy truly immoral?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dPeople became quiet.I said, looking straight at Diana.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dDiana\u2019s fine eyebrows were slightly distorted.\u201c\u2026I understand the mother\u2019s feelings.\u201dShe reluctantly managed to come up with an answer. But he added immediately.\u201cBut if everyone does their revenge in private like that, society will be very disorganized. To prevent that, there is something called national law. To prevent the world from becoming lawless.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201d\u201cIn the case of what the marchioness said, the mother couldn\u2019t resist the momentary anger. She should have turned the little boy over to the security office with a more sober mind. That\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201dI tilted my head to the side.\u201cOf course she called the security services. But the boy was released because he was young. When you\u2019re young, you can make mistakes without knowing it.\u201dThis is also one of the most common events in my world. I made it extreme to make an impact, but anyway.Diana\u2019s expression slowly distorted.I spoke coldly to her, who could not immediately refute it.\u201cYour highness knows well, don\u2019t you? It\u2019s hard to get the rich and powerless commoners to follow the strict laws of the country. Your highness, who once was with the common people, knows that there are many obstacles rather than help.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cWe reported those who had broken the law, believing in justice, but the only thing that came back was coldness. How desperate the mother must have felt\u2026.\u201dDiana looked at me with a white face. Now you realize what I want to say?\u201cYou can\u2019t jump to conclusions about morality or dishonesty, your highness the crown princess.\u201dI purposely relaxed my voice.\u201cYour highness has condemned my husband as cruel, but I am sorry that you have said so, even though no one else knows.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe sea-colored eyes had a complex glow.I beg you, Diana.I hope you don\u2019t judge too easily whether it\u2019s your humble morality or justice.My favorite tried to give up his life because of your hasty conclusions.I looked around slowly and said.\u201cWhat is morality that we actually believe in? Doesn\u2019t affection and injustice change here and there depending on what circumstances the person to judge has?\u201dI think I heard something like a low moan somewhere.I continued with a slight sneer.\u201cSomeone who only knows that a woman killed a boy in the previous incident will blame her, but someone who knows the other side will defend her. After all, this is the moral judgment that humans make.\u201dDiana\u2019s complexion was frightening.It\u2019s the first time you\u2019ve been so openly rejected, right? Even in the original novel, she didn\u2019t get reprimanded\u00a0 very much. Who dared to say a hateful thing to a saint who has wonderful healing power?But I am the only marquis wife in the country, official aide to the crown prince, and the only one who, like her, has a special \u2018ability\u2019.I already saw the ending of the novel. The days when she was the main character are gone.So Diana\u2019s pop-up cider, there can be no more.Now it was time to call attention.\u201c\u2026\u201dI winked at Countess Erinnis. Recognizing my signal, she opened her mouth as she cleared her throat.\u201cNow that I see it, Marchioness Hestia, you are a great hostess of the marquis. I understood at once why the Marquis Kaelus took the marchioness as his companion.\u201d\u201cWhoa, don\u2019t mention it.\u201dI gently covered my lips with my hand as I replied. Would it have looked like I was shy?But the role of Countess Erinnis was not to lift me up, but to comfort Diana.\u201cHowever, I think you used some profane words toward the extremely high crown princess. Shouldn\u2019t the marchioness treat the elders of the imperial family with respect as nobles like us?\u201dI bowed my head gently.\u201cCountess Erinnis is right a hundred times. I was young and I committed a great disrespect to the crown princess. Please forgive me, your highness.\u201dDiana remained stiff and said nothing. Inevitably, Erinnis once again spoke to me in a stern tone.\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s the job of a subordinate to bring up a topic that your highness would be embarrassed about. The marchioness is also a wise woman, so please be a little more careful afterwards.\u201d\u201cYes, thank you very much for your generous advice, countess.\u201dThis painting was not too awkward because Erinnis was much older than me.After bowing to her, I looked at Diana again. I got up from my seat, bent my knees slightly, and lowered myself more firmly.\u201cYour highness the crown princess. I realize my mistake, so please take your anger back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Hestia.\u201dDiana struggled to speak.I answered immediately.\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d\u201cI fully understand why you are so upset.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cKael is still struggling a lot.\u201dI almost burst out laughing. Who dares to abbreviate another woman\u2019s husband\u2019s name in public?\u201cI understand your sorrow, so leave it at that for today, Hestia.\u201d\u201cI do not know what to do with your great generosity. It\u2019s amazing.\u201dLet\u2019s wrap it up properly. Let\u2019s be satisfied that we pushed Diana this much today.I decided to get out of the awkward situation. I asked for her understanding in a polite way.\u201cI\u2019ll be back after I cool my head for a while, your highness the crown princess.\u201d\u201cOkay, go ahead.\u201dDiana also gave the green light.I walked quickly with an embarrassing smile toward the people looking at me. I felt the persistent gaze behind me, but I didn\u2019t look backI came out of the banquet hall.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dWhen I sighed out loud, the guards looked at me in wonder. But I didn\u2019t care.I sat on a platform supporting the corridor post.I chuckled to myself.I rubbed Diana of her dignity in public. I felt like I did one of the big things I had to do here.\u201cTsk\u2026.\u201dThere are some things that are a little disappointing. I wish I were a character who gave a big shot of cider like Diana in the original.But you can\u2019t fill the first glass with everything I\u2019ve been beaten by a woman who\u2019s like a crown princess. How can it be this big? There is another chance, so I don\u2019t have to overdo it.By the way, I hope Erinnis will definitely comfort Diana. That way, the purpose of the alliance will not be achieved.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dSitting down for a while and killing time. While I was thinking about going back in at the right time.\u201c\u2026?\u201dI could hear the footsteps of someone walking in the distance. It was not long before he showed up.\u201c\u2026Helios\u2026.\u201dThe main character\u2019s name lingered in my mouth.Helios soon found me, too.\u201cThe greatest of the empire\u2026.\u201d\u201cLady Hestia. Isn\u2019t Diana\u2019s tea party going on right now?\u201dA man who suddenly brings out his business even before I could say hello with all manners. There is nothing to be rough about who is not the heroine.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBut why are you here?\u201dSharp golden eyes poked.\u201cI was being rude to the crown princess, so I stepped back for a moment to cool my head.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean rude?\u201dWhen will the barrage of questions end? A sigh came out.\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, so you\u2019d better hear it from the holy princess later. But wasn\u2019t the crown prince on his way to cheer for her holiness\u2019s party?\u201dHelios raised the tip of one lip at an angle.\u201cYou said you were rude to Diana a while ago, but are you going to be arrogant to me now? You\u2019re always fearless.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dMaybe it\u2019s better to just shut up.Whatever I thought to myself, Helios pointed to the entrance of the party with a chin.\u201cLet\u2019s go in together, Hestia.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWhy me?An instinctive question almost popped out. Helios\u2019 handsome eyebrows frowned furiously.\u201cIs it your hobby to spit on orders from your immediate supervisor?\u201d\u201c\u2026No. I see.\u201dThis is the end of the break.Unfortunately, I got up after taking my seat. Then, without looking back, I followed the Helios, who strode, and entered the banquet hall again.\u201cGreetings to the great empire\u2019s little sun.\u201dAs soon as Helios entered, the nobles in the hall stood up at once and greeted. I stood still behind him and lowered my gaze.\u201cEveryone, sit down.\u201dHe nodded his head and simply replied. Then he strode towards Diana at once.\u201cDiana.\u201d\u201cHeli, you\u2019re here.\u201dTwo who affectionately kiss.I had no choice but to stagger back to my seat and sit down. Countess Erinnis leaned over and whispered.\u201cIt\u2019s great here.\u201dIt was short, but enough to convey the meaning.Helios settled next to Diana.\u201cIs everyone enjoying the party?\u201d\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. Everyone was talking in a friendly way, your highness the crown prince.\u201dErinnis, who again straightened her posture, answered skillfully.Helios had a ceremonial smile on his face.\u201cTreating the crown princess is like treating me. I hope that your respect will go for my wife without fail.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness,\u201dThey bowed and answered politely.No wonder I have a guilty conscience. I\u2019ve already made a big mess of Helios before he showed up.If there was someone who looked at me kindly at a time like this, I would have immediately told him what happened a while ago, but the banquet hall was calm as if nothing had happened.Helios held up his teacup and began to talk softly to Diana. Starting with this, the tea time, which had been cut off for a while, continued again with a loud voice.It was only then that I could talk to other ladies around me.\u201cLady Hestia. You don\u2019t look like it because you\u2019re young, but you\u2019re more thoughtful than I expected.\u201d\u201cOh, me?\u201dI asked back with an air of embarrassment.\u201cIt was an opportunity to reflect on Marquis Kaelus. Lady Marquis\u2019 words were very impressive.\u201d\u201cSo did I. Now that I see you, you\u2019re a very eloquent speaker.\u201dMy face flushed slightly with the compliment I had been given.\u201cDon\u2019t mention it\u2026. I\u2019m rather embarrassed. I\u2019ve done something presumptuous in front of all the high-profile people.\u201dI bowed my head with some humility.Then someone finally recognized my dress.\u201cBy the way, what kind of designer is the dress that the marchioness is wearing? It\u2019s pretty beautiful.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m very embarrassed in front of you, but fortunately, I was introduced to a good tailor whose name was unknown.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dEven if you don\u2019t say it\u2019s a dress that\u2019s been reformed, those who have good eyes may have already noticed. I\u2019d rather save my words here and look much more dignified.Countess Erinnis smiled covering her lips.\u201cThe marchioness is a very considerate person. I wonder why we didn\u2019t know about this person.\u201d\u201cWhoa, I\u2019m flattered.\u201dI had a chat with the ladies.Friendly public opinion at the party was generally inclined to me. Although I had a war of words with the Crown Princess, my presence was recognized quite favorably by the nobles. Even though I was a commoner, my confrontation with Diana on behalf of the aristocrats may have been the reason for my score.Then.\u201cHestia.\u201dI heard a very businesslike voice. It was Helios.\u201cYes, your highness,\u201dHe asked the guests at the table for their understanding.\u201cI need to talk to my aide about something, so I have to take her for a while. Ladies and gentlemen.\u201dI glanced at Diana. She was lifting the cup as if to avoid my gaze.You\u2019ve been talking about me. It\u2019s fast, too.When I reached a quiet place, Helios swung at me.\u201cYou\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI shut my mouth with no expression. I don\u2019t want to bother Helios on purpose, and I don\u2019t want to just answer.You say. I\u2019m going to let it out in one ear.\u201cI\u2019ll listen to Diana slowly later, as you said just earlier, exactly what you said. But I want to know right away why.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the spouse\u2019s duty to restore the honor of her fallen husband? So that\u2019s what happened.\u201dHe snorted at the mechanical reply.\u201cDo you think I\u2019ll hear that excuse straight away?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThink of it as an excuse or not.Helios pressed down on his forehead.\u201cTell me what you don\u2019t like, Hestia.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not like that.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ve been determined to fight Diana since the beginning?\u201d\u201cFight? How dare I fight with her highness? I really just wanted to correct the public view of Kaelus.\u201dI have no intention of telling my real purpose honestly in front of the fox Helios. Even if it\u2019s obvious that you don\u2019t like the two main characters, you shouldn\u2019t be caught having revenge on them.\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios stared me in the face. That doesn\u2019t mean you can see right through me.A laugh leaked out.\u201cThe reason why I committed profanity to her highness is exactly the same as why you are asking me this much. Please don\u2019t get me wrong.\u201dThen this time he burst out laughing in vain.\u201cYour reason and my reason are the same? So what, do you love him?\u201d\u201cOh, of course. That\u2019s a given.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dI really told the truth, but the man in front of me didn\u2019t seem to believe at all.Anyway, the reason why Helios is pushing me like this is because I said something bad to Diana after all. Why do you have to drag it out?\u201cIf her highness feels uncomfortable, I will visit you separately and apologize. I didn\u2019t do it out of malice.\u201dHe stared at me for a long time and then spat out.\u201c\u2026Keep that promise.\u201dHelios turned away from me.Anyway, since the two of them were together, I asked about the emperor\u2019s situation.\u201cBy the way, is it okay for the holy princess to leave the emperor alone for so long? I\u2019ve predicted it, but I don\u2019t know exactly when it\u2019s going to happen, so I\u2019m nervous.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve asked. in the event of the accident that you foretold, so that she can take immediate action.\u201dHelios replied with a sigh. He must have been nervous, to be honest.\u201cPlease go back, your Highness, the crown princess will be waiting.\u201d\u201cYes, you should\u2026\u201dHe retorted, looking away.The crown prince stayed with Diana for a short time and left the party.\u201cI think I\u2019d better disappear because the main character of this meeting is my companion.\u201dHelios greeted Diana with a light kiss, as he had come, and returned.Still, he is sensible. It\u2019s Diana\u2019s tea party, which means he knows what the society will say later.I had been called separately by the crown prince, so I needed to deliberately show self-esteem. When I deliberately refrained from speaking to people, Countess Erinnis noticed my meaning and spoke to Diana eagerly.\u201cYour Highness is very much loved. I\u2019m very jealous.\u201d\u201cHeli is a bit worried. Whoo\u2026.\u201dDiana smiled brightly and mingled with Erinnis.This completes the painting we hoped for perfectly. Erinnis, who embraced the depressed crown princess. The birth of a new friend that Diana could rely on.I smiled secretly. Today\u2019s tea party was a success.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDiana\u2019s tea party left a lot to be talked about. Especially Diana\u2019s amazing self-assertion.\u201cShe didn\u2019t have such a strict image in the original, but oh my gosh\u2026\u201dIn fact, Diana\u2019s cider move itself made no sense in reality.Let\u2019s weigh it in depth. How many common rofan novels ignore even the probability of the main character\u2019s cider?No matter how absolutely buffed Diana is, she\u2019s a commoner, and yet she scolded the nobles without fear and gives infinite support to it!The definition of the main character that no one can argue about. A narrative that gives a rationale for ignoring a reasonable amount of context. In reality, actions that can be judged differently are also supported as unconditionally correct in the novel. If the writer\u2019s writing is good, even the reader will automatically be convinced of its tremendous reality.\u201cBut that\u2019s the charm of rofan..\u201dFantasy is the way to read it.A cool flip of the weak against the strong, not possible in reality. Except for the element of vitalicious satisfaction, what fun would it be to read a novel? I was also a big fan of the original novel.Anyway, it\u2019s limited to fiction. There will no longer be a consistent cider road in front of Diana.\u201cI just need to be happy with our Kaelus.\u201dMy own story with my favorite as the main character. This is the charm of secondary creativity.\u201cLady Hestia, Lord Kaelus is looking for you.\u201d\u201cOh, alright!\u201dAt the words of the butler Uross, I quickly closed my fanatic notebook and woke up*. I was meticulously organizing the timetable for what would happen after the tea party.*TN: from her thoughtsKaelus was waiting in his study.\u201cDid you call me?\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dHe poured out the tea first, now as if it were natural.\u201cI called because I wanted to hear about your tea party. I didn\u2019t think you\u2019d tell me first if I didn\u2019t ask.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dMy favorite with a white face. I like it because it\u2019s expressionless but rather unintentional.After taking a deep breath, Islowly opened my mouth.\u201cI did something a little bold. I had a war of words with Her Highness Diana.\u201dKael\u2019s brow twisted for a moment. I continued with a slight look.\u201cBut I couldn\u2019t help but say something. You just happened to be the talk of the town, and I didn\u2019t like the uncomfortable atmosphere.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThere was no answer. I just took it as a sign to continue.\u201cAnd this is my opinion, but there will be growing discontent among the nobles with Her Highness Diana. It was very simple to fix them. Her highness even made it clear that it was intentional.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure the nobles think they\u2019ve been ignored. If this public opinion hardens over time, it will be difficult for the crown princess to get their help when she needs it.\u201dThe common aristocrat, not the villain in the rofan novel, is just an accessory or the main characters, but in reality, is a great force that must be cooperated.\u201cThen the temple is about to rise.\u201d Kaelus said, smoothed his chin.\u201cYeah, and that\u2019s what aristocrats hate the most.\u201dI excluded emotions as much as possible and concluded it with a businesslike tone. I was so nervous that even a sign of joy might leak out.In fact, the gains of the temple were already well recorded in my fanatic notes. It was the result of Diana\u2019s foolishness, which only made Helios more politically difficult.\u201cWhat about your prophecy?\u201dKaelus\u2019 voice naturally smiled. I couldn\u2019t help looking stupid. I feel like I\u2019m being healed just by his voice.\u201cThat will put the crown prince in trouble. Regardless of Helios\u2019 wishes, Diana will continue to support the temple.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dBut during the conversation, Clarice, the lady-in-waiting, came and said.\u201cA letter has arrived for your wife. It was sent from the salon.\u201dIf it\u2019s the salon, it\u2019s Madame Harmonia.\u201cBring it here.\u201dI opened the letter of Harmonia in front of Kaelus. After reading the contents quickly, I handed it to Kaelus.\u201cThe time has come. Because of what I said at the tea party, the temple publicly criticized me. They say I\u2019m a person who ignores humanity because she is blinded by the benefits of results.\u201d\u201c!\u201dKaelus\u2019 eyes were icy cold.LOL, the laughter spread. I\u2019d rather be thankful if you shot at me like this. I guess it\u2019s still funny to the extent that the land document was taken away. You\u2019re sticking your neck out for me.\u201cBut there\u2019s nothing to worry about. Kaelus, it\u2019s something that can be solved soon enough.\u201dKaelus looked at me stiffly.Suddenly, I was worried that he would come forward on his own. At home, it was still quite stable, but I was still anxious to do outside activities. It was still due to occasional seizures such as shortness of breath. It was dangerously impossible to rush out in public until he was fully recovered.But that doesn\u2019t mean his help is absolutely unnecessary.\u201cKaelus, I have a favor to ask of you. Bring the soap makers together.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe sharp purple eyes opened blankly for a moment. Even this dramatic change in his eyes is so pretty. I am in awe for a moment.\u201cIt\u2019s just as I asked. Please bring together the soap craftsmen and set up a place to mass-produce them.\u201dIn order to get Diana on her knees, I had to break the temple first. I\u2019ve only been looking for opportunities since the moment I decided to save Kaelus, but the game is so natural. I was rather happy.The first step of a journey to weaken the temple\u2019s power. Making sure people don\u2019t have to look for the temple.Where does the power of the temple come from? It comes directly from those who seek the temple. Then why do people look for the temple? That\u2019s because you can cure the disease only when you go to the temple. Recall that the healing saint Diana belonged to the temple.What does a doctor do to get treatment in a temple? In order to tackle that, we must first look at the novel\u2019s world.In this world, the cause of the disease is found in God\u2019s anger or individual sins. Just like the West in the Middle Ages.Therefore, in order to cure the disease, first confess your sins to God and repent. After that, the retainers prescribe various medicines and treat wounds of sick people.Of course there are doctors. However, it is a little different from what we usually think. Real doctors usually live as doctors of royalty or aristocrats, and are not easily met by commoners.In any case, if ordinary people can treat the disease without going to the temple, and furthermore, if they do not get caught easily at all, the value of the temple\u2019s existence will be halved.Then, what is the most important factor to avoid getting sick? Isn\u2019t it personal hygiene after all?Kaelus did not hide his surprise when he heard me asking him to build a soap \u2018factory\u2019.\u201cWhat does mass production of soap have to do with restoring your honor?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have to recover my honor. What I want is the fall of the temple.\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe purple eyes grew as big as they could.I began to explain step by step for him.\u201cThe widespread use of soap can definitely reduce the incidence of disease. That way, if people don\u2019t have to go to the temple, the power of the temple will naturally weaken.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201d\u201cIn fact, the reason why soap has become exclusive to the aristocratic class is because it is too expensive for ordinary people. Instead of giving up delicate pieces without adding scents, making them all in a rough shape will greatly reduce production costs.\u201dAnd the hardest part. I continued, keeping an eye on Kaelus.\u201cIf this is still expensive, we have to produce and distribute as much as possible at the Marquis\u2019 expense. At least in Illion.\u201dKaelus looked at me with a blank face.\u201cIs that really all you want?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s the most important thing. Kaelus, please.\u201dThe beautiful purple gaze did not fall from me for a long time.\u201c\u2026Okay. I\u2019ll do that.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dI answered quickly with a big smile. Then his lips slowly opened again.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome\u2026 \u2026Hess.\u201dI came back to the room in a daze. Kaelus\u2019 voice still rang in my ears. Hess. Hess. Hess\u2026\u201cOh my God\u2026.\u201dWow! My heart is about to explode! What do I do?\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dI put my hand on my chest and took a deep breath several times. My heart was still pounding.To be honest, I didn\u2019t think pet names were a big deal. From the point of view of the reader of rofan, I once thought that the writer was lazy to type the long names of the characters one by one; so they shortened it.But!\u201cWow\u2026 this is really, I\u2019m going to melt\u2026.\u201dCome on, I have to write back to Madame Harmonia, which is a big deal. Am I in a situation to write a letter or something? If Kael calls me Hess one more time, I think I\u2019ll just faint on the spot. It\u2019s making me crazy.Inside, I rolled around on the bed, repeating \u201cWow, Wow\u201d indefinitely. If this excitement doesn\u2019t calm down, how can I sit at that desk!Really, Kaelus. I\u2019ll grind my whole body to make you happy.I live here because of you, and there\u2019s no reason to live here unless it\u2019s you. I mean it.I\u2019ll make all the people who bothered you come to you and kneel down.I\u2019ll fill that hole in your heart.\u201cPhew\u2026 To do that, I must write a letter to Harmonia as soon as soon as possible..?\u201dYou can achieve your ultimate goal by dealing with the tasks in front of you.I stopped stomping my feet and went over to sit at the desk. I have to write back to the letter I read with Kaelus earlier.\u201cThank you very much for your prompt reply\u2026. But right now\u2026 I want to respond to the accusations of the temple\u2026 It\u2019s not\u2026.\u201dYes, I can\u2019t afford to waste my energy on things like words that waste my thoughts. A dirty verbal fight is just tiring, and it is important to pay back with more definite actions.Once Kaelus has said he will gather soap craftsmen, there is a little room until my work is done.\u201cI\u2019ll make the temple warehouse full*. Hmph.\u201d*TN: translation was empty but full makes more sense if she\u2019s taking away their visitorsI\u2019ll step on you to the point where you crumple like the tip of this finely chewed pen. We\u2019re not the same, gentleman.Anyway, I made a promise to Helios, so I headed to the palace. On the way to apologize for the fight to Diana.I was hoping she\u2019d be so intimidated by me that she\u2019d avoid asking for an audience. It seems that she hasn\u2019t felt that much defeat yet.Diana\u2019s reply in hand was quite simple. Come to the lily palace.I don\u2019t intend to spend much time with her. I\u2019ll just say, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry about that day.\u201d I\u2019m just trying to save face because I told Helios that, but honestly, I\u2019m not really sorry.\u201cHestia, wife of the Illion lord. I\u2019m here to see the crown princess.\u201dWhen I told the lily\u2019s servant, he quickly went inside. And after a while I followed him to Diana\u2019s drawing room.As I sat waiting, Diana appeared with two or three maids behind her.I lowered my posture neatly.\u201cGreetings to the little moon of the noble empire.\u201d\u201c\u2026 get up, marchioness.\u201dA reluctant tone. I guess she\u2019s pretty uncomfortable.\u201cI heard from Heli that you wanted to apologize to me. I really didn\u2019t expect you to come.\u201dOh no. When Diana is upset, she\u2019s really upset.\u201cOh, your highness. I\u2019m not shameless enough to stretch out and sleep after such a thick act. I\u2019m just sorry to find out that you\u2019re very disappointed in me.\u201dI don\u2019t care whether I\u2019m alone or not, but I think it\u2019ll be convenient to soothe it appropriately for later.\u201cI will go to the temple soon and repent and reflect on my sins. Your highness\u2019s words make sense to the principle.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay. Let\u2019s believe it.\u201dI guess she was a little relieved because I roughly said what she said was right. The stiff expression softened a little.I\u2019m done with my business now. But if I leave my seat quickly, my thoughts will be too transparent, right? I tried to have a conversation to match the image with a mindless mind.\u201cBut how is his majesty\u2019s condition? I can\u2019t sleep because my heart is heavy because I gave you a negative prediction\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dDiana sighed softly.\u201cIt\u2019s a top secret, but you\u2019ve foreseen it, so it\u2019s right to let you know. Anyway, Heli said it\u2019d be better to tell you.\u201dOh, I guess the emperor finally fell down.\u201cDid the accident happen?\u201d\u201cYes, it would have been a real disaster if it weren\u2019t for your wisdom. Last night, while his majesty was drinking, he suddenly felt dizzy and collapsed. Because I was right there, I was able to use healing power immediately.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so glad. I want to thank you even more.\u201dSuddenly, I wanted to confirm one thing here.To what extent did Diana\u2019s healing power restore the emperor? If the flow before the return was the same, her great ability would be slowly weakening.In fact, Diana herself knows better than anyone else. That her power isn\u2019t what it used to be.There is probably no one in the world who can dare ask this openly. Even Helios will not be able to confirm with suspicion.But I am available. Why? Because I\u2019m a \u201ctalent\u201d like Diana!\u201cBut your highness. I have a question for you.\u201dDiana\u2019s eyes shook uneasily. Why does she always get scared whenever I say something?\u201cDo you have to ask?\u201d\u201cYes. Can we speak alone first?\u201dDiana was on high alert, but was gentle enough to dismiss the ladies.When I was left alone with her, I finally opened my mouth.\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s because of a prophecy. Before I speak to the crown prince, the holy lady must know\u2026.\u201dDiana\u2019s expression hardened noticeably.\u201cI need to know before he does.\u2026?\u201dAhhhh. I\u2019m always excited about dropping a bomb like this!\u201cYes, your grace. Have you had any problems lately with your power?\u201d\u201c!\u201dAnger or something passed through her eyes. She soon refuted, distorting her face.\u201cMy healing power is completely intact. How can you denigrate the grace of God with such words?\u201dOh, is it still okay?\u201cYour Highness, calm down. I didn\u2019t mean to disparage it. However, I wanted to check it out according to my prophecy, so please don\u2019t be too angry.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean prophecy? What did you see about me?\u201dI could see her holding back his anger. Our kind Diana is very patient, too patient.Let\u2019s break it.\u201cYour highness will soon lose her healing power.\u201d\u201c?!\u201dDiana was completely frozen. My open lips couldn\u2019t close.I tried desperately to harden my face like Diana.\u201cIn the next two years, your power will disappear without a trace. That\u2019s why I tell you this prophecy first. Before Helios knew it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dSeriously and privately, my voice was so low that it was tense as if I were telling a secret that should never be discovered.\u201cYour highness the crown princess, when the world finds out that your highness is no longer a saint\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDiana didn\u2019t respond to the deliberate trailing of words.You should add some seasoning just in case.\u201cI\u2019m one of the people who most want this wisdom to go astray. But I couldn\u2019t deny that my ability was also given by God. All I can do is deliver as I see it. Therefore, there is not a single lie in what I am saying, your highness the saintess.\u201dI\u2019ve been hiding my ability for two years. Do we really need to reveal disadvantages?Diana was speechless for a long time. Then she managed to remove her trembling lips.\u201c\u2026Even if I lose my ability, I\u2019m still the crown princess of this country.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re right!\u201dI deliberately raised my voice in response. At the same time, I didn\u2019t forget to touch her anxiety.\u201cIs it only because of the phenomenal healing power that you became the next empress as a civilian priestess? His majesty would have recognized you as his daughter-in-law, because you had other qualifications, of course!\u201dWhat do you think, Diana? How sure are you about yourself? Can you prove your worth without divine healing?Even if God\u2019s blessing is gone, even if you\u2019re no longer a saint, can you convince people of your faith and morality? Do you think you can continue everything you\u2019ve ever done, even after you\u2019re a normal human being?I smiled brightly.\u201cNow that I see it, I must have been worried for nothing. Your Highness Diana is so strong. Since I have visited the Imperial Palace, I will go back to see the crown prince.\u201dI got up at once from my seat. Then.\u201cOh, wait, wait. Hestia\u2026.\u201dI secretly called for joy, replying in an easy-going tone.\u201cYes, go ahead, your highness the crown princess.\u201d\u201cMaybe you\u2019re seeing Heli right now.. Are you going to tell him about the prophecy?\u201dI nodded my head with a made-up innocent look at her trying to be calm.\u201cOf course I meant to, but is there something bothering you?\u201d\u201cThat\u2026 This prediction\u2026 I want to talk to Heli myself. It\u2019s about my personal life.\u201d\u201cWell, if you say so\u2026\u201dI pretended to be worried for a while, but soon smiled softly.\u201cI see. Your highness will tell him about this yourself. I won\u2019t say anything.\u201d\u201cThank you, Hestia.\u201dI walked towards the outside of the drawing room with some courtesy. Then I stopped suddenly.\u201cWell, by the way, Your Highness,\u201d\u201c?\u201dI stopped going out and called her, and she looked at me nervously, wondering what else was left.I deliberately tried to be vague.\u201c\u2026 if you\u2019re trying to hide\u2026 For as long as possible\u2026.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI didn\u2019t finish my sentence, but I gave her a meaningful look.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWe look at each other in silence.Diana stared at me, unmoving. As if I\u2019m the culprit behind all the conflict.\u201c\u2026.\u201dLeaving her alone, I quietly opened the door and came out.I just gave you a choice.Diana, what are you worried about? So far, your answer has always been fixed.Will I be able to see your consistent cider this time? There\u2019s no hesitation, is there? You\u2019re gonna tell Helios everything, and you\u2019re gonna get through this together, right?\u201cHuhuhuhh\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s very interesting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat evening, after a long time, I ate with Kaelus.\u201cI went to the Imperial Palace today. I saw the crown princess.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dKaelus\u2019s retorted gaze was directed to the plate.When I mention Diana in front of him, he still can\u2019t look me in the eye.But it\u2019s still this big. It\u2019s a great improvement compared to the past when he had difficulty breathing just thinking about Diana.I told him in a calm tone as he continued to eat without expression as usual.\u201cI told Diana. Soon the healing power will be gone.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThen Kaelus looked up at me.In the original novel, he was fascinated by Diana\u2019s upright mind and her straight convictions that did not compromise with injustice. A clean and pure line found for the first time in an extremely selfish group of humans. Diana meant that to Kael.How pure and beautiful Diana is compared to myself, a sly politician. Kaelus loved her and admired her at the same time. Diana was a jewel-bearing* woman he didn\u2019t have.*TN: not literally but it means she has a lot to offerIf I kneel down to her, what kind of expression would he make?\u201cHe said she\u2019d tell the crown prince herself, so I won\u2019t say anything. Her use of power on His majesty yesterday seems to be clear yet.\u201d\u201cOh, did your majesty eventually fall down?\u201d\u201cYes. Fortunately, her highness, who was waiting by his side, healed him immediately.\u201d\u201cI see. I\u2019m so glad.\u201dKaelus nodded a few times. Then suddenly he brought up another topic.\u201cDo you have any urgent business to deal with?\u201d\u201cUrgent? No, I don\u2019t.\u201dIf I take care of this and that, I don\u2019t actually have time to relax. But if asked if they were particularly urgent, it was frankly not.Kaelus\u2019 eyes turned back to the plate.\u201cShall we go out together?\u201d\u201c!\u201dI almost dropped my fork! You want to go out to see the fief? With me? The two of us?\u201cWhy? You don\u2019t like it?\u201d\u201cNo!\u201dIt should be noted in advance that this answer came in response to the peripheral nerves without going through the brain, and that rational judgment was not reflected at all.Kaelus continued the rest, humming, \u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cThanks to your skillful management of the territory\u2019s internal affairs, the chief and other people are very grateful. That\u2019s right. I think it\u2019d be better to show your face once.\u201d\u201cOh, yes!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not too far from here, so I thought we\u2019d leave tomorrow morning. We\u2019ll be home by the evening.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cIs there anything else to talk about?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus\u2019 expression was strangely distorted. No matter what I say, did it seem weird? Yes, yes, repeating myself?No, I\u2019m sure it did. I feel really weird, too.He got up from the table when he had finished his meal moderately.\u201cI\u2019ll go first. See you tomorrow morning.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dMy favorite disappeared, leaving with eyes that seemed to have seen all strange things.\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dI don\u2019t know if the rice goes in the mouth or the nose. Clarice, who was next to me, was seen clenching her teeth not to laugh.\u201c\u2026You can just laugh\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, ma\u2019am. Whoo\u2026\u201dYou said no yet you laughed. Words and actions are different.On my way back to the room, I discussed the retreat.\u201cI\u2019ll have to pack up now to leave in the morning, Clarice.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of what we need. Please sleep tight so that you don\u2019t get tired.\u201dWill I be able to sleep properly? I might die of excitement.\u201cWould you like a tea to help you sleep well?\u201d\u201c\u2026please.\u201dThe next morning, Kaelus sat in the carriage, dressed in a light coat over his comfortable daily clothes.I said hello awkwardly.\u201cHave you slept well?\u201d\u201cThanks to you.\u201dA curt reply. Still, this is Kaelus\u2019s usual self..Shortly after I got on, the carriage began to move slowly. A pleasant wind coming in from the open carriage window.One of the great things about being in the novel is that it is a mild spring day all year round here.I don\u2019t know if the writer made the settings roughly or not, but there was little seasonal change in the world. Instead, there was a geographical difference. In other words, it\u2019s still winter in the north and summer in the south. The capital was in the middle, so it seemed to be spring.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy long black hair was wrapped around my face every time the wind blew. But I didn\u2019t want to close the window, so I had to hold my hair with one hand.\u201c\u2026\u201dOn the other hand, how elegant is my favorite! That long silver hair doesn\u2019t get tangled up in the wind, it\u2019s just pretty and sexy! This dirty world where even the wind is unfair.It was quiet in the carriage. Suddenly, I remembered the scene where the Illion estate appeared in the original.Kaelus, who went out to Ilion with Diana, was very ashamed to meet a begging child on a busy street during a date while looking back at the estate. Diana, who smiled softly and said it was okay, asked the child about their circumstances. They said their mother was sick.Diana was good and boldly healed the child\u2019s mother, who could not be treated for lack of money. The whole of Illion became noisy without the reward of going undercover. for the noble Lady of God had descended upon their native land.When the episode appeared in the series, readers who were pushing Kael for lead went wild. You don\u2019t have to sell this story? Of course, even though the lead was already concluded with Helios from the cover, a fan like me who suffers from a serious second lead syndrome only wished for Kael\u2019s happiness.Among the Ilion episodes, the scene where Diana\u2019s identity was revealed was the strongest. People who ignored poor children apologized and were humiliated, and the people of the camp thanked Lord Kaelus for bringing the saint.It was also an episode that highlighted the agony of Kaelus, who loved the saintess. Along with the desire for her and to clip her wings toward the world under the grace of God. While Helios had a powerful title called the crown prince, the Marquis\u2019 status that Kaelus could give was too small a title for theperfect heroine Diana.Now it will be very special for Kaelus to return to Ilion after being abandoned by Diana.There will be memories and memories of laughing with Diana everywhere, and feelings of shame as a lord in front of the poverty of a Illion citizen.You can come when you\u2019re more stable, but aren\u2019t you pushing yourself too hard? Rebuking himself for not recovering yet.I guess I was staring at Kael without realizing it. His purple eyes moved gently.\u201cAre you worried?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI shrugged my shoulders. I wondered if all my thoughts were revealed on my face.Kaelus smiled faintly.\u201cI\u2019m going to go outside now. I can\u2019t stay inside forever.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to rush into it. It was only three or four months.\u201dIn fact, it is the first time that Kaelus has taken a break for so long. Because he\u2019s been running nonstop since he came of age.Since the conversation began, I asked him how he felt about visiting the territory.\u201cHow do you feel? In the past\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t say that I came with Diana. Still, my favorite managed to catch on to the backstory.Purple eyes glided out of the window again.\u201c\u2026 You know I came with her.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201d\u201cI often think that you\u2019re not looking into the future, but actually looking at the past better.\u201dHis words made my heart ache. Even though he has become mentally weak after suicide attempts, his insight is still sharp.As soon as Diana became the talk of the town, the air immediately became heavy. Kaelus closed his mouth tightly with a dark complexion.Oh, my. Was I being too rash? I should change the subject quickly.\u201cI might have a lot of territory soon.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201dFortunately, Kaelus showed interest in what I said. Whew. I succeeded in turning the mood around.\u201cYes, I asked Helios for a reward when I decided to give him a foresight. I said I wanted the Attica land.\u201d\u201cAttica? You mean the duke\u2019s estate?\u201dKaelus\u2019 voice grew rare. You look very surprised.\u201cYes\u2026\u201dSpeaking of which, I think I chose the wrong topic. I signed the marriage contract saying I was not interested in the Marquis\u2019 property, but it became like I was greedy for territory from Helios.To be honest, I wasn\u2019t really greedy about the land, but I was conditioned to make my own mark about my position as a villainess instead of Letona. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m the only one who knows anyway, and everyone else would think I\u2019m materialistic.Including my favorite.\u201c\u2026\u201dI suddenly feel depressed. I feel somewhat shabby.I added weakly.\u201cAnd to you, the duke title\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dUnbelievable. Unbelievable. That\u2019s exactly the look on Kaelus\u2019 face.\u201cEr, if you don\u2019t like it, you can say no\u2026.\u201d\u201cLike Princess Letona, is it?\u201d\u201c!\u201dHe hit the nail on the head.His cold purple eyes turned straight at me.\u201cI guess I\u2019m right. You want to be Letona, don\u2019t you?\u201dPrincess Letona, who confronted Diana and Helios and was urged to die by Kaelus.I am right to be like Princess Letona, as Kaelus said. On the one hand, however, it is not. I just want to look like her from Diana\u2019s and Helios\u2019 point of view, not for Kaelus.\u201c\u2026.\u201dPurple eyes like glass eyes staring at me.I\u2019m afraid to face it.Somehow a cold sounding voice rang in the carriage.\u201cHestia, are you related to Letona?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dAh, they might misunderstand like this way. Then I\u2019ll have to clarify.\u201cThe dead princess has nothing to do with me. But I\u2019ll have to admit that my move is similar to hers.\u201dHow he took my words, Kaelus kept looking at me without any response.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWell, if you\u2019ve looked at me this much, I wish you\u2019d stop looking at me.Gradually, my face heated up. I don\u2019t know where to put my eyes because that pretty face of my favorite keeps on falling off.When one\u2019s eyes wander aimlessly..\u201c\u2026Come to think of it, I don\u2019t know anything about you.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dWhy does my heart tickle with that indifferent way of speaking? Although Kaelus only recited objective facts.\u201cIf you have any questions for me, you can ask me. I\u2019ll answer everything I can.\u201dI smiled as gently as I could, with my sincere heart that it was really okay.Kaelus looked at me for a long time with a mysterious face. And in the end.\u201c\u2026Next time.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dOh, I\u2019m losing my energy. I really could have told you everything if Kaelus asked me anything.But on the other hand, I was relieved. I wondered if he might ask a question that was unanswerable. For example, philosophical consideration of foresight.What he might be curious about me is not about my personal identity. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s about my ability. I\u2019ve been digging into this problem quite deeply in theory before.So if Kaelus wants to know about me, why not just show it before his eyes? It\u2019s not like he\u2019s out of sight.Oh, there\u2019s one problem. Let\u2019s exclude silly comments that pop up.Ilion was a rich estate. It was close to the imperial city and had a large river, so commerce is very developed. If the Duke of Orcus\u2019 estate Attica was famous for its vast size, the Marquis\u2019s estate Ilion was well known for its bustling vitality.Our carriage headed straight to the residence where the lord stays. The eyes of the crowd on the street did not fall from the carriage.Perhaps because of the experience of the true reader who binge-read the original novel nine times, Diana\u2019s appreciation of the Ilion landscape suddenly came to mind.\u201cThe energy of the people who live to the fullest\u2026.\u201dI murmured casually, and for a moment I was dumbfounded. I turned my head in a hurry, and as expected.\u201c\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe purple eyes that are nailed to me, wide open as if in wonder.I glossed over with an awkward smile.\u201cHa ha ha\u2026 Prophecy just leaked out\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not foresight. That\u2019s exactly what someone said in the past.\u201dKaelus said flatly.A half-baked excuse is unlikely to work. I had to nod my head.\u201cYes, as you say, I didn\u2019t see the future. That\u2019s what Diana said when she came here with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe held his breath still. I laughed bitterly, too.\u201cI know everything. So you don\u2019t have to force yourself to act like you don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201c\u2026is that so?\u201dThe purple gaze finally drew back from me and headed straight out the window.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI sighed so quietly that he couldn\u2019t hear me.Today, can I finish the day without making a mistake?I arrived at the lord\u2019s residence. Kaelus opened the door first and got off.\u201cLord\u2026!\u201dAs Kaelus was known to the public to be ill, the chief and junior officials of Ilion seemed to be greatly relieved when he appeared to be in good health on the outside.Kaelus said with that cold look on his face.\u201cYou said you wanted to see my wife.\u201dUgh. He said wife\u2026\u2026! I\u2019m his wife!In fact, even if you are a fake wife who is married only on paper, you must act as a marquis wife thoroughly from the outside. And that\u2019s what\u2019s very, very important to me!\u201cIt\u2019s my first time saying hello. My name is Hestia.\u201dNot arrogant, but not easy. Moderately polite, moderately distant. Greetings to subordinates require very delicate skills.Officials below the chief have also greeted politely.\u201cThanks to Lady Hestia\u2019s attention to the internal affairs, urgent issues could be dealt with in time. I can\u2019t help but thank you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I just did my job as the wife of the lord. It\u2019s natural to help him concentrate on his recovery.\u201dIt may sound a little harsh to the listeners. But I wanted to insinuate to Kaelus that my interest is not in this estate.Whether he knows what I mean, Kaelus said with a casual look.\u201cI\u2019ll take a short break and go on an inspection tour.\u201d\u201cOh, would you? All right. Then let\u2019s go inside first, my lord.\u201dThe chief replied with a friendly answer.Soon we followed him into the mansion.As if prepared from the morning, brunch was well prepared on the table in the drawing room. And of course, the tea set.\u201c\u2026\u201dCoffee is the best in the morning. Bitter coffee Iced Americano. ah ah.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dNext to him, Kaelus tilted his head slightly and opened his mouth.\u201cIs there no coffee?\u201d\u201cOh, should I make coffee?\u201dThe lord asked back with a grim look. Like blaming himself for the mistake that he didn\u2019t get the taste of the owner.In the meantime, I stood stiff and unable to breathe. No way. Because of me, Kaelus\u2026?!\u201cMy wife usually goes for coffee in the morning. You\u2019d better keep that in mind from now on.\u201d\u201cOh, I see! I\u2019m sorry, my lord!\u201dThe mission deacon quickly disappeared. Next to him, I almost disappeared without a sound.Did you hear that? Kaelus, he knows my taste! What a great honor for a fan!\u201cHow did you know?\u201dWhen I asked, the answer that came back in a sulky manner was even greater.\u201cDid you think I wouldn\u2019t know what the salon\u2019s madam knew?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ve never said\u2026.\u201d\u201cWe live under one roof, and of course I should know.\u201dI\u2019m getting hit. A cool, indifferent way of speaking as if it were nothingAfter a while, the butler of the lord returned with a coffee kettle. The white teacup was filled with steaming hot coffee. It\u2019s not my favorite iced Americano, but I still don\u2019t know where it could be. Don\u2019t expect too much from the rofan world.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I should have prepared more carefully\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s okay. Not many aristocrats enjoy coffee. I understand.\u201dIn fact, technically the butler wasn\u2019t terribly wrong. In general, it\u2019s not common to serve coffee when serving aristocrats. The aristocracy here in the world tends to enjoy tea more, and coffee is usually treated as a cheaper favorite.If I were a barista in this world, I would have opened a cafe with my flamboyant skills. In this world where coffee is not very developed, it is a pity.While he was thinking about something else for a moment, Kaelus was listening to a rough report from the chief.\u201cI need to check the embankment first. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been paid properly.\u201d\u201cYes, thanks to your prompt approval of the budget, I was able to repair it in time.\u201d\u201cDid you bring the construction log and accounting report?\u201d\u201cHere it is, my lord.\u201dKaelus glanced dryly through the document. And then he was handing them over to me!\u201cYou know better because you took care of it.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dI\u2019m sure you\u2019re right, but I feel like I\u2019m passing it on strangely.Anyway, I quickly checked the documents prepared by the chief. As a result of roughly calculating the total budget and the detailed amount, the calculation itself was fine.Well, what kind of full would have written a false report? His boss is Marquis Kaelus, who takes orders from the emperor himself.\u201cThe numbers are clear. There are no unnecessary items at first glance.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dKaelus nodded indifferently.After a brief meal, we headed for the embankment built by the river under the guidance of the lord.\u201cLast year\u2019s floods were incredible. But compared to other regions, there was little damage.\u201dThe chief said, recalling the time. Due to the nature of Ilion, which has a large population and a large number of stores, the damage would have been unimaginable if the embankment had collapsed.However, the author of the original novel handed over the land so easily that they did not have to recover from the flood. So that Diana and Helios can grow their love in a faraway land.Should I thank the writer for this?The lord\u2019s words followed then.\u201cIt\u2019s all thanks to God taking care of us.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know.\u201dWell, let\u2019s say it\u2019s not exactly wrong. The writer is the creator of this world.I took a quick look at the condition of Kaelus as I walked.No wonder, Kaelus was everywhere with Diana in every corner of Ilion. There must be memories of walking alone with Diana on this road to the embankment.How hard is Kaelus fighting his old memories alone now?I told him that I knew everything and that it was okay, but will that alone give him strength?I hope Diana comes to Kaelus as soon as possible and kneels desperately. I want her to apologize desperately for hurting him.Therefore, I must work harder.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe stiffened face of Kaelus.It was fortunate that he was accompanied by his doctor, taking advantage of the fact that he was reportedly ill. I winked at the doctor. The doctor noticed.\u201cWell, marquis. Let\u2019s take a break. You don\u2019t look well.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus looked at the doctor\u2019s face once and then at my face, and nodded silently.A short distance away, the doctor sat him down and made him drink the medicine he had brought. Meanwhile, the chief asked me carefully.\u201cHis health seems to be worse than it looks.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s why I\u2019m trying not to overdo it today.\u201dThen he suddenly lowered his voice.\u201cBy any chance\u2026 \u2026the lord\u2019s illness\u2026 Is it related to her highness the crown princess\u2026?\u201dMy mouth felt bitter. The news was as fast as the capital for a large estate of Ilion. It\u2019s no use denying it.\u201cTo a certain extent. I hope you don\u2019t mention that name in front of my husband as much as you can because he\u2019s been heartbroken.\u201d\u201cOf course, my lady.\u201dWhen the question was resolved, the lord immediately backed down. He is a quick-witted person.Then the doctor looked at me. It meant that it was okay to move again.I approached Kaelus.\u201cKaelus, shall we rest a little longer?\u201dHe couldn\u2019t answer quickly. A white face and expression still stiff.But after a short pause, he stood up fairly resolutely.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s okay.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201dToo much self-preservation can give a negative impression. It\u2019s in front of the lord and the estate officials watching.Still, somehow anxious, I reached out to him reflexively.And to my surprise.\u201c\u2026!\u201dKaelus grabbed me by the arm and raised himself.My first physical contact with my favorite.A moment I\u2019ll never forget.No, technically speaking, this is not the first time I\u2019ve had physical contact with him. When he was about to put a knife in his chest, I struck his hand and made him drop it.But how is it the same as this!\u201c\u2026\u201dI desperately bit my lips so that an internal scream wouldn\u2019t leak out of my mouth.Unfortunately, Kaelus let go of my arm as soon as he stood up completely.Don\u2019t tell me that all the heartbeat sounds were revealed in that short period of time, right? If I turn my head and look at Kaelus now, I think I will be able to see all of my restless mental state. I can\u2019t stand it.Oh, doctor.I wish you\u2019d give me that medicine earlier.The renovated embankment looked very strong to the eye.\u201cIt looks solid.\u201dInstead of Kaelus, who couldn\u2019t speak to control his seizures, I came forward and gave my thoughts to the lord.The lord also nodded.\u201cThe budget approved by the lord\u2019s wife was anything but small. Thanks to it, I\u2019ve been able to fix it well enough for a few years.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not enough. Check carefully every year. There\u2019s no way we shouldn\u2019t have another water crisis like last year.\u201d\u201cYes, I see, my lady.\u201dThere was a path up the embankment for people to walk by. It would be nice to take a walk since we came to the cool riverside after a long time.I asked with a little courage.\u201cKaelus, shall we get some fresh air?\u201d\u201cShould we?\u201dHe complied with my request. I was truly grateful for him not making me embarrassed.People gazed at us and distanced themselves from us. Thanks to this, I was honored to walk alone with my favorite.I spoke in a low voice.\u201cHow\u2019s your breathing?\u201dKaelus replied with a rather pale complexion.\u201cBetter than before.\u201d\u201cPhew, that\u2019s a relief. I\u2019m glad I brought your medicine.\u201dAt the end of this conversation, we just walked on the bank road without a word for a while.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI didn\u2019t bother to break the silence.Neither Kaelus nor I needed time to quietly let the thoughts flow. You don\u2019t have to pretend to be okay or determined by being conscious of the people around you.His pace was very slow. Maybe he\u2019s got a lot of old memories in his head. In addition, his heart must be beating with all kinds of emotions.Wait till he opens his mouth again.Walk with him at his walking pace.My life as Hestia only revolves around Kaelus. That\u2019s the life I really want. The only reason I jumped between the main characters from the position of the extras that I\u2019ve been sticking to.Is my choice funny? Is it trivial? Does it feel like I\u2019m wasting my time on something that won\u2019t even return?But my answer will not falter at all. I will never regret giving this whole life to Kaelus. Rather, I was so happy that I could cry.Do you know when life is most fleeting? That\u2019s when you don\u2019t know what to live for.The purpose of my continuing life as Hestia, the goal of this life, is as clear as day.Kaelus.I\u2019d rather dance and cheer for the vivid orientation in front of me that tells me why to live.\u201cThank you.\u201dMy body hardened for a moment in my mind that popped out again.Then Kaelus turned to me.\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201c\u2026just for being there.\u201dIn the end, I gave up making excuses and confessed honestly.I heard a little silly laugh.\u201cI don\u2019t understand.\u201d\u201cWhoa, I know. I\u2019m not very good at explaining.\u201dIn front of Kaelus, my tongue, which used to work so well, gets stiff.Still, even a false smile was a laugh, and Kaelus\u2019 expression, which had been stiff all along, was a little relieved.It was a load off my mind. I think I can talk about bold things now.\u201cThoughts of the old days\u2026 You have a lot, right?\u201dI carefully treaded. Kaelus\u2019 purple eyes glanced at me and then headed forward again.\u201cWell.\u201dAn equivocal answer. But in my ears it sounded positive enough.I laughed a little.\u201cDiana was a very clear person. For us, the world is so complicated because it\u2019s intertwined, but for her, it\u2019s just so clear.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSometimes that\u2019s comforting. Maybe we\u2019re looking at the world too hard. In fact, it\u2019s okay to live quite simply.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201dKaelus sighed largely.\u201cI could have lived a simpler life.\u201dDeep remorse and heartbreak was in his voice.Isn\u2019t Kaelus living more fiercely than anyone else? Nevertheless, the person he wanted to be recognized the most and loved by so simply judged him.Even if the view of life was simple and clear, it should only be applied to one\u2019s own life, and it should not be applied to other people\u2019s lives.So I hate Diana.I gave him a light answer.\u201cYou can live like that from now on.\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s too much work to do.\u201d\u201cYou can give me some.\u201d\u201cYeah. Is that so?\u201dIt was unexpected. I couldn\u2019t believe he didn\u2019t refuse.I laughed deliberately.\u201cLooking at my room, I guess you like my work skills.\u201dKaelus smiled faintly, too.\u201cHonestly, yes.\u201d\u201cHa, I\u2019m so happy to satisfy you.\u201dIt was a light response that I didn\u2019t want to burden him. I hope Kaelus knows my wish.\u201c\u2026\u201dBeautiful silver hair fluttered in the wind.And\u2026\u201cDiana is\u2026\u201dThe name that finally came out of his mouth. A tough word that overcame a deep wound.I waited quietly for the next horse.\u201c\u2026was so bright that I didn\u2019t dare to embrace\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMy heart was choked up. That\u2019s how Kaelus felt. I didn\u2019t know you were like this, Diana, you don\u2019t even know this.He murmured as if to himself.\u201cShe was a very nice woman. She\u2019s always been strong\u2026 Lightened up your surroundings\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI still didn\u2019t answer back. I was never going to cut it off or cut in until all the words in Kaelus\u2019s heart came out.Kaelus suddenly looked back at me.\u201cI wonder if this is offensive to you.\u201d\u201cNo, not at all.\u201dI answered promptly without hesitation. Did you misunderstand why I wasn\u2019t saying anything?\u201cI told you before. Thanks to Diana, you have a valuable experience of love. It\u2019s a precious time for you, so why would I find it offensive?\u201dJust because I hate Diana doesn\u2019t mean that Kaelus should hate her.Rather, I hope that the memory of Diana will remain a peaceful and beautiful memory for him. May it remain a good feeling, not a deep wound that will bleed.Purple eyes slightly deflected me.\u201c\u2026thank you, Hess.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dWhat makes me cry like this.It\u2019s only Kaelus.After taking a walk on the embankment, I moved to downtown. Like the imperial city, Ilion was a rich land with developed commerce.Suddenly, I was curious about my father\u2019s estate on my documents, which I had never been to. A remote mountain village. How small is it compared to this place?Now I have long since changed my introduction to the wife of the Illion lord, instead of the daughter of the Elea lord. Just as I threw away the past of living as an extra in the novel, I no longer attract poor outskirts of Elea in my introduction.In just a few months, my life as an icebreaker has changed so much.The lord\u2019s voice broke off one way or another.\u201cIn recent trade, luxury goods are more important than food. I think it\u2019s proof that we\u2019re getting out of the aftermath of last year\u2019s flood.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKaelus frowned slightly.I guessed why he was so unhappy. I said to the lord, shaking my head.\u201cThe increased consumption of luxury goods means that wealth has become more biased. I don\u2019t think the situation of the poor in the compound will be much different from the time of the flood.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dThe lord\u2019s face turned pale. I didn\u2019t miss an opportunity and gave a sharp look.\u201cHer highness, who visited here the other day, would have wanted the poor\u2019s life to be better. But the reality is that my husband can\u2019t raise his head in front of the holy lady\u201d\u201cWell, yes, the lord is right. So the budget for the operation of the estate has increased the amount of money donated to the temple for the relief of the poor from last year.\u2026.\u201d\u201cAha, so you gave more donations to the temple.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026.\u201dOh, no, that\u2019s not what I wanted.But it\u2019s no wonder. Because the temple is primarily responsible for treating the poor in this world.Anyway, even if the temple worked harder to save the poor thanks to Diana\u2019s words, my concern is not really whether the poor are better off. It\u2019s more important how to knock down the temple that\u2019s full because of Diana.Taking back donations that have already been given away simply and ignorantly may antagonize innocent young people. From now on, I have to be very careful and manipulative.\u201cHestia. Is there something wrong?\u201dKaelus asked in a businesslike tone. I shook my head quickly.\u201cNo, not really. The chief faithfully obeyed the orders of her holiness. It\u2019s just that\u2026.\u201dWhen the words were trailed, the mayor showed signs of nervousness at once. Kaelus, on the other hand, kept waiting for my words without disrupting the indifferent expression.\u201c\u2026I feel somehow sorry to take this heavy responsibility on the temple alone. From now on, it would be better to come up with a remedy at the administrative level of the estate.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dHe nodded lightly and immediately called the lord.\u201cLord, is there a vacant workshop in the estate?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s always an empty place, big or small. What size do you want?\u201dOh, is Kaelus looking for a suitable space for a soap factory now?!\u201cThe twenty workmen must be wide enough to fit in. It\u2019s not a sophisticated operation, but it\u2019s something that needs to be produced in bulk.\u201d\u201cWell, you need a pretty big workshop.\u201dHe asked Kaelus, suppressing his pounding heart.\u201cKaelus, are there 20 craftsmen here?\u201dAt my words, Kaelus shook his head bitterly.\u201cMost of them are reluctant. Mass manufacturing of soap seems to be a matter of pride to them. But there were people who accepted the persuasion. Two craftsmen decided to bring the apprentices.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s great. It was a difficult request, but thank you.\u201dIn other words, handmade soap made by craftsmen by hand was like a piece of art to them. It may be quite unpleasant for self-respecting craftsmen to produce them in large quantities at once without looking good.But whether soapmakers\u2019s pride gets hurt\u00a0 or not, it\u2019s none of my business. Because I wasn\u2019t interested in anything other than my own purpose.Kaelus told the lord.\u201cWe have a large space where more than 20 people can work at once. It doesn\u2019t necessarily have to be close to the port, but it has to be well-ventilated and have a large warehouse to store the materials.\u201d\u201cI see, my lord.\u201dThe lord and subsequent officials diligently took down instructions.Kaelus looked back at me.\u201cWhen the mass production of soap is completely settled, we can then hire the slum dwellers to pay the benefits. The craftsmen and apprentices can go back to the workshop after the technology development.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s good.\u201dI\u2019m telling you, how smart is my favorite! He thought about using a soap factory like this! Not only the spread of soap, but also welfare through public work is solved at once!\u201cI\u2019m glad you like it, Hess.\u201dI also responded with a big smile to his simple words.\u201cTo the point where I can\u2019t say it. Thank you, Kaelus.\u201dI suddenly felt awkward after I said it. I turned my head slightly.\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201d\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201dThe officials below the lord looked somewhat pleased.In the carriage back home.Tired of his first outing in a long time, Kaelus closed his eyes gently shortly after the carriage began to run.I held my breath on my own. Just in case he wakes up with my useless loud breath.\u201c\u2026.\u201dA sleeping face is like a picture,\u201c\u2026.\u201dI felt strange all of a sudden.This is definitely Kaelus in front of me. But is this real?Yes, I doubt it. I used to be the adopted daughter of lord Elia in the countryside, but now I\u2019m the wife of the rich lord of Ilion. Is it really possible to turn life around like this in just a few months in reality?I stretched out my hands that I had put on my knees. I felt a sense of bending my joints as I folded and unfolded my ten fingers.\u201c\u2026\u201dNo, this isn\u2019t enough.I pinched my cheek hard. The pain spread tinglingly.The reality is right.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dThree years have already passed by, including before the return. Too long to be just a dream.This life, possessed by Hestia, is both a reality and a fantasy to me.It is possible because this is an extension of the novel that I can abandon my own self-realization and move forward recklessly only for my favorite.And my firm sense of goal to revive my favorite is what I can have because this is his living reality.Is it ambiguous? That\u2019s right. It\u2019s really vague.After a happy ending, this life, which seems to be a second creation with my own story, is halfway between fantasy and reality.But I don\u2019t really want to conclude it either way. As long as I can\u2019t go out on my own in this novel, I have to find the meaning of living here somehow.My favorite. Kaelus.Everything else to me is just meaningless text.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 17": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayKaelus\u2019s visit to Ilion with me quickly spread to society.For some reason Madame Harmonia came to visit the marquis. She must have been quite curious about the story of my date. I guess my body would\u2019ve disappear if I waited until I went to the salon.**TN: she\u2019d be dead if she waited that long\u201cWelcome, madam. it\u2019s my first time to greet you at home like this.\u201dI welcomed her with a big smile. Harmonia also smiled softly.\u201cI\u2019m just grateful that you allowed me to visit, Marchioness Hestia.\u201dIsn\u2019t she Diana\u2019s best friend? I didn\u2019t feel any animosity or awkwardness towards me in her attitude; even though I made the fuss at Diana\u2019s tea party.Is the bond between Harmonia and Diana still the same? I should check.\u201cLast time, thank you for your quick statement of condemnation of the temple. I should have thanked you soon after, but I couldn\u2019t go to the salon because I was busy with this and that.\u201d\u201cWhoa, you had to go to Illion. How could you have? I\u2019m fine.\u201dShe lifted the cup gracefully and suddenly stopped moving.\u201cOh, by the way, marchioness. Did you hear the news? Madame Merope has decided to leave the palace.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dWhat a surprise! Madame Merope, the palace\u2019s master, is leaving her home?Harmonia continued with a bitter face.\u201cYes, even though the emperor and the crown prince tried to stop her, madame\u2019s resolve seems to be very strong. They put it to old age and health issues.\u201d\u201cBut Harmonia.\u201dI made a serious face on purpose.\u201cActually, that\u2019s all an excuse, right? I know even I\u2019ve been on the fringes of society. There\u2019s a real reason why Madame Merope wants to leave.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHarmonia put the teacup down quietly.I let out a big sigh.\u201cMadame Merope is a frustrating person, too. You\u2019ve been in the palace for decades and you still don\u2019t know when to bend.\u201d\u201c\u2026Marchioness Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead, madam.\u201dHarmonia sighed deeply at my gentle way of speaking.\u201cDo you know who her highness cares about the most?\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the emperor and His Highness Helios? They\u2019re the most noble people in this empire. Oh, if it\u2019s not that\u2026\u2026.\u201dI smiled bitterly and went on to finish my sentence.\u201c\u2026the poor people who have always been emphasized since the days of the temple\u2026?\u201dAs expected, Madam Harmonia is a person who has a good ear for words. I was haunted by the words I was spilling.\u201cYou\u2019re the marquis\u2019 wife. It was no coincidence that you were so bold at the tea party.\u201d\u201cMadam\u2026\u201dShe shook her head.\u201cActually, there are so many things I wanted to say to the marchioness. I wanted to ask you about your visit to the shrine, but I also wanted to talk about what happened at the Imperial Palace.\u201dHer tired expression bodes well. I tried to calm down my big smile and comforted Harmonia.\u201cIsn\u2019t Madam the friend that the crown princess relies on the most?\u201d What\u2019s the matter with you having such a hard time?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, because it\u2019s Hestia, not anyone else, but Her Highness Diana is still not used to being a royal.\u201dI nodded my head in understanding.\u201cI understand what you mean. Her character is too strong.\u201dAlthough I put it in a good way, in the end, Diana is stubborn as a bull.Harmonia sighed one after another.\u201cMadame Merope must have determined that she couldn\u2019t handle her anymore. Like she said, she may be mentally exhausted from getting older.\u201d\u201cThe more important it is, the more important the role of Madame Harmonia is. I\u2019ll let you know to keep your balance.\u201d\u201cMadam marquis, I\u2019m sorry to say this, but I\u2019m not confident anymore.\u201d\u201cHmm? What do you mean?\u201dI know, but I pretended I didn\u2019t know. Man, it\u2019s so hard to hold back laughter.Harmonia looked at me with serious eyes.\u201cDo you remember what I just said? Who does the crown princess care about most?\u201d\u201cYes, and I answered. His majesty the emperor, his majesty the crown prince, and the people of this empire.\u201dHarmonia\u2019s eyes are slightly bent. A strange smile in her eyes.\u201cWhy, of course that\u2019s true. But it\u2019s not the first. It is none other than the Marchioness Hestia.\u201d\u201cWhat? No way. That can\u2019t be true.\u201dI smiled and waved my hands.\u201cYou know what I\u2019m talking about. I had an accident at her tea party a while ago. Her highness wouldn\u2019t have hated me, but she wouldn\u2019t have liked me.\u201d\u201cEven being noisy means that you can\u2019t help but care about it in some way. Hestia is the only one who dares to speak directly to her enough to move her highness.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s too much. I\u2019m not that great of a person. And I can only say that straightforwardness is only useful when there are followers and listeners.\u201dHumility is humility, but the specifications are very clear.Why would I say nice things to Diana? If you leave it alone, it\u2019s about to walk down the muddy road. I don\u2019t really want to do anything other than fight with Diana.In addition, the biggest reason why she has to tell me this is because she\u2019s an ugly person, so does she think I should take the lead in getting beaten? She\u2019s hiding behind me.However, Harmonia did not give up easily.\u201cDoesn\u2019t the marchioness have the crown prince\u2019s confidence? There are not many nobles of the capital who have the same skill as Hestia.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m flattered. There are many people who are much more experienced than me. Like Countess Erinnis.\u201dI shook my head excitedly. A clear indication that I don\u2019t want to step in on Diana\u2019s business.Then Harmonia dropped her shoulders.\u201cBut\u2026 at this rate, she\u2019ll lose a lot of popularity\u2026.\u201dHmm. What does that have to do with me? Rather, it\u2019s something I want.However, if I refuse too loudly here, I will be uncomfortable when I face Harmonia in the future. She\u2019s acting like she\u2019s given up on Diana for the first time in a while, and she\u2019s pretending to help?\u201cPhew\u2026. Madam is so pitiful that my heart is weakened\u2026.\u201dI smiled helplessly.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll tell Diana straightforwardly. I\u2019ll do my best, so start cheering up, Harmonia.\u201d\u201cWhoa, the marchioness is a very kind person. I won\u2019t forget your kindness.\u201dOnly then did Harmonia\u2019s complexion brighten.Well, to a certain extent, Harmonia would\u2019ve acted like she was weak. It\u2019s not so bad though. This way I can owe her a debt. Isn\u2019t it the basic law of society to exchange what you want with each other?\u201cThen do me a favor later. Hehe.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for you any time.\u201dI shook my head gently as if I could not bear it.\u201cOh, my God. Madam\u2019s is not ordinary. Now, let\u2019s talk about something else. You want to know about Ilion?\u201d\u201cHohohohoh, we\u2019ve been talking about it for a long time. The marchioness has a very good domestic skill.\u201dThe atmosphere soon warmed up. Harmonia and I laughed and continued our conversation.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dAfter Harmonia returned, I had a headache because of the assignment I had thrown away.I know the news, so I\u2019m sure Countess Erinnis knows it. She seemed to be quite close to Diana, but she couldn\u2019t stop Madame Merope\u2019s exit.Even Madame Harmonia, who thought she was Diana\u2019s ally more than anyone else, has come to me on both hands and feet.\u201cHmm\u2026. How do I cook this\u2026.\u201dI have no intention of running to Diana as innocent as a fool and saying, \u201cPlease call me.\u201d I wanted to twist this against Dianna somehow.As the days go by, the position of crown princess will become more uncomfortable. Diana.I\u2019ll make you regret it endlessly, thinking you\u2019d rather be a marquis wife. Honestly, I wonder if you can handle that.\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dI wrote down the names of Diana and Madame Merope in my fanatic notebook and flicked a pen. Then I\u00a0 took two arrows from Merope and wrote the emperor and the crown prince, respectively. As Merope said he stopped her from leaving the palace.Then at least for Merope\u2019s future, Helios and Diana would have been at odds with each other.\u201cHelios\u2026\u201dGiven that he hasn\u2019t paged me yet, so I think Diana\u2019s still keeping the prophecy I told her a secret.I\u2019m curious. How long will it last?\u201c\u2026it\u2019s up to me.\u201dThere is no such thing as breaking a promise. Especially if it\u2019s a \u201cpromise\u201d with Diana.I\u2019m sorry, Diana.I have something. I need to talk to your husband.Humming, I drew a small picture in my fan\u2019s notebook. Heart between Diana and Helios. And the crooked line that separates it.I walked lightly into the lily palace. The strong scent of flowers is vibrating in the residence of the crown prince and his wife.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dI took a deep breath.It was Diana\u2019s taste to like flowers. Thanks to this, Kaelus also planted colorful flower trees in the artist\u2019s garden after taking care of it. Strangely enough, they\u2019re all dead now.Actually, I\u2019m not very interested in flowers or plants. If you ask me to raise them with my own hands, even if I can admire the wonderful gardens that others have raised, hmm.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d\u201cOh my god\u201dI was in the middle of breathing and was startled. Oh, I almost cursed.I was a little flustered and polite.\u201cThe empire\u2019s great little\u2026\u201d\u201cI saw something strange. There are times when you\u2019re surprised, aren\u2019t there?\u201dHelios cut my greeting off with his usual cold face.The sudden surprise sent a surge of irritation, but tried to calm down my voice.\u201cI was fascinated by the scent for a while. It\u2019s a garden that her Highness has cultivated.\u201d\u201cDiana likes gardening. She is quite well versed.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m familiar with it.\u201dHe squinted at me.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on today? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re here to see Diana.\u201dGold eyes that look at me closely. It is an urge to answer clearly, but you should not forget your original purpose due to your emotions.He bowed obediently.\u201cYes, I\u2019m here to see the crown prince. I need to ask you something.\u201dHelios turned around and said,\u201cI happened to have something to say, so that\u2019s great.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThat man has something to say to me. I apologized to Diana just like he told me to do before, what is he complaining about?I walked behind him anyway, even if it was a bit dull.\u201cDid you say you had something to ask?\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dHelios went straight into business as usual. This is was for me, but I want to hear what he has to say first.\u201cBut first, may I ask what you have to say to me?\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dHe raised his chin slightly.\u201cI heard that Kael was finally out.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dAs soon as I heard it, I was relieved. Was it about Kaelus\u2019 outing? What am I supposed to say?\u201cIllion officials asked me to greet them. So I visited with my husband.\u201d\u201cIs everything all right with Kael?\u201dHis voice sounds stiff. I can feel the traces of effort to speak casually.I replied with a small smile.\u201cIn general, he went around without any problems. He also looked around the embankment that was renovated this time.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026 But if he was generally safe, does that mean that there was a time where he wasn\u2019t?\u201dHe must have been very curious about the circumstances of Kaelus. I hesitated whether to tell the truth or not, but eventually opened my mouth because I thought it would spread rumors anyway.\u201cWe were accompanied by a doctor. He also took medicine along the way.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dHelios\u2019 countenance was slightly blurred.For some reason or another, Kaelus was an old friend of his, so it seems very unfortunate that he is insulated now.But it\u2019s strange. I can\u2019t believe Helios is showing his feelings to this extent.Somehow I asked him.\u201cDid anything depressing happen? For some reason, your highness seems to be different.\u201d\u201cHuh, you know me very well, don\u2019t you?\u201dThat is how the answer comes back after asking as much as I can. Damn it. I won\u2019t pretend to worry from now on.\u201cAs an aide to your highness, I meant as much as I knew. I didn\u2019t mean to point it out.\u201dI excused myself by suppressing my hot temper.\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios shut his mouth and looked at me for a while. Damn it. What is it this time?\u201c\u2026You think I\u2019m strange to you who just became an aide?\u201dHa. This fox-like impertinent writer is a nitwit to the end.I think I\u2019ll get caught even if I make more excuses. I told him honestly with a feeling of hope that everything would work out.\u201cYour highness is a man who rarely shows his true feelings. But today, somehow, you seem to be frustrated. You look tired\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHelios\u2019 expression was as cold as ever, but he was not as sharp as a thorn as before.I kept silent and waited for his answer. But he just looked at me with squinty eyes, and didn\u2019t respond much.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dBy the time he was getting embarrassed, he finally turned away from me.\u201c\u2026Okay. Let me hear from you.\u201dOh, what? You didn\u2019t answer my question after all!He really is like a fox. After all the nitpicking, he forgot what he had to say to me. My stomach was boiling, but I managed to keep a smile on my face.\u201cActually, I also wanted to say hello. How\u2019s your majesty doing?\u201d\u201cOh, you know what happened.\u201d\u201cYes, I heard it the other day when I saw the crown princess. Fortunately, you were vocal right away.\u201d\u201cI was.\u201dHelios nodded his head.Now that we\u2019ve opened the door, let\u2019s get to work. First of all, let\u2019s check if Diana\u2019s healing power is properly demonstrated.I asked in a low tone.\u201cYour highness the crown prince. Let me ask you one more question\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cWell, did his majesty make a full recovery? I mean, is he as healthy as ever\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios stared at me again. As if he was trying to see through my heart.In time his mouth slowly opened.\u201cWhy? Are you afraid that your prophecy messed up?\u201d\u201cAh, your highness\u2026.\u201dI\u2019m getting irritated. I can\u2019t control my expression because of my sarcastic habit of asking back.\u201cYou know I\u2019m not asking you that, don\u2019t you? I rather informed you in the hope that it would be wrong.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios is quite nervous today. There must be a reason for this.I made a bold bet.\u201cHer highness has not fully recovered from her power. Right?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHis lips stuck together.When I met Helios, the servants were always gone. It was the privilege of an aide who could always be alone with the crown prince.Thanks to him, I was able to touch a sensitive issue with ease.\u201cI was the first person to know about her majesty\u2019s condition. You don\u2019t have to hide it from me.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026She just feels a little uncomfortable moving around. Everything else is fine.\u201dAn outspoken answer.Helios was originally feisty to me. But that\u2019s a little too much today. I don\u2019t openly express hostility, but I\u2019m very wary of everything I say and do.Are you doubting me? Because I had an argument with Diana at the tea party? That\u2019s the only reason why Helios is exceptionally sensitive today.If I had heard from Diana that Diana\u2019s healing power would be gone, she would have grabbed me by the collar and shook me from the beginning.If so, it is a head-on breakthrough.\u201cYour highness, I\u2019ve told you before. My wisdom is useful only if you believe it is true.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut now that I see you, I think you have some doubts about me.\u201dHelios raised his chin and folded his arms with perfect long legs crossed.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to give me advice, why don\u2019t you quit?\u201d\u201cI am ready to resign my position as an aide if you do not wish to. It\u2019s just that\u2026.\u201dI deliberately lengthened the end of the sentence and watched his countenance. Helios\u2019 brow was getting deeper and deeper.\u201cHowever, what?\u201d\u201c\u2026Didn\u2019t Diana say anything?\u201d\u201c!\u201dLittle sparks flew from Helios\u2019 golden eyes.His fatal weakness, Diana.The reason why he\u2019s expressing doubt to me now is because I pushed Diana hard at the tea party.Sure enough, as soon as Diana was mentioned, Helios\u2019 spirits became terrible.\u201cYou attack my wife in everything. It\u2019s too obvious.\u201d\u201cWhat about her health? As soon as the accident happened, she poured her healing power into it!\u201d\u201c!\u201dHelios clenched his teeth and stared at me. If you kill someone with your eyes, that\u2019s the kind of eyes you have, right?I sighed with envy.\u201cHoo\u2026 I brought my foresight, but I won\u2019t tell you this time.\u201d\u201cWhat? Are you going to let go of your duty in front of me now?\u201dThe more dangerous the opponent comes out, the more calm I am.\u201cBecause I don\u2019t have to tell you. Her Highness Diana will soon reveal it herself.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHelios has hardened.\u201cSir, I\u2019d like to say one last thing before I leave. Who do you think is the most prestigious person in this palace?\u201d\u201cHestia, you\u2019d better moderate your profanity.\u201dIt was a cool voice, but I\u2019m not afraid.\u201cHer Highness is the crown princess. Not his majesty, not Helios. Even Madame Merope couldn\u2019t stand this strange phenomenon and ran away. Everyone, including me, is just looking at the crown prince\u2026.\u201d\u201cHestia. That\u2019s it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI really shut up this time. For Helios\u2019 anger was extraordinary.Fiery yet frightening golden eyes. A life so frightening that one\u2019s whole body is horrified without realizing it.Oh, is this the original male character\u2019s pose?I stooped rather modestly as if I were under the weight of an impossible force.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. The slip of the tongue went too far, your highness.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dLeaving behind a cold, piercing gaze, I turned around with courtesy. Without anyone knowing, pulling up the tip of my lips at an angle.\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dIn the carriage to the house, the corners of my pouting mouth did not subside.It was not easy because Helios was firmly upholding a wall, but I succeeded in throwing everything I aimed for.\u201cProphecy\u201d that Diana and I know. And the ranking of the imperial palace that is being overturned.Although it was briefly mentioned, if it was a smart and quick-witted Helios, he would have fully understood what it means.\u201cThey need to have an in-depth conversation.\u201dHelios was pretty nervous today, by the way. It\u2019s not just because of what I said, but I feel like he\u2019s already been under a lot of stress before.\u201c\u2026Is it because he didn\u2019t meet his friends?\u201dAs soon as he saw me, he asked after Kaelus, and he looked tired.But I don\u2019t feel sorry or pity. He didn\u2019t care about Caelus having a hard time playing around. He\u2019s acting like he\u2019s curious now.I don\u2019t like it.\u201cTsk\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s ridiculous. Helios\u2019 nerves were on edge. Is there anyone who can comfort him? What the hell is Diana doing, loving him? If you\u2019re tired, shouldn\u2019t you go to your wife who can\u2019t live and die because she likes you?Is there already a conflict between the two? You\u2019ve only been married a few months?Before the return, after the death of Kaelus, I had completely cut off social contact, so I never saw the crown prince and his wife up close. So I also heard the news of the palace through hearsay like ordinary people.It was almost two years after the end of the novel that the discord between the two couples became known to the common people at the time. However, it may be earlier than that, that that actually began to crack.If I knew this would happen, I would have worked harder. I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d go back like this then.Anyway, I appeared in front of his eyes for no reason today, so I think I became the target of Helios\u2019 anger. But I\u2019m not particularly upset because I\u2019ve scratched his insides.**TN: upset himThe carriage came to a smooth stop in front of the porch.\u201cHow was it, Lady Hestia?\u201dThe butler, Uross, greeted me back from my departure.\u201cIs everything alright with Kaelus?\u201d\u201d\u201cYes. After taking a walk and taking a nap, he read a book in his study.\u201dKaelus\u2019 daily routine was also organized quite regularly. a sign that his daily routine was gradually recovering.Alas, what a wonderful phenomenon.My favorite, who was wandering in despair, is gradually escaping from the darkness, and cracks slowly began to form between the original couple, who tried to be happy only by themselves while leaving him behind.But the real game hasn\u2019t even started yet.My heart swelled with anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe garden of Countess Erinnis.The tea table where only the countess and I sat was filled with all kinds of luxurious snacks.\u201cWow, I\u2019m really enjoying this luxury thanks to Hestia.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean, thanks to me? It\u2019s all because of the virtue that the countess has accumulated.\u201dWith her experienced social skills, Erinnis did not miss a golden opportunity and entered Diana\u2019s friends category at once. She was almost the only married adult noblewoman in the group.These high-quality refreshments were all the same. They were a bribe offered to Erinnis by prominent figures in society to get connections to the crown princess.But to be honest, it wasn\u2019t enough for her last name. It\u2019s not about the snacks, it\u2019s about Erinnis\u2019 influence.She looked carefully at my expression, which didn\u2019t smile broadly.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s up to marchioness\u2019 standards.\u201d\u201cOh, actually\u2026\u201dI moistened my lips with tea and opened my mouth.\u201cI wanted the countess to be closer to the saintess than Madam Harmonia.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dThe countess smiled bitterly.\u201cThe crown princess doesn\u2019t open her heart easily with the simple sweet talk. The gift didn\u2019t work\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cMadame Merope\u2019s job was like that. I was a step behind Harmonia. It\u2019s not like my pride has been hurt.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dThe incident in which Merope left the palace was shocking in society. She came all the way to Harmonia and asked me to persuade Diana.But I met Helios instead of Diana. What if I didn\u2019t want to meet Diana the way Harmonia wanted me to?Erinnis shook her head.\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to change direction. Marchioness, you can\u2019t do this.\u201dI glanced at the snacks on the table.\u201cI know. You\u2019ve already received a lot, so I\u2019ll have to do something.\u201d\u201cSo, do you have any good ideas?\u201dErinnis folded her eyes brightly and smiled. I smirked and shook my head gently.\u201cHow could I be so sharp?\u201d\u201cOh, Marchioness Hestia. Don\u2019t say anything you don\u2019t know. The society is already admiring your brilliance.\u201dI know she\u2019s buttering me up a little too much to get what she wants. But this is also a social skill.As if I really couldn\u2019t help it, I let out a sigh.\u201cPhew, since the countess has praised this humble woman so much\u2026. I\u2019ll just suggest the direction you should take. I still have to think more about the detailed picture.\u201d\u201cOh, of course!\u201dErinnis\u2019 face was visibly bright.\u201cThen\u2026 move the people around the crown princess, countess.\u201d\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t think of that!\u201d\u201cHoo, hoo, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be very good at this.\u201dIt would be better for the prestigious Erinnis to capture the aristocrats than me. I have the weakness that I come from a humble background.There must be some young people who are frightened by Diana\u2019s stout behavior. There must be some who can\u2019t keep up with the frugality she pursues.That\u2019s where Erinnis has to work.\u201cThe marchioness\u2019 advice was very helpful. Thank you.\u201dAnd she understands everything without me explaining it. As expected, she\u2019s useful.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m more grateful.\u201d~~~~When I got home, Uross said, \u201cMaster is waiting, madam.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dMy favorite is waiting for me. Then I\u2019ll leave it for later.I checked first before I went.\u201cDo you have any idea what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cWell, a man came from the palace.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dWe looked at each other and nodded knowingly.If a palace man had been there, it must have been from Helios. If my hunch is right, the message would be to see each other.When I met Helios, the first thing he asked was how Kaelus was doing. Moreover, his state of mind was very sharp.Perhaps he missed his old friend who guessed what he was thinking just by looking at his eyes.I headed straight to Kaelus\u2019 room without stalling.\u201cKaelus. It\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cOh, come on in.\u201dI quickly opened the door to the voice from inside.\u201cHess.\u201dI\u2019m already dizzy from the title. What do you mean, \u201cHess\u201d again?The end of the pretty long silver hair, loosely tied together, flowed down in front of the shoulders. Because of my favorite, there was a complete war in my head. A beautiful, lovely war.I gently cleared my throat \u2013 actually my heart \u2013 and asked.\u201cI heard someone came from the imperial palace. What\u2019s the matter?\u201dKaelus pointed at the envelope on the table with a blank face. A letter from the imperial palace with a golden seal on it laid there.\u201cI have been ordered by the crown prince. He\u2019s asking me to meet him somewhere quietly.\u201d\u201cA\u2026 meeting, quietly\u2026\u2026?\u201dMy head went blank for a moment. It\u2019s an order? So it\u2019s an order?\u201cYes, it\u2019s a public summons to the marquis as a crown prince. I can\u2019t ever refuse.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dHe didn\u2019t even give him a choice to say no. Did you miss your friend that much, prince?\u201cI\u2019m coming with you.\u201d\u201cNo, the crown prince asked for a solo meeting. Even if you follow me, you can\u2019t go in anyway.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dWow. That\u2019s so mean, Helios. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re using your crown prince status like this. A foxy fellow, what a cowardly child.I think he did this because he thought I would follow him if he called Kaelus. Damn. I\u2019m gonna take back everything I felt sorry for. Helios, you clever man.\u201cYou look angry.\u201d\u201c\u2026a little bit.\u201dI tried to repress my anger. Then he chuckled.\u201cHeli wants to see me somewhere other than the palace, so he must want to see me without Diana knowing.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dYes, it\u2019s a little comforting. It\u2019s worth the effort to shake Helios.Kaelus buried himself deep on the sofa.\u201cLet me hear from you first. That\u2019s how we can get things right.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dAs expected, his personality is much calmer than mine.After a long sigh, I summed up what I had said when I met Helios.\u201cI asked why the Emperor\u2019s condition did not improve despite the power of her holiness, and I asked why Madame Merope left the palace.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dPurple eyes with slightly drooping eyes. It\u2019s a habit that comes out when he\u2019s lost in thought.Soon his mouth opened.\u201cIf you doubted Diana\u2019s healing powers, Heli would have been quite sensitive.\u201d\u201cYes, I almost got kicked out.\u201dI affirmed myself weakly.Kaelus asked in a perfectly businesslike tone.\u201cDo you have any idea why he wants to see me?\u201dMy favorite is so rational that I had already calmed down my boiling emotions.\u201cYes, it\u2019s surprisingly simple. The crown prince is very mentally exhausted right now.\u201d\u201cWhoa.\u201dThis is why I\u2019m angry with Helios. When Kaelus needs help, he doesn\u2019t look back at all, but when he needs help, he finds Kaelus.Kaelus even declared the end of their friendship because he didn\u2019t like the treatment. But the order of the crown prince. There\u2019s a limit to being brazen.But even though I\u2019m angry like this, my favorite is always calm.\u201cI don\u2019t have much to say to Helios anyway. You don\u2019t have to worry too much, either.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus slowly rose to his feet.\u201cI\u2019ll be loyal to the imperial family. as a peer of the empire.\u201d\u201c\u2026 The crown prince is wary of me. He\u2019ll think I\u2019m hostile to the imperial family.\u201dWhen I said it anxiously, I got a sarcastic reply.\u201cWell, isn\u2019t that true?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dYeah, well, I don\u2019t have to deny it. But let\u2019s get this straight.\u201cI don\u2019t hate the royal family of this country. But there\u2019s a reason for the saint and her husband.\u201d\u201cWell, that would be more accurate. I told them I had to apologize.\u201dFortunately, Kaelus properly understood that I did not have treasonous thoughts. Funnily, I felt a little relieved. I almost became a traitor.His voice continued.\u201cI won\u2019t get in your way anyway. So don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not my plan that I\u2019m worried about, it\u2019s you.\u201d\u201cYes, including that.\u201dAn infinitely cold way of speaking without any emotional agitation.It sounds like he\u2019s worried at best, but that\u2019s actually the way Kaelus really is. The sweet second lead setting was not a blessing given to me. It belonged to Diana, the heroine.This contradictory feeling that is both bitter and relieved. It is fortunate that he is gradually returning to my original favorite.I feel like I\u2019m doing my part in this world.\u201c\u2026 I see. Have a safe trip.\u201dHe gradually straightened out his hardened face.Kaelus looked at me in silence. He ducked his head slightly and deflected his gaze.\u201cInstead, I\u2019ll be waiting around there until the solo meeting is over. With your doctor, just in case.\u201d\u201cAs you please.\u201dI turned back, with a faint smile.~~~~A few days later, the day came when he had to obey the order of the crown prince.Kaelus, dressed in a suit for the first time in a long time, was still my favorite, even though he was thinner and thinner than before.I watched him half excited and half worried. Then to me, Kaelus said indifferently.\u201cIt\u2019s not something I can avoid. It\u2019s no use looking at me like that.\u201d\u201cI know\u2026.\u201dDamn it. It makes me angry again. To make it impossible for Kaelus, who is still recovering, to say no.But regardless of how my stomach was boiling, Kaelus checked his clothes with a calm face.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s go.\u201dAs Kaelus and I reached the front door, the doctor who had been waiting in advance bowed lightly.\u201cI\u2019ll go with Lady Hestia, Lord Kaelus.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWearing a suit, long silver hair neatly brushed, and even. At least from the outside right now, he didn\u2019t seem like a sick person.I\u2019m even worried that Helios might treat him carelessly because he looks fine.Kaelus got into a marquis carriage. And his doctor and I followed in a small carriage for employees.\u201c\u2026.\u201dDue to the complicated screening process, I naturally became silent.The doctor tried to reassure me with a relaxed tone.\u201cIf the marquis\u2019 wife is around, he\u2019ll be fine.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s alone with the crown prince.\u201d\u201cBut there won\u2019t be an emergency. In the event of an accident, his highness will call us immediately.\u201d\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dThe doctor is right. Helios just wants to see Kaelus not because he\u2019s trying to hurt him.If Kaelus had a seizure, Helios would be more surprised.\u201cSo just relax for now, marchioness.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI know. Why am I so restless?~~~~The place Helios designated was a quiet mansion in the capital. A secret place that appeared in the original novel.When he showed Diana this place, Helios and Diana began to ride the hidden route in earnest. Damn it, of all places.Without knowing my feelings, the doctor looked around with small admiration.\u201cOh, this is\u2026\u201dMy voice answering him was very stiff.\u201cIt\u2019s the crown prince\u2019s secret villa. The crown princess is familiar with this place, and I doubt it\u2019s okay to meet Kaelus here.\u201d\u201cIs there anything you don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing.\u201dWhile we were talking, Kaelus was getting out of the carriage and walking into the mansion.My doctor and I also came down.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThere seems to be no one around, but there must be shadow guards hiding throughout the garden.After passing through the front door, a man appeared who seemed to be the caretaker of the mansion.\u201cYou two wait here.\u201dI had no choice but to stop.The caretaker poured us a fragrant tea. I asked him as I watched the tea dripping up.\u201cBut isn\u2019t this villa a place that the crown princess knows about?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cDoes she know he\u2019s meeting the marquis today?\u201d\u201cNot that I know of. His majesty the crown prince has visited this place very secretly.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s such a familiar place that the purpose is overshadowed.\u201d\u201cThe only people who approached this place were his highness and you, according to the escort report. As long as we remain silent, her highness will not know.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a lot of confidence.\u201dThe housekeeper bowed politely again at my displeased tone.\u201cI understand your concern. But the only person who can enter this place without the order of the crown prince is his majesty.\u201d\u201cDo you know that the imperial palace is already in the clutches of the holy princess?\u201dI shot back deliberately. Then his expression became quite heavy.\u201cI\u2019ll be careful with my words.\u201d\u201cThat should be the case.\u201dEven if he says it with a smile, it will not work. The more serious and important the \u2018request\u2019 is, the more difficult it is to do.Now that I\u2019ve spoken, at least Diana\u2019s words in this villa will be much weaker. I don\u2019t know the use of saying anything to this caretaker right now, but it\u2019ll all come in handy someday.Anyway, wherever I go, I have to be diligent to catch them all at once.**TN: get them on her side~~~~\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA silent drawing room. Time has long gone by.The conversation is taking longer than expected. Is Kaelus all right?Perhaps the doctor thought the same thing, he spoke carefully.\u201cIt\u2019s taking a little while.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut maybe it\u2019s a good sign. Marchioness, that means he\u2019s recovered.\u201d\u201cI suppose so\u2026?\u201dI sighed quietly. Yeah, let\u2019s just take it positively.Then.\u201c!\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe doctor and I looked up almost at the same time.I could hear the footsteps of several people who were mumbling. Helios soon appeared. And then Kaelus.I stood up immediately and bowed politely.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHelios glanced at me in courtesy and went out of the mansion without saying a word. His air was cold, but now there was no time to care.I turned straight to Kaelus.\u201cKael\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dA frightening look and a pallid complexion.The doctor approached him quickly even if I didn\u2019t signal. Then he touched his hand and gave him a prescribed sedative.\u201cIt will help you relax. Go ahead and start drinking, marquis.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus\u2019 hand trembled slightly as he took the medicine bottle.The doctor spoke to me reassuringly.\u201cIt\u2019s because he\u2019s suddenly relaxed. It\u2019s not a seizure, so don\u2019t worry, Lady Hestia,\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dNevertheless, my expression didn\u2019t go away easily.Finally, Kaelus opened his mouth.\u201cLet\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cYes, Kaelus.\u201dI put my hand on his hand.It was cold, but warm.~~~~We came separately when we came, but we all got in a big carriage when we went back.Kaelus kept his eyes closed the whole time in the carriage. I couldn\u2019t ask about Helios with the doctor there, so I just looked out the window.So quietly, I came back home.\u201cI need to take a rest.\u201dFortunately, Kaelus himself admitted that he needed a break.\u201cYes. Don\u2019t mind the outside and take a good rest.\u201dI answered this without hesitation.Honestly, I\u2019m dying to know what he talked about with Helios. But more importantly, was the condition of Kaelus. Just because I can\u2019t hear it right away doesn\u2019t mean anything happened.I have to wait.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI came back to the room quietly.I asked the lady-in-waiting to make a strong coffee. Soon the room was filled with the savory aroma of coffee.I took a sip without sugar. It was bitter enough that my face frowned automatically. My mind went blank as well.\u201c\u2026\u201dCertainly, Kaelus has recovered.Think about the first time he had a solo meeting with Helios after the suicide attempt. A storm that turned the whole house upside down. He broke the terrace window and even saw blood.How calm today is compared to then. Although he went to rest as soon as he got home from mental fatigue, he didn\u2019t have any seizures.It was an encouraging enough phenomenon.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dThe flow of thoughts led to the appearance of two people coming out of the villa.Helios and Kaelus never laughed. Perhaps the conversation between the two did not go well.In fact, there was nothing to talk about between the two of them. I\u2019m sure Helios was whining about how hard it was.In fact, Kaelus is not in a state of ease enough to accept the complaints. It\u2019s too much to take care of himself, so he can\u2019t listen to his old friend\u2019s complaints.I don\u2019t know what Helios wanted and called Kaelus by issuing an \u201corder\u201d for, but the conclusion was that it didn\u2019t go his way anyway.Good job. My favorite.~~~~A few hours later, I sat down at the dinner table with Kaelus.\u201cHow do you feel?\u201dI asked cautiously, and his eyes glanced at me.\u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty better after a nap.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a relief. I was worried because you looked so stiff earlier.\u201dKaelus replied with a grave face.\u201cYou must be curious about what happened to Helios.\u201dI thought about how to answer it, but eventually, I nodded frankly.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dKaelus opened his mouth with a wry smile.\u201cAs you say, Heli looked pretty exhausted. First of all, he apologized for calling me by order.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dWhy did he do something that needed apologizing for? I swallowed something that popped out of my stomach.Instead, asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s his business?\u201dHe glanced at me while he was serving soup. But soon he continued to eat again.\u201cI heard there\u2019s no one around him to trust.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dExpectedly.When he said was ridiculous, I laughed.\u201cSo I answered. \u2018If you don\u2019t believe you, I don\u2019t have to be an aide.\u2019 \u201cThat\u2019s true. What\u2019s the point of having someone you can\u2019t trust next to you?\u201cAnd whether you believe it or not is also a matter of choice, I said. Trusting someone is actually a determined decision.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dReal phenomena can be interpreted according to the viewer. Therefore, whether to trust or not trust this is a decision based on each interpretation and judgment.Therefore, there is no \u2018no\u2019 belief in the world. It\u2019s just that youchose to believe in.I asked Kaelus with some cynicism.\u201cWill the crown prince choose to trust me? When I saw his attitude, I felt like he had already decided not to believe me.\u201d\u201cWell, but it\u2019s not easy to give up your foresight.\u201dAfter answering me, he added after a pause.\u201c\u2026Helios is always like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMy mouth is bitter.Helios is rofan, Kaelus. Perfect spec, getting whatever he wants.He wanted to hold Diana in his arms and at the same time keep his friendship with Kaelus. At least that\u2019s how the original novel ended. A perfect happy ending where nothing is lost.Was there a case where the protagonist in the rofan gave up something else for something precious? Even if it develops like that, authors should be prepared for angry comments and falling views.From the beginning, the novel was designed so that the main character would take over everything.\u201cI was blatantly at odds with the saintess. That\u2019s why the crown prince doesn\u2019t trust me.\u201dThe reason why Helios is so confused. Because he\u2019s greedy for both Diana and I.If he chooses to believe in Diana, he must abandon my prophecies. On the contrary, if he decides to trust me, he has to doubt Diana.The novel is over. Now, every time you choose something, you\u2019ll lose something else.The natural course of the world.Helios will have to pay for the choice he has not paid so far. Whether he\u2019s forced to miss it or give it up on his own.\u201cIf Heli fires you, will there be a disruption in what you\u2019re trying to do?\u201dKaelus asked in a very dry tone.I smiled lightly.\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter at all.\u201dIt\u2019s rather welcome. I can use the future I know entirely for Kaelus.\u201cWow. Is that so?\u201dKaelus nodded with a blank face. Then I concentrated on the meal again.I turned my eyes to the plate, too.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHmm. Think about it. Helios.Because you\u2019re the only one who pays for the choice.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 19": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA few days have passed since then.I\u2019m secretly waiting for a notice of dismissal from the imperial palace, but I haven\u2019t heard from him.\u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? My goodness.\u201dI grumbled and poured cold coffee into my mouth. Caffeine is the best when you use your brain.\u201cSigh\u2026 How can I make a rumor that I did a good job?\u201dThe document I\u2019m looking into now was none other than about the soap supply business.Finally, craftsmen and apprentices arrived at the soap factory and were conducting mass production research. It was to quantify the production process after deciding what to put in and take out of the soap used by the nobles.In the meantime, I have to think about how to distribute the large amount of soap produced to the territory.In fact, spraying people with soap was not difficult. You can just hand it out to each house.But more importantly, people were diligent in using soap.\u201cWhat can I do to make the soap work\u2026?\u201dIt was no use just putting soap in the house. You have to wash your hands well with this, but humans are lazy, so if there was no reason, they would never wash their hands.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dIt didn\u2019t work very well to explain that you don\u2019t get sick by using soap. Because people here are obsessed with the idea that the reason for getting sick is God\u2019s anger or punishment.We need to do something else.Should I say you\u2019ll be fined if I don\u2019t use it? No, then they might hide it secretly.Should I say that God is happy when you wash up? No. I don\u2019t want to do this under the name of the temple. Moreover, the ultimate goal of the soap business is to weaken the temple.\u201cUgh\u2026.I have a headache\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t think of a good way.Almost instinctively I reached out to the coffee cup. An empty glass, and a lighter kettle.\u201cWhat? Did you finish drinking already?\u201dI called the maid. Soon a young maid ran into the room.\u201cAre you done, ma\u2019am?\u201d\u201cYeah. Can you fill up some coffee here?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dThe child, who answered frequently, added in a somewhat pleasant tone.\u201cThese days, some ladies have begun to enjoy coffee. I guess the rumor has spread that her tree wife likes coffee.\u201dShe soon disappeared with a brisk walk.\u201c\u2026.\u201dBut I hardened silently. So, is coffee getting popular?\u201cThe fad\u2026!\u201dOh, my God. I guess my brain must be getting old.Or maybe I lost my original world identity by assimilating into this world.\u201cDamn it, we can advertise it!\u201dIt\u2019s ridiculous. I guess my senses have completely disappeared because I live in a novel.Advertising is informing people of a product. And to induce consumption. Even web novels are advertised!It doesn\u2019t mean that there is no \u2018advertising\u2019 at all in this world. From word of mouth between people to a policy of pushing at the imperial palace, it is all a kind of advertisement.Moreover, I lived in modern times, where advertisements come out every time I turn my eyes. And yet why I couldn\u2019t think of this earlier.I scrambled through Madam Harmonia\u2019s information.I need to find out who is the most popular these days in the Ilion estate. Shouldn\u2019t we use the best model?\u201cI\u2019m going to make the soap scent all over the place\u2026.\u201dSo I\u2019ll make up for my stupidity.~~~~Soon after, two special visitors came to the marquis.\u201cOh, my God\u2026 No way, actress Helen!\u201d\u201cWhat? No, Pollux came with you!\u201dSeeing the best theater actors in imperial city enter the front door, the users of the marquis made a great fuss.As a very precious guest, even if not noble, I, the wife of the marquis, came out and greeted them personally.\u201cWelcome. Thank you for your hard walk.\u201dThe two siblings answered with bright smiles.\u201cMarchioness Hestia, the most talked-about woman in the world, called me, and I\u2019ll put abuse the rest of the day.\u201dSoon J moved to the drawing-room and sat face to face with them.\u201cThe reason I invited you today is because I have a big favor to ask.\u201dHelen and Pollux looked at each other once and then at me again.\u201cIf a noble asks, of course I\u2019ll listen.\u201d\u201cWhoa, you don\u2019t have to put it up like that. You all know that I was a commoner, but then I became the adopted daughter of the lord of Elea.\u201dTreat them with frankness. A flattering remark means no.The two actors looked more serious.\u201cAnything we can do to help.\u201dOnly then did I get to the point with a nod.\u201cIt\u2019s not that difficult. With the support of the marquis, we\u2019re going to mass-produce low-end soap, and I\u2019d like you to set an example for all the people of Illion to use. Of course, I\u2019ll give you a good example.\u201dAlmost the same thing was fashionable in Ilion and the capital. Helena and Pollux, the most popular stars in the capital, are also the hottest in Illion.I\u2019m literally about to sign the best advertising models right now.\u201cI want people to use soap voluntarily. Every time they go out and come back, and before they go to sleep.\u201d\u201cYou mean that often?\u201dPollux asked, slightly startled.I confirmed.\u201cYes, the more, the better. If you use soap well, you\u2019ll be as handsome as you are.\u201d\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s\u2026\u201dWhy are you sweating, Pollux?Since we\u2019re going to do it, we have to make it clear. This is all the psychology of advertising. It\u2019s the same effect. It was the same principle that pretty celebrities appeared as models in cosmetics advertisements.Helen said with a suppressed look.\u201cWell, if you use marquis\u2019 soap, it looks attractive to the opposite sex, right?\u201d\u201cOh, of course.\u201dI put the prepared documents in front of them.\u201cThis is a contract for my request. The reason for this documentation is that I want you to do your best.\u201dThe two read the contract carefully and each signed underneath.\u201cFounders and jewelers often make similar requests. Don\u2019t worry. I will not fail to meet the marquis\u2019 expectations.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. We\u2019re going to show off our skills in Illion, just like we did on stage, marchioness.\u201dI also responded with a smile to the two confident siblings\u2019 words.\u201cYes, I believe you, Helena, Pollux.\u201d~~~~Not long after, several prototypes were sent from the soap factory in Illion. I went through the samples one by one with Kaelus.\u201cThe craftsman did a lot of research, Kaelus.\u201dUnscented things. Something a little hard. Something slightly soft. Pigments, and so on.Kaelus replied dryly.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to ask me when it\u2019s your business\u201d\u201cWell, I thought the lord would know best what the Illion people like.\u201dTo express my true feelings, I like that I\u2019m doing something with my favorite. But let\u2019s hide my foolishness.Kaelus shook his head.\u201cYou know the taste of commoners better than I do.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good excuse.But he didn\u2019t seem interested, and his finger touched one of the samples.\u201cA firm one would be better. But it\u2019s better to add a mild scent. There are many commoners who admire the aristocracy.\u201d\u201cOh, I see!\u201dOh, Kaelus made a very important point.Here soap is the exclusive property of the aristocracy. If you are a commoner who admires the aristocracy, you will definitely like the cheap version.\u201cThank you, Kaelus! I\u2019ll have to reply to the lord as soon as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dHe just raised his hand indifferently to my greeting.It was a very Kaelus-like response, so I laughed naturally.I got all the soap samples and came back to my room. And I wrote back to the lord as Kaelus advised me a while ago.\u201cThe texture is a bit firm. You don\u2019t have to add any pigment, but make sure to add even a small amount of scent\u2026\u201dThe foamy soft material may feel like it wears off quickly from the common people\u2019s point of view. In that sense, Kaelus\u2019 choice was very wise.I laid on my back in bed.\u201cHmm\u2026 How can there be so much room for improvement?\u2026.\u201dI\u2019m telling you, I felt a wall in my favorite. Perfection.I hope Kaelus gets well soon and chews up Helios and Diana completely.\u201cCome to think of it, what are they doing these days?\u201dI suddenly became curious.Helios is quiet without much news after meeting me and Kaelus one after another. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve had a fight with Diana.\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dSitting still and waiting for an aide\u2019s dismissal notice from the crown prince also became somewhat boring.Let\u2019s go out to the salon in Harmonia. I have something to put on her just in the nick of time.~~~~\u201cMarchioness Hestia!\u201dEven though it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve visited the salon, Madam Harmonia has always welcomed me.I smiled apologetically.\u201cYou must have been very busy these days I wanted to stop by often, but I couldn\u2019t help it.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re here.\u201dDid Diana curse at me too much? Despite some signs of discomfort, she was still alive.I\u2019ll figure out the atmosphere while talking.\u201cI\u2019ve done what Madam asked me to do the other day. I\u2019m not very satisfied.\u201d\u201cOh, oh\u2026.\u201dA request to advise Diana about Madame Merope\u2019s departure from the palace. I know she\u2019s putting the hard work on me, but I\u2019ll do it for her.I said with a deep sigh.\u201cI haven\u2019t seen her royal highness in person. Instead, I hinted to the crown prince. When I met him as an aide, he said something.\u201d\u201cWhat did the crown prince say?\u201dMadam Harmonia asked back, a little anxious. I smiled bitterly.\u201cOf course he was upset.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know, madam, well, don\u2019t you? How much the crown prince cares about the holy princess.\u201dI added, shaking my head.\u201cHis highness is displeased with even facing me, so I did my best to tell him about it.\u201d\u201cOh, yes, I understand.\u201dHarmonia also looked sad.Now, it\u2019s time to show off. It\u2019s time to solve your questions.\u201cBut Madam, I\u2019m half expecting and half doubting, too. I wonder if His Highness Helios has delivered my honest words to Her Highness Diana?\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dWith a smile on her face, she lifts the teacup and sneaks away from answering.But I\u2019m not the one to back off.\u201cHarmonia, just give me a hint. What does Her Highness Diana write these days?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve said something difficult to the crown prince in spite of the profanity, but I deserve to hear that, don\u2019t I need to know what\u2019s going on behind me so I can keep a low profile?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt looks difficult, but let\u2019s push it a little harder.\u201cActually, I\u2019m going to be kicked out of my aide\u2019s office because of this. I wasn\u2019t going to tell you this\u2026.\u201d\u201cNo, marchioness! Is that true?\u201dOh. Finally, she reacts.My shoulders dropped\u00a0 as much as they could.\u201cYes\u2026 I didn\u2019t say it from the beginning because I was afraid I\u2019d be worried for no reason. Actually, on that day, the crown prince was very angry\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, my\u2026! I\u2019m sorry, marchioness. I\u2019m the reason for all the trouble.\u2026\u201dHarmonia was deeply sorry and at a loss.Now that I\u2019ve pulled enough, I\u2019m going to push it. Anyway, playing hard to get is effective only when you do it moderately.\u201cSo let me know just a little bit. What does the crown princess say?\u201dI asked once more with a slight smile.She flapped her lips, hesitating, and finally spilled the information I wanted.\u201c\u2026 Her highness\u2026.\u201dI waited patiently for the slow voice.\u201c\u2026I think she\u2019s nervous about something. Not just certain things, but everything around her seems to feel that way.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u2026\u201dPretending to feel sorry for her. Like I sympathize with Diana\u2019s feelings.And I pretended to analyze the situation in a cautious tone.\u201cMadam Merope\u2019s work is going to hurt her a lot. She was almost like an aunt to the crown prince. I heard that you tried to persuade Madam Merope.\u201d\u201cYes, Lady Marquis. And it also seems to have hurt her feelings.\u201d\u201cOh, my\u2026.\u201dI was sighing on the outside, but I was laughing on the inside.Helios, who was always on her side in everything, must have realized that\u2019s not the case anymore. Diana, I feel sorry for you.And that\u2019s not the only thing to worry about. You have to hide carefully that your sacred power is about to run out.Perhaps if Helios, who noticed my implication, had ever spoken of the problem, Diana would be in a state of panic. Whether to keep it secret or confess honestly.Things are going really interesting.Helios is weighing who to trust, me or Diana, and Diana is just as anxious. It\u2019s obvious that their relationship is not the same now.Then I\u2019d better cut off the rest of the rope she\u2019s holding.To make her more anxious.After making up my mind, I lowered my voice to a low pitch.\u201cBut madam, I\u2019m saying this because it\u2019s in front of madam\u2026.\u201d\u201c?\u201dHarmonia opened her eyes wide.I spoke deliberately and slowly.\u201c\u2026so if the relationship between you two is\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, marchioness\u2026!\u201dHarmonia freaked out at once. But I persistently carried on persistently.\u201cI know it\u2019s a guess now. But we must always think of the worst. In particular, Diana\u2019s relationship with the nobles is not that smooth.\u201d\u201cLady Marquis, but that\u2019s too\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know. I know, Harmonia. That\u2019s why it\u2019s \u2018what if.\u2019 \u201c\u201c\u2026\u201dHarmonia clenched her lips.In a subtle tone, I added fuel to her suspicion, which had just begun to rise.\u201cIf your relationship starts to crack, her highness will not be the same as before.\u201d\u201c\u2026But the temple will support her.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. Temple.\u201dHarmonia\u2019s words raised my eyebrows.\u201cYes, the temple will try to help her, Her Highness Diana.\u201dA breathless rush.\u201cBut will the nobles watch the temple gain power? Rather, the imperial family protecting the holy lady will be attacked by aristocratic forces. Accusing them of joining hands with the temple.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dHarmonia\u2019s expression became serious, thinking I had a point.Now, it\u2019s time for a wedge.\u201cMadam, there\u2019s no way the second Duke Orcus won\u2019t show up again.\u201d\u201c!\u201dShe stared at me with her eyes wide open.I knew what it meant, so I smiled and waved my hands.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean that our marquis will be like that. Above all, my husband is an old friend of the crown prince.\u201dIt is not yet known in society that Kaelus has broken off with Helios. It would be better to keep my mouth shut until it comes out naturally.Instead, it alluded to the possibility.\u201cBut I\u2019m sure someone will rally the disgruntled aristocrats. Unfortunately, the current imperial family does not have the power to deal with the whole aristocracy alone.\u201dStubbornly silent, she finally shook her head.\u201c\u2026Lady Marquis is right. In the days of the Duke Orcus, it was possible because the marquis was a strong ally.\u201dAs expected, she\u2019s quick to grasp the situation.I grinned.\u201cI agree with your ideals. But I don\u2019t want to use the power of the temple to achieve that. First of all, I\u2019m an aristocrat.\u201dThe nobles do not antagonize the existence of the temple itself. Because there are many devout believers among the nobles.But being politicized by religion is a completely different matter than being personally religious. Whether the temple is friendly to the aristocracy or not, the aristocracy never wants to see more competitors who will fight with them.\u201cMadam Harmonia. To continue to support Her Highness Diana\u2026\u2026 It can be a lot of pressure.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have to think carefully. To be honest, I don\u2019t want to stay on a sinking ship.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHarmonia could not say a word with a clouded complexion.Let\u2019s wrap up the conversation.Having said it so explicitly, the concept of \u201ca commoner-born aristocrat who is not used to hiding her innermost thoughts\u201d seems to have been maintained well.There is no fear that she will tell Diana what I said in detail. Harmonia herself was the one who asked for Madam Merope in the first place.\u201cPhew, Madam is a trustworthy person, so I\u2019m being honest with you.\u201dI heaved a sigh in front of Harmonia.Then she managed to smile.\u201cI\u2019m more honored that you think so, Marchioness Hestia.\u201dThat\u2019s it for today.Is this how the farmer\u2019s heart expects to reap how much fruit this seed they sowed will bear?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIt was not immediately clear whether the separation between Diana and Harmonia was successful. I decided to wait with a relaxed mind.And while waiting for the result, a call finally came from Helios.\u201cHe thought about it for a long time. Hmm\u2026.\u201dI laughed cynically as I opened the envelope bearing the crown prince\u2019s seal.The contents of the letter were simple. To enter the palace and see the crown prince. It was not clear exactly how Helios made up his mind.But that\u2019s a pretty good sign. I avoided the worst.There was no reason to hesitate, so I immediately prepared myself and headed to the palace.~~~~\u201cI see the noble little sun of the empire.\u201d\u201cGet up.\u201dSomehow Helios doesn\u2019t ask me to omit the etiquette.It\u2019s a big deal. Have you changed your mind?\u201c\u2026\u201dI raised my head quietly as ordered and waited for Helios\u2019 words in an expressionless manner.Even in the midst of all this, he\u2019s really annoyingly handsome. Black hair with slightly sunken golden eyes. He looks like a sculpture, so it\u2019s at least forgiving.Helios also did not show much emotion on the surface either.\u201cLast time, I had a private meeting with your husband.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt reminded me of him who passed by in the villa at the time. A cold-faced man.Helios asked, raising his chin.\u201cYou\u2019ve heard a rough story from Kaelus, haven\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t hear the details. But I thought you might be struggling with my future.\u201dI answered in a calm tone, looking down.A snortful voice was heard.\u201cWell, you\u2019re quite sensible, though.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dWhat? I thought something changed, but it\u2019s the same. I was worried for no reason.Helios rose from his sitting position. I strolled through the room and opened my mouth.\u201cIn the meantime, you have not delivered many prophecies.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dI\u2019m embarrassed for some reason. It was a countable number of times in one hand, so honestly, I can\u2019t deny it.Still, the ensuing words were quite understandable.\u201cBut each and every one of them was very important enough to determine the fate of this empire. And it was accurate.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dIt\u2019s a good thing to hear, but I calm down myself so that I don\u2019t get excited.In fact, I appreciate that the events before and after regression have not changed much since I don\u2019t really have prophecies.Therefore, this is not a compliment obtained by my own ability.Helios was right in front of me before I knew it.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t help but admit it anyway. I need your ability.\u201d\u201cI appreciate it, your grace.\u201dI kept looking down to avoid eye contact with him.I heard something similar to snorting somewhere.\u201cAren\u2019t you glad, Hestia? In that I can\u2019t help but need you after all.\u201dIt\u2019s a sarcastic tone, but Helios\u2019 feelings were slightly real in it.A sense of defeat and some sort of resignation.I raised my head. And I looked at him with a calm face.\u201cThe reason I\u2019m happy is that I can continue to support you in the future. At the same time, it\u2019s bitter because\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI deliberately trailed the ending of my words. Nevertheless, Helios waited for my words without worrying.When I look at this, I wonder if things have changed a bit. I have no idea. Normally, I would\u2019ve caught something.Anyway, I went on.\u201cYour Highness seems to be at a crossroads of choice, and it is guilty about it seeing it as a servant.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios was just quiet.Of course, unlike as I said, I\u2019m never really sorry for him. Rather, I feel like I want to cheer because my wishes have come true.It\u2019s just a little strange. It\u2019s supposed to be \u00a0 Helios that\u2019s supposed to be annoying. Strangely, however, he is being modest.It can\u2019t be helped. If I want a taste of his true heart, I have to go in first.Let\u2019s ask boldly.\u201cHave you spoken to her bighness, the crown princess?\u201d\u201cBefore that, I will order you as your superior and crown prince of this empire. Tell me everything you talked about with Diana the other day. without a falsehood.\u201dHelios\u2019 voice was like a cool, sharpened blade.But there was more relief than fear. Because everything is going the way I want it to.Alright, Helios. I\u2019d be happy to follow your order. A promise with Diana to keep a secret? To me, that\u2019s lighter than dust flying in the air.I lowered myself as much as I could.\u201cI will faithfully obey your orders. But first, I have to apologize to you.\u201d\u201cApologize?\u201dThe cool gold was distorted for a momentarily.\u201cThe truth is, the prophi that should only be given to the crown prince\u2026\u2026 I have informed her majesty the crown princess.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dA sound of embarrassment and anger at the same time.Before the rebuke poured out, I quickly bowed my head deeply.\u201cThis is the prophecy I told the holy princess. In the next two years, the healing power of her highness is completely gone, your highness the crown prince.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHelios literally hardened like ice. Ah! The joy that spreads through my heart!\u201c\u2026If you\u2019re lying, I\u2019ll blow your head off.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a lie, your grace.\u201dIt\u2019s definitely a threat, but what if I\u2019m not scared at all?I knelt at his feet and fell flat on my face.\u201cHer highness had ordered me to remain silent, saying that she will tell the crown prince herself. How could I, the humble one, violate her majesty\u2019s orders?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cForgive me, Your Grace. Between my responsibilities as an aide and my compassion for her highness, I have put my heart first\u2026.\u201dListen, Helios. I don\u2019t hate Diana. I was rather considerate of Diana\u2019s position!A saint who has lost her healing power, what will happen to her? Helios, you can see it clearly. You want to keep her secret, too. Don\u2019t you?I mean, I\u2019m not a villain. Do you understand?\u201c\u2026Hestia.\u201dAcold but muted tone. I smiled inwardly.\u201cYes, your highness,\u201d\u201cIs that why? The reason why you asked about the condition of the illness.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry., your highness.\u201d\u201cI see. So\u2026.\u201dA giggle of laughter inside. I\u2019m not laughing because it\u2019s funny. I\u2019m laughing because it\u2019s too much to stop.Soon there was a hard voice.\u201cGet up.\u201dI picked myself up carefully.\u201c\u2026.\u201dWithout a word, I waited for Helios\u2019 next words. I laughed inside. There\u2019s nothing special about the original couple who can\u2019t live and die.His way of speaking had become quite plain.\u201c\u2026Diana was not born with healing power from the beginning.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201dThe background of Diana\u2019s healing power in the original work was explained in only one line.As a child, Diana, who witnessed the miserable lives of the poor, prayed hard to God and one day she suddenly became capable. The original novel did not give any reason why only Dianna was given this power.If you insist, isn\u2019t it just because she\u2019s the heroine of the novel?I spoke with a grain of salt.\u201cIt is God\u2019s will to take it back, for it is God\u2019s power. Like a man is born and dies.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios did not answer back.At the same time, I had a lot of thoughts. In a way, I am in the same boat as Diana. One day, I woke up and found myself in a novel. So if I close my eyes one day and open them, I may go back.But Helios\u2019 next words made my heart ache.\u201cThen your prophecies?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHe\u2019s so sharp. I shouldn\u2019t let my guard down until the end.\u201cYes, one day my ability will be like that.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s fair.\u201dNot really. Because I\u2019m not as capable as Diana.I don\u2019t have a superpower. I just know a little more than people in this world.I\u2019m an icebreaker who came into the book and a regressor who went back to the past.So what I lose is not \u2018ability\u2019.It\u2019s life in this world.I asked, looking at his countenance.\u201cWell, your highness, the crown prince. From now on\u2026 What would you do?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dHelios\u2019 sighs revealed a complicated plan.\u201cFirst of all, we\u2019ll have to wait\u2026.\u201dI can\u2019t help but applaud his willingness to trust his beloved wife.Lonesome golden eyes turned to me.\u201cThat day, he used honorifics from beginning to end.\u201dThat day. Is he talking about the time he had a private meeting at the villa?I held back my laughter.\u201cIt\u2019s only natural when he\u2019s out there under orders, your highness.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dHe also muttered resignedly.I looked at him expressionless.That\u2019s how he cut off the old friendship that was left behind. If you wanted to restore your relationship with Kaelus, you made a big mistake, Helios.\u201cI thought it would work out somehow if I faced him again\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI clicked my tongue inside. What a simple thought.Helios turned to me.\u201cI will retain your position as an aide. Keep helping me with that ability.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe this. As long as the prophecy remains, I will accept it like heaven.\u201dThere is always no lie in what I say.I repeated, bending over politely.~~~~On the days I met Helios, I\u2019ve always visited Kaelus and spoke to him.On this day, I visited his room without fail.\u201cI\u2019m back, Kaelus.\u201dKaelus put down the document he was looking at and looked at me.\u201cYou must be tired.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay.\u201dI replied in a light tone.I sat facing him.\u201cTo start, I\u2019m going to keep my job as an aide.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cAnd I told the crown prince that the power of the holy princess would soon disappear. He ordered me not to remain silent.\u201dWell, in fact, I was going to tell him out even if Helios didn\u2019t order it, but it gave me a good excuse. Good for me.\u201cThen there\u2019s nothing we can do.\u201dKaelus replied calmly.I laughed bitterly.\u201cThe crown prince was disappointed. You used honorifics the whole time.\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dThere was also a cynicism around Kaelus\u2019 mouth.Even so, he wouldn\u2019t be very close to Helios. Even though Dianna caused the two to fall apart, it didn\u2019t mean that Helios\u2019 fundamental values or humanity were taken apart.So he just quit being a friend, and the role as Helios\u2019 loyal servant will continue.I don\u2019t want to force \u2018revenge\u2019 on Kaelus.Sometimes it\u2019s too much to even sharpen a knife at someone. At a time when it\u2019s hard to keep your head down.But when I want to sharpen the knife instead, I need to ask him for permission.\u201cWell, Kaelus.\u201d\u201c?\u201dPurple eyes like jewels turned to me.\u201cI have an important prophecy. This is something you must know in advance.\u201dI took a quiet deep breath.\u201cRemember when we predicted a border provocation to the crown prince a few months ago?\u201d\u201cOf course. I thought it was a band of bandits, but it was actually an enemy army.\u201dAs expected, my favorite memory.Anyway, Helios realized the usefulness of my ability and came to meet me as a marquis. That day I asked him for the estate of the dead Duke Orcus and his title.I made a serious face.\u201cThe provocation will not end with that. The second one is more serious than that.\u201d\u201cWhoa.\u201dKaelus\u2019 eyes also changed sharply.\u201cYou have to step up before it goes to war. There\u2019s no one in this empire who can solve it diplomatically besides you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe shut his mouth.When the armed conflict broke out with the neighboring country before the return, the emperor regretted the absence of Kaelus, who had died. Not only the emperor, but also the entire aristocratic society felt the same way.At that time, Helios prevented the war by allowing enemy merchants to do business on imperial territory for free. It was a disappointing result for the empire in many ways.So what about now that Kaelus is alive?\u201cWhat the enemy covets is the economic power of the empire. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re trying to get their merchants into the empire.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been like that for a long time now. They were always envious of the wealth of the empire.\u201dKaelus nodded knowingly.In the past, when he died, everyone said in unison, \u2018If only he were alive.\u2019 Helios, however hard he tried, was not as diplomatic as Kaelus. Though he could never be called incompetent.I snuck out Helios\u2019 answers before returning.\u201cThe enemy will demand free business rights for their merchants in exchange for not going to war.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201dKaelus said flatly.Before regression, I had no choice but to listen to the nonsense. It was because war was already imminent.There were, of course, several signs before that. However, struggling with the aristocratic forces, which became strained by the Diana issue, Helios (the emperor was ill in bed and virtually he acted as emperor) did not catch the signs in time.In the end, the empire had no choice but to negotiate in near humiliation.I tilted my head slightly and asked back.\u201cBut are there any other options besides that? Or should I prepare?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ve dealt with the guys who were snooping around the border the other day, so we probably haven\u2019t got the details yet. It\u2019s enough to show you how to prepare.\u201dKaelus answered firmly.He is right, indeed. Before the return, I knew that the provocation of the border was just a bandit\u2019s act, but I realized it belatedly, but this time, I blocked it with the \u201cprophecy\u201d in advance, so I lost less information and bought time.I smiled at Kaelus.\u201cPlease protect this empire, Kaelus.\u201dSave this country with your own hands. And get a duke title.Then be a huge pillar that no one can replace, and live proudly in front of your betraying old friend and first love.Don\u2019t let this country go without you, and even the great heroes will have to bow to you.I\u2019ll make it for you.You watch.I grabbed Kaelus\u2019 white finger with all my heart.On the raised finger, I kissed it as if I had sworn.\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus looked at me with his hands in his in silence.It\u2019s okay to be relieved.I won\u2019t let go of this hand until the end.~~~~After Helios\u2019 reappointment, some time has passed.One sunny day, I came out to the garden for the first time in a while and opened a pile of letters to me one by one.\u201cIs this from Madam Harmonia\u2026\u2026.\u201dI was also curious about how the work between the two was done, so I opened the envelope with a feeling of excitement.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThere was no mention of an outright confrontation with Diana. However, she did not speak of unconditional trust as before.An expression that is plain and objective and therefore feels rather distant.\u201cWell, that\u2019s not bad.\u201dIt is not easy to suddenly split the two without a special occasion. Maybe it\u2019s better to get a little farther away bit by bit like this.That way, I won\u2019t get caught throwing bait in the middle.I hummed slightly and opened the next letter.\u201cThis time, is it Erinnis\u2026.\u201dIt was not long ago that she complained that it was difficult to get a seat next to Diana. I had told her to take in aristocratic ladies around Diana.Let\u2019s see if it\u2019s going well.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201cAs expected, Erinnis is first in terms of experience. Diana would never do as well as she does.Diana always emphasized \u2018living well\u2019 and \u2018living right\u2019 to the people around her. There was no exception to the children of a close aristocrat.It was always reminded that there are people who do not live in comfort and tranquility without shortage. Along with that, she blamed them for seeing justice and absurdity but not acting immediately.\u201cTsk, this is why you\u2019re stupid, Diana.\u201dShe\u2019s probably thinking that she\u2019s given a very sharp reprimand. And she will praise herself. \u2018I\u2019m doing enough. I\u2019m setting an example by what I\u2019m saying.\u2019Erinnis effectively targeted young ladies who were infinitely intimidated by Diana\u2019s \u2018one-shot.\u2019According to the letter, once she said to the young ladies, \u2018You have done nothing wrong.\u2019 And it was pointed out that Diana was not aware of their world, which she had lived as a commoner all her life.A person is more attracted to warm empathy than to preaching at the top of their head, no matter how good they are psychologically speaking. Erinnis\u2019 strategy was very outstanding in this regard.Of course, Diana sympathized well with the common people\u2019s situation. But that was not the case for the aristocracy.The important thing she\u2019s overlooking is that\u00a0 the aristocratic class is also people who are the same as the commoners who have nothing.I picked up my pen pleasantly and wrote back.\u201cI must admire the skill of the countess\u2026. You\u2019ve captured the souls of the young, and it\u2019s not far off\u2026\u201dWhen Diana came to her senses late, she would have already lost all her aristocratic friends.There is no aristocrat who is afraid of the lonely crown princess. It is not as simple as it sounds to press by taking a picture of yourself. Because I have to deal with the consequences.\u201cWell, is it enough for Diana to have commoners? Maybe she doesn\u2019t care about the aristocracy.\u201dMumbling to myself, I picked up the next letter. Finally, the last one.\u201cOh, Helen sent it!\u201dHelen and Pollux. They are siblings who went to Illion to advertise soap.\u201cWhere\u2026\u201dI wonder if it\u2019s going well. I opened the letter paper quickly with curiosity.The soap prototype that Kaelus and I finally inspected was quickly produced by the craftsman and his apprentices.I didn\u2019t insist on monopolizing the recipe from the marquis. In fact, my wish was the opposite. I hoped that the recipe would spread to as many people as possible if they could use\u00a0 the low-end soap.Regardless of the recipe, the soap was slowly spreading to Illion thanks to the two siblings models. Helen wrote in the letter that the scene and lines of using soap in the play were well received.It\u2019s only a matter of time before soap becomes popular in the Illion estate. At the same time, the incidence of diseases will be greatly reduced. That would also reduce the number of people visiting the temple.And when people move away from the temple, the power of the temple is dampened.\u201cWhat will you do, Diana?\u201dMy voice asking alone naturally reflected joy.How far do we have to hold her down to kneel down? Now that everything is going well, this is what I\u2019m worried about.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayShortly after receiving the letter, another invitation arrived from Countess Erinnis.\u201cThe concert\u2026?\u201dOriginally, various events were often held in the residence of Countess Erinnis. It was because her daughter married early so she had all kinds of parties because she was lonely alone in a big house.Day after day tea, reading, exhibition, etc. I guess it\u2019s time to hold a concert.I\u2019m reading the invitations in a hesitant mood.\u201c!\u201dA short but very powerful phrase stood out.\u201c\u2026If you could accompany your husband\u2026 I\u2019d be more grateful\u2026!\u201dI squeezed my hands without realizing it.Accompanying Kaelus. Kaelus and our first social event as a couple.I should be jumping for joy, but I was terrified.Are you sure it\u2019s gonna be okay? Will Kaelus be able to handle all the eyes of the people?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHonestly, isn\u2019t it obvious? There is no need to think deeply about why Erinnis even mentioned Kaelus while sending me an invitation.It was curiosity. It\u2019s a low level of gossip.A party to a love triangle that has stirred up the public. They\u2019re curious about the recent status of the \u201closer,\u201d who has been out for months under the pretext of illness.Although I\u2019m a political ally of Erinnis, I clearly felt at times like this. That we were never friends.\u201cTsk\u2026.\u201dHowever, there is a reason why I can\u2019t ignore this invitation even if I\u2019m upset.It\u2019s not just because of political meaning. No other than that, it\u2019s because I can\u2019t predict Kaelus\u2019 intentions on my own.To be honest, Kaelus\u2019 condition has not fully recovered. Even so, it was not possible to immediately block Kaelus\u2019 outside activities from the inside.At the very least, it\u2019s right to ask him for a doctor and add my opinion that he should take more rest instead of going out.\u201cPhew, I\u2019m going to go ask.\u201dI shook off my seat and stood up. Holding Erinnis\u2019 invitation tightly in my hand, I went to Kaelus\u2019 room.~~~~\u201cKaelus.\u201dI knocked lightly at the slightly open study door.The servant in the room quickly identified me and went inside, it seems, to inform Kaelus.\u201cCome on in.\u201dI could hear his voice. The servant walked up and opened the door wide. I nodded my head slightly and thanked him and went inside.Various newspapers, books, and thick bundles of documents were scattered on the desk in the study. He must have faithfully accepted my prophecy that there would be a threat of war and was studying countermeasures.I felt truly sorry.\u201cI\u2019ve interrupted your busy schedule. I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cNo, I was just about to cool my head.\u201dHow can he respond so easily? I was moved by Kaelus\u2019 consideration.He closed his eyes and pressed his hand against them and said, \u201cMy eyes are tired because I\u2019ve read so many letters.\u201d\u201cWell, you should get your glasses fitted. That would be a lot easier.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s not bad.\u201dI should ask Uross to recruit a good optician.\u201cBut what\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s not a big deal\u2026.\u201dI opened my mouth fiddling with the invitation.\u201cCountess Erinnis is inviting musicians to a concert. She asked if you could come with me\u2026.\u201dNow that I\u2019ve said it, I\u2019m so embarrassed. It\u2019s like asking him out!\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus looked at me expressionless. I spoke quickly to gain momentum.\u201cWell, that doesn\u2019t mean you have to go. I know you\u2019re sick, but the countess is inviting us like this because she\u2019s curious. It\u2019s actually not worth thinking about. I asked you first, so I\u2019ll write a polite reply to decline.\u201dI spouted like a loaded gun and quickly stepped back.Then.\u201cThat\u2019s not bad, either.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dFor a moment I thought I heard something wrong. I mean, what\u2019s not bad?\u201cWhat?\u201dWhen I asked again, I got an answer in a businesslike tone.\u201cThe concert. I mean, it\u2019s okay to go.\u201d\u201c!\u201dWithout hesitation, my mouth opened wide.\u201cWhy are you going?\u201d\u201cYou asked. Can I go with you?\u201d\u201cOh, so I mean\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026.\u201dWow, seriously, how could I stutter so stupidly! All I am now is a babbling fool!Kaelus folded his arms while fixing his posture.\u201cWhy are you so flustered?\u201d\u201cBecause I didn\u2019t know you\u2019d say you\u2019d really go!\u201dI answered almost screaming. Then, I caught my breath for a while, calmed down my breath, and continued talking.\u201cYou know why she called you. I\u2019m just asking you in a formal way because I can see that you\u2019re just trying to fill in the low interest, but I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s presumptuous to throw it out.\u201dI added earnestly at the end.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t want you to go.\u201dBut Kaelus responded with the same tone all the time.\u201cI know, but I don\u2019t think we should hide and avoid like this forever.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to deal with it now. After a little while, after a full recovery\u2026\u201dHe shook his head at my words.\u201cI can\u2019t afford it. I have to step up for foreign negotiations soon, and as long as I stay locked up until then, no one will believe my mental state.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dAh! The prophecy who told me beforehand made this kind of boomerang. If I knew this would happen, I would have told you a few days later!Kaelus waved his hand.\u201cI\u2019m done talking. Tell the countess I\u2019ll be with you. When is the concert?\u201d\u201cA week\u2026later\u2026.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s enough. I see.\u201dHe pulled his chair back down in front of his desk. It was a silent sign of the end of the conversation.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI was forced to step down.And I came back to my room with a rather absentminded mind.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dA strange groan came out of my mouth.\u201cI\u2019m going crazy\u2026.\u201dI really didn\u2019t expect him to accept the invitation. Of course! Who in the world would volunteer to go up to the stage of that vulgar show!Lying on the bed, I stared vacantly up at the ceiling. Soon there was a great sigh.\u201cHaaaaaaa\u2026\u201dApproximately twenty people attend the concert. The proportion of men and women is not exactly even, but it will be about fifty-fifty.It\u2019s not a lot, but it\u2019s not a small scale, and since it\u2019s the guests that Countess Erinnis has chosen and invited herself, the weight of society must be considerable.If Kaelus appeared there.\u201cUh\u2026.\u201dI don\u2019t even want to imagine it.Gossip-excited eyes will always follow Kaelus. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll catch every breath he takes. At the same time, they will have all kinds of stories in their heads. What does that sigh mean? What\u2019s wrong with his eyes? It\u2019s obvious that useless speculation will stick to every little gesture.Why did Kaelus call such a position \u201cnot bad\u201d?\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dI can only sigh one after another.I can\u2019t even take his doctor with me. Otherwise, Kaelus\u2019 intention to prove that he has recovered will be for naught.I can\u2019t do it. I have to follow him around and take care of him. He might be a little annoyed, but people who suffer from panic disorder can have a seizure at any moment. It\u2019s much better for me to follow him in a more aggressive way than for him\u00a0 to collapse suddenly.I lifted myself up from the bed. And with reluctance, I picked up my pen.\u201cWith my husband\u2026 I\u2019ll see you\u2026.\u201dI can see the expression of Erinis who received the reply. I\u2019m getting angry. It\u2019s a suggestion she just threw at me, but it\u2019s kind of annoying to bite me like this.If I knew this would happen, I\u2019d just say I\u2019m going alone. I thought Kaelus could make the least rational judgment. Of course, I expected you to answer me to go alone. That\u2019s why I thought it\u2019d be nice to ask.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dI kept swearing in my mouth.It\u2019s not that Kaelus doesn\u2019t understand the rationale for accepting the invitation. As he said, it is necessary to show that he is really in good shape to undertake diplomatic negotiations with the fate of the country.But there\u2019s no reason why it should be such an awkward outing with a married couple. Shouldn\u2019t he just say, \u201cI\u2019ll meet the emperor again and deal with state affairs?\u201d\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know..\u201dI closed my eyes tightly. The more I think about it, the more I don\u2019t know what\u2019s inside of Kaelus.It has already been done anyway. Calm down and get ready for the next one.I tried to calm down and called the maid. The maid, who was doing petty work, quickly understood and moved.Soon Clarice came to the room.\u201cDid you call, ma\u2019am?\u201d\u201cYes, I have to go to Countess Erinnis\u2019 concert in a week. With Kaelus.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dI shook my head as I looked at her in disbelief and admiration.\u201cSo please prepare clothes for couples to wear together. I think the maid knows better about this than I do.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Leave it to me.\u201dClarice replied with a jubilant look.Oh, don\u2019t get me wrong. This isn\u2019t a couple\u2019s cozy date.However, I gave up explaining everything. Because I don\u2019t have any mental strength left.\u201c\u2026please.\u201dI only responded with a weak voice.~~~~It was a not so secret secret that the marquis and his wife will attend the concert of Erinnis quickly spread.My head throbbed at the incessant letter.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m a big mouth.\u201dErinnis must have been talking again after receiving a reply. She\u2019s quite a mouthful to her close friends.I don\u2019t know who the musician to play is, but I got it right this time. Now that it\u2019s become the most boisterous concert in society.Meanwhile, Clarice called out again the tailor, Tekima, who had reformed my dress before. I ordered my existing suit to be fixed in line with Kaelus\u2019s robes.Tekima asked in a confident voice.\u201cWhat kind of atmosphere do you want, marchioness? It\u2019s the newlyweds\u2019 first social outing, so being young and lively would suit you.\u201d\u201cNo, I want a calm and intelligent atmosphere.\u201dI shook my head in disgust. Tekima replied regretfully.\u201cBut it looks good enough over time. There are things that you can\u2019t do if you don\u2019t do it now\u2026\u201dClarice responded to his remarks.\u201cSir Tekima is right. Ma\u2019am, isn\u2019t it time to dress up boldly? You can\u2019t do it when you\u2019re older.\u201d\u201cBut look at the suits that Kaelus has.\u201dI tried not to raise my voice.\u201cThe style he prefers is generally calm. If you want to dress him up as you want, you\u2019ll have to make a new suit for him.\u201dBut Tekima rarely gave up.\u201cThen I\u2019ll make the marquis\u2019 clothes all at once. If I stay up for a few nights, two suits are easy!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. The concert is less than a week away.\u201dI dismissed it immediately.After a moment\u2019s hesitation, Tekima began to persistently assert himself again.\u201cThen I\u2019ll try to mend the clothes I have. If you\u2019re really nervous, I\u2019ll make a pair as the marchioness wants, and with the atmosphere of a young couple that I come up with. What do you think?\u201d\u201cCan you make it in time? I don\u2019t think I can concentrate on one thing.\u201dDespite my sullen response, Tekima nodded loudly.\u201cI\u2019ll show you something that you\u2019ll be satisfied with. Don\u2019t worry, marchioness.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s strange to be so boastful. Still, I acknowledged his ability, so I reluctantly answered yes.\u201cAll right, Tekima. Don\u2019t let me down.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you! Marchioness!\u201dTekima bowed deeply over and over again.I shook my head in a jaded mood. Ugh, just try whatever you want. If I don\u2019t like it, I won\u2019t call you next time.~~~~That day, I had dinner with Kaelus and told him about the day.\u201cThe tailor made an unexpected suggestion. Let\u2019s make a different style of dress.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dKaelus, without much agitation, only raised and lowered his eyebrows.Somehow I was embarrassed to make a fuss, so I continued in a calm tone.\u201cYes, he said it would be perfect to wear at this time, and she said, \u2018How about a young and lively atmosphere like a newlywed couple?\u2019 \u201d\u201cAha.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t feel like it, so he said he\u2019ll make two. One in a calm style, two for you as he suggested.\u201d\u201cWill it be possible within the deadline?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know. But the tailor says he\u2019s confident.\u201d\u201cThen I have no choice but to believe it.\u201d\u201cI know.\u201dA conversation that is so ordinary. Words that leave behind private life, not public affairs.I suddenly felt strange. It really felt like we were a married couple.We pretend to be a couple based on the contract, yet we can have such a small talk and such a long conversation.\u201c\u2026\u201dI was speechless at the sudden unfamiliarity.\u201c\u2026Hess?\u201dA sudden call.My favorite\u2019s voice awakened me.I smiled quickly.\u201cOh, nothing. I was thinking about something for a second.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m curious. Can you tell me?\u201dKaelus asked, tilting his head slightly. A dry tone of speech with no sign of any particular interest.I laughed awkwardly.\u201cJust, it was so natural that I felt strange for a moment.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dWhat a strange explanation. But I can\u2019t think of a clear expression.Kaelus looked at me quietly.\u201cIt\u2019s strange, La*\u2026.\u201d*TN: he trails off here so we don\u2019t know what he was going to say\u201cOh\u2026\u201dDid I sound upset? I added hastily.\u201cI mean, thank you for being so nice to me even though the topic is so trivial.\u201dHe opened his mouth with his eyes fixed on me.\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, it\u2019s insignificant.\u201dSomehow my heart heated up. It must be because of those pretty purple eyes.\u201cWell, let\u2019s go\u2026?\u201dMy gaze went down by itself. Even my face was burning.After a pause, his calm voice was heard.\u201c\u2026It\u2019s a matter of dress for social gatherings, of course it\u2019s important.\u201dOh, yeah. That\u2019s right. I almost forgot.Kaelus is right. Isn\u2019t his attendance at the concert aimed at promoting his health? From head to toe, no rough patch is allowed.The hot heart sank. I raised my face again.\u201cCome to think of it, it is.\u201dKaelus nodded quietly.\u201cI want you to tell the tailor that I\u2019m looking forward to the work, too.\u201d\u201cI will. He might burst on the spot.\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dThe air at the table remained calm until the end of the meal.~~~~It\u2019s due.Because Tekima even made a suit for Kaelus, Kaelus was also present to check the results.I was rather nervous. It was because it was the first time for us as a couple to greet outsiders side by side. Of course, there were a few times in front of Helios, but it was just passing by.I hope Tekima has created a fantastic work. Wouldn\u2019t it be a big deal if Kaelus got angry?Soon butler Uross told me the tailor arrived. Kaelus and I headed to the drawing room where Tekima was waiting.Tekima, who has a generous body, greeted him by wiping his forehead with a handkerchief.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to meet the marquis, who is famous.\u201d\u201cAre you the tailor? You managed to meet the date.\u201dKaelus responded with a dry tone that didn\u2019t hold much emotion.I checked the dress I ordered immediately.\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI honestly, genuinely admired it. It\u2019s really well made.First, the calm and intelligent concept that I wanted. The dress was based on dark purple and navy to avoid being too heavy, and the beads were densely embedded with elegant curves.Next, the bright suit set that Tekima suggested. White background was used for men\u2019s and women\u2019s clothes, and crystals and colors were tactfully mixed. The crystal jewelry decoration, which varies in color subtly depending on the angle of view, was also very impressive.I didn\u2019t expect much, but it was a result that I had to admit that it was genuinely pretty. Somehow I felt awkward.\u201cWell, you did a great job, Tekima.\u201dI tried not to show off my excitement and praised him with a gentle gesture.Tekima, who was very nervous, also looked relieved.\u201cI promised I\u2019d never let you down, marchioness.\u201dI glanced back at Kaelus.\u201cHow about you?\u201dKaelus also affirmed with his unique expressionless face.\u201cYou\u2019re good. Both are fine.\u201dOh, thankfully, he successfully satisfied Kaelus too. It\u2019s more amazing than it looks. It\u2019s Tekima.Tekima also smiled as if he had crossed a big mountain.\u201cThank you, marquis!\u201dKaelus rose slowly from his seat. I think he\u2019ll go back to his room now that he\u2019s done with his business.\u201cI\u2019ll ask for you again next time. Good job.\u201d\u201cThank you!\u201dLeaving behind the jubilant tailor, I also left the drawing room with Kaelus.~~~~All that was left was to decide which way to wear to the concert.Honestly, I liked both of them, so it was hard to decide at once.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dI put two pairs of clothes side by side on the mannequin and agonized for a long time.Then there was a small knock, and Clarice, the maid, came in with a coffee kettle.\u201cMadam, I brought you a drink.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dClarice said as she put the tray down.\u201cI guess you haven\u2019t decided yet. The concert is tomorrow.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026.\u201dI bowed my head. Alas, what should I do with this decision-making obstacle?\u201cYou\u2019re worried because you like both, right?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026.\u201dI murmured and replied, but instead, a laugh was what I got in return.\u201cThen how about choosing this white dress? If you don\u2019t mind, it\u2019s good to try something bold sometimes.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a big party for the royal family, it\u2019s a small concert, so it\u2019ll be less burdensome. Now is the opportunity.\u201dIt was increasingly plausible to hear what Clarice said. I asked for a definite answer in a slightly unsure voice.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be okay, right? Kaelus has never had this kind of vibe before\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, it looks good on you. Whatever you wear, you\u2019ll look great, madam.\u201dOh, that sure answer.Yes, Clarice is right a hundred times. My favorite would look like a prince even with a rag!\u201cOkay, then I\u2019ll choose this one.\u201dShe smiled and walked away with an empty tray.I took a deep breath and looked at the white dress set in front of me.\u201cPhew, that\u2019s good. Like a young newlywed couple\u2026!\u201dI sincerely hope that other people will accept it like that.~~~~Finally the day to go out with Kaelus.While preparing diligently, his doctor came to me and gave me some medicine bottles.\u201cIf the master has a seizure, use it, madam.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dMy expression seemed rather worried, so he smiled softly.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry too much. He\u2019s really recovered a lot. It\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like in the house. You never know what\u2019s going to happen out there.\u201d\u201cWell, I mean, you\u2019re with the master, so nothing will happen. Hehe\u2026.\u201dI don\u2019t want to hear anything that makes me feel relieved. I sent him out with a rough answer.Soon the maids clung together, smoothed our hair, and began to put cosmetics on their faces.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs I closed my eyes still, I wondered what Kaelus was doing.\u201cKaelus, are you getting ready?\u201d\u201cYes, I think you\u2019ll finish sooner.\u201dI guess so. I tried to keep my composure by exhaling quietly.An indescribable tension.I didn\u2019t know going to a social gathering with Kaelus would be so nerve-wracking. It was a lot worse than I thought.I was determined to go to an outside event with him someday. Nevertheless.\u201c\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s be honest. The reason I\u2019m nervous is not because I\u2019m entirely worried about Kaelus.I care about him.I\u2019m afraid of what Kaelus will think of me when he sees me having a 'social life.\u201dPretending to be noble, pretending to be dignified, but hiding malice and shrewd tricks behind it, and dressing up as a pretense.I\u2019m afraid my favorite will see through.From now on, I must shamelessly act as a cultured lady at the gathering of Countess Erinnis and her friends. In front of Kaelus, who lives with me.\u201c\u2026\u201dI\u2019m ashamed. I\u2019m ashamed enough to die.I don\u2019t show any sincerity, but I\u2019m smiling brightly and chatting.How beautiful for my favorite to see. How insignificant of a human being I would seem to him.It will be revealed in every detail in the eyes of my favorite.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dMy heart feels heavy.In the world of this novel, my actions are extremely dual and full of malice.Taking the opportunity of Kaelus being locked up in the house, did I not engage in too many conspiracies and tricks?My not good self. Kaelus is about to witness this reality of me in public.I want to hide in a rat hole.Yes, this is what I really mean. The true heart of me ripping Kaelus off. Wanting to hide my trifling kernel.\u201cMadam, it\u2019s done.\u201d\u201c\u2026good work. Thank you.\u201dNo matter how much fancy makeup you put on.You can\u2019t hide a real dark face.**TN: as in her warped personality~~~~I even changed my dress, and I\u2019m perfectly ready to go out.I came out into the hallway. On the other side, Kaelus was coming out of the room.Despite the subdued mood, I smiled without realizing it.\u201cYou\u2019re so cool, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cYou, too.\u201dA short answer, but that was enough.The maid was right. My favorite looks good in any clothes.It was always a serious and sober image of Kaelus. However, such bright-colored suits also look good without any awkwardness. Long silver hair, which is slightly sparsely braided, also plays a part in this atmosphere.\u201cShall we go?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA bare hand without gloves leaned out in front of me.I hesitated for a moment. Can I reach it?Kaelus is different from me. A man of consistency in appearance. It\u2019s a long way from me with a dark core.But you shouldn\u2019t feel awkward. Outside this house, we\u2019re a couple.I snuck my breath and put my hand on his. I felt warmth over the white lace gloves.\u201c\u2026\u201dI rather appreciate the indifferently wrapped touch.~~~~It was not long before we could reach the house of Countess Erinnis. We arrived a little earlier than the appointed time.\u201cMarquis Kaelus! Marchioness Hestia!\u201dWe were just getting out of the carriage door when the countess greeted us in a higher voice than usual.Kaelus responded in a calm tone.\u201cThank you for inviting me, countess.\u201d\u201cOh, I should be thankful! Thanks to you, the concert became a hot topic\u2026.\u201dErinnis did not hide her excitement but did not lose her dignity. A woman who is very good at acting.I said with a jealous smile.\u201cWe came a little early just in case it was crowded, but I don\u2019t know if it was rude.\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t mention it. Marchioness, I\u2019m rather pleased.\u201dThe countess guided us to a small hall. The piano and cello were placed, so it seemed to be holding the concert here.There were already a lot of guests in the hall even though they came early because it was so famous. As soon as we entered, all eyes were on us.\u201cAh\u2026 You\u2019re all here.\u201dWhen I spoke in a slightly bored voice, Erinnis replied with a gentle smile.\u201cWhoa, I know.\u201dOur seat was at the same table as the host. Which means we\u2019re the most honored guest among today\u2019s guests.Despite the concentrated gaze, no one approached willingly, perhaps because of the peculiar coldness that Kaelus breathed out. I\u2019m rather be glad. It\u2019ll be less annoying.In fact, I had a hard time just walking as if nothing happened. I felt breathless pressure everywhere.\u201c\u2026\u201dErinnis\u2019 butler came and quietly put the tea set down on the table. Of course, Erinnis knows that I prefer coffee, but it didn\u2019t suit these gatherings because it could allude to when we met.As the butler tried to pour the tea, Kaelus waved his hand and stopped him. I tried to pull my stiffening face into a smile.I heard a low voice.\u201cYou look very nervous, Hess.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI admitted without reserve.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s my first time out with you.\u201dI answered in a whisper so as not to be heard by others. To the point where Kaelus had to tilt his head slightly towards me.He nodded slightly. Then he calmly lifted the teapot.\u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a situation where we can ask for coffee.\u201dThankfully, I dropped the teapot by myself. In a place with so many eyes, without hesitation. In the same manner as I used to do at home.Many people who have watched this scene will soon be excited. Did you see that? The marquis are much closer than we thought!I clenched a warm cup. A ripple broke out in the glass.\u201c\u2026.\u201dMy heart suddenly became cold.In this world, I was an extra named \u201cHestia.\u201d Not really myself, but a novel character.Was it who I am at home? No, it\u2019s not. From the name to the identity, it was all the \u201cHestia\u201d that I possessed. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m depressed by my double-faced self. It\u2019s not even funny.Every moment of breathing and living here is acting. As a fictional extra, Hestia. Even the Kaelus, who holds out a teacup for me, doesn\u2019t know the real me outside the book.So.Don\u2019t be mistaken.This is not a reality.\u201c\u2026The tea you make is as delicious as coffee.\u201dThe hardened face slowly loosened.Yes, I can do the same as the marquis. There\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of just by pretending. I\u2019m just pretending in the world anyway. Pretending to be Hestia from a commoner. Pretending to be a prophet.\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dKaelus lifted only one lip slightly, with a gesture of arrogance. A gesture of pointing out the obvious.I laughed after him.Let\u2019s not forget my purpose. Let\u2019s just stick to it.Why should I be ashamed of Kaelus? As long as he\u2019s happy, everything\u2019s okay if he messes up my face.~~~~The cellist invited by the Countess played a typical aristocratic style. A familiar style that is not very unconventional.With the appearance of Kaelus, everyone\u2019s mind is in the gutter, even the performance is like that, so how can we appreciate it properly? Before I knew it, the cellist\u2019s performance became background music.Erinnis spoke cautiously and friendly.\u201cMarquis, have you recovered?\u201d\u201cYes, I feel much better.\u201dKaelus answered briefly but without disrespect.I opened my mouth with a smile on my face.\u201cThank you very much for giving me a comfortable seat, countess.\u201d\u201cWhoa, it\u2019s worth the courage. I really didn\u2019t expect the couple to come together.\u201dShe gave Kaelus a slight look, and then lowered her voice.\u201cBut I\u2019ve heard an interesting story lately, Hestia.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cYour majesty is in bed. And for quite a few days.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHas it been revealed?It was a secret among secrets that the emperor had fallen ill. The fact that only a few in the palace, including myself, know.At that time, Diana immediately exercised her healing power, avoiding an emergency. However, even though she continued to pour out her power since then, the emperor could not easily get better. I dug into this very point and worked to crack between the crown prince and his wife.I raised my eyebrows as if I hadn\u2019t heard it before.\u201cNo way. Her highness is here. She will always exercise God\u2019s power.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.\u201dErinnis took another glimpse of Kaelus and then went on.\u201c\u2026Something must have gone wrong with the saint.\u201d\u201c!\u201dOh, after all, you got caught. Diana.I quickly covered my lips with my hand. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll get caught smiling.\u201cSomething\u2019s wrong?\u201dErinnis nodded silently, and without further explanation, she bit her lips.Oh, no. Do you want to see me fretting over curiosity? That\u2019s absurd.Well, that\u2019s good. You have to keep up with the beat.\u201cAh, Countess\u2026!\u201d\u201cHo-ho, I\u2019m in trouble here, so I\u2019ll tell you later, Hestia.\u201dShe laughed with great delight.Kaelus suddenly looked back at us in wonder. I snuggled up to him and whispered low.\u201cHis majesty\u2019s condition must have leaked out.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHis face was expressionless and his eyes slightly lowered his eyes slightly. A sign that he understood me.The three of us on the table shared a \u2018secret\u2019 by exchanging meaningful eyes with each other. Well, Kaelus and I already knew this.In any case, Erinnis told us about the health of the emperor and the issue of the power of the saint, which is an important matter of the country, and it was intended to empower me, who is on the line of confrontation with Diana. At the same time, suggesting that she could also be Diana\u2019s enemy at any time.Kaelus asked Erinnis in a rather crooked tone.\u201cI thought you wanted to be friends with the crown princess.\u201d\u201cWhoa, I can\u2019t help it because she rarely gives me the time of day.\u201dErinnis made a very graceful excuse.Her words reawakened the harshness of society. The fact that if you don\u2019t accept someone as a friend, you may soon meet them as enemies.My relationship with Erinnis is not strictly a friend. But it\u2019s a political ally with the same purpose. It\u2019s extremely profitable, but it\u2019s rather comfortable because the range of trust is clear.I slipped out of thoughts.\u201cBut you\u2019re probably doing well with the young ladies, right?\u201cOh, of course. Thanks to the marchioness\u2019 advice, I\u2019m having a lot of fun these days.\u201dShe continued in a laughing tone.\u201cThere are many people who are impressed by the marchioness\u2019 moral principles. They asked me to introduce them to the marchioness.\u201d\u201cOh, my God. Not to that extent\u2026.\u201dThen, Kaelus, who was listening to the conversation, casually snapped.\u201cThe teachings of the temple are not very pleasant to hear.\u201dSimple but powerful truth. There is no human being in this world who likes bitter sounds.Advice based on affection for the other person does not sound sweet to the other person\u2019s ears. In addition, what is the point of pointing it out with Diana\u2019s authority? At a time when even that authority is in fact faltering.But apart from the content, I looked at Kaelus with an anxious heart. It was because he had an evaluation of Crown Princess Diana.Erinnis seemed surprised, too. No wonder, Kaelus loved the saintess so passionately that the whole world knew it.But the purple eyes were as dry as ever.\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe didn\u2019t say anything more.~~~~Fortunately, Kaelus remained stable throughout the concert. Sometimes, the curious eyes of those who greeted them were also easily accepted.But I asked just in case.\u201cDo you feel stuffy? How about your breathing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. It\u2019s bearable.\u201dA reply that came back peacefully. But soon enough.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m a little tired.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI was relieved inside. He didn\u2019t force himself to pretend to be okay and told me the truth.I looked around quickly. The concert was just over and now we were gathering in groups of\u00a0 twos and threes to chat.\u201cLet\u2019s go back, Kaelus.\u201dTo be honest, the timing is not good. How much they will talk about the marquis after we disappear?But nothing is more important to me than my favorite\u2019s state. Chew out or bite as much as you want. Kaelus is tired, so we have to go home quickly!I looked for the host as calmly as I could so that I didn\u2019t seem to be in a hurry.\u201cCountess.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re about to leave.\u201d\u201cYes, I think so.\u201dLet\u2019s see. She quickly notices and speaks first without a long explanation. Thanks to that, I could say goodbye comfortably.She quietly escorted us out of the hall so as not to spoil the party.\u201cThank you again. Thanks to you, the concert was very successful.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll see you again when I get the chance, Countess Erinnis.\u201dWith a polite reply, we got into the carriage that had just arrived at the front door.Little by little, we moved away from Erinnis\u2019 mansion.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dA sigh of relief broke out on its own. I heard Kaelus snorting softly next to me.\u201cHuh, are you that relieved?\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 Actually, I don\u2019t hate meeting people, but I\u2019m not that comfortable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s likely. Especially in society, you can\u2019t just enjoy it.\u201dHe nodded understandably.I felt awkward and touched my forehead with my fingers.\u201cAnyway, luxurious people will love it. Because it\u2019s been a long time since you\u2019ve been outside.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think I caused any trouble today.\u201d\u201cJust showing up is enough. That\u2019s how big your presence is.\u201dThen he smiled bitterly.\u201cWell, if you\u2019re a piece of gossip.\u201d\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus was more cold to himself than anyone else.He must have been so afraid because he already knew what the world would look like, but he endured it resolutely in front of these many eyes today.I really want to hold your hand. I want to compliment you for doing a great job. I want to say thank you for hanging in there. I want to warm his heart, which must have been lonely after losing Diana.I managed to smile as I suppressed my choking heart.\u201cYou did a great job, Kaelus.\u201dThe cold purple eyes stared at me.\u201cYou, too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 22": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIndeed, the response was tremendous. When Kaelus overcame his illness and showed his robustness, he was sent letters from all over.I asked the butler who brought the coffee.\u201cAt the letters arriving in front of Kaelus as much as it comes to me?\u201d\u201cYes, but her barely reads it, and he just lets it\u00a0 pile up.\u201d\u201cPhew, I thought so.\u201dBut he should at least send a reply. If not all.Uross said, reading my darkened expression.\u201cIf Hestia is willing to take care of it, I\u2019ll ask Kael.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s better to do that, right?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re just grateful for the relief.\u201dUross\u2019 countenance was much brighter.After he left, I sighed again.\u201cHa\u2026 It\u2019s a disaster. A complete disaster\u2026.\u201dSitting down and earning work, is this not a disaster that has been brought on by myself?But if he can be comfortable as much as I suffer, I can take on even more.I sat down in front of the desk with coffee. And I tore through piles of letters in the basket.\u201c\u2026\u201dA rush of reality. Damn it.Who said that noble women live gracefully and leisurely? It\u2019s not easy to relax. My eyes are going to fall out.But complaining doesn\u2019t solve anything. I exhaled a long breath, and then determinedly opened the letters one by one.When you\u2019re behind in your work, you have to deal with the important thing first. Fortunately, the competent butler Uross tied these letters separately.\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dThis certainly makes me feel comfortable.I looked first at the report sent by the official of the Illion estate. It was a special request for a separate investigation.\u201cLet\u2019s see if the number of visitors to the temple have changed.\u201dThanks to Helen and Pollux\u2019s sibling enthusiastic advertising, the soap quickly spread throughout Illion. Since most of the production cost was covered by the my finances, the price was also very low.Kaelus\u2019 idea that even if it costs more, the scent must be added was also right. The commoners of Illion imitated the life of the venerable aristocracy by using their own fragrant soap.The use of soap was steadily increasing, and it\u2019s about time for the effect to come into play.\u201cOh, oh\u2026.\u201dFor a little over a month, the number of visitors to the temple were gradually decreasing. If the temple was not careful checking these changes, it was highly likely that it will still not be noticed.I laughed with satisfaction. It couldn\u2019t be better.It\u2019s much better to dry up like this than to stand out. It\u2019s like a frog that doesn\u2019t even know it\u2019s cooking in boiling water.\u201cShall we start a campaign to drink boiled water?\u201dIf you want to tighten your leash, you have to do it until they\u2019re out of breath. Otherwise, they\u2019ll jump at you as soon as they can breathe.I took up my pen and wrote back to the official in Illion. I read in an academic journal that it\u2019s better to drink hot water after cooling it down than just drinking cold water. Therefore, inform the people of the land to drink water after cooling it as much as possible.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dSince it\u2019s a tea-drinking culture, I don\u2019t have to say it. But there\u2019s no harm in telling him, so let\u2019s use it for now.While I was in the midst of moving my pen, Uross, who had gone to Kaelus, returned.\u201cKaelus has given us permission. From now on, he said that you can read the letters to master and sort them out.\u201d\u201cOh, yeah. Alright.\u201dWork increased, but a corner of the heart warmed up.Kaelus is trusting me. It gives me a lot of feelings. Wasn\u2019t he supposed to work alone?\u201cPlease say thank you, Uross.\u201d\u201cYes, Lady Hestia.\u201dA master who trusts me, and a faithful butler.Perfect. I\u2019ll never fail.~~~~After that day, it was mostly up to me to answer the invitations flying to Kaelus.The contents of the reply were all the same. \u2018Thank you for the invitation, but I\u2019ll see you next time.\u2019The seemingly important invitations were checked directly with Kaelus. But his answer was the same.\u201cI refuse everything.\u201dThere was also a letter inviting us as a couple once, but there were a lot of things that I didn\u2019t feel the need to attend.After all, Kaelus never went into society again after Countess Erinnis\u2019 concert. I don\u2019t even know when my next outing will be.Nevertheless, the society has been talking about Kaelus every day.~~~~\u201cMarchioness Hestia! Even if you didn\u2019t come, I waited with my neck out to see when you would come.\u201dWhen I stopped by the salon after a long time, Madame Harmonia was very pleased.I replied with a big smile.\u201cI was so busy that I was out of my mind. I really wanted to meet you, too. Harmonia.\u201dWhen I showed up, there was a stir in the salon. I\u2019m having difficulty swallowing for some reason. I feel like I\u2019ve become a star. This is all thanks to my favorite.Harmonia quickly noticed the air.\u201cIt must be a little noisy here.\u201dShe guided me to the pre-arranged separate room. There seems to be something else you want to tell me.At first, I thought she\u2019d ask how Kaelus was doing, but judging from her appearance, it seems to be more serious than that.\u201cMadam, what\u2019s going on?\u201dSure enough, Harmonia sighed and smiled awkwardly.\u201cAs expected, the Marquis\u2019 wife can\u2019t be beaten.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you? Is the crown princess the problem again?\u201dI made a bold stab at it. Then a series of sighs broke out from her.\u201cRather than a problem\u2026\u2026 She doesn\u2019t have anyone to get any helpful advice from.\u201dI burst out laughing. There were a lot of people who could help, but how many of them did Diana beat?\u201cOh, my God, madam. There are not many people who can withstand the royal courtesies. Besides, she prefers to respond to advice.\u201dI pointed out quite acrimoniously. Harmonia was also weakly positive.\u201cThat\u2019s true, but I can\u2019t leave her like this.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the use of forcing a wise woman to come to you when she doesn\u2019t want to?\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a good woman by nature. She just doesn\u2019t know the ropes.\u201dI\u2019m frustrated. Should I say goodbye to Harmonia? I can\u2019t afford to lose to Diana.However, unexpected words continued.\u201cMarchioness, help me.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI\u2019ve never heard anything more ridiculous.\u201cHarmonia. I\u2019m the one the crown princess is most wary of. Besides, I already did madam\u2019s favor last time. You still have that debt, did you forget?\u201d\u201cI know. Lady Marquis. But there\u2019s really no one but you.\u201dHarmonia said desperately. But I shook my head.\u201cHow many famous adults in society do you say that to? And the crown princess would hate me to approach her as an advisor.\u201d\u201cHestia is also an aide to the crown prince. If you are concerned about the coldness of Her Majesty Diana, I have an idea.\u201dOh, you have an idea? Let\u2019s hear it.\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201cYou can sit down with the young people they\u2019re close to.\u201dOh, my God. I shouldn\u2019t have heard her out. This is ridiculous.\u201cIs that madam\u2019s plan? Just listen to that. What would happen if you put me in a place full of the Crown Prince\u2019s allies? I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll bite me off thinking they\u2019re right.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m sure they won\u2019t.\u201d\u201c?\u201dHer answer was so convincing that I wondered. Harmonia once again stressed.\u201cThere will never be a chance for the young to antagonize or look down on the marchioness. I guarantee you.\u201d\u201cIs it a well-founded guarantee?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201dHarmonia closed her eyes gently and opened them.\u201cAt some point, the young ladies began to stay away from Her Highness Diana. Right now, there\u2019s no one around her who can call her a close friend.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dTo be honest, it\u2019s not surprising. I told Countess Erinnis to take in Diana\u2019s friends.However, even if we didn\u2019t plan it, it was time to get tired of Diana\u2019s inconsiderate justice one by one. It\u2019s Diana\u2019s fault for thinking everyone would like it if she said the right thing.Harmonia calmly persuaded me.\u201cYoung ladies would rather listen to the marchioness. If Diana\u2019s close friends come out like that, she won\u2019t be able to throw out the Marquis\u2019 wife.\u201d\u201cYou know the personality of the crown princess. No matter what people say, she\u2019s not the kind of person who can break her stubbornness, Harmonia.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s going to be different this time. I\u2019m telling you.\u201dI stared at her. You\u2019re that sure? Really?She added with a big nod.\u201cTrust me. If you want proof, I\u2019ll be happy to show you.\u201d\u201cHow will you prove it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell the crown princess to send an invitation to the marchioness for tea time. Young ladies, who are close to her, including me, will attend the event.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cAt first, you don\u2019t have to give advice, just relax and chat. Hestia will be good at understanding the atmosphere of the participants, even if I don\u2019t bother to tell you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI\u2019m a little moved. So I can just sit down and come back? It\u2019s enough if I don\u2019t go after the second time.I quickly rolled my brain. If I accept this, Harmonia will owe me a huge debt. What should I tell her to pay me back to make a lucrative business?Diana. Temple. Power. Weakening.The main keyword passed through my head in an instantaneously. Then, a pretty good plan came to mind.I raised my head and stiffened my neck.\u201cOkay, so instead of accepting madam\u2019s offer, I have a favor to ask.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dHarmonia opened her mouth with emotion.\u201cJust say it. I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d\u201cKeep it a secret what I\u2019m pushing for, and carefully gather the opinions of the nobles. I want the temple to release a list of properties.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHarmonia\u2019s eyes grew as big as they could be. I lowered my eyes coyly.\u201cI can\u2019t do it if you can\u2019t. It\u2019s not so easy to be an advisor to the crown princess.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Marchioness, you can do it. You don\u2019t know unless you try.\u201dI glanced at her with my eyes moving.Suddenly my mind became complicated.Harmonia\u2019s efforts not to give up Diana somehow. Why is Diana so fascinating that she tries so hard? She\u2019s a total stranger.I even tried to make a wedge between Harmonia and Diana, but I think I failed. I think Helios has done quite a good job.Or is she giving Diana one last chance before she\u2019s abandoned?\u201cAll right, Madam Harmonia. I\u2019ll be waiting for the tea time invitation.\u201d\u201cThank you very much, Marchioness Hestia!\u201dHarmonia even had tears in her eyes. As if she were truly grateful.~~~~I was quietly lost in thought in the returning carriage. About Harmonia\u2019s faith in Diana.What a great friendship. It\u2019s almost impossible to help Diana even by telling me a sad story, unless you truly have affection for her.In the original work, Diana was able to enter the aristocratic society without difficulty thanks to Harmonia. The manners she taught her, the world, the physiology of the society. Harmonia\u2019s assistance was absolute.Harmonia thought that Diana could give a fresh shock to an aristocratic society. Born as a daughter of an aristocrat and living without marrying an aristocrat, Harmonia looked at the aristocratic society calmly at a strange border.**TN: Harmonia is an anomaly in the aristocratic society so she looks at it from an outside viewBut basically she wasn\u2019t a fighting personality. As her name suggests, she wanted everyone to be in harmony.\u201cShe has a big dream\u2026.\u201dA bitter talk to myself.What Harmonia wanted from Diana was \u201cchange,\u201d not \u201cfight.\u201d However, doesn\u2019t the word \u201cchange\u201d itself already contain an inevitable confrontation with the existing one?\u201cI thought you were a realistic person, but you were a complete romantic.\u201dShe is solely to blame for being my partner in crime. I know. Yeah, she should\u2019ve cut me off quickly. I\u2019m holding on to my lingering feelings.Now Harmonia, even if I didn\u2019t like it, has to make public opinion as I wish. By pressuring the temple to disclose its property list, the temple has no choice but to enter the fight against me, Diana, and even the temple.And she\u2019ll be right on my side, not on Diana\u2019s side.\u201cDiana. Diana\u2026.\u201dI laughed and shook my head excitedly. Does she know that my side is falling apart because of her stubbornness?If even Harmonia turned against her this time, it would be a great loss for Diana. She\u2019ll be in trouble if she underestimates the value of her friends or colleagues. The original heroine.By the way, what kind of atmosphere is tea time led by such stubbornness? I\u2019m not going to give her any advice anyway, so I\u2019m going to find something to enjoy.I\u2019m not sure when the invitation will come, or if it\u2019s really going to come before that, but I can\u2019t help but look forward to it.\u201cI wish I could tell you something interesting\u2026.\u201dThat\u2019s enough for me.One day I was waiting for a tea time invitation from Diana.It was heartbreaking that Kaelus said his eyes were tired. Eventually, I ordered Uross to bring in a skilled optician to the marquis.\u201cMy husband reads a lot of books and documents. I think we need to do something before it gets worse.\u201d\u201cOf course, you\u2019re right.\u201dThe optician bent over and agreed. He himself wore round-rimmed glasses.I took him to Kaelus\u2019 room.\u201cKaelus, the optician is here.\u201dHe was looking at diplomatic documents as usual. As we entered, we slowly laid the papers down on the table.\u201cOh, I see.\u201d\u201cOnce your eyes start to get worse, the rate of getting worse is very fast. When you feel tired, you need to take care of it quickly.\u201dThe servants picked up the whole table strewn with documents and put it aside. And on the clean table they brought, the optician opened a bag containing various tools.\u201cMarquis, I\u2019m sorry, but please wear this optometric measurement.\u201dI watched the work with interest. Basically, it was not much different from the process of making glasses in modern times.Fortunately, Kaelus\u2019 eye condition wasn\u2019t so bad. When looking at the writing, it was enough to manage to relieve fatigue.Naturally, glasses were a very expensive item in this world. It was burdensome to make a few more as a spare unless you were a decent aristocrat. On my paper, the lord of my adoption, Elea, should probably take it easy to get one.**TN: it would be difficult for him to get glassesHowever, the story is different if you are the lord of Illion, who is known to be rich.\u201cMake three more of the same. I\u2019ll be relieved if he has enough.\u201d\u201cYes, I will do as you say.\u201dMy order was answered by the optician with a beaming face.Kaelus seems to have been quite tired from measuring his eyesight by changing the glasses around.\u201cI feel a little dizzy.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Marquis, it\u2019s over now.\u201dThe optician sweated through his shirt.Unfortunately, there was almost no such thing as spectacle design in the world. At best, an antique pattern is drawn on the bridge of the glasses. It\u2019s a pity that it\u2019s not fun to choose by changing the frames like I used to do at the optician\u2019s.But let\u2019s ask.\u201cCan the lens only be round?\u201dThe optician looked at me with a quizzical expression.\u201cIn a different shape, you mean?\u201d\u201cYeah, square or streamlined.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026 Actually, I\u2019ve never tried anything else. It\u2019s hard to get the refractive index right\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell, I see. If you can afford to, it would be good to study it.\u201dIs the technology still difficult here? But since I threw it like this, something will come out in the future.~~~~After the optician returned, I shared tea with Kaelus.He smiled bitterly.\u201cI thought glasses were needed when you\u2019re middle-aged\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you put it off with that thought, you\u2019ll regret it a lot after losing your eyesight. Rather, if you start using glasses early, other people who have hesitated will slowly be encouraged. No matter what anyone says, your health is the best.\u201dHis head tilted slightly to the side.\u201cHave you been paying attention to my eyes?\u201d\u201cSure. It\u2019s my job.\u201dBesides, I\u2019m filling up some of my little desires. What do you mean, a man with glasses? Do you know how sharp and intelligent the guy in the rofan is? Although the strange law of second leads only applies.A little false smile leaked from him and soon sank into loneliness.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry for some reason.\u201dI know why Kaelus says so. Because he doesn\u2019t care about me as much as I do him.But it\u2019s only natural. It is possible because I pour infinite affection toward my favorite. On the other hand, Kaelus\u2019 favorite is not me.What glory would I expect from Kaelus in this novel? I just wish my favorite could heal his wounds and be happy, regardless of me.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to think about that at all. It\u2019s all for my goal.\u201dI replied as if I were taking care of my own interests so that he wouldn\u2019t feel sorry for anything. No, I\u2019m actually being honest. My goal is the happiness of my favorite.Kaelus opened his mouth as he stared at me.\u201cYour goal.\u2026 Did Heli and Diana say they were apologizing?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dTo be exact, not to me, but to Kaelus.\u201cCan you tell me what you want them to apologize for?\u201dHow can I resist what my favorite asks?\u201cIt\u2019s simple. They were too narrow-minded and selfish.\u201d\u201cDid they do anything special to you?\u201dKaelus is digging quite deep today. I should be careful.\u201cHa ha, there\u2019s no way high-ranking people would have targeted a meager existence like me. But let me just say that I lost the will to live because of them.\u201dThe specific answer threatens to reveal my identity. In particular, you should never let your guard down in the face of sharp insights from your favorite.And as expected.\u201cIs it related to me that it\u2019s their fault?\u201dSudden sharpness. I managed to keep my composure.\u201cNot much\u2026 No\u2026.\u201dIt was all that, actually.It was the only reason that made Kaelus give up his life on his own that made me angry. The decline of the empire due to the absence of Kaelus was of no concern to me.The same is true now. The unexpected damage that happens while I\u2019m throwing and splitting bait is out of my own interest.Diana and Helios were also immersed in their love, but they did not care about Kaelus and others. The original couple did the same, but am I the only one who should pay special attention to others?Let\u2019s make it clear. In the story I make, the main character is Kaelus alone. Other than that, it means I have a supporting role that does not matter whether I die or live for the main character. Isn\u2019t this the beauty of secondary creation?Therefore, to make the end of my story a happy ending, I will conceal my identity and make Kaelus the strongest man.I smiled on purpose with an air of awkwardness.\u201cThe trigger for my decision may be insignificant to others. But it was a very important event to me.\u201dWas my intention to not want to reveal it in detail fully conveyed?Kaelus slowly opened his mouth without taking his eyes off me.\u201cSomeday\u2026\u201dIf you wait in silence.\u201c\u2026I look forward to hearing it.\u201dMy heart heated silently.I replied, trying not to cry.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll tell you one day.\u201dThe purple eyes stared at me the whole time, and I couldn\u2019t bear to face it properly. I dodged his gaze.The heart that tickled for a while, but the words that followed, suddenly cooled down.\u201cBy the way, I\u2019d like to see his majesty in a few days. I\u2019n going back into politics.\u201d\u201cWhat? Already?\u201dKaelus replied coldly.\u201cAlready? I rested for too long. And as you predicted, if I want to prevent a crisis, I have to come back quickly and collect as much information as possible.\u201dThat\u2019s not wrong. Even when Kaelus decided to attend the concert, he said he could take on a heavy responsibility only if he proved his health to the world. This decision will also be an extension of that.The head admits it, but the heart doesn\u2019t. Kaelus has not yet fully returned to normal.\u201cThere\u2019s no need to rush back. You\u2019re not fully recovered\u2026.\u201d\u201cThis won\u2019t cure itself.\u201dStubborn Kaelus, then I have to point it out.\u201cEven if you meet Her Highness Diana every day?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dKaelus shut up for a moment. I didn\u2019t miss this opportunity to persuade him.\u201cThere is always the saintess next to the emperor now. His majesty\u2019s illness isn\u2019t getting better, so she doesn\u2019t leave for a second either. And yet, can you stand in front of them like nothing happened?\u201d\u201cHestia.\u201dHis voice cooled before I knew it. My heart froze too.\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dPurplish eyes that have cooled down.\u201cYou think I can\u2019t do it, do n\u2019t you? And I\u2019ve told you before. Diana is nothing to me anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI already know how you see me. But I\u2019m not as weak as you think.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI wanted to say it wasn\u2019t the case. But my lips wouldn\u2019t move. The cool air squeezed my whole body.\u201cI won\u2019t interfere with your move just because I\u2019m resuming my outside activities. If you\u2019re worried about that, I\u2019d say you can relax.\u201dThe cold purple eyes seem to penetrate me.\u201cYou can use your position as a marchioness as you have done. I won\u2019t disturb you at all.\u201dIt\u2019s not like that. I was really worried about you.\u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019d trust me if I say this. Then you should accompany me when I go to see his majesty. There, I just have to face Diana and see with your eyes how I\u2019m doing.\u201dI think I\u2019m going to cry because of the cold voice. Still, I managed to keep my mouth shut.\u201c\u2026Okay. I\u2019ll come with you.\u201dEven if Kaelus misunderstands me because of this answer, I can\u2019t help it.No, maybe it\u2019s not a misunderstanding. Maybe he saw through me more precisely than I did.That I don\u2019t believe in Kaelus. that I still see him as a sick person.I want him to be happy, but I want him to be in my hands. Maybe he recognized my dark greed that I didn\u2019t even realize.I rose to his feet in silence. Then I bowed very politely towards Kaelus.Thank you for teaching me about my stupidity.Speaking in my heart, I turned around and left.~~~~Kaelus acted unexpectedly quickly. As soon as he expressed his intention to return to politics, he asked the emperor to attend and immediately received the date.I still haven\u2019t received a tea time invitation from Diana. This made it clear how much the emperor anxiously awaited Kaelus\u2019 return.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dAnd the difficulties that have emerged. Helios and Diana are said to be with the emperor. Diana was expected, but even Helios?\u201cI\u2019m going crazy\u2026 It\u2019s one mountain over one\u00a0 mountain\u2026.\u201dIt was too hasty to say that Kaelus\u2019 symptoms have been cured by attending a concert once. Maybe he\u2019s overconfident in himself.But there\u2019s already spilled water. From now on, we have no choice but to do our best to make this event happen safely. Oh, I\u2019m cursing.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dWhat\u2019s the difference with just a fever? I sighed for a long time and calmly pictured the reality of the situation in my head.The emperor who welcomes Kaelus like a son. And Diana and Helios, who will sit awkwardly next to him. I don\u2019t know if the emperor knows the end of the relationship between the two best friends, but if he doesn\u2019t, he will also feel awkward and wonder.Diana would probably be wary of me all the time. Every time I open my mouth and say a word, she\u2019ll be on my nerves and observe me. She might believe in the emperor and the crown prince who support her and send a sharp message.Although it is an official audience, it will not be a hard and heavy atmosphere as Kaelus announces his return to politics for the first time in a long time. But unless his panic disorder is completely cured, it will be hard for him\u00a0 to laugh.\u201cPhew, good. The simulation is over!\u201dI patted my cheeks lightly.Swans seem to float gracefully on the surface of the water, but underneath they move their soles desperately. While Kaelus and the emperor have an elegant conversation, I have to constantly grasp the situation like the soles of a swan.I\u2019m the only one who can protect Kaelus there.I pulled the rope to call a maid running an errand.\u201cGo get the doctor.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am!\u201dThe preparation is thorough. The stabilizer is prepared in advance. If I pack the medicine in front of Kaelus\u2019\u00a0 eyes, he may feel down.~~~~A carriage to the imperial palace. Kaelus was silent the whole time.\u201c\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t think it\u2019s because he\u2019s upset with me, he\u2019s just very nervous.I added the words carefully.\u201cHow do you feel, Kaelus?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dAt last, as if out of his thoughts, he looked up at me.\u201cIt\u2019s just like that*.\u201d*TN: he\u2019s feeling just okay. Not good but not bad either\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s a relief.\u201dI answered back with a smile. I can\u2019t give off a lot of\u00a0 energy either.A faint smile flashed around Kaelus\u2019 mouth and quickly disappeared. He\u2019s trying to relax, but I guess it\u2019s not working well.I need to help a little bit.\u201cYou must be a little nervous because it\u2019s been a while. But honestly, I can\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s my first time doing this.\u201d\u201cFirst time? Oh, to see his majesty?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve only seen him from afar.\u201dI nodded his head softly.\u201cBut you\u2019re so strong that I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll be too nervous in the future.\u201d\u201cHaha, no way. His majesty is a very imposing man.\u201dThe tip of Kaelus\u2019 lips went up slightly at my words.\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d\u201cWell, I mean it..\u2026.\u201dJudging from his response, I seemed to have succeeded in relieving tension to some extent. That\u2019s a relief.I glanced at the clutch that I put down next to me. In that small handbag were some of Kaelus\u2019s vials in case of emergency. I have to be careful not to get caught if I check my bags.~~~~The emperor and the crown prince were there in advance. Kaelus and I slowly advanced before them, surrounded by servants and guards.A somewhat pale emperor. It was immediately apparent that he was a sick patient. Next to him, Diana and Helios showed an ecstatic image like a goddess and a male god, making it even more contrasting.\u201cI see the great empire sun.\u201d\u201cHonor to the wise family of the sun.\u201dThe highest formality. The face of an emperor who tolerates no mistakes.But strangely enough, as Kaelus said, I\u2019m not nervous at all. Why is this? Is it because the bystander\u2019s attitude is still firmly embedded in my consciousness?\u201cIt\u2019s been a while, Kaelus.\u201dThe emperor received Kaelus with a very gentle voice, even though he had no power. He soon responded to me.\u201cAnd Hestia. I\u2019ve heard of your story.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your majesty.\u201dI lowered myself somewhat.At the emperor\u2019s beckon, we sat side by side at the fancy table. Then I looked up and looked at Helios and Diana sitting next to the emperor. Naturally, I also sneaked a look at Kaelus\u2019 face.Kaelus looked at the emperor with a calm expression without a trace of agitation. It doesn\u2019t make the prince and his wife consciously uncomfortable, but it just feels like they\u2019re passing it over carelessly.Somehow my heart ached. I wonder how much he practiced and practiced alone. He must have tried hard to prove to me that he was fine.The emperor spoke to Kaelus.\u201cIn fact, Kaelus. I\u2019ve heard about your situation in detail from my son and his wife.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m ashamed.\u201dI became calm next to Kaelus, who responded calmly. If the emperor knows everything, it is rather easy to talk.Helios and Diana were quietly holding the tea. I don\u2019t know when they told the emperor, but it\u2019s much better than being exposed here by my own mouth. No, it\u2019s good judgment.Kaelus lifted his white face.\u201cYour majesty, I\u2019ll be in charge of the affairs again. I\u2019m sorry for causing you a lot of anxiety because I wasn\u2019t feeling well.\u201d\u201cWill you be all right? You don\u2019t have to overdo it, Kaelus.\u201dThat\u2019s what he\u2019s saying, but in reality the emperor seemed very pleased.Then Helios spoke.\u201cIs the marquis\u2019s sudden announcement of his return to politics influenced by his wife?\u201dKaelus and I looked at each other for a moment. Then, I replied to that.\u201cTo be honest, I dissuaded him. I don\u2019t think the marquis\u2019 health is completely restored yet.\u201d\u201cI thought this was enough. So I persuaded my wife.\u201dDiana\u2019s sea-colored eyes glided at me. I smiled as I looked at her eyes.The emperor looked at the two of us alternately.\u201cKaelus, what a reliable companion you have.\u201d\u201cThank you, your majesty.\u201dKaelus and I bowed our heads at the same time.The emperor\u2019s voice gently echoed the reality again.\u201cKaelus.\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead, your majesty.\u201dThe emperor glanced at his son and turned to Kaelus again.\u201cI\u2019ve also heard that your relationship with my son and his wife is not the same as before. But you\u2019re still like my second son.\u201d\u201cThank you, your majesty.\u201d\u201cI want you to be happy. Don\u2019t doubt that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just grateful for your kindness.\u201dKaelus answered the emperor without a hitch.I looked at my favorite without saying a word.It is a wonderful demonstration. It clearly showed me that in the presence of Helios and Diana, he could speak and answer with great care. Even when talking about his painful past, he was calm as if it were someone else\u2019s business.This is why I can\u2019t help but fall for him. My favorite is much stronger and more beautiful than I thought.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201dI bowed quickly at the emperor\u2019s call.\u201cThe marquis used to work alone most of the time. But now that you\u2019re with him, I feel very relieved. Please help Kaelus.\u201d\u201cYou mean this? I will help my husband with all my heart.\u201dThe emperor laughed aloud as if my answer was satisfactory.\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s good. In fact, you\u2019re an aide to Helios. I\u2019m sorry I\u2019m putting too much pressure on you, but I\u2019m saying this because I believe you can handle it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m flattered, your majesty.\u201dThe emperor did not seem to know why I became an aide to Helios. I wonder why Helios didn\u2019t reveal my \u2018ability\u2019 but let\u2019s just stay put for now.Diana, who had been quiet all along, finally opened her mouth.\u201cI hear there\u2019s a lot of praise for the marchioness in the Illion estate.\u201dHow long has it been since I heard the voice of the heroine? There was a spontaneous burst of laughter.\u201cOh, I\u2019m ashamed. Rumors are always full of exaggeration\u2026\u201dThen Helios snapped in.\u201cEven if it\u2019s exaggeration, if it goes on for a long time, it hardens like the truth.\u201dAs expected, Helios has a thorn in his tongue. He\u2019s always impatient because he can\u2019t eat me up.I responded without removing my smiling face.\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m always self-conscious. I know that my little skills have been inflated by people\u2019s mouths.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKaelus snorted. I\u2019m excited, too, you punk.Kaelus, with glazed eyes, jumped in.\u201cBut, your majesty. I\u2019ve been told you\u2019re sick lately.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dA momentary silence engulfed the table. I, Helios, and even Diana froze in an instant.What a bold statement. Bringing up the Emperor\u2019s health issues in the presence of a saint.If a half-hearted man had brought this up, he would have been in trouble, but fortunately, Kaelus is a high-ranking aristocrat who is absolutely trusted by the emperor. A position where you can be forgiven even if you go out boldly.The emperor laughed with embarrassment.\u201cIs that what they\u2019re saying outside?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe the original rumors, but I\u2019m a little worried after seeing your majesty\u2019s face today.\u201dKaelus answered unwaveringly.A thin ice-walking tension. I glanced at Helios. I made eye contact with him.Very slightly, he rolled his golden eyes sideways.\u201c\u2026.\u201dDamn it. I see. The emperor does not know that Kaelus and I know the truth.Helios and Diana never really told the emperor about my \u2018prophecy\u2019. I\u2019m sure Kaelus understood the situation through the flow of conversation a while ago.And yet he\u2019s so blatant about the emperor\u2019s health. What the hell are you thinking, Kaelus?I listened to their conversation with nervousness.\u201cDoesn\u2019t my complexion look good?\u201d\u201cI looked at your face with anxiety, and you seemed somewhat pale.\u201d\u201cHaha, I guess it\u2019s because I\u2019m old. But I\u2019m better than I look.\u201dThe emperor sighed briefly and continued.\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because Helios is going to the cabinet meeting instead of me. But Helios also has to succeed soon. The more experience he has, the better.\u201d\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cYour majesty!\u201dHelios\u2019 succession to the throne meant the death of the emperor himself. That\u2019s why the male and female characters are surprised.Kaelus spoke in that impertinent tone.\u201cBut your majesty was concerned about the presence of the crown prince. Your majesty is alive and well, so I don\u2019t think you have to worry about the well-being of this empire.\u201dA clean finish. This is the end of the issue.I admired silently. Isn\u2019t my favorite really a sophisticated politician!Showing his loyalty to the emperor, he warned Helios and Diana. \u201cI know your secrets\u201d.In short, Kaelus intentionally brought up the Emperor\u2019s health problem to send a message to the crown prince and his wife.It didn\u2019t have to be like this when they were best friends. But now Kaelus is not their friend.Will the marquis be regarded as a dear comrade or as an antagonist? The crown prince and his love must be deeply troubled.Since there\u2019s a straw mat*, I should help. Can we just let this great opportunity go?*TN: opportunityHe gathered his breath and spoke to the emperor.\u201cTo do this, we need to have a loyalist to support you more. That way, the empire and the imperial family will be solid.\u201dThe emperor looked at Kaelus with satisfaction.\u201cIsn\u2019t it enough that the Marquis Kaelus is back? Hestia.\u201dI glanced at Helios one more time before detonating the bomb. At that moment, his golden eyes were violently distorted.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAs expected, Helios is quick-witted. It\u2019s not Kaelus for me for no reason. He\u2019s handsome and smart. Have you already got a sense of what I\u2019m trying to say?I smiled with satisfaction.\u201cRather than the marquis\u2026 Wouldn\u2019t a duke be better?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201c!\u201dEveryone but me has hardened. Ah, the taste of this bomb.That\u2019s what it is. I do as much as Kaelus.Diana rebuked her anger in a repressive voice.\u201cIt\u2019s very arrogant and bold to say such a thing in such a place, Hestia.\u201dI gently lowered my posture.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your highness. I just remembered a precedent in which the Orcus family went on a rampage.\u201dWith my head down, I glanced at Kaelus.He remain motionless. He must be quite surprised too. Moreover, I fully understand because I put a sensitive name on my lips.But I believe in Kaelus. I did it boldly because I believed he would endure it.The emperor muttered groaningly.\u201cOrchus\u2026\u201dHelios, of course, signed me as an aide, and promised to raise Kaelus as Duke and give me the Attica estate \u2013 the Old Duke Orcus.But am I sure that fox-like lead will keep his word? Besides, he hates me a lot!When the time comes, he\u2019ll probably make excuses and put it off. I can\u2019t stand to see it.That\u2019s why I have to hit him first.I spoke with a deep bow.\u201cYou have to raise your most trusted servant to the highest. That way, the authority will not be challenged.\u201dThe voice of Helios flew in.\u201cHestia, we\u2019ll talk about it again later. This is not the right time.\u201dHe also seems very perplexed by the rigid tone. Oh, my. I\u2019m so sorry.In fact, I don\u2019t expect to hear an answer right now. Still, I mentioned the duke head-on in front of the emperor, so I will reap any fruit in the future.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your highness. Forgive me for disturbing you with my frivolous words and deeds.\u201dThat\u2019s it for today. I stepped back in a calm manner.The emperor laughed and waved his hand.\u201cThere you go, Hestia. I fully understand what you mean. Let\u2019s have a serious discussion with the crown prince.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026! I\u2019m honored, your majesty!\u201dI stood up immediately and saluted the emperor.The emperor laughed loudly.\u201cHahaha, Kaelus. What a perfect helper you got as a companion. I\u2019ll be honest with you now. In the meantime, II\u2019ve been secretly suffering from the relationship between you and Heli.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your majesty.\u201dKaelus bowed his head still.\u201cBut you\u2019ve relieved much of that today. In the end, you\u2019ve met a perfect match for you. Life is such a mystery.\u201d\u201cI will keep your words in mind.\u201dI bowed my head quietly, too. But the inside was boiling.He was able to meet me because he missed Diana? That\u2019s funny.Kaelus met me because he died in the past. Suffering from terrible despair.They will never sympathize with my favorite\u2019s suffering. That\u2019s it when they feel comfortable. I don\u2019t want to look back on how my favorite is enduring the pain now.The female lead, male lead, and his father are all the same seeds. Disgusting egotists.The emperor looked at Helios and said,\u201cThe crown prince has a good eye. It was a hundred good times to have Hestia as an aide. You\u2019ve got such a talented person.\u201d\u201c\u2026you\u2019re flattering me, father.\u201dHow angry he will be. He hates it, but his dad is complimenting him without knowing what to do.Helios would never admit that I was competent. The reason he has me as his aide is purely because he wants my \u2018prophecy\u2019. And at the cost of trust in Diana.~~~~Some time later, Diana spoke to the emperor.\u201cYour majesty, why don\u2019t you return to be? The marquis has just returned from his illness.\u201d\u201cOh, is that so?\u201dThe emperor nodded and accepted her words.I looked closely at the two people. Diana was probably worried about the emperor, not Kaelus. The man who is still desperately hiding the fact that he is sick.Kaelus and I rose from our seats and sent the emperor away.\u201cSee you at the next cabinet meeting, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201dThe emperor greeted Kaelus one last time, and walked slowly with the help of his servant.When he left the chamber completely, we also had to say farewell to the main couple.\u201cMay your Highness the crown prince and your Highness be blessed. We\u2019re leaving now.\u201dI greeted them with great respect.Helios replied with a roaring voice.\u201cI\u2019ll page you soon. Then you\u2019ll have to explain what happened today.\u201d\u201cWithout a doubt, I\u2019ll come running whenever you call me.\u201dI responded with a relaxed smile. Then, I turned towards Diana.\u201cYour Highness the crown princess. Someday, I will share tea with you and chat with you. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDiana was silent. Why don\u2019t you stop being so stubborn and send me an invitation to tea time?Kaelus finally said nothing to the two. As soon as the farewell was over, I turned very coldly.I followed him and turned my back on them.~~~~\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cWhy did you mention the duke?\u201dWhen the two of us\u00a0 were left alone in the carriage, a question from Kaelus came as expected.\u201cI can\u2019t trust the prince\u2019s promise alone. He hates me a lot.\u201dIn my answer, Kaelus murmured, smoothed his chin.\u201cHellie isn\u2019t that disingenuous.\u201dOh, no. Do you still believe in your old friend? Sometimes emotions win over reason.\u201cThere should always be a contingency plan.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t think he agrees, but it doesn\u2019t matter.Anyway, Kaelus did better than expected today in front of Helios and Diana. Indeed, the two focused solely on conversation with the emperor, as if they didn\u2019t care.Let\u2019s give him a short compliment with sincerity.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dI\u2019m afraid Kaelus was just closing his eyes. When his eyes opened again to my voice, I quickly fixed my mind.\u201c\u2026Never mind. Get some sleep. You must be tired, right?\u201cWell\u2026 it took more energy than I thought.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll tell you when we get there.\u201dYes, now is the time to get a little more sleep than listen to\u00a0 my drivel.My favorite. My Kaelus.I held my breath so as not to disturb his sweet sleep.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy favorite sleeping like a picture.I\u2019m going to store it in my heart.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 23": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBefore returning to politics in earnest, Kaelus decided to visit a secret library in the imperial palace library.The secret library was a place where the latest confidential information was stored at home and abroad, and was accessible only to those specially approved by the emperor.Kaelus was a close aide to the emperor and crown prince and a high-ranking nobleman that attended cabinet meetings since the time when the original novel was in full swing, and naturally had access.\u201cIf you want to go to the Imperial Palace, I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u201cWhatever you want.\u201dI couldn\u2019t let my favorite go alone, so I decided to go out together with him. I\u2019ll wait around while he\u2019s in the secret library.Preparations for going out were finished quickly because it wasn\u2019t intended for meeting the royal family. There\u2019s a free pass for the main gate of the palace if it\u2019s Kaelus. I got a taste of a new world where an outing to the imperial palace could be this simple.The carriage stopped when it reached the front of the library.\u201cCan I enter the general library?\u201dKaelus replied with a tone of utter nonsense.\u201cOf course, you\u2019re a noble, too.\u201d\u201cWell, I see\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s obvious that I\u2019ve never been to the library.I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dI followed Kaelus around the interior of the library. As described in the original novel, it had a neat and elegant atmosphere.However, the library always appears for a different purpose in the original rofan novel. Isn\u2019t the library a regular place where Diana and Helios engaged in affection?Diana and Helios had such a big love affair in this library. I didn\u2019t study what to do in this situation.Anyway, I decided to do it like the original characters since I came to this dating spot with my favorite for a long time.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go to the secret library. You stay here.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dI failed.Kaelus drifted away and I was left alone in the middle of the general library.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dThere\u2019s no hesitation. What a cold guy.I decided to put aside my regrets for now. Shouldn\u2019t I read something in the library? I\u2019m an aide to the crown prince after all.I wandered around the bookshelf and skimmed through the title of a book that looked mildly interesting. What did Diana read in the original? From the memory of a passionate reader who binge-read countless times, it was probably a novel.It\u2019s strange. Given the concerns of a saintess who cares about the people, shouldn\u2019t she be the first to see documents such as social status reports? But in the original novel, she was reading a sweet romance that was perfect for Helios to make fun of.\u201cYeah, that\u2019s it..\u201dI smirked when I found a title that didn\u2019t go with this magnificent palace library. [The Emperor\u2019s Woman.] It\u2019s seems like the title of a novel about a royal battle.I took out the book with a burst of laughter inside. There happened to be an empty seat nearby.Now, let\u2019s calm down and read\u2026.\u201c\u2026?\u201dThere is an air of darkness somewhere. A spine-chilling sensation.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI looked back timidly.\u201c!\u201dDamn. Why wasn\u2019t the bad hunch wrong?A tall man with yellow eyes and black hair came silently and stood like a statue.\u201cYour expression is worth seeing.\u201d\u201c\u2026Greetings to your highness.\u201dI got emotional for a moment, so my greeting came out a beat late. You\u2019d think I\u2019d forgive you because of that face.Helios opened his mouth indifferently.\u201cI happened to have something to say, so that\u2019s good. Come out for a second.\u201dI looked at the book I was about to read, and at the secret library. Then I asked back in my usual confident manner when dealing with him.\u201cDo I have to go far?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dWith a grim stare, I pointed in the direction in which Kaelus walked.\u201cMy husband is in the secret library. I was waiting nearby just in case he had a seizure.\u201d\u201cKael is here?\u201dOnly then did his eyes soften a little, but his tone was still curt.\u201cIt won\u2019t take long. Are you going to ignore my orders just to read such a popular novel?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dDamn it. Did you see it already? Anyway, he has good eyes.After glaring at the innocent book for no reason, I followed Helios.~~~~As soon as I got to the quiet place, I mentioned the bomb I detonated in the chamber.\u201cI apologize if you found it unpleasant for me\u00a0 to ask for the promotion of the duke that day.\u201d\u201cWell, what can I do if you don\u2019t believe even the memorandum written by the crown prince\u2019s seal?\u201dIt was very sarcastic, but I honestly wondered. Didn\u2019t you want me to explain or apologize? You\u2019re going to end it like this? I didn\u2019t think it would end like this because of how Helios was that day.I looked at Helios\u2019 face. It certainly felt more sober and serious than angry.His mouth opened again.\u201cDiana said you advised her to hide it for as long as possible.\u201d\u201c!\u201dOh, I guess the couple finally had a candid conversation.That\u2019s too bad. I wish it lasted a little longer. You should\u2019ve done it until the relationship got awkward.I strained my neck and pulled the tip of my lips at an angle.\u201cWhat do you mean advice? Am I a fool to give advice to the crown princess? Her highness who doesn\u2019t trust me, and she doesn\u2019t listen to my advice.\u201dActually, I didn\u2019t give her any advice, but I did throw a little fishing line. However, it was Diana\u2019s own choice to be caught lying like this.Anyway, I\u2019m not the one who would naively say, \u201cYes, I did,\u201d to Helios\u2019 inquisitive question. What a human thing to ask.His neat brows were distorted by my answer.\u201cDiana does not believe in your prophecies.\u201d\u201cOh, my lord, if she really didn\u2019t believe in my prophecy, she would have told you earlier. Why did you ask me when you know that?\u201dHelios\u2019 complexion grew darker and darker, as if I had hit the nail on the head.By the way, this guy, it seems like there\u2019s a hole every day by day. How are you going to be a politician if you show your face like this?I nailed it once again.\u201cYour highness the crown prince, As I\u2019ve told you before, the moment you doubt it, the prophecy is meaningless. The solution is simple. You can just leave my words and dismiss me from the position of an aide and that\u2019s it. Why are you hesitating?\u201d\u201c\u2026that\u2019s true. That\u2019s why it\u2019s more annoying.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dYou\u2019re being honest about this. It makes me feel bad.Helios raised his chin.\u201cIs the next prophecy ready yet?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s ridiculous. He said he\u2019d call me to a quiet place, but he meant for me to give another prophecy.He said with a shrug.\u201cIt\u2019s not big enough to determine the fate of the country, but there are small things.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll judge whether it\u2019s a big deal or not. Your arrogance hits the sky.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. I beg you to forgive me for making such an arbitrary decision with my narrow opinion.\u201dThe prophecy, which will be devoted in moderate, is extensively written in my fanatic notebook. The threat of war that Kaelus was informed of will not yet be revealedto Helios. If I tell him already, we\u2019ll get less credit for my favorite.As soon as Helios\u2019 lips were about to twist violently, I cleared my throat and mentioned another prophecy.\u201cThe fashion of dresses will change soon. In a way that emphasizes the feminine curve.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThat ridiculous expression. I know. What did I say? I warned you beforehand that it was trivial.I shook my head.\u201cYour Highness, it\u2019s not a good habit to cling to my prophecies. If you just wait for me, you\u2019ll miss what you can see by analyzing the phenomenon.\u201d\u201cHuh, you\u2019re going to educate me?\u201d\u201cYou seemed impatient, so I said something presumptuous. I\u2019m sorry to upset you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dWhy is it so quiet? I thought you\u2019d be sarcastic right away. Even his eyes are sinking.\u201cYour highness\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026do I look impatient?\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201dHelios muttered, expressionless.\u201cYou said I looked tired and depressed before.\u201dDid I say that? A cold sweat broke out for a moment.\u201cDid I\u2026??\u201d\u201cIt was the first time you checked to see if my father was feeling better.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dCome to think of it, I think I vaguely remember it.The bitterness slowly spread across his face. In the end, he turned his head away.What\u2019s wrong with him?\u201c\u2026If you don\u2019t have anything else to say, may I go see my husband now? He\u2019s recovered a lot, but I\u2019m still worried.\u201dIn the meantime, the emotion that was neatly settled on his face was slowly coming back to him.\u201cDid you say he was in the secret library?\u201d\u201cYes. Are you going to go?\u201dHelios strode away without answering my question. Wow, what kind of person is that?!I followed him with a startled air.\u201cYour Highness! If you suddenly head towards him like this\u2026!\u201dNo way! Kaelus would not have been prepared at all to meet Helios! What if he\u2019s the reason my favorite has a seizure and collapses?\u201cYour Highness Helios!\u201dThe double-sleeve curse came up to my throat. At the same time I held back my teeth, I reached for his hem desperately.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAt that moment, Helios jerked around. The wind caused me to lose my balance and tilt forward.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201d\u201c!\u201dAs soon as I was about to fall, his firm grasp held my arms tightly. Nevertheless, according to the law of inertia, I hit my face on the chest in front of me.\u201cHuh\u2026!\u201dI jumped back with almost animal reflexes. The hand that was holding my arm also shook me off instinctively.A double humiliation rang out in my head.Damn. I haven\u2019t even hugged my favorite yet, but I can\u2019t believe he hugged me first.~~~~\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNeither of us could say anything for a moment.But it\u2019s a damned situation where I have to apologize first. I dared to bump into the body of the heavenly prince!\u201c\u2026Sorry\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThat tight-lipped guy, Helios.If I gritted my teeth and apologized, at least accept it. This personality wrecker.\u201cMy husband will not be ready to see you yet.\u201dThe words were cut off here and there to quell the rising anger.But this is not the time to get angry, but to put my feet down.\u201cPlease\u2026.\u201dI bent down deeply and begged. My heart thumped.\u201c\u2026.\u201dA silence that feels as if it were a bombshell.How long has it been?\u201c\u2026you.\u201dA barely audible voice.\u201cDo you really love him?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dAt a sudden question, I unknowingly straightened out my bent body.\u201cYes, I love him.\u201dI don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking. Why do you check my love all of a sudden? No, it\u2019s crazy.\u201c\u2026is that so?\u201dI\u2019m answering him, but I feel a bit lonely?Oh, my God. Lonely. How must I look in Kaelus\u2019 eyes?\u00a0 By the man who must have fallen in love because of the endless love that the heroine poured.Helios spoke again in a rather subdued tone.\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll quit because you begged me so much.\u201d\u201cThank you, your highness!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dIn spite of my intense appreciation, he turned away without any response. Then he walked straight away.Little by little, the male lead moved away.\u201c\u2026What, really.\u201dAnyway, that\u2019s a relief. Helios was prevented from entering the secret library.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI rubbed my chest. The tension was relieved suddenly.Then, this time, I remembered the moment when I almost hugged him a little while ago.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dAgain, my mind suddenly got hot.Someday I\u2019ll kill that male lead, no, get rid of him. Damn.~~~~\u201cHave you waited long?\u201dAfter a long time, Kaelus, who had entered the secret library, returned. I was reading a book-actually pretending to be reading. Honestly, I was so angry that I couldn\u2019t see the letters.\u201cNo, you came out earlier than I expected.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHis eyes narrowed as he thought it was empty talk. I slipped away from the gaze.\u201cLet\u2019s go back now.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI followed him outside. The sun was setting before I knew it.I thought about whether to say it or not, but I finally decided to confess.\u201cThe crown prince stopped by the library earlier. He was going to go to the secret library, so I begged him not to.\u201dIt\u2019s a secret that the catastrophe happened.Kaelus\u2019 eyebrows curled up.\u201cOh, I see. It wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if he came in.\u201d\u201cBut don\u2019t let your guard down.\u201dI responded lightly. Then I shifted the subject to something else.\u201cDid you find the data you needed?\u201d\u201cI got everything I needed. I had to memorize everything because of security.\u201d\u201cWow\u2026.\u201dOf course, documents in the secret library can\u2019t be taken out, and in principle, it is prohibited to transcribe and leak them.For that reason, Kaelus must have just memorized it. My favorite is so smart.I should hurry home before he forgets what he memorized. I opened the window toward the coachman.\u201cRide as fast as you can. Of course, be careful.\u201d\u201cAlright, ma\u2019am.\u201dThe coachman, who heard my urging, waved the reins lightly. The carriage soon ran briskly.~~~~Late at night, I reflected on the day in the quiet room.It\u2019s definitely upsetting that Helios grabbed me by the arm and pulled me into his chest, but I have to put that aside and cool down.\u201cDiana was caught in her secret\u2026\u201dI wrote this phrase in the blank space of my fanatic notebook and circled it.Did she confide it herself? Or did she fail to overcome the interrogation and confess? Whatever it was, Helios would have made her stop treating with the meaningless divine power. Wasn\u2019t it Helios who hated unnecessary pretense to the point where he often omits etiquette?The part to focus on is elsewhere.According to Helios, Diana excused herself by saying \u2018She advised me to keep it secret\u2019.\u00a0 Of course it didn\u2019t work for the foxy bastard.\u201cIn terms of timing, it was just a while ago\u2026.\u201dPerhaps the two shared the prophecy after Kaelus\u2019s audience, which means that Diana kept her mouth shut even though she was suffering alone.The truth must already be spreading in secret, seeing that Erinnis tipped off about the emperor\u2019s condition at the concert. While stupid Diana was dragging her feet.Helios didn\u2019t understand the situation. No, it\u2019s the other way around. He must also have noticed that the secret was slowly slipping away.Nevertheless, they waited for each other. Until Diana was honest.\u201cIt\u2019s a tearful love. Hmph.\u201dAnyway, Diana gave Helios a lame excuse. You took my advice? Oh, my God, this is horse shit*.*TN: it was a bad lieThe whole empire knows that the person who hates me the most in the world is Diana. Rumors have spread about how I stepped on Diana\u2019s toes at her tea party, and so she couldn\u2019t have followed my advice so thoroughly. Even a passing dog is laughing.Helios must have been ridiculous, too. Nevertheless, I was prepared to watch their love be destroyed.And here too, his true feelings were revealed. Now Helios didn\u2019t believe Diana\u2019s words. The balance of trust between me and Diana leaned a little more towards me.\u201cShould I like this or not?\u201dI giggled.Love and trust are one thing and another. You may love but not trust, and even if you trust, you may not have the feeling of love. Helios will still love Diana, but he will no longer trust her.This is not a bad harvest compared to what I worked on. I couldn\u2019t break the heart of love, but I broke the bond of trust.In any case, due to the setting of the original novel, the only woman who loves the male lead is Diana. That\u2019s not within my reach.And Diana said she didn\u2019t believe in the prophecies, but by now it\u2019s not a matter of believing or not. She\u2019s already feeling it day by day. The fact that she\u2019s losing her power.\u201cIt\u2019s time for the temple to step up.\u201dWhen there is nothing to be done with one\u2019s own ability alone, people usually attract the forces who will be on their side. Diana, who has a steady relationship with the temple, will be the first to open her hands to the priests.The sooner the temple\u2019s political intervention becomes visible, the better. That way, the public opinion that I\u2019m collecting through Harmonia will be even more powerful.The disclosure of the properties of the temple.Basically, the images of priests who serve God are \u2018integrity\u2019 and \u2018clean poverty\u2019. Based on this image, Diana also performed her role as a heroine as a so-called \u201cabsolute good.\u201dBut what if that\u2019s not the case? What if the temple, which was thought to be saving the poor by using all of its wealth, was actually building up a huge fortune and expanding its control?The betrayal of the common people will be indescribable. It turns out that those who are a \u2018servant of God\u2019 are no different from a greedy nobleman.If soap is popular like Illion in the capital at the right time, the synergy effect will be excellent.\u201cI think I\u2019ll have to extend my modeling contract.

    "Chapter 24": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter being caught in her secret, Diana certainly seemed to have changed her mind.\u201cOh, you\u2019re finally here!\u201dI hummed.Finally, the long-awaited invitation came. We invite you to tea time with Diana and her friends!But no hair was pulled out. The date on the invitation was the very next day. She wouldn\u2019t give me time to prepare.It\u2019s annoying, but it\u2019s not like I can\u2019t get over it.\u201cPhew, don\u2019t you think I should dress up?\u201dI can never beat Diana by appearance. She\u2019s the beauty of the world from the start. She\u2019s a good girl, pretty, and the male characters in the novel couldn\u2019t help but fall in love with her.Therefore, we must compete in a thorough atmosphere. It is important to firmly build my own image that Diana cannot imitate.I rushed for Clarice and Tekima.\u201cTomorrow is the tea time of her majesty the crown princess. But I want to be perfectly prepared.\u201dClarice opened his mouth with a serious look.\u201cFirst of all, make sure to wear the seal ring. There\u2019s nothing like showing your authority at once.\u201dTekima also said, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief.\u201cDo you have any direction or strategy in mind? We\u2019ll pick your outfits and accessories accordingly.\u201dI lined up all my clothes and accessories in front of them. At the unfolding spectacle, some of the maids did not leave the room and snooped around.\u201cWell, that\u2019s all I have. I want a color that is completely contrasted with her highness. I don\u2019t have to look good.\u201dIt was not only to Tekima and Clarice, but also to the ladies of the house.What do I need now? It\u2019s collective intelligence!When I gave permission, each of them began to speak up. The room soon became noisy.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you wear all black? Your hair color is black, so I think it\u2019ll look good on you!\u201d\u201cIt would look like the crown prince. Rather, Lady Hestia, the people there are mostly single young girls, so how about a dignified atmosphere?\u201d\u201cOh, my God, Lady Hestia is the same age!\u201dI guess it was pretty loud. In the middle of the noise, I heard a gentle tap on the open door.\u201cLady\u00a0 Hestia. It\u2019s Uross.\u201dI suddenly came to my senses.\u201cOh, was it too loud? I should have kept the door closed.\u201d\u201cHaha, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just that the master is curious\u2026.\u201dGosh. There is a person at home who is quietly studying diplomatic secrets, but I stopped him by bothering him.My face turned red apologetically. Just when I was in a hurry to tidy up.\u201cSomething\u2019s intense. Can I join you?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dMy favorite is here! He tied his long silver hair to the back to show off his pure beauty! Oh, where\u2019s the gun? There can\u2019t be two suns in the world, so I should shoot the sun in the sky right now.The people gave way to Kaelus. He sat next to me with his long legs crossed, quite rightly.\u201cKeep going.\u201dOh, I\u2019m getting hit. This proud and imposing figure.\u201cWell, then\u2026.\u201dI slipped my hand onto the burning cheek. It\u2019s hot.After coughing once, Clarice continued what she was really doing.\u201cI\u2019d like to recommend some heavy colors, too. But considering your age, it\u2019s not a bad idea to expose yourself as boldly as young ladies.\u201dNo, exposure?!\u201cOh, the lady-in-waiting thinks the same as me. It would be pretty cool to paint on the exposed skin.\u201dWhat? What are you drawing on my skin?But what a great idea this is, the ladies of the house began to exclaim.\u201cWhat a great idea!\u201d\u201cNo one will be able to take their eyes off of you!\u201dThen Kaelus asked suddenly.\u201cWhere are you going? Why are you thinking so hard?\u201d\u201cHer highness the crown princess invited me to tea time. With her young friends\u2026.\u201dAs I answered, my voice gradually became smaller. In the end, I was struggling not to fall behind Diana.\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus was silent, too.Shame is shame, and anyway, shouldn\u2019t we solve what\u2019s coming tomorrow? It\u2019s in front of Kaelus, but I have no choice but to put an iron plate on my face*.*TN: put on a strong frontI raised my red face, and continued to prepare.\u201cWell\u2026 let\u2019s pick the right dress.\u201dAt my word, Clarice quickly picked up a dress.\u201cThis color looks just right, Lady Hestia,\u201dTekima quickly helped.\u201cI\u2019ll have to touch the shoulders and chest. I can do it in no time.\u201d\u201cOkay, let\u2019s decide on this.\u201dA quick decision.Clarice\u2019 choice of dress fell into Tekima\u2019s hands. He scrambled without hesitation even though everyone, including Kaelus, was watching. Maybe it\u2019s because he knows it\u2019s not a very expensive fabric, so he\u2019s very bold.\u201cIt\u2019s done. Marchioness, would you like to try it on?\u201dI woke up and said to Kaelus.\u201cI\u2019ll go change.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHe answered by nodding, his finger supporting his head.Inside the dress room, Clarice and the maids helped me change. How the cut fits so well, Tekima\u2019s dexterity should be recognized anyway. The end of the freshly cut fabric are not finished, so it\u2019s a little loose, but it can\u2019t be helped right now.I came out after changing clothes.\u201cWell, what do you think?\u201dSkin that shows more boldly under the collarbone line. Almost all sleeves were cut off to make it a sleeveless dress.Tekima diligently picked out the accessories by wiping his forehead with a handkerchief.\u201cPut on these long gloves that go up on your elbows\u2026. Oh, bracelets are perfect for your wrist.\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat about the necklace?\u201dEven though Kaelus casually asked, Tekima was not detered at all.\u201cWell, I wish the rope were thicker, but that\u2019s fine. If we paint on the skin, it\u2019s better that the jewelry isn\u2019t too intense.\u201d\u201cWhere and what are you going to draw?\u201dSomehow, questions and answers only come and go between Kaelus and Tekima.\u201cAs I recall right now, I\u2019m going to draw a long curve up and down all over one of her arms\u2026 then the side of the neck and shoulders\u2026.\u201dI turned gently around not to disturb Tekima\u2019s inspiration.\u201cI\u2019m planning to draw petals and stems in a curved shape, but do you want anything else?\u201dSnake. Viper. It\u2019s going to be very intense.But I murmured inwardly. Because if I really did, there would be a flock of sheep\u2014with pure expressions.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKaelus looked at me with serious eyes.\u201c\u2026\u201dUgh. I don\u2019t know. My favorite is staring at my body. My face is bleeding like it\u2019s going to explode.At last he spoke.\u201cFlames.\u201d\u201c?\u201dI didn\u2019t understand as quickly and just blinked. On the other hand, expert Tekima was much faster than me.\u201cOh! That\u2019s a very good idea, marquis.\u201d\u201cInstead of red, I\u2019d do blue.\u201dKaelus added with an indifferent look. Tekima nodded and took notes.\u201cYes, I see. Blue flames are hotter by nature.\u201dI can\u2019t stop laughing at Tekima\u2019s face.~~~~~Tekima quickly returned to the studio, saying he would complete the reformed dress. Clarice and other maids moved in perfect order and organized the room.Meanwhile, I poured coffee for Kaelus.\u201cIt was too loud\u2026?\u201dWhen I asked awkwardly, an unexpectedly simple answer came back.\u201cNo. It was a rare sight in this house, so it was quite fun.\u201dI calmly explained how I was invited to Diana\u2019s tea time.\u201cActually, Madame Harmonia asked me desperately. There was no suitable advisor around her, and she said she wanted me to be close to her.\u201d\u201cOh, but you don\u2019t like her very much.\u201d\u201cHonestly\u2026 I don\u2019t like her personally, but I don\u2019t want to completely ignore madam\u2019s request. What\u2019s more surprising is that the crown princess sent me an invitation.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus looked down slightly, as if he were thinking something.I\u2019m going crazy. I\u2019m starting to get excited by myself again. The pure, silver-haired, cold-looking man who\u2019s lost in thought!Before the round of silly comments spread out of my head, I quickly took a sip of coffee. Wake up, wake up.A faint sigh came out of his lips.\u201cThe crown princess seems to be in a pretty bad situation.\u201d\u201cOh, you think so, don\u2019t you? I guessed similarly.\u201dI added with a wry smile.\u201cI don\u2019t think she invited you in a good way. She might rebuke you on the spot again. Still, it\u2019s a pretty bad choice for a change of pace in her situation.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKaelus touched his chin and slowly shook his head.The surrounding area became quiet, and only me and Kaelus were left in the room.Let me ask him again at this point. I wonder if it\u2019s inconvenient for him to confront Diana so fiercely.\u201cWell, Kaelus.\u201d\u201c?\u201dKaelus raised her eyes indifferently.\u201cPlease let me know if it bothers you. I mean, this is how I meet with\u00a0 the crown princess.\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dHe twisted the tip of his lips slightly.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t care. But sometimes I think about this.\u201dA lonely continuation of words.\u201c\u2026whether I like it or hate it, I wonder why I\u2019m so eager when it\u2019s annoying to have \u2019emotions\u2019 in any way.\u201dIt was something that only those who truly felt skeptical about life itself could say. It breaks my heart that I seemed to have tasted his pain that is still in progress.Even if the outward life was slowly returning to its former days, the wounds deeply engraved on his heart were not easily healed. Maybe I can never erase it.There is no such thing as a wound that disappears with a wash. It may fade a little over the years, but it is impossible to live as if it never existed.So you shouldn\u2019t hurt someone recklessly. Whether it\u2019s big or small, the wounds of the heart can remain like scars for the rest of his life.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI bowed my head. No matter how much I make a fuss, I can\u2019t completely heal that deep wound in Kaelus.However, instead of me who is doing my best to heal his wounds, I am just acting as a person who sympathizes with his pain and represents revenge that he cannot do.When is the most unfair and resentful time in your life? It\u2019s hard and painful for me, but it\u2019s time for my opponent to stretch her feet.**TN: Diana can\u2019t be sitting peacefully anymore so she needs to prepare to runHowever, such emotions are possible only when there is some strength left in the body and mind. If life has collapsed beyond even this.As Kaelus said a while ago, even \u201cbeing unfair and resentful\u201d becomes difficult. I don\u2019t want to feel any emotion, I\u2019m just dazed and barely holding my breath.Is it frustrating? Why don\u2019t you take revenge quickly? Do I want to use that hate as leverage to urge him to stand up? But that\u2019s the arrogance of a woman who hasn\u2019t lost everything.\u201cTomorrow, I wish you good luck.\u201dKaelus laid down his coffee cup on the table. And as always, I slowly got up and walked.\u201c\u2026Yes. I\u2019ll be back.\u201dI feel like crying for no reason.~~~~Despite the tight schedule, Tekima stayed up all night to finish and brought the finished work early the next morning.\u201cAs I said yesterday, I\u2019ll draw a picture on the exposed area, marchioness.\u201dAnother important weapon along with the dress.Even though we aren\u2019t painting all over the body like modern artists do, this \u2018temporary tattoo\u2019 that Tekima decided and prepared was also a kind of body painting.A protective sheet was laid on the bed. I lay on my stomach in comfortable pajamas.When I put my exposed arm on the pillow, the work finally began.\u201cI\u2019m going to use an indelible pigment for hours. It doesn\u2019t spread easily even if sweat or a little bit of water touches it.\u201dI was slightly impressed by Tekima\u2019s explanation.\u201cWhen the hell did you study this stuff?\u201d\u201cMadam marquis. I have a party going on all day long in my head.\u201dI lay face down and laughed. The wind made Tekima look serious.\u201cOh, I can\u2019t draw if you shake like this.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThe room soon became quiet.Tekima concentrated horribly. Even though he must have been tired from working all night, he was full of energy as if he were not tired at all.A colorful pattern was soon formed on the flat skin.Blue flames. The image that came to mind when Kaelus looked at me.\u201c\u2026.\u201dMy heart is throbbing. My heart is bursting with emotion.I got a big present, unexpected. Something incredible that I dare not price.I\u2019m so thankful for Kaelus that I don\u2019t have any regrets even if I die like this.Blue flames. Blue looks colder than red, but it\u2019s actually much hotter.Well, it seems too self-conscious to give this meaning, but whatever. How can a successful fan be like this? An invincible fan who survived transmigration. Aren\u2019t I the obsessive reader who regained the second lead that was blown away from the original after the original?When the work on the arm was finished, he moved to the back of the neck this time. The tip of a careful brush passed cautiously over the skin.I wish there were pictures in this world. I miss it, too.The painting was finished before I knew it.\u201cThank you for your hard work. Marchioness, it\u2019s done.\u201dTekima sighed loudly and backed away. I stood up in front of the mirror.\u201cWow\u2026.\u201d\u201cDo you like it?\u201d\u201cOf course! How wonderful.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll be better if you put on your dress, marchioness.\u201dTekima smiled confidently.In that case, we need to check it out. With the help of the maids, the dress was quickly put on.\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dIndeed, his confidence was not in vain. The blue flame, which rises from the long gloves and spreads on the forearm, itself was a colorful accessory.Clarice, who was smiling with satisfaction, nudged.\u201cKaelus would love to see it. Why don\u2019t you go there?\u201d\u201cDo you think so?\u201dPretending not to be able to ignore the invitation, I found Kaelus\u2019 room looking ready to go out.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t enter confidently and knocked on the open door. Fortunately, he recognized it.\u201cHess?\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dI hesitated into the room. I lifted my arm slightly and turned around in place.\u201cIt\u2019s complete.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dKaelus\u2019 purple eyes were rarely enlarged. It looks pretty good to him, too.\u201cThanks to you, it became a wonderful work. Thank you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m glad it suits you.\u201dI can\u2019t express my gratitude for him in words, but I still want to say it.\u201cI mean it. Blue flames. I\u2019m so grateful that you thought of this image after seeing me. I feel like I got the biggest gift in my life.\u201d\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever received a gift, have you?\u201d\u201cHa ha, that\u2019s not it, that means it\u2019s the most precious.\u201dI laughed out loud.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be back.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInstead of talking, Kaelus responded by raising his hand lightly.~~~~\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dAs soon as I entered the palace, I felt people\u2019s eyes catching. The court ladies who were passing by even stopped walking.I can\u2019t help but stand out. I\u2019m not wearing expensive jewelry, but I have something more beautiful than jewelry.As Clarice advised, a seal ring was proudly placed on the finger. None of the young lovers attending today owned the family\u2019s seal ring. So this ring suggests that the water we play are different.I headed for my destination with a brisk step. The patronage of the lily palace. It was a place full of flowers that Diana took care of herself.Diana was also talented in gardening in the original work. Original fans used to refer to her as Druid.\u201cOh, Marchioness Hestia!\u201dMadam Harmonia, who was here first, greeted me warmly.\u201cHow are you, Madam?\u201d\u201cOh, my\u2026.\u201dHer reaction is very dramatic, after all, when I deliberately took it in a nonchalant way. Breathing in and covering her lips with her hands, she looked at the guests once and came back to me.\u201cOh, my God, I\u2019ve never seen anything like this before!\u201d\u201cWhoa, thanks to a good designer. Oh, and this flame pattern was my husband\u2019s idea.\u201dI stretched my chest.Young ladies my age couldn\u2019t take their eyes off me. I\u2019ve brushed you off at banquets, but it\u2019s my first time greeting you formally, so I introduced myself with dignity.\u201cMy name is Hestia. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201dI winked at Harmonia. Obviously, she promised to be on my side here? Didn\u2019t she tell me before that I just had to stay put?\u201cHo-ho, you\u2019ve come all the way here. Thank you from the bottom of my heart, marchioness.\u201dShe, who was also experienced, soon noticed the meaning of my eyes.There was no aristocrat who didn\u2019t know the uncomfortable relationship between Diana and I. The young ladies also exchanged eyes with each other, and finally one brave person came forward and greeted me ceremonially.\u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot about Lady Marquis. I hope you enjoy the refreshments and go home.\u201dThere is a sense of vigilance that is not completely hidden. But I didn\u2019t bother to be offended. I\u2019m not here to make friends.Meanwhile, as Harmonia said, there were attendees who were curious about me.\u201cWell, if you don\u2019t mind, may I ask how you dressed up?\u201d\u201cOh, of course.\u201dI replied with a beaming face.\u201cYou know, her majesty likes to be frugal. So instead of fancy dresses and accessories, I drew pictures using skin as a canvas.\u201d\u201cOh, oh\u2026.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t originally intended like this, but it\u2019s a better interpretation than a dream, and it\u2019s a good meaning, so it\u2019s enough to say it on the spot.Anyway, the important thing is to emphasize to them that I\u2019m not here to fight Diana.\u201cI was thinking about what I should draw, but my husband gave me the answer. So like this\u2026.\u201dI showed the blue flame on my arms and neck. A small exclamation burst forth among the ladies.Someone threw it out of course.\u201cMarquis Kaelus seems to be very fond of the marchioness, doesn\u2019t he?\u201dIt\u2019s finally out. Curious pride that Kaelus would love a woman other than Diana. It\u2019s just bad luck because they are Diana\u2019s friends.I raised my chin leisurely.\u201cTo be exact, I\u2019m fully acknowledged as a trusted companion to the marquis. Doesn\u2019t that sound like Kaelus?\u201dI glanced indifferently at the colorful gaze at me.\u201cLove is indeed a sweet dream. But life is a reality. My husband and I agreed to stick to this reality.\u201d\u201cThen are you very satisfied with your present life?\u201dAnother asked. I nodded my head as if it were natural.\u201cWhat can I say? I couldn\u2019t be happier.\u201dTheir eyes slowly shrunk from my unabated attitude. That\u2019s right. The world thinks the pushover is more easy.At the time when we were fighting with young ladies.\u201cHer highness the crown princess is coming in.\u201dA solemnly ringing voice. We all rose from our seats to greet the elders of the imperial family.Soon Diana, accompanied by the maids, appeared.Pink hair swaying in the air, blue eyes that seem to capture the ocean as it was, and spotless white skin.It is a beauty that you have no choice but to admire every time you see it. A creature so loved by God that on the surface she was an unquestionable saintess.We all bowed down to be polite.\u201cHonor to the great little moon of the empire.\u201dI deliberately lowered myself a beat behind the others. I don\u2019t forget to make eye contact with Diana at that short moment.\u201cHonor to\u2026.\u201dA smile flashed around my mouth. Diana, how can you entertain me in front of me today?\u201c\u2026.\u201dIt took a moment of hesitation to respond.Her feelings were felt in between. Shewouldn\u2019t want to accept the courtesy until she\u2019s satisfied, but there are other young lovers besides me, so she had no choice but to open her mouth.\u201c\u2026Everyone get up.\u201dRaising myself, I smiled broadly. I\u2019m so glad to see her.~~~~A fresh scent of flowers and the murmur of water flowing from somewhere. It is a landscape that seems to be in the middle of Mother Nature.\u201cI really don\u2019t know what to do with you showing me such a wonderful place, your highness the crown princess.\u201dIt\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been invited to her private meeting, so of course I should be grateful. However, it is important to watch carefully what kind of expression Diana makes at this remark.Diana looked straight at me with a faint smile.\u201cI invited you here because I thought I would talk to you a lot in the future. Do you like it?\u201dOh, look at this. Something\u2019s definitely changed.Unlike before, when she openly showed off her dislike with a stiff face, now she seems to have some kind of revenge on me.Of course, if she was as good at facial expressions as I was, she wouldn\u2019t have noticed at all, but unfortunately she was a beginner.In the past, when she only lived as a cider heroine, what would she have done to hide her true feelings and devise a scheme? I have the absolute advantage in this kind of underwater fight, as a woman who\u2019s been good at stealing.\u201cYes, I\u2019m so thrilled. Isn\u2019t this the place where only your beloved friends come in?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a little exaggerated. Anyone who wants to chat with me can see this garden.\u201dWow, our actress has improved a lot. I can\u2019t believe you can smile so brightly on the outside while holding a knife inside.Then I\u2019ll have to raise my eye level a little. You can\u2019t get stabbed if you let your guard down.Diana\u2019s maids poured tea into the guests\u2019 teacups. Of course, a light full-color liquid was filled in front of me.\u201c\u2026.\u201dJust looking at it, it doesn\u2019t look like it\u2019s going to taste good. Where else are you bringing a cheap tea and forcing it to be frugal?Diana\u2019s friends, including Harmonia, were already familiar with the tea. They all had their teas gracefully, without a change of expression.You guys are amazing. Should I pretend to drink, too?\u201cBy the way, Marchioness Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead, your highness the crown princess.\u201dFor some reason, Diana spoke to me first. It\u2019s unusual, so I\u2019m determined.\u201cI heard from the temple\u2019s priests that you have not yet prayed for repentance in the temple.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dI glanced at Harmonia with an embarrassed smile. What? That\u2019s a different story. You said she wouldn\u2019t attack me!But Harmonia also seemed surprised. As soon as she met my eyes, her face quickly turned red.I knew this would happen. I just sighed.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. The construction was busy so I couldn\u2019t leave. I\u2019ll be sure to stop by soon.\u201d\u201cIt is said that you were diligent in attending social events. No matter how busy you are, don\u2019t you always have to keep your priorities?\u201dThat\u2019s your priority. I\u2019m different.But Diana would never admit it, so I\u2019ll have to make a decent excuse.\u201cYour words are right. Even though I couldn\u2019t find the temple myself, God knows my sincerity in asking for forgiveness. You are the one who always sees the heart of the heart.\u201dEven if you go to work regularly in the temple, it\u2019s useless if you don\u2019t have sincerity. Then the opposite should be admitted.Little by little, there was tension.Fortunately, the youngsters did not rush to help Diana. You may have been tipped off by Harmonia in advance, or you may have been sympathetic to the cause of Countess Erinnis.Whatever it is, just staying still is a great benefit to me.As Diana and I slowly showed signs, Harmonia quickly intervened, thinking that this should not be the case.\u201cBy the way, I heard something very interesting from people from Illion.\u201d\u201cOh, what is it?\u201dThe young ladies, who had been looking around, also welcomed the change of the topic as if they had waited. Harmonia gained more strength when it gained support.\u201cThe marchioness is providing cheap soap to the people of the country. I heard that ordinary people are very satisfied with the quality.\u201d\u201cOh, you mean that.\u201dI smiled.\u201cAs a commoner, being in a noble family made me want to share the good things widely. Cleanliness is also important to God.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cFirst, I started supplying Illion, which I controlled. We have to help the people of the land maintain a clean body and mind at all times.\u201dAfter I finished speaking, I looked at Diana with a defiant look.Now, what do you think? What are you going to pick on?\u201c\u2026\u201dInvisible flames are popping fiercely in the tightly pulled air.Then Diana opened her mouth.\u201cSoap\u2026 \u2026I\u2019ve heard rumors. They say it\u2019s very fragrant even though it\u2019s cheap.\u201d\u201cI wanted to make it feel as luxurious as possible. My husband\u2019s advice was very helpful.\u201dI said with a pleased smile.Then some young lady responded favorably.\u201cI guess Lord Kaelus is really interested in Lady Hestia. I can\u2019t believe he advised the marchioness\u2019 soap business as well as the flame you\u2019re decorated with today.\u201d\u201cLady Marquis is truly incredible. You were recognized by the cold marquis.\u201dAha. Are these the kind that Harmonia talked about? A bunch of people who said they liked me.I\u2019m sending them heart-shaped eyes, too.\u201cYou\u2019re\u2026\u201dThe voice of Diana, who sank steadily.\u201c\u2026you\u2019ve encouraged me to admire the nobility.\u201d\u201c!\u201dShe set her eyes straight on me with firm confidence in one\u2019s logic.\u201cScent actually doesn\u2019t play a big role in the cleaning power of soap. Instead of removing the scent, it could have been supplied more cheaply, or even for free.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dWow, it\u2019s more than I expected. I was wondering what you were going to find fault with, and this is how it goes.I shut my mouth in silence. Diana\u2019s counterargument continued.\u201cIf you really cared about commonors, you should have supplied it for free instead of reaping the benefits. The really poor will not even be able to pay for the soap.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut you didn\u2019t do that. On the contrary, even if it costs more to produce it, you purposely made soap that smells like what aristocrats use, and you made the common people buy it and use it to admire and praise the lives of aristocrats.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a truly clever and thorough governance strategy. Isn\u2019t the marchioness also a commoner? Why didn\u2019t you look a little lower?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201dFor now, let\u2019s listen to the end of what that righteous heroine says.\u201cHestia, it\u2019s a pity if your soap business is to deny your origins and fuel the desire to rise in status for the common people.\u201dMy origins? The one I was set up as a commoner extra? What about you, Diana? Weren\u2019t you originally a commoner?Is she going to say that raising the status of the common people is not right while being so good-natured? What\u2019s so wrong with a normal person pursuing a way to eat and live well?I slowly raised my head. It\u2019s time for a counterattack.\u201cYour highness, holy lady. Aren\u2019t you the same as me?\u201d\u201c!\u201dDiana\u2019s big eyes were distorted for a moment.Harmonia whispered urgently.\u201cLady Marquis\u2026\u201d!\u201dI didn\u2019t even look at madam.\u201cYour Highness Diana. Your highness, as a commoner, will you not deny that you have risen to this position?\u201d\u201cHestia, I\u2019m not like you. There\u2019s a misunderstanding.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by misunderstanding?\u201dTea time is completely ruined.Harmonia bowed her head. She\u2019ll be ashamed to see me. She promised me everything would be all right, just sit down and go, but it turned out like this.However, it was rather good. You\u2019re not going to push me to be Diana\u2019s advisor anymore. If I turn my back on Diana perfectly today, it\u2019s the icing on the cake.Diana replied quite proudly.\u201cI didn\u2019t make any effort to become a nobleman. I just did my best in my position. And so I made a covenant with Helios, and as a result I became a crown princess.\u201dSo according to her logic, it\u2019s not her fault that she became a royal by dating? Am I wrong because I became an aristocrat by contract marriage?I twisted my lips up.\u201cThen you deny all kinds of political marriages. I\u2019m sure some of the young people here are having such a political marriage, but aren\u2019t you going too far?All the young lovers who were brought in by surprise held their breath. Diana immediately refuted.\u201cThe need-to-take political spirit and your case are completely different. What on earth would Kaelus propose marriage to get from you? All you had was the status of the adopted daughter of the lord of Elea.\u201dThere\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t say.\u201cEveryone in the world knows it, but they don\u2019t dare to say it. While Caelus was wandering because of my marriage to Heli, you were..\u201dHa. I can\u2019t listen to it anymore.\u201cI took the marchioness\u2019 place with a cheap trick. For your own benefit\u2026.\u201dLaughter.\u201c?!\u201d\u201c!\u201dPeople were silently appalled by the blatant ridicule.I showed my twisted smile to my heart\u2019s content, as if I were dying of joy.\u201cAlright, Diana. Since everyone here refuses to say it, I\u2019ll say it while I\u2019m at it.\u201dI love this close tension just before it explodes.I pointed my finger at the tea cup.\u201cEveryone, did you enjoy your tea?\u201d~~~~A pale color that is not thickly brewed.An incredibly low-grade tea served by the royal family to the nobles. If you pick rosemary growing somewhere in this garden and brew it, it\u2019ll be thicker and tastier than this.I asked again with a grin.\u201cIs this tea really worth drinking? Even I, a commoner, can\u2019t drink this tea.\u201dAmid all the blatant complaints.\u201cDon\u2019t you originally prefer coffee to tea? Of course it won\u2019t suit your taste.\u201dOnly Diana stared at me with her eyes open.\u201cEven if I enjoy coffee more, I\u2019m the marquis\u2019 hostess. I\u2019m not so uneducated that I can\u2019t tell the difference between these cheap teas.\u201d\u201cHow long has it been since you lived as an aristocrat?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a lot longer than your highness, who became a royal family at least a few months ago. I had long since acquired a peerage as the adopted daughter of the lord of Elea.\u201dMaybe it was uncomfortable for me to talk back clearly, but someone tackled me sharply.\u201cHow dare you. Your Highness\u2026!\u201d\u201cShut up. There is no one here but the royal family who is more noble than me.\u201dI hit back coldly. lifting up a finger\u2019s seal ringThe \u2018royal\u2019 who is more noble than me shut up with a stiff expression. Are you afraid of a dark, evil woman who confronts a white saintess fearlessly?But it\u2019s only the beginning. The blue flame is just burning.\u201cYou mean this is a treat for the aristocrats who follow you when you serve a bad cup of tea? Please come to our marquis. I\u2019ll give you a taste of the finest Louis Voss anytime.\u201d\u201cHestia!\u201dOh, my God. The good saint is screaming\u201cWhat\u2019s so evil about letting the common people use some fragrant soap? What sin is it as a human being to pursue a better life by being faithful to his desires?\u201d\u201cI will never forget this profanity.\u201d\u201cIs it such a big mistake to become an aristocrat by contract marriage? Then can\u2019t those who have lived as nobles even wash away their sins? Oh, by the way, did you repent deeply before God when you became a royal by marriage?\u201d\u201cShut up, Hestia.\u201dIt was Diana, who imitated a fairly solemn royal family. But you were only a commoner not too long ago.\u201cAm I greedy because I became an aristocrat by political marriage? Than the princess who has become a crown princess with only one fiery love.\u201dI let out a cold flame.\u201cYou\u2019re just very lucky.\u201d\u201c!\u201dDiana stood up slowly and caught my eye.Then there was a move that followed. Her hand picked up the cup in front of her.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThere\u2019s tea sprinkled on my face.\u201cMarchioness!\u201d\u201cYour Highness\u2026!\u201dI silently took out my handkerchief. The tea is still hot, maybe because it\u2019s not cool enough.\u201c\u2026\u201dI wiped his tea-stained face without saying a word. I glanced at his forearm. Fortunately, as Tekima said, the temporary tattoo was fine.The surroundings were quiet, as if in cold water.Elegantly, I stood up from my seat. And with the closing comment, I killed her.\u201cNow that I think about it, I\u2019m suddenly curious. Madame Merope, who devoted herself to the imperial family, is now doing where and what\u2026.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201c!\u201dHarmonia and other participants turned pale.Unless you\u2019re a fool, you understand everything I\u2019m saying. Even if you\u2019re loyal to Diana, you\u2019ll be thrown out like Madame Merope.I bowed my knees in a modest manner and took an example.\u201cThank you very much for sharing your honest feelings today. I wish you all the best.\u201dThe answer is useless. I turned my back on her.~~~~\u201c?\u201d\u201c?!\u201dOh, you\u2019re having a hard time today.As soon as I took a few steps to leave the garden, I came across a dark shadow at the entrance.\u201cHestia?\u201d\u201c\u2026Your highness the crown prince.\u201dI held back my distorted face and bowed. Then, I tried to get out of the position quickly.But.\u201cYour clothes are wet\u2026 Your face is a bit red, too.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dI can\u2019t afford to deal with the male lead right now. Even though I look fine, I\u2019m actually completely groggy because of the fiery fight with Diana.At this moment, the voice sounds like a thousand soldiers.\u201cHelios.\u201d\u201c\u2026Diana.\u201dAlright, now.I quickly brushed past her without making eye contact with her.~~~~\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dA long sigh spontaneously broke out in the carriage. Then I laughs and sighs again and again.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dI want to laugh as loud as I want, but I can\u2019t do it well because I\u2019m exhausted.What was the last word that pressed Diana? Oh, was, \u201cYou\u2019re just lucky.\u201d\u201cI was stabbed, and stabbed\u201dIt is certain that she also has a subtle entitlement. In the original story, there is a tea-sprinkling scene that appears only once in front of the villainess, Letona.I tried to gently touch the face that was properly drenched in tea.\u201cOh, my\u2026 It stings a little\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s not a burn. The tea is so cheap that I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll affect my skin.By the way, having stimulated Diana to this extent, there will surely be a backlash later. But there is no need to be scared already.At a time when all of her troops are lost and only Helios has held firmly, is there anything left for Diana to wield?On the other hand, today\u2019s splendid sword dance in front of Diana will bring together anti-Diana aristocrats by word of mouth.After the death of the Duke Orcus, they dare not rebel against the emperor and Helios. But since I\u2019ve caused such a wonderful accident, everyone will come running and hide behind me.I\u2019m good at it, they get the money.The marquis\u2019 wife, a commoner, will take the lead and carry the gun. Then, when the crown princess\u2019 position is shaken, I will quickly insert my supporters into the position.A clear picture. I just laugh.\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dYeah. Honestly, I really don\u2019t care.My ultimate goal is that Diana regrets losing all her people on her side and cry.My real goal is for Diana to kneel down and apologize in front of Kaelus.You\u2019re so lucky that you\u2019ve been walking all along the cider road, and when you\u2019re done with the heroine buff, experience the vacancy Kaelus desperately.Isn\u2019t it \u201cluck\u201d that she was born with the best beauty in the world and suddenly gained healing power? It is because of the generous setting of a \u201cGod\u201d and an \u201cauthor\u201d who did not put any effort into it.Then you should be thankful. You must be deeply humble to the grace given unconditionally.Still, what\u2019s so good, talking to Kaelus about human morality and holding his neck stiff?\u201cIt\u2019s a real war now, Diana. I\u2019ll hit the ground and make you regret it.\u201dI\u2019m a blue flame.I\u2019ll burn everything up for my goal.~~~~As soon as I got home, I wrote to the two sibling models who were in the middle of a soap commercial in Illion.\u201cTo Helena and Pollux\u2026\u201dAt first, I thought about supplying marquis\u2019 soap to the capital here just like Illion. Therefore, they also tried to extend the advertising contract.But I changed my mind after listening to Diana at tea time.The supply soap will be kept exclusively in Illion.Soon the incidence of Illion\u2019s disease will be noticeably reduced. I plan to wait silently until the gap with the capital widens considerably.One more thing. It\u2019s right not to release free soap on purpose, as Diana claims. But the reason is different from her conjecture.You don\u2019t know that it\u2019s precious to get something for nothing. Even at a low price, you feel that it is valuable only when you make them buy it with money.\u201cNow, this time to the soap master\u2026.\u201dI also wrote a letter to a craftsman who developed a method of making low-end soap.Do not manufacture or sell in the capital because the crown princess is displeased.I deliberately used Diana as an excuse. Without having to explain it for a long time, just say that the royal family hates it, and that\u2019s the end of the reason.However, it was decided not to prevent residents of imperial city from purchasing low-end soap distributed in Illion. It would be perfect if Illion is rumored to be a good place to live.If so, how will the temple power of the imperial city be weakened?\u201cYou\u2019ll be pretty busy. To publicise the property disclosure agenda\u2026\u201dOf course, it is not something that can be done immediately. First of all, public opinion should be gathered behind the scenes through Harmonia. It is after public opinion has been formed enough to emerge as an official agenda.And in the meantime, I draw on the corruption of the temple as covertly as I can. We should break bread when it\u2019s crucial, so that people will fall into the temple.\u201cThere\u2019s no place that you can\u2019t brush dust off. Hmph.\u201dA place where people gather somehow creates a stinky corner. Even if he is a priest who should be clean, isn\u2019t he also a man?There must be money spent without explicitly revealing where it was used. Some of the donated goods as relief goods were used privately by the priests. Maybe they had a big get-together with donations.All those petty practices will be arrows that fly in and stick in their bodies. One or two will do. It\u2019s fatal if you get hit in a vital point.\u201cI want you to sink with the temple, Saintess Diana.\u201d~~~~That night, just after dinner with Kaelus, while leisurely drinking coffee, the butler Uross came to my room.\u201cWell, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s late, but we have a visitor.\u201d\u201cReally? Is it Madame Harmonia?\u201d\u201cYes. How did you know?\u201dI was not surprised. After the mess during the day, her seat must\u2019ve felt like thorns.\u201cLet her in.\u201dUross immediately retreated.Soon after, Madame Harmonia appeared after him.\u201cLady Hestia.\u201dAn earthy complexion. She looks like she\u2019s dying.\u201cWelcome, Harmonia.\u201d\u201cLady Marquis, I really don\u2019t know what to say\u2026.\u201d\u201cSit down for now. Haha\u2026.\u201dI laughed deliberately lightly because I felt so sorry for her.I poured coffee before her so that Harmonia could calm down. The butler left the tea behind, but I\u2019d rather just have coffee than the tea I make.She raised her glass with trembling hands. After a careful sip, she let out a long sigh.\u201cI apologize to the marchioness. There\u2019s no excuse.\u201d\u201cWould it be madam\u2019s fault? It\u2019s largely because I couldn\u2019t just accept the crown princess\u2019 provocation.\u201d\u201cEven so, I was the one who insisted on recommending the marchioness, who refused.\u201dHarmonia looked at the glass in her hand mixedly.I smiled bitterly.\u201cMadam. Did you really think that the crown princess would be willing to listen to my advice?\u201d\u201cI believed in her good nature.\u201d\u201cOh, you should\u2019ve considered that she\u2019s a stubborn person.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHarmonia bowed her head.I clicked my tongue.\u201cBut I didn\u2019t expect it either. I didn\u2019t think there was going to be a hasty fight with madam and other young people. But now we need to change that notion.\u201d\u201cSorry, marchioness. It\u2019s my fault.\u201dIt was rather pitiful of her to shrink so much. It doesn\u2019t feel so bad to have this upper hand, but it should be just right.\u201cWell, it\u2019s alright. It\u2019s all in the past. Instead, I attended tea time as madam asked, so she should also keep her promise. Got it?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no question, Hestia.\u201dHarmonia nodded heavily.I chuckled.\u201cBy the way, I ran into the crown prince while I was leaving. What happened after that?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dHarmonia smiled bitterly.\u201cAs expected, he immediately noticed that the atmosphere was in a mess.\u201dHelios came in as soon as I left the sponsorship.[Oh\u2026 It must be a fun tea time.]At his words, the participants bowed their heads in unison, and only Diana looked at Helios with tears in her eyes.[Heli][What\u2019s going on?]The young ladies and Harmonia were hesitant about whether to keep their seats or step aside so that the crown prince and his wife could talk.Then Diana said.[I had an argument with Marchioness Hestia][I\u2019m here after hearing the news. It\u2019s surprising that she\u2019s invited to your tea time.]Harmonia closed her eyes tightly. Diana would have invited Hestia reluctantly at her strong suggestion.Helios looked around carefully and fixed his expression.[It wasn\u2019t a very dignified argument]No wonder, the area around the table was very messy with tea water splashed here and there. This was why Helios came in before the maids had finished organizing.Diana responded coldly.[I know, right. I came here with a lot of effort, but I ended up showing a poor appearance.]Harmonia listened to the conversation between the two with nervousness.Helios also seemed to realize that Diana had become very sharp. Without further ado, he turned back.[Let\u2019s talk again later, Diana.][\u2026.]Diana did not keep him.It was impossible to bring the ruined tea time back together. Harmonia rose cautiously, exchanging glances with the young children.[We\u2019ll be on our way now, your Highness the crown princess.][We\u2019ll see you next time you invite us, your Highness.]They escaped the patronage of the lily palace as if they were running away.Harmonia sighed long again.\u201cPhew\u2026 After that, I led them back to my salon. Because it\u2019s my fault. I forced the marchioness to tea time, so\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not just madam\u2019s fault.\u201dI comforted madam in a gentle tone. She shook her head.\u201cThankfully, they comforted me, too. It was a topic that I brought up to try to change the uncomfortable air, but it ended up getting worse shape.\u201d\u201cYou mean the soap?\u201d\u201cYes, I just thought it was a good thing, and I\u2019ve never thought of it like her highness.\u201dI know. I was surprised, too.How can you find fault with that? Why isn\u2019t it free after selling it at a low price? Oh, my. Oh, my God. She\u2019s just looking for a lot of stuff to bite off.I giggled.\u201cThe crown princess is a person who can\u2019t take me down somehow. To be honest, I\u2019m not surprised to see that kind of person very often.\u201dOf course, the original heroine Diana was not a common kind of human being. In the original work, Diana used to present a \u201ccider\u201d to such vicious people by sticking to one\u2019s \u2018belief\u2019.But I deliberately brought the saintess down to the usual petty human level.She\u2019s no longer the main character, she\u2019s not a saintess.\u201cActually, you\u2019ve been through a lot, madam. A person who is envious of others\u2019 success. To me, the crown princess is just that much.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201d\u201cOf course, she may have been of such a noble character that madam once admired. But people change one day, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHarmonia couldn\u2019t say anything.Now that I\u2019ve made Diana a little jealous, I should make her reasonable doubt a more solid fact.\u201cHarmonia. Why do you think the crown princess is jealous of me?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.\u201dShe couldn\u2019t answer quickly, her face hot. It\u2019s too obvious. And since it\u2019s childish.\u201cBecause I married Kaelus. The crown princess has pushed Kaelus so hard that she still doesn\u2019t want to lose his love.\u201d\u201cLady Marquis\u2026!\u201dI giggled at the shrill Harmonia.\u201cHahaha! Isn\u2019t it so funny? The noble saintess is not satisfied with the best man in this empire.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cShe wants everyone in the world to look only at her. Like a queen bee.\u201dToward the frozen Harmonia, I spoke in a confident tone.\u201cShe\u2019s just a self-loving, up-and-coming commoner. Stop denying the truth, Harmonia.\u201dShe was completely discouraged by my bold remark.\u201cLady Hestia\u2026. Don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re talking to someone else like that..\u201d\u201cOh, no way!\u201dI laughed and waved my hands.\u201cI\u2019m not that stupid. But madam was a witness at tea time today, and she\u2019s a woman I strongly believe in, so I\u2019ve been honest.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you\u2026.\u201dJust in case, let\u2019s make sure she joins.\u201cThat won\u2019t happen again, but please don\u2019t tell anyone about me today.\u201d\u201cDo you mean this, marchioness?\u201dHarmonia bowed her head.I clapped my hands lightly to call attention.\u201cAnyway, I\u2019m sure the young ladies were really surprised because of me today. I\u2019d like to apologize, so could you arrange a table soon?\u201d\u201cOh, marchioness?\u201d\u201cYes, the location is good here, or madam\u2019s salon is good. Or we can have a picnic on a sunny day.\u201dHarmonia smiled faintly at last.\u201cYou\u2019re a desperate woman. Can you go far? If the marquis doesn\u2019t mind, why don\u2019t we have a meeting here?\u201d\u201cOh, good.\u201dComforting those young people who must be fed up with Diana\u2019s cheap tea. Honestly, the taste of the tea I made won\u2019t be comforting, so I\u2019ll have to use quality coffee beans.~~~~The next morning, a letter from Countess Erinnis came in.\u201cWhat? The news is so fast.\u201dAs she boasts web-like connections here and there, yesterday\u2019s tea time seems to have entered her ears. You must have had a connection with someone in attendance.Anyway, I\u2019m a woman who can never let her guard down. Erinnis was another source of tension than dealing with Harmonia.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe content was generally to confirm what happened the day before. It didn\u2019t mean anything bad, but she didn\u2019t dare imagine it.Erinnis said that the young ladies were amazed at how boldly I faced Diana. She didn\u2019t really need to sugarcoat or hide it, so I mostly admitted it.I wrote back with a sneer of laughter.\u201cI wanted to approach young girls more sympathetically, but I was wrong, Erinnis.\u201dMaybe she\u2019ll find out what I mean by this line. I will put my dissatisfaction with Diana on the surface in front of the captivated young ladies and praise myself as an adult who can bravely step forward.At the end of the sentence, I wrote that I was going to invite the greatly surprised young ladies to the marquis and soothe them, and sealed the letter tightly.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dNow I\u2019ve lit the spark. When it starts to burn in earnest, even the great male lead will be unable to stop it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 25": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA few days had passed since the day of the fight with Diana. It was the day that Kaelus returns to the cabinet meetings after a long time.I\u2019m worried, but on the other hand, I\u2019m thrilled. It is proof that his mental illness, which he had been suffering from, has healed to some extent.I was busy early in the morning with my butler Uross and maid Clarice.\u201cI\u2019ll put all the necessary documents in this bag.\u201d\u201cThe emergency medicine is in the inside pocket of the outerwear.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re in a hurry to find me, please come out of the meeting right away. I\u2019ll be waiting.\u201dAt my pouring request, Kaelus said with a chuckle.\u201cIt\u2019s like putting a baby in the water.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201dA suit of dark gray, long silvery hair tied neatly. The appearance of my favorite, often depicted in the original, was reproduced in front of my eyes.Tears welled up for some reason.\u201cI\u2019m all set.\u201dCool and beautiful. My favorite is the most handsome in the world.Since I decided to go to the conference hall with Kaelus, I was dressed formally.However, I decorated it as simple as possible so that my existence does not stand out more than Kaelus. To the point where people will think I\u2019m not a spouse but a secretary.But that was exactly what I intended. That\u2019s just enough for my role today.~~~~In front of the Lion Palace where the cabinet meeting were held. The carriage with the marquis\u2019s writing on it stopped.Outside the palace, there were people who spent their free time before the meeting began.As soon as I opened the carriage door, I heard a buzz.\u201cNo way, was the rumor true?\u201d\u201cIs the marquis really back?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 I\u2019m relieved. Sincerely\u2026.\u201dI tried to reach out to Kaelus with a casual face.\u201cEveryone is surprised.\u201d\u201cHmph.\u201dKaelus\u2019 finger touched my hand lightly.When he got off completely, he walked straight to the entrance of the Lion Palace. I followed him with a veil over my face.Originally, it was the emperor who presided over the cabinet meeting. But the emperor stepped down under the pretext of the crown prince\u2019s political lessons \u2013 of course the truth was revealed.Therefore, the chairman of the meeting was Prince Helios.\u201cThere will be no major discussion on the agenda today. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a sudden agenda.\u201d\u201cYes, and don\u2019t bring up the prophecy that I told you beforehand.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201dKaelus and I walked down the hall and exchanged briefly.There was still time left. However, Kaelus did not seem to have any intention of relaxing outside. As soon as he arrived in front of the conference hall, he turned to me.\u201cI\u2019ll go in.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll wait here.\u201dAlthough there is a separate space for secretaries to stay, I decided not to. If Kaelus had difficulty breathing or dizziness, I have to run immediately.I stood timidly beside the stern guards. I don\u2019t know how much longer I\u2019ll have to stand like this. Still, I was willing to endure it.After a while, Helios surrounded by guards appeared with the sound of footsteps.\u201c\u2026.\u201dFollowing the courteous escorts, I also bowed my head with a veil down.\u201c\u2026?\u201dSuddenly, the shadow stopped in front of me. Please just walk by. please.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dA grotesque sigh.However, Helios did not pretend to know me and went straight into the conference hall.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI was a little relieved.~~~~The Cabinet meeting lasted for hours.The royal servant who recognized me approached and asked.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you take a break in the lounge for a while? I don\u2019t know when the meeting will end\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. This is more comfortable.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dThe servant looked troubled, and soon accepted my wish and withdrew.In fact, there are often cases where a secretary of nobility does this. However, this is rarely done by the aristocrats themselves. So I wanted to keep quiet without revealing my identity.However, wherever you go, there are people who want to touch people who stay still.\u201cAre you, by any chance, Marchioness Hestia?\u201dAnother carefully approached which made me sigh inwardly.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201dThe way I spoke was polite, but my whole body was full of feisty air. Then the other person shrank even more.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt. Baroness Potos told me to deliver this letter.\u201d\u201c?\u201dBaron Potos. In the original, he was one of the aristocratic extras who just passed me by name. But the reason I remember the name is not because of the original.There was a time when the novel ended and after Kaelus died, I worked at random for a living until I returned.I had no desire to live, but I did not have the courage to die on my own like Kaelus, so I endured life without meaning. At the same time, in spite of the loss of my favorite, I frantically collected the backstories of Helios and Diana.One incident that was heard in the midst of that. A merchant ship owned by Baron Potos was sunk by a storm.Numerous nobles invested in the trade goods carried by merchant ships and lost a lot of money. However, the bigger problem was that the baron family, who learned the news a step earlier, ran away at night.How famous Baron Potos\u2019s night flight was, I heard it often enough to get a scab on my ear while washing dishes in a noble family.The baron\u2019s family consisted of a baroness, his son and daughter, in addition to the baron himself. In particular, Diocke, the Baron\u2019s daughter, was busy coming and going to the imperial palace as the Baron\u2019s aide.However, there was a separate purpose for Diocke to follow the baron. Baron Potos\u2019s real intention was to put Diocke in the eyes of the crown prince, instead of Princess Diana, whose position was shaken.However, his ambition sank with the sinking of the merchant ship. I haven\u2019t heard about them since.\u201cIf it\u2019s to Marquis Kaelus, I\u2019ll take it for now. He\u2019ll give a reply to you later.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you.\u201dThe servant soon disappeared.I looked at the letter in my hand for a while.A message from Baron Potos. It wouldn\u2019t matter because Kaelus allowed me to look at most invitations first.I came a short distance from the conference hall, and quietly opened the envelope.There is a string of rhetoric, but it is simple to sum up. \u2018Let\u2019s eat together.\u2019Compared to the invitations that have been received from countless marquis, it was a dinner invitation that was not very special. This time, however, I decided not to ignore it at my discretion, but to listen to Kaelus\u2019 opinion for now.Because he had to foretell that his merchant ship would sink and investors would lose a lot of money.If you take advantage of this point, you may be able to make the situation favorable.\u201cThe Baron Potos\u2026\u201dFirst of all, I\u2019ll have to look into the details of the merchant ship.~~~~Soon the door of the conference hall, which had been tightly closed, opened wide. The first person to come out of the door was Prince Helios.\u201c\u2026\u201dI met his eyes for a moment. But he just passed by.Soon after, with the tired aristocrats coming out of the long cabinet meeting like ghosts.\u201c\u2026!\u201dMy favorite, who walked slowly, left the conference hall at the end.I hurried up.\u201cKaelus!\u201d\u201c\u2026Hestia.\u201dKaelus looked at me with a pretty exhausted look.Ah, this is how parents feel when they see their children who took the CSAT for hours. Tears welled up.\u201cYou must have had a hard time, right? Let\u2019s go back.\u201d\u201cYeah, I think I\u2019d like to take a rest.\u201dI quickly took the briefcase that Kaelus had in his hand. You should return home quickly before your mental strength falls to the floor due to a sharp decline in physical strength.I was in a hurry, so my body kept going out first. I grabbed Kaelus\u2019s hand, who was walking slowly, without realizing it.\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dOh, my.I let go reflexively.Kaelus\u2019 purple eyes narrowed.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Without realizing it\u2026.\u201dI bowed my head in embarrassment.In the twinkling of silence.\u201c\u2026I think I need some help.\u201d\u201c?!\u201dI doubted my ears. He raised his head.His usual dry eyes stared at me.\u201cStretch out your arm.\u201d\u201c!\u201dIs this a dream or real life? Kaelus asked me to reach out my arm first!I think there are too many lucky days these days. Can a fan be like this? It is widely believed that a maniac can\u2019t win the lottery.Oh, maybe it\u2019s because this is a novel, not a reality. That\u2019s why author\u2019s law doesn\u2019t apply.I see. I guess that\u2019s why.\u201c\u2026Yes!\u201dI tried my best not to shake my voice.A warm weight was placed on the arm that hesitated. Cool, warm, and thrilling body temperature.\u201cCome on, Kaelus.\u201dI kept pace with his slow pace.A strange sensation that seems to have slowed down even the flow of time.Am I breathing? Am I moving forward?\u201c\u2026\u201dA smile naturally spread inside the veil covering the face. I bowed my head slightly and hid my expression completely.The marquis\u2019 carriage was waiting in advance in front of the Lion Palace. Kaelus leaned on my arm and climbed cautiously onto the carriage.\u201cSleep for a moment.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dMy favorite closed his eyes with a drooping answer.I swept my arm unnoticed by him. The weight still lingers like a hallucination.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI should calm down first when I get home.~~~~After returning home from the cabinet meeting, Kaelus had to rest the whole time. Therefore, the letter about Baron Potos was not received until the next day.\u201cWhen I was at the Lion Palace yesterday, the servant gave it to me.\u201dI handed over the baron\u2019s invitation to dinner in an envelope.Sitting languidly on the sofa, he picked up the letter with a rather insincere movement.\u201cDinner? Why are you showing me this?\u201dNo wonder he is wondering. This is because I have rejected most of these invitations.The condition of Kaelus was also worrisome, and there was also a reason why the intention they invited was too obvious. In short, there was no need to struggle with the meeting that was not very nutritious.Baron Potos\u2019 invitation to dinner was similar at first glance. So I revealed the hidden circumstances to Kaelus.\u201cIt\u2019s a little special this time. You know Baron Potos owns a merchant ship to and from another country, right?\u201cYeah, but?\u201d\u201cThe merchant ship will sink.\u201d\u201cWhoa.\u201dKaelus sat up slightly from his limp body.I went on and on.\u201cI don\u2019t know the exact date, but in the next year, the merchant ship will meet a storm and sink. The aristocrats who invested in merchant ships would lose a lot.\u201d\u201cIt must be the same for the baron himself.\u201d\u201cYes. The problem is that the baron family, instead of paying off their debts, runs away.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dKaelus looked at me in a ridiculous way.\u201cHe\u2019s a person who doesn\u2019t even have basic decency.\u201d\u201cYes, but if you meet him and find out about the investors, you can save the people who will suffer if you can\u2019t stop the merchant ship sinking.\u201dBut he shook his head with excitement.\u201cEveryone has to take the risks of investing. You don\u2019t have to use your prophecy to stop it.\u201dAs expected, my bias is cold. It\u2019s not like I\u2019ve stopped admiring that cold charm.In the end, I shrugged my shoulders and confessed my true intentions.\u201cPhew, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I want to get information from the investors that Baron Potos has. I think you can use it to your advantage.\u201dOnly then did Kaelus\u2019 expression slightly loosen.\u201cOh, was that what you meant?\u201d\u201cIn fact, there is no excuse to stop people from investing in merchant ships. I can\u2019t even say I saw a prophecy.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThere will be people who will lose money, but it\u2019s enough for me if I know who the investors are.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe thought for a moment with his eyes down, and soon raised the corners of his mouth faintly.\u201cI\u2019ll accept the invitation. It\u2019s not difficult. You may reply that I will go.\u201d\u201cOh, thank you!\u201dI didn\u2019t think you\u2019d accept it so soon!I couldn\u2019t help but be genuinely grateful.\u201cI won\u2019t forget your help, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to thank me so much for everything. Because I got a lot of help from you.\u201dHe murmured like a sigh.But I\u2019m already at the maximum level of excitement!\u201cHa ha, thank you for being so helpful. I mean it.\u201dWith my words that did not hide my joy,\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus turned his eyes away.Isn\u2019t that cute? That cold-hearted favorite is not good at saying thank you.~~~~It was a simple meal, so less than three days after exchanging letters, Kaelus and I sat down at Baron Potos\u2019 dinner table.\u201cOh, it\u2019s an honor to have you here, Marquis Kaelus!\u201dThe barons greeted us groveling to the point where we thought it was an exaggeration.No, to be exact, Kaelus.When I stepped into this mansion and saw the attitude of these families, I realized for sure.The real purpose of their attempt to invite the marquis, or Kaelus, to dinner was to present their daughter, Diocke.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI was so speechless.It\u2019s a dinner invitation that I asked for, but it\u2019s grossly unpleasant.I remember Baron Potos being so obnoxious to Helios before he returned and bringing in his daughter. But this time it\u2019s not Helios, it\u2019s Kaelus!The saying that personality doesn\u2019t go anywhere is just right. I must have looked very funny because I was a commoner marquis wife. I thought I had a place in society in my own way, but nevertheless, there are always people who look down on me like this.Even Diana, the commoner crown princess, looked down on me.Now that I\u2019ve been treated like this, I can\u2019t just eat. Be prepared to scratch off what you want with just one meeting today*, Baron Potos.*TN: just forget what he was planning due to this rude meetingDiocke, who pretended to be innocent, grabbed the hem of her dress brilliantly and bent her knees.\u201cI\u2019m relieved to see you recover, Lord Kaelus. Please enjoy your time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus is indeed the coolest man in the empire. Diocke is just looking down with a cold gaze.We were guided by the baroness and headed for the glorious dining hall.Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s a house that owns a boat, but they just splashed money everywhere in the house. That\u2019s not even close to the income of Kaelus, who owns the Illion estate.As we sat down at the table, the maids quickly carried the dishes.The barons talked about their personal affairs and their recent status. Since the purpose of the event was \u2018How about my daughter as a second bride?\u2019 He seemed to be trying to go in a light atmosphere as much as possible.\u201cI was so happy to hear that you were back at the cabinet meeting, marquis.\u201d\u201cYeah. Now you seemed to have a good mind, so we were relieved.\u201dThe baron and the baroness spoke with great tenderness.But my favorite asked in a very businesslike tone, after casually raising his head once.\u201cBy the way, when will the next merchant ship depart?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 our merchant ship, you mean\u2026?\u201dThe barons looked at each other and then turned to Kaelus again.\u201cIf you buy the goods with investment money and ship them\u2026. Will you leave soon?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think the exact date of departure has been decided yet.\u201dSuch a sloppy answer did not work for Kaelus. The baron managed to smile in embarrassment.\u201cSorry, yes. We haven\u2019t got all the money yet\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to be impatient. Marquis, it hasn\u2019t been long since my last voyage.\u201dThe baroness quickly added.Diocke tried to cut off the topic of conversation properly.\u201cCome to think of it, you look a little thinner than before.\u201dOh, it\u2019s not a bad start. Come on, Diocke.\u201cIs that so?\u201dA snapped answer. Oops, Miss Diocke. I think you\u2019ve failed.Kaelus slipped the ball to me.\u201cHestia, didn\u2019t you say you were interested in the merchant ship of the Potos?\u201d\u201cOh, yes, I did.\u201dWow. I\u2019m so happy to have a partner who\u2019s in sync.I looked at the baron with a grin.\u201cI\u2019m surprised you haven\u2019t collected all the money yet. I understand that the baron\u2019s investment in merchant ships is quite creditworthy.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dOnly then did the baron realize that I had the initiative in this meeting, not Kaelus.After exchanging significant glances with the baroness.\u201cIn fact, in terms of the size of the funds, we\u2019ve gathered around the same level as our last departure. But wouldn\u2019t it take some time because the project we\u2019re planning is bigger?\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201d\u201cYes, we\u2019re looking to recruit new investors as well as those who have invested steadily. Is the marchioness interested?\u201dAt the baron\u2019s question, I blushed shyly as if I had been caught in my innermost thoughts.\u201cI heard there\u2019s a lot of net profit left.\u201d\u201cHahaha, that\u2019s just nagging.\u201dThe baron is trying to lure me into a new investment \u2013 a prey \u2013 and I\u2019m trying to dig up information about investors from him.We\u2019re going to hide our true feelings and throw bait to get what we want.\u201cIf Lady Marquis invests, we will give you at least twice as much profit.\u201d\u201cOh, does business work the way you want it to? Double the bottom line, it\u2019s like a dream.\u201dEven in modern times, revenue-guaranteed transactions are fraudulent or illegal. You have to apply the brake once here.When I slipped back, the baroness joined the war.\u201cThat means it\u2019s a safe business. And if you\u2019re a high-ranking aristocrat like a marquis, you deserve it.\u201d\u201cWell, then\u2026.\u201dI blurted out the end of my speech as if I were hesitant. Then I turned to Kaelus.\u201cKaelus. Well, the investment is\u2026\u201d\u201cDo as you please. I\u2019ll add more if it\u2019s not enough.\u201dThe barons looked rather surprised. It seems quite strange that Kaelus supports me firmly.There\u2019s only one person here who\u2019s not happy. Diocke has a bitter look on her face. I think you wanted us to be a show window couple*.*TN: just for show, not a partnershipThe son of the baron couple, who had been quiet all along, finally stepped in.\u201cThe bigger the seed money, the better. You have to bury a lot of money to make a big profit.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dI snorted inwardly, pretending to be troubled.Before returning, I think I know why these noblemen ran away at night.They raised funds and launched a merchant ship, but it sank into the water, and their daughter was not a princess in place of Diana.Since the merchant ship had completely disappeared, it was just lost. There was nothing left anyway, so it wouldn\u2019t matter if they threw it all away and ran away.Anyway, I don\u2019t have a good heart to tell them the impending disasters.Let\u2019s put a stop to it and stick to my purpose.\u201cIt\u2019s worth thinking about investing a lot of money. By the way, Baron Potos.\u201dWhen I spoke softly, the baron\u2019s upper body came forward.\u201cYes, go ahead, marchioness.\u201d\u201cMay I know what kind of people invested in merchant ships? I think I\u2019d be pretty sold if someone reliable had invested.\u201dLet\u2019s see how the baron will react.\u201cOh\u2026 the names of the investors?\u201dThe baron asked back rather than embarrassed.\u201cRight, you said the amount of money you\u2019ve raised is similar to the last time, so I wonder if the investors are the same people.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026 Well, you\u2019re asking for some pretty sensitive information\u2026\u201dThe baron rolled his eyes and looked at the baroness. The baroness was also reluctant.\u201cSome of the investors asked me not to identify them. If we don\u2019t want to lose our credibility, we can\u2019t help it\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s harder than I thought. But if you\u2019re a businessman, you have to put up a barrier like this. Rotten apple.Therefore, a stronger weapon was prepared to break through this iron wall.\u201cIf you provide me with information, I\u2019ll invest at a price that you won\u2019t regret. Of course, we will do our best to secure the information.\u201dKaelus added immediately to my words.\u201cI guarantee what my wife says. Or, if you don\u2019t trust our investment commitment, we can do a little bit of a pre-investment here.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh, marquis\u2026.\u201dThe baron couple\u2019s eyes glistened.In the meantime, my heart fluttered and I clenched my fist secretly.Did you hear that? Kaelus guaranteed me!What is one of the moments where words make your blood rush to your ear? I mean, you don\u2019t ever stand up for other people\u2019s guarantees!But my favorite did the hard thing.\u201cKael\u2026.\u201dMy voice trembled with emotion.\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus raised only the glass of wine with an insignificant face.That indifferent response drives people crazy. That\u2019s really mean. amazing.Baron Potos was greatly pleased.\u201cIf Marquis Kaelus says so\u2026.\u201dThe baron\u2019s son was instructed by the baron and hurried out. And after a while, he came back with a folded envelope.\u201cI\u2019ll really just give you the name, except for the investment, Marchioness Hestia.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s enough.\u201dThings went so easily that I was rather dumbfounded.All thanks to Kaelus\u2019 solid support. To be honest, I didn\u2019t do much.In the first place, Kaelus accepted this unnecessary invitation only for my needs. I received unspeakable help.My life goal of making him happy is burning more and more. I have to do my best.Anyway, after I got what I wanted, I was quite relaxed. The only thing left is to eat deliciously.And Diocke must have thought the same thing.\u201cNow that we\u2019re done talking about business, I think we can talk about something light.\u201dThe baroness and her brother also responded.\u201cHaha, I know. This is also to celebrate the marquis\u2019 complete recovery!\u201dCongratulations on your recovery. You\u2019re not showing off your daughter?I swallowed my laughter inside and smiled with dignity on the outside. Anyway, rice is innocent, and I\u2019m ready to eat deliciously.Diocke kept talking about this and that to get Kaelus\u2019 attention. But each time, Kaelus consistently gave short answers of no more than five syllables, disappointing the barons.\u201c\u2026.\u201dWatching the scene, I suddenly thought a lot of thoughts.It\u2019s already been months since I married Kaelus. Before returning, I lived for about two more years after the end of the novel, so if there is no big change, I have a little more than a year left in the world.Of course, that weak Baron Potos won\u2019t be the father-in-law of Kaelus, but I hope that Kaelus will have a place to mind after I leave, even if it\u2019s not necessarily Diocke.Well, Diana could come back to Kaelus\u2019 heart. But until she sincerely kneels down before him and regrets, Kaelus will not be so thirsty as before to remove his liver and gallbladder. He\u2019ll look at her with more lukewarm feelings than the first time.Frankly, I have doubts. Can Kaelus love a woman other than Diana?Isn\u2019t there a saying like that? You can\u2019t forget your first love until you die. Even if it\u2019s not that, Kaelus\u2019 position in the original work was a tragic second lead looking at \u201clove that can\u2019t be achieved forever.\u201dOr even if he falls in love, he\u2019ll try to find a woman that resembles Diana in that new \u201clove.\u201dOf course, now that the novel is over, connecting Kaelus and Diana may be a little bit unlikely.However, once his image is in my head so is Diana, I keep connecting her to Kaelus. It is by no means a good habit.\u201cLord Kaelus. This souffle is our chef\u2019s specialty. It\u2019s really good.\u201dDiocke tried to slide in tirelessly.\u201cI see.\u201dKaelus also firmly stuck to the short answers.I feel rather sorry for her at this point. Indeed, Kaelus was a sweet-looking man only for Diana. I guess this setting doesn\u2019t change.But on the other hand, Diocke is truly a brave woman.How dare you seduce a man who has a tumultuous love triangle with the current crown prince and his wife in the past, even though it is a contract marriage, in front of his formal spouse. Whatever else, I should at least acknowledge that spirit.I took advantage of the opportunity to take advantage of the opportunity to save Diocke and end the boring meeting.\u201cI\u2019ve got to go back now. I lost track of time while talking.\u201d\u201cShall we?\u201dKaelus kept a cold expressionless face until the end, even though it may sound very welcome.Baron Potos bowed very politely to me and Kaelus, who had become \u2018big hands\u2019 customers.\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon, marquis, marchioness.\u201dHe seems to really believe that I will invest a lot of money.I replied with an elegant smile.\u201cYes, I look forward to seeing you again, baron.\u201d~~~~When the carriage door closed completely, we sighed almost simultaneously.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dThe sound made me giggle.\u201cYou did a great job, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re the one.\u201dKaelus shook his head. He blocked Diocke\u2019s wave attack with a short answer like a knife, and seems to have consumed his physical strength unseen.I thanked him from the bottom of my heart.\u201cThank you for supporting me in front of the barons. Thanks to you, I achieved my goal so easily that I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to the help I\u2019ve received from you.\u201d\u201cOh, I didn\u2019t help you to get anything in return. I just did it because I wanted to.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s say I\u2019m the same.\u201dWithout losing, Kaelus replied.Somehow I felt warm inside my heart. Even if I speak so calmly, I can feel that he is truly grateful to me.Instead of opening my mouth more, I smiled shyly at him. The purple eyes that look at me are also slightly bent.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dFor such a short time, we exchanged glances without saying a word.I thought my face would be heated if I looked at it longer, so I quickly closed my eyes and looked for my handbag.\u201cOh, where\u2019s the envelope that my Baron\u2019s son brought me\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, Hess\u2026\u201dI eagerly pretended not to know Kaelus\u2019 voice, which seemed to be somewhat despondent.An envelope that is quietly placed in a handbag. I\u2019m saved! I can break this strange, tickling atmosphere with this!\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThere were no particular remarkable details in the neatly written names in the envelopes.I handed the list to Kaelus.\u201cThe list of investors is normal. It contains all the names of the most powerful nobles in the capital.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve been through a lot, that\u2019s a shame.\u201dI shook my head softly at his words.\u201cBut I didn\u2019t suffer for nothing. We know who the other people are who didn\u2019t invest.\u201dBaron Potos said he was definitely looking for new investors besides them.So I can use this list to choose who to rescue or push into the abyss.First, I asked Kaelus.\u201cAre there any of these investors that you want to save?\u201d\u201cWell, not really.\u201dA dry answer. It really doesn\u2019t seem to exist. Then I guess there\u2019s no one I should pay particular attention to.Then, suddenly, a question came in.\u201cAre you going to tell him about the merchant ship?\u201d\u201cWell, there\u2019s no particular reason to hide it\u2026.\u201dHowever, I don\u2019t want to let him know quickly.But\u2026\u201c\u2026As long as I get the right timing\u2026.\u201d\u201c?\u201dI spoke to myself without realizing it.Kaelus looked at me in wonder.I chuckled.\u201cEven if I do the same thing, the effect depends on how I get the timing right.\u201dI have to tell Helios that the merchant ship will sink.However, I decide the timing. In the best interests of Kaelus and I.~~~~The fact that the marquis has returned to politics has two great meanings.The first is that his mental illness has recovered and his daily life has been restored.. And secondly, inevitably, he had to have frequent encounters with Helios.Helios is another party that drove Kaelus to a dead end. But without any protection, Kaelus has to face him in this dog-like situation.However, isn\u2019t there a limit to following and protecting your favorite person? The rest must be trusted by Kaelus*. Otherwise, he\u2019ll be offended by the overprotective protection against him.*TN: she needs to trust that he can handle it or he\u2019ll be offendedI spoke to Kaelus who was getting ready to go to the imperial palace.\u201cAs you watch the story progress, please pass on this prophecy to the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cProphecy?\u201dKaelus stopped trying to tie his tie and picked up the envelope I had put out.\u201cYes, it\u2019s the kingdom\u2019s war threat you\u2019ve been preparing for.\u201d\u201cOh, I see. Is it time?\u201dI nodded my head.\u201cYou\u2019ll see some signs. You should point out the signs to the crown prince without passing on them.\u201dObviously others would think that the kingdom is sending troops to deal with nomadic tribes on the border, as it has always been.Once the imperial emperor is notified under this pretext, it has the effect of not being recognized as a significant threat. Therefore, even if it feels that the enemy\u2019s troops are larger than usual at the border, no special preparation will be made.If Kaelus has to face Helios inevitably, it would be better to discuss such a major national event. Don\u2019t let him talk about his personal affairs unnecessarily.Still, I added a word to my own selfishness.\u201cIf the crown prince tries to talk about something personal, just say no and come out. You can do that in your own right?\u201dKaelus replied lightly.\u201cI see, but I can\u2019t do anything if he gives me orders again.\u201d\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t do that again, would he? I\u2019ve told him before, so that\u2019s\u2026.\u201dAt the end, however, I blurted out my words without confidence.Frankly, there is no reason not to do so again. He had a history of trying to break into a secret library.\u201cHeh. If I respond appropriately, there\u2019s no problem. Don\u2019t worry.\u201dKaelus replied with a snort.I hope you come back safely.~~~~While Kaelus went out to the palace, I received a letter from Countess Erinnis.And soon I was in a daze.\u201cWhat a ridiculous person!!\u201dWhat a cheap mouth the Baron Potos has!No, I didn\u2019t express my intention to invest with certainty, but he\u2019s already bragging here and there that I\u2019ve decided to invest in merchant ships!In fact, it\u2019s not a bad way to do it just by sales strategy. For those who need to recruit new investors quickly, the fact that the marquis and his wife expressed their willingness to invest at dinner has an advertising effect in themselves.However, the person involved is not feeling too good to be talked about in this way.\u201cThey\u2019re drinking kimchi soup first*. Really\u2026\u2026!\u201d*TN: idiom to count one\u2019s chickens before they hatch (i.e getting ahead of themselves)I immediately wrote back to Erinnis.\u201cThank you for letting me know\u2026 By the way, do you know anything about the barons?\u2026 In fact, at dinner\u2026.\u201dAn eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth.If the barons are selling me this way, I can set fire the same. Spreading the hidden ambitions of those humans all over the world.What to say to Erinnis is simple. The baron family tried to get to the throne and the marquis\u2019 seat with Diocke at the forefront. Maybe it\u2019s because we\u2019re both commoners and easy. What does she usually say and do at social gatherings?\u201cWell, you\u2019ve touched the wrong person.\u201dWhat if I throw this bait to Erinnis? I can already see it. She is anxious to shake her mouth off to her close friends*.*TN: eager to gossipThen, I wrote another letter. This time it was for Baron Potos himself.\u201cI\u2019m indescribably disappointed by the baron\u2019s hasty words and actions\u2026.\u201dYou\u2019re asking me to be concerned about security.There are so many people in the world who are generous to themselves.**TN: only think about themselvesI threatened to withdraw my investment intention if the rumors spread further, and sent this letter to the baron.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI cooled down, fanning my hot face.Now we have to think about the future.Unless he is a fool, the baron will flinch and try to pick up the words he uttered back. At the same time, he will try to patch up Diocke\u2019s rumors. That\u2019s Diocke\u2019s sullen ambition, which I spilled a while ago through Erinnis.\u201cHmm. It could be useful somewhere.\u201dA\u00a0 self-contained victory.I\u2019m talking about Baron Potos\u2019 family, who was trying to use me.I spread the list of investments in the Potos merchant ship along with the fanatic note. With the tip of a pen, I tapped between the two and went back and forth, thinking deeply.Investors, or those who didn\u2019t invest.Marchioness Hestia, who thought she had invested but didn\u2019t.I put some important keywords and put them together here and there, and soon something began to be caught faintly.\u201cOh, if I do this\u2026.\u201dI scribbled the scenario briefly on a fanatic note.One scene. Baron Potos hurriedly corrects the marquis\u2019 wife\u2019s investment in merchant ships..Scene two. The prospective investors who thought I was investing turn their back on it.Scene three. Business in trouble. Baron wants me to step up and appease potential customers. In addition, they ask me to collect rumors about Diocke.Scene 4. Then I accept his request conditionally.\u201cConditions\u2026 What conditions\u2026?\u201dI chewed the tip of the pen as I now had a habit. Now, how are you going to be useful, Baron Potos.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAt that moment, there was a keyword that suddenly caught my eye.\u201cThose who didn\u2019t invest\u2026!\u201dIt\u2019s a baron\u2019s merchant ship that\u2019s about to sink. Therefore, investors will lose a lot of money sooner or later, and those who do not invest will be able to preserve their assets.So what if you make someone invest here who hasn\u2019t decided yet?\u201cHahaha\u2026 Diana\u2026.\u201dI laughed with a somber sound.I set my terms in favor of the baron. Making Diana invest in his merchant ship.Humming, I hummed in my fan\u2019s notebook.Scene 5. Under my terms, the baron attracts Diana as an investor.The details need to be more refined, but the approximate scenario is complete.From one scene to four scenes, it seems that it will proceed smoothly without any special behind-the-scenes work.The problem is scene five.Baron Potos and his daughter Diocke are ambitious but not very clever. In addition, Dianna is famous for not listening to other people\u2019s words even if she dies.Therefore, it is almost impossible to persuade Diana entirely with their own power. I have to do some basic work to make things easier.\u201cShould I see Helios after all? It\u2019s no big deal.\u201dAn uncomfortable encounter with Helios. But if you want to catch a tiger, shouldn\u2019t you go into a tiger\u2019s den?I flicked my tongue out a new piece of letter paper and envelope. The same one I gave to Kaelus earlier.The so-called prophecy-only envelope. It was a high-end letter paper used only to give prophecies to Helios.My prediction for writing here is none other than Baron Potos\u2019s sinking of a merchant ship.It\u2019s easy to think that I have to hide it to persuade Diana to invest, but it\u2019s the opposite. It is better to use Diana\u2019s psychology in reverse.Helios has faith in my prophecies anyway. But Diana does not.Diana\u2019s distrust of me must have been very extreme, having already had a big fight at tea time not too long ago.Even if she believes in the prophecy to some extent, if she hears this prophecy from Helios\u2019 mouth, she will try to do the opposite of my prophecy.Why? Because if you give up your investment, you\u2019ll admit to what I\u2019m saying!Diana wouldn\u2019t want to look like she\u2019s quitting her investment because of my words even if she dies soon. Especially for Helios.I diligently teased my pen.\u201cThere\u2019s no use trying to be proud\u2026.\u201dI completed his wisdom by muttering. Baron Potos\u2019 merchant ship will sink.\u2019Sooner or later, there may be another fight between husband and wife. Diana\u2019s investment? It doesn\u2019t matter if it actually happens.The real point is that this will make Diana and Helios irrevocably distant. And that brings Diana back to her fond memories of Kaelus.Arrogant heroine, Diana.I hope you regret it and regret it again.I want you to look back desperately on who you owe it to for walking on the cider Road.I hope you realize what it was like to throw it away coldly to choose Helios and hit the ground belatedly.I resent your life for living without rough ups and downs.And curse your god who made you do that.\u201c\u2026 The novel is over now.\u201dIsn\u2019t the world outside the original a playground for fans? Something like that that\u2019s perfect for enthusiastic readers like me to create a secondary one.\u201cDiana, do you know who your god is? Do you think he knows better than me?\u201dI snorted.Knowing the secrets of the created world is truly a tremendous power.I will use this power only for the happiness of Kaelus.For my derelict favorite.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was his first time going out alone without me, and it was almost a perfect outing.The butler retreated quietly so that Kaelus and I could be alone. I thanked him with a wink and followed Kaelus to the room.\u201cWhat did the prince say?\u201d\u201cHe was a little surprised.\u201dKaelus sank down on the sofa. I asked questions over and over again, but diligently hung his coat, and brought the bag back to its place.\u201cAnything else about the prophecy?\u201d\u201cHe said he\u2019d have to call you in person for a detailed explanation sooner or later\u201dSlowly raising his upper body, he picked up a teapot on the table.\u201cHe didn\u2019t reprimand me?\u201d\u201cThere was no mention of you. Just asked me, \u2018Was it because of this that you wanted to come back quickly\u2026\u2019 \u201dI took a sip of the tea he poured me.\u201cSo, how did you respond?\u201d\u201cI just said yes.\u201dKaelus chuckled.\u201cAs you say, I pointed out a number of signs that he might have overlooked, and it was quiet.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dDid you admire Kaelus\u2019s sharp insight?This time I asked what I was worried about the whole time.\u201cThe crown prince didn\u2019t call you a friend again, did he?\u201dThen Kaelus put on a bitter look.\u201cI did want to say something. But I didn\u2019t say it out loud.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure he was going to complain that he had no one to open up to.\u201dAt my cynical retort, he tilted his head to the side.\u201cIs there a possibility its something else?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dI was embarrassed at the sudden question.Kaelus said with his usual dry face.\u201cI\u2019m saying this because I think too simply of Helios.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI was caught off guard and couldn\u2019t say anything.To be honest, I think I know Helios as well as Kaelus. I thought that I almost understood the character\u2019s personality and state of mind while binge-reading the original novel nine times.However, the original does not describe every moment of Helios or Kaelus\u2019 life in detail. It\u2019s something only they know that lives directly in this world.Like he doesn\u2019t know everything about Helios, neither do I.So what Kaelus says makes sense to some extent.\u201c\u2026You may be right.\u201dI bowed my head.Kaelus quietly put down the teacup.\u201cBut I\u2019d like to talk about something else this time.\u201d\u201cAnything else?\u201dI asked back in wonder. This is because it is quite rare that Kaelus has something to say first.His expression was somewhat serious. I was even more nervous.Heart pounding like a child on the verge of being scolded and waiting for his mouth to open again.\u201c\u2026I need to take a nap first.\u201d\u201cEh\u2026?\u201dKaelus slowly got up and crawled into the bed.\u201c\u2026\u201dIf you want to say it, you can say it quickly, or you can say it later! Where did you learn how to be at ease like that?I don\u2019t know why, but it\u2019s unfair.But my favorite needs to sleep well, so I need to walk quietly so that he doesn\u2019t hear footsteps.~~~~While Kaelus sighed, I returned to my room and panicked alone.\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dWhat the hell is there to talk about?I\u2019m so curious that I\u2019m going crazy because I\u2019m dying to know. I want to remove the blanket, shouting out, \u2018Is it time to sleep now?\u2019When I sit still, all sorts of thoughts pop into my head. Is it a territorial internal affairs issue? Is he talking about divorce? Did he find out that I\u2019m not really a prophet? Is he trying to tell me to stop harassing Diana and Helios?It\u2019s all negative anyway. That\u2019s why I\u2019m more anxious.I took a deep breath and pulled myself together.\u201cPhew\u2026 yes. It doesn\u2019t matter what it is\u2026.\u201dLet\u2019s blow away the unprovoked anxiety with a long breath.There\u2019s no need to be nervous. If Kaelus says he doesn\u2019t want me around anymore, it\u2019s enough to leave without hesitation.I made up my mind from the beginning. I\u2019m not trying to get anything from Kaelus.I\u2019m not by his side because I want to be loved by my favorite. I\u2019m trying to make him live.What glory would I gain from living with my share? This isn\u2019t even my house anyway.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dLet\u2019s be calm, let\u2019s be calm.I gulped down the cold coffee.~~~~A long time later, Kaelus finally woke up from his nap. It\u2019s a nap, but when he woke up, it was almost dinner time.Clarice, the maid, came and informed me.\u201cMadam, the master wants to eat with you.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dThe time has come.I tried not to think on purpose about what he was going to say. Whatever comes up, don\u2019t panic and stay calm with a calm manner.I entered the dining hall with a trembling heart.\u201cDid you have a good rest?\u201d\u201cOh, my head is quite clear.\u201dKaelus, who was here first, replies casually. Am I the only one who\u2019s nervous?I started eating.\u201cBut what you have to say is\u2026?\u201dEventually, I couldn\u2019t help but bring it up first. I should solve this first, even if I\u2019m so nervous.Kaelus smiled faintly.\u201cYou must have been very curious.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThat\u2019s not true!His smile grew a little, as if to reassure me that my silence was interpreted as positive.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal. Don\u2019t worry too much.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dWhat\u2019s with that smile?Perhaps he was sorry for me, who was so nervous, Kaelus eventually opened his heavy lips slowly.\u201cI felt something after meeting Heli today.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt was all thanks to you that I was able to recover to this extent.\u201dHis face flushed with sudden gratitude.\u201c\u2026what? I\u2026\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong, Kaelus? I\u2019m tearing up for no reason.His voice echoed calmly.\u201cIt\u2019s an undeniable fact. At least if you grab everyone in this house and ask them, they\u2019ll all say the same thing.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t say anything because I was choked up. Oh, really, what\u2019s wrong, Kaelus.\u201cIt\u2019s silly, but I still don\u2019t know what you really want. There are so many things that just can\u2019t be explained by just wanting to be my spouse.\u201d\u201cHaha, how wonderful it is that you got married. Especially to someone who doesn\u2019t have anything like me.\u201dI tried to hold back my tears and laughed,\u201cBut for that matter, you didn\u2019t satisfy your self-interest much. In fact, what you did as a marchioness was all for me as a result.\u201dMy heart keeps pounding at the plain way of speaking.What\u2019s wrong with him? Are you trying to say, \u2018Let\u2019s stop and get divorced now that we\u2019ve recovered?\u2019I haven\u2019t even completed my revenge yet.\u201cKaelus, why are you saying this all of a sudden\u2026?\u201dI managed to keep my smile alive.Then, the purple eyes suddenly became blurred.\u201cBecause I\u2019m worried about you.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?\u201dI quickly asked back to an answer that I didn\u2019t understand.His expression slightly darkened.\u201cI was like you.\u201d\u201c\u2026? \u2026!\u201dAt first, I was surprised, but I realized it at the moment.What he said in common was his past dedication to Diana and my present dedication to him.\u201cKael, that\u2019s\u2026.\u201dI reflexively tried to answer that we were completely different. But Kaelus shook his head heavily.\u201cDo you want to say it\u2019s different? But no. You and I are the same.\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe voice was so determined that I couldn\u2019t argue with it again, so I shut up.A quiet table.\u201c\u2026I don\u2019t want you to do that.\u201dWhat do you mean? I asked inside.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t try hard for me without asking. Even if it seems nothing right now, in the end, it will remain as a disease of the heart.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs far as I\u2019m concerned, listening to him now,I just want to cry my head off.\u201cI thought I was happy just to give it to her. The choice is what up to her anyway, so I was grateful enough just to have helped her.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t. People, people, they unconsciously want it. I hope it will come back as much as you gave.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI listened to him in silence. I couldn\u2019t bring myself to speak because I felt like crying at that moment when I opened my mouth.\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t mind now. You want to deny it.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you have to admit it. Someday, you can be disappointed and collapse because you can\u2019t receive the reward you gave me.\u201dHe doesn\u2019t know.What he\u2019s giving me back now.I slipped away tears with my fingertips.\u201cKaelus, that\u2019s all I have to say.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been paid back just by you staying alive and not dying anymore.\u201d\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cWhat you want from Diana and what I want from you are completely different. Don\u2019t worry about it. I\u2019m not going to collapse.\u201dTears clouded my eyes and I couldn\u2019t eat.I left the dining hall.~~~~I came back to the room as if I were running away.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dTo prevent sobbing, Ibit my lips tightly and held back the sound from leaking out.A suppressed cry.I\u2019m upset. I\u2019m upset. It\u2019s cold.Why did you pretend to understand me? You know how I feel.I\u2019m definitely not trying to treat Kaelus like he did with Diana in the past.I really, truly hope that Kaelus is so happy that there is nothing more to explain.I do not presuppose myself in his happiness.To put it more extreme, even if Kaelus divorces me and remarries Diana, I\u2019m willing to support him as long as he\u2019s happy.Even if he curses me for being a pushover, if it means that he wants to live with the woman he loves anyway, I can send my blessing to do so.\u201cKaelus, you fool\u2026.\u201dSo the bottom line of what he says is, after all, that I should not live for him anymore.He\u2019s worried about me, he\u2019s worried about losing all my motivation by being disappointed like myself.That\u2019s why you want me to live with my share, that\u2019s what you want to say.It\u2019s nothing else that makes me cry.It\u2019s because you worry about me unnecessarily. It\u2019s too much to take care of yourself, so why are you worried about me?I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ll be like a year from now, but there\u2019s revenge that I can\u2019t do unless it\u2019s now, so why are you holding me back?I didn\u2019t care at all if Kaelus didn\u2019t know my affection. But I didn\u2019t expect this kind of response.\u201cOh my..\u201dDon\u2019t be sorry for me, don\u2019t be thankful. There\u2019s nothing to be afraid of being like you, Kaelus.Because I\u2019m not like you. I have no lingering feelings in this world. Except for you, Kael.To tell me to end this fanaticism is no advice to me, who lives in the joy of fanning my favorite.That means to deny my present.~~~~At a time when I was sobbing silently for a long time.\u201cMadam!\u201d\u201c?\u201dThe voice of the butler Uross came urgently. I quickly wiped away my tears and quickly opened the door.\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cMadam, the doctor has taken him to his room!\u201d\u201cWhat? The doctor?\u201dI felt like my whole body was cooling off in an instant.He\u2019s been holding out without medication for the last few days.Without time to think deeply, I moved my feet first. I came out of the door and ran. The destination is Kaelus\u2019 room at the end of the hallway.\u201cKael?\u201dI pushed through the unclosed door.Two startled pairs of eyes turned to me at the same time.\u201cHess\u2026\u201d\u201cMadam?\u201dI just hardened myself.The reality was very different from what I imagined in my head. I remembered that Kaelus had a violent seizure after meeting Helios who came to his house in the past.The sight before me was calm and calm. The doctor opened his mouth with hesitation.\u201cHe had a mild seizure on his way out of the dining hall\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just that I couldn\u2019t breathe for a moment, Hess.\u201dKaelus replaced the doctor\u2019s last words.I was dazed as if I had been hit by a giant hammer on my head.\u201cIt\u2019s because of me\u2026?\u201d\u201cHess. Wait a minute.\u201dKaelus shook his hand and pulled his doctor back. Soon all the maids in the room, including him, went outside.It\u2019s just him and me.I was half panicked and stared at the man in front of me.Did you really have a relapse because of me? Then with me, he can\u2019t recover\u2026\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dSitting on the bed, he called me. Still, I couldn\u2019t keep my mouth shut.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Come here.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, come check it out. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201dHis persistent call forced my feet forward. I hesitated to approach his bed.\u201c\u2026\u201dPale complexion. You said it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but did it hurt a lot?My face is distorted again. Tears filling one\u2019s eyes. What should I do because I\u2019m sorry?\u201cHess, why\u2026.\u201d\u201cSorry, I do\u2026!\u201dI was crying but I kept my voice going. Tears trickled down like a child.\u201cI, like that, get angry\u2026 I left\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. Hess.\u201dWhile I couldn\u2019t see properly because of my tears, someone\u2019s warm hand gently pulled my hand.Despite the extremely weak force, I was drawn by it as if I were stuck and flopped at the end of the bed.\u201cI\u2019m sorry I made you cry.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2026.\u201d\u201cHess, listen to me first.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s a soft tone, but it had the power giving no room to resist.While it was quiet everywhere, only Kaelus\u2019 voice rang softly.\u201cIt\u2019s actually for myself that I brought that up to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cPretending to be worried about you, I was actually afraid. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll hear a reproach from you in the future.\u201dPerhaps he bowed his head, his long silver hair slid forward.\u201cHestia, I\u2026.\u201dA brief hesitation but soon the voice continued.\u201cMaybe I won\u2019t be able to do \u2018love\u2019 again.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI have a throbbing pain in my chest. Because I know why Kaelus is so disappointed.It is because Kaelus uffered so badly from his first love. This is because he loved with all its heart and passion failed miserably.After a big failure in love, everyone will be the same. In the future, you will never want to love, and you will never believe the feeling of love itself.How I wish I could say flatly otherwise. Life is long and long, so what is there to worry about if you can guarantee that another love comes after a failed love.But life is not something that no one can guarantee.Therefore, neither can I hastily answer to Kaelus that it is not.\u201cAs hard as you try for me, I thought I couldn\u2019t give it back. And my experience overlapped in my head. I was afraid you\u2019d be discouraged by me.\u201dKaelus spat out like a sigh.\u201cPeople\u2019s hearts are so insensitive. I\u2019m afraid you\u2019ve done your best to me, and I\u2019m going to leave you exhausted.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI just wanted you to do it moderately, enough not to resent me.\u201dA feeble confession.Again, I don\u2019t want to go through the same black loneliness as before.I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll love me, but I don\u2019t want to lose my love for him.You have no shame in thinking for yourself.So he told me not to work too hard.\u201c\u2026Kaelus.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe did not answer. Is he blaming himself?I have to give him certainty. The fear that is gripping Kaelus must be dispelled.\u201cKael, I promise. That\u2019s why I won\u2019t collapse, I swear to you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know what kind of person I am. I just have to do everything I want to do.\u201dI may sound a little sorry, but let\u2019s talk about it.\u201cKaelus, it\u2019s the most important thing for me to achieve my goal, I don\u2019t care much whether someone loves me or not. I\u2019m telling you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cSo don\u2019t try to force yourself to love. That\u2019s cheating on the other person.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026\u201dKaelus looked at me with purple eyes as if he had something to say.But it was obvious what he was going to say, so I shook my head.\u201cYou want to tell Diana that you felt this way at first, right? But let me be clear. There\u2019s something else I want.\u201dSounds very cold to strangers. You\u2019re saying to the other person, \u2018I don\u2019t want you\u2019.But that\u2019s what Kaelus needs most today.\u201cKaelus, you can give me as much as you want. And I\u2019m not going to leave.\u201dI smiled with a tearful face. It looks a little silly, but I don\u2019t know why I want to reassure him.\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus, smiling and crying, with a mysterious look on his face.It seems like he is appealing to me with his eyes and his whole body that he doesn\u2019t want to go through such terrible loneliness that he wants to die again.How can I not do that? I will stand by Kaelus no matter what while I am in this world.I smiled softly.\u201cIt\u2019s late at night. You\u2019ll be on your medication, so go to sleep.\u201dHow scared must he been to have had a seizure as soon as he left the dining hall.So I also pledge to myself. I will never scare him.\u201c\u2026Hestia. Well, I have a favor to ask of you.\u201dHis slightly blurred purple eyes turned towards me.I looked at him without a word and answered in silence. Tell me anything. I\u2019ll listen to everything.\u201cStay here with me, until I\u2019m completely asleep. Don\u2019t leave.\u201d\u201c!\u201dAn unexpected remark.I was surprised for a moment, but I nodded at once.\u201cAlright.\u201dI sat on the edge of the bed, looking for his hand and clasping it to confirm my words.\u201c\u2026good night.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dThe brilliant purple faded slowly into the eyelids.With our hands clasped together\u201c\u2026.\u201dI sat motionless for a long time.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a while, regular breathing sounds rang out in the quiet space.I smiled a little and let go.I hope you only have happy dreams.My favorite.~~~~A few days after that. A heavy rain day.Nevertheless, I hurried to get ready to go out despite the inconvenience. I had a lot of work to do, so I couldn\u2019t afford to spend time at home just because it was raining.Kaelus leaned against the doorway, his arms folded in his gown.\u201cDo you really have to go out in this weather?\u201d\u201cWell, but I don\u2019t have time to be lazy.\u201dI tried not to look at Kaelus. His bare chest was exposed so bare through those baggy robes.After holding his hand until he fell asleep at night, his attitude suddenly became intimate over the past few days.I felt sorry for him. Rather than feeling burdened, I don\u2019t think I can breathe with the excitement. Maybe I should take some of the medicine that Kaelus is taking.Kaelus clicked his tongue disapprovingly.\u201cTsk, but it\u2019s raining too much.\u201d\u201cEverything runs on the pavement to the palace. The carriage will be alright.\u201d\u201cWho was worried about the carriage?\u201dI chuckled at the complaints.\u201cI know, Kaelus, I\u2019ll be careful. It won\u2019t take long, because I\u2019m coming straight back from the crown prince.\u201dAs if watching his mother go out without him, Kaelus is quite persistent today.Clarice, who was with me, added.\u201cIf Hestia is behind schedule, I\u2019ll send someone to pick her up. The carriage won\u2019t leave the boulevard anyway.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAs if he had nothing to say, Kaelus finally closed his mouth.I can\u2019t help but laugh. It seems like I\u2019m dreaming that my favorite is calling me this much.With a well-sealed envelope of the prophecy, I climbed into a carriage bound for the palace.~~~~In the days before I went to see Helios, I was very busy processing letters constantly.The first letter received was none other than a reply from Baron Potos.<I can\u2019t help but feel sorry for the marchioness\u2019 anger.>The baron\u2019s grovel was palpable in every letter.Anyway, the conclusion was easy. To correct the hype about my investment plan.But it\u2019s hard to tell from his words whether he\u2019s really fulfilling his word. So I had to write a letter to Harmonia, too.<If there\u2019s any speculation about my investment, please tell them I haven\u2019t decided yet.>Harmonia replied that she would soon do so.Next, I received a reply to a letter from Countess Erinnis. The same letter that Diocke was aiming for the second wife of the two greats, crown prince and marquis.And she paid the right price for the interesting information I leaked.<Diocke is a very vain young lady.>It was a very satisfactory price.Erinnis will take care of the rest of the work. I just have to wait for the scandal about Diocke to spread in society.When Diocke, in a hurry comes running, she slowly coaxes her by shaking a carrot that looks good in front of her*.*TN: baiting her like a predator with the illusion that she\u2019s going to help with the rumorsThere is no one better to use than a vain, stupid human being.~~~~\u201cThe Empire\u2019s great little\u2026.\u201d\u201cAlright, get up.\u201dAs soon as I saw Helios, I took a courtesy, and immediately I got a gesture to omit it, as if he were annoyed.Are you back to your usual character now? No wonder it\u2019s nice to see you.I stretched out with a light sigh, hmm. Thanks to the beautiful black-haired handsome man, the surroundings are very bright despite the gloomy weather.Helios looked out of the window and asked grimly.\u201cIf you\u2019re coming through the heavy rain, you must have tremendous business.\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you tell me before that it is not for me to judge the importance of prophecy?\u201d\u201c\u2026I did.\u201dHelios gave a grim affirmation.I smiled brightly and held out the envelope I had brought.\u201cRemembering that, I brought the prophecy like this. Your highness, please look carefully at the seriousness of the matter.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe golden eyes that look at me sharply. He does know, right? I\u2019m feeding him now.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dWhile Helios was reading the prophecy, only the sound of rain pounding on the windows rang in the room.\u201cThe Baron Potos\u2019 merchant ship will sink soon.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness,\u201dHe paced around the window with a letter.\u201cThere must be a lot of aristocrats who invest in the baron.\u201d\u201cYes. I met him a few days ago and he said he was planning to attract more investors.\u201dHelios stopped pacing. The keen golden eyes shone as if they could pierce me.\u201cThere will be a lot of damage.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cBut why not stop the investment?\u201dA suspicious look on my face but the answer is already in place.\u201cIn fact, I also thought at first that I would warn those who invested in Potos\u2019 merchant ships of danger. But Kaelus stopped me.\u201d\u201cKael stopped you\u2026?\u201dEyes that were bounded in an instant.I somehow became bitter. Because Helios still trusts his friend who broke up with him.\u201cKael says, of course, you have to take risks with your investment. He\u2019s right. Merchant ships always have the potential to sink. There\u2019s no need to protect investments prepared for that.\u201d\u201cBut if the investment is large, it\u2019s like losing the wealth of the entire empire.\u201d\u201cThen we have to think on what pretext to stop aristocrats from investing. If you say so, who will listen to it right away?\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dHelios frowned. He seems to be troubled by the difficult situation.I said coldly.\u201cIt\u2019s impossible to stop all the damage. We can only try to minimize it.\u201dHelios, who nodded slightly, seems to have understood what I said to some extent.To suggest a realistic plan, we have no choice but to meet investors and persuade them one by one while hiding the prophecy\u2019s existence. The imperial family cannot officially ruin the baron\u2019s business.\u201cI\u2019ll try under the table for now. I\u2019m going to encourage people I know not to invest in the merchant ships as much as possible.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s the only way to do it right now.\u201dThis concludes the important business.I asked one thing that I was curious about all along.\u201cWell, your highness the crown prince. This is a little bit of a different matter, but\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201dA beautiful face looked at me in wonder.I coughed with a gesture.\u201cWell, I realized that when I visited the emperor before, you also hid the existence of the prophecies.\u201d\u201cOh, you mean that.\u201dHelios sighed bitterly.\u201cIt\u2019s not for a grand reason. However, it was difficult to convey hastily because one of your predictions was about the safety of the rich.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s quite cruel to know in advance what your destiny will be like. I don\u2019t want the emperor to lose hope.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI sympathized with Helios\u2019 true intentions.Kaelus was born with the fate of a supporting role that was forced to be completely pushed back.The original novel is only aimed at the happy ending of Diana and Helios, and is not very interested in the ending of the supporting role that made their love stand out. It might not be possible to tell more about the supporting character\u2019s story, but the other story usually depicts the backstory of the main character\u2019s story. Moreover, the novel does not even have an extra book.After I was possessed as an extra in the novel, I sat on the sidelines of this world and never decided to let Kaelus know, \u2018You\u2019re destined to be abandoned anyway.\u2019The reason was simple. Because, as Helios said, I did not want his glorious life to collapse all at once by telling him in advance of his irreplaceable fate.But if Kaelus knew that he would not overcome despair and choose to die.What choice would I make then?Suddenly, a grave voice was heard.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dI quickly slipped out of my thoughts and came to my senses.Helios asked in a rather feeble tone.\u201cHave you ever suffered because of the prophecy?\u201dI had a silly laugh. Why does he care about my feelings?\u201cFortunately, I don\u2019t know everything, so I\u2019m not much different from ordinary people.\u201dThe prophecies are a bitch. I\u2019m just deceiving everyone with the future I remember before the return as if I were a prophet.Helios breathed a long, stuffy sigh.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI looked at him in silence.Helios must be having a hard time these days. His beloved wife is getting twisted, and his father is always in bed, and his only friend has declared their friendship off, and nothing is going to work out properly.But there is still a long way to go. Helios needs to suffer a lot more than this so I can feel better.You have to pay the price for bringing Kaelus to his death. It\u2019s not something you can only pay back with this frustration.Helios\u2019s gaze turned to me again. I quickly fixed my face on his face.\u201cBut I\u2019d like to ask you something else.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cWhat happened at Diana\u2019s tea party before\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dI let out a sigh without realizing it.At that time, I flipped out in front of Diana, and then left, I briefly encountered Helios.How can you not forget that time and bring it up like this? It\u2019s a punishment.I bowed my head first.\u201cOn that day, I apologize for my insolence to the crown princess.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t mean to blame you.\u201dWow. What\u2019s going on?I was starting to get nervous. Something always happens when that guy does something he doesn\u2019t do.Surprisingly, there was no hostility in Helios\u2019 face.\u201cDidn\u2019t you get hurt that day?\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, yes.\u201dI remember being hit by the tea. As expected, Helios had a very good memory.I smiled bitterly.\u201cDid the crown princess demand an apology? Well, I\u2019m thinking of visiting her when her anger is relieved.\u201d\u201cActually, it\u2019s a very shameful thing to tell you.\u201dHelios also stretched his lips bitterly.\u201cI haven\u2019t been able to talk to Diana very well lately.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s hard to keep a straight face. I\u2019m in trouble because my cheekbones keep going up.Helios, who doesn\u2019t know my troubles, continued to talk.\u201cI was going to talk to Diana about the tea party, but she avoided the conversation. I had no choice but to hear the details from the servants.\u201d\u201cOh, my. What a pity.\u201d\u201cBut your remarks went quite far, too. It was like insulting Diana and me all at once.\u201dIt\u2019s not that he\u2019s angry, it\u2019s more of an objective way of speaking.So I responded plainly.\u201cYes, I know. So I\u2019m willing to apologize. Although, Your Highness Dianna will not apologize for insulting my husband and I.\u201d\u201cWhoa, that\u2019s\u2026 Yeah, you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll apologize for her.\u201d said Helios, shaking his head.But I shook my head at once.\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone apologizing for her. Now that I\u2019ve said it, I\u2019ll be honest with you.\u201dI strained my eyes and looked into Helios\u2019 eyes.\u201cHow long will your highness be cleaning up after Your Highness Diana? Even as a saintess, wasn\u2019t she always satisfied with the cleaning up of your highness and Kaelus?\u201d\u201cHey, Hestia.\u201dAs if it had hit the nail on the head, the gold eyes were sharply distorted.The response is pleasant, but I don\u2019t really want to fight now.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Your Grace. I ended up spitting out unfiltered words.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, you don\u2019t know fear.\u201dHowever, his voice is not as angry as expected. an angry but helpless air of acceptance.\u201c\u2026yes. All you want is an apology from Diana.\u201dOh, that\u2019s a pretty sharp insight.Actually, that\u2019s what I\u2019m ultimately hoping for. More precisely, Diana apologizes to Kaelus.I purposely hardened my voice.\u201cYour highness the crown prince, it may sound a bit harsh, but Her Highness Diana may have a cause, but she won\u2019t be popular.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf the saintess does not change her attitude, it is all up to the crown prince. You have to convince the holy princess as soon as possible.\u201dOf course, I\u2019m saying this knowing it\u2019s impossible. The more he hears these words, the more likely Helios will be to burst into laughter.He laughed bitterly again.\u201cYou never speak in a roundabout way. You\u2019re so straightforward that you\u2019re annoying.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. I\u2019ll take it as a compliment.\u201dAt the end of his gaze toward me.\u201c\u2026I envy you, Kael. Sincerely.\u201dAn outburst of inner thoughts.I answered back in a jest.\u201cOh, is your highness, famous for his fiery love, jealous of a couple who are made of paper?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios\u2019 mouth was stretched again.I thought he would say something back, but it\u2019s still quiet. That\u2019s a relief.Anyway, I\u2019m done with my business, so I should get going. Any later, Kaelus will be worried.\u201cThen I\u2019ll leave now.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dThe golden eyes suddenly sank into a murky state.I don\u2019t know why, but I decided to get off my nerves easily.I backed out of his presence.~~~~The carriage drove through the heavy rain again.As soon as I landed safely on the porch of the mansion, I asked Clarice, who had come to meet me.\u201cIs everything all right with Kaelus?\u201d\u201cYes, but he\u2019s been checking out the window, so you\u2019d better hurry up and go.\u201d\u201cHa ha\u2026 Okay.\u201dLeaving behind the smiling Clarice, I went straight to Kaelus\u2019 room without having time to change my outdoor clothes.There was always one person left all the time in the space where Kaelus was still. It was because he was still anxious to be alone.I made a sign at the door. Soon the servant inside came out, checked me, and let me in right away.\u201cKaelus.\u201dA picturesque sight.A slender shadow with long hair was standing by the window where the rain splashed.I feel emotional for some reason. I guess I got sentimental because I could hear the sound of rain in the dark room.The unrealistically beautiful portrait moved gently.\u201cDid you just come back?\u201dI grinned at the dry yet soft voice of Kaelus.\u201cYes, it\u2019s not too late, is it?\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dKaelus approached, dragging his slippers. I also sat down on a nearby sofa.As usual, he stuck out a warm tea in front of me. I was very glad to be warm when I ran in the cold rain.\u201cI told the crown prince one more piece of prophecy. It\u2019s about Baron Potos\u2019 merchant ship.\u201d\u201cWow. Did you tell him in the end? It\u2019s much earlier than I thought.\u201dAn unexpected tone. I\u2019m embarrassed for some reason.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t mean to keep my mouth shut forever\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cI thought you\u2019d let him know after the ship set sail.\u201dHe chuckled. I smiled, too.\u201cThen there\u2019s no point in predicting.\u201dThe conversation was interrupted for a moment because I was drinking tea. Still, I feel comfortable that it is not awkward.I opened my mouth as if it were a passing remark.\u201cThe crown prince says he envies you.\u201d\u201cHeli\u2026\u201dKaelus also asked dry as if it were no big deal.\u201cYes, I can\u2019t talk to the crown prince these days.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cActually, it was a little unexpected. Conflict within the imperial family is a very sensitive issue. He must be very wary of me, but he can\u2019t say that.\u201dThen Kaelus snorted softly.\u201cHelios must be determined to trust you. Anyway, we\u2019ve decided to be friendly.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThat was a pretty sincere feeling. He\u2019d rather confess than calculate rationally.However, there is no need to report his psychological state in front of Kaelus. He could no longer handle the emotional trash, so he declared his friendship with him over.Therefore, it is sufficient to convey the proper dynamics of Helios.I asked jokingly.\u201cIt\u2019s gloomy because it\u2019s raining today. Do you want me to hold your hand when you\u2019re sleeping?\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dKaelus smiled absurdly.\u201cYou\u2019re having fun treating me like a kid, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201d\u201cHa ha, it was a joke.\u201dI evaded it with a moderate laugh. I\u2019m thankful that we can exchange jokes like this without any burden.The purple gaze slipped away from me.\u201cIf it doesn\u2019t clear up after dinner, do it.\u201d\u201cOh, shall we?\u201dI asked back on purpose, glumly. On the other hand, Kael only nodded silently.All right. I\u2019ll have to hold a rain ritual to pour out the storm.~~~~Sadly, the rain that had been falling all day stopped just in time for the evening.\u201cYes.\u201dKaelus returned to his room with a somewhat teasing look.I pulled only my innocent handkerchief out of desperation. Should I have held the rain ritual more sincerely?But it wasn\u2019t good enough to stick to the iron plate on my face, so I had to come back to my room alone.\u201c\u2026\u201dI saw a pile of work on the desk.Yes, this is the god of the world telling me to stop being a fan and do my job well.I changed my mind and sat down at the desk. Then J began to review various reports from the Illion estate one by one.Public health was the most important thing I put my heart and soul into dealing with the territorial affairs instead of Kaelus. It was because the habit of living in a neat modern Korea remained even after I was possessed.By supplying soap, personal hygiene has been solved to some extent. However, in most cases, the decision of permanent residence is necessary for public health.So after the embankment repair was completed, I steadily ordered sewage maintenance through the management of the estate.\u201cAt least Illion needs to make the street smell gone.\u201dI read the document carefully, chewing the tip of the pen.The issue of sanitation in the estate was also very closely related to my ground objectives. The cleaner commoners\u2019 daily life are, the less they will be sick. Then soon, the visits to the temple will be less frequent.And this was already showing up as figures. When Illion people\u2019s use of soap became a habit, it was showing its effectiveness, though not rapidly.\u201cOkay, budget approval\u2026!\u201dAfter reviewing all the carefully arranged items, I melted the wax and pressed the marquis\u2019s seal ring onto it.\u201cWhoa\u2026 Let\u2019s get some fresh air\u2026.\u201dI opened the terrace door wide to cool my hot head. A cool night breeze blew in. The clean air after the rain stopped was pleasant.I glimpsed the other side of the building.\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dLaughing softly enough to be heard only by me.There was also Kaelus on the other side of the terrace. It was a dark night when the rain had just stopped, so I couldn\u2019t see his face well, but it was clear that he was facing me.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMe too, we just looked at each other like that.We\u2019re going to play the timing game. I might be standing like this all night before someone goes in first.\u201cHehe. I can\u2019t do it.\u201dYou can\u2019t keep your best friend on the terrace, who\u2019s not feeling well.I waved to him gently.Good night. Sweet dreams.Greeting inwardly, I left his sight.~~~~The bad days went on for days. It\u2019s about time; I missed the sunny weather.At last she came to the marquis.\u201cMadam, Baron Potos\u2019 young lady is asking to see you.\u201d\u201cOh, is Diocke here?\u201dThe butler\u2019s words made me giggle. I\u2019ve been waiting so long to see why she was not coming.I relaxed down to the drawing room. Thinking about Diocke who must be nervous, I think I\u2019m going to hum.As soon as I entered the room with my neck straightened, the guest jumped to her feet.\u201cLady Hestia, marchioness\u2026!\u201dDiocke stooped to me with an air of helplessness \u2013 maybe a high-level performance.I deliberately pretended not to know and answered in a bright voice.\u201cOh, my God, Diocke. You\u2019re here in spite of all this wretched weather. You must have something important to say?\u201dIsn\u2019t it scarier to ask with a smile? Diocke replied with an even more restless look.\u201cI seem to have caused the marchioness a great misunderstanding, so\u2026 I\u2019m here because I wanted you to relieve your anger.\u201d\u201cHmm? What do you mean misunderstanding? What do you mean I\u2019m wrong?\u201d\u201cLady Marquis\u2026!\u201dDiocke\u2019s face grew redder and redder.It\u2019s only fun when you play a joke moderately. I had a flash of laughter.\u201cDiocke.\u201d\u201cYes, marchioness\u2026.\u201dShe also noticed the change in the atmosphere and shrugged.\u201cAs you know, I was a commoner and became an adopted daughter of an aristocrat. And I came up to the position of the marquis\u2019 wife.\u201dI leaned forward in Diocke.\u201cA woman who was under your feet came up here, and you didn\u2019t feel anything? That\u2019s disappointing.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dShe was sweating profusely.I fiddled with my finger, gazing ecstatically at the seal ring.\u201cYou took me for granted, Diocke.\u201d\u201cNo, marchioness! I\u2019m\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up. Don\u2019t open your mouth any time.\u201dElegantly smiling and yelling is the best effect on making the other person emotionally uncomfortable.If you had a scintillator to stand up to me, you\u2019d cut me in here once, right?And fortunately, Diocke had such a strong heart.\u201cSorry, marchioness! But please listen to my excuse first\u2026!\u201dWow, it\u2019s pretty good. If I\u2019m is prepared to use abusive language like that, I won\u2019t be scared even in front of Princess Diana.I raised my chin and listened to her in silence.\u201cMy behavior must have been deeply disconcerting to the marchioness. Please forgive me. I\u2019ll be careful from now on.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut I swear I didn\u2019t mean to flirt with the marquis. If you were displeased with my conduct at the dinner, I will beg for your pardon.\u201dHer oath is very light. I snorted.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dNevertheless, Diocke did not stop.\u201cAnd to the crown prince\u2026 Oh, marchioness! Seriously, I didn\u2019t have such an indecent mind. I was very embarrassed by the rumor that I had committed an offence to the marchioness\u2026\u201dOh, my.She seems to think that rumors were misinformed when she hinted to Erinnis that she was deliberately \u201ctrying to get the crown prince\u2019s wife.\u201dHowever, Diocke\u2019s ambition may already be growing inside, but it has not been revealed yet.The baron family, including her, are destined to run away at night soon, so we will let them enjoy it moderately.\u201cAll right, Diocke.\u201dI straightened my shoulders to the fullest.\u201cBut I don\u2019t usually believe in verbal apologies.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026?\u201dDiocke rolled his eyes nervously and looked at me.I smiled a smile.\u201cHow is your father\u2019s business going these days?\u201dWithout questioning the sudden questioning of the business, Diocke\u2019s face turned almost still.\u201cAh\u2026 but the marchioness is very angry with my father\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou know very well. It\u2019s not something that can be solved by yourself today.\u201d\u201cThen my mom and I will come back and see the marchioness!\u201d\u201cNo, you don\u2019t have to. I just told you. I don\u2019t like verbal apologies.\u201dI beckoned her close.\u201cSo tell me first. How\u2019s the money coming in?\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 It\u2019s\u2026\u201dDiocke hesitated whether to really answer or not.It seems that the work will continue smoothly only when the atmosphere is warmed up a little.\u201cThen shall I tell you what I think first? I don\u2019t think you\u2019re getting the funds as fast as you expected yet. I immediately denied what Baron Potos had said.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I felt a little sorry. Your family\u2019s business has been disrupted, and your reputation has spread.\u201d\u201cLady Marquis\u2026\u201dDiocke looked at me with tears in her eyes. If this is acting, there will be no problem passing the audition.But there\u2019s no reason for me to concede that she\u2019s crying.\u201cThere\u2019s a way to prove that your father and daughter are truly apologizing and to solve the lack of funds at the same time, do you want to hear that?\u201d\u201cAt once\u2026solve\u2026?\u201dDiocke\u2019s eyes were suspicious for a moment, but soon they were clear.\u201cHow can we not listen to the wise marquis\u2019 wife? Please give me your opinion.\u201dShe quickly changed her attitude to flattery mode. I guess you learned this as a world-wise art. It\u2019s too bad.That\u2019s true, it\u2019s a mistake that anyone who has just become an adult and steps into society makes at least once. To think that you\u2019ve overcome the crisis by saying \u201cyes, yes\u201d only on the surface.Even though she is thin enough to notice at once unless she is seriously dark around him, she is mistaken that she has lived a great social life.I spoke in a casual tone.\u201cMake the crown princess invest in the merchant ship of your family.\u201d\u201c!\u201dDiocke failed to manage his facial expression nicely.There\u2019s no socialite who doesn\u2019t know what I\u2019m on with Diana. The recent bitter quarrel between the two at Diana\u2019s private meeting has already spread widely.And the most important thing. Diana doesn\u2019t spend money like hell.\u201cIf you persuade the crown princess, I will also accept the baron and your sincerity.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dDiocke could not easily give a positive answer, with his mouth open.They seem to be realizing how difficult this mission is. However, it is a position that cannot but be accepted.If she turned down my request. Confidence in the merchant ship business will continue to fall, and Diocke\u2019s reputation will get worse and worse.I added in a grumpy voice.\u201cBy the way, I want you to keep it secret that I asked for it. If you talk about it, it\u2019ll only get in the way of persuading the crown princess, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dDiocke clenched his lips.She\u2019s probably tapping the calculator hard in her head right now. What are the chances of making Diana invest.At the same time, she\u2019ll be trying to figure out why I want Diana\u2019s investment.\u201cWell, Lady Marquis. With all due respect, may I ask why you want it?\u201dAs expected, the question came up.I smirked.\u201cI told you earlier. I\u2019m feeling a little sorry for your father. If the merchant ship\u2019s funding is insufficient because of my willingness to invest, I think I can offset it to some extent with the investment of the crown princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dDioke, who has closed her mouth again, seems to have a complicated mind.The justification is perfect, but it seems to feel strangely reluctant. I\u2019m sure you can\u2019t find anything to refute.It\u2019s all on your own. Who told you to mess with me?\u201cWell, it\u2019s a difficult task, so you don\u2019t have to take it. If I refuse to apologize to you and your father, that\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cNo, Lady Marquis. I\u2019ll do as you say.\u201dDiocke raised his head with a stiff look. There is a determined determination that there is nothing she can\u2019t do. Oh, my.I purposely laughed brightly.\u201cHahaha, you are strong-minded. My eyes are not wrong.\u201d\u201cLady Marquis\u2026\u201dAfter raising Dioke to my heart\u2019s content, I kept my smile on my face and lowered it seriously.\u201cI\u2019ll see what you and the baron can do. I\u2019ll bury my unpleasant experiences and prove to you that I\u2019m good enough to ride with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Of course. I\u2019m just grateful for the opportunity.\u201dDiocke said in a cracked voice.Still, Baroness Potos and her daughter will face Diana more easily. Because I\u2019ve laid out the board well in advance by delivering the prophecy through Helios.Which way will Diana lean, between my prediction of the 'sinking of a merchant ship\u201d through Helios and the persuasion of Baron Potos and his passionate daughter?Frankly, the answer is obvious.I slowly rose from my seat.\u201cNext time I see you again, please bring the news I\u2019m looking forward to.\u201dIt was a sign of the end of the conversation. Diocke also followed me up, and then politely saluted.\u201cI won\u2019t let you down on what you\u2019re looking forward to. Please trust me and my father\u2019s sincerity.\u201dI nodded quietly at her.Then she showed her back to me and walked out of the drawing-room.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 27": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe bad weather that had continued had cleared up for the first time in a long time.\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dI opened the window and took a deep breath of fresh air. It feels like my head was clearing up at the same time. I\u2019m happy.Then, with a small knock, Clarice brought a letter.\u201cIt\u2019s from young lady Diocke.\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dOh, my God. What good news!I quickly opened the envelope and took out the paper.\u201cOh, my. .\u201dWow, that\u2019s pretty good, Diocke.Except for the repeated greetings, to get straight to the point, Diana promised to invest. Even at the risk of her crown princess status.Anyone who knows her character will be surprised by the news. Even the greedy Baron Potos must be spreading this good news.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I don\u2019t invest at all. Hehehe\u2026.\u201dThe revival of Baron Potos\u2019 merchant ship business, in fact, is by no means a good thing for the entire empire. Because the business was about to sink into the water.But I don\u2019t care. There is no reason to take the risk of investment.It\u2019s just that for me, the well-being of this empire is not important.It doesn\u2019t matter if the wealth of the empire sinks into the water. I don\u2019t care what the ants are doing with the stupid Diana.\u201cBy the way, I\u2019m curious about your secret.\u201dWhat did Diocke say to her that Diana fell for it?Actually, there is something to point out. What do you usually do in order to quickly become best friends after an awkward relationship?You just have to chew the same object hard together!**TN: hate the same thingsI don\u2019t know exactly what Diocke would have said about me when she was sitting with Diana, but it\u2019s obvious because she attracted investment from Diana, who was famous for not opening her wallet.But I\u2019m not really angry. Rather, I want to pour a bucket of compliments to Diocke for her hard work.\u201cBut Helios won\u2019t just wait and see\u2026.\u201dUnlike Diana, who is immersed only in her beliefs, Helios has quite a wide view. And he trusts my prophecies.I\u2019m dying to know. How is Helios coping with this situation?~~~~It was the first time in a long time that I sat face to face with Countess Erinnis.I tasted her fragrant tea. I was impressed by the smoothness of the taste.\u201cOh, what the hell is this?\u201d\u201cHuhu, it\u2019s a special grade imported fermented tea that\u2019s aged for 100 years.\u201dErinnis continued her explanation, making tea familiarly. Fermented tea tastes different depending on the time it is brewed, so you can enjoy it while drinking it several times.I chuckled.\u201cIt\u2019s not comparable to what I drank at the Lily Palace.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t have any friends.\u201dErinnis also responded cynically.\u201cBy the way, countess. Did you hear the news? Holy Lady Diana promised to invest a fortune in Baron Potos\u2019 business.\u201dI spoke as if it were someone else\u2019s business. It was only Baron Potos and I who knew that I had bought Diocke.Erinnis nodded.\u201cI heard it, too. But as long as it\u2019s a promise, it\u2019s actually no surprise. The bigger thing is next.\u201d\u201cHmm? What happened?\u201dAs expected, she has the ability to stand on her own feet. This information is her fastest and most accurate.\u201cIt is said that the crown prince ordered the saintess not to invest with the royal finances.\u201d\u201cOh, oh\u2026.\u201dHelios wasn\u2019t a regular bet, either. I can\u2019t believe you heard my foresight and used a \u2018command\u2019 to stop Diana from going crazy.As far as I know, in the original novel, the heroine Diana was rarely ordered. Think of it with common sense. Who dared to command a holy being who owns the power of God, whether it was a priest or a common person?Erinnis continued in a slightly excited tone.\u201cThe investment in merchant ships was out of the question unless there is a secret fund created by the saintess. I don\u2019t know if Baron Potos knows about this.\u201d\u201cWell, we\u2019ll find out soon. But they\u2019re probably trying to make some investment.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, marchioness. Because of her personality, she will try to keep her word no matter what.\u201dErinnis agreed with me.Then the question was.The royal treasury was also locked, so where will Diana, who doesn\u2019t have much money, get a large sum of money?There is only one answer.\u201c\u2026may attract funds from the temple\u2026.\u201d\u201c!\u201dMy murmur also seriously hardened Erinnis\u2019 expression.\u201cHa\u2026 I see. There was the temple\u2026!\u201dA fresh exclamation immediately followed.\u201cThe marchioness is really amazing. How can you think that far ahead?\u201d\u201cHaha, don\u2019t you think you can win a fight if you know your enemy well? I did a lot of research in my own way.\u201dI giggled back.In the meantime, she seemed to be focused on overthrowing Diana. To be honest, I didn\u2019t expect inspiration to come up so soon.Erinnis calmed her expression again.\u201cThe temple will not publicly fund the crown princess.\u201d\u201cI agree with the countess.\u201dSo I feel the need even more. The conclusion that the disclosure of the property of the temple or the disclosure of the accounting books should be made public.\u201cActually, that\u2019s why I\u2019m working at the salon\u2026\u2026.\u201dAs I slipped a piece of information, Erinnis quickly showed interest.\u201cWhat do you mean working?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to create a public opinion to release the list of assets that the temple has built up. Even accounting books.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201d\u201cBut we need a good justification. I\u2019m still in trouble because I don\u2019t have a decisive blow to question the temple.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dWe were lost in thought.Honestly, the dust that would come out was cold and overflowing. But it was my \u201cjustification\u201d that I ran into.The problem was that there were no bait to fish with underneath while the fish were playing a lot. Well, that could be a justification if Diana actually took the money from the temple.However, a more definite trigger is needed to send a hook in one shot in connection with Diana\u2019s financial case.It was quiet trying to figure out if there was a good way.Erinnis suddenly opened her mouth with a voice of no confidence.\u201cIt kept raining until not too long ago\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, but it wasn\u2019t as bad as last year.\u201d\u201cNo, not like that. When it rains a lot, there\u2019s usually an epidemic in the slums, right?\u201d\u201c!\u201dI looked at her with round eyes. She looked at me in surprise, too.\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good idea, countess?\u201d\u201cOh, I know! I was surprised when I told you.\u201dEven children know that infectious diseases are easy to spread in warm and humid environments. Perhaps the clinic in the temple is busy with patients by now.I developed my thoughts quickly.\u201cI can openly ask the temple why the epidemic didn\u2019t subside. And compare the situation with other territories where the epidemic has not spread relatively.\u201dI smiled softly as I spoke. Because there is already a territory to be compared.\u201cIllion\u2019s estate would be appropriate.\u201dErinnis also smiled with her eyes shining.\u201cAs expected, you\u2019re Hestia. Just let me know if you need anything. I\u2019ll help you as much as I can.\u201d\u201cThank you, oho. Erinnis.\u201dIt is a blessing to have a comrade who works in good harmony.We happily shared the rest of the tea.\u201cI\u2019ll make the tea a little longer this time.\u201d\u201cOkay. What else does it taste like?\u201d~~~~When I got home, I called the butler, Uross, right away.\u201cDo you have any instructions?\u201dI can trust and leave anything to him who is faithful to me as much as I am loyal to Kaelus.\u201cWe need to investigate how many infectious diseases are currently circulating among the people of imperial city. I need someone to go to the temple clinic and residence to find out.\u201d\u201cThen it would be enough for the people in the mansion, Lady Hestia,\u201d\u201cOkay. It\u2019s dangerous to get sick, so be sure to cover your nose and mouth with a thick cloth.\u201dDiseases that are prevalent in humid environments are usually waterborne diseases. I quickly added additional precautions.\u201cDrink water separately from what was prepared in the mansion. And you have to wash your hands and face clean with soap before coming into the mansion.\u201d\u201cI see. I will follow your instructions without fail.\u201dUross left me as soon as he wrote down the instructions.An investigation into the outbreak of the epidemic must have been carried out by state agencies.Nevertheless, the reason why I want to look into it separately is to understand the situation in the field that cannot be fully understood by documents alone.This is because I need to hold at least one more piece of information so that I can use it as a weapon that can be immediately returned when the temple tries to refute my attack in the future.I murmured again with admiration.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Erinnis came up with all these ideas\u2026.\u201dOf course, I may meet her as an enemy after the common goal of Diana disappears.But then I\u2019m not even sure what my existence will be like in this world.Therefore, I cannot afford to consider my life after that.I have no choice but to rush like a bison, just for the goal in front of me.I don\u2019t look back and reflect on my actions.I am not responsible for the consequences of my actions in the future.I belong to the world outside this novel.This is not my reality.Do whatever I want.I have no choice but to go ahead with what I want to make.~~~~One day, while we were preparing to fight against the temple while investigating the epidemic situation of ordinary people.Kaelus called me into the study.\u201cHestia, I got a call from the palace.\u201d\u201cThe imperial palace? Is it the prince?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201dUnknowingly, I distorted my face reflectively.But Kaelus, with his dry face, recited Helios\u2019 message.\u201cWhen I enter the palace for a political report, he said you should join me.\u201d\u201cMe too?\u201dIt was a little unexpected, so I was a little dazed for a while.It was a little unexpected, so I was a little dazed for a while. Helios called Kaelus and I together. Why?He nodded as if to answer me.\u201cI think you have something to talk about on public business.\u201d\u201cNo, I don\u2019t know anything about the country\u2026.\u201dInstinctively I edged back. What I know best is the original novel, not the execution of official duties!Kaelus laughed softly.\u201cThe other day, Heli said jokingly. \u2018I wish you and Hestia could attend a cabinet meeting together\u2019\u2026.\u201d\u201cWow, that\u2019s the creepiest joke I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201dI shook my head in disgust.\u201cAnyway, since the crown prince called me, it is too much to refuse such a reasonable excuse. It\u2019s better to approach gently.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI can\u2019t really tell what\u2019s in the head of that foxy kid.I thought I knew him well with my experience of binge-reading the original work several times, but there were some parts that I didn\u2019t expect when I encountered it in real life.How nice it is to be as simple as the heroine.\u201cWhen are you going\u2026?\u201dWhen I asked, showing that I didn\u2019t want to go all over my body, I got a dry answer.\u201cTomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Yes\u2026\u201dI bowed my head and turned around helplessly.I could hear a low laugh behind my back.~~~~The next day, we headed to the Lily Palace.This time, I was completely revealed without covering my face with a veil like last time.Seeing that the people I encounter are little by little surprised, it seems that something will soon circulate in society. For example, I\u2019ll be joining Kaelus in state affairs soon.Oh, it\u2019s a headache just to think about. I shook my head violently.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s just\u2026 It\u2019s because I\u2019m trying to get rid of all the miscellaneous thoughts.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dKaelus frowned slightly, but asked no more.Then we arrived in front of the office of Prince Helios. The servant who was guiding us went inside first. Then, again, he told us.\u201cPlease go in, marquis, marchioness.\u201dI bowed briefly, followed Kaelus into the office.A few times I came to see a familiar scene. Helios was sitting at his desk, as before, moving his pen. After raising his head and making eye contact with us, he put his pen down and leaned back in his chair.\u201cOh, you\u2019re here.\u201dInstead of a cumbersome manner, Helios raised his hand as usual and pointed to the sofa. We sat quietly accordingly.Two servants each came in with a tray. One was tea, and the other was surprisingly coffee.\u201c\u2026\u201dI alternately looked at the coffee kettle and Helios with a sour look.It\u2019s said that if you do something you\u2019ve never done before, bad things happen soon. What\u2019s wrong with this guy today?Kaelus\u2019 expressionless eyes also had a slight wonder.\u201cIs it for my wife?\u201d\u201cIt is well known that the marchioness enjoys coffee.\u201dI was so touched that my bias referred to me as \u201cwife,\u201d and because of Helios, who knew a long time ago that I usually drink coffee but spoke like it\u2019s new.I felt dizzy from the feeling of being beaten twice.Still, I have to pull yourself together. This never bodes well.\u201cWhat you have to say to me today must be very important. Otherwise, Your Highness wouldn\u2019t cater to my humble tastes.\u201dHelios frowned.\u201cI did you a favor in a long time, but is that the only reaction?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your grace. but you\u2019re different than usual, so I had to worry you were happy.\u201d\u201c\u2026if you can\u2019t speak\u2026.\u201dThe male lead clicked his tongue disapprovingly.Kaelus looked at Helios with a clean, dry expression as usual.\u201cYour highness the crown prince, is it something that Hess has to help with?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dHelios became a little embarrassed.I screamed inside again without a sound. Hess! My favorite called me Hess in front of Helios!Helios finally breathed a deep sigh.\u201cWell\u2026,it\u2019s actually because of the upcoming dinner with the foreign envoys.\u201dKaelus and I nodded almost at the same time.The foreign envoy refers to diplomats from other countries in the empire, that is, foreign ambassadors.The imperial emperor had to invite them once a year to have a grand dinner to strengthen diplomatic relations with each country.But unexpectedly, the problem must be at the very \u2018big\u2019 dinner.\u201cAs you know, the imperial princess is in charge of the imperial palace\u2019s events and ceremonies.\u201dThat sentence from Helios ended the whole explanation.If it\u2019s a dinner served by Princess Diana, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll ever speak.Kaelus looked at his old friend with dull eyes.\u201cHer highness the crown princess will be able to hold the event safely. Why did you call my wife and I at the same time?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios closed his mouth and looked at Kaelus. \u201cAre you really asking because you don\u2019t know?\u201dSomehow, if Kaelus\u2019s words sounded like they were\u00a0 provoking him, would it be too much for me to think about.I stared at the steaming cup of coffee.\u201c\u2026.\u201dSo this coffee was kind of a bribe. I mean, I want to get my hands on an important event that Diana\u2019s going to screw up.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say that you received a plan from the crown princess a few days ago?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you remember the last one? She made them pray to God to bless them.\u201dKaelus and Helios were having a rare quarrel.It seems that the two have already talked about the dinner more than once. Even so, it seems Helios had come to the conclusion that if he summoned me today, no matter how much he thought about it, it wouldn\u2019t be like that.If I cut in on a dinner that Diana had already planned.\u201c\u2026 Her highness will be angry, your highness the crown prince.\u201dThe two men stopped talking and turned to me.I tried to squeeze the tip of my lips that were about to twist.It\u2019s so funny.So this is what the gold-eyed kid is thinking. At a time when Diana and I are like enemies, it wouldn\u2019t make much difference if we put one more issue of being enemies.I clenched my teeth and said.\u201cThis is also related to the prestige of the royal family. I can\u2019t just mess around here.\u201dThere could be a backlash from conservative aristocrats. In other words, they may face unwanted backlash.Helios dragged his hands down his face.\u201cI know very well that I can\u2019t completely upset Diana\u2019s dinner plans. But I don\u2019t want to be misunderstood for neglecting diplomats.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNeither of us had immediate words to answer. I fully understood Helios\u2019 concerns.\u201cIs there any good way? I need your wisdom.\u201dHis voice was very earnest.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI looked at Helios coldly.This situation is very funny.Male lead Helios, expressed in the original, was simply a man with an invincible specification. No difficulty, no adverse conditions could prevent his will.But now.He complained of his grievances in the presence of his servants, and asked earnestly to share my wisdom.It wasn\u2019t like this before. Kaelus was simply a supporting role to help him, and Helios never bowed down to him for lack of ability.This was the end of the cheerful cider rofan, which had no headache and no emotion exhaustion .This was the end of the relationship, which I didn\u2019t worry about when I had to think about it and just enjoyed it ecstaticly.It serves you right.Then Kaelus opened his mouth.\u201cIf\u2026\u201dI quickly stopped my thoughts and looked at Kaelus\u2019 lips. The same goes for Helios.\u201cIf her highness changes it to a luncheon instead of a dinner, there will be a way.\u201d\u201cTell me in detail.\u201dHelios quickly opened his ears.\u201cEven if it\u2019s a little light, it won\u2019t be a big disrespect. Then why don\u2019t we move your meal to lunch and have dinner at our marquis, not at the palace?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dWhile Helios was being convinced, I pointed out the problem.\u201cBut, Kaelus, I think the weight is more on the dinner than the luncheon. And still, if we move to the marquis for dinner, will the crown princess accept it?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t take it completely.* But I think it\u2019s best to at least give the impression that our empire has done its best to diplomats.\u201d*TN: as in Hestia can\u2019t handle the whole lunchKaelus answered unshakably.I frowned and sarcastically said.\u201cAnd I have the worst relationship with her highness, so it doesn\u2019t matter if I add one more.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus didn\u2019t answer back.Then Helios burst in.\u201cIt\u2019s the worst for me.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201c?!\u201dAs the eyes of both of us gathered at once, Helios turned his head embarrassingly.\u201cAnyway, we\u2019d better follow the marquis\u2019s opinion. Let me know when you have a plan.\u201dThat\u2019s the end of the conversation.Me and Kaelus left Helios\u2019 room with an unidentified feeling.~~~~After leaving the office, I walked a few steps down the corridor of the Lily Palace, and finally I couldn\u2019t resist and stopped walking.\u201cKaelus, I\u2019m going to talk to the crown prince a little more.\u201d\u201c\u2026okay. I\u2019ll be waiting for you at the imperial palace library.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Thank you.\u201dI quickly kissed Caelus on the back of his hand, standing upright. Then I quickly turned around and headed back to the office.I can\u2019t possibly go home like this.I think I\u2019ll be able to sleep well tonight if I ask the prince a question.~~~~\u201cYour highness the crown prince, the marchioness is back.\u201dBefore the servant\u2019s words were finished, I entered with a rather profane sound of my shoes.Helios, who sat back in front of his desk, who was about to work, looked up at me.\u201cHmm? Hestia?\u201d\u201cYour highness, I\u2019m sorry, but I\u2019d like to speak with you privately for a moment.\u201dI asked in a stiff tone.Helios nodded and beckoned to the servant. Soon, only Helios and I were left in the office.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dInstead of answering immediately, I crept closer to the desk again.\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe golden eyes looked up at me in wonder. Although the eyes are pleasant with a sleek, beautiful jawline.\u201cWhy are you married?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d\u201cWhy did you choose our marquis as your opponent when you were obviously at odds with Her Highness Diana?\u201dMy voice rose little by little.\u201cI don\u2019t even know if Kaelus has completely shaken off the Holy Lady, but are you going to fight him? It\u2019s enough for me to fight her!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe golden eye of Helios was piercingly directed at me.\u201cI should be the only one rolling around in the mud! I don\u2019t want Kaelus in my fight with Diana! My husband, Kaelus\u2026!\u201dSomething kept choking up.For Kaelus, Diana was truly a beautiful first love. It was the first thing that taught him love. His precious and cherished memories.Even though he suffered death, Kaelus confessed to me. Diana may be the only love in his life.And yet why is this arrogant man willing to spoil it!\u201cYour highness won, so do you think you can throw it away now? Don\u2019t you think it\u2019s too shameless of you to push off the consequences to Kaelus, even if your relationship is the worst?\u201dI mean, it\u2019s a long way to go. Whether it burns or bursts, you two pull together and perish together.The eyes glared at Helios were full of force. Otherwise, I might cry.\u201cYou know what made him break up with your Highness\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026Hess, Hestia.\u201dUnexpectedly, there was no anger in the lips that opened with difficulty.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI stopped venting for now. I had to calm down properly before I became emotional.Helios\u2019 face was slightly distorted.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. There\u2019s no excuse.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m really\u2026 I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHis eyes sank lonely.\u201cTo you, and to Kael.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t call him Kael.\u201dI clenched my teeth.\u201cI asked you before, didn\u2019t I? How long are you going to clean up after the mess of the crown princess? But I didn\u2019t expect that answer to come back like this.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t handle everything, so you\u2019re going to kill the person who almost died and came back to life?\u201d Alas, forgive me for the rather shallow words. It\u2019s because I\u2019m from a lowly commoner and I just can\u2019t think of the right word.\u201dHelios looked at me for a long time, then slowly lowered his gaze.\u201c\u2026 Hestia. You\u2019re right.\u201dA weak voice followed.\u201cI have no shame. And yet there are no other ways. I have no choice but to reach out to you and your husband, even though I know this is shameless.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t leave it to anyone else. I\u2019ll never allow a nobleman other than your husband to stand up to Diana.\u201dHelios looked up at me again.\u201cBut you and Kaelus deserve it. You\u2019re the only ones who can blame us.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dComplex emotions that could not be defined by one thing crossed my heart.Compassion and pity in the midst of anger and bewilderment.Maybe it\u2019s because he apologized mildly, or because of his handsome face full of remorse.The intense emotions subsided little by little.\u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Hestia.\u201dA word of apology again.This time, I took it quietly without arguing.\u201c\u2026I see, your highness the crown prince.\u201dI bit my lip.I didn\u2019t come back to hold the dinner event itself anyway. If we get this much apology from Helios, we will get everything we can.There\u2019s still some intense emotional residue left, but that\u2019s it.I straightened myself up.Then Helios\u2019 voice was heard again.\u201cYou really don\u2019t care about fire and water.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI waited in silence for the next word.He laughed bitterly.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t really a lie to say that you love Kaelus.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI was dumbfounded and the way I spoke became pointy. I bent my upper body slightly toward him with a silly smile.\u201cThat\u2019s why you said you were jealous of him before?\u201dI put my face close to the gorgeous eyes, straight nose, and sleek jawline.The tip of the lip was pulled up at an angle.\u201cI guess you\u2019re jealous because I\u2019m pouring love onto my husband?\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe red lips were tightly closed and did not open.As I expected, I\u2019m not afraid to frown at this point, it\u2019s disrespectful, I deserve to express my displeasure.By the way.\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe golden eyes slowly fluctuated, and soon it shook like a strong wave!At that moment.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI got a chill down my spine.Something feels strange.Helios is weird.I instinctively backed away.\u201cHestia\u2026!\u201dHis extended hand swept through the air in vain.His face was grimly distorted. I just couldn\u2019t control my expression.\u201cWhat\u2026 are you crazy\u2026?\u201dOne\u2019s true intentions faintly echoed only at the tip of one\u2019s tongueHelios\u2019 figure standing in a daze.I can\u2019t stand it any longer.I ran away from the spot.~~~~\u201cGasp\u2026Gasp\u2026.\u201dI ran out of the office.My heart thumped violently. I was out of breath.My whole body trembled. Even my hands shook so hard that I couldn\u2019t even hold onto anything.\u201cMarchioness, are you okay?\u201dA servant who was nearby approached in wonder.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI bit my lip and barely nodded.I forcibly moved the immobile legs. I staggered, but took a step slowly.No way.This isn\u2019t right.How dare you.I kept murmuring in my mouth but I didn\u2019t know who I was talking to.\u201c\u2026.\u201dMy mind went blank.The strong scent of flowers around the Lily Palace came into my nose little by little.\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dYou have to pull yourself together.This is the palace. A place full of cats who will bite me if they get a chance.A viper\u2019s den where I should never be off guard.\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201dI clenched my teeth again.There will be no change in my journey to the end. I can do the same in the future, as I have done so far.\u201cLibrary\u2026 Let\u2019s go\u2026.\u201dKaelus said earlier that he would wait at the imperial palace library.Let\u2019s go that way.To the library.\u201cBut\u2026 which one was it?\u2026?\u201dIt wasn\u2019t as easy as I thought to get out of the panic that came at the moment. I talked to myself and tried to find my composure.Because I lost my sense of direction for a while, I went around the Lily Palace once before I knew it,by the way.\u201c\u2026!\u201dA man with long silver hair was seen over the bush.And opposite it, pink hair that\u2019s clearly invisible but reflected through the branches.Oh, right. Here.It\u2019s the Lily Palace.Another owner of this palace, Diana.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI swallowed my breath. I couldn\u2019t move as if I was frozen on the spot.I even stopped breathing in case they would hear me.I don\u2019t know the expression of Kaelus who is turning his back on me.I think I can hear a murmur of words.But I closed my ears.\u201c\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t want to listen.I don\u2019t want to step in.But what if Kaelus falls?I couldn\u2019t help but be nailed down.\u201c\u2026.\u201dBut how long am I going to stay like this?How am I going to deal with it if those two find me?I have to get out of hereI have to leave.I believe in Kaelus, who has become healthier.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dI clasped the hem of my skirt. Then I lifted it up to my knees so that I would not get caught.Sneak. Don\u2019t let it get caught.I ran away from where I was again.~~~~Somehow I returned to the entrance of the palace.I desperately grabbed the leash of reason and came to the palace library.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI lost strength as if I had a long marathon race.I could not go up all the stairs and sat down on the stairs, leaving the dignity of the aristocracy behind.\u201c\u2026.\u201dLet\u2019s wait like this.Kaelus isn\u2019t in that library anyway.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI tried not to think about anything as much as possible.I emptied my mind completely.I should enjoy the beautiful palace in front of me.\u201c\u2026\u201dI hope time goes by quickly.~~~~How long has it been?After staring blankly at the scenery for a long time, I finally saw Kaelus walking slowly in the distance.\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dOh, that\u2019s good.You came all the way here without falling down.I was truly relieved. I was worried if you were shocked by Diana\u2019s thoughtless words.\u201cKaelus.\u201dI smiled and waved.He slowed down. I brushed my skirt and stood up.\u201cYou weren\u2019t in the library\u2026.\u201dI approached him, bringing up the prepared excuse.\u201c\u2026?\u201dBut something is wrong. He doesn\u2019t look very well.My heart sank. I ran quickly and grabbed his hand.His hands are cold, too!Now that I see it, he can\u2019t even breathe properly!\u201c!\u201dI don\u2019t ask why. Because I already know.Instead, I quickly took out the medicine bottle from my handbag. And put it between his lips quickly and accurately.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Kaelus. It\u2019s okay now\u2026.\u201dI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m talking to my favorite or myself.I repeated it like a spell and didn\u2019t let go of his hand until Kaelus emptied the bottle cleanly.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dAs if to relax, his stiff body soon began to shake violently.I helped him down the stairs with all my might.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It\u2019s alright\u2026.\u201dMy favorite leaned his head on my shoulder.Leaving aside other thoughts, I tried my best to pat him and calm him down.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dToday is really.For my favorite and me.It was a hell of a day.\u201c\u2026Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dAfter a while, Kaelus, whose breathing was quite stable, opened his mouth. I responded without hesitation.\u201cShall we go back\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHis will is my will.I carefully supported him standing up.Whether someone told us about our situation sitting on the stairs or not, the marquis\u2019 carriage came to the library and stopped.The coachman jumped out of the carriage. With his help, I helped Kaelus first. Then, I got on, too.Seeing us safely seated, the coachman closed the door.Soon the carriage set off.\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus looked exhausted with his eyes closed.My heart throbbed.Damn Diana, you\u2019re bringing Kaelus back to this point, who was recovering at best.I spoke with my eyes closed as I was silently choking back my anger.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cCome here.\u201dKaelus puts his hand down next to him.To me, his words were law. I moved to his side without hesitation.Our hands clasped. It\u2019s a little warmer than before.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dA trembling sigh broke through his lips.While the carriage was running down the street, we didn\u2019t move.~~~~As soon as we arrived, the mansion quickly became noisy.The doctor came running, and the butler helped Kaelus.And the maids.\u201cMadam, let\u2019s go into the room. I\u2019ll hold you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dI was, in fact, completely groggy.Leaving the work to the faithful employees, I grabbed Clarice by the arm and struggled back to my room.\u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t even have the energy to be honest.As soon as Clarice left, I lay flat on the bed without changing my outfit.\u201c\u2026.\u201dSo many emotions are rushing by, I\u2019m all over the place.However, a group of maids immediately entered the room without having time to organize my minds.\u201cMadam, I\u2019ll change your clothes.\u201d\u201cPlease lie down as you are. We\u2019ll do it.\u201dThank you.Without a word, I closed my eyes and left myself to the ladies.\u201cMadam, it\u2019s done.\u201dI was just lying still, but before I knew it, my clothes changed to indoor clothes.Just in time, Clarice also carried a tray of tea. Soon, a fragrant smell of tea began to spread in the room.\u201cIt\u2019s a tea that helps you stay calm. Have some.\u201d\u201cAll right, Clarice.\u201dI slowly lifted up my heavy body.I got a hot cup in my hand. Then I carefully put it on my lips.\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe hot energy slowly spread through the body.I feel like I\u2019m going to live.The ladies left the room so that I could relax.Only then did it become quiet all around.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dReally.It was a stormy day.Lying in bed, I recounted what happened today.Helios called us to visit his office.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe asked for advice for the dinner for the foreign envoys Diana was in charge of.Then, I asked him why he made us fight with Diana.Helios apologized without excuse.\u201c\u2026Damn it\u2026\u201dThe swaying golden eyes rose again in front of me.I closed my eyes tightly as I rolled abuse in my mouth.Lunatic.A madman.No one else knows, but you shouldn\u2019t be swayed by me. You crazy male lead.I lay on my back nervously.No, what did I do?Who else has been so arrogant about him as I have been? I\u2019ve only heard a lot of people say it\u2019s disrespectful.But why!\u201cI don\u2019t know. I didn\u2019t see it. I\u2019m going to pretend I don\u2019t know.\u201dYeah, you don\u2019t have to worry.Helios wouldn\u2019t be expecting anything either. No, he doesn\u2019t deserve to be expecting in the first place.What I\u2019m praying for now is that Kaelus doesn\u2019t notice it.Never, ever, ever let Kaelus see your condition. You stupid male lead.Don\u2019t remind him of his trauma again after barely recovering from his daily routine. It\u2019s so hard that he can\u2019t even breathe dealing with Diana alone.I won\u2019t let you hurt my favorite more than this.\u201cKaelus, don\u2019t worry. Because I\u2019m here.\u201dI hope Kaelus will believe me.I\u2019ll never leave him until he leaves me first.~~~~After dinner, I asked Uross, the butler who was standing to serve me.\u201cHow\u2019s Kaelus?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been sleeping since he saw his doctor.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026.\u201dI came back to my room and finished washing my face.All you have to do is go to bed.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dIt keeps bothering me.I tossed and turned in bed and eventually sat up.\u201cIt\u2019s okay to peek\u2026?\u201dIf I\u2019m careful not to make a noise, I won\u2019t wake Kaelus.When I made up my mind, it was easy to act.I crept open the door. In the dark hallway, only the taillights dimly light up the darkness.I feel like I\u2019ve become a thief. I walked cautiously through the hallway, trying not to make any noise as much as possible.His bedroom was slightly open. A man seemed to be standing by while Kaelus was sleeping inside.The principle of \u201cI will not leave you alone\u201d is still not being broken. Great people.I paced quietly outside the door, so that he wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201c\u2026?\u201dI smiled awkwardly at the servant who came out quietly.We exchanged words in a whisper.\u201cIs he sleeping?\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Would you like to go in?\u201d\u201cThen wait a minute\u2026.\u201dI walked quietly into the bedroom.\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus was fast asleep.There was no movement to the point where I think he must have died if it wasn\u2019t for the regular breathing sound.I sat down carefully by the bed. Luckily, he didn\u2019t wake up.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe\u2019s sleeping beautifully, my favorite.I\u2019m relieved to see you sleeping soundly.How nervous he must have been to meet Diana earlier. He ran into it when he was alone, so it would have been better if I were next to him.It\u2019s my fault that I left him for nothing to argue with Helios. It seems like I have some loose screws.The more you do this, the more you shouldn\u2019t be careless.I can\u2019t forgive my mistake of forgetting for a moment that Diana was freely wandering Lily Palace and getting angry at Helios.This is why people should be cool about everything. Emotions ruin everything.It\u2019s a pity that he endured it, otherwise I wouldn\u2019t have regretted it so much.\u201c\u2026.\u201dLooking at my favorite, who still didn\u2019t move, I apologized to him.I\u2019m sorry, Kaelus.This won\u2019t happen in the future. I won\u2019t make a mistake again.After apologizing in my heart, I rose up, careful not to make a sound.\u201c\u2026.\u201dKaelus with his eyes closed like a sculpture.Lovely.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s so sad that I\u2019m just watching.He won\u2019t know because he\u2019s been sleeping for a long time, right?\u201c\u2026.\u201dOn the forehead of my favorite, I put a kiss on it.I did it very lightly.You didn\u2019t feel anything at all, did you?But is he alive? When did he stop breathing?I thought it was noisy just a moment ago.That\u2019s weird.I tilted my head.But if you sleep deeply, well, maybe. You may have sleep apnea then.I crept out of the room like I did when I came in.\u201cI didn\u2019t wake him up.\u201dI whispered to the servsnts outside. They smiled and nodded.I came back to my room quietly.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dNow I\u2019m going to sleep comfortably.~~~~It was the next day.I asked Clarice, who was waiting for breakfast at the dining hall.\u201cKaelus, did he wake up?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s awake, but the doctor said he needs to rest all day today.\u201d\u201cI thought so. I\u2019ll have to convince him not to go out for a while.\u201dAfter returning to politics, Kaelus often had to go out. However, due to yesterday\u2019s incident, I felt like he had to maintain a cautious daily life for a while.I headed to his room.\u201cKaelus?\u201d\u201cHess.\u201dHe was sitting in bed drinking watery soup for a meal.When I showed up, the servant and the doctor walked away quietly. I sat next to the bed with the tray that the servant had left behind.\u201cEat slowly.\u201dHe looked at me and nodded slowly.\u201cYou\u2019d better rest at home for the time being. Cancel your plans to go out as much as possible, and if necessary, I\u2019ll be there for you.\u201d\u201c\u2026 your share of the work will increase. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dThere was no energy in his voice.I immediately waved my hand.\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I\u2019m actually sorry. I left you alone yesterday because I let my guard down\u2026\u201dI have no excuse for that. I made a ridiculous mistake. I can\u2019t bear to raise my head.\u201cI forgot for a moment that it was the Lily Palace.\u201d\u201cHestia, it\u2019s not your fault.\u201dKaelus put down the soup bowl. Then, he waved his hand to indicate that he had no intention of eating more.\u201cYou ate too little.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something more important than that now.\u201dPurple eyes turned to me with a serious glow.Is it because of me again?I shouldn\u2019t have come when he was eating, and now I\u2019m even interrupting his meal.To what extent am I going to cause inconvenience?I\u2019m a human being.\u201c\u2026Hess.\u201dAnother hand held the hand that had no place to go.\u201cYesterday, I met Diana.\u201dI know. I\u2019ve seen it myself.\u201cDid she say anything else that stung you?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not. But rather\u2026.\u201dKaelus tilted his head slightly to the side.\u201cShe asked me how I was doing.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dThere is nothing but a fake laugh that seemed too transparent.Now that she\u2019s fallen out with Helios, she\u2019s starting to think of the sweet old Kaelus. She almost buried everything she had done to Kaelus, and approached him gently and tried to be as good as before.Do you still have sweet water left to suck?* If you want to cheat, divorce first, Diana.*TN: is there any kindness left from Kaelus?No, before that, you have to kneel down and apologize to him.\u201cDid the Saintess apologize to you?\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t say exactly that.\u201d\u201cOh, she\u2019s so shameless.\u201dBut Kaelus\u2019 expression was strange.\u201cKael\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s strange\u2026.\u201dHe laughed bitterly.\u201cYou\u2019ll probably be very disappointed to hear this.\u201d\u201cIt won\u2019t happen.\u201dI made a firm statement.Nevertheless, he could not easily open his mouth and Kaelus hesitated.I think I should open the water a little bit.\u201cYou were happy, weren\u2019t you? It\u2019s unfair and cruel to think about the past, but on the other hand, it must have been nice. Right?\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s right.\u201dHe bowed his head and affirmed.\u201cHaha, that\u2019s natural. It\u2019s because you really did your best to love without regrets. It\u2019s nothing to be disappointed about.\u201dIn the meantime, Kaelus has concluded that Diana was just his first love and that his relationship with her was completely over.He emphasized it to me over and over again. There\u2019s no way he\u2019s going to connect with her again.But when he actually met her, and the moment she smiled at him as gently as before instead of showing hostility.The firm conclusion must have experienced confusion that shook all over.\u201cI\u2019m a fool\u2026?\u201dHe asked with a lonely smile.I shook my head firmly.\u201cNo, it\u2019s perfectly normal.\u201dNevertheless, Kaelus\u2019 eyes sank melancholy.\u201cI know. I\u2019m stupid.\u201d\u201cKael\u2026.\u201d\u201cI know how useless it is to hold on to a finished love affair, but it doesn\u2019t cut off like a knife.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m still hurt, but I can\u2019t be cool with it. Emotions are getting in my way. I\u2019ve come to a conclusion so many times.\u201dKaelus felt as if he could get his hands on it.In fact, this is very common.Even in a broken-up relationship, like Kaelus, when you end a one-sided love but face the other again after some time.The painful past memories are scattered like mirages, and the excitement of the past is revived regardless of yiur intention.That\u2019s why some lovers break up countless times and rejoin, and others becomes a fish trapped in a fishing ground.The feeling of love is completely different from the logic that can be explained objectively.I asked cautiously.\u201cAre you disappointed?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dKaelus replied weakly.I have a throbbing pain in my chest.That\u2019s why Kaelus was in so much pain yesterday.Even though he learned a lesson after experiencing it to the point where his daily life completely collapsed, he must have not known that the lesson would fly away in ridiculous vain.But love, by nature, is like that.Covering up all the faults that have piled up.It\u2019s love to focus on the other person and naturally forget about your past feelings.\u201cKaelus. Love, you did it right.\u201dI smiled softly.\u201cThe love that you have to be happy all the time \u00a0 is, frankly, not love. It\u2019s just a pretty prop that will shine your life.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what love is all about. It\u2019s not love, it\u2019s calculation, whether it\u2019s good or bad for you.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026?\u201d\u201cOf course. It\u2019s nothing to blame if you were happy to see her again, even though you were suffering so much because of the saintess.\u201dIf only I could lift the rock on my favorite\u2019s heart and move it.I comforted him with all my heart.\u201cBecause you truly loved her, it didn\u2019t matter what you suffered.\u201dTo make a loved one a top priority in life. In that case, I am naturally relegated to the lower ranks.People who are skeptical about love usually do so in this part. When you\u2019re blind looking at the other person and realize that you\u2019ve completely forgotten yourself.But what love is it that gives you a heart that doesn\u2019t hurt you or lose you?It\u2019s just cheap self-satisfaction. Pretty decorations that will enrich your life, nothing more or less.Love, originally, is to throw all your life away.Like a fool.\u201cKaelus, as I said before, I don\u2019t want you to force yourself to forget Diana.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s less painful to keep her in your arms, I think it\u2019s better to do that.\u201dMy favorite\u2019s white face stared at me.\u201cBut if you want your relationship to develop in real life\u2026.\u201dI stretched out my two fingers.\u201cThere is a prerequisite. First, Diana will divorce the Crown Prince.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026!\u201d\u201cAnd the other one. She has to apologize for her harsh criticism of you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus closed his mouth with a stern look.I shook my head.\u201cOtherwise, she can always hurt you deeply again for the same reason. I\u2019ll never see to that.\u201d\u201cHestia, that will never happen. I\u2019m completely done with Diana.\u201dHe took my hand and lifted it.\u201cAnd now I\u2019m married. I\u2019m not such a mess that I want to get along with another woman over my wife.\u201d\u201cHa ha, Kaelus\u2026.\u201dI tapped my hand with the other.\u201cOn paper, a couple is not a real couple.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I\u2026.\u201dI paused for a moment, but I held myself together and continued.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going to lose my powers in about a year. I don\u2019t know what will happen to me then\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThere was a heavy silence.\u201c\u2026\u2026Yes, that\u2019s right. I mean, there\u2019s a time when there\u2019s no future in sight.\u201d\u201cBut before that, I will accomplish all my goals. There is plenty of time.\u201d\u201cAnd then?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI deliberately pretended not to know and asked back. A sharp stab in the heart.Kaelus\u2019 purple snow sank seriously.\u201cJust because you don\u2019t see your future doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s all over.\u201d\u201cHaha, of course. It\u2019s not the end of the world.\u201dI tried to smile and answer back.\u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant, Hestia.\u201dA gradual hardening of voice.Alas. I also don\u2019t want you to fall for the shallow jokes.His grip on my hand gave me strength.\u201cI\u2019m asking you what you\u2019re going to do after you lose your foresight. Unless it means you\u2019re going to die.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026.\u201dI blurted out the end of my words.To be honest, I never thought about it. I didn\u2019t have the foresight, I just returned in time.What is the premise of a return from a rofan novel? I mean, it\u2019s death.The reason why I don\u2019t have more \u2018predictions\u2019 is because I died then. What\u2019s the use of future plans after death?More than that, how did the story go in this direction? Obviously, didn\u2019t Kaelus start by meeting Diana?I can\u2019t handle it. At this rate, he\u2019ll find out my secret.I should avoid it first.\u201cWell, I\u2019ll think about it when I get back to my room\u2026\u201dI let go of his hand. I stood up and tried to leave the room.However, the legs that were moving froze at the cool voice.\u201cHess.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe cold purple eyes turned to me.\u201cYou\u2019re running away like this because you know what I mean.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cNext time I ask you again, please give me the answer I expect.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dHis tight-lipped expression somehow looked sad.I\u2019m sorry, too. But really, I\u2019ve never painted my life after it\u2019s all over.**TN: as in she has no idea what she wants to do after her death in the previous lifeI hope I can give him a clearer answer next time, as he wished.A \u201cclear\u201d answer.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBecause Kaelus has to refrain from going out for a while and relax at home, I am in charge of meeting the crown prince at the palace.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dSo I\u2019m annoyed.I changed my mind while trying to wear a hat with a veil.Keep your eyes open and face Helios. I\u2019ll have to make sure that what I sensed on that day is true.Before leaving for the palace, I stopped by Kaelus\u2019 room.\u201cI\u2019ll be right back. I\u2019ll deliver this document and get the foreign envoy\u2019s event plan?\u201dThe face of Kaelus in glasses turned to me.\u201cOkay, be careful.\u201d\u201cHa ha. All right.\u201dA glasses wearing version of my favorite instantly purified my irritating mood.My favorite is the panacea for everyday life.~~~~The Lily Palace that I visited again was still surrounded by flowers. Somehow, it felt more colorful than before.\u201cYou must have told them that the dinner was turned into a luncheon, right?If this colorful garden of flowers was cultivated by Diana for dinner with the foreign envoys.\u201c\u2026Well, did it work out for lunch?\u201dThe color of the flowers can be seen better during the day than at night.I visited Helios\u2019 office without a care. The guard guarding the door recognized my face and quickly went inside. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t veil myself.\u201cPlease go in, Marchioness Hestia.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter a short greeting, I walked in with my back straight.\u201cAre you here?\u201dHelios didn\u2019t even look up to process the documents.I hope you look into people\u2019s eyes and talk. That way, I can check if I saw something wrong that day.\u201cMy husband\u2019s health is not good today, so I came instead.\u201dThe document was placed gently on his desk.He replied, still looking at the other papers.\u201cI see. I\u2019ll check later.\u201d\u201cAnd I have something to say about the marquis\u2019 dinner. I\u2019d like to get a plan for the luncheon prepared by her majesty the crown princess.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s here.\u201dHelios opened the drawer, took out a file, and put it on the desk with his eyes still elsewhere.\u201c\u2026\u201dI know for sure at this point.He\u2019s avoiding my eyes now.I packed the file. But I didn\u2019t back down immediately and stood there.\u201c\u2026?\u201dThen male lead raised his head, revealing his golden eyes.I grinned.\u201cYou\u2019re barely looking at me.\u201d\u201c\u2026 anything to say?\u201dAn expressionless face and immovable eyes.It looks calm at first glance, but I can tell from my experience.Helios is struggling to look like he\u2019s okay now.As expected, I wasn\u2019t mistaken that day.\u201c\u2026\u201dWhat should I do? Should I just close my eyes and guess at this point?I made up my mind to pretend I didn\u2019t know. Besides, he\u2019s trying so hard that he can\u2019t ignore it.All right, let\u2019s do that.In the end, instead of prying into the day, I brought up something else.\u201cWell, can you move your office to the Lion Palace?\u201d\u201cMy office? Why?\u201dThe golden eyes were slightly drained of strength. He seemed relieved, too.I answered with my eyes down.\u201cThe other day, my husband faced her royal highness alone in this lily palace. He had a seizure that day and was still in bed until today.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid this will happen often in the future, so I\u2019m asking you to do it, although it\u2019s difficult. You are in charge of state affairs as the emperor\u2019s representative, so you may serve in the Lion Palace.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHelios shook his head.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m honored, Your Highness. I\u2019m going to go now.\u201dI\u2019m going to be polite and leave.\u201c\u2026How\u2019s the marquis?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s much better. In a few days, I\u2019ll take care of the affairs again.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dHe seemed to have nothing more to say.I bowed slightly and left the office quickly.~~~~When I got home, I took out the files Helios gave me.An event plan consisting of three or four sheets of dangling paper.\u201cTsk\u2026.\u201dI had no choice but to click my tongue. Although it was an annual event hosted by the imperial palace and a large event inviting foreign ambassadors, the plan written by Diana was too poor.\u201cThe school festival must be more detailed than this.\u201dMost of the items were written as \u2018only for the temple\u2019.I couldn\u2019t believe it. What are you going to do if you leave everything to the temple?\u201cThen what is prepared in the temple\u2026.\u201dFortunately, the last page of the paper was accompanied by a plan for the temple.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dWhat a relief.It starts with a ritual presided over by the new shrine, and the meal menu is mainly vegetables. Lastly, let\u2019s say thank you to God again.That\u2019s a natural result. It\u2019s an event hosted by the temple. It\u2019ll all be like this.This will inevitably put more weight on the dinner hosted by the marquis.The burden that Kaelus and I bear increases that much.\u201c\u2026 This is really beyond me\u2026.\u201dI\u2019m an ordinary little citizen who really knows nothing but to use the knowledge I read in the original novel.I\u2019m trying to make a secondary creation that the heroine regrets, but in reality, I\u2019m just an ordinary person who enjoys reading rofans.I should probably ask Kaelus for help before I make a bigger accident.~~~~Kaelus was in his study.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d\u201c?\u201dHesitatingly, he held out Diana\u2019s plan before him.\u201cIt will be hard for me alone. I\u2019ve never had such a big event before\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dHe nodded coolly and took the papers and began to read.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026It\u2019s serious, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to make up for the dinner.\u201dKaelus let out a false laugh.I was relieved to hear that he would help me anyway.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be exactly the same as the one held at the palace. It\u2019s enough to show the full veneration of the aristocracy.\u201d\u201cReally? How long has it been since you had such a big party in this house?\u201d\u201c\u2026 When I was young\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDamn it. I got it wrong. Kaelus knew nothing but in theory after all.\u201cWe can prepare it together, Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dIt seems that we should at least send a rescue signal to Erinnis and Harmonia.\u201cHmph. Don\u2019t you trust me?\u201d\u201cNo, believe me.\u201dI should do it secretly.~~~~Fortunately, however, two veterans in the house were willing to step up without seeking outside help.The butler Uross and the maid Clarice were called by Kaelus.\u201cIt\u2019s a dinner for foreign envoys\u2026.\u201dUross nodded as if it were not a big deal.\u201cHow many people are invited? If possible, please let me know their nationality. I\u2019m going to decorate the dining room as much as I can.\u201d\u201cThere will be about five people. The nationality varies from guest to guest. We\u2019ll bring vegetarian lunch from the palace, so the dinner table should be more colorful.\u201dKaelus calmly pointed out the essential points.\u201cYou can use the help of tailor Tekima for interior decoration. His job is related to clothes, but I think he has a knack for it.\u201d Clarice said with a smile.\u201cOh, that\u2019s a good idea.\u201dI agreed with her.I glanced at Kaelus in the face. I was worried about what I would do alone when you asked me if I didn\u2019t trust you, but I solved the difficult problem nicely by asking for help appropriately.In the original novel, it was Kaelus who always showed the appearance of a supporting actress who worked hard alone. While Helios was hosting a romance full of flowers with Diana, Kaelus was a grateful being that made readers outside the novel not have to worry about a problem in state affairs.The role of a capable second lead in the rofan was generally similar. Even while Helios and Diana were dating late at night, he worked alone, and even if Helios was away from the palace to help Diana for a long time, he always kept Helios\u2019 vacancy.Thanks to this, writers and readers can focus only on the male and female leads who loved sweetly.But if life is no longer a novel.There is no main character who can fill all the gaps by himself.Kaelus never dreamed that this world was a novel, but he accepted his world that had changed completely naturally and reached out to his surroundings.**TN: this is not saying he\u2019s aware he\u2019s in a novel. It\u2019s saying he would never think about it and that he accepted that his world has changed.\u201cNo problem. The dinner will be a success.\u201dUross and Clarice smiled.I can\u2019t thank the two reliable people enough.~~~~After the discussion, the butler and the maid returned to their seats.I snapped out of my thoughts to go back slowly.\u201cHestia. Wait.\u201d\u201c?\u201dThere was no major change in the expression on the face of Kaelus, who called out to me.But the words from the lips were very serious.\u201cYou said you\u2019d think about it before, did you come to a conclusion?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026? Oh\u2026.\u201dHe\u2019s quite persistent. Is it such an important matter after the prophecies disappears?I\u2019ll have to answer roughly. So he won\u2019t ask me again.\u201cI\u2019ll just do it if I can live like this, and if I can\u2019t, I\u2019ll find another way.\u201dHe wrinkled his eyebrows slightly. He didn\u2019t seem to like something about it.But I didn\u2019t catch it immediately.\u201cIn this situation, nothing will change.\u201d\u201cYes, yes, yes, yes. Haha\u2026.\u201dFrankly, I don\u2019t entirely agree with Kaelus.I don\u2019t think anything will change here right now, but isn\u2019t it life that you don\u2019t even know what\u2019s going on tomorrow?\u201cThen I\u2019ll go back. Call me again if you need anything.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dIn the end, the wrinkled forehead did not straighten out.I\u2019m sorry, my favorite. I couldn\u2019t give you the answer you wanted.~~~~The fact that the invitation of foreign ambassadors to the imperial palace was changed to a luncheon event soon spread quickly to the social world.I heard the complaints of the nobles from Harmonia in the salon.\u201cLunch and dinner are different from the way you dress. The nobles who had been preparing to attend from a long time ago were a little embarrassed.\u201dHarmonia had an embarrassing smile.I nodded my head.\u201cI fully understand. But why would the crown prince have decided that? Apparently the crown princess didn\u2019t even ask madam for any help.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026 she said she would discuss it with the priests of the temple\u2026.\u201dHarmonia was also bitter.Finally, the strong bond between the two, which has continued since the original novel, has been broken.It was Harmonia, which supported Diana\u2019s entrance to the palace in both physical and mental ways. She was the one who taught the hostess etiquette and taught her how to win the fight against the nobles.In fact, Harmonia did not let go of her affection for Diana until the end. But Diana, already suspicious of her \u201crebellion,\u201d arranged her relationship with Harmonia gracefully and coldly like a nobleman.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the number of new officials has increased significantly.\u201dHarmonia\u2019s eyes were once again lonely at my words.\u201cMost of the women in the Lily Palace have also been replaced by those from the new building. The crown prince moved his office to the Lion Palace, and the replacement was done more quickly.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026.\u201dHelios took what I said only once quite seriously. To a certain extent, I visited the palace and put it into practice the next day.When I first found out about this, I was a little dumbfounded. I know you\u2019ve been shaken by me for a moment, and you trust my opinion more than Diana\u2019s, but this is too immediate.Anyway, it seems that it is not an exaggeration to say that the relationship with Diana was the worst.I wonder what society thinks of this situation.\u201cYou know the relationship between the crown prince and his wife is unusual these days, right, madam?\u201d\u201cDid you already know, marchioness?\u201dHarmonia sighed heavily.\u201cThe impatient nobles are already talking about the abdication of the crown princess.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI pretended to be worried and burst out laughing inside. Everything is going well.\u201cIf someone takes the lead and starts a public debate, it\u2019s an atmosphere where everyone seems to stick together. Her Highness Diana should be aware of this situation\u2026\u201dThe depressed madam said furtively.\u201cHave you sent a letter?\u201d\u201cYes, but I didn\u2019t get a reply.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dDiana\u2019s bad habits. If she thinks you did something wrong, she\u2019ll throw you away without giving you a second chance.Kaelus was abandoned, and now Harmonia is also a victim.\u201cMadam, how much public opinion has gathered about the disclosure of the temple\u2019s property?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re slowly gaining momentum, marchioness.\u201dShe answered with a dark complexion.\u201cAs the priests begin to take over the palace, the aristocracy is becoming more wary. There are also explicit calls to discourage people before they get bigger.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great. I\u2019m doing a separate investigation, so if you combine it with it and make it public all at once, it\u2019ll be quite powerful.\u201dI smiled.\u201cDid you do any research?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m collecting data on accounting irregularities. There\u2019s a report that they\u2019re not doing their job as a temple, but focusing on accumulating wealth.\u201dThere are no internal accusations, but since there\u2019s no organization that doesn\u2019t come out of dust by wiping it off, it\u2019s probably apt.**TN: there\u2019s no group that can come out of a disaster by just shaking it offHarmonia\u2019s expression became more serious. I raised my voice even higher.\u201cThe plague among the people. The temple is not working hard because of its inertia, so the chaos is not subsiding.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dShe sighed heavily again. Then she looked at me and said,\u201cOn the other hand, the Illion estate is rumored to be safe. Thanks to the well-maintained sewerage and the motivated soap.\u201d\u201cHahaha, I\u2019m embarrassed to hear it like this.\u201dIt\u2019s very embarrassing to hear the compliments I spread with my ears.\u201cThanks to my husband\u2019s decision. Both of them are projects that require a lot of money, so I thought a lot about it.\u201dNevertheless, Harmonia\u2019s expression was not very bright.I thought I knew the reason, so I sneaked out my innermost thoughts.\u201cAre you worried that my investigation will harm the crown princess?\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s like she thinks Diana is a child. Of course, characters don\u2019t change easily.I giggled.\u201cIn the end, it\u2019s good for the crown princess, too. We have to shake off the temple as soon as possible. How long can she live as a saintess?\u201dIn fact, this is a very sensitive matter.The emperor was still not in state affairs. Even for the crown prince\u2019s successor class, the period was too long.The aristocratic society has already noticed. That the emperor\u2019s health is extraordinary.Even though there was a saintess right next to him, not getting better meant two possibilities. The first is that the emperor has become so old that he cannot be helped by the holy power. And secondly, there is an abnormality in the healing power of the saintess.People\u2019s guesses were generally inclined for the second one.The emperor is still less than 60 years old. Considering that aristocrats of that age are still active showing off their health, it is widely speculated that there may be a problem with the saintess.But who dares to drag a holy being blessed by God down? In addition, the emperor\u2019s support for the saintess remained steadfast.I said as if I were soothing.\u201cWhen you find out that the temple has committed irregularities, I\u2019m sure the crown princess will also want to correct the mistakes. Look at my husband\u2019s case. No matter how close you are, she points out that fault is fault.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cHer highness can\u2019t look at injustice. So it\u2019s good for her as well, it\u2019s no harm.\u201dShe\u2019s Diana, who sticks to her beliefs without her friends. They\u2019re just friends of the temple. Well, they\u2019re not better than Kaelus.Therefore, if Diana is abandoning Kaelus, she must be able to abandon the temple without hesitation. Don\u2019t you think so?What if you don\u2019t throw it away and hug it?That\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for, a picture of you two sinking together.I don\u2019t want Diana to abandon her original character. What do you mean, repentance for cider rofan?Even though I felt this way, I comforted Harmonia for now.\u201cMadam also needs to be cool-headed. If you really want to help the crown princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026Marchioness is right.\u201dHarmonia let out a heavy sigh.Whatever her feelings for her, she seems to be trying to fail in the end of losing Diana. Even if I can\u2019t help her right by her side, I\u2019ll watch her sadly from afar.They are just too much for Kaelus, Harmonia and Diana.How can the fate of the supporting actors who were doing good to Diana without any conditions be so consistent?Dummy Diana won\u2019t realize until she loses everything.\u201cThe world didn\u2019t revolve around her, the world did her a favor.\u201d~~~~When I came home from the salon, a letter arrived for me.\u201cErinnis?\u201dAs if writing it in a hurry and sending it, the handwriting was not very neat.But the content was incredible.\u201cThe date of the merchant ship\u2019s departure has been decided\u2026?!\u201dI crumpled up the letter.\u201c!\u201dSo Diana got the money and dedicated it to Potos! That\u2019s a lot of money for the ship to sail right away!The merchant ship will soon sink. Baron Potos and his family will run away at night. Or even if Helios, who knows the prophecy, stops the night flight, they\u2019re already broke.It\u2019s already been decided. Diana cannot recoup her investment.\u201cIt\u2019s finally time\u2026!\u201dBy the time the merchant ship departs, the accusation data of the temple, which is being scratched, will also be quite thick. She will experience how little things are interpreted and attacked by people like me who have a \u2018specific purpose.\u2019The epidemic rate, which is similar to that of previous years, will be considered as a massive disaster when compared to the situation in Illion.Even if she tries hard to make excuses that she is doing what she normally does, she will not be able to make a living. The injustice of the temple that I worked hard to prepare will be revealed in a timely manner in public.A rational explanation does not work for the angry public. The holy woman and the temple will suffer a blow that will not be easily restored.Feel the magic of all the support of the people who supported them.The temple\u2019s warehouses will be empty as well. Of course, a devout believer among them may still give money for God, but it\u2019s done on a personal level, so I have to accept it.\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dI hummed my pen. I quickly completed a thank-you reply to Erinnis.Oh, I\u2019m going crazy.I want to face Diana alone in a place where no one can see.Am I really looking forward to it? What kind of face will Diana have when she sees me?I want to feel the true heart of Diana as it is. Quite frankly, without any embellishment. Without anyone caring.If she did, I could also show a little bit of my real purpose.\u201cI hope we can sail soon. Whoo-hoo\u2026.\u201dWhen meticulously set traps explode at once.I\u2019ll be happy to drink soda while watching the fireworks go off.For the hostess seated in the splendid court palace.~~~~Fortunately, Kaelus recovered much faster than before.While I was preparing for the ambassador invitation dinner with the help of the butler, the maid, and Tekima, he went to the palace every day to deal with the ever-present rush of affairs.How fortunate that Helios moved his office quickly to the Lion Palace.Thanks to this, Kaelus was able to enter and exit the palace safely without encountering Diana.My butler, Uross, and I deliberately chose the menu for the dinner. Since Diana\u2019s luncheon menu is mainly vegetarian, to differentiate ourselves, we decided to make fish and meat the main dish, and to add plenty of vegetable dishes.The most important thing is dessert. Diana was particularly keen on desserts, so eating delicious desserts at the palace became a very difficult task.Therefore, the winning place is right here.\u201cWe need to make as many kinds of desserts as possible. I want some to be wrapped so that some of the VIPs can take it back.\u201dI think the butler agreed.\u201cAlright, ma\u2019am. And they brought in some of the finest chocolates from a trading shop. The patissier will show his skill on the day.\u201d\u201cOh, how much chocolate is there? I\u2019d like to make it fall like a waterfall, if possible.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s a great idea. If we don\u2019t have enough, I\u2019ll buy more and do that.\u201dUnlike the royal luncheon, which also involves nobles, the dinner has no guests other than Prince Helios and ambassadors from each country.Therefore, it was better to make it more private. In addition to wine added to the meal, we decided to add colorful cocktails.\u201cMake sure you get a good bartender. If they refuse because they have another schedule, you have to give them more money to bring it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do that. Then, how far should we open the dining room?\u201d\u201cIf the weather permits, we will include not only the grand banquet room on the first floor, but also the garden and the backyard. Please guide the guests so that they do not go up to the second floor.\u201d\u201cYes, Lady Hestia. I\u2019ll keep that in mind.\u201dThis time, I headed to the banquet room, which will be used as a dining room. Clarice and Tekima, were looking hard at something with a serious look on their face.\u201cHow\u2019s it going?\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re here, ma\u2019am?\u201dThe two handed me the drawing they were looking at.\u201cMadam, the palace\u2019s luncheon atmosphere is quite heavy and serious, so I\u2019m going to decorate the dining room a little lightly.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a good direction. But you should also consider Kaelus\u2019 taste. It\u2019s light, but try not to be too flashy.\u201d\u201cYes, marchioness. So I\u2019d like to make the curtain material chiffon instead of velvet, what do you think?\u201d\u201cHmm, if you layer several sheets, it feels elegant and light. All right.\u201dI added with a grin.\u201cThe budget we need will come from the palace anyway. Don\u2019t spare it and use it to your heart\u2019s content.\u201d\u201cHahaha, I see.\u201dClarice and Tekima\u00a0 also laughed at each other.I\u2019ll make up my mind and write it down. I\u2019ll show you a different level of consumption.~~~~Finally, that day, Kaelus and I attended the royal luncheon, but I was the only one who left first, and finally checked the preparation for the dinner, and decided to greet the VIPs at home.Kaelus stayed in his seat until the luncheon aas over. The marquis couple, the highest aristocrats, cannot all disappear during the event.The only gathering we went to as husband and wife was a concert hosted by Countess Erinnis. It was virtually the first official event of this scale.But with no excitement, we arrived at the palace almost in combat.\u201cI hope the atmosphere won\u2019t be too rigid, Kaelus.\u201dI murmured anxiously.The imperial palace event, in which Diana takes center stage and the priests take charge of actual affairs. I can\u2019t tell whether this is a temple ceremony or a social event.Will I be able to build friendship while laughing in that air?But Kaelus was calm.\u201cI heard that the emperor will join us for a short time. The attention of the nobles will be focused on the condition of bis majesty, so the atmosphere itself will not matter much.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026.\u201dAs he said, today\u2019s viewing point was other than a pious (?)* luncheon.*TN: Hestia is confused on how to label the luncheonIt\u2019s the appearance of the emperor.It was him who hadn\u2019t appeared in public for many months. He quietly devoted himself to recuperation at the Lion Palace, leaving most of the political affairs to Prince Helios.Still, the power succession took place without much confusion. It was thanks to the fall of the Duke Orcus, a leader of the aristocracy.Therefore, the problem arose elsewhere, not in relation to the succession of the throne.Due to the Emperor\u2019s long illness, people began to doubt Diana\u2019s divine power. To make matters worse, Diana\u2019s relationship with Helios, the only corner to lean on, had deteriorated.As Harmonia mentioned, the nobles gradually questioned the existence of the present crown princess.This is because two important elements that pushed Diana, a commoner, into the royal family have disappeared. The healing power bestowed by God and the ardent affection of the crown prince.The change of the event into a luncheon due to the intervention of the marquis was also a challenge to the authority of the crown princess. Although we did it at the request of Helios, others would have considered it another meaning.However, Diana did not directly complain to us about this. Helios could have blocked it in the middle.If so, there is a possibility that she will express her uncomfortable intention with anything she faces today.Especially when Kaelus remains alone after I leave the palace for dinner.\u201cWell, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cHmm?\u201d\u201cBy any chance, when I\u2019m away, the crown princess may ask you to talk.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cIf you can\u2019t handle it, don\u2019t face it.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, I\u2019ll remember.\u201dHe answered slowly.~~~~The banquet hall of the Lily Palace, where the luncheon will be held, was as calm as a chapel.\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHe seems to be so cautious that it is difficult to greet him with a welcoming voice. It\u2019s really like a temple.Still, when we appeared, they began to murmur little by little that the highest aristocrat of the empire had appeared.When people approached and greeted us first, we also gave a ceremonial reply.Countess Erinnis approached with a strange smile.\u201cI expected it, but it\u2019s really better than I expected, marchioness.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s all white.\u201dI replied with an awkward smile.Kaelus said, kissing my fingers lightly.\u201cI\u2019ll go somewhere else for a second.\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead.\u201dThere were a lot of nobles who wanted to talk to him over their backs. I let him go without a hitch.Erinnis, who was watching us, said jokingly.\u201cThe marquis is so sweet to his girl.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dWell, Diana was the only object that Kaelus was affectionate to, but she wasn\u2019t Kaelus\u2019 woman.I don\u2019t agree with Erinnis very much, but I don\u2019t want to argue. Isn\u2019t it funny that the spouse tries hard to claim her husband\u2019s heartlessness?Eventually, foreign envoys from each country, the main characters of the event, arrived one after another.They were the first to greet Kaelus. Drinking the bottle, they\u00a0 congratulated him on returning to politics.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI feel proud for some reason.It seems that Kaelus has overcome all his mental illness. I am indescribably moved to watch him from the side all the time.The only person who is perfectly qualified to carry out diplomatic negotiations in the face of war threats with other countries, which anyone admits.An indispensable person in this empire.Standing among the nobles, my favorite is truly the pillar of a great empire.After a while, the loud voice of the servant rang out.\u201cEveryone, stand up and be polite!\u201dAttendees who were sitting in designated seats stood up on the spot in unison.The emperor, Helios, and Diana, who soon appeared.The nobles responded in unison to the majestic royal family.\u201cHonor to his majesty the great emperor of the empire.\u201d\u201cEveryone sit down.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s face was thinner than before. I couldn\u2019t take my eyes off him as I sat down.Kaelus and I were the highest aristocrats of the empire and sat at a table just below the upper seat where the royal family sat. Thanks to this, I was able to recognize every little expression and gesture of the emperor\u2019s family.\u201cToday\u2019s luncheon has been arranged to pray for close alliances and close friendship with each country that exchanges with our empire before God.\u201dThat\u2019s amazing. This is how you wrap up the imperial palace event in a temple-like atmosphere.The meal began with the priest\u2019s clear prayer.From the pre-dinner dish to the main dish, the plates were carried in one by one in order.\u201c\u2026\u201dAs expected, it is not unexpected.Diana\u2019s belief is that it is an important luncheon attended by the emperor.The number of ingredients in a plate did not exceed three. Even the spices commonly used in aristocratic families were rare at this table.A meal that really seems to have taken out all the \u2018privileges\u2019 that the privileged class can enjoy.This is the image of the empire pursued by the crown princess, the next empress.I glanced at the emperor.\u201c\u2026.\u201dAn elderly man holding a meal silently without any change of expression.Yeah, let\u2019s say this diet suits a patient like him a hundred times.Then what about other decent people and foreign guests who are specially invited here?This bizarre scene, as if to say that everything fancy and expensive is sin.It is truly pain, in itself, to forcefully follow an unconvincing belief.I turned to the emperor, and this time I looked around the nobles.Each of the ladies who had already experienced Diana\u2019s tea party had a false smile or a sneer on their face.Meanwhile, the male aristocrats, who faced Diana\u2019s \u201cbelief\u201d for the first time, seemed to be trying to calm their embarrassment.It\u2019s a real spectacle.I whispered to Kaelus.\u201cAs expected.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dHe accepted the situation with a very small nod.I can feel how wise it was to change the event to lunch. I would never have been able to decorate the dinner in this atmosphere.It is absurd to talk comfortably in a quiet atmosphere like a temple. No matter how noble the aristocrats are, if they are this quiet, they are even careful to breathe.I spoke softly to foreign ambassadors sitting at the same table.\u201cYou don\u2019t mind having a light breakfast, do you?\u201d\u201cHuh, of course.\u201dI\u2019m glad the distinguished guests understood. It seems that building friendship comfortably is only possible at the dinner of the marquis.In time, the meal ended calmly and quietly.The luncheon event was wrapped up with a prayer solemnly recited by the minister.It\u2019s time for the nobles to gather around the Lily Palace after the emperor leaves.\u201cKaelus, I\u2019ll go and prepare dinner.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see you later, Hestia.\u201dI glanced at Diana in the upper seat. Our eyes met momentarily, but she turned to another place first.It somehow bothers me to leave Kaelus alone.\u201cAre you sure you don\u2019t mind?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s no big deal if it\u2019s not okay.\u201dHe answered dryly.It was Kaelus who didn\u2019t say it was okay even if it was empty words. Should I rather be relieved because it\u2019s the same as usual?It bothers me one way or another, but I have to go back.~~~~I came home quickly in a small carriage.\u201cHow was your breakfast?\u201d asked the butler Uross, welcoming me.\u201cIt was as I expected. It was completely a temple chapel.\u201d\u201cOh, my\u2026.\u201dWe clicked our tongues but diligently checked the menu and checked the banquet hall.Tekima prepared a dress for me and waited.\u201cAs the marchioness had ordered, the hem of the skirt was opened.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s great. It would be more comfortable to move around.\u201dA few days ago, I asked him to fix my mermaid dress like a qipao. Tekima embodied my lame explanation perfectly. As expected, a competent designer.One wall of the dining room was connected to a large terrace. The terrace door was opened wide to create a garden as if it were a place.\u201cThe bartender will make cocktails on the terrace, madam.\u201dA bartender who was successfully recruited by Uross recognized me and politely honored me. I also finished the last inspection by simply responding.The sun sank slowly. When the sunset was shining, a stone lantern illuminating the garden was lit.\u201cAlright\u2026\u201dThe preparation is perfect.It was near the time for the guests to arrive.~~~~After a while, the sound of a cheerful carriage rang loudly everywhere.I stood among the two rows of servants, greeting Kaelus and the VIPs like a graceful lady.\u201cWelcome. Kaelus.\u201dFirst, I kissed my favorite\u2019s hand, and then I headed for the guests.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting, ladies and gentlemen.\u201dThe expression of ambassadors from other countries also brightened up, with the appearance of the marquis, which is quite different from the atmosphere of the royal palace\u2019s luncheon.\u201cThank you for your hospitality, marchioness.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s my first time to have a marquis\u2019 dinner, so I\u2019m looking forward to it. Hehe.\u201dI spoke as if I were a mistress.\u201cI hope what we\u2019ve prepared will live up to your expectations.\u201dKaelus whispered briefly in my ear.\u201cI\u2019ll change into something else.\u201d\u201cOkay, well, how was it at the palace?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it separately later.\u201dHe walked up the stairs with a brisk pace.\u201c\u2026\u201dThere must have been something.But now I don\u2019t have time to think.Helios decided to come to the marquis at the end of the meal. So I decided to eat first without waiting for him.I led the distinguished guests to the dinner. I didn\u2019t forget to decorate the hallway while walking.\u201cI feel like I\u2019m walking in the gallery.\u201dThe guests reacted. It\u2019s worth the careful attention.We finally arrived at the dinner room.The luxurious space, which combines the fresh scent of grass leaves in the garden and the string performance of the band, welcomed the party.\u201cOh\u2026.\u201dAll in all, the expressions seemed satisfactory.To be honest, it is thanks to the fact that the score was cut too much at the Imperial Palace. Even Countess Erinnis can do this.We sat around a round table. Kaelus changed in time and came down and sat down together.The bartender made cocktails and served each seat an aperitif \u2013 an appetizing drink before meals.Soon after, the hors d\u2019oeuvres \u2013 pre-dinner dish \u2013 was served. The menu is salad with seafood, smoked salmon, sturgeon eggs, and pickled fish.\u201cIt\u2019s simple, but we prepared it with all our heart.\u201dI said this, but first of all, the number of food overwhelmed the luncheon prepared by Diana. And of course, eye-pleasing plating and cocktails.The distinguished guests were all smiles and chatted together.\u201cYou are indeed the lord of Illion, who is known for his wealth, Marquis Kaelus.\u201d\u201cIt is a dish that is enjoyable for all five senses. Thank you.\u201dThe servants quickly carried the entree dish in time for hors d\u2019oeuvres to be almost finished. Each large plate was filled with boiled dishes, baked dishes, steamed dishes, and fried foods.The VIPs took as much food as they wanted. While the dishes were moving, conversations naturally went back and forth.\u201cExcuse me, can I have some salt there?\u201d\u201cOh, here it is. Even so, it seems that the people\u2019s livelihood is difficult because the salt market has risen recently.\u201d\u201cI know. I\u2019ve heard that the amount of sunlight was insufficient because it kept raining until recently in the salt mountains.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m glad the water isn\u2019t as bad as it was last year. Oh, there\u2019s almost no damage to Illion, right?\u201d\u201cYes, but we repaired the embankment this year. Prevention is the best way to prevent disasters.\u201d\u201cThe kingdom also suffered heavy damage last year, and the aftermath seems to be affecting it until this year. The recovery is a long way off, but even the people\u2019s livelihood was almost destroyed.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dThis is why the kingdom continues to provoke the empire. The ruler of the kingdom used the empire as a scapegoat to divert the angry public sentiment from the flood.As the status of the VIPs was their status, the conversation flowed into quite serious topics such as political situations and economic issues in each country. The initiative of the conversation was naturally given to Kaelus.I tried to be as reticent as I could to keep the conversation going. Instead, I did my part by listening.The entree is almost over, and it\u2019s already time for dessert.The butler Uross approached me.\u201cHis highness the crown prince will arrive soon.\u201d\u201cOh, then I\u2019ll go out.\u201dI stood up quietly without disturbing the meals of Kaelus and the VIPs.Helios got to the marquis in time.\u201cWelcome, your highness.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going through a lot. Marchioness, what is the atmosphere of the distinguished guests?\u201dBut I don\u2019t have to explain it, but the laughter over the hall told him everything.\u201c\u2026it seems to be no problem.\u201dHelios\u2019 expression was somehow bitter. Maybe it\u2019s because it\u2019s compared to the daytime luncheon.He walked leisurely down the hall and looked around.\u201cI think you have more decorations than before\u201d\u201cYes, I had to greet people who are precious, so I paid attention to this and that.\u201d\u201cOh, you did all this by yourself?\u201d\u201cNo way. I got a lot of help from the butler and the lady-in-waiting, and I also asked for advice from an acquaintance who is well versed in art.\u201dThe field that I am not good at should be helped by the person who is good. Doing everything on my own doesn\u2019t necessarily bring good results.Sometimes outward results are more important than inward intentions. This dinner is one of those.So Diana\u2019s choice is more painful. A belief that is consistently adhered to is valuable when you first respect the other person you face.\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios was also quiet as if he had a lot on his mind.While walking like that, I reached the grand banquet room where the dinner was held.Kaelus was the first to recognize Helios.\u201cYour highness the crown prince.\u201dThen the other VIPs rose in droves.\u201cTo the great little sun of the empire\u2026.\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s good etiquette. Let\u2019s all sit comfortably.\u201dHelios waved with a smile.Soon, the patissier\u2019s dexterous dessert was brought in. Cookies filled with plates piled up the tower, and chocolate fondue, which flowed down like a fountain, appeared. In addition, pudding, cake, and food that was unacceptable for Diana filled the grand banquet room one after another.I said with a bright smile.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you stand up and eat it to digest it?\u201d There are many refreshments next to the fondue that go well with chocolate.\u201dGuests began to roam freely and enjoy dessert.The high-dose liquor was also poured into each cup. The bartender filled the glass diligently among the distinguished guests with bottles.As if they had promised, none of them talked about the daytime meal. Even Helios.I suppressed my desire to laugh out loud as I watched the strangely united people.I need to show this to Diana. It\u2019s too bad.~~~~As the strong liquor began to get drunk, the guests were getting ready to go home.\u201cIt was a very pleasant meal, marquis.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I mean. I don\u2019t know how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve enjoyed it so comfortably.\u201dKaelus responded plainly.\u201cIt\u2019s all my wife\u2019s credit. I didn\u2019t help much.\u201dI can\u2019t believe you saved my face in front of the distinguished guests. My favorite was this sweet?The maidservant loaded each carriage with a packed dessert present before the guests returned. Foreign envoys were also moved by the hospitality that did not miss the grace until the end.Helios unexpectedly stayed with us and sent the guests first.\u201cSee you at the palace soon.\u201d\u201cYes, I will always wait for your call.\u201dSeeing that Helios stayed without going back with the guests, there must be something else he wants to talk about.Kaelus also noticed this and recommended it to Helios.\u201cIf you don\u2019t mind, would you like to go to the backyard?\u201d\u201cShall we? The weather is nice, so it\u2019s not bad to take a night walk after a long time.\u201dI frowned secretly. We\u2019re not that close to each other. Like taking a walk.With the butlers and servants organizing the banquet hall, each of us eventually headed to the backyard with a glass.~~~~\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus and I quietly waited for Helios to speak. Helios was organizing what to say, and he just walked silently.After some time.\u201c\u2026I managed to save face thanks to you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your grace.\u201dKaelus immediately handed it over.So far, there is no sign of anything other than basic courtesy between the two military leaders.I\u2019m a little distant from the two, of course. I have a slight nervousness.Then.\u201cKael, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dWords of apology that come out of nowhere.\u201cWhat are you talking about? Your highness has no reason to feel sorry for me\u201dKaelus responded plainly, too. Nevertheless, Helios shook his head.\u201cHestia is right to point it out to me. I\u2019m always putting the burden on you.\u201d\u201cYour highness, it\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cHey, Kael. At least for now.\u201dA slightly angry voice.\u201cCan you not say that, your highness?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus shut his mouth tight.I was dumbfounded behind him. Do you think he shouldn\u2019t have done this? Don\u2019t you know the meaning of a breakup?Helios sighed loudly and shook his shoulder.\u201cYeah. I\u2019m sorry about this, too. I\u2019m taking it out on you again.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026\u201dHe took a beat, then slowly opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026\u2026It\u2019s too late to be of any use, but I apologize. Kael, I didn\u2019t know how precious you were to me and I treated you recklessly.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWhile Kaelus was silent, I looked at Helios with stunned eyes.What the hell is he up to? I don\u2019t know what he wants to say now. Do you want to ease the guilt you have left?Did Diana, who even won by killing her friend, belatedly realize that she was actually an empty gangjeong* and wanted to return it to Kaelus?*TN: a dessert that is empty inside so Hestia is calling Diana a hollow personNevertheless, his voice was very calm.\u201cI will never make such a mistake again. I won\u2019t turn away from you just because I\u2019m looking at my life.\u201dI couldn\u2019t help but cut in.\u201cSorry, your grace. Isn\u2019t that something that only your friend would say?\u201d\u201cHess.\u201dIt was unexpectedly Kaelus who responded to my words.He turned around and added, holding my hand lightly.\u201cI\u2019m fine. I\u2019ll hear the prince\u2019s words out for now.\u201d\u201c\u2026okay.\u201dI\u2019d just like to turn around and walk away, but if I did, I don\u2019t know what that unrestrained man would really say.I have no choice but to hold it in.Helios\u2019 lips slowly opened.\u201cThank you, Kael. Hestia, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dI deliberately turned away from his gaze. Because I had to do something to show my discomfort.Kaelus said in a dry voice.\u201cI think you\u2019re a little drunk.\u201d\u201cHaha, does it look like that?\u201dHelios shook his glass with an awkward smile.\u201cBut this isn\u2019t too strong. I drink brandy every day.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a bad habit, your highness.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t help it. I can\u2019t sleep unless I drink.\u201dThat\u2019s a pity. What should I do?\u201cKael.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d\u201cI really, really swear. I won\u2019t bother you again. I won\u2019t covet what\u2019s yours, I won\u2019t break your peace.\u201d\u201c\u2026You\u2019re already doing that.\u201dBut I clenched my teeth silently.It\u2019s not just about Kael. That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying about me.I confess that I was shaken for a while as my relationship with Diana deteriorated.At the same time, he made his own pledge. He declared to himself that he will never touch Kaelus\u2019 again.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy legs stiffened by itself. I was lagging behind in my footsteps.I wish someone would shut that guy\u2019s mouth.I feel like I\u2019m going to scream.\u201cHess\u2026?\u201dKaelus turned around and looked at me.Brilliant silver hair under the moonlight. Purple eyes worrying about me.I took a look at Kaelus and looked at Helios.The closed lips, the shade hanging over the beautiful face, and the lonely sinking gold.Don\u2019t get caught. Don\u2019t show it. Don\u2019t spill it.Don\u2019t show your trashy feelings to Kaelus.The closed red lips slowly fell off.\u201cHestia, don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI will be careful not to cross the line drawn by you and Kael. Friend or not, Kael is as precious as ever to me.\u201dA remarkably ambivalent expression.How is it possible to say the words of different meanings to me and Kaelus in one sentence so exquisitely?\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Hestia. I will never betray Kaelus again.\u201dThe golden eyes of Helios turned straight to me.\u201c\u2026.\u201dI didn\u2019t answer back. Instead, I glared at him as hard as I could.I\u2019ll kill you for real.If that male lead betrays my favorite again, if he breaks that oath he utters.Then I\u2019ll set fire in front of you and drag you into the fire.\u201cHestia.\u201dKaelus carefully grabbed the cold-hardening hand.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt melts little by little in that warmth.Only then did I catch his burning gaze.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI let out a long sigh.The tension and anger that was strangling me finally dissipated.I clasped my favorite\u2019s hand. Then I opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026the baron\u2019s merchant ship is about to depart.\u201d\u201cYes, I know.\u201dI asked in a slightly sarcastic tone to Helios\u2019 calm voice.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you banned the crown princess from investing? So how did the merchant ship get out so fast?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe Diana made the worst choice.\u201dHelios\u2019 answer sounded like he\u2019d rather believe it.Kaelus looked back at Helios.\u201cBut you have to keep the worst in mind.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dHelios bowed slightly at his words.\u201cI promised the emperor. I won\u2019t abandon Diana.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cYour highness!\u201dI can\u2019t believe the word \u201cabandon\u201d came out of his mouth.It is an expression that can only be said because we are alone, but it was so blatant and direct that I stopped shouting.Nevertheless, Helios himself was just calm.\u201cHa\u2026 yes. The marquis is right. Anyway, we have to come up with measures in advance.\u201dBut there was no specific word on what to do. After all, Helios also means that there is no countermeasure right now.He grinned at us standing in a daze.\u201cIt\u2019s late at night. I\u2019ll be on my way.\u201dHe patted Kaelus on the shoulder and strode out of the patronage.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dWe looked silently at the back of Helios.Somehow he seems to have become very small.~~~~\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dWhen I was ready to go to bed, I got a fiery drink.I don\u2019t usually get drunk with a few drinks like this. However, maybe because I was nervous all along, I got tired late and my body was drooping.Just when I thought I should go to bed soon.\u201cMadam, are you sleeping?\u201dThe voice of the butler Uross came from outside. I had just quit going into bed and opened the door quickly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cAh, Lord Kaelus asked me to call you to his room if you were still awake.\u201d\u201cReally? Okay. I\u2019ll be there now.\u201dI was dizzy from the drunkenness, but I tried to walk straight down the hall.\u201cKaelus\u2026?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026. You haven\u2019t fallen asleep yet.\u201dKaelus was about to go to bed, and sat on the bed covered with a blanket.\u201cYou must be tired, but you didn\u2019t go to sleep right away..\u201d\u201c\u2026I have a favor to ask of you.\u201dSomehow hesitating feels somewhat familiar.I laughed softly.\u201cDo you want me to hold your hand again until you fall asleep?\u201d\u201c\u2026can\u2019t you\u2026?\u201dHow can it not be possible?It\u2019s just a little dangerous. Because I\u2019m about to fall asleep before him now.But without revealing any of that inside, I sat on the edge of the bed.\u201cHa ha, give me your hand.\u201d\u201cThank you, Hess.\u201dKaelus dithered into the blanket. With his hands in my hands.\u201cGood night. Kaelus.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dGradually, my favorite closed his eyes.Fifty thousand emotions fluctuated today, but looking at him with his eyes closed like this just calms me down.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnyway, right now.\u201c\u2026\u201dI hope he falls asleep soon.~~~~\u201c\u2026\u201dI opened my eyes.But a strange sense of incompatibility was felt instinctively.\u201c\u2026?\u201dI don\u2019t know the identity of this feeling because I\u2019m not awake yet.I blinked slowly.I think the wallpaper is a little different. Come to think of it, the location of the desk is a little weird.That sofa is the same as my favorite\u2019s bedroom.Hmm\u2026 Favorite\u2026 Is it the same?\u201c\u2026?!\u201dA flash of shock struck me. Huck, I jumped up without realizing it.And then a pretty silver thread caught on my finger\u2026 no\u2025!\u201cYes\u2026.\u201dA groan to make matters worse.\u201c!\u201dAhhh! I\u2019d rather have a nightmare!No, no! I need to run before my favorite wakes up!An instinct that is faster than reason. Before I knew it, I stretched my feet out of bed.All I have to do is not shake the bed and just walk away! Please, may this bed be still, not loud!\u201c\u2026Hess\u2026? Where\u2026?\u201d\u201c!\u201dI\u2019m doomed.Purple jewels glances through the narrow eyelids of Kaelus lying down.\u201cHess\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry, sorry. Oh!\u201dWith my feet sticking out of bed and stiffening, I hurriedly apologized first.Wow. My face must be red right now. I don\u2019t even need to look in the mirror.It\u2019s crazy.I slept with my favorite.Oh, this is why you shouldn\u2019t come to men\u2019s room after drinking.I must have hit him first, trembling all over the place.\u201cI just held your hand, Hestia.\u201d\u201cSorry, sorry\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, I wonder why this is something to be sorry about, but I think I should apologize first.\u201cBut it\u2019s much warmer with the two of us in one blanket.\u201d\u201cOh, sorry, sorry!\u201d\u201cWhy do you keep apologizing?\u201d\u201cJust, uh\u2026 I\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA dark history that I\u2019ll never forget in my life.I created it this morning.~~~~Eventually, Kaelus, who was completely awake, even served tea.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt should have disappeared like air. Why am I so slow and humiliated?\u201cWhat are you thinking?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI\u2019m crying. Kaelus, I\u2019m going crazy.Kaelus laughed in a daze.\u201cHa\u2026 you woke up in the same bed with me\u2026\u201d\u201cGasp!\u201dThe tea trickled down my nose.I managed to come to my senses after a long time of scrambling.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201d\u201cIs it okay now?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dKaelus shook his head. That smile on your face must have been caused by the absurdity. It\u2019s for sure.\u201cI have something to talk about, so take your time. You don\u2019t have to go out this morning, do you?\u201dWhy would I go out so early in the morning?I nodded with tears in my eyes.\u201cI\u2019ll go slowly\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dBy the way, I keep looking at the long silver hair that flows gently. Hair can\u2019t move, really.He put the tea cup down on the table, and Kaelus spoke.\u201cWhen you left first after lunch yesterday\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, while I left the palace first yesterday to prepare dinner, I thought something had happened to Kaelus.I\u2019ve been losing my mind since the morning, so I forgot for a moment.\u201cWhat did the crown princess say?\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a little confusing.\u201dKaelus tilted his head.~~~~Shortly after I returned to the marquis.As Kaelus was cooling his head alone in the garden of the Lily Palace, he heard a small movement.It was Diana who appeared in front of her favorite when she looked back. Just in time for him to be alone, as I expected in the carriage.[Kael? Why are you alone?][My wife went home first. We have a lot of things to prepare.][I see\u2026]She was the one who asked after him out of the blue before. Why has her attitude changed so much recently after acting as if she would never forgive him?In fact, the reason was obvious. Because it\u2019s cold with Helios.However, isn\u2019t the relationship between husband and wife supposed to become stronger by moving between cold and hot?Kaelus knew well that even if she approached him gently now, it wasn\u2019t because she fundamentally changed her opinion of him.**TN: Kaelus\u2019 point of view from hereJust a temporary favor, nothing more or less.The longer they faced each other, the more painful the old feelings will be.Kaelus made a brief bow and tried to get out of course.But Diana eventually held him back.[Don\u2019t you have anything to say to me?]Has it come?I guess she was going to argue about changing the dinner she prepared to lunch.Thinking this, Kaelus bowed politely.[I\u2019m sorry, your highness. It was the prince\u2019s will to have a separate dinner][\u2026.]Diana was silent.But whether she accepted it or not, Kaelus was less inclined to argue.I\u2019m just going to leave.[Kael. Do you think I\u2019m doing something wrong, too?]She twisted her face as if she were about to cry,What do you mean something wrong?How can everyone be blamed for doing their best on their own path?Kaelus recalled the past of giving the Duchess Orcus a poison tea.Do I regret it? No, I don\u2019t regret it.No matter how many times I thought about it, the conclusion was the same. Even if I go back in time and go back to that time, I would make the same choice.So I answered.[No, I don\u2019t think so][Kael\u2026][We cannot dare to judge right or wrong by what we have done as we believe. Like I did, so did your highness.]He turned his back at the end of the word.\u201cAsking you if she\u2019s doing something wrong.. It\u2019s definitely a surprise.\u201d**TN: back to Hestia\u2019s point of viewI spoke my mind frankly.Kaelus also nodded.\u201cThe Crown Princess is a very upright person. It was an unimaginable question for her.\u201d\u201cThe situation around the saintess is not good these days. His majesty has been ill, she has been at odds with the crown prince, and she has become estranged from the nobles.\u201dI\u2019m speaking calmly, but I\u2019m actually dying to laugh.Come on, Diana. It\u2019s really your first time with the \u2018world\u2019, right?Since she was born as Diana, she\u2019s been walking on flower and cider roads all the time, so this situation must be very unfamiliar.But look carefully. This is the world that people who are not the main characters have lived in.It\u2019s a reality that\u2019s hard and refreshing, and cider is even more of an illusion.\u201cI\u2019m sorry if she were asking me for advice.\u201dKaelus looked down quietly.But I don\u2019t think so.\u201cHuh. No way. If she really wanted to ask for advice, she wouldn\u2019t sneak in and ask when you\u2019re alone in the garden, but she would have prepared a proper place to listen.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was just because she wanted you to say what she wanted to hear.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026.\u201dSomehow it looked weak. He must have been distraught at the thought of depressed Diana.Do you want me to cheer you up?\u201cWhat you said to the saintess may have been something she really wanted to hear. You did what she wanted.\u201d\u201c?\u201dThe purple eyes that look wonderfully are very beautiful.There was a spontaneous smile.\u201cI told her she wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201d\u201cThe crown princess would have needed certainty. Not thinking for herself, but being acknowledged by others.\u201dHelios, who has grown apart, will no longer be able to act as Diana\u2019s \u2018answer\u2019Why did you kick Kaelus, Diana?\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus hasn\u2019t spoken for a while.And then finally.\u201c\u2026You\u2019re right.\u201dHe accepted with his usual expressionless face.Anyway, I\u2019m done drinking tea now, I wanted to get out of this pajamas quickly.\u201cThen I\u2019ll go back to my room.\u201d\u201cWon\u2019t you have breakfast?\u201dWhat context is this? I answered, rolling my eyes diligently.\u201cI have to eat it, right?\u201d\u201cBut why would you go back to your room?\u201d\u201cWhat? No, do you go down to the dining hall like this?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus, with a somewhat frustrated look, spoke step by step as if he were a patient teacher.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to eat breakfast at the dining hall. We\u2019re drinking tea here now, and we can ask them to bring their meals here.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dI know what Kaelus wants to say.But what\u2019s urgent for me right now is not breakfast. I wanted to do something about this thin outfit.\u201cBut I\u2019m going to change and come back\u2026\u201d\u201cSigh\u2026 Yes, I see.\u201dEventually, I was so grateful that my favorite, who seemed to raise his hands, accepted my stubbornness, that I bent down.\u201cThank you, Kaelus!\u201d\u201c\u2026See you at the restaurant.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d~~~~Since I drank at dinner the day before, breakfast was prepared with hot consomme for the hangover.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dA spontaneous exclamation came out. Koreans should drink hot soup.\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus looked at me quietly, and soon focused on the meal again.I smiled silently.It\u2019s calm but peaceful. Perhaps thanks to the hot soup, it seems that the whole body as well as the heart are warm.How many days has there been such moments since I became possessed by a novel?What\u2019s more, it\u2019s the morning I woke up with my favorite.Maybe it\u2019s a lifetime of embarrassing history and luck to remember forever.\u201cWell, Lady Hestia. Maybe last night\u2026.\u201d\u201cCough! Cough\u2026!\u201d\u201cMadam! Are you okay?\u201dI choked heavily. Of all things, Uross brought up nonsense!\u201c\u2026cold water.\u201dSomehow I could hear the sickening voice of Kaelus.\u201cThank you\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s not so peaceful.I\u2019m really desperate for a hiding place.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the royal luncheon event of the foreign envoys, which made headlines in many ways, was over.I was invited to tea time by Countess Erinnis and headed to her mansion.\u201cHuh. What are we going to talk about this time?\u201dThe tea time that the Countess holds with her friends is simply all kinds of gossip. A gathering full of important information, but also useless information.Listen to what you hear in moderation and ignore the rest.Presumably, today\u2019s pumpkin seed theme will certainly be Diana\u2019s luncheon. Maybe not just Erinnis, but wherever socialites gather, they\u2019ll talk about the simple, pious lunch.There\u2019s a lot to talk about. From the simple menu to the emperor\u2019s appearance.In addition, the sight of the Lily Palace, which showed that the temple has penetrated deeply into the palace, must have brought a sense of crisis to the aristocratic society.I giggled and leaned my back against the carriage wall.\u201cWell, it\u2019s going to be fun today.\u201dChatting is always fun.~~~~\u201cWelcome, marchioness!\u201dErinnis welcomed me with a big smile. Other ladies greeted each other with smiles.\u201cWhoa, I\u2019m not too late, am I?\u201d\u201cYes. I\u2019m just about to start.\u201dA parlor of five or six people. Luxury teas and snacks soon spread out on the table.It\u2019s official chat time.\u201cAs expected of the saintess. It was a very generous meal.\u201d\u201cActually, it\u2019s not easy to be that stubborn. I\u2019m sure she must be able to read the people around her.\u201d\u201cWould Madame Merope have left the imperial palace if she had noticed?* Whew, I wish I could hear from her about what she\u2019s doing..\u201d*TN: would she have left if Diana noticed that people didn\u2019t like her methods and wasn\u2019t stubbornPerhaps because they were noble women who had long interacted with Madame Merope, who was a court lady, they expressed their nostalgia for her.Then let\u2019s touch the sensitive area.\u201cIt\u2019s not just Madame Merope, is it? Few of the servants and maids left in the Lily Palace worked with Madame Merope.\u201dThe reaction was explosive.\u201cI mean, that\u2019s a shame.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it just a pity? To be honest, I\u2019m angry. I can see how much the saintess ignores and despises the aristocracy.\u201dErinnis smiled, too.\u201cInstead, she filled the vacancy with shrines. If it\u2019s the saintess\u2019 word, people will be loyal without asking twice.\u201dAs she said, the people from the new shrine would undoubtedly believe that Diana would treat them with red beans*.*TN: saying you\u2019ll believe someone\u2019s claim that a fermented soybean lump can be made from red beans. I.e. that you\u2019ll believe anythingHow can you surround yourself with people who only say things that are good to hear?Of course, it is true that any human being does not want to hear bitter things. But it\u2019s not all wrong just because you don\u2019t want to hear it.In particular, if there is a field that you do not know well, even if the expert is an ugly human being, they should be kept by your side.From Diana\u2019s point of view, Madame Merope was such a figure.\u201cWe have to stop the priests from being active in the palace more. At this rate, the minister is about to enter the palace.\u201dI spoke in a heavy tone.Erinnis added in a timely manner.\u201cThe temple has forgotten its duty and is constantly greedy for the imperial palace. It\u2019s because the saintess paved the way well.\u201dThe ladies soon had a good look on their faces.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to see the face of the minister in the temple. Where and what is he doing?\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure he\u2019s playing in the Lily Palace, pretending to be an aristocrat.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that ridiculous? The saint who calls for thrift and frugality must have no intention of saving time.\u201dPublic opinion is gathering that people from the new shrine should be thrown out of the palace. It seemed like I could appeal directly to the emperor at a cabinet meeting if I had a proper excuse.Erinnis glanced at me with a meaningful look.In fact, the \u2018excuse\u2019 is already in hand.Helios ordered Diana not to invest in Baron Potos\u2019 merchant ships with imperial finances. However, Diana got money from somewhere else and invested.Where did the funds come from? It must have come from the temple.The signal sent by Erinnis means that we can use this as an excuse to pressure Diana.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut I shook my head slightly.It\u2019s still early. At least when the merchant ship departs and floats on the water, the bomb is worth it.It is difficult for Diana\u2019s funds to be recovered by publicizing this matter before the ship leaves. A situation must be created in which she cannot retrieve it even if she wants to.In short, it means that there must be no way to recover the money before it can be given a decisive blow.Therefore, I suggested another way to persuade people more emotionally.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you find people in poor homes who haven\u2019t been treated properly?\u201dI exchanged my gaze with Erinnis and went on again.\u201cIt\u2019s been quite a while since the rain stopped, and I think the reason the epidemic hasn\u2019t completely subsided is because they\u2019re neglecting poor patients in the temple.\u201d\u201cWell, in the past, the epidemic would have gone away. Isn\u2019t it because the priests aren\u2019t where they belong?\u201dHer appropriate support.This is why it is so nice to have a political ally.I continued with a nod.\u201cIt\u2019s enough for everyone here to find examples one by one. The temple will lose its cause if we do well.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not hard!\u201dThe people sitting around were soon persuaded by our words.I bent my lips at an angle.\u201cWhen I\u2019m ready, I\u2019ll go to the cabinet meeting myself. I will accuse the temple in front of the best nobles of the empire.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Hestia is so determined!\u201dErinnis smiled, too.\u201cIt would be even better if we had a banquet for noble families. I\u2019ll step up and do it.\u201d\u201cThank you, Countess Erinnis.\u201dThe ladies sitting here are the mistresses who lead their family. It is different from the power of aristocratic young ladies who have no choice but to obey their parents.When they start moving all at once, the social center of gravity will naturally shift.No one will dare to oppose our cause.It was time for the dissatisfaction of the nobles who had endured so far to explode like a bomb.~~~~After deciding to make a public debate, I devoted myself to organizing the accumulated data step by step.First of all, the marquis\u2019 employees investigated the risk of transmission.\u201cThe incidence of disease relative to the population is certainly lower than that of the capital\u2026\u201cProbably thanks to sewage maintenance and the supply of soap.Using my ability to make presentation materials in the past, I expressed information with intuitive figures and tables.In the past, when Kaelus wrote a report, I helped him once in this way, and I remembered that he liked it very much.\u201cHehe\u2026\u201dA spontaneous laugh. When I think of his expression of admiration at the time, I am pleased again.Now that the disease has occurred, it\u2019s time to calculate the cure rate. I meticulously recorded the number of people coming to the temple to be treated and the number of people actually getting sick in the slums. And I counted the number of people who couldn\u2019t go to the temple even though they were sick.In fact, statistics seem to be very objective data, but in reality, they could be interpreted in various ways depending on the purpose of use. That\u2019s why there is a common saying, \u2018Playing with statistics.\u2019So, I decided to play a little bit of a prank, too.\u201cIf you make the denominator smaller, the number becomes larger.\u201dOnly the number of visitors to the temple of imperial city and Illion were selected. Using this number as a denominator, the number of disease occurrences in both regions was raised to the numerator. As a result, there was a much larger ratio difference than the disease incidence rate calculated using the total population as a denominator.In terms of this ratio alone, the situation in the capital seemed almost three times worse than in Illion.The difference in numbers that anyone can see is heartbreaking. No one would dare say, \u2018Ah, that\u2019s it!\u2019And if I add one more thing, I add to the icing on the cake, that is, the number of people who haven\u2019t been treated in the temple.Of course, the number of people was higher in the capital, and therefore, the number of patients who could not visit the temple was much higher in the capital. In addition, Illion has already improved its hygiene significantly.\u201cIf this is the case\u2026 Game over.\u201dIt\u2019s important to get a head start in every fight.If I capture the eyes and ears of the audience with this \u201cannouncement material\u201d at the cabinet meeting, even the emperor and Helios who want to cover for Diana will not be able to speak up on the spot.The primary goal is to make the world aware of the laziness and greed of the temple.Then, once this goal is achieved, it will expose Diana\u2019s incompetence and lack of qualifications to the world with Baron Potos\u2019 merchant ship sinking.To be honest, the crown princess is not a role to go back and forth with the support of the people. It\u2019s not like she was elected in an election.Even if the whole country beats Diana, it doesn\u2019t mean she will step down immediately from being crown princess.However, covering up for the criticized crown princess is a huge political burden in itself.If the nobles who seek cooperation turn their backs, and the people who are supposed to support them rather criticize them.\u201cHelios, if you don\u2019t abandon Diana, the next emperor will be in danger.\u201dRofan male lead Helios. He was originally a hard-headed power character.May the character recover again.The role of Helios, a lover, ended with the ending of the novel.~~~~I decided not to go to the palace for a while.Not only did I not have any prophecy to tell, but it was burdensome to talk to Helios alone as an aide. In addition, I had to be meticulous in preparing to appear at a cabinet meeting.But would everything go my way just because I made up my mind like that?\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dIn the envelope, it was written in very neat handwriting, Marchioness Hestia should meet Helios, the crown prince.A sigh broke out on its own.I don\u2019t want to go, but I don\u2019t have an excuse to refuse.I picked up the envelope and went to the study where Kaelus was.I peeped into the open door.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy favorite was working with glasses on. It\u2019s so wonderful that I can\u2019t get enough of it.I have to go in and talk to him now.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dI\u2019m sorry to interrupt you because you seem to have been concentrating for a while.When I was hesitating outside the door like that door.\u201c\u2026?\u201dHe looked up.\u201cHestia?\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dOops. I finally got noticed.\u201cWhat are you doing there?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll disturb you.\u201dI shuffled my way inside. Since I was caught anyway, it would rather take less of Kaelus\u2019 time to deliver my business quickly and disappear.Kaelus raised his eyebrows with a straight face.\u201cWhen you come to see me, it\u2019s always a case of business.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201dHe wouldn\u2019t believe it if I said it was because it was so pretty when my favorite was concentrating. Kaelus will never know how much I\u2019m making silly comments inside.I put the envelope from the palace on the table.\u201cThe crown prince paged me.\u201dKaelus looked at me with a slight frown. As if he was asking, \u2018So what?\u2019\u201cI don\u2019t know why he called me because I don\u2019t have anything to say to him.\u201d\u201cEven without that, he seems to have something to say. Is there a specific reason for a boss to call his aide?\u201dThat\u2019s true.Maybe I just want to be childish or whine to my favorite.\u201cIt\u2019s annoying that he told me to come even though I don\u2019t want to.\u201d That\u2019s what I really want to say.Don\u2019t be such a child.My favorite\u2019s answer reminds me again.\u201cThat\u2019s true, too. I felt burdened for no reason.\u201dI smiled awkwardly and got up again.Then.\u201c\u2026Hess.\u201d\u201c?\u201dIn rare cases, Kaelus called me and hesitated.\u201cIt\u2019s, I think I made a mistake.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHe dropped his shoulders slightly.\u201cThis isn\u2019t what you want, and you can\u2019t talk to me without business\u2026\u201dMy favorite came out with that, so I don\u2019t know what to do with myself.\u201cNot at all! I\u2019m just here to let you know as I\u2019ve been doing. I always told you first when I went to see the crown prince.\u201d\u201cBut this isn\u2019t it.\u201dThe air made me more embarrassed when Kaelus was depressed.\u201cThis isn\u2019t what I intended either.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHe kept frowning awkwardly.I was forced to laugh quietly.\u201cKael, you don\u2019t have to consciously try to be kind to me. It\u2019s enough if you just treat me like you normally do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t force yourself to change it. I loved it when you signed the marriage contract without reading it.\u201dHow can I prove that I mean it now? There is nothing I can do but smile brightly.\u201c\u2026\u201dHe closed his lips and looked at me. For some reason, the gaze is so itchy.**TN: it makes her uncomfortable\u201cWell, then\u2026 I\u2019ll be back after the palace\u2026\u201dI quickly turned around and hid my burning face.~~~~I arrived in front of the Lion Palace with as much composure as possible. It was where Helios\u2019 office moved.I walked straight into the room when I arrived under the guidance of the attendant.\u201cIt\u2019s Hestia. I\u2019ve been called by you.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re here?\u201dHelios calmly put down his pen and raised his face.\u201cLet\u2019s take a seat.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dIt looked somewhat different from usual.I\u2019m always nervous in front of Helioz, but I should never let my guard down again this time.The servant brought the tray. A savory aroma of coffee filled the office.\u201c\u2026\u201dCoffee again.When Helios served coffee before, the purpose was to get ideas for the dinner event.What kind of bribe does this coffee want now?\u201c\u2026\u201dI took a careful sip. Not only the scent was good, but the taste was excellent.I put down the glass without making a noise.\u201cYou must want something from me.\u201dLet\u2019s cut to the chase and get down to business. This is how Helios and I talk.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dAs expected, he also put down his glass with an unexpected smile.Come to think of it, why did he drink coffee just like me today? It\u2019s even more suspicious.\u201cYou never came back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not an obligatory politician. Look for someone else if you want someone to poke around.\u201dI said it out loud on purpose.I have no intention of wasting time talking to Helios for a long time. I can\u2019t afford to waste my time facing this guy.Then he pulled up one end of his lip.\u201cOh, my. But I think we should have a political conversation today.\u201d\u201c?\u201dIt\u2019s a political conversation. What is there for him and I to talk politically?Oh, there\u2019s one. A matter of great importance.\u201cIs it related to the Crown Princess?\u201d\u201cHaha, as expected of the marquis\u2019 wife.\u201dHis smile feels empty. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re laughing even if you laugh.I straightened my back and straightened my posture. Don\u2019t you think you should show an attitude appropriate to serious and heavy talk?Helios slowly recovered his laughter.\u201cI was told that you and your friends were working on a plan.\u201d\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s for?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dHe nodded heavily.I laughed ridiculously.\u201cThen you don\u2019t have to negotiate with me, do you? I\u2019m moving with a single mind that I don\u2019t want to see the temple act as the master of this empire instead of the imperial family, your highness the crown prince.\u201d\u201cOn the surface, I suppose. But isn\u2019t there another reason for you?\u201dHe added bitterly.\u201cNot a grand cause for the empire, but a more personal purpose.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI stared at the golden eyes in front of me. I opened my mouth, expressionless.\u201cThen you know better. The fact that political negotiations won\u2019t work for me.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, maybe.\u201dHelios\u2019 expression clouded.\u201cYou hate me and Diana very much. Because you think we abandoned Kaelus.\u201dI think that\u2019s true. Now you want to deny it?I waited for Helios\u2019 words without replying.\u201cAt first, I misunderstood your purpose.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI thought that you were trying to take advantage of your time as a marchioness and then enjoy your private life. But now I understand.\u201dHe had a lonely smile.\u201cYou truly loved Kaelus.\u201dI responded coldly.\u201cI have never deceived or concealed such sincerity, Your Highness Helios.\u201d\u201cYes, it was consistent. That\u2019s why I\u2019m saying I misunderstood.\u201dNamjoo admitted without a hitch.\u201cIn fact, what I\u2019m going to talk about now is not a political opinion, but rather a personal plea. Hestia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe real reason you want to attack the temple is to drive Diana to the edge of the cliff. Because she hurt Kaelus badly.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t deny it.\u201dI gave a stiff answer.Are you going to beg me to save Diana? I wouldn\u2019t budge at all.Either way, it\u2019s going to be a waste of course, Helios.\u201cI want to protect Diana,\u00a0 Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes, go ahead. Your Highness, I won\u2019t stop you.\u201dIt\u2019s good for me if you two hug each other and sink together.Helios smiled bitterly.\u201cI will hand over the Attica estate that you want right away.\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe Attica estate.Land owned by the dead Duke Orcus and Princess Letona.A vast area bordering the northern border.But the transfer of this land has already been promised in a memorandum written by Helios when he appointed me as his aide.\u201cYour highness the crown prince, wasn\u2019t that land obtained in exchange for my prophecy? Regardless of this, it\u2019ll be mine anyway. You promised to stamp your seal, right?\u201dI couldn\u2019t believe it, so I even laughed vainly.Helios nodded darkly.\u201cI know. I\u2019d like you to think of it as moving that time a little earlier.\u201d\u201cFor me, the timing isn\u2019t even a big deal I\u2019m sorry, but I can\u2019t accept your deal.\u201d\u201cKaelus\u2019 promotion to the duchy at the same time.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI really don\u2019t know how to react.I can\u2019t believe it. I can\u2019t believe it. Anger.At the same time, when I heard that Helios would immediately fulfill his promise to be promoted to duke, I was happy as if I had made my long-cherished wish into reality.But I have to say everything I have to say.\u201cYour highness, when you wrote the memorandum, you certainly said that it would be difficult for you to ascend the throne without a just cause And he also said it\u2019s not something you can decide alone.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cBut is there a different situation now than then?\u201dHelios answered calmly.\u201cI\u2019ll make him a duke before he goes to negotiate with the kingdom.\u201d\u201c!\u201dTo prevent the kingdom from threatening to start a war, Kaelus was studying diplomatic strategies from that day until now as soon as he heard my prophecy.Therefore, the negotiations of Kaelus were bound to succeed.But Helios means that before confirming the success of the negotiations, he will first make Kaelus a duke.\u201cYou\u2019re going to make him the duke before the negotiations? Then what would you do with your cause?\u201d\u201cHis majesty\u2019s willing to give full power to the highest aristocrat representing the Empire.\u201dHelios said in a serious tone.\u201cIt\u2019s getting closer to your prophecy. The promotion of the title won\u2019t take long.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you. I made a memorandum in front of you. However, there was a possibility that the implementation would continue indefinitely because we couldn\u2019t find a proper cause.\u201dI burst out laughing in vain.\u201cAre you confessing that there is a loophole in the memorandum?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ll admit it.\u201dMy stomach was burning with rage.That fox had made a way out! I stupidly didn\u2019t realize that either.Nevertheless, Helios looked serious all the time without a smile.\u201cI mean, I won\u2019t take advantage of that loophole. When sitting at the negotiating table with the kingdom, Kaelus would be a duke, not a marquis. You will also be the lady of Attica.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt is funny to see myself in the past when I was delighted with the perforated memorandum.Along with that, I am relieved that there was an opportunity to revive the memorandum that almost became a piece of tissue.What should I do?Accept this deal and I have to stop attacking Diana.If I don\u2019t like it, I can reject this deal.Or, like Helios did, creating a loophole that he wouldn\u2019t notice.\u201c\u2026.\u201dGolden eyes stared at me.I\u2019ll have to clarify what he wants first.\u201cYour highness the crown prince, then, should I stop making a plan?\u201d\u201cTo be exact, I want you to stop accusing the temple, Hestia.\u201dI laughed out loud.\u201cYour highness, the shame of the temple cannot be hidden forever just because one person stops. Someone\u2019s gonna take over what I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have to think about it again then. But I\u2019m trying to convince you right now.\u201d\u201cThe temple forces control over the palace. As I have said before, you know that the authority of this palace has been reversed not by his majesty but by his majesty\u2019s mercy?\u201d\u201cEven so.\u201dHelios\u2019 face was once again shaded.\u201cI can\u2019t give up on Diana.\u201dI twisted my lips up.\u201cAnd even if it ends up being destroyed?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll do my best not to reach the worst outcome.\u201dHe cast his eyes slightly downward.I looked at him carefully and opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026\u2026I thought you were a hard-headed ruler.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dA lonely smile.I laughed sarcastically.\u201cWhat a great love. The wise prince is so bound.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s amazing that you\u2019re trying to go back the long way, leaving the simple way to overcome this difficulty. I envy you, Your Highness. I\u2019ll never see you like this again in your life.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios still said nothing.As if atone for something that shook him for a moment.Like desperately trying to keep his vow never to covet \u2018Kaelus\u2019.\u2019That stubborn male character who won\u2019t let go of Diana\u2019s hand even if she would die soon.Why do you have to push him away when he tries so hard?I let out a short sigh.\u201cPhew. Alright, your highness the crown prince.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHe raised his head and stared straight into my eyes.\u201cI accept your deal. Before negotiating with the kingdom, you give Kaelus the duke title and you give me the Attica estate.\u201d\u201cI promise.\u201d\u201cThen I will also stop going to the cabinet meeting in person and accusing the temple. I will no longer accept the lives of the nobles.\u201d\u201cThank you, Hestia.\u201dAt last Helios smiled faintly.It doesn\u2019t seem necessary to make a memorandum. If Helios doesn\u2019t keep his promise, I can go to the cabinet meeting with a complaint.The whole story is over.I stood up from my seat. Helios followed me to my feet.\u201cHestia.\u201dI gave him an answer by looking at him. Then he opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2019m glad I could make a deal with you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because of my inadequacy Even your highness had been more careful when he stamped the memorandum.\u201dI retorted with a sullen retort.Helios laughed softly.\u201cHaha, next time I see you, I might have to call you the Duchess.\u201d\u201cI hope so, too, His Highness Helios.\u201dReplying with a blank face, I left the office.~~~~After talking to Helios alone, I always talk to Kaelus.Today was no exception.After returning home, changing into my indoor clothes, I visited Kaelus\u2019 room before dinner.\u201cKaelus, I\u2019m back.\u201d\u201cYes, you did a great job.\u201dIt\u2019s the same dry tone as ever, but the atmosphere has become softer.Kaelus lifted the teapot on the table and poured it out.\u201cWhat did you talk about?\u201dI also answered casually to the casual question.\u201cIn the near future, he will promote you to duke.\u201d\u201c!\u201dKaelus\u2019 movement, which was lifting the teacup, stopped.I added with a grin.\u201cHe told me that he would give me the Attica estate.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that what you asked of Heli the other day?\u201dAs expected, my favorite with good memory.Memories spring to mind. When I brought this up in the carriage to Illion, Kaelus even asked me if I had anything to do with Princess Letona.\u201cYes, but foolishly, I wrote a flawed memorandum at the time and didn\u2019t realize it. The Crown Prince pointed it out and asked for a deal.\u201d\u201cDeal?\u201d\u201cYes, I told him I would stop attacking the temple. For the crown princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter this, neither Kaelus nor I spoke for a while.After a long silence, he spoke first.\u201c\u2026\u2026did you accept the deal?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI nodded my head.\u201cHe promised to name you duke before sitting at the negotiating table with the kingdom. In return, I withdrew my plan to accuse the temple at the state council.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re losing so much.\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s my fault. I didn\u2019t find any loopholes in the memorandum in advance.\u201dHelios who used it was also amazing, really.Kaelus\u2019 expression was still crumpled and unfurled.\u201cBut you\u2019re not the only one who prepared a charge against the temple. I understand that Countess Erinnis was also working with you.\u201d\u201cI said the same thing to the crown prince. Someone will accuse them if not me. But he says he\u2019ll stop me first.\u201dKaelus laughed heartily.\u201cYou\u2019re leading the way, so you\u2019re the only one who needs to stop?\u201d\u201cWell, but it was a good strategy for the crown prince to put out the fire.\u201dI murmured bitterlyKaelus\u2019 voice rang calmly as he tried to stir in the teacup without meaning.\u201cIs getting a duke and an Attica estate worth more than what you\u2019re planning?\u201d\u201cMy plan doesn\u2019t go down very badly if it\u2019s delayed a little, but the succession of the title and the transfer of the territory will be nothing even if the emperor drags on his cause. That\u2019s what the memorandum said.\u201dStupid Hestia. Put your hands up and reflect on yourself.Anyway, this has blocked my way to the cabinet meeting myself.It would be nice if there was another aristocrat to come to the forefront instead of me, but the aristocracy who likes to take care of themselves does not have the courage to attack the emperor\u2019s favorite Diana from the front.Everyone hid behind my back. They let me carry the gun.I clicked my tongue in displeasure.\u201c\u2026Hess.\u201d\u201cYes, Kaelus.\u201dMy favorite purple eyes suddenly shone.\u201cYou said the terms of the deal are that you don\u2019t file a complaint?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen it doesn\u2019t matter who it is.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, but there\u2019s no right person. Everyone is busy taking care of themselves.\u201dI let out a sigh.Just then.\u201cWhat if I do it?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?\u201dI didn\u2019t understand quickly, so I just blinked.Surprisingly, Kaelus smiled at me in front of my eyes!\u201cI will personally file a complaint against the temple at the state council.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI looked at Kaelus with a rather absent-minded mind.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 will\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that.\u201dWhy are you laughing so happily?Kaelus, you\u2019re\u2026!\u201cDon\u2019t you know why I\u2019m accusing the temple? I\u2019m trying to bring down the saint! Even the crown prince holding hands with the saint will be pushed to the brink.\u201dI just can\u2019t believe my ears.\u201cAnd yet you\u2026!\u201dYou\u2019re gonna stick a dagger in Diana and Helios with your own hands?You\u2019re going to betray your one and only love with your hands?\u201cHestia, I can do it.\u201d\u201c!\u201dAn unabashed voice.I twisted my face wide and looked at Kaelus.You love Diana.Words that could not come out yet lingered in my mouth.It\u2019s enough for me to get my hands dirty by myself.How come.\u201cHestia.\u201dTears rolled down helplessly at the simple call.I\u2019m so sorry. What should I do?Because I\u2019m stupid, even my favorite is rolling in the mud.To make him betray the people he loved with his hands.Isn\u2019t that all I should have done? My favorite\u2019s hands don\u2019t get dirty, only I get dirty alone.Be ashamed of yourself.At that moment.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe view went black.A warm warmth that envelops the whole body.And a scent like grass.\u201cHess.\u201dRight now, when my favorite is holding me.It\u2019s like a dream.No, it\u2019s like reality.\u201cDon\u2019t cry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to ride the boat with you too*.\u201d*TN: he doesn\u2019t want her to go through it alone\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201cGive me permission. Hestia.\u201dA clear yet soft voice.His arms are very firm, cozily surrounding me.The weight gently pressing down on the back is by no means light.This is the warmth of your favorite.I\u2019m in his arms.\u201cHuh? Hess.\u201dI\u2019m a successful fan.Now that I am walking on the path of a maniac, I have nothing more to succeed.Seriously, this is the end.\u201cLeave it to me. Because I can do it well.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMy favorite is also very persistent.Finally, he\u2019s going to destroy the temple\u2019s honor for me and put your beloved Diana in a corner.\u201cYou don\u2019t trust me?\u201d\u201cNo\u2026\u201dOnly then was I able to open my mouth and squeeze out my voice. My voice cracked because I was choking on my throat, trying not to cry.I was burying my face in my favorite\u2019s chest, but I couldn\u2019t easily get out of it. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be a mess. My eyes will be swollen and my nose will be red.And yet Kaelus didn\u2019t snicker at me. It was just a leisurely, warm hand sweeping down my back.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m making you do messy things.\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dHis answer was heard only by voice.* As if it were natural, it was calm without any shaking or hesitation.*TN: she can\u2019t see his expressionsEven soft and sweet.I\u2019m dreaming now, I don\u2019t really want to wake up.I heard a low laugh on the top of my head.\u201cThen will you let me do it?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes\u2026\u201dWith Kaelus saying this, how dare a fan refuse?I suddenly felt the hot breath that touched my arms and ears.\u201cGood. Good job.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201dA breathy voice.It\u2019s so low that I can only hear it, but it rings in my head like thunder.For a moment, my body trembled and I couldn\u2019t move.A sense of dizziness that makes one\u2019s voice cry out.The view of the study over his shoulder in his arms fades out white.\u201c\u2026!\u201dNo, I can\u2019t. I can\u2019t do this.I need to find my reason quickly before I lose my mind!It is the virtue of a fan that does not cross the line.To imagine strange things about a holy favorite is a profanity that a fan should not dare do!\u201cUh, well\u2026\u201dMy voice crawled automatically in shame. As gently as possible, I pushed my body out of his hands so that he would not be offended.\u201c\u2026\u201dFortunately, Kaelus didn\u2019t force himself and was pushed out well. I\u2019m so thankful.Still, it would have been too disastrous to raise my face straight, so I lowered my head and quickly wiped my eyes with my hands.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, and\u2026 Thank you.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus fixed his eyes on me without saying a word.Then I can\u2019t keep my head up because I\u2019m embarrassed.\u201cThe data\u2026 I\u2019ll organize it and show you\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to use it in a hurry. We\u2019d better get what the crown prince promised first.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dMy favorite finally answered! I took a breather with this.The atmosphere quickly slipped away before it became any more strange. Then, I stood up quickly and bowed.\u201cNext time, I\u2019ll never make a mistake like this and I\u2019ll work hard.\u201d\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026!\u201dThe calm voice made me stand at attention.Kaelus lowered his head slightly and swept his hand up his forehead.Words that come out with a sigh.\u201cHa\u2026 yes. I\u2019ll see you at the restaurant later.\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dWe\u2019re finally free!I scrambled out of the place.~~~~The dinner was as calm as usual. I was so nervous that I was worried that the atmosphere would flow strangely again.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dAs I returned to the room and prepared to sleep, I kept sighing for no reason.It was ridiculous, so I laughed.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with me today\u2026\u201dI think it\u2019s a little off. I still haven\u2019t come to my senses after the extraordinary incident where I cried while hugging my favorite.I laid on the bed and took a deep breath.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dKaelus\u2019 body scent, like a pungent smell of grass, lingers like a hallucination at the tip of the nose.\u201cOh, my!\u201dI tucked my blanket over my head. I\u2019m going crazy with a fever.I must forget it quickly before my imagination unfolds endlessly.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI forced myself to close my eyes and go to sleep. I tried consciously not to think about anything.After a long time.\u201c\u2026\u201dBefore I knew it, I fell asleep.~~~~If you work very hard to be a fan, sometimes you can enjoy the honor of your favorite in your dream.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dAs soon as I woke up in the morning, I sat up looking disheveled.I\u2019ll forget about it later, so I have to think about it quickly.What was the dream like?\u201c\u2026\u201dThinking about it makes my heart flutter again.I was lying down. And from above, Kaelus was looking down gently.I didn\u2019t have sleep paralysis, but my body couldn\u2019t move as I wanted. I couldn\u2019t move as if I was stuck on something.The situation was very sexy even in my dream. Instinctively, I thought that my favorite would attack me.The good thing about a dream is that what you think comes true.As my favorite face got closer, something immediately touched my lips. And the strange feeling on the tongue.If your dream is too vivid, you can even feel the touch sometimes. There was a real sense of something winding around my tongue.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI pressed my finger against my lips and tongue. Well, this wasn\u2019t it. It was different from this.The funny thing is that the moment I felt the strange sensation, I became conscious. Aha, this is a dream. I thought I was dreaming.Then the slowly blurry face seemed to say something.\u201cUh\u2026 What did he say\u2026?\u201dDid I say \u201cIt\u2019s a dream\u201d? Was it \u201cIs It a Dream?\u201d?Anyway.After that, I can\u2019t think of a dream before I fell into a deep sleep again. That\u2019s where the happy dream ended.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dWhen my mind is clear, this dream will soon fly out of my head.But this pleasantly exciting feeling will remain in my heart all day long.That\u2019s enough.~~~~Having accepted the deal with Helios, I had to write to Countess Erinnis.\u201cYou\u2019d better stop working on building a plan\u2026\u201dI wrote it up to here and sighed heavily. Now we have to give a reasonable reason.\u201c\u2026the crown prince\u2026 Get ready to fight back\u2026 I think there is\u2026.\u201dI did not mention specific types of counterattacks. But with this hint, the quick-witted Erinnis will stop doing enough and wait for the right time.The fact that Kaelus is accusing the temple must be kept secret to the end. That way, you can detonate the bomb without interference from Helios.The best timing is when people\u2019s attention is drawn after the promotion of Kaelus to duke.A justification has already been laid out. Loyal to the authority of the emperor and the Imperial court, he will accuse the emperor and the empire of the unclean conduct of the secular greedy temple.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dHonestly, thank you so much for saying that you would do it, Kaelus.It\u2019s hard to think of any other aristocrat who could replace me who was caught up in my dealings with Helios. Especially since I don\u2019t trust the aristocracy personally, I would have had to engage in another political deal to find someone to replace me.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dAfter all, I\u2019ve left Kaelus to clean up my mess.I\u2019ve repeatedly vowed not to make mistakes, but I can\u2019t always handle it perfectly and made a hole like this.The role of a wicked woman who carefully designs evil deeds is by no means easy.I should\u2019ve realized it when I was possessed as an extra. It was just a surprise for me.I intervened in this world to save my favorite, but I only realize my lack of ability every time.\u201cBut you just have to hang in there a little longer.\u201dI comforted myself by talking to myself.Let\u2019s hang in there a little longer. Please hang in there for just a little bit.We\u2019re almost there.Before the regression time passes, the goal can be achieved sufficiently.Those who hurt Kaelus will kneel down and apologize to him, and Kaelus overcomes the wounds and lives happily ever after.That\u2019s why I\u2019m living this life.~~~~A few days later.At last an important piece of the puzzle was put together. Baron Potos\u2019 merchant ship succeeded in sailing.In the end, Helios could not stop Diana.The departure of the merchant ship could only be delayed for a few days, but the departure itself could not be canceled by the crown prince\u2019s authority.Whether or not to sail was a matter of many nobles\u2019 understanding. Therefore, it was impossible to tie the ship to the port with a single command without proper grounds. Because there is a risk of collective opposition from the aristocracy.There is no way to stop the ship from sinking. The only way was to keep the ship from leaving.Now that Baron Potos will find out that the merchant ship has sunk, all investors, including Diana, will be embarrassed.Even if Helios, who knows in advance that there will be great damage thanks to me, secures the Baron Potos family, there is no guarantee that all the money will be recovered.Soon the whole society will be in tatters.\u201cI want you to cry in despair, Diana.\u201dI murmured like a wicked witch.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne evening after the merchant ship set sail.I got a message from Kaelus that he was going to be late, so I had dinner first by myself.The butler Uross said casually.\u201cBefore he got married, he often worked at the palace this late.\u201d\u201cI knew it, but it happened a lot more often than I thought.\u201d\u201cTo add a little suggestion, I was wondering if he\u2019d like to have dinner at home once a week.\u201d\u201cKael hasn\u2019t fully recovered yet, so he can\u2019t overdo it already.\u201dI shook my head. To what extent do these emperor and prince plan to work my favorite?I came back to my room after a leisurely meal. I sat down in front of my desk with the thought of taking care of the remaining work before bed.Still, it was quite disturbing.\u201cIn the novel, it just says that he works late at night\u2026\u201dI feel sorry for Kaelus.In fact, the overtime work of the character in the rofan novel that I encountered was far different from what I imagined.The atmosphere of the night in modern Korea, where the surroundings are bright with artificial lighting, and the night in the rofan world, which has little to rely on other than the moonlight, differ in atmosphere.Even now that I am working alone in this room, I feel a deep loneliness as if I were left alone in the world.What about the imperial palace?\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI opened the terrace door wide because I thought I might hear the sound of a carriage from outside.After a long time.As I was getting sleepy and my eyelids were heavy, I heard the clattering of carriage wheels outside.\u201cIt\u2019s here!\u201dCome to think of it, I\u2019m also very strange. I can just fall asleep, but I\u2019m waiting for my favorite while trying to get rid of sleepiness.He\u2019s been quite kind to me these days, so it seems like I\u2019ve become his real wife.\u201c\u2026\u201dI shouldn\u2019t be like this.Why not?This isn\u2019t my home.Then where\u2019s my home?Wake up, you\u2019re a rofan reader. You\u2019re not a character in a rofan.\u201c\u2026Yes, I was just possessed\u2026.\u201dA lonely question and answer.In fact, I have become more wary of myself these days.I keep getting my position confused.In reality, I fell asleep while reading a web novel at night, but when I woke up, I was possessed by a novel, so I even watched the ending of the novel as if I were experiencing a vivid VR experience.Even after the ending, I still haven\u2019t figured out why I couldn\u2019t wake up from being possessed. Honestly, I don\u2019t even know how to find out.If I collapsed and died in the temple, shouldn\u2019t I go back to the real world? Nevertheless, I am still in the world of this novel under the buff of \u2018return\u2019.What the hell?I \u2018m not living\u00a0 in this world right now because I have a sense of duty. I just wanted to find a purpose because I couldn\u2019t get out of it, and I just fixed it with the happiness of my favorite Kaelus.Literally living while I\u2019m alive.**TN: she\u2019s just existing until she diesIt was the same in my original world, but it\u2019s the same here.Yeah, it\u2019s the same thing. Same.\u201c\u2026\u201dThere is a rush of confusion.Is there a fundamental difference between my previous life and my present life? Is the life where I\u2019ve been reading web novels my reality? And is this just a novel?If I admit that this is my reality, then what will my life be then, which was suddenly thrown away by possession?Why did I go to school for decades and dream of the future and live a life of work?Why? Because I thought I\u2019d live in that world forever.My reality is that I dream of the future. The life that can portray my distant future is the real \u201creality\u201d that I have to live faithfully.What about here?Do I have a future here? Am I living as a Hestia, thinking about the future?Not like that.There is no future for me now. There is only the present Kaelus, and I only do what I have in front of me.That\u2019s why I can act so selfishly and slyly as a manipulative human being. Like a wicked woman in a novel.It\u2019s not my world, so I can be indifferent and callous to everything else in this world.Except for one Kaelus.\u201cGet a hold of yourself! Are you going to live here just because your favorite has been kind to you?\u201dI slapped myself in the face with both hands.Tingling cheeks. Did I hit myself too hard? Tears welled up.\u201cGet a hold of yourself\u2026.\u201dShockingly,It\u2019s lonely.~~~~The next morning.\u201cHave you slept well?\u201d\u201dI said good morning to Kaelus whom I met at the dining hall. He also gave a simple answer.\u201cDid you sleep well? You seemed to stay up late last night.\u201d\u201cOh, how did you know?\u201d\u201cWhen I got out of the carriage, I looked up at your room and found the terrace door open and lit.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI\u2019m a little touched. I can\u2019t believe my favorite was checking my room.At the same time, the confusion and loneliness that I felt alone that night came back to me.\u201cHess?\u201dI guess I looked down without realizing it. I suddenly came to my senses at the mysterious voice of Kaelus.\u201cOh, haha, I was thinking about something else for a second\u2026\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dKaelus frowned slightly and then straightened himself. Then he looked at me with more heavy eyes.\u201cHestia, I have an important thing to tell you.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019ll be negotiating with the kingdom in a few weeks.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI stiffened up with the tableware in my hand.Diplomatic negotiations with the kingdom.The whole country trembled before the threat of war because it was unprepared before the return. Helios and other government ministers rushed around and tried to prevent the collapse.The result is a near-devastating peace agreement. The merchants of the kingdom were allowed to do business within the empire without any restrictions.It prevented the consequences of going to war, but it was never a good thing.However, it changed after the regression.Kaelus, an excellent negotiator, did not die for now, and I informed him in advance of the provocation of the border area and prevented it. In addition, they prepared early for the threat of war.This allowed the empire to negotiate calmly and quietly with its neighbors without sudden fear and confusion.Peace continues unbroken.\u201cYes, I see\u2026 Finally\u2026.\u201dI managed to squeeze out my voice.Kaelus also replied calmly.\u201cWe\u2019ve prepared thoroughly so far, so the negotiations will end successfully. It\u2019s all thanks to you.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I just gave you a heads up, and I didn\u2019t do anything.\u201dIt\u2019s true. It\u2019s useless to just know.Foresight is also useful because there are people who can change the situation well.And another thing that changed before the return. What it means is that Kaelus is about to engage in negotiations with the kingdom.\u201cThen your promotion to the duke will be done.\u201d\u201cAt a cabinet meeting a few days later, the emperor will officially announce my promotion to the throne.\u201dUnlike me who is\u00a0 smiling, he\u2019s always had a nonchalant look.\u201cAnd I told you first that the succession ceremony is not held in a grand manner due to circumstances. We\u2019re running out of time, and we have more important things to do.\u201d\u201cYes, I don\u2019t mind if you don\u2019t mind.\u201dWe can make a small rice cake and smash it.* Should I make it cake instead of rice cake?*TN: idiom for a situation where there is enough of something. In this case, Hestia is saying there are enough rewards coming and that perhaps instead of rice cakes, she should celebrate with cakeA voice is heard at that moment.\u201cI\u2019m going to file a complaint against the temple right after the negotiations.\u201d\u201c!\u201dAnother heavy thing falls on my chest.Finally, the temple.\u201cI decided to do so because there was speculation that people\u2019s attention would be completely focused on the temple only when negotiations with the kingdom were over. But if you have any other ideas, I want to hear them.\u201dMy words were followed with a big smile.\u201cI agree with your plan. If people\u2019s interests are elsewhere, the effectiveness of the accusation will be significantly reduced. That\u2019s the best way to resonate as much as you want.\u201dWhen people\u2019s eyes turn from outside the country back onto the country.When you can eliminate all external threats and focus entirely on internal issues.Diana, the noble saint.I hope you\u2019ll be safe in the midst of a series of hectic hits.~~~~By the way, at this point, there was a desire that I couldn\u2019t control.Facing the heroine Diana alone.\u201cHa\u2026 I miss you\u2026\u201dWhat kind of expression will she make when she meets me in the middle of nowhere?I want to feel her sincerity right under my nose. Despair, revenge, regret.No, I\u2019d love to see her steadfastly trying to keep her faith.Her name is the crown princess who is trusted by the emperor. She must already know the situation inside and outside the country.Kaelus is about to be promoted to duke, and that I will get the land of Princess Letona.I completely gathered the positions of the Duke Orcus and Princess Letona, who were Diana\u2019s enemies.As a heroine, I think she\u2019ll be a bit embarrassed.\u201cI really want to see your face shaking like that. Diana.\u201dI finally picked up my pen.A very earnest letter to the lily palace owner, Princess Diana.Let\u2019s not let anyone step in, let\u2019s face it woman to woman.If you show me your true feelings even a little bit, I can also show you how much I really feel.Actually, you\u2019re curious, too. Diana.Don\u2019t you want to know how I feel, why I\u2019m so impatient to eat you, and how I feel at the bottom of it?\u201c\u2026so please do this humble woman\u2019s request\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a scene from the past comes to mind.When I went to the temple and begged the priest to let me meet the saintess.That\u2019s what the priest said to me at the time. \u2018I can\u2019t let the noble crown princess meet a humble woman like you.\u2019What will happen this time?\u201c\u2026please don\u2019t defeat me, holy princess.\u201d~~~~On the day I got a reply from her, I quietly burned the letter.In the secret place of prayer in the temple.Somehow, I feel strange because it seems like the two of them are connected.I didn\u2019t even tell Kaelus that I was supposed to meet Diana. Judging from the reactions he has shown me these days, he wouldn\u2019t ike it.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dCovering my face with a dark veil, I arrived at the temple.A priest, which seemed to have been instructed in advance by Diana, approached quietly. I followed him to the prayer house like a stream.\u201cPlease go in.\u201dIn front of the door where the priest has stopped. After nodding quietly, he opened the door gently.\u201c\u2026\u201dAn empty room with no one in it.A small candle shook finely as I moved around the white statue.The sound of footsteps rang from my low heels.I came close to the statue. A statue with both arms raised like a benevolent mother.But.\u201c\u2026that is not God.\u201dI murmured to myself.I\u2019m probably the only one in the world who knows the identity of God.If any of the priests had received God properly, or if they had learned the truth of the world.The world wouldn\u2019t be so peaceful.But at the same time, questions arise.What if that is really God?Who brought me back to this world?As far as I know, there are some phenomena that are not fit to be called the \u201cGod\u201d of the world.. No other than what I experienced myself.\u201c\u2026who are you\u2026?\u201dAlthough I did not pray, I asked God.\u201c\u2026\u201dOf course there is no answer back.What is this, I feel empty for no reason.~~~~In a moment.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe door opened silently, and a thin image appeared.Standing in front of the statue, I slowly turned around.\u201cHere comes her highness, your grace.\u201d\u201cHestia\u2026\u201dDiana\u2019s expression was very stiff.I smiled deliberately.\u201cHonestly, it was unexpected. I can\u2019t believe that someone who thinks I\u2019m an enemy is listening to my request.\u201d\u201cI also thought I should meet you soon.\u201dOh, my.I stared at Diana. Then, I lifted my chin slightly.\u201cThen I\u2019m rather curious.\u201dI hope the reason you want to meet me is what I expect.I think it\u2019ll be thrilling to see that you\u2019re playing into my palm.Diana\u2019s blue sea eyes gleamed heavily.\u201cYour craftiness will be revealed to the whole world someday. I\u2019ll make you feel very ashamed.\u201dI stopped laughing.\u201cThat again.\u201d\u201c!\u201dDiana was stunned.\u201cHow impertinent! How dare you\u2026!\u201dBut I was calm.\u201cDiana.\u201d\u201c?!\u201dAn incredibly wide-eyed look.I raised my arms like the statue behind me.\u201cYou know that kind of sermon doesn\u2019t work on me anymore.\u201d\u201cHestia\u2026!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. We don\u2019t need a little etiquette between us. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201dDid Diana not prepare herself? How I will come out of a place where no one is watching.How much do you trust your authority?I looked calmly at the trembling Diana.\u201cIf I were afraid of profanity, I wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing in the last tea time. So let\u2019s be honest.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s throw away our status, our manners, and say what we want to say to each other. What do you think?\u201dI smiled as gently as I could.\u201c\u2026\u201dHave you finally figured out the situation?Diana in front of me seemed to be calming down little by little. Eyes that are wide with astonishment are slowly regaining their light.\u201c\u2026Okay, Hestia.\u201dFinally, the word of surrender, or acceptance.I laughed softly.\u201cYes, Diana. That\u2019s it.\u201dI plodded forward. Before I knew it, we were close enough to reach each other.\u201cI\u2019ll listen to you first. Because you didn\u2019t want to meet me just to do that boring sermon.\u201dHer expression became cold with my voice, which was completely removed from laughter.\u201cStay away from Kaelus.\u201d\u201cOh, my\u2026.\u201dI clasped my hands in surprise.\u201cWell, that\u2019s too much of a line from a righteous woman.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t take it as a joke. Kaelus is too noble to be used for your greed.\u201dDiana\u2019s tone was so serious that I was genuinely dumbfounded.\u201cWho said I used him? Didn\u2019t your husband tell you? I love Kaelus.\u201d\u201cWere you so jealous that I became a princess from being a commoner? So you wanted to take the Attica estate and become a duchess?\u201d\u201cHa, Diana\u2026\u2026.\u201d\u201cShut up, Hestia. I\u2019m not the kind of person you should treat so recklessly.\u201dI\u2019m tired. That endless narcissism.If we stick to this, I don\u2019t think the story will end until the sun sets today.I should change the direction.\u201cThen you considered Kaelus so noble that you condemned him to death.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being contradictory, Diana. I thought he wasn\u2019t that noble to you.\u201dDiana took a big deep breath at my comment.\u201cIt was the result of the excessive affection of Kael. His behavior is by no means moral, but at least his motivation is\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t blame him for his motives, but he deserves the blame because of the results?\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t say what\u2019s not right is right, Hestia. It\u2019s a truth that doesn\u2019t change even if heaven and earth were reversed.\u201dDiana retorted, biting her lip.I smirked at the absurdity.\u201cThen why not allow the opposite? Even if you can\u2019t blame it as a result, you can blame it as a motive. Especially when you\u2019re the target of my criticism.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201d\u201cI understand as much as anyone but you and Helios who criticized Kaelus. Especially anyone who was involved with the Duke Orcus.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cBut at least you and your husband should have covered for Kaelus. If that\u2019s the case, Kaelus\u2026\u201dHis despair always chokes me up.\u201c\u2026\u2026He wouldn\u2019t have wanted to die.\u201d\u201cI swear, I didn\u2019t want him dead!\u201dDiana threw back like a fit.The more she did, the colder my voice became.\u201cAs you said, he was full of affection for you. And yet you never said thank you to him.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t make excuses for not having a chance, Diana. I know you\u2019ve been poking around him lately. But that alone won\u2019t do it.\u201dThen Diana\u2019s eyes became stiff.\u201cKael loves me.\u201d\u201cOh, so what? How dare a princess commit adultery?I laughed my head off.\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re shameless? You\u2019re trying to get all kinds of help from him, like he has to pay for love\u2026\u201d\u201cWhen Kael realizes your true feelings, a sly woman like you will be thrown out without looking back.\u201dWhat a joke that Diana\u2019s confident remark is. I stopped laughing.\u201cHahahaha! It doesn\u2019t matter. I don\u2019t expect that.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how you laugh now because you think Attica will be your land. But I want you to remember what the former owner of the land was facing.\u201dSeriously, what does it matter?Diana still doesn\u2019t seem to understand my real purpose. Because she doesn\u2019t believe in the words that I love Kaelus at all.Well, I don\u2019t have to beg for understanding.I stood with my back to Diana. A large statue stands in front of me.\u201cThese days, what do you pray to God?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI turned my head slightly and looked at Diana, and then headed forward again. Looking at God.\u201cDo you pray for the return of Kaelus? Or do you want your relationship with Helios to be restored?\u201d\u201cI am convinced before God that justice will prevail.\u201dDiana replied in a more solemn tone.\u201cI hope that morality and truth, which you despise, will soon stand upright in this land. That\u2019s what I pray for every day.\u201d\u201cMorality and truth\u2026.\u201dI giggled.My destruction and her victory is justice, morality, and truth.Well, let\u2019s say so. The definition of the rofan world flows along Diana and Helios. Isn\u2019t that what the main character does to do the right thing?I spoke in a serious tone without a smile.\u201cApologize to Kaelus.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care if he loves you or if you have a husband and feel your old friendship with him again. Just one thing.\u201dI turned around and stood facing Diana again.\u201cYou\u2019re sorry for hurting Kaelus then, and you sincerely apologize.\u201d\u201cHestia\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything left anyway. Your husband\u2019s affection has cooled, your healing powers have disappeared, and the money you have drawn from the temple will soon sink with your ship\u2026\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe heroine\u2019s complexion was white and turned pale.\u201cKaelus is the only thing you can count on, right? Don\u2019t you think you should start over from the bottom to rebuild your broken relationship?\u201dI smiled softly like the first time.\u201cSo apologize.\u201dPlease don\u2019t be late.If you hesitate a little longer, Kaelus will put a dagger into you with his own hands.\u201c\u2026\u201dDiana stared at me with her lips closed.It must have been unexpected in her mind. Because Hestia, in Diana\u2019s opinion, is a witch who is cunning with desire.\u201cTell me the truth. You want to be as close as you used to be to Kael.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cOr do you want to restore your relationship with the crown prince? Even so, the key is Kaelus.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe blue sea-colored eyes shook finely as if it was unfair.I shook my head.\u201cI\u2019m telling you the way, but you won\u2019t listen, won\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe you. Hestia.\u201dAn incongruous voice.It wasn\u2019t surprising, so I replied sulky.\u201cDo as you please.\u201d\u201cHeli and Kael are both fooled by your sweet talk, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019ll prove your lies.\u201dDiana, who is determined to be angry.I shrugged my shoulders.\u201cIt\u2019s not hard. On the day you hear the news of Baron Potos\u2019 merchant ship, or before that, show me your healing powers, and I\u2019ll prove it in no time.\u201d\u201c!\u201dDiana\u2019s pretty lips bit mercilessly. Oh, what a pity.I smiled softly, my eyes bent.\u201cActually, you believe in my prophecies, right? You brainwashed yourself because you don\u2019t want to lose.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re wrong, Hestia. You who doesn\u2019t believe in God can\u2019t have the power of prophecy.\u201dShe was right in a sense. I\u2019m not a prophet, I\u2019m a regressor.Anyway, I don\u2019t want to argue whether my prophecy is real or not. Whatever I say, Diana won\u2019t believe me.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s try to prove ourselves to each other.\u201dA smile brought an end to the conversation.After a fresh touch on my dress, I bowed modestly.\u201cThen please take a look. Your highness, the noble saint. This humble little woman will stay here a little longer, pray to God, and return.\u201d\u201c\u2026 That\u2019s so obvious, really.\u201dDiana muttered sickly. She didn\u2019t even match my rhythm and turned her back on me.With the sound of her shoes, Diana disappeared.I watched her disappear for a long time.Oh, my wish has come true.I had a cozy conversation with Diana alone.I don\u2019t feel much emotion. I don\u2019t feel refreshed or upset.Just a calm feeling in my chest.You\u2019re on your way, I\u2019m on my way.Maybe we\u2019ll never see each other again.~~~~Soon after returning home, Kaelus returned home.While having dinner together, I heard the story of the palace.\u201cAll the ministers of state agreed to promote my title.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s great.\u201dHonestly, one or two people might object, but they were also nobles who knew that it was wise not to go against the tide.\u201cAnd Heli summoned Baron Potos to the palace. The reason is to ask about Diana\u2019s investment, but it\u2019s actually to stop them from escaping.\u201d\u201cWell, I knew it. I thought the crown prince wouldn\u2019t just let them go out of his hands.\u201dOnce he has stepped into the palace, he will not be able to go out recklessly until Helios tells him to go out. It\u2019s a much more sophisticated form of detention than surrounding his mansion with guards.However, even if the baron is held, there is only a small amount of damage that can be transferred from his property right away. How long will it take to get all of the investment back?Anyway, what\u2019s certain is that Diana and the temple are in real trouble.\u201cBut Hestia.\u201d\u201c?\u201dKaelus suddenly looked at me with a serious look on his face.\u201cIt\u2019s almost a year.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dHe says it\u2019s been a whole year, but actually I know.It\u2019s already been almost a year since the end of the novel.The night when the heroine and the male character got married and had a happy ending. Kaelus attempted suicide and I saved him. And the next day, we got married.\u201c\u2026I know. Time flies\u2026\u201dMy heart was filled with bitterness.It\u2019s not such a good idea to remember the day you lost both love and friendship and were about to die.And yet Kaelus asked plainly.\u201cShouldn\u2019t we do something?\u201d\u201cWouldn\u2019t it be enough to send a gift to the palace?\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dA conversation that is somewhat off the mark.He rinsed his mouth for a while and then opened his mouth again.\u201c\u2026not the crown prince and his wife, but our wedding anniversary.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI rolled my eyes and looked at Kaelus. I don\u2019t particularly want to celebrate, but does my favorite have a different idea?I carefully spoke.\u201cIf there\u2019s anything you want\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd you?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dI was at a loss for words when asked back immediately.Honestly, I really don\u2019t feel like celebrating this marriage. Isn\u2019t it really a celebration between those who have a relationship to become a couple?\u201cHa\u2026I see.\u201dKaelus frowned slightly, as if he had taken my dithering as a denial.Are you upset because of me again? I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t want to apologize and say let\u2019s celebrate our anniversary.Instead, there is another alternative.\u201cWell, there\u2019s another thing to celebrate soon. Kaelus, your promotion to the throne.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you throw a party all at once? Don\u2019t invite anyone else, just the people in this house. The butler and the lady-in-waiting have all suffered a lot, but we have never been able to take care of them properly.\u201dI wonder if my persuasion with all my might worked. He looked at me for a while and nodded slowly.\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dWhew. That\u2019s a relief.But isn\u2019t that a pretty good idea? Not only me, but everyone in this marquis worked for Kaelus. The effort deserves praise.It\u2019s the only party in the world with people I like.My heart is already fluttering.~~~~\u201cWell, would it be better to be prepared?\u2026.\u201dAfter eating, I laid in bed, tossing and turning, and I was in agony.Seeing that Kaelus brought it up first, he seems to be hoping for something.But I don\u2019t have my own money, and in the end, I have to buy a gift with the money I took out of Kaelus\u2019 pocket, so what\u2019s the point?\u201cIt\u2019s hard, it\u2019s hard\u2026\u201dMy opinion that a gift with a heart should contain a price that is indescribable makes me even more distressed.What can I do to get Kaelus, the Lord of Illion, an item that is expensive enough to beat a castle?Therefore, it is impossible for me to make a gift out of value. We need to find another way.It\u2019s best to give what he wants as a gift. Then what does Kaelus want from me the most?\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026 I\u2019ll be there for you\u2026\u201cI hugged my pillow and murmured bitterly.For Kaelus, I am a dependable person or a friend who he can open up to.He sometimes exudes a strange atmosphere, but it is probably the instinct that stems from his loneliness. It\u2019s like a child being hugged by a mother.A kind of emotional attachment, far different from sexual attachment between men and women. It\u2019s exactly that.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dI rolled over and thought hard.Don\u2019t parents usually make their children attachment dolls? As a means of helping them until they become emotionally independent.Then I\u2019ll have to come up with something similar.What would be good?\u201c\u2026\u201dI looked around the room lying down. There is nothing appropriate.I jumped out of bed. If it\u2019s not in this bedroom, I should look around the other room.I opened the door of the dress room connected to the bedroom. I turned my back and looked around carefully to see if there was anything to give as a gift.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dThe scarf hanging on the wall caught my eye. It\u2019s so warm and nice to wrap around your neck on a windy day.I reached out and fiddled with my scarf. Wouldn\u2019t I be able to make something different with this?\u201cFor example, a men\u2019s tie\u2026.\u201dA cravat sounds good, too.However, I can\u2019t do it with my dirty hands, so I\u2019ll borrow Tekima\u2019s hands. He will make it well as ordered.It\u2019s done. I\u2019ve decided.Let\u2019s make a prop for Kaelus with my scarf.It may be a cheap gift, but Kaelus might be pleased.~~~~After calling in Tekima to ask for a scarf reform, I began preparing for the marquis\u2019 party in earnest.\u201cMake plenty of food regardless of the type. I wish I could invite the bartender who was invited to the dinner of the envoys.\u201dUross, the butler, and Clarice, the maid, also happily put their heads together.\u201cYou won\u2019t have to sign the band separately. There are quite a few people who can play musical instruments.\u201d\u201cThen it wouldn\u2019t be bad to organize a short performance with their skills. There are quite a few people who want to show off their talents, madam.\u201dI was genuinely impressed.\u201cOh, that\u2019s cool!\u201dA party where the people play themselves. The mere thought of it excites me.\u201cLet\u2019s all focus on having a good time, without having to be too polite. It\u2019s a happy day for Kaelus to become a duke, so I hope we can celebrate it together with joy.\u201d\u201cI will bear in mind your wishes.\u201dThe two walked away with a big smile.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI want to have fun on that day. Without any worries, just thinking of pleasure.I hope my favorite smiles brightly that day.I want to see Kaelus with a bright smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was a scene that resembled the owner of this palace.Not long after Diana entered the Lily Palace, aristocratic young ladies often came and went. But as the days went by, most of the people who visited the Lily Palace were priests rather than nobles.And the decisive event.After the marquis\u2019 wife openly clashed with Princess Diana in the background of the Lily Palace, even the few noble friends who were left separated.Even Madame Harmonia, who once helped her both physically and mentally.Diana sat alone in a quiet patronage.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn her hand was a letter from Madame Harmonia a while ago.It\u2019s been a long time since she didn\u2019t reply to her. Still, the reason why she read the letter regularly was because of the sincerity of Harmonia was felt in every line.Harmonia\u2019s words were always the same. \u2018You have to act like a crown princess.\u2019Diana had the hardest time accepting this.People should always be the same, so why do they have to change when their status changes? Isn\u2019t that what she hates the most? Changes with time and place?Why Helios and Kaelus were attracted to her was also her unchanging beliefs and actions.A saintess who lives on the basis of a solidly rooted truth, not a politician who changes according to the situation. Both men loved that aspect of her very much.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t lose.\u201dDiana crumpled up the letter.The day before, I met Hestia in secret and came back. And more determined.I\u2019m going to get Kaelus back.\u201cKael\u2026!\u201dThe sly Hestia attacked Diana\u2019s gaps like a demon. She counter-attacked by strikingly overturning her logic.That\u2019s it. That black villain whispered a sweet temptation too.\u201cTo Kael\u2026 \u2026 to apologize\u2026?\u201dShe almost fell apart.The temptation that leads her to give up her beliefs and morals that she had kept while struggling alone in the palace.\u201cIf I apologize to Kaelus\u2026\u201dDiana swallowed a trembling sigh.She can\u2019t do it.She must never go back on what she said. It is also unacceptable to apologize without sincerity just because the situation was difficult right now.It is so difficult to live up to one\u2019s beliefs.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dShe hoped Kaelus knew her true feelings.Then he doesn\u2019t have to swallow his tears alone.~~~~Helios found the emperor\u2019s residence with Kaelus, who was about to be promoted to duke.\u201cYour majesty, Marquis Kaelus is here.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re here?\u201dThe emperor was relaxing in his comfortable indoor clothes. He was very pleased when the two sons entered.\u201cNow that we\u2019ve passed the cabinet meeting, all we have left is the title ceremony, Kaelus. It\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d\u201cBut with something more important ahead, my heart is heavier than joy, your majesty.\u201dKaelus responded modestly.Helios also said with a faint smile.\u201cIn fact, the Marquis contributed greatly to the stability of the political situation. I should have done it earlier, so I feel late, your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true, Helios. I felt very sorry for Kaelus for not being in a hurry.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s voice sank in confusion.Kaelus did not forget that his promotion to the throne and his wife\u2019s estates were the products of political transactions between Helios and Hestia. Therefore, it was nothing to be pleased with himself.If he recites an accusation against the temple instead of Hestia in front of the emperor.\u201c\u2026\u201dThose two who want to protect Diana will be deeply embarrassed.The current imperial authority gained by Kaelus\u2019 purge of Duke Orcus may soon fall again into his hands.If the emperor and Helios give up Diana, they will maintain their authority, but if they choose to do the opposite.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s nice to see Kaelus with good news today.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m grateful, your majesty.\u201dKaelus responded politely.~~~~After leaving the emperor\u2019s residence.Helios returned to his office as usual. Kaelus also walked slowly outside the Lion Palace because there was nothing more to deal with inside the palace.Then, one person caught his eye.\u201c\u2026 Greetings to the great little moon of the empire.\u201dKaelus was courteous with a cold sinking heart.A soft smile bloomed on the other person\u2019s face.\u201cAt ease, Kaelus.\u201dKaelus, looking at Diana, was confused.He thought she\u2019d never show him that smile again. But in just a year, Diana smiled as if she had gone completely back to the past.She didn\u2019t blame him any more. Kaelus also had no more regrets about her.Kaelus thought it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to just bury it as it is, without considering the mistakes of the past, where all kinds of emotions were intertwined.He had no intention of trying anything to restore the relationship. He just wanted to live their lives in each other\u2019s place without any help, without hate or longing.Kaelus already had Hestia, and Diana was not a substitute for her.Nevertheless, Diana approached softly.\u201cYou must be coming to see his majesty.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dHis dry answer made Diana feel sorry.Would it be better to move places?\u201cIf you weren\u2019t busy, would you go to the Lily Palace?\u201d\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve had a lot of work.\u201dAn inorganic refusal to return her invitation.Diana, contrary to her serene appearance, was deeply lost inside. It was unfortunately a talent that Diana did not have to lead a wooden-stone opponent.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201dShe managed to get a bitter smile on her face.But she should not let Kaelus go like this. She could not convey all her true feelings only when she encountered him in\u00a0 the palace in this way.You have to pluck up your courage.\u201cKael, I heard you\u2019re going to be a duke soon. So\u2026.\u201dKaelus looked at Diana expressionless. Diana was handed something from the maid who followed. Judging from the maid\u2019s attire, she also seemed to be from the new building.Diana had a small cloth pocket in her hand.\u201cI made it to wish you good health. I want you to take it.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know exactly what the contents were, but it must be something like a holy object made by a saintess.Kaelus accepted it for now.\u201cThank you, your grace.\u201dWith a brief thank you, he turned around without hesitation.\u201c\u2026\u201dA backside without a moment\u2019s hesitation.Diana was absolutely lonely.Hestia\u2019s whispers rang again like a hallucination.[Apologize to him.]Does that make everything easier?\u201c\u2026\u201dShe was shaking.Diana closed her eyes tightly.~~~~Kaelus returned home and sat in his study as usual.When he put the political papers on the desk, something in his bag caught his eye.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe cloth bag that Diana gave him.Kaelus had a fundamental question. Why the hell is Diana coming to him?He knew her relationship with Helios had deteriorated. But why does that lead to a change in relations with him?Moreover, he was Hestia\u2019s husband, whom Diana hates.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI opened my pocket for now. As he expected, it contained a holy bracelet with some coarse beads sewn together.Leaving it still on his palm, Kaelus was lost in thought.Diana is under a big illusion.She seemed to think that Kaelus\u2019 feelings will be the same as before.So if she gave him a little thing like that, he would quickly give his heart as affectionately as he did back then.So easily.\u201c\u2026\u201dHis eyes narrowed as he looked at the holy object.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not unreasonable\u2026\u201dA bitter talk with oneself.A man with a crush was about to die because she married another man. Looking back now, it seems that at that time, he seriously threw his reason and lived only in emotion.Kaelus really loved Diana.He really burned everything down, so there was not even a little regret left.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dHe shook his head.He rose slowly from his seat. It wasn\u2019t dinner yet, but he decided to start a fire in the fireplace a little early.A slow flame. In it, Kaelus threw in the holy object in\u00a0 his possession.Soon the bracelet burned black.\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus looked at the shape with an indifferent stare.In fact, it wouldn\u2019t matter if he put it somewhere in the corner, but he would hate it more if Hestia was disturbed by that thing.\u201cHestia. Hestia.\u201dHe recited it a couple of times. A feeling that spread warm rather than hot.How hungry he was for being there even though he pushed away a little out of impatience.Hestia saved him, and his life after that was entirely due to her.Then why can\u2019t he live for Hestia with his free time?\u201cFirst of all, a real husband and wife\u2026\u201dKaelus laughed his head off.A wife who sends infinite affection to him but strangely does not cross any line.He didn\u2019t know how to explain it to her. Love seemed to be love, but he don\u2019t know exactly the identity of it.But it doesn\u2019t matter. If the opponent doesn\u2019t cross the line, shouldn\u2019t he just cross the line?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream, Hestia.\u201dThe lips he stole in the middle of the night were sweet. Next time, he wouldn\u2019t steal, but he\u2019d get it proudly.A smile spread.His heavy heart quickly became lighter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs news spread that Kaelus was about to be promoted to duke, the marquis\u2019 mansion was crowded with people coming to give gifts and greetings.Of course, Kaelus didn\u2019t even bother greeting them. Not only was he not interested in the group who wanted to get ahead, but he came out of the study because he was preoccupied with negotiating strategies with the kingdom just around the corner.Still, I was the hostess, so I sat in the living room and greeted the guests. The sincerity they sent me is fine as long as I receive the gift well and not their heart.I didn\u2019t clean up the presents on purpose and piled them up in the drawing room. To make people feel intimidated every time they bring a present.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dWhen I was alone in the drawing room for a while, a grumpy laugh naturally leaked out.It\u2019s time for the next visitor.\u201cWhoa, Marchioness Hestia. There\u2019s not much time left until I call you like this. Next time, I\u2019ll call you the duchess.\u201d\u201cOh, Countess Erinnis!\u201dA friendly welcome from Erinnis. I was welcomed by a person I knew well for the first time in a long time.As soon as she sat down, she said.\u201cHonestly, aren\u2019t you surprised? They even raised the title of a servant in diplomatic negotiations with the kingdom.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dThe aristocratic society within the empire was unaware that there was a war at stake in negotiations with the kingdom. However, what they knew was that the kingdom was unable to recover from last year\u2019s floods \u2013 a major incident in the original novel \u2013 and that led to frequent plundering at the border with the empire.Due to the complacent perception that it would lead to war, I was in great confusion before returning, but this time it changed. Helios, who exercised his sovereignty on behalf of the emperor, proceeded stably with an outstanding servant named Kaelus.Thanks to this, the imperial society was able to welcome the emergence of new dukes without much sense of crisis.I giggled.\u201cPeople compare me to the Duke Orcus a lot, don\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cPhew, the marchioness really quick at what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201dErinnis shook his head with an obnoxious glance.\u201cWhen everyone heard that Hestia was being granted the estate of Attica, everyone was whispering that the marquis had absorbed the old duke completely.\u201d\u201cWhoa, it\u2019s all the more so because I\u2019m fighting the crown princess like Letona.\u201dI didn\u2019t deny it as it was old-fashioned.Erinnis put the cup on her lips and put it down silently.\u201cBut these days, there\u2019s a strange rumor going around again.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cThe crown princess is wagging her tail at the marquis again\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026.\u201dErinnis was embarrassed and speechless to the end.I burst into laughter because of the rather blatant expression in her usual elegant aristocratic accent.\u201cNo, countess! It\u2019s a perfect metaphor. I can\u2019t believe you hit the nail.\u201d\u201cWell, my words and actions were a little frivolous, right? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cHahaha, no. I\u2019m not surprised because I already knew.\u201d\u201cOh, did you?\u201d\u201cYes. My husband told me first. The crown princess has become kind.\u201dErinnis drew a grin.\u201cThe marquis and his wife don\u2019t have to worry. Both of you are cool-headed.\u201dI also smiled, bending the ends of my lips diagonally.\u201cIt\u2019s not an emotional relationship. In that sense, the crown prince and his wife are quite anxious.\u201d\u201cHmm, but it was just as romantic.\u201dHow can romance feed you? I repressed what I wanted to reply to with a dignified remark.\u201cRomance alone is not enough for the aristocracy and royalty. Isn\u2019t love like a novel only in novels?\u201dI sighed briefly and then added.\u201cBut I guess the crown prince intends to protect the saintess until the end.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. The marquis\u2019s wife stopped making a plan. He\u2019s preparing to fight back\u2026\u201dErinise also breathed a sigh.I said with a certain determination.\u201cBut the temple charges won\u2019t stop. I\u2019m waiting for the opportunity.\u201d\u201cI will keep an eye on the trend of the crown princess, marchioness.\u201dA significant smile between political comrades.There will be only a cliff ahead of Helios and Diana.~~~~After Erinnis returned, Madame Harmonia appeared.\u201cLady Hestia. I heard you have good news, so I came to see you.\u201d\u201cWelcome, Madame Harmonia.\u201dI felt sorry for her thin face. She seems to be having a hard time because of Diana.That\u2019s right. It would\u2019ve been easier if we cut it off quickly. I clicked my tongue inside.My tea was so badly made that I slipped the teapot in front of her.Harmonia smiled a little.\u201cI guess it\u2019s still not easy to kick in.\u201d\u201cPhew, I\u2019m trying, but I\u2019m not getting better. I\u2019m embarrassed, but I have no choice but to embrace it because I\u2019m not good enough.\u201dI smiled softly.\u201c\u2026\u201dHarmonia couldn\u2019t easily move her mouth as if something was overwhelming her.I knew what she was thinking, so my thoughts slipped first.\u201cHer Highness Diana\u2026 Is that why?\u201dHarmonia\u2019s eyes soon moistened.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, marchioness. I\u2019m here to congratulate you, but I\u2019m so depressed.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m most grateful to madam for showing her true feelings.\u201dI asked, placating her moderately.\u201cDid madam hear the rumor? The crown princess to my husband\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter deliberately trailing the end of the sentence, Harmonia dropped her head.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how the most virtuous saintess of all can behave in such a disrespectful way\u2026\u201dSomehow she is sadder than I am. Some might think that Diana had an affair with Harmonia\u2019s husband \u2013 but she is, of course, single.\u201cDo you keep in touch with the saint?\u201d\u201cAs I said before, marchioness. Her highness hasn\u2019t replied to my letter in a long time.\u201dHarmonia smiled bitterly.\u201cI\u2019m not willing to give you any more advice. I\u2019m just having a hard time on my own.\u201d\u201cMadam, you\u2019re going to get sick.\u201dShe shook her head in a lonely way despite the worried words.\u201cMy heart feels empty.\u201dI am genuinely confused.She\u2019s another person who suffers from the same aftereffects as my favorite. She is also suffering enough, if not as extreme as my favorite. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s disappointed because her affection for Diana was sincere.I\u2019ll have to soothe her empty heart somehow.\u201cHarmonia. I want you to think seriously about what I\u2019m saying from now on.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you close the salon for a while and travel to Illion or other territories?\u201d\u201cTravel\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m more worried than anything that madam might get more depressed. Alas, why don\u2019t you help me with my work at Attica estate? Madam would make a great acting lord.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the marquis\u2019 estate?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m about to be granted the vast Attica estate. There must be a lot of work to do. I can\u2019t do it all by myself.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHarmonia is starting to worry quite seriously.I was more persuasive in her presence.\u201cI\u2019ll be so busy that I can\u2019t think of the capital for a while. It\u2019s going to be a new challenge for madam.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNow I\u2019m going to have to ask you a favor, Madam Harmonia. Please take charge of the management of the estate in Attica.\u201d\u201cWill I be of service to the marchioness\u2026?\u201dI nodded my head loudly at the question that came out without confidence.\u201cOf course!\u201dHarmonia greeted me with a much brighter complexion than when she first came in.\u201cMarchioness, thank you very much. Thanks to you, I feel very lighthearted. I\u2019m here to congratulate you, but I\u2019m going back to being comforted.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019ll be waiting for Madame\u2019s reply.\u201dI sent her back with a bright face, too.~~~~After that, I was completely exhausted by the constant reception of the guests until the sun went down.\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201dI was exhausted from eating at the dining hall, so I told the maid to make a simple sandwich and bring it to my room, and then I stretched out to the bed.\u201cOh, my. I smiled so much that my cheekbones hurt\u2026\u201dI\u2019m so tired that I can\u2019t help but laugh. I must have lost my mind.I heard a knock on the door just in time. The meal seems to be here.\u201cCome on in.\u201dI stretched out tiredly, only raising my voice. By the way.\u201cOh my god\u201dAn involuntary outpouring of breath. The body bounced up like a spring.\u201cWhy are you so surprised?\u201dIt was none other than my favorite entering the door!Kaelus appeared with a tray of sandwiches and coffee cups.I gasped in surprise\u201cOh\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t have the energy to come to the dining hall, so I brought it. I can eat here too.\u201dKaelus was really going to eat a sandwich in my room, so he put the tray down on the table and sat down.\u201cCome here, Hestia.\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Kaelus? My heart keeps racing because of you, so I think it\u2019s going to stop any minute.\u201cHmm. Didn\u2019t you have the strength to come all the way here? Then\u2026\u201dSuddenly he stood up with a sandwich, and I got up and came to the table.At last, I slowly sat down on the sofa.\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201dI managed to open my mouth with a flushed face.\u201cI thank you, Hestia. You had a hard time meeting people in my place today.\u201dMy favorite who smiles softly.Seriously, with that face, I\u2019ve settled all the work I have to get today.It\u2019s a very rewarding day.~~~~Finally, the day came when Kaelus rises up to duke.Throughout imperial history, it was rare for the marquis to be promoted to duke. So to speak, today is a historic day.Therefore, I also stood before the emperor as the marquis\u2019 wife. Of course, the title award and the warrant will be given simultaneously on the spot.\u201cA vast estate, heir to Attica\u2026!\u201dI hummed and recited a verse that appeared in the original description of Letona Princess.A refreshing morning air. It was still green outside because the lady-in-waiting hadn\u2019t come to wake me up yet.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dI hummed lightly and spun around.Seeing the dance come out naturally, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m very excited today.\u201cThe land of cold snow and ice! Duke of the North!\u201dI giggled.If I were a man, I would have been the famous \u201cDuke of the North,\u201d but unfortunately, because I was a woman, I became the Duchess of the North instead of the Duke of the North.Well, let\u2019s take it easy. Even if it\u2019s not a Northern duke, which is a typical rofan male character, it means that I am quite the rofan female character since I became Northern Duchess.Good is good. Let\u2019s think in a good way on a good day.\u201cMadam, are you up?\u201d\u201cYes. Come on in.\u201dAs usual, Clarice came at a fixed time. One difference is that her expression is brighter than ever.\u201cIt\u2019s your last morning as a marquis\u2019 wife.\u201d\u201cHa ha, that\u2019s right.\u201dAfter Kaelus becomes a duke, my status naturally rises to duchess.Some people would feel sick to their stomach. but is there a difference? If you are upset, you will bounce back.The lady-in-waiting smiled and said.\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of the party while you\u2019re at the palace, Lady Hestia.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I look forward to your kind cooperation, Clarice.\u201dHer mood is as good as mine, and the evening party seems to play a part.~~~~Since I became possessed, I have acquired a lot and climbed into a carriage.Like me, well-dressed Kaelus is truly admirable.\u201cYou look wonderful, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cReally? You\u2019re beautiful, too.\u201dKaelus replied plainly, but the level of excitement equivalent to the lethal dose already hit my heart. I couldn\u2019t say thank you and was speechless.The carriage, which had become so quiet, arrived at the palace as it was.Kaelus expressed his intention in advance that he did not want to make it grandiose, so the promotion ceremony, which is rarely held in imperial history, will be relatively simple.Perhaps that\u2019s why the air around the Lion Palace is as good as ever.I entered the Lion Palace under the escort of Kaelus.Waiting for us to appear, there were a number of nobles standing in the hallway without entering the hall.\u201cOh, marquis! Congratulations!\u201d\u201cMay the marquis be blessed, too. What a happy day it is.\u201dI was completely distracted by all the congratulations pouring from here and there. The steps forward stopped before I knew it.I was answering the greetings for a long time, but suddenly, the loud noise gradually subsided from the back.\u201c\u2026?\u201dKaelus and I looked back slowly.Helios was walking alone down the hall.Everyone, including us, was courteous.\u201cGreetings to the great little sun of the empire.\u201dHelios nodded with a noble royal expressionless face.\u201cEveryone, get up.\u201dGiven that Diana was not next to him, perhaps she would appear with the emperor.It\u2019s a shame in many ways for Diana and Helios. Rumors of a feud between the crown prince and his wife were already spreading in society.If the two had the will to improve this chaotic atmosphere, they should have taken this time as an opportunity to join hands for show.With his tongue in his mouth, Helios strode toward us.\u201cToday is a special day for both of you.\u201d\u201cI am just grateful for the kindness of his majesty and the crown prince.\u201dKaelus responded politely.I glanced around.People\u2019s curious eyes flew in and stick in. How the crown prince treats Kaelus seems to be the show to watch.The reason is simple. Because the pre-marriage triangle was re-established after marriage. What an exciting drama.There\u2019s one thing that\u2019s different from before. If Diana, who is in the middle, chose Helios before marriage, she leaned toward Kaelus a year after marriage.What kind of ending will it be this time? Will Kaelus hold Diana\u2019s hand again? Will Helios just lose Diana like this?The eyes around us sparkle with low interest.Unpleasant.\u201cYour highness the crown prince, please lead the way in. We\u2019ll follow you.\u201dI exhorted, keeping my tone as calm as possible.The two quickly caught onto the situation. Helios nodded briefly and strode into the hall. Kaelus and I straightened our backs and followed suit.~~~~The title ceremony was held in a standing manner without providing a separate seat for the participants. Only the royal family could sit on the glorious throne on the platform.On top of several shallow steps were large chairs for the emperor. And next to it, the chairs of the crown prince and his wife were placed side by side.From the top seat, a red carpet crossed the hall. It meant that the ceremony was very special and sacred.Instead of sitting directly in his seat in the upper seat, Helios stood with us.When I looked at him in wonder, he said casually.\u201cIt\u2019s boring to sit alone.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dI almost burst out laughing.Anyway, even if Helios was standing with us, I didn\u2019t have much to talk to him. So I looked at Kaelus as if I were asking for help.Fortunately, as if he knew my silent signal, Kaelus spoke to Helios in his usual dry tone.\u201cHow is his majesty\u2019s condition?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too much to walk or stand long. I\u2019m glad he doesn\u2019t look so bad.\u201dHelios sighed quietly.It is already publicly known that the emperor\u2019s energy is decreasing day by day. Even so, it must be Diana who cannot honestly admit it.Therefore, it is a bold decision to appear here today to award the title directly.\u201cHis majesty must be very prepared.\u201dHelios also affirmed my muttering words.\u201cBecause he felt the need to prove his health.\u201dI asked quietly.\u201cIs it related to the transaction between me and your highness?\u201dHelios\u2019 eyes thinned. The tone was blunt, but the answer came out anyway.\u201c\u201d\u2026.That\u2019s a pretty screwed-up remark. Yes.\u201dIt\u2019s a real nuisance. Diana.Wouldn\u2019t it have been better to confess that your healing power has disappeared and establish your authority in a different way?If that was the case, the sick emperor wouldn\u2019t have to stand in front of the jackal-like nobles with his sick body.\u201cHis Majesty is suffering beyond words. I\u2019m so sorry that I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDespite my rather sharp remarks, Helios said nothing.By the way, rumors are so widespread in the society that Diana is distracted, and Helios cannot be unaware of this.What does he think of his different-minded companion?If there were only the two of them, I would ask them directly, but unfortunately, the award ceremony will begin soon.I can\u2019t do it. I have to promise next time.\u201cHis majesty the emperor and the crown princess are coming in! Be polite, everyone!\u201dHelios took a step forward and stood on the red carpet. Naturally, Kaelus and I took a step back.The Emperor and Diana, who appear at the venue soon after. The emperor held Diana\u2019s hand and escorted her with slow steps.Everyone bowed in unison\u201cHonor to the emperor, the supreme glory of the empire!\u201dThe nobles waited with low posture until the emperor fully climbed to the upper seat and sat in a chair.After Helios and Diana sat in place, the emperor ordered us to stand up.\u201cGet up.\u201dWe all straightened up according to our orders.The emperor smiled kindly.\u201cThis is the day where all the people of the empire should be pleased. With the birth of a new duke family in this country.\u201dPeople\u2019s eyes were once again focused on Kaelus.A strong-hearted person who never blushes.\u201cMarquis Kaelus, come forward.\u201dAfter a light courtesy, Kaelus slowly advanced to the upper seat.Diana stood next to the emperor with a tray containing a purple cloak and a scepter symbolizing the duke. Originally, she was replacing the role that the minister should play as a saintess.The emperor slowly rose to his feet. His inability to show strong movements rather revealed his weakness.\u201cUnder your orders.\u201dKaelus knelt down in front of him. The emperor put the cloak around his shoulder by hand. Then Diana gave him the scepter, and he held it out toward Kaelus.\u201cKaelus, the emperor\u2019s servant, declares himself the duke of the empire. In addition, Hestia, his companion, is also a member of the noblest lineage under the royal family as a duchess.\u201dMy favorite, wearing a purple cape and holding a colorful scepter in my hand.As he rose and turned around, thunderous applause and cheers erupted.I walked slowly through the cheers to my favorite. I grabbed the fingers that stuck out and kissed them.We looked forward side by side.The amazing sight of all the nobles at our feet.My heart is full.When the cheers and applause of the people died down, the emperor called my name.\u201cAnd Duchess Hestia. I will give you the Attica estate in the northern part of the empire. Help the Duke and work for the prosperity of this empire.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just grateful for your kindness.\u201dI answered the emperor with modest courtesy..The emperor\u2019s soft voice rang out and headed for Kaelus.\u201cThe duke and duchess, look at me.\u201d\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201dWe held hands and looked at the emperor.A soft smile broke out on the old man\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2019m very happy to see a new duke born during my reign. For the well-being of this empire, be an example of all the people.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, your majesty.\u201d\u201cYou are the pillars of this empire. I hope you will help Helios and I and become an eternal ally of the royal family.\u201dI couldn\u2019t give a quick answer to this remark. Fortunately, however, the awkward situation was averted thanks to Kaelus\u2019 skillful handling.\u201cI will not forget your request.\u201d\u201cThank you, Kael.\u201dI glanced at Diana with only my eyes moving.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA woman with a picturesque smile on her face.The face of the resentful woman who told me to stay away from Kaelus is a lie.~~~~We slowly descended from the top seat.The cheering nobles surrounded us. And the salute that comes in.\u201cCongratulations on the birth of the noble duke couple!\u201dI looked at Kaelus with a proud face. He also faced me with a faint smile.\u201cThanks to you, Hess.\u201d\u201cWhat did I do? You\u2019ve achieved it completely.\u201dSuddenly, the crowd surrounding us began to disperse. Turning around, Helios and Diana were approaching.It was Diana who opened her mouth first.\u201cDuke Kaelus, congratulations. The purple cape really suits you.\u201dCountless eyes were watching this scene now.Nevertheless, Kaelus responded with no tension and a very ceremonial attitude.\u201cI\u2019m honored, your highness.\u201dJust as Diana was about to say more, Helios quickly stepped in.\u201cThe duchess is now the lord of a territory. I believe that your ability will make Attica prosperous.\u201d\u201cI will do my best not to disappoint you and his majesty.\u201dI also responded calmly like Kaelus.Just in time, the emperor began to prepare to leave, so Diana and Helios could no longer stay with us and had to turn around.\u201cMay the glory of God be with you, the empire and his majesty.\u201dThe nobles honored the emperor who left the hall.I bowed down with them, too.\u201c\u2026May it be with you.\u201dMaybe the reason why the emperor doesn\u2019t let go of Diana is because he thinks she\u2019s God\u2019s agent and God\u2019s glory itself.But you have to remember. God\u2019s glory may exist, but it doesn\u2019t stay with anyone forever.~~~~After all the events at the palace were over, Kaelus and I returned home rather exhausted.The butler greeted me.\u201cAre you back, Lord Kaelus?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m a little tired.\u201dI asked the butler.\u201cHow\u2019s the preparation for the party in the evening going?\u201d\u201cYes, there\u2019s no problem, madam.\u201dI nodded with a smile at the reliable butler\u2019s answer.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take a nap and come down. I\u2019ve been run over by people, and I\u2019m pretty tired.\u201d\u201cYes. Don\u2019t worry about this side and take a good rest.\u201dAfter confirming that Kaelus and the butler were heading to the other side of the corridor, I came into my room at a slow pace.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI returned as the lady of a great estate, but personally, nothing seems to have changed.Some say that positions make people, but there is always an essential me that nevertheless remains unchanged.Yeah, it doesn\u2019t change.\u201c\u2026\u201dNot just in one world, but the world itself does not change even if it changes.Hestia, or the common rofan reader.I tried to lie down on the bed and sat up again.\u00a0 I went to the desk and opened the fanatic note.There is no prophecy left now.No, there is one.\u201c\u2026What will happen to me\u2026\u201dIn the months before returning, I suffered quite a lot. I had a serious illness because I didn\u2019t take good care of my health, but honestly, I had no intention of treating it.I was left alone in a boring world without Kaelus, so I had no desire to live. I just lived because I couldn\u2019t die.One day, I thought I was going to die like that, so I tried to see the saintess\u2019 face for the last time, but I was coldly rejected. No matter how sad and angry I was, I ran straight into the temple\u2019s small room, sobbed with anger, and at one point I lost my mind.\u201cThat\u2019s not dying\u2026?\u201dI\u2019ve never died before or after being possessed, so I don\u2019t know. But considering that this world is a novel, the rule of fantasy novels is that I usually die before I return, so maybe I am \u2018dead\u2019 then?It\u2019s pure speculation, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that wrong.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dI brought a box that was well placed in the corner of the dress room. It was the scarf reform that I requested from Tekima not too long ago.I gently opened the lid. The scarf that was wrapped around my neck was now a nice kravat to hang around Kaelus\u2019 neck.This is a wedding anniversary gift for Kaelus today.\u201c\u2026\u201dWill I be able to give a gift on our wedding anniversary next year?I\u2019m not sure.Once I take good care of my health so that I don\u2019t get sick, I probably won\u2019t face the same end as before my return.But before that, let\u2019s think more fundamentally.Do I want to live here with my favorite forever?Can I accept this life as my reality?It was not my will to return in the first place. When I opened my eyes, I possessed an extra in the novel, Hestia, and when I opened my eyes again, I only went back to the time in the novel.Since I\u2019m living again, I\u2019ve been trying to live my life by being a fan.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI let out a long sigh.These days, I\u2019ve been obsessed with these kind of worries. Maybe it\u2019s because I think I achieved my goal?But it\u2019s not completely over yet, and I\u2019m wasting my mental energy on this \u201cuseless\u201d worry.Don\u2019t let my guard down.Diana has yet to apologize to Kaelus. She did not break down with desperate regret.My fate is not so important in this life, where I live as an extra anyway.I\u2019ll bet my whole life on something more important.~~~~The party prepared by the servants themselves was jaw-dropping.The music was so exciting that you can\u2019t consider it a quiet mansion, and every table is full of dishes and snacks.Even if there was no flashy decoration for the guests, the energy beyond it filled the grand banquet hall.Thanks to the pre-announcement that we should not have a separate seat for our couple, Kaelus and I sat in front of a small table in the corner.The bartender, who showed off his skills at a dinner with foreign ambassadors the other day, also enjoyed the party so much that it was impossible to tell whether he came to work or play.\u201cFor the eternal health of Duke Kaelus and Duchess Hestia!\u201d\u201cFor you!\u201d\u201cFor you! Hahaha\u2026!\u201dKaelus also had a rare smile on his face.\u201cFor the Duke.\u201dI felt a lump in my throat.I hoped to see my favorite smiling face at the party. But really, he showed the brightest smile I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201cHess.\u201d\u201cYes, Kaelus.\u201dHe held up a champagne glass, so I lifted mine. The sound of a lightly striking glass.Purple eyes are beautifully bent.\u201cWe have something to celebrate separately.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI held out the box of the kravet that I had brought.\u201cIt\u2019s small, but will you take it?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dThe smile faded slightly from Kaelus\u2019 face. A nervous look.In fact, my heart is pounding and I\u2019m about to burst. How will he react to my gift?He opened the box and checked what was inside.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t resist the bursting of tension and started babbling.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t buy a new one\u2026\u2026 I fixed the scarf I was wearing with the kravet. I can\u2019t tell you to wear it often because it\u2019s old, but if you just hang it in the dress room and look at it once in a while\u2026\u201d\u201cHess. Thank you.\u201dA simple and sincere word, as if I didn\u2019t need any other modifiers.I stiffened. His purple eyes looked at me so seriously that I couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\u201cIt\u2019s the most precious gift I\u2019ve ever received. Seriously, I\u2019ve never received anything better than this.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Um, Gah, Thank You\u2026I\u2026.\u201dI stuttered like my mind was broken.Seriously, when your favorite\u2019s eyes look straight into your eyes, you can\u2019t think of anything and just chatter like a fool.Oh, what\u2019s wrong with me?Then Kaelus called my name once again.\u201cHestia.\u201dI was about to say yes. But at that moment.\u201c!\u201dAnother\u2019s lips that press down on my lips in an instant.Warm and soft, with a fresh scent.What the hell just happened?\u201c\u2026?!\u201dThe red lips of a man that gently come off.Silver eyelashes shake right in front of me.\u201cHess. Hestia.\u201dI was too stiff to respond to his call.A loud noise seems to be heard from a distant place.I could only hear the voice of my favorite.\u201cWhat do you say we become a real couple?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dSomething that hits my heart hot,Tears welled up in my eyes.~~~~A real couple.A pure \u201ccouple\u201d without a cold modifier, such as paper or contract.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe thing that I did to just let him live was so big that he came back to me.\u201cHestia.\u201dWhen my eyes were lost, Kaelus wrapped his hands around my face and made me look at him.The banquet hall was still noisy. Each person held a glass and shouted a toast and enjoyed the party loudly.Only this space with me and Kaelus is silent as if it were a different world.\u201c\u2026\u201dAll the colors in front of me melt and mix at once. I don\u2019t see anything right now. Just the feeling of being full of tears.A man who waits calmly for me who can\u2019t speak.It\u2019s so sweet. My heart aches because it\u2019s so sweet.But.\u201c\u2026a married couple is\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEven though I barely opened my mouth, he waited in a hurry.\u201cIf we are confident in the future we will be together\u2026 \u2026 It\u2019ll come together\u2026\u201dYou can become a couple even if you don\u2019t necessarily love each other hotly.More important than emotional or sexual love is when two different people try to make a family.That\u2019s what someone calls trust and certainty.When you and the other person share your lives, can you clearly picture your future in your head? Or is there no answer at all?Are you confident that you will not regret each other when you say that this person, or vice versa, lives with you for the rest of your life?Can you generously embrace even their \u2018least favorite appearance\u2019 that exists in one another?I am Hestia and not Hestia at the same time.I am a person who has a reality rooted in the world outside the novel and am also a person who has spent a short time in the world in this novel.I\u2019m a commoner duchess who turned my husband into a duke and owned a huge estate, but on the other hand, I\u2019m an ordinary novelist who has nothing but information in the rofan novel.After seeing my humble real self, pretending to be a person with the ability of prophecy that would run out, and having no real ability at all.Could Kaelus still paint a happy future for me?\u201dMy future in this world, I\u2019m not sure for myself.\u201cNot yet, not yet\u2026 I think it\u2019s a little early\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t trust you, Kaelus.I don\u2019t believe in myself.I\u2019m just a big fan of my favorite, and I\u2019m not a woman who shines enough to fit in with the empire\u2019s best man, Kaelus.If this was my reality, I would have lived harder to polish myself.But isn\u2019t this a novel? The world in print that I\u2019ve been reading over and over and over again.At a time when I wonder if even this body really exists.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201dNevertheless, Kaelus answered, wiping my wet eyes with his fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll wait.\u201dHe might be disappointed, but he never stopped smiling.\u201cInstead, we can never divorce while you\u2019re thinking about it properly.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dI laughed at his words, which seemed light and serious.What are you saying?How can I leave my favorite? Kaelus is the only reason in the world for my long life.He spoke stiffly.\u201cI\u2019ll give you my present on the day we become a real couple.\u201d\u201cOh, is it a ring?\u201d\u201c\u2026you\u2019re not surprised.\u201dCan you believe he\u2019s this cute?My favorite is pretty no matter what.~~~~The boisterous party continued into the night. The duke could not easily quench his excitement.In the end, Kaelus and I, who couldn\u2019t overcome fatigue, were out first. Even though we said we would go back to the bedroom, the maidservants and other employees only told us to hurry up and go to bed, but we didn\u2019t think about going to bed.What a joy it must be. It seems that they intended to pour out all their energy that they have not been able to properly burst out due to their quiet owner.Eventually, I left the noisy banquet hall and came up to the second floor with Kaelus.\u201cGood night.\u201d\u201cYes, you, too.\u201dA short but friendly greeting.It\u2019s so Kaelus-like that I smile on my own.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter seeing each other open their own doors at the end of the hall, Kaelus and I went into the bedrooms.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI flopped down on the bed.I crawled into the quilt. Because I had so many emotions and thoughts today, I really didn\u2019t want to think about anything when I slept.At a time when my mind was so slowly drowsy.\u201c\u2026?\u201dA low knock.I forcefully woke my mind that was about to fall asleep and raised my voice.\u201cWho\u2026?\u201d\u201cHess. It\u2019s me.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI was wide awake in an instant.No, who comes to a girl\u2019s room in her pajamas at this late hour?!\u201cKael?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInstead of responding aloud, the bedroom door opened.My husband appeared with his silver hair hanging down in a sexy way. No, my favorite!\u201cOh, what brings you\u2026?\u201dIt\u2019s because it\u2019s dark at night, otherwise my face would have been seen as it was about to burst red.\u201cI want to hold your hand until you fall asleep.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dIf I say, \u201cI don\u2019t need that,\u201d my favorite will get hurt, right?More than that, can Kaelus\u2019 character suddenly change like this? Why are you so aggressive? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201cLike this\u2026 all of a sudden?\u201dWait! You said that you\u2019d wait!Whether he knew my silent scream, Kaelus asked, tilting his head to his side.\u201cDon\u2019t you have to check in bed whether I\u2019m suitable as a husband?\u201dUgh! I think I\u2019m going crazy!I guess my expression was such a spectacle. I heard a little laugh from him.\u201cIt was a joke.\u201dNo, it wasn\u2019t a joke. It can\u2019t be a joke.\u201cI\u2019ll really hold your hand, so I just want to see your sleeping face.\u201dThe question, \u201cWhy?\u201d hit my throat, but I tried to swallow it.If I actually said that, Kaelus might be hurt.How can I hate Kaelus, who has a crush on me? I\u2019d rather be lucky if I don\u2019t attack him.But, as I\u2019ve been thinking about before, maybe a better person than me who has a better future can appear in Kaelus\u2019 life.If he rushed to accept me as a companion, I\u2019ll be so sorry for him in the future.That\u2019s why I hesitated.\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d\u201c\u2026that much\u2026\u201dI shuffled my way into the covers. Kaelus, sitting on the edge of the bed, lightly held my hand out of the blanket.If I want to get him out of here soon, I\u2019d better go to bed soon, right?\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201d\u201cGood night, Hess.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s not think about anything. You\u2019re not thinking about anything.My hands are paralyzed now. I\u2019m not feeling anything with my hands.There\u2019s no one next to me. I\u2019m alone in this room.I hypnotized myself desperately. I kept suppressing my instinct to be conscious of Kaelus.The thumps automatically fills the heart. I\u2019m out of breath.I\u2019m short of oxygen.I\u2019m going to faint.\u201c\u2026\u201dNo way.Am I going to die like this?~~~~\u201c\u2026\u201dFortunately, I didn\u2019t die and opened my eyes. What I see in front of me is the familiar view of my room.Then, the sudden memory made my spine shiver. Maybe, maybe, again?!I swallowed my saliva and slowly turned around.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dBehind my back was an empty bed.It\u2019s a relief, but it\u2019s a shame at the same time.You really left because I told you to. If you let your hair down in such a sexy way, you should\u2019ve done something here.I sighed quietly.\u201cYou lewd devil\u2026\u201dBy the way, I wonder if any of the occupants of the mansion is okay after running like that yesterday. Maybe everyone just collapsed and can\u2019t get up.Slowly I pulled myself out of bed. I opened the terrace door wide and breathed fresh morning air.After a while, there was a knock on the door and a maid\u2019s voice.\u201cMadam, it is Clarice.\u201d\u201cCome on in.\u201dOh, I guess I succeeded in getting up on time.But her face, which soon appeared, was, of course, full of traces of hard work the day before.\u201cUmm\u2026 Let\u2019s get some rest today, Clarice.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. A glass of honey water is enough.\u201dShe retorted. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be okay at all.\u201cYou\u2019d better just do as I say. I know how hard it is to have a hangover.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe maid couldn\u2019t say anything.I communicated instructions to all the duke\u2019s servants through the yard. \u201cTake as much rest as possible today.\u201dBreakfast was also prepared by the butler Uross, not the chef. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t drink that much the day before.\u201cAs soon as the cook wakes up, I\u2019ll make a gift for each noble family.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s nothing urgent, so take your time.\u201dIn commemoration of Kaelus becoming a duke, I decided to give gifts to each house. In this world, cake would be better than rice cake, so I decided to do it.The first day as a duchess peacefully began.I hope it stays like this until the day I reach my goal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAnother shock hit the cluttered society. It was because of the news that Madam Harmonia\u2019s salon, which has served as a social love room for decades, will be handed over to a new owner.It was madam, who was one of the few pro-princess figures in society. Even if she hadn\u2019t revealed everything, most of the customers who visited the salon would have had a hunch that Diana was involved in her decision.This was also seen in the letter sent to me by Erinnis.\u201cThat\u2019s another person who\u2019s taken a leave of absence from the Crown Princess\u2026.\u201dI shook my head excitedly and giggled.Anyway, even the nobles who were hostile to Diana from the beginning.The departure of Harmonia, a representative figure who was intimate with her, was very symbolic. Even her departure from the capital meant that in the capital society, someone who was favorable to Diana was wiped out.Although Diocke was close enough to share tea with Diana, she was definitely not on her side when she had her usual behavior.Therefore, the fact that Diana didn\u2019t even grasp Dioke\u2019s identity proved that she had completely lost her social connections.All that was left for Diana was really the temple.But even the temple pressed Diana with an IOU. For her, she\u2019s been stabbed by a trusted person with an ax.\u201cHmph. Do you think I\u2019ll cut you some slack?\u201dSoon the temple will also sink with Diana. I can\u2019t let you escape alone.Maybe they borrowed Diana\u2019s hand because they couldn\u2019t openly pursue profit in the name of the temple. It\u2019s very cowardly.The sinking of a merchant ships has also begun to cast doubt on the temple.This is because people realized that the temple, which had always been struggling with budget shortages and asked for donations, actually had as much wealth as the lord of Illion.A temple that sympathizes with the people who have nothing is just an illusion. In fact, on top of the heads of the common people, they were immersed in the wealth of wealth. Even when the common people were moaning about the epidemic.\u201cSo\u2026 \u2026 they claim to be servants of God\u2026 It\u2019s really a betrayal of the divine teachings\u2026\u201dI wrote down every sentence of the complaint carefully.It was an oar that had already been stirring even before the water came in. However, thanks to this incident, we will not only row but also sail and continue.But the accusation does not belong to Diana\u2019s staunch political opponent, Duchess Hestia.Surprisingly, Duke Kaelus, once an ardent supporter of Diana, will act.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe hand that was refining the complaint suddenly stopped.Before reading this document at a cabinet meeting, Kaelus faces a representative of the enemy across the border.An ice-cold diplomatic negotiation, a very important task at stake.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dAlong sigh.By the way.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAt the same time, I suddenly realized it.A huge problem that has never been recognized.\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dA fact that didn\u2019t exist before the return, a work that I couldn\u2019t \u2018predict\u2019.It was the safe return of Kaelus, who crossed the border.Why did I think of this now like a fool?The success of diplomatic negotiations was convinced not by prophecy but by thorough preparation.Therefore, that did not immediately lead to the guarantee that Kaelus would return safely.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe absence of \u2018prophecy\u2019 felt by the skin in an instant. It was much more hopeless and frightening than I expected.In fact, strictly speaking, the diplomatic negotiations themselves have not been successful. Helios was the main subject before the return, but this time it was changed to Kaelus.But will my favorite fail to prepare and work for a long time? Kaelus\u2019 diplomatic power is far superior to that of Helios.\u201cYes\u2026 Let\u2019s trust my favorite\u2026\u201dAll I have to do is trust.The negotiations will succeed. And he\u2019ll be back safe and sound.The emperor won\u2019t let him go alone. The duke of the empire is moving directly, so he would be given the imperial guard as a guard.If they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll lie down in front of Helios\u2019 office.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dI held the tip of my fingers still and straightened them out of tension.A world without \u2018prophecy\u2019 that came like lightning at the most important moment all of a sudden.Honestly, I\u2019m scared.~~~~\u201cThe departure date has been set.\u201dKaelus called me into his study and said this quietly.I wanted to be calm in front of him, but my face turned pale.\u201cOh, I see\u2026\u201dI lowered my head slightly to hide my hardened expression.But it seemed rather strange to Kaelus.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s not\u2026\u201dKaelus seems to have interpreted my expression in a different way.\u201cNo way. Is there a prophecy here?\u201dThe lack of prophecy is rather the problem.I tried to force myself to laugh.\u201cNo, a prophecy hasn\u2019t appeared. That\u2019s why I\u2019m worried\u2026\u201dIn the end, I gave it to him frankly.Kaelus laughed quietly.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe took it lightly, but it is a huge problem for me, who has lived this life relying on \u2018regression\u2019 and \u2018possession\u2019.However, the voice of Kaelus is calm.\u201cYou can\u2019t predict everything anyway, can\u2019t you? It\u2019s been like that until now.\u201d\u201cBut I was able to know beforehand what was important\u2026\u201dInformation exhausted at the most important moment of all.So I feel more frustrated.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dAs if trying to soothe me, I hear a very soft voice.\u201cWhat kind of prophecy do you want to see?\u201d\u201cWhat I want to see is\u2026\u201dHe doesn\u2019t need to worry.\u201cThe success of the negotiations. And for you to come back safely.\u201dIf I could choose one of the two, I would wish for the safe return of Kaelus without a second thought.The well-being of this empire is not my concern.I only have one favorite.\u201cThen we can both make it a reality.\u201dKaelus said with a smile.I smiled faintly at him.\u201cPlease.\u201dAnd yet a heavy heart still persisted.It was still heavy.~~~~I felt the need to meet Helios before Kaelus left for the border.I have to talk about it in front of my eyes. It\u2019s a big deal if he can\u2019t pay attention to Kaelus because of something else.\u201cCome to think of it, he was always busy before I returned\u2026\u201dHelios belatedly recognized the imminent invasion of the kingdom. The lack of awareness of danger signals outside the border due to a number of domestic problems was the main cause of the humiliating agreement.Now, it\u2019s gone because of Kaelus, but Helios, who is also busy, may be missing something else.So I have to check it out myself. Before it gets really bad.We arrived at the Lion Palace.\u201cDuchess Hestia, please enter.\u201dI saluted the servant who gave me his permission.Helios was sitting in front of the desk in the office and working in full swing.\u201cAre you here?\u201d\u201cYes, your highness,\u201dNow he greeted me first before I even had the courtesy.He knows that I hate him, but he shows a very favorable attitude. Is there still a residue of emotion that was slightly shaken by me?\u201cYou\u2019re very busy.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same for you? You must be busy trying to figure out the Attica estate.\u201dAn indifferent answer from Helios.Anyway, I didn\u2019t come here to decide who was busier, so I quickly went down to business.\u201cI heard that the departure date for Kaelus has been set.\u201d\u201cPhew. That\u2019s right.\u201dHelios nodded dryly.I opened my mouth with a stiff accent.\u201cHow do you plan to escort the Duke?\u201dHis safety was also directed at me with a serious light.\u201cI\u2019m going to add elite guards to the level equivalent to my escort.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you be more specific? The number of guards, the armament they have, etc\u2026\u201dInstead of answering my question immediately, Helios stared at me for a while.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Your highness?\u201d\u201cEven if I tell you the numbers, will you be relieved?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe hit the nail on the head.Even if Helios told me the exact number of people as I asked, I wouldn\u2019t be satisfied there. Add more, arm him more, I\u2019d be constantly anxious.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d\u201cWe will protect Kaelus thoroughly. He will come back safely.\u201dThat confident way of speaking is very intrusive.What can he do? With some omnipotent power.\u201cYou never know.\u201dUnknowingly, a rebellious reply pops out.\u201cHow can a man be sure of his future when he has no prophecy?\u201dThis is the root of my anxiety.As I no longer know the future of this world, I have no choice but to be defined as a member of the world in this novel.Being from outside the novel, looking down at everything from an omniscient point of view and then falling to the ground in an instant.An indescribable sense of emptiness. Darkness. Uncertainty.In the many fantasies I\u2019ve read, the main character always melts into the world they possessed without any anxiety or awkwardness.But I.\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t answer a single question of Helios\u2019.I\u2019m afraid of the reality that comes to me.\u201cHestia, you couldn\u2019t have foreseen everything from the beginning anyway. This is also\u2026.\u201dI\u2019ve heard this a lot somewhere. The same thing my favorite said.Do you really need to listen to it twice?\u201cThere won\u2019t be any more.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI hate him trying to placate me with plain words.\u201cI will no longer have any prophecies. In the future. Never.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios\u2019 golden eyes stared at me.\u201cMy abilities are gone. I won\u2019t know anything beforehand. How can I prepare for the future without any information? Is that even possible?\u201dIt was despair that did not come in my real reality where I did not possess. Because everyone was on the same terms as me.But in this possessed world, it becomes so disastrous. All the advantages that made me adapt to this world safely have disappeared.I used to be above the whole world on one level, but now I stand on the same level as them and became the same thing.I will compete for survival with the people of this world without achieving anything on my own.How disadvantageous I am.\u201cHestia. Hestia. Look at me.\u201dA voice is heard beyond the blackened vision. The voice of Helios, the main character of this world, created for him.\u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019ve always lived. I\u2019ve enjoyed incredible blessings for a very short time through you, but when it\u2019s gone, you can just go back to your original life.\u201dThat applies only to you. I\u2019m not me.Why doesn\u2019t this bloody charade ever end?\u201cIf you don\u2019t have wisdom, will Kaelus throw you away right away? Do you want me to dismiss you from my assistant? Of course, I appointed you on the condition of the prophecy, but even if you don\u2019t have it, you are worthy enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dWhen there is no answer, his voice rises even higher. As if he was begging me to listen.\u201cIt\u2019s not a sudden thing. You predicted it on your own. Your powers will be lost.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said it was in two years, and now it\u2019s a little earlier than that, but anyway, you don\u2019t have to be so afraid.\u201dAt first I thought so, too. The reason I\u2019m afraid is because I don\u2019t know the future in this world.But a little while ago, I definitely realized.The real reason for my fear and despair. That\u2019s right.Between the two worlds, I don\u2019t know where the real reality is that I have to take root in.\u201c\u2026you know nothing\u2026\u201d\u201c!\u201dAs I listened to Helios swallowing his breath, I gave a bitter laugh.\u201cNo one in the world would really understand me.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026?\u201dHelios. Diana.Even my favorite, Kaelus.I revealed a distant abyss that I could never reveal to my precious Kaelus, only to my immediate opponent who had nothing to do with me.My whole body was losing strength. I should go back now.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026I apologize for the unacceptable manner s, your highness the crown prince.\u201d\u201cHess, it\u2019s fine\u2026.\u201d\u201cI am no longer qualified to serve you. I\u2019ll give up my job as an aide.\u201d\u201c?!\u201dHelios looked at me in bewilderment.I don\u2019t need my role anymore because I don\u2019t have any more prophecies to hand it over.I smiled at him without hesitation.\u201cKaelus\u2019 safety\u2026 I look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201dAgain, focus on the immediate goal.That is the only place I can put my mind to.~~~~I spent a few days in a gloomy mood.I had to be more careful to face Kaelus every day, but I failed to hide my feelings perfectly.I ended up causing him unnecessary anxiety.\u201cI heard that you rarely eat meals these days, Hestia.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI smiled weakly.\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I didn\u2019t really like it\u2026.\u201dHe\u2019s leaving tomorrow, and I\u2019m giving unnecessary worry to someone who has to leave on a serious mission.I don\u2019t know how far I can go.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. All you have to do is get back safely.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI stopped laughing at the immediate response without any hesitation.\u201cI\u2019m sure you made a promise.\u201dKaelus\u2019 purple eyes looked at me seriously.\u201cHess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHeli is very worried.\u201d\u201c?\u201dWhen I looked at him, I heard him again calmly.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d quit your job?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dWhat am I supposed to say?I nodded indifferently.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve done my best. I don\u2019t have any prophecies anymore.\u201dUnlike Diana, who still had the power to heal, I was not a \u201ccompetent person\u201d from the beginning, and I have no money at all.It\u2019s better to get rid of useless titles as soon as possible.\u201cI don\u2019t mind but Heli thinks otherwise.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange. Why would the crown prince say that when he clearly knows what I\u2019ve done to them?\u201dA somewhat sarcastic tone.It\u2019s not even funny. Why did you first treat me like a liar and a fraud and now you pretend to be worried?In front of Kaelus.Recognizing that my mood was quite low, Kaelus spoke more carefully.\u201cBecause he accepted that you are competent regardless of your actions. He\u2019s a natural ruler.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. He\u2019s such a cold-hearted person.\u201dWith that coolness, he used to throw Kaelus out, and now he\u2019s crippled Diana.He says he will protect him, but the evidence is that he never actually follows his will. He is just sitting in the Lily Palace with the status of a crown prince.It seems to be \u201cprotective\u201d enough for him.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI also respond to my favorite person who keeps calling me.\u201cShall we take a walk together? I want to spend a lot of time with you before I leave tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dYou promised me you\u2019d come back safely.I hate the anxiety that fills my heart again. This weak mentality, despite vowing to trust him, breaks down the resolution every time.It\u2019s pathetic.\u201cHess.\u201dWarm hands wrapped around my frozen fingertips.I looked up at Kaelus blankly.\u201cYour hands are cold.\u201dKaelus smiled quietly.At some point, he comforted me a lot.When did it change like this? I should be my favorite\u2019s shade and shield.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dI can\u2019t help but smile.~~~~Only the sound of stepping on the grass echoes quietly.A dark night with only starlight. The moon is not out today either.On the contrary to the stormy inner thoughts, the outside world is very calm.A world that rolls indifferently regardless of my confusion and wandering. This huge world, completely out of my hands, is vague and frightening.Protect Kaelus. Please.I have no choice but to cry out like a helpless creature.\u201cWhy are you so weak? It\u2019s not like you.\u201d\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201dWhether there\u2019s a war or not, whether this empire\u2019s wealth is taken away by the kingdom.My favorite. Can\u2019t you just stay safe with me?How can I breathe and live in this fear without you?If I miss you even for a moment in front of my eyes, I\u2019m going to die of anxiety.If he disappears like this forever.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Hestia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHelios set up an escort almost as much as the emperor\u2019s. Unless there\u2019s really a war going on, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll come back safely.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dNevertheless, one in a million.What if one of the literally 10,000 cases goes wrong? My heart keeps sinking because of the various imaginations that occupy my head in an instant.\u201cIt\u2019s weird because you\u2019re always brave.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a criticism, it\u2019s a concern, Hestia.\u201d\u201dKaelus stopped and looked closely into my eyes.\u201cIs it such a big problem that you don\u2019t have the prophecy to be safe?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI swallowed my breath and tears.\u201cBut there\u2019s been a lot of unforeseen things that have happened, but why this time\u2026\u201dNot in a reproachful tone, but in a sincere way of consoling.The white and beautiful hands of my favorite gently covered the top of my head.\u201cBelieve in the time we spent together. Hestia, as proof of the past when I was able to prepare thoroughly thanks to your wisdom.\u201dHe lowered himself before me and looked up at me.\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid of the future, look at the past and the present that you overcame. These are the things that guide you when you are in an endlessly difficult situation.\u201d\u201cGuidance\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, without prophecy, we can draw enough of the future. There\u2019s a mirror of the past and the present.\u201dKaelus smiled softly at me.\u201cI have a future that I can definitely draw right now. Come back safely, be a true couple with you and be with you from now on.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dCrying crept out of my throat. It\u2019s no use biting my lips.My favorite\u2019s voice made me smile.\u201cBut I\u2019m actually a little nervous.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dFingers swept the moistened corners of my eyes.\u201cI think Helios is quite interested in you.\u201d\u201c!\u201dMy heart stopped beating for a moment.I wished you wouldn\u2019t let your heart drop like that, but you idiot!\u201cSo I\u2019m definitely going to come back. I can\u2019t budge a step this time.\u201dKaelus chuckled as he stood up.\u201cSo you can count on it. If my legs are cut off, I\u2019ll crawl back with both arms.\u201d\u201cKael\u2026!\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I promise I\u2019ll be back in front of you with all my limbs.\u201dKaelus reassured me with his sincerity, so I should stop responding.Let\u2019s put aside tears and anxiety for a while, and lighten his heart.I turned my head with a jerk.\u201cNot only that, but you have to come back with a healthy face. Your face is the most handsome in the world.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a given.\u201dKaelus responded by putting his forehead to mine.Then, let\u2019s move on to a very natural flow.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe two lips met. And soon they dug in hot.It got entangled violently without breathing.A perfectly still worldIt was filled only with Kaelus.~~~~The night went on without a hitch.\u201cIt\u2019s very late. You\u2019re leaving in the morning, so go to bed.\u201dI stood in the hallway on the second floor and hurried Kaelus.Don\u2019t you have to be in a carriage for a long time? Just sitting still will exhaust your strength.The scoundrel pushed his back forcibly.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get some sleep. You need physical strength to go a long way.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dKaelus turned reluctantly.Confirming that he took a few steps, I trudged into the room.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI dragged my weak legs.I flopped down on the bed and stared blankly at the ceiling.\u201c\u2026\u201da hallucinating kiss in the garden.The lips and the texture of the tongue are still vivid. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s ordering me to never forget this sense.But when I lie alone in the dark, the anxiety that rises like a ghost permeates my heart again.\u201cSuch\u2026.\u201dA grimace. I cried with bated breath for fear of being heard.Please let him be safe. Please let him be safe.I prayed and prayed endlessly to the God of this world, who had been resentful and ridiculed.If I concentrate on my immediate favorite, I can forget the fundamental fear that encroaches me.The only string that can hold me as I am lost and wandering in my original world is Kaelus.Never again, I don\u2019t want to live in a terrible world like before the return.The life where Kaelus disappeared and I continued without meaning. I\u2019m afraid to experience that black time again.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dThe only reason I live.I didn\u2019t know it would be so scary to see my favorite go to a far place beyond my reach.In the meantime, he didn\u2019t rely on me. Actually, I was relying on him for my life.I\u2019m crying like that.\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe bedroom door opened silently.And without time to even scream.\u201c!\u201dA heavy shadow that looms above the bed.The familiar body scent and fiery body temperature pressed me down strongly.\u201cheut\u2026!\u201dIt was my favorite. The only reason I live in this world, my beautiful Kaelus.When I realized the identity of the shadow, all kinds of emotions that could no longer be suppressed burst out at once.\u201chaeup!\u201dHot breath rushed over my lips. Between the slightly open lips, something hot and soft broke in mercilessly.My mind went blank. My view became blurry, too. A vine of tongue tore through me fiercely.\u201cUhhh\u2026!\u201dAt first, I gave up my lips and then my whole body.Long, beautiful fingers laced through mine and soon four legs were a tangled mess.The stacked body was as hot as fire. At the gesture of rubbing like a beast, my temperature became like his and heated up.I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m sharing my body with Kaelus.But the clear five senses proved it. In every breath there was Kaelus.The ones that occupied my lips came off at last.\u201cAh\u2026 Hess\u2026.!\u201dA voice full of lust, which had never been heard before, tickled my ears.I shivered all over without realizing it. The shiver ran through the body.\u201cKa, Kael\u2026.\u201dWhat is happening to me. Is this really okay?With my beautiful favorite, like this.To roll around in disorderly roll.\u201c\u2026!\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t continue my thoughts any longer. Kaelus\u2019s fiery hand began to run wildly through the hem of my robe.In an instant, my round chest was revealed. I instinctively raised my hands and covered my chest.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKaelus smirked, and removed my cold hands from my chest. Then, he dragged down my underwear as if it were punishment.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dI trembled helplessly. Kaelus\u2019 purple eyes swept down my bare naked body.I can\u2019t stand it. I\u2019m ashamed. I closed my eyes tightly.\u201cKael, stop\u2026\u201dBut there was no answer. Instead, the sound of undressing was heard even with my closed eyes.A horribly low voice called me.\u201c\u2026Hess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t bear to open my eyes. After that, Kaelus didn\u2019t call my name anymore.Two complete bodies overlapped on the bed. Hot, moist lips bit my earlobes. The moist tip of his tongue licked my skin.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dA chilling sensation that made my whole body flinch ran down the spine from the top of my head to my toes. The five senses of the whole body were awake at once. The deep part of the lower abdomen throbbed with the breath of Kaelus that brushed against the skin. This feeling stimulated the muscles inside the pussy.\u201cOh, well\u2026!\u201dAlas. Here it comes. I\u2019m afraid and glad of this sense that will devour me.The arms, legs, chest and stomach, and thighs were in close contact with each other\u2019s. His legs moved naturally and spread my legs. A hard, hot dick weighed down the swollen mound.A short kiss was sprinkled finely around my neck and collarbone. A body that keeps getting buried.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI twisted my body, unable to resist the tickling pleasure of riding up. But my struggle was as insignificant as a slight rebellion, because of the heavy weight of my body.\u201cHa\u2026 Hess\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe voice that bursted out like a sigh was very hot. As if he\u2019s going to get burned if he touches me.A round breast clasped in his grasp. As if in a trance, he rubbed my chest in his hand. The tip of the tongue licked and cleaned the nipple, like sweet cotton candy.\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dAn almost lightning-like shock.My body was already as sensitive as if it were not mine. The body began to prepare for union in earnest. Deep between the legs became hot and moist.How did I know? His long, delicate fingers slipped down my thighs and scratched gently underneath.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s wet.\u201dA languid voice rang satisfactorily.My face flushed with heat. I don\u2019t know what it looks like. I didn\u2019t even know I was shy in front of my favorite.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hess? I\u2019m very happy.\u201dKaelus\u2019 long fingers slowly entered. I couldn\u2019t make a sound, just opened my lips and puffed out my breath.\u201cHa, hah\u2026!\u201d\u201cJust hang in there. I\u2019ll make it painless.\u201dThe sticky whispering voice is terribly decadent. I doubt it\u2019s the Kaelus I\u2019ve known so far.I raised my trembling hand and touched Kaelus on the shoulder. The hard muscles were felt in the palm of my hand. I realized it again. He\u2019s a man, too. A healthy male who desires to sleep with a woman.\u201cAh, ah\u2026!\u201dReason grew numb. The foreign body that penetrated the body was soft and persistent. I shook my head here and there for the pleasure of the frantic invasion. A faint groan escaped through my lips.Kaelus, who seems to be somewhat amused.\u201cYou\u2019re quite sensitive, Hess. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better.\u201d\u201cKa, el\u2026!\u201dMy heart pounded hard. He\u2019s tasting every inch of my body and touching it. All I can do is give up my naked body and struggle underneath him.\u201cAh, uh\u2026.\u201dThe stimulus continued. Gradually, the inside of the lower abdomen clumped together.And then at some point.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI couldn\u2019t even groan and jumped up. Kaelus finally found the most sensitive place.\u201cIs it here?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026! Ugh!\u201dI couldn\u2019t control the joy that overflowed my whole body. The waist and pelvis were twisted and shaken arbitrarily. The struggling legs kept slipping on the smooth quilt.\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201dA low-pitched laugh. My mind went blank.\u201cOh, yes\u2026!\u201dUnthinkable, nothing but a beastly instinct. As if I would not miss even a small stimulus, my whole body\u2019s senses stood on edge.The murky noise sounded embarrassingly loud. I could feel the swelling of the pussy filled with wetness.Was I this obscene? I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m spreading my legs in front of my favorite. To my shame.\u201cUmmm\u2026!\u201dI bit my lips again.Despite my desire to hide, Kaelus\u2019 kiss was just sweet. He wrapped his tongue around mine around and around, sticky and soft, and persistent as if with a little obsession.\u201cHuh\u2026!\u201dTop and bottom are committed at the same time. The sharp pleasure is scratching me like a log.I can\u2019t stand it any longer. I feel like I\u2019m going to faint like this.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dIn an instant a small climax struck. My whole body trembled. The body, which had been fully stretched, was loosened.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s frantic under the bridge. The muscles in the inside of the pussy were fluttering.My body, eager for a man.\u201cHa, Hess\u2026\u201dKaelus pulled out his stuck finger and licked it. Far from being obnoxious in the blatant display of lust, my heart beats.My most beautiful favorite. My love. My Kael.No more, take me.His hands held each thigh apart with force. A hot, hard dick sharply pressed the wet part.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going in.\u201dAs soon as the short notice was over, it pushed in.\u201cUgh!\u201dEven though I was already ready to combine, my body was too soft and weak to accept what was big and strong. A scream broke out in frustration.\u201cHa, ha\u2026!\u201dAt one stroke to the end, Kaelus tilted his head back. A shivering groan a look of joy as if to quench one\u2019s deep thirst.I\u2019m satisfied, too. I\u2019m rejoicing.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dI was just panting. I didn\u2019t even groan at the pain of my raw flesh being ripped apart.A kiss of apology sank gently on my forehead. His breath was shaking as well.I barely opened my eyes and looked at him. I raised my hand and placed it on Kaelus\u2019 face.\u201c\u2026\u201dI told him with my eyes. I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t hold it in. Pour it all out. As you wish.The purple jewels glistened as if they were holding tears.\u201cHess\u2026 I love you\u2026\u201dI smiled without saying anything. I\u2019m a little bit upset about the pain, but I\u2019ll still do my best.\u201cAh\u2026 Hess\u2026\u201dHis voice broke out like a breath. The brilliant silver hair fell on me like a waterfall.As soon as the lower body in contact seemed to have fallen slightly, it hit hard.\u201cOh my god\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dThe blazing eyes penetrated sharply. Flames flared before my eyes.\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt was a strong confrontation again. A ball of hot fire exploded in the body. The whole body flared up. My lips opened and I burst out of breath.\u201cOh, my God! Oh, my God.\u2026! Oh, my God!At last he began to move. The long silver hair shook like curtains. The overflow of affection burst forth violently.\u201cYes! Oh\u2026! Ahhhhhhh!\u201dThe flesh clattered against each other. The noise that\u2019s going through the cracks. Even the harsh breathing that he gasps out.Everything felt by the five senses was breathtaking. The giddy and ecstatic pleasure completely stained the body and spirit.\u201cHa\u2026! Ha\u2026!\u2026! Oh my God\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh! Ahhhhh\u2026! Sigh\u2026!\u201dOh, it\u2019s working. I\u2019m groaning beneath the man.I\u2019m his. Not only the mind but also the body.I will give my everything to my fascinating favorite.Now, I mean, it\u2019s all predatory.My Kael.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dThe intense lightning-like pleasure penetrated deep into the body. The flames, which were burning, spread all over the body in an instant. An unbearable heat. I bent my neck and twisted my back.\u201cGasp! Oh my! Ha\u2026! Ha\u2026!\u201dKaelus fell into a trance, and just drove in and out like a beast. His breathing became increasingly rough. The muscles of the whole body swelled up.\u201cAh! Ah\u2026!\u201dMy eyes began to turn white. My instincts cheered loudly.\u201cOh my god!\u201dAt that moment, the glare of silver fell like a waterfall from head to toe. The whole body contracted vigorously as if it had been electrocuted by an electric current. The muscles that embraced Kaelus tightened.My dear Kaelus had also climaxed.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dHe moaned loudly and poured hot sperm into my body.The two bodies that hugged each other trembled. And immediately after that, the bodies that had exhausted their strength collapsed.\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026\u201dKaelus, who scratched me sharply, left an indelible mark on my body and mind.\u201cGasp\u2026 Gasp\u2026.\u201dKaelus managed to lift his arm, breathing heavily. Sweaty arms wrapped around my waist like a vine again and pulled me in.\u201cHess, there\u2019s still a lot of night left.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dAs if he were still hungry, he ran greedily over my lips again.\u201cUhhh \u2026!\u201dIt can\u2019t be helped. If you\u2019re still hungry, I just have to give you the floor.Eventually, he was engraved into my body so that the starlight that came to mind that night would fall.~~~~The day had dawned.In the end, I greeted the morning with little sleep.\u201c\u2026\u201dWithout a word, a heavy arm stretched out from behind and wrapped me around.\u201c\u2026We have to get up. You\u2019re leaving soon.\u201dI squeezed out a voice that couldn\u2019t bear to come out. I thought I\u2019d cry if I looked back, so I kept my back turned on him.\u201cStop getting up.\u201d\u201cHess.\u201dSuddenly, a strong force pulled on my shoulder. I was forced to turn around.Long, soft silver hair trapped me.\u201cHestia.\u201dThe purple eyes that only contained me are very pretty.Smooth skin. Beautiful muscles that are delicately curved are connected along the chest and abdomen.\u201cYou\u2019re still crying.\u201dHis expression seems somehow amused.\u201c\u2026\u201dI turned my head away from his gaze. Despite the melancholy feeling, my face instantly flushed.His lips bit my earlobe.\u201cThe sound you made all night long lingers in my ears. What should I do?\u201d\u201cKael, stop\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I knew your crying was this pretty, I would have done it earlier.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dKaelus\u2019 hand kept touching the wrong place. I raised my trembling hand and tried to grab him.\u201cStop\u2026 the time\u2026\u201dAt this rate, he would not even be able to eat breakfast and ride the carriage. A carriage ride on an empty stomach is a lot of work.But whether you know how I feel.\u201cOne last time, Hess.\u201dKaelus skillfully squeezed between my legs.I couldn\u2019t stop him any more.My legs struggled helplessly, sliding on the quilt, as my body laid heavy again.Once again, we shared our body temperature under the already bright world.\u201cWell, Kael\u2026!\u201dKaelus also knew that he was running out of time. A lost touch penetrated between my legs without hesitation. The tender skin, tinged from accepting a man all night, spilt greedily again.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s ridiculous. I feel like my body has been completely tamed by him overnight. How can it be this easy? Was I this hungry for men?Kaelus folded his eyes and smiled.\u201cWhat? You like it so much.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dMy face flushed with heat. I couldn\u2019t make any excuses because of my honest body.Kaelus lifted his chin proudly and looked at me. Then he grabbed my thighs and lifted them up.\u201cOh, Kael\u2026!\u201dThe sound immediately went to my pelvis at once. The wind revealed the inside of the valley, which should be hidden in the most secret place. In my moment of embarrassment, Kaelus buried his face there.\u201cHa!\u201dThe hot, soft tip of the tongue penetrated the pussy. I felt a completely different sensation from his fingers, and without realizing it, I put strength into my waist.A soft voice.\u201cHere you are. Your scent is the strongest.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dI turned my head suddenly. How can you say such racy words with such a normal face?\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough\u2026 If you don\u2019t get ready\u2026\u201dI raised my trembling hand and pushed Kaelus\u2019 head, which did not fall between my legs. I bit my lips so that I wouldn\u2019t be caught having sexual desire. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll let out a shallow moan.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dBut overshadowing my efforts, he really caressed me with great care.My hand that pressed down on his head was\u00a0 gradually drained of strength.\u201cUh, stop, stop\u2026!\u201dHot liquid flowed incessantly from the inside.I\u2019m going crazy. I really have to stop, but honestly, I don\u2019t want to stop. I love the pleasure that my favorite gives. My body wants him more than my heart.\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026!\u201dAs he slowly reached his limit, Kaelus finally raised his head with a long sigh.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dHe licked his lips with his red tongue. With that giddy decadence, I could only stare blankly at him.Suddenly he smiled deeply.\u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore either.\u201dThe stiffly swollen man settled at the entrance of a wet woman. And then.\u201cHa\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dThe pain of an unfamiliar union. But I was willing to endure it.Because this pain is only for a moment, knowing that greater joy will come later.\u201cHa, ha, ha\u2026!\u201dTo the groans of Kaelus, the plop of our genitals made a loud noise on the bed.There was no time to be embarrassed. He\u2019s only a beast with his mouth open and panting.\u201cYes! Oh, yes\u2026! Ugh!\u201dUnable to afford a leisure feast, Kaelus was ferocious from the start. His pushing motion shook my body violently up and down.\u201cHa, ha\u2026! Ha\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh! Ah! Ah! Ha!\u201dWith the goal of reaching our peak quickly, Kaelus and I just gasped like a beast and focused on mating.And finally.\u201cOh my God\u2026!\u201d\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dThe rapturous morning sex came to a halt. The attached man and woman trembled together and soon fell.\u201cHa, ha\u2026\u201dKaelus snorted, sprawled on my chest.\u201cHahaha\u2026 It\u2019s a big deal\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get up\u2026\u201dI held back my tears and hugged Kaelus\u2019 head without saying a word.It was really time to leave.~~~~A carriage from Helios arrived at the front door. Kaelus stood in front of me wearing the kravet I gave him as a wedding gift.The head of the escort saluted him with respect.\u201cHis majesty and the crown prince have ordered you to be safe.\u201d\u201cI should say thank you.\u201dKaelus\u2019 expression was as sober as ever. I couldn\u2019t find the face that was filled with excitement until just now.After loading up all the necessary luggage, he looked back at the duke\u2019s servants in the row.\u201cWhile I\u2019m away, remember that Hestia is your only master.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201dThe butler Uross replied on behalf of the servants.I was the last person Kaelus greeted just before he got on the wagon.Instead of facing each other, he held me in his arms and whispered in my ear.\u201cDon\u2019t think uselessly, trust me and wait in this house, Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t let go of the gift you gave me for a moment. So you should keep thinking about me.\u201d\u201cYes, Kael.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go straight to bed as soon as I get back, so be prepared.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dHe smiled with satisfaction. Our lips touched lightly and fell apart.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be back.\u201dAfter saying goodbye, Kaelus stepped into the carriage without hesitation.The wheels of the carriage slipped quietly, followed by a mounted manor.But more soldiers were waiting outside the mansion for a carriage with Kaelus in it. Indeed, Helios did not break his promise, but sent Kaelus with elite soldiers on the level of escorting the emperor.\u201c\u2026\u201dNevertheless, there are things that can\u2019t be helped with human resources.I can never sleep comfortably until my favorite returns safely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Kaelus departed for the border, many letters were sent to the duchy.The content is mainly about successful negotiations and wishing for the safe return of my favorite. Even if it was to send it out of courtesy, I was desperate for him.If more people wish for it, I think \u201cGod\u201d will hear it.I used to think the God of the world was ridiculous, but it changed dramatically.But I didn\u2019t go to the temple with my own feet. The temple has already lost its trust not only to me but also to the general public.Even though Helios did not officially disclose how it was known, Diana\u2019s debt spread to the social circle.Even Erinnis, who acts as the representative of the victims\u2019 group, was very excited.\u201cEven people with a lot of investment experience like me don\u2019t invest that much money in one place at a time!\u201dI sipped my tea and nodded.\u201cBecause she has no experience.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s not spare money, it\u2019s borrowed money. Oh, my God\u2026\u201dErinnis put her finger to her forehead.I responded calmly.\u201cShe borrowed it from the temple, too. It\u2019s like a year\u2019s budget.\u201d\u201cReally, the more I think about it, the more ridiculous it is, duchess.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026.\u201dModerately replying to Erinnis, but in fact my mind was completely in the left field.At first, Kaelus said that he would send news often, but I refused. It\u2019s much more important for him to finish his work safely and come back unscathed than to try to break the news to me.He told me to wait, so I\u2019ll wait.In the face of things that I can\u2019t do with my own power right now, I have no choice but to stay even if I am powerless.I have to endure it day by day. Even if fear surrounds me like a swamp.\u201cDuchess? Are you okay?\u201dThe sudden call brought me to my senses.\u201cOh, yes, of course. I\u2019m sorry. I was thinking about something else for a second.\u201dErinnis smiled generously at my honest apology.\u201cI understand, Hestia. You\u2019re worried about Duke Kaelus.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI affirmed with a long sigh.Erinnis nodded quietly, and suddenly her eyes shone.\u201cBy the way, duchess. There\u2019s something strange going on in the Lily Palace.\u201d\u201cAt the Lily Palace? Is it the saint again?\u201dDoes Diana have a disease that kills her if she doesn\u2019t get into an accident for a second? Why are you so busy when you\u2019re under arrest in the palace?Erinnis shook her head.\u201cShe\u2019s emphasizing that he\u2019s from the new shrine, and she\u2019s holding a prayer meeting for hours every day in the grand banquet room of the Lily Palace.\u201d\u201cPrayer? For what?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of things. \u2018Let me pay my debts safely, or the return of the Duke Kaelus\u2019.\u201dI\u2019m grateful to hear that, but it\u2019s very uncomfortable to say that it\u2019s Diana.Erinnis clicked her tongue.\u201cI\u2019m glad if it\u2019s a pure heart, but to be honest, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYeah, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. I have had a throbbing headache.\u201cWhat does she think people say?\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhoa, would she be a crown princess if she knew that? And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone around her who can tell her what\u2019s going on.\u201dErinnis snorted.Diana\u2019s reputation was abysmal, no longer down to earth. She was revered as a saint when she married the crown prince.This was the result of self-isolation, citing beliefs and morality. Now no one acknowledges Diana\u2019s beliefs or believes in her morality.I would be puzzled. Why is this the result even though she lived so hard as an example?Of course everyone but her knows why.Erinnis affirmed.\u201cThe saint may have sought justice, but she didn\u2019t respect people.\u201dI agree with her.And one more thing.Diana failed to realize the extremely basic humility that can only be learned by going through ups and downs in life, due to the flowery path of lady rofan.There is nothing else to say except that it is a misfortune to be a cider heroine.~~~~Harmonia finally cleared up the salon and left for Attica.Before she left, she came to greet me as a duchess.\u201cShouldn\u2019t I stay with the duchess until he comes back\u2026\u201dWith an apologetic face, she blurted out the end of the sentence.I shook my head.\u201cI\u2019m fine, Harmonia. But thank you for your concern.\u201dEven if madam tries to comfort me with words, it\u2019s of no use to me.Instead, I clearly identified what to do in the future.\u201cPlease report the situation in Attica as honestly as possible. It\u2019s better to separate objective facts from madam\u2019s opinions.\u201d\u201cYes, I will not forget what the duchess said.\u201d\u201cThe most important thing madam needs to focus on is to build a positive relationship between Attica\u2019s retainers and myself. I hope you can make the most of your experience in running a salon.\u201dHarmonia smiled.\u201cThank you for giving me such a big role, duchess.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll cheer for Madame\u2019s success.\u201dShe showed me some grace, and left in an energetic manner.~~~~After living and moving for a while, I was empty again.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn order to forget the emptiness, I have no choice but to find something to do and cling to it.What I am most desperate for now is the desperate regret that the heroine abandoned my favorite.Perfectly removed Harmonia from Diana. Not only the mind, but also the physical distance.Completely isolated, she somehow tries to hold onto the leash of Kaelus. By smiling sweetly at him and praying hard for him.But will that solve everything? The world is so easy, right?\u201cYou\u2019re so arrogant because you still have something to rub against.\u201dEven your last crown princess seat will be in jeopardy, so you\u2019ll see. Diana.I\u2019ll let you fall to your feet. To the point where you have to kneel desperately.I\u2019ll take everything away.~~~~On a rainy day.The open terrace was full of rain. I couldn\u2019t taste anything in the soup I nibbled on.\u201cI really don\u2019t have any taste in my mouth\u2026\u201dWhen I lost my appetite, Clarice was very worried.\u201cI\u2019m worried about your health. Why don\u2019t you see the doctor?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWhat\u2019s the point of stubbornly refusing? I accepted the examination with a grain of salt.However, the doctor also tilted his head.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you\u2026\u201d\u201cThen why can\u2019t she eat as much?\u201dClarice criticized the doctor for nothing.The doctor sighed.\u201cWorry is the root of all illnesses. She\u2019s lost your appetite now, and if it continues, it\u2019ll get worse everywhere.\u201d\u201cPlease prescribe something, sir!\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s just\u2026 Master needs to come back soon\u2026\u201dI smiled faintly as I watched the conversation between the lady-in-waiting and the doctor.\u201cThe doctor is right, Clarice.\u201d\u201cMadam\u2026\u201d\u201cI need to get some shut-eye for a second. I\u2019ll feel better after I sleep.\u201dThe lady-in-waiting and the doctor looked at me pitifully.\u201cTake a good rest, madam.\u201dSoon the room was quiet.~~~~I laid sprawling on the sofa.I\u2019m definitely not starving. Even if it\u2019s a little bit, I\u2019m always eating something, but strangely, my whole body is weak.\u201cIs the pain the same as before the return\u2026?\u201dI thought it was because I gave up on my health before I returned, but what if it wasn\u2019t?Even if I took good care of myself, I\u2019m destined to get sick anyway. But didn\u2019t he say there was nothing wrong when he examined me a little while ago?\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dI laughed weakly.Since it\u2019s not really painful anywhere, as the doctor said, it must be a symptom that will disappear only when Kaelus comes home.\u201cCoffee is not good either\u2026\u201dI keep talking to myself like a lost person. It feels like the mouth is moving without going through the brain.I really feel like I need to take a nap.Thinking so, I slowly lifted myself up.Then.\u201cMadam? Are you sleeping?\u201dIt\u2019s the voice of the butler Uross. I answered, sitting up straight.\u201cNo, come on in.\u201dThe door opened quietly and Uross appeared with a slightly nervous look.\u201cYou have a visitor to see you.\u201d\u201cHmm? Didn\u2019t I announce that I\u2019m refusing visitors for a while?\u201d\u201cYes, I did, but the person who came to see you\u2026\u201dI noticed for a moment when I saw him trailing the end of his words.There is only one high-ranking official who can defy the will of the duchess.\u201cIs it Hyperion?\u201dWhen asked, the butler affirmed with a strange face.\u201cYou don\u2019t need any other explanation, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not very happy to see him, but I can\u2019t ignore him because he came through the rain. Take him here.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dSince Helios came undercover in secret, it was impossible to greet him in the drawing room.After a while, Helios appeared quietly with the butler.\u201cWelcome, Hyperion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA face that doesn\u2019t show much expression.Why did I come all the way here in such a bad weather? I tried to roll my head in a daze because I was out of energy.\u201cDid anything special happen at the border?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dThen what?Helios frowned slightly, as if my expression was quite disrespectful.\u201cThat\u2019s a sight. One might even wonder if Duchess Hestia was right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter if the screw is loose or not, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re so cold-hearted that you\u2019re so exhausted just because your husband is away for a while.\u201dWhat do you mean? What a bummer.I shook my head with excitement.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much I feel for my husband. It is deeply doubtful whether his highness, who fervently wooed his saint, is correct.\u201dI echoed what he said.Surprisingly, he smirked.\u201cThat\u2019s more like you now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s rather annoying.When you don\u2019t want to think about it, it\u2019s best to ask directly.\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\u201cI want to ask you something.\u201dI stared at Helios. He rarely averted his eyes.\u201c\u2026What you said that day\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026? \u2026!\u201dI wondered what the hell he was talking about, until the memory came to mind slowly.\u201cOh, you mean the day I told you I\u2019d quit my job as an aide?\u201dHelios nodded hesitatingly for some reason.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI laughed bitterly at the question that was finally solved.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to blame me for my disrespect, I\u2019ll take it sweetly.\u201d\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dOh, I see. Then you won\u2019t mind if I relax my posture.I leaned on the sofa and opened my mouth.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t care about my disrespect.\u201dDid you say that in front of Kael because you felt a sense of futility? You must have forgotten your past fighting with Kaelus over Diana. What about the night of the dinner, you swore you\u2019d never be greedy for Kaelus\u2019 again.Just go and pay attention to your wife is praying for someone else\u2019s husband. Don\u2019t spend time with other people\u2019s wives.I had a lot to say back to Helios, but I just kept it to myself.Honestly, right now, I don\u2019t have the energy to take it out.\u201cMy words didn\u2019t mean anything else at the time. You can take it literally.\u201d\u201cFor that matter, your condition was extraordinary.\u201dHelios seemed determined not to fall for it.What I wanted to ask just popped out without going through the brain.\u201cWhat do you think I was like?\u201dHe answered after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never seen you tremble like that before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHow can I explain that?I\u2019m not sure I can say I\u2019m confused because I don\u2019t know where my reality is right now because I\u2019m a fan from outside the book.You wouldn\u2019t believe it if I told you.I should give a reasonably convincing answer.What should I do?\u201c\u2026When a competent person loses their ability, they are as embarrassed as such.\u201dOh, yeah. This should do it.In the golden eyes that looked at me, I continued with an expressionless face.\u201cThere is a difference between what you know in your head and what you actually experience. Even if I knew in advance that my prophecies would disappear, I was afraid because it really disappeared.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201dLooking at the tapering golden eyes, I continued without stopping.\u201cYes, her highness will be the same. She must have been very confused because the healing power she thought was natural has disappeared. So, her judgment became blurred\u2026 Isn\u2019t that the case?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHelios was getting more and more \u00a0 expressionless. He didn\u2019t seem to be easily convinced.But what can I do? Even if he doesn\u2019t believe it, I have no intention of explaining it more kindly.After saying that, I shut up.Now, if you got what you want, go back.\u201c\u2026Okay. If you say so, I won\u2019t ask you any more.\u201d\u201cI thank you, your grace.\u201dI\u2019m going to answer right away.\u201cBut this time you answer honestly.\u201d\u201c?\u201dWhy are you coming on so strong?The golden eyes of Helios shone sharply.\u201cIt\u2019s strange, I guess. Your prediction is generally accurate to the point of time, but it\u2019s quite different now from when you predicted that your ability would disappear.\u201dWow, it\u2019s not easy.How could you remember that I said that I would lose my ability in about two years and doubt the time difference from the actual date of my resignation.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you honestly. Is there any prophecy you haven\u2019t told me yet?\u201dAh, you\u2019re still greedy.I wondered why you were worried about me, and as expected, there was a real purpose.I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve dealt with a situation when I don\u2019t have any energy.I should get it done quickly and let it go.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. At that time, I had a piece of prophecy that I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d accept.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dHelios glared at me as if it were ridiculous.\u201cI trusted the prophecies to be honest and made you my aide, but as expected!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll understand my judgment when you hear it. I have long known that your highnesses will be estranged almost like a stranger.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was before you two got this bad. How can I you that in such a situation?\u201d\u201cWhoo\u2026\u201dA deep sigh of anger from the male lead.I\u2019m losing my strength too. Now I have a headache. I guess it\u2019s more so because I barely ate anything.If you\u2019re done, please go. Yes?\u201cThen it means that we\u2019ll just be like strangers, and Diana will still be the crown princess, right?\u201dIt\u2019s not over yet.I stopped holding my temples because of the buzzing headache.I\u2019m choking up with annoyance. An answer that pops out again without thinking about it.\u201cOh, well, until I died, the saintess was still the crown princess.\u2026\u201d\u201c!\u201dAn instantaneous freeze of air.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAnd I realized that I made a mistake one beat later than Helios.Damn it.I\u2019m doomed.My brain stopped because I had no energy.\u201cBefore death?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.\u201dIt is actually extremely exhausting to hold on to the questioning. I\u2019ve told Kaelus once anyway, so let\u2019s just tell Helios.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve told my husband before. I think the reason I\u2019m losing my ability is probably because I\u2019m dying.\u201d\u201cKael knows?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI shrank weakly. Damn.However, Helios\u2019 eyes were filled with force.\u201cDon\u2019t lie. I told you to be honest.\u201d\u201cYour bighness, I\u2019m not lying\u2026\u201d\u201cDiana was a crown princess until \u2018before I died\u2019? Does that mean you\u2019ve already died once?\u201d\u201c!\u201dCrazy.What is it?Why are you so sharp?\u201cOh, it must be true. This is it. This is the truth, Hestia.\u201dHelios laughed in vain.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a prophecy! It was all real events. Until you died!\u201dSeriously, I can\u2019t think of anything.I should have eaten well. I should have replenished my energy earlier.Why did you make such a fatal mistake in front of a fox who never lets his guard down?Why do I have so many holes?\u201cYour Highness, to Kaelus\u2026\u201dMy voice is so unsightly that it sounds like it\u2019s crawling.\u201c\u2026 Let me tell him. I won\u2019t hide it, I\u2019ll tell him myself.\u201dThen, a fierce question comes.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not really a prophet? That you\u2019re back in the past after death?\u201d\u201cEverything, everything\u2026\u201dIf I tell myself the truth, will Kaelus be as angry as Helios?Would I be able to lie naturally if I could think?\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t apologize, Hestia! I\u2019m not angry right now!\u201d\u201c?\u201dI stiffened up and looked at Helios.Helios, who seemed to be at a loss, ruffled his black hair again and again.\u201cYou can change it, right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?\u201dHe looked back at me ferociously.\u201cYou can change it! You could\u2019ve changed some of the things you\u2019ve said so far, in your\u00a0 prophecies! Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s fifty-fifty.Kaelus\u2019 death was prevented, but Diana\u2019s loss of power was not prevented. The empire prevented the war crisis, but it did not prevent Baron Potos from sinking the merchant ship.There is a past that can be changed and a past that does not change.Which of them is my destiny.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dI said frankly.Then he gripped my arm with an angry force.\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou have to change it! If you don\u2019t know how, come up with it! What do you want me to do with Kael? The guy barely survived thanks to you\u2026!\u201dI frowned with throbbing pain.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about Kael\u2026\u201d\u201cThis\u2026!\u201dHelios tried to shout something more but stopped. Instead, he let go of my arm that he was holding in pain.\u201cThe reason you died\u2026 What was it\u2026?\u201dHis voice has softened up a lot. Helios seems a little bit genuine now.I retorted, rubbing my arm gently.\u201cI think I\u2019m sick\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t get any treatment.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dWhy is he in such a hurry to answer with an immediate question?\u201cI didn\u2019t want to live.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026?\u201dNow it\u2019s 20 questions.By the way, I think I\u2019m slowly getting out of panic. Seeing that you\u2019re coming up with useless words.I tilted my head and looked at Helios.\u201cBecause Kaelus was dead. Because of you and Diana.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI shrugged my shoulders at Helios, who had hardened.\u201cSo as soon as I returned, I saved Kaelus first. The rest is as you have seen.\u201dLaughing in vain.\u201cNow you\u2019re getting the pieces together, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLeaving him standing stunned, I dragged my feet up to the terrace.\u201cIt\u2019s not just love. My feelings for Kael.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cKael is my life itself. You can\u2019t compare it to a shallow love\u2026\u201dI bent my eyes and laughed.\u201cI think you\u2019ve got all the answers you want, your highness?\u201dThe golden eyes full of emotion headed towards me.\u201cDid you say you got sick and died?\u201d\u201cYeah, well\u2026 to be honest, I guess that\u2019s the case. I was definitely sick in the months before I died.\u201d\u201cWhen?\u201dI noticed what he wanted to ask. There was a sudden smirk of laughter.\u201cJust around this time of the year?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry. My doctor examined me this morning and said I was fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send a doctor tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhy would you? The duke\u2019s doctor is also known for his name.\u201d\u201cThe more people who do it, the more accurate it will be.\u201dHelios continued to be stubborn.It\u2019s funny to wrestle with something like this. Let\u2019s just let it happen.\u201cWhoa, do as you please.\u201dI leaned against the terrace door and replied.~~~~I stared blankly out of the terrace.Helios\u2019 carriage was leaving through the thinning rain.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dAfter an emotional ride on the roller coaster, I can\u2019t think of anything like my mind is completely empty.\u201cIt\u2019s driving me crazy.\u2026.\u201dHelios is like a fox.How can I pick up the fact that I\u2019m a regressor when I just made a mistake?It\u2019s ridiculous and I can\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cHa\u2026 but I didn\u2019t get caught being a possessor\u2026\u201dIf the conversation had been prolonged a little longer, J might have been caught as a possessor by leaking clues.Helios is a human being who will know enough.Anyway, Helios found out one of the secrets I was going to take to the grave.I don\u2019t want to make secrets between Helios and myself even if I die.Therefore, my secret to Helios must be told the same to Kaelus.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dIn fact, it\u2019s dark in front of us.Whatever the content, I\u2019m worried that I have to reveal the fact that I\u2019ve been hiding something all along the way.There is no way that it is not unpleasant. You must feel betrayed.Whatever excuse I make, it\u2019s an immovable truth that I lied to him.I murmured to myself.\u201cI lied to you that I\u2019m good at predicting things. I\u2019m actually a regressor.\u201dPractice speaking without stuttering in practice.I should either get in shape quickly before making a mistake or even refuse to visit Hyperion.I couldn\u2019t even eat a bowl of soup properly and greeted a fox-like person, so truth came out for a long time.No, but that means I\u2019m screwed.As I\u2019m certain that I\u2019ll achieve my goal, my mind has become relaxed. Even though I shouldn\u2019t relax until the end.But this doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m a prophet or a regressor. Only Diana needs to kneel down anyway.\u201dWhen your head is complicated and things get twisted, you have to go back to the beginning.What I wanted in the beginning. I thought for the heroine to desperately regret it.All of the advantages gained through the impersonation and regression are only means to this, and it means that it is not my ultimate goal to firmly hide itself.The unexpected unexpected situation has made my mind a little painful, but fundamentally, the goal I want to pursue does not disappear.It remains the same in the future as it has been.I will punish Diana and make Kaelus happy.~~~~The next day, a real imperial doctor appeared in the mansion.\u201cHis highness the crown prince sent me. He is very concerned about your health.\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026.\u201dThe duke\u2019s doctor, who was unaware of the context, looked at me with a strange expression. I shook my head still. It means you have to understand because there\u2019s nothing you can do.Eventually, the palace began to examine me as our doctor watched.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dI asked in a blunt way on behalf of our doctor, who would have been upset.\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, right?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dSee? It\u2019s the same. My doctor and I shrugged.But thanks to you, I thought of a good business. An idea that came to mind when I saw the group of doctors gathered.As more and more people doubted the purity of the temple, some of the lower ranks were also slowly leaving the temple.The most passionate and pure group are those who have just become ranked. Therefore, when they found out that the temple was pursuing the secular world more than anyone else, they began to question the direction of the temple they believed in.The main role of the new shrine is poor relief and medical practice. What I especially noticed was this medical sector.Since the imperial palace doctor is here, let\u2019s ask him.\u201cThere are quite a few courtiers from the new shrine, right?\u201d\u201cYes, some were apprenticed under the doctor of the aristocratic family, and others entered the imperial palace after practicing medicine as a retainer.\u201d\u201cHow are the courtiers from the new shrine doing?\u201dTo my question, the imperial palace doctor stretched his chest and answered with a gesture of pride.\u201cWhether they\u2019re a priest or an apprentice, once they\u2019ve entered the palace; it means they have the best ability in the empire, duchess.\u201dNext to him, the duke\u2019s doctor held back his laughter. I didn\u2019t want the answer either, but his expression was so serious that I couldn\u2019t say anything.Anyway, the palace finished its mission and returned safely to the palace.It is better to visualize the inspiration that pops into your head as soon as possible. This is because only then will it develop from the level of 'sudden thoughts\u201d to \u201cexecutable ideas.\u201dThe first thing to do is to bring in medical talents who have left the temple before their skills are rusted.I immediately called the butler and instructed him.\u201cI\u2019ll have to put up a notice in the downtown square. We need to gather people who have learned medicine. Especially those from the new shrine.\u201d\u201cAll right, ma\u2019am.\u201dUross\u2019 work is always reliable.After gathering talent in this way, a general clinic will be created to ensure that medical practice is completely separated from the temple. It is also a good idea to set up a medical school to train more skilled professional doctors.If the honor of the temple is ruined, then the function of the temple will dry up.I will peel off the package and blow out the foam. Remove everything except the kernel.\u201cNo more, let\u2019s go back to God.\u201dTime to return to the original role of the temple.I hope they will return to their original intentions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAgain, it was best to concentrate on work to forget unnecessary worries.The inspiration that came to mind on the day the courtier visited was put into practice, and in an instant, things to do snowballed.Uross followed my instructions steadily. He posted a notice on the bulletin board on the main street during the day.The story is that \u201cThe Duchess Hestia is looking for a medical talent.\u201dThe reaction was very immediate. From that night on, letters began to fly right in front of me.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dI gulped down the nutritional juice put in by the maid, Clarice.After Helios left, I decided to force myself to eat a lot even if I had no appetite.Damn it, I shouldn\u2019t be too lazy to nourish myself so that I don\u2019t get hit twice by that jerk.I experienced the fact that if I don\u2019t eat, I don\u2019t have energy, and if I don\u2019t have energy, my thoughts leak. What a nasty lesson it was.I called in the doctor and sat next to him.\u201cLet\u2019s go over the papers together, sir.\u201d\u201cYes, Duchess\u2026\u201dI heard a groan somewhere, but I decided to coolly ignore it.The people who sent the letters certainly came from the new shrine. In recent years, some people quit the shrine, and some people quit quite a long time ago and engaged in other jobs.I asked my doctor secretly.\u201cAre there any of them skilled enough to teach others?\u201d\u201cWell, some people stand out.\u201dThe reason why common people had no choice but to visit the temple even if they hated it was because there were no suitable places other than the temple where they could receive treatment at a low price.We must make sure that no one looks at the temple. In order to do so, even if you don\u2019t visit the temple, there must be no difficulty in your daily life.\u201cLet\u2019s sort out the people who can start the treatment right away.\u201d\u201cYou have to divide it into two categories. Ma\u2019am, it\u2019s better to separate those who can see you in person from those who can only assist you.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dYou should always listen to what the professional says. I immediately accepted the doctor\u2019s suggestion.Soon after, the butler was also called to my room.\u201cI need to buy a building with a lot of rooms. It should be available as a clinic.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll find out as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cOh, and look for another building. Uross. This time, a good place to be a training camp.\u201dUross took notes of my instructions and nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll pick a few suitable candidates. Why don\u2019t you choose one out of them?\u201d\u201cOkay, that\u2019s much better.\u201dHe is also a good worker, so he proceeds with what to do without me instructing him one by one.The doctor smiled softly.\u201cIt would be better for you to be busy than free.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dTo be honest, I wish I was much busier than this. One might lament that it is a disaster that was brought to you, but I want to get busier and forget the anxiety and loneliness that permeates.\u201cWell, let\u2019s read the next letter.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dThe doctor sighed and picked up the thick glasses again.~~~~Because of the huge notice on the bulletin board of the downtown area, the business within the city quickly became known in the social circles.And surprisingly, this time the temple responded.A lengthy protest before me. In summary, however, it ended in one sentence.\u201cWhat? How dare you trample on God\u2019s authority?\u201dNo, since when has medicine been a thing of the temple? So all the doctors of the aristocracy are sinners who ignore God? What about the palace?\u201cWow\u2026 I guess I\u2019m doing it right because the temple is angry. I should continue to do this. Hmph.\u201dI gritted my teeth with a snort.That arrogance will be over when the complaint comes out to the world soon. It\u2019s too late to regret after the decapitation.However, there is a reason why the temple is so sensitive. This is because after the duke\u2019s notice was hung, the young retainers of the temple began to stir.In fact, many of the letters that arrived at me were from the retainers who still belonged to the temple. In many cases, they were secretly sent away by holding them to the side of visitors to the temple, avoiding strict ministers.In fact, my notice did not promise any treatment of medical personnel.Nevertheless, this agitation can be seen as meaning that young priests are not already very attracted to the temple.Then is it all the more my fault for the departure of the young priests? It\u2019s the owner\u2019s fault for not taking care of the rabbits!\u201cYou\u2019re always busy blaming others.\u201dI clicked my tongue and threw the temple protest into the fire.~~~~Before long, the butler, Uross, held out a few documents before me.\u201cWe have distinguished between ready-to-use buildings and buildings that require some repairs, madam.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dI took a close look at the list that Uross summarized. Soon after, the doctor, who had been called in, began to pick the right place with me.\u201cThe mansion was used for residential purposes, but there are many large spaces such as banquet rooms and dining halls. If it\u2019s well-decorated, it will be a good clinic.\u201d\u201cWell, how about this one? It was used as an academy in the past, but it has been empty for several years. I think we can use it as a training center if we just fix it.\u201d\u201cOh, that would be fine, madam.\u201dWe ranked the candidates appropriately. If I failed to get a candidate that is on the priority list, I can move on to the next one.It was disadvantageous to drag on too long. Since the duke\u2019s servants had already been poking around looking for things, there was a concern that landlords would call the price high if rumors spread that they were buying buildings from the duke.I hurried to get ready to go out. And I decided to accompany the doctor because I needed more perspective from the field worker than myself, an amateur.All real estate transactions must be checked at the site before signing a contract.\u201cIt\u2019s wider than I expected. Hmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThe wider one is more useful than the narrower one. Ma\u2019am, I think it\u2019s a good idea to convert this mansion into a clinic.\u201d\u201cOkay, it\u2019s good enough to isolate the infectious disease patients.\u201dIt was decided that the mansion, which was formerly the residence of a certain family, would be reborn as a private clinic.Meanwhile, a large building, an old academy, was left empty for a long time because it could not find a suitable owner. So before I actually looked around, I was worried that it might have been too old.However, when I looked at it with my eyes, it was not as shabby as I thought.\u201cIf it is repaired, it will last long enough, madam.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not easy to find another suitable place to gather people and teach them at once.\u201dWhen I expressed my intention to purchase the building to the owner of the old academy, he quickly signed the contract without thinking twice. It seems that he has been suffering from difficulties in dealing with it.Thanks to this quick movement, we were able to successfully purchase the building without any interruptions.\u201cSir, The duchess will be busy looking at people, but please quickly create a list of picks that you need to fill in at this clinic.\u201d\u201cHahaha, leave it to me. Ma\u2019am, I\u2019m really looking forward to this business.\u201dThere is no one who will not devote themselves o a well-motivated task. Therefore, I was able to leave the details to my doctor with confidence.The establishment of the clinic was quiet and proceeded very quickly.I decided to meet the former priests who sent me the letter in person.Even if they left the temple, they could still have a devout faith. However, I decided not to set \u2018maintaining faith\u2019 as a condition of working together.What I want is proper working ability, not having the same ideas as me. In addition, to separate temple and medical practice as I aimed, I needed to be free from this problem first.\u201cMorothy, we\u2019ll have a meeting at the duchy\u2026\u201dI invited them to the duchy, replying to each of the selected letters. Although it is in the form of a group interview, it was actually not necessary to pick more out of here, so it had to be seen as a kind of meeting.\u201cWhew, as expected, we have to be quick. That way, we won\u2019t give them* time to fight back.\u201d*TN: the templeIt was too late to try to do so. I can\u2019t wait for the day the bomb explodes.So.\u201cCome back soon, Kael\u2026\u201dI was able to endure a little because I pushed myself so hard to be busy on purpose.Still, his absence is frightening and disturbing.The only reason I live in this world.I can\u2019t wait for my favorite to come back to my side.~~~~I\u2019ve filled up my day a little too much. To forget the anxiety and fear that appeared like a ghost, I had to concentrate on something.The doctor\u2019s examination was also done every morning. One thing that bothered me was sending Helios a daily report of the examination.\u201cHis Highness is quite interested in your health\u2026\u201dSince I sent him to the palace, it is natural that the doctor thinks so.\u201cPhew, he seems to want to relieve himself of what he owes Kael.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dFor the duke, Helios and Diana\u2019s marriage was a pretty complicated affair. So my doctor agreed with me without much explanation.It\u2019s about time to wrap up the examination with the opinion that there\u2019s nothing wrong today.\u201cMadam! I got a call from the border!\u201d\u201c?!\u201dThe butler, Uross, rushed in.I snatched a letter from him and opened it quickly.\u201cThe negotiations ended successfully\u2026! We\u2019re leaving soon\u2026\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dMy favorite kept the war at bay.Now all you have to do is come back safely.~~~~Kaelus\u2019 short letter really said, \u201cThe negotiations ended successfully,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re leaving soon.\u201dAnd the rest of the words that I didn\u2019t read to the servants.<I can\u2019t wait to see you.>\u201c\u2026\u201dIn the room where the doctor and the butler left me alone, I wiped away the moisture from my eyes.\u201cWhoa, I\u2019m so blessed\u2026\u201dI think I\u2019m already loved by him more than Diana.All the sweet words that were only told to Diana in the original novel are now directed at me.Not only the favorite and the heart but also the body were united. Indeed, as he wished, we are even closer to a \u2018true couple\u2019.\u201cA married couple\u2026 who spend the rest of their lives together\u2026.\u201dBut it still feels very strange to me.In the first place, I never thought I would live in this world until I got old and died. This is a novel for now, and I never recognized it as a reality where I would stay forever.However, I didn\u2019t really look for my way back. When I woke up one day, the world had changed, so I had a vague idea that it would be the same when I went back.If I can\u2019t go back to my original world anyway, I may have to make my life here somehow until then.\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019ve never thought about how to live my life in a novel\u2026\u201dI murmured with a vague feeling.The character I possessed was also an extra without presence. My identity was not more than a thoroughly fanatical reader.It was no different because it was a world where Kaelus died and didn\u2019t exist. Since the will to live had already disappeared, why would I have had to make my life there?I was just living because I couldn\u2019t die. In the meantime, I was too scared to take my own life like my favorite.What was I afraid of? The answer was simple.I\u2019m afraid the moment I die will hurt so much.The biggest concern was just how much physical pain it would be. I hesitated because I was afraid it would be painful as soon as I touched the ground if I jumped, and hesitated because I would be suffocated if I fell into the water.So I couldn\u2019t die. Funnily enough.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dIsn\u2019t it ridiculous? Even though moments of life are constantly painful, the pain you feel right away when you\u2019re about to die is the biggest obstacle.However, thanks to that, even if there is a \u201cI don\u2019t want to live,\u201d I may continue my life steadily instead of dying in anger.After living like that, I\u2019ve returned like this.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe truth is I\u2019m not confident.There is nothing more to be learned from the fanatic notes. From now on, Hestia in this novel must live with the foundation she was born with.If Kaelus liked me because of the cheat key I\u2019ve used so far.\u201c\u2026What should I do\u2026?\u201dOf course, he never told me why, but I never asked him outright.Why does he want me to be his true companion.\u201cWell, to be honest, I\u2019m a lot better than Diana\u2026 Hehe\u2026.\u201dBut with that logic, maybe there\u2019s someone else in the world better than me.Can I fit in well with Kaelus, who has done everything and has nothing anymore?Will I be accepted as a member of this world when I have not made my life affectionately* and have lived looking at everyone around me as a convenient tool to use?*TN: she didn\u2019t appreciate her lifeDo I admit to myself that it is okay to live in this works for decades more?Are I prepared to accept this place as my whole reality?\u201cUm\u2026\u201dTo be honest, I am very afraid.But it\u2019s worth the courage to do it.If I could spend my whole life receiving the love of my favorite in the world.If we can live happily with a smile without losing him again.Then this will be my new reality, and I will no longer be a common and ordinary rofan reader, but as the Duchess Hestia.\u201cPhew, but I have to tell my favorite first.\u201dThere is still one mountain to climb between Kael and me.It\u2019s about my ability and my identity that Helios had discovered. I confessed that I was not a visionary, but a regressor.It doesn\u2019t matter whether I was a visionary or a regressor.The issue of this matter is that I have lied to Kaelus from the beginning.Will Kaelus accept me like this?Will he be able to maintain his trust in someone like me?\u201cWhoa, let\u2019s talk. You won\u2019t know until you talk to him!\u201dTo know the answer,I have no choice but to pluck up the courage.~~~~I started the day with a tight schedule as usual.\u201cToday, I\u2019m going to go check how much progress has been made in repairing the building.\u201dThen Clarice, who brought the coffee, carefully spoke.\u201cBut isn\u2019t today the day master arrives in the capital?\u201d\u201cKaelus will stop by the palace first. He has to report the outcome of the negotiations to His Majesty.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dI grinned on purpose.\u201cThere\u2019s too much to do all day.\u201dI said this, but in fact, as Clarice said, my heart was about to explode after waiting for Kaelus all day long.I\u2019m relieved that he\u2019s back safely.The excitement of meeting him soon.And fear before confessing the truth to him.If I don\u2019t do anything, I\u2019ll be suffocated by all kinds of emotions.I\u2019ll try my best to be myself and be brave.Didn\u2019t I worry before Kaelus left? I mean, I\u2019m not as energetic as I usually am.Therefore, it must be clearly demonstrated that the concern was a quirk. To do this, even if it is annoying, I have no choice but to distract my nerves by doing other things.\u201cI\u2019ll be back, Clarice.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am\u2026.\u201dThe lady-in-waiting nodded reluctantly.~~~~I stayed outside until late in the afternoon.The old academy building had been empty for a long time, even though the framework was strong, so there were many old corners all over the place. The workers seemed quite nervous when I came out and checked the status of the work.I said with a smile on my face.\u201cPlease be careful not to cause any defects in the future.\u201d\u201cYes! Duchess!\u201dThe working class leader replied in a voice full of shouts.Then I headed to the mansion for the clinic. It could be used immediately if it was cleaned neatly, so the priests from the duchy were working with beads of sweat.\u201cGet plenty of rest while working, everyone.\u201d\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am!\u201dSince they are from the same family, I ask them much more gently.When I returned home after finishing all my business, I made the carriage run slowly.\u201cUgh\u2026 I\u2019m nervous\u2026\u201dAs I got closer to home, tension that tightened my heart appeared again. The urge to stay outside a little longer and go in is soaring.But no. Because Kaelus told me to wait \u2018at home\u2019 just before he left.Even if I go outside to forget the tension and anxiety, I should go back and greet Kaelus \u2018at home\u2019 in time.I finally got off at the front door of the mansion with my pounding heart.\u201cMadam!\u201dAs soon as I arrived, Uross came running like a baby.\u201cIt\u2019s time for master to arrive soon. I got a call a long time ago that he\u2019s coming home after refusing to have an imperial dinner.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dIt\u2019s supposed to be an emperor\u2019s dinner, but you don\u2019t want to! Even though Kaelus is a duke, is that okay?\u201cAnyway, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s about to\u2026\u201dBut before Uross\u2019 words were finished, loud carriage wheels were heard from outside.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI couldn\u2019t move from the spot and looked at the front door, with my pale face.The sound of the carriage, which was ringing like thunder in my ears, stopped. Then I heard the door open.The sound of shoes hitting the floor.The butler plodded along and opened the porch.\u201c\u2026\u201dI closed my eyes tightly for a moment.Then, slowly, I opened my eyes again.\u201c\u2026Hess.\u201dThe brilliant silver-haired Kaelus appeared before me like a mirage.It\u2019s a rather shabby appearance from a long trip, but it didn\u2019t hide the brilliance of my favorite.Oh, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201cDid you just arrive?\u201dIt was only then that I could smile.Kaelus rushed to meet me after completing the task given by the emperor.How could I refuse his hand?\u201cHestia.\u201dAs soon as I held his hand, a strong grip clasped my hand.Kaelus began to climb the stairs without saying a word. I was caught by him and had no choice but to follow him.We climbed completely up the corridor connecting to our rooms.\u201c!\u201dHis pace seemed to accelerate little by little, but he couldn\u2019t hold back a few steps and ran at all.The bedroom door of Kaelus opens with a roar.We ran in, holding hands.\u201c\u2026!\u2019\u201cHmm\u2026!\u201dBefore I could confirm that the door was closed, Kaelus swallowed my lips roughly.A deep nostalgic scent.A burning desire.The intense emotions that I could feel from body contact melted my whole body, which had been frozen with tension, all at once.\u201cHa, ha\u2026.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026Kael\u2026\u201dIt was not until I was out of breath that our joint lips came up for air.The red lips smiled with a captivating curve.\u201cWell, as promised.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI fell down on the bed as if I was being pushed. And a waterfall of silver covered my vision.A frank conversation of the body, with nothing to hide.It didn\u2019t matter at this moment because Kaelus, whom I had missed so much with anxiety, was holding me without washing up first.I held Kaelus\u2019 face tightly in my hands. My lips were frantically searching for his lips.I have to feel his breath right under my nose. I have to confirm with his breathing and body temperature that he has returned to me safely.\u201cHess. Hess\u2026!\u201dKaelus called me by my name and gave me his lips willingly. I jumped into it as if I were a desperate beast running for water.I hugged him, almost clinging to his arms. Unable to control my overflowing affection, I hugged him and gave him strength. Smiling, our position on the bed was reversed.Now he\u2019s lying under me. He smiled brightly.\u201cHug me.\u201dI followed him with a full smile.\u201cGladly.\u201dNo more words were needed.I lifted myself up slightly. In front of Kaelus, I pulled back my skirt and threw off my underwear myself. With my lower body exposed, I sat lightly on his thigh this time. I boldly touched his bottom. A nice belt ornament was dragged out of my hand.Only then did his penis stand up proudly.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIn ecstasy, I licked the pole from the root to the top. A faint groan escaped from somewhere.\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dThe blood vessels wound around the penis swelled up. I carefully lifted my pelvis and set it on top of it. And slowly, very slowly, I lowered myself.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dA foreign object broke into my body. A painful groan came up automatically, but I endured and swallowed.I can\u2019t allow a man who\u2019s traveled a long way to move. Now is the time for me to quench his thirst.\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dI took a breath for a moment with my hand on his chest.\u201cHess\u2026 it\u2019s okay\u2026?\u201dTo Kaelus, who was struggling to ask, I replied with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026. You stay still\u2026. I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019ll do it\u2026.\u201dAs long as my favorite is happy, I can do anything.I moved my pelvis slowly, which I swallowed up to the root. In a circle, as smooth as possible. As if embracing the loveliest thing in the world, with sincerity.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dA little exclamation broke out. I put my reason aside for a while and followed my senses for a moment in wriggling as if I were a creature of my own will. I instinctively shook my waist, so that it could touch my most sensitive spot.\u201cHa, ha\u2026!\u201dThe silver eyelashes that stretched through Cylus\u2019 closed eyes trembled.\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dMy heart was filled with indescribable joy. How sexy his expression is when he enjoys sexual harassment. This is a privilege that only I can enjoy.I leaned forward and hugged him. His heart beat directly on my chest. The sound of his truly living breathing reached my ears.Alas, I can be sure now. My favorite is really alive and well and in my arms. As promised to me.His arm gently wrapped around my back. A sighing voice.\u201cHess\u2026 I missed you\u2026\u201dI caressed his face and hair fondly. And in response to his confession, my vagina, containing the penis, tightened as much as it could. His fine eyebrows twisted in an instant.\u201cHuh\u2026!\u201dI laughed silently. This is what makes a man happy.Whenever he, who has always been neat, is disturbed little by little, a mean desire slowly blooms. After lifting my pelvis slightly, I dropped it with force.\u201cHaaaaah!Kaelus, who responded quickly. Before I knew it, I felt a tingling sensation. One more time on my ass.\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dIn a moment, a sharp electric current ran through my head. It\u2019s stuck tight. My lips opened by themselves.\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026!\u201dAlas. As much as I want, I stabbed the spear where I wanted it. An indescribable pleasure spread throughout the body. The pleasure of staying in my body for a very long time, both crumpled and relaxed.\u201cGasp, gasp, gasp\u2026!\u201dA silver-haired handsome man groaning under me.\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa\u2026!\u201dAt this moment, I have everything.I dug deep into his lips. He immediately circled my tongue. The satisfaction of owning him entirely as mine. I feel awfully good.I raised my upper body again. Then, as if he had done it to me, I hit it back with force.**TN: as in she slammed down. She didn\u2019t hit herself\u201cHa\u2026! Oh! Ah\u2026\u2026!\u201dA coy groan broke out. The sensation of a thick pillar pushing through my skin is thrilling. I am overwhelmed by the presence that fills my body. The blood is boiling. My body temperature gets hot.\u201cHa, Hess\u2026! Ahhhhhhhh!\u201dKael\u2019s hand clenched my pelvis. Strong enough to leave white fingerprints on my skin.\u201cUhhhhhhh\u2026!\u201dMy mind began to turn white. I slammed my back in a trance.A little more, a little more.\u201cHa, hah\u2026!\u201dAh! Yes, this is it!\u201cUgh! Ugh!\u201dAn unaffordable pleasure gushed from the top of the head.\u201cOh my god!\u201dThen, a tight groan came from below. At the same time, a warm energy spread inside the lower abdomen.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI crumbled over my favorite\u2019s body. I buried my face in the back of his neck and let out a short breath.A finger came through my hair.\u201cHess\u2026\u201dThe dying voice seemed exhausted. I also opened my mouth in a cracking voice.\u201cAs soon as I got here, I went too far\u2026 Let\u2019s go to the bathroom now.\u201dThen came a little laugh. His reclining upper body vibrated slightly.\u201cHa ha\u2026 That sounds very tempting\u2026?\u201dOh, no. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.I took Kaelus by the hand and pulled him up.\u201cTake off your clothes first.\u201dUntil now, we had conversations with our bodies without properly changing our clothes. Only then did I feel embarrassed. What\u2019s the rush?Kaelus smiled broadly.\u201cThat\u2019s a great suggestion, Hess.\u201dWe took off what we were wearing one by one and wrapped our tongues around each other again. Walking naturally to the bathroom.Kaelus and I had one more long talk like that.~~~~\u201cKael\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not tired\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dOutside the window was already dark. Still, the moon was shining brightly tonight.Perhaps they realized that the conversation between the couple was continuing, and the servants managed to avoid the room.I\u2019ve been out all day, but Kaelus must have been riding a carriage much longer than I did. Nevertheless, we went straight to his bedroom without any time to catch our breath.\u201cYou refused the Emperor\u2019s dinner. At least you\u2019ll be hungry.\u201dThen, purple eyes full of color bent mischievously.\u201cSo you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d\u201cNo, I mean\u2026!\u201dArgh, seriously! Why didn\u2019t you ever describe my favorite person as such a sly personality! Author!The long fingers crept through the legs again.\u201cAre you still not satisfied? Then\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, stop, Kael\u2026!\u201dI almost cried with tears in my eyes. I\u2019ll make sure you eat dinner before it\u2019s too late!Kaelus fell from me in a tasteful way, with great regret. In the meantime, I quickly picked up a gown and put it on my body. Perhaps because it was Kaelus\u2019, the end dragged on the floor.I rang the bell and called the servant, and a quick meal entered the room as if it had been prepared in advance.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hess?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m embarrassed\u2026\u201dDoesn\u2019t it mean that the owner and his wife waited until they resolved all their frustration? I just want to become the dust of the universe and disappear.Nevertheless, Kaelus smiled and laid one plate one by one on the table.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe meal after exercise is very delicious no matter what you eat. It seemed like my appetite had returned after a long time.Come to think of it.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the doctor\u2019s \u201cprescription\u201d came to mind. What he said was that I was losing my appetite so much that the only answer was for Kaelus to return.\u201c?\u201dI had no choice but to laugh at Kaelus with a mysterious expression.\u201cI\u2019ve hardly eaten in the days since you left. So I went to see the doctor, and he gave a prescription to wait for you to come back because it\u2019s a psychological cause.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe doctor is a great doctor.\u201dKaelus sighed briefly.\u201cI thought you were a little thinner than before, but it was because of me.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dAs I continued this and that conversation, I carefully read the room.How can I say it? The truth that I was actually a regressor.I think the timing is right now. It seems the most appropriate time to sit face to face naturally.But how do I bring it up?\u201cHestia?\u201d\u201cYes, yes?\u201d\u201cYou must have something to say, right?\u201dPurple eyes stared at me and asked.I was at a loss for words.\u201c\u2026\u201dI was possessed. Completely.I focused my attention on the plate as much as I could.\u201cI don\u2019t think you know, but you\u2019re not good at hiding your expressions in front of me.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dA strange sense of dismay. Still, Kaelus smiled with lowered eyes.\u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201dI also smiled with a weak face.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that\u2019s a relief.\u201dKaelus held up his cup and leaned back slowly on the sofa. The long legs are twisted, so it\u2019s really like a pictorial.\u201cNow, tell me anything. Hess. I could listen to it all night.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dStill, I\u2019m nervous, too.In this case, it is better to boldly throw the confession first. That\u2019s how you can cut down on useless thoughts.\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus waited calmly for me to hesitate. He didn\u2019t even show any expression on his face.The truth is he\u2019d be heartbroken too.Don\u2019t you think so? When the other person suddenly says he has something to say, they are nervous until the other person hears the truth.I\u2019m not the only one nervous. We both feel the same way.It was only then that my mouth dropped.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve deceived you this whole time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt may sound like a bolt from the blue, but Kaelus waited silently for my next word.So I have to do my best to respond to his sincerity.\u201cThe truth is\u2026 I didn\u2019t have the ability to predict things.\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe purple eyes grew a lot, but soon they regained their composure.\u201cHa\u2026 as expected\u2026\u201d\u201c?!\u201dWhat do you mean, as expected?Did you guessed beforehand?Rather, I was more surprised.\u201cDid you know?\u201d\u201cNot exactly. It was just a guess. I didn\u2019t think the prophecies you\u2019re talking about are real prophecies\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201dI don\u2019t even know.Then Kaelus sighed lightly.\u201cHess, a long time ago I asked you if it was logically possible to change the future. Do you remember?\u201dHis words carried me back a long way to the past.Come to think of it\u2026\u201cWas it when we just got married?\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess you remember that.\u201dYeah. I remember.I didn\u2019t understand what he said at all, but I was frightened by his philosophical and scientific questions.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t explained logically. \u201cProphecy\u201d would refer to the already set future, but is it possible to know it in advance and change it? Then that\u2019s no longer a \u201cprophecy.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dCrazy. I still don\u2019t understand.Kaelus laughed low.\u201cBut everything you said \u2018prophecy\u2019 actually happened. It was a case that definitely existed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I guess to myself, the future you know is the ability to explain at least not \u2018foresee\u2019 but something else.\u201dIt\u2019s amazing that he deduced this far in a single conversation.There is nothing lacking in my favorite.\u201cYou\u2019re right, Kaelus.\u201dThanks to my favorite, I felt much more at ease. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u201cI\u2019m not a prophet. I\u2019m just a regressor who\u2019s gone back in time.\u201d\u201cReturn..!.\u201dKnowing that I was hiding the truth from him, he waited silently for me to open my mouth.I also have no choice but to live for my favorite.\u201cI died in the temple and woke up again and found myself back in the past. As soon as I woke up, I ran straight here. I had to save you.\u201d\u201cThen was that the day you returned?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKaelus\u2019 face with indescribably complex emotions.Are you imagining how I felt as soon as I came back to the past?\u201cI\u2019m sorry I lied to you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Hestia. There must have been a good reason.\u201dHe answered calmly.It made me laugh. Why was I so frightened this whole time?\u201cAren\u2019t you angry?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that you saved the empire with the future you knew in advance. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a prophet or a regressor.\u201dKaelus came close to me and sat down. Naturally, I looked up at him.\u201cBut I\u2019ve been fooling you all along?\u201dThe long white fingers gently caressed my face.\u201cI don\u2019t have to be angry because I understand.\u201d\u201cI was really worried\u2026\u201dThis is all because Helios made a fuss in front of me. His reaction was so intense that I was afraid that even Kaelus would do the same.The more I think about it, the more unlucky I am.\u201cHestia, if I\u2019m that angry at you, I\u2019m a very petty human being.\u201dNow his thumb gently touched my lips.\u201cTrust me, Hess. I wish you would rely on me.\u201dOnce again, I can feel the breath of fascination.To the point where I can\u2019t breathe.\u201cTo be honest, Hestia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSometimes I\u2019m surprised by myself. I want everything about you. Body and mind.\u201dKaelus\u2019 smile was so giddy.\u201cOnce I had the urge, it was hard to control myself.\u201dI laughed out loud.\u201cKael, you already have everything.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dHis hand rested on my shoulder. I\u2019m a little tired. If I don\u2019t refuse, I\u2019ll naturally be pushed down.The purple eyes looking down at me from above took on a strange glow.\u201cIt\u2019s still not enough.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026!\u201dA heavy sense of the whole body.I think the long night will continue again.~~~~The next morning.In the end, I failed perfectly to return to my room. I opened my eyes from Kaelus\u2019 bed, and I was immediately examined by my doctor.The doctor carefully finished his morning checkup. But that\u2019s enough of that!\u201cBy the way, since master is back, you don\u2019t have to report it to the palace, do you?\u201dMy mind went blank.\u201cSir, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to report to the palace?\u201dMy favorite voice sharpened at once.I slapped my head and my doctor looked puzzled.\u201cWhat? Yes\u2026 Your Highness has ordered\u2026\u201d\u201cHestia.\u201dAs soon as the doctor finished speaking, a hard voice rang in my ear.Oh, damn it.\u201cI need some explanation. Is there anything else you\u2019re hiding from me?\u201dWhat? Kael, you said you wouldn\u2019t get mad about this.I\u2019d like to plead, but first of all, I\u2019ll have to explain it quickly before he misunderstands more.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it, sir. Let\u2019s go back for now.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am\u2026.\u201dThe doctor retreated nervously, wondering if he had made a mistake.Kaelus opened his eyes and folded his arms.Shoulders that shriveled up.\u201cI was actually caught by the Crown Prince. That I\u2019m a regressor\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dI bowed my head.\u201cWhen you weren\u2019t there, he came as Hyperion once. I made a slip of the tongue after exchanging a few words with him\u2026\u201d\u201cHeli was here?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dI\u2019m in trouble. I think he\u2019s really mad.Kaelus rose from his seat, creating cool air.\u201cWhat should I report to him? Can I tell him that you\u2019re perfectly fine?\u201d\u201cHuh? Are you going to the palace yourself?\u201dAnxiety followed me to my feet.\u201cWhy, can\u2019t anyone go?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dKaelus picked up his coat on the wall with a bang.\u201cI\u2019ll be back, so you can rest at home.\u201d\u201cWell, but I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do today, so taking a rest is a little\u2026\u201dThen he jerked back at me.\u201cHess.\u201dI had no idea what was going on.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stay home.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 Yes.\u201dWow. Did Kaelus just get mad at me? You\u2019re angry, right?The butler was surprised when he prepared the carriage.\u201cAre you leaving already?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201dWithout answering the butler\u2019s question, Kaelus left with a cold wind.\u201cMadam\u2026\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s just say the facts.\u201cHe found out that Hyperion came and went.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dFortunately, Uross was quickly convinced.It seems that there is a separate button that raises Kaelus\u2019 anger. From now on, I\u2019ll have to avoid it carefully.~~~~On this day, I sat down with the doctor to discuss the opening of the clinic. It was because there was a lot of work to be done over the upcoming meeting with former retainers.But his worries were elsewhere.\u201cMadam, I didn\u2019t make a mistake this morning, did I?\u201dNo, that\u2019s not it. I made a big mistake.But I couldn\u2019t upset him, so I decided to answer him in moderation.\u201cI guess it was strange that the crown prince cared about my health, too\u201d\u201cBut why did he look so angry\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIf you know, just be quiet, doctor.\u201cWe\u2019d better work hard. Don\u2019t upset him for no reason.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dLet\u2019s save ourselves before the fire breaks out. We agreed implicitly and then went back to work.It was almost lunchtime when Kaelus returned.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dI sighed for a long time and carefully watched the incoming favorite.\u201cYou\u2019re back\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dKaelus said, leaving his coat to the butler.\u201cYou\u2019re not eating yet, are you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019ll see you at the dining hall a little later.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dWell, I think he\u2019s less angry.~~~~I sat down at the table with a sneaking tension. Soon Kaelus also appeared in comfortable indoor clothes.Servants moved away so that we could have a quiet conversation.\u201cThat is.. How are you doing?\u201d\u201cWell, what do you think we talked about?\u201dKaelus looked straight at me with purple eyes.\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I just \u2018reported\u2019 the doctor\u2019s diagnosis.\u201d\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s it? The crown prince didn\u2019t say anything weird?\u201dI can feel the strength in his eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s that weird thing you\u2019re thinking of?\u201d\u201cOh, I mean\u2026 About my return\u2026.\u201dWhy am I cringing? I didn\u2019t commit a crime.Kaelus drew a glimmer of glare.\u201cCome to think of it, you said it before. I\u2019m guessing death is the reason for the loss of prophecy.\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\u201cBut the truth is that the future after that is unknown because you had died at some point.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dOnce again, I\u2019m truly glad I didn\u2019t even get caught being an possessor.If that\u2019s even caught, alas. The mere thought of it makes me dizzy.\u201cHeli was very worried that you wouldn\u2019t change the future.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be able to change it. I collapsed because I was sick then, so I just have to take care of my health so that I don\u2019t get sick.\u201dFor now, I only fave an answer on the surface of \u201creturner.\u201dBut in fact, there is a fundamental inner problem of possessing. This is something you have to solve by taking time to think about your identity.Anyway, Kaelus readily accepted my answer.\u201cThat\u2019s why he wants to get a report from the doctor every morning.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI had a headache, closed my eyes and pressed my hands around my temple.\u201cWill you be able to do it well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI replied casually, but he looked up again at me and I flinched again.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll stay put.\u201d\u201cYou have a very natural talent for really, inadvertently scratching my stomach.*\u201d*TN: worrying himFrom the rare long-worded retort, I think he\u2019s really upset.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should thank Heli for worrying about you, or if I should be angry.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s just be thankful\u2026.\u201dI rolled my eyes and said. It seems that Kaelus\u2019 expression is ridiculous.But I have something to say, too.\u201cI was jealous, too. The crown princess even held a large prayer meeting at the Lily Palace for your safe return, but I was grateful.\u201d\u201cHa, did Diana do that?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard a lot about it. But thanks to her, you came back safely, so that\u2019s enough for me.\u201dKaelus threw down the tableware.\u201cWhile I was away from the capital for a while, all sorts of things happened.\u201dWould it be better to talk about all the social issues about Diana? He\u2019s going to open a complaint against the temple soon, so I think it\u2019s better.\u201cEven so, the social atmosphere is very unusual these days. I don\u2019t think the question of the crown princess\u2019 qualifications will end at just word of mouth.\u201d\u201c?\u201dKaelus\u2019 eyes seemed to keep saying the next thing.\u201cAccording to Countess Erinnis, some nobles are discussing the abdication of the crown princess behind the scenes.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHis eyebrows were raised.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really going to happen. The emperor still firmly supports her.\u201d\u201cEven so, if the pressure of the nobles increases, they will be shaken. If they refuse to hold a cabinet meeting to make their case, there\u2019s no difference.\u201dIndeed, if aristocrats boycott as a group, the emperor will have no choice. It is true that the imperial power is still weak to wield independent power like a tyrant.\u201cOnce the indictment is made public, the discussion of the abdication of the crown princess will come to the surface.\u201dAfter speaking calmly, I asked quietly.\u201cWhat do you think? When the nobles ask you to speak your mind\u2026\u2026.\u201dKaelus replied without hesitation.\u201cI have nothing to say, exactly. Isn\u2019t it right for the parties to decide the matter between the crown prince and his wife?\u201dOf course, his answer is very standard. But to step back like that.\u201cBut you have to think about your position. Silence may be considered rather a sign of approval for the abdication.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, Hestia.\u201dKaelus\u2019s gaze turned to me with a serious light.\u201cSeriously, I\u2019m not interested in that matter. All I want is for them not to get in between me and you.\u201dHis tone was very determined.I smiled to reassure him.\u201cThere\u2019s no way there will be a gap between us. No matter how hard they try to shake it from the\u00a0 outside, you don\u2019t have to worry as long as you and I are in balance.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true, Hestia.\u201dHe sighed quietly.\u201cBut it\u2019s true that it\u2019s unpleasant. We\u2019re busy just focusing on living happily among ourselves, and it\u2019s getting on my nerves.\u201d\u201cAnyway, the abdication of the crown princess is not just a matter of family within the royal family. You\u2019d better organize your position in advance, too.\u201dWhether you\u2019re on the side of the emperor as you\u2019ve always been, or you\u2019re on the side of the aristocracy, speaking for them.Or be neutral, as Kaelus believes.\u201cOne thing is for sure, the fight shouldn\u2019t be prolonged, Kael.\u201dWasn\u2019t it the peace he gained by removing the Duke Orcus family despite Diana\u2019s lashing out.Frankly, it\u2019s a problem if Diana stays as a crown princess, and it\u2019s a bigger problem if she\u2019s deposed. After being deposed, there will be a division among the nobles to occupy the vacancy.War is inevitable anyway. But it will be possible to shorten the period.He has stabilized imperial politics with all his honor and political fate on the line, and it is a pity that the stability is collapsing so quickly.I hope, if I can, that none of what Kaelus has achieved will be damaged.\u201cHess.\u201d\u201cYes, Kael.\u201dHe looked at me for a long time and then spoke slowly.\u201cA cabinet meeting will be held soon. I\u2019ll report mainly on the outcome of negotiations with the kingdom, but\u2026\u201dHis words slowly made my heart beat.\u201cThen\u2026?\u201dLooking into my eyes, he grinned.\u201cYes, Hestia. I\u2019m going to read your indictment in front of the crown prince and the nobles.\u201d\u201c!\u201dFinally throwing the last bomb.A weapon that would fatally injure Diana and the temple that Helios failed to stop twice.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMy heart began to tremble.Kaelus, who was willing to sacrifice memories for me.The pretty past made with friends will soon be dyed dark with his own hands.\u201c\u2026Thank you, Kaelus.\u201dI owe him a lot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe first cabinet meeting since returning from the border.Today, I decided to head to the palace with Kaelus. Quietly enter the conference room, to cheer him up close.In addition, this time the emperor also appears at the state council meeting. Holding the hand of Crown Princess Diana, whose position is in danger.On the other hand, he seems to have decided to save his daughter-in-law, but it\u2019s a pity. Today, Kaelus is due to file a complaint against the temple.My heart was pounding with anticipation to see Diana and Helios collapsing in front of my eyes.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dKaelus, who grew up nicely, was truly wonderful. A dark gray suit with colorful silver hair and a calm and intelligent atmosphere.If there\u2019s only one thing that sticks out.\u201cAre you going to use that kravat again?\u201d\u201cThis is needed.\u201dThe fact that he is not willing to give up the kravat that I made by reforming my scarf.If I knew this would happen, I would have made it less noticeable. If I had to express it, it\u2019s like he wrapped his whole body around a luxurious luxury brand, but it feels like there is a cheap thing hanging only on his neck.However, it should be fortunate that the material of kravat had a subtle luster, and that the disaster that looked like a bathroom towel was avoided*.*TN: what she was originally planning on giving him\u201cAre you ready?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dStill, it is a pity that I could not take away that kravat.The indictment was prepared to match the number of people attending the cabinet meeting. That work alone took a few days.It\u2019s a huge amount, but if this can make the temple and the crown prince kneel completely, wouldn\u2019t it be worse for them?Copies of the complaint were placed in several solid boxes. The copy would not be distributed in advance, but Kaelus will enter the state council to finish the negotiation report, and then the court servants will distribute one copy to each of\u00a0 the participants at the time of change of subject.It was Kaelus who would read the document himself, but I am more nervous.\u201cHestia, you\u2019re very nervous.\u201dHe held my cold hand warmly.I had no choice but to admit it.\u201cI guess it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been preparing for this for a long time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make sure your efforts are not wasted, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do well. Kaelus. I\u2019m just sorry. I let you do what I should have done.\u201dKael pressed his lips lightly on my forehead.\u201cIt\u2019s because of Helios\u2019 trick. After all, he allowed me to negotiate with the kingdom as a duke.\u201dAnd I got my hands on Attica.Technically, it\u2019s not a big loss. Still, it is very painful for me to borrow the hands of Kaelus.If I had been more careful, I could have handled it neatly on my own.I made a mistake when writing a memorandum with Helios, so no matter how well I look at it, it was my mistake anyway.\u201cThe accusation you made is perfect. Today\u2019s victory is all your credit.\u201dI don\u2019t agree with him.Today\u2019s victory was entirely up to Kaelus. If he hadn\u2019t given it to me, I wouldn\u2019t have actually been able to file a complaint.\u201cI rather think you have the credit.\u201dI raised his hand that was holding mine. I kissed it with respect and affection.And eye contact.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn time, it was only natural for our lips to touch each other\u2019s.~~~~I lowered the thick veil, mingled among the nobles, and quietly entered the cabinet.Kaelus headed for the seat of the Imperial Duke, right next to the emperor. He was courteously greeted by everyone there.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dI took a big deep breath.A space where the nation\u2019s ambassadors travel to. The unique solemnity and rigid air permeates the lungs.After all the ministers of state entered, the minister shouted.\u201cHis majesty and the crown prince are entering!\u201dThe emperor walked in slowly with his hand on Diana\u2019s arm. Helios, the crown prince followed suit alone.Diana settled right behind the emperor, closest to Kaelus sitting next to him.Helios sits next to the emperor on the other side. His face is not immediately visible from Kaelus\u2019 position.With the advent of the emperor\u2019s family, the atmosphere that was briefly disorganized soon subsided calmly.\u201cDuke Kaelus. I congratulate you for successfully negotiating with the kingdom. The empire that was on the verge of war was able to overcome the crisis well thanks to you.\u201dThe emperor was the first to notice Kaelus.\u201cThank you, your majesty.\u201dHe rose from his seat and took hold of a report that summarized the results of the negotiations.\u201cFor the past year or so, the kingdom has consistently collected information for imperial aggression, including spying on the defense of its borders under the guise of bandits.\u201dThe hall was silent as if it were holding its breath. Only the calm voice of my favorite rang through the conference room.\u201cRecently, we have even increased our troops on the pretext of a bandit sweep on the border. His highness considered it a major military provocation against the empire.\u201dTo be exact, it was discovered and pointed out by Kaelus, not Helios.As soon as Kaelus overcame his panic disorder and returned to politics, he reminded Helios of border anomalies.\u201cAfter detecting suspicious movements in the kingdom, we immediately started working to stop them. As a result, we were able to set the stage for negotiations before the armed conflict became a reality.\u201dState ministers flapped through the report before them to confirm the details.The remarks continued.\u201cWhat the kingdom ultimately wanted was to enter the empire and leak our wealth to the kingdom. So while I allowed the kingdom to enter on business, I required, in accordance with the laws of the empire, that they borrow more than a percentage of the business funds from banks within the Empire.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dThere was a little exclamation here and there. They seemed to be impressed by his exquisite scheme.\u201cIf the conditions are rejected and the military provocation continues, the empire also decided to march across the border immediately after the negotiations break down.\u201dThe kingdom must have been horrified. A large army had gathered at the border, which was no different than usual.A thoroughly prepared diplomatic negotiation. And Kaelus, the best politician and resourceful man in the empire.With this combination, it will be much more difficult to fail than to succeed.\u201cThe kingdom accepted the terms of the empire. So we agreed to allow the merchants of the kingdom to enter the empire, but to make sure that more than half of the capital is filled with imperial capital.\u201dThe boldness of setting up a negotiating table outside the imperial borders also had a significant impact on pressuring the kingdom. From the point of view of the kingdom, it was reasonable to assume that Kaelus, the imperial duke, did not hesitate to come out of the border because he hid another weapon.**TN: saying he wasn\u2019t afraid to leave the border because he had another trick up his sleeveAt the end of Kaelus\u2019 report, the ministers of state applauded in unison. It was a compliment to the best resourceful man who returned after safely finishing his heavy duty.The emperor also clapped his hands with satisfaction.\u201cIt\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve given you such a heavy burden. Good work, Duke Kaelus.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your majesty.\u201dHis expression was cold all the time, completely unexcited.Soon the applause died down, and Kaelus spoke again.\u201cAnd here, before his majesty and the empire, I have one more thing to say.\u201dI held my breath still.It finally explodes.\u201c?\u201d\u201c?\u201dThe imperial court servants moved quickly and laid down copies of the accusations before the ministers of state. Thick files were soon placed in front of the emperor and the crown prince.The emperor and Helios picked up the document with a mysterious face.\u201c!\u201dHelios\u2019 face, which confirmed the information of the document, turned pale at once.\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dI smiled with satisfaction behind the veil.Even if you were lucky enough to stop it once, you wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it twice. You never would\u2019ve imagined that Kaelus would have brought a complaint himself.\u201cLook, Diana.\u201dAlas. My heart beats so hard that I can\u2019t breathe.Kaelus\u2019 voice rang calmly in the rather tumultuous conference hall.\u201cI would like to make a public accusation today before the Empire and His Majesty about another scandal that has been criticized for its pursuit of worldly interests today.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201c!\u201dPeople who are appalled.I raised my eyes gently and looked at Diana.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe big blue eyes were shaking violently.Her eyes remained on Kaelus in front of her, and did not fall.\u201cI demand that the accounting books and the list of properties of the temple be made public to his majesty and the people of the empire.\u201dWhat do you think, Diana?How do you feel about the dagger being stuck in you by the hands of the same man you\u2019re desperate to get back?\u201cLook at the present reality, that those who act in accordance with the will of the noble God, do not obey it properly and fulfill self-interest.\u201dHow long did you think Kaelus would miss you?How much more time will it take to get out of your boring past?\u201cThere is evidence in this complaint that the priests have divided what they have and used their sacred wealth in the presence of God, only to raise their stomachs.\u201dHelios, you\u2019ll have to work hard to protect Diana.If you don\u2019t have any more affection for her, now is the time to make a bold decision.Will he give up and save the royal family from the mud?Or will he hold her hand until the end and crash with her.Whenever the dry voice of Kaelus rang in the conference hall, the emperor\u2019s expression grew stiffened.After that, Diana looked even more pitiful. A pale complexion.Helios kept his lips tight, as if trying to control his embarrassment.Serious eyes of the ministers of state, who began to buzz, moved back and forth between each other and passed by Diana once in a while.The indictment was strictly a denunciation of the misconduct of the temple. But even a passing child would know. In this country today, the temple was a symbol of the Crown Princess Diana.Kaelus finished reading the complaint, keeping a cool look on his face throughout.\u201cTaking care of the empire\u2019s internal troubles was also considered loyal to the empire and its emperor. Please confirm to the temple that there is no sanctuary in this country that is beyond your majesty\u2019s control.\u201dThe eyes of the nobles suddenly focused on the emperor and Diana in the back seat.\u201cKaelus, Duke of the Empire, pleads like this.\u201dKaelus sat down again after reading the long complaint.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI felt weak as if I had read the long document myself.At the same time, I admired him again. How can my favorite person stay calm and calm until the end without shaking his voice?Diana\u2019s gaze was fixed entirely near the back of Kaelus\u2019 head. Thanks to him, she didn\u2019t seem to notice that the attention in the hall was focused on her.It\u2019s a waste of the title crown princess because she\u2019s so flustered. I thought she got used to controlling her facial expressions.Soon there was a dead silence in the conference room. Everyone looked at the emperor\u2019s mouth and watched what would come out of him.After a long time.\u201c\u2026the contents of this complaint\u2026\u201dThe emperor finally spoke.\u201cIs everything true, Duke Kaelus?\u201d\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201dKaelus answered immediately without a trace of agitation.\u201cAs it says in this document\u2026 The poor suffered from the plague for a long time because they didn\u2019t get the temple\u2019s treatment on time?\u201d\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d\u201cCertainly, compared to the situation in Illion that you are taking care of, the situation in this capital is\u2026\u201d\u201cYour majesty, Illion recognized the temple\u2019s negligence early on, supplied the soap, and maintained the sewer system. Thanks to that, the number of infectious diseases has decreased significantly even during the rainy season of summer.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy conclusion is that, the temple is far from capable of fulfilling the role given to them alone after all. In addition to the temple\u2019s original role in serving and performing rituals, it is right to let the authorities supervise the relief work and medical practices that are entirely entrusted to it.\u201dThe subject of the complaint was very clear. That there was no sacred realm in what a person does.Perhaps this proposition was firmly engraved in everyone\u2019s head who listened to Kaelus today.After a low sigh, the emperor nodded slowly.\u201cI understand the Duke Kaelus\u2019 loyalty to the empire and the imperial family. I will certainly respond to your accusation as soon as possible. I\u2019m a little tired today.\u201dHe slowly lifted himself up on the armrest of the chair. Diana, who had been absent-minded, rushed to the emperor and helped him.The emperor left the meeting at a very slow pace.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd only Helios was left.The meeting ended with the Emperor\u2019s departure, but he still could not leave and approached Kaelus.\u201cThe duke.\u201d\u201cYour highness the crown prince.\u201dThe flaming golden eyes glared at the calmly sunken ones.\u201cI need to talk to you for a second.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but my wife is waiting\u2026.\u201dWhile Kaelus replied, I walked up behind him with a pompous gait.\u201c\u2026!\u201dHelios distorted his face as soon as he noticed me.\u201cWas it you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t break my promise with you.\u201dI smiled deeply.\u201cYour highness played me with a loophole, and I also fought back with a loophole.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026!\u201dHelios was about to burst in anger, but he managed to endure it when he confirmed that there were still many people around him.\u201c\u2026both of you come to my office. Right now.\u201dKaelus and I looked at each other for a moment and nodded right away.\u201cWe\u2019ll follow you soon, your highness.\u201dDo you think we\u2019ll be afraid of that?~~~~\u201cI thought you were very concerned about the royal authority!\u201dHelios then vented his pent-up anger.\u201cI\u2019m accusing the temple because I respect the royal family, your highness.\u201dKaelus also responded coldly without losing.I added a few words, too.\u201cThe highest authority in the palace is the crown princess, and then the his majesty the emperor.\u201d\u201cHestia!\u201dWhen Helios burst out, Kaelus\u2019 expression also became fierce.\u201cIf you have something to say, tell me, Helios!\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, yeah. Good!\u201dOh, it\u2019s a mess. They\u2019re not using any honorifics.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t twist your neck* like this, Diana is already in danger!\u201d*TN: go out of his way to accuse her\u201cIt seemed very comfortable for something like that, didn\u2019t it? Even though the imperial family has owed a huge debt, there is not a single shade on their face.*\u201d*TN: there are no repercussions for the imperial family after Diana\u2019s debt\u201cIn the end, what do you want, Kael? The abdication of Diana? Being blamed for the loss of face to the imperial family?\u201d\u201cCool your head. It was the temple, not the royal family, that I condemned, Heli.\u201dDuring the quarrel, I glanced leisurely around the office. Is there anything to drink?\u201cYou knew I had a deal with Hestia! And yet you\u2019re backstabbing me like this!\u201d\u201cYou are the one who has caught Hess with a cheap trap. Did you think I, her husband, would just watch?\u201dOops. I can hear you. I\u2019m not good at making tea, but would it be worth a drink if I made this much?\u201cI\u2019m going crazy because things haven\u2019t worked out yet, and you\u2019re the one who put an extra load on me!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s politics that doesn\u2019t work out, and who are you blaming for the twisted relationship between you and Diana?\u201dUgh, I can\u2019t drink. It\u2019s the tea leaves that the crown prince drinks, so the quality should be good, but I can\u2019t.\u201cWait a minute, Heli.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Kael?\u201dKaelus, who was in a fight, suddenly snatched my teapot.\u201cJust do this.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dI laughed awkwardly.\u201cThank you, Kael.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t force yourself to drink, and if it doesn\u2019t suit your taste, just throw it away.\u201dHelios laughed in vain.\u201cShall I get you some coffee?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to treat her, Heli.\u201dKaelus also responded coldly.Anyway, the heated air cooled down because my favorite suddenly poured me the tea.\u201cDidn\u2019t the temple take a step back from Diana anyway? I heard they asked the royal family to repay their loan.\u201d\u201cI did draw a line with the temple first. But public perception hasn\u2019t changed yet.\u201dHelios is right about this. The world is still looking at the temple and Diana on the same line.It can\u2019t be helped because Diana has such a strong presence as a \u201cgoddess.\u201dIt would have been better if she had abandoned the 'saint lady\u201d sooner and changed to \u201ccrown princess\u201d. However, neither of them could be put down, and she was forced to hold them all at once, and eventually had to pay the price.\u201cHey, Hestia.\u201d\u201cHeli\u2026!\u201dAt once, my favorite\u2019s voice became sharp.However, Helios\u2019 tone has softened.\u201cWait. I really want to ask her something.\u201dI looked at Helios with a teacup.\u201cSay it, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cWhat is the result that you really want? And if I give you the result, will you stop the attack?\u201d\u201cWhat I want\u2026.\u201dI laid the glass still on the table. Then, I looked at Helios again.\u201cShe hasn\u2019t apologized yet.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe two men were silent at the same time.I giggled.\u201cMy move was extremely consistent. In fact, the answer is simple.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI narrowed my eyes and laughed.\u201cAnd yet, do you know what it means for the wise Your Highness Helios to continue to want to confirm this?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dI tilted my head slightly, looking at the shaky golden eyes.\u201cYou want to avoid it. You don\u2019t want to\u00a0 apologize, you don\u2019t want to pay for it, you just want us to move on, right?\u201dCommon excuse for perpetrators who bullied someone. \u2018It\u2019s all in the past. What are you going to do about it?\u2019From Helios or Diana, there\u2019s no way I don\u2019t know what I really want. Isn\u2019t it extremely simple, which can be inferred quickly with a little thought?Nevertheless, the reason why he\u2019s asking is.\u201cDo you want to argue that this is enough, and that it\u2019s enough because it\u2019s been so painful?\u2019\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHelios could not immediately refute.Is it enough? No. Never.They did not experience a tenth of the despair that Kaelus felt. You didn\u2019t suffer enough to put death into practice.I grinned.\u201cWhen it comes time to sit down and argue with our couple, I\u2019d think about how to deal with this mess first.\u201dWhen the problem seems complicated, simplifying it as much as possible is a shortcut to finding clues quickly.\u201cYour highness has only one thing to focus on. The fact that this accusation is not directed at the imperial family, but at the temple.\u201dI don\u2019t mind giving this much advice to poor Helios.Leaving him alone in thought, I left there holding my favorite\u2019s hand in hand.~~~~As soon as Kaelus and I returned from the imperial palace and relaxed, we climbed onto the bed.There was no energy to roll around in each other\u2019s arms, so we glued our eyes together for a long time.Surprisingly, the accusations at the cabinet meeting turned the whole capital upside down than less than that evening.After a long sleep, we finally came to our senses in the twilight.\u201cOh, my God\u2026 \u2026while I was asleep, I got this many calls?\u201dI was fed up with the pile of letters that my butler Uross had spilled. Seeing that Kaelus can\u2019t say anything, he seems to be surprised too.The butler replied with an embarrassed look.\u201cThere were quite a few visitors. I sent them all back, but\u2026\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI picked up Erinnis\u2019 letter first and read it quickly.\u201cI think a copy of the complaint distributed at the state council is already circulating.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I expected, Hess.\u201dKaelus said in a casual way.\u201cNot everyone who sees the accusation will agree. But it\u2019s enough for the mainstream to agree and become the trend.\u201d\u201cHuhu, I think the trend is already down.\u201dIt had been a long time since I made a public opinion against the crown princess and the temple. Madam Harmonia also steadily gathered public opinion that the temple\u2019s accounting books should be disclosed at her salon before leaving for Attica\u2019s estate.In particular, Erinnis was a person who joined hands with me and even made a joint board. She\u2019s been waiting for the day when the accusations would break out.\u201cI asked the emperor to release the list of the temple\u2019s property in front of him, so what\u2019s left is his decision.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the emperor rejects the demands of the complaint. The people will take their support for the temple away.\u201dSupport for Diana, who was in the same boat with the temple.And this is the ultimate purpose of the accusation, which I ultimately want.Despair and loneliness when everyone who supported him turned their back.The things that have been done with faith so far have become pieces of paper without any value.I hope that Diana will experience this feeling. I hope for her to despair and weep just like Kaelus.Only then will she be able to sympathize with a little bit of Kaelus\u2019s heart, which she brutally abandoned.Stuck in the notion of morality and justice, she lost her affection and respect for people.This will be the definition of the existence of Diana, which she will carry to the end.~~~~Kaelus took some time off from the emperor. It was a reward for going a long way for diplomatic negotiations.Seeing Kaelus taking a leisurely walk in the garden, I can\u2019t think of him being confined to his room at the time of our marriage.\u201cPhew\u2026 Kael must be happy. Because he\u2019s free\u2026.\u201dI sighed deeply at the accumulated work.We have publicly accused the temple, so we must absorb those who leave as soon as possible.The day was drawing to a close when I decided to invite the priests to work at the duchy\u2019s clinic. It was something I had been planning since Kaelus went to the border, so I wouldn\u2019t struggle on my own.While Kaelus was taking a walk in the garden and taking a break from back-to-back reading, I diligently prepared to greet guests with the doctor and butler.The doctor shook his head.\u201cThere are a lot of people, so there are a lot of things to worry about, madam.\u201d\u201cHa ha, you can just focus on what kind of lectures you\u2019re giving to the guests.\u201dWe can\u2019t just feed the doctors who were former priests. I decided to give my time to the duke\u2019s doctor, who was known by name.The doctor seemed to have a lot of stories accumulated so far. However, I asked him to show the contents of his lecture in advance so that it would not be a \u2018in the old days\u2019 speech.The division of work was clear. The butler was thoroughly responsible for the meals, and the doctor and I focused on filling the meeting.While I was working for so long, Kaelus snuck in.\u201cYou look busy.\u201d\u201cOh, Kael!\u201dNo matter how busy I am, it can\u2019t be more important than my favorite.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Come on in.\u201dThe table that was littered with papers that were quickly pushed aside.\u201cI have nothing to offer but coffee right away. What do I do?\u201dTo me who was sorry, Kaelus smiled affectionately.\u201cI like coffee quite a bit, too, Hess.\u201dHow can you be so considerate with every word you say? Is it the cold and dry Kaelus that was in our early stages of marriage?But that cold favorite was also really charming.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about something again.\u201dI stopped laughing.\u201cI guess I\u2019m not good at hiding my facial expressions.\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dKaelus snorted lightly as he touched his cup of coffee to his lips.I\u2019ve been caught, so I better be honest.\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet now, but I thought you were cool when you were cold too.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHe wrinkled his brows.\u201cActually, that\u2019s what I liked the first time. Of course, I\u2019m still happy, but you don\u2019t have to erase it.\u201dI remember well how he was infinitely affectionate to Diana.So when he treated me in a rather cold manner, I was rather relieved.Because that was the essence of the character Kaelus. I was grateful that I could see his unadorned true self.If Kaelus was holding back his true nature like when he used to love Diana.It would be very sad for me to love him unconditionally.\u201cHess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKaelus put down his glass with a look of much thought.\u201cI didn\u2019t force myself to hide my emotional state from you then and now. You were always the same even when I was in the cold, and you\u2019re still the same.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t feel nervous about me showing a different attitude. I will always try to be honest with you.\u201dA careful choice of words. My heart fluttered at the careful words that took into account my feelings.As expected, he\u2019s really sweet.\u201cThank you, Kael.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dThe purple eyes that bend gently are very warm.~~~~When the whole capital was infested with temple charges, the duchy was finally visited by former priests.Because of the temple\u2019s lifestyle, which emphasizes integrity, it was impossible for guests to have suits suitable for the aristocratic dinner. So I deliberately told them there wasn\u2019t a dress code beforehand, and to come in comfortable clothes.Still, since I am a host, too comfortable clothes could seem negligent in treating guests. Therefore, it is not a fancy dress, but it is decorated with a few ornaments added to the usual outdoor clothes.Kaelus also wore a light suit. After getting ready, he decided to enjoy reading in his study before dinner time.I stood on the porch, greeted one after another the arriving ex-priests.\u201cEveryone came well. Follow me and you\u2019ll find the dining hall.\u201dOf course they were thrilled, too.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that the noble duchess is coming out in person\u2026!\u201dInstead, they were young people who rarely received such hospitality unless they were bureaucrats. They headed to the dining room one by one with a slightly flushed face.After a while, all the guests who received the invitation arrived. Kaelus and the duchy\u2019s doctor also entered the dinner room.\u201cIt\u2019s Lord Kaelus\u2026!\u201d\u201cDuke!\u201dAlthough they did not use accurate aristocratic manners, they each rose to greet Kaelus in the most polite manner they knew.\u201cToday\u2019s dinner is hosted by my wife, so if you have something to honor, go to her.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke Kaelus!\u201dThe meal began in an amicable atmosphere.Large dishes containing food flew onto the long table one after another. The servants diligently went around the table and filled the empty glasses with wine.\u201cThe lives of the people of the capital are on your hands. You all know how sad it is not to get proper treatment when you\u2019re sick, right?\u201dI emphasized the need for a private clinic to doctors. They also sympathized with my purpose, and the story was generally easy to solve.It was not long before the doctor\u2019s order was reached. Kaelus and I were also poised to sit back and listen.But then.\u201cMaster\u2026!\u201dThe butler, Uross, rushed in with a rare flushed face. He\u2019s not quite a runner, what\u2019s going on?\u201c?\u201dKaelus raised his eyebrows in wonder.Uross whispered quietly enough to be heard only by us.\u201cHer highness the crown princess is here!\u201d\u201c?!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dKaelus\u2019 face revealed his embarrassment.I had no time to think back and forth, so I told Kaelus.\u201cGet ahead, Kael!\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dWhen a person suddenly gets flustered, their mind goes blank.Just like that, Caelus got up in a daze, pushed by my hand.\u201cMaster, then this way\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIt has been very rare for Kaelus to be so dazed in recent years, but today we saw a rare sight in many ways.The doctor and the guests were looking at us. I was terribly sorry.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I made a mess.\u201dI clapped my hands to call attention.\u201cWell, let\u2019s continue what we\u2019ve been doing. Please, sir.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dI managed to pull myself together and look forward.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy heart was pounding.I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Lily Palace was still peaceful today.A white palace with reverence and solemnity. It was a scene that resembled the owner of this palace.Not long after Diana entered the Lily Palace, aristocratic young ladies often came and went. But as the days went by, most of the people who visited the Lily Palace were priests rather than nobles.And the decisive event.After the marquis\u2019 wife openly clashed with Princess Diana in the background of the Lily Palace, even the few noble friends who were left separated.Even Madame Harmonia, who once helped her both physically and mentally.Diana sat alone in a quiet patronage.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn her hand was a letter from Madame Harmonia a while ago.It\u2019s been a long time since she didn\u2019t reply to her. Still, the reason why she read the letter regularly was because of the sincerity of Harmonia was felt in every line.Harmonia\u2019s words were always the same. \u2018You have to act like a crown princess.\u2019Diana had the hardest time accepting this.People should always be the same, so why do they have to change when their status changes? Isn\u2019t that what she hates the most? Changes with time and place?Why Helios and Kaelus were attracted to her was also her unchanging beliefs and actions.A saintess who lives on the basis of a solidly rooted truth, not a politician who changes according to the situation. Both men loved that aspect of her very much.\u201c\u2026I can\u2019t lose.\u201dDiana crumpled up the letter.The day before, I met Hestia in secret and came back. And more determined.I\u2019m going to get Kaelus back.\u201cKael\u2026!\u201dThe sly Hestia attacked Diana\u2019s gaps like a demon. She counter-attacked by strikingly overturning her logic.That\u2019s it. That black villain whispered a sweet temptation too.\u201cTo Kael\u2026 \u2026 to apologize\u2026?\u201dShe almost fell apart.The temptation that leads her to give up her beliefs and morals that she had kept while struggling alone in the palace.\u201cIf I apologize to Kaelus\u2026\u201dDiana swallowed a trembling sigh.She can\u2019t do it.She must never go back on what she said. It is also unacceptable to apologize without sincerity just because the situation was difficult right now.It is so difficult to live up to one\u2019s beliefs.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dShe hoped Kaelus knew her true feelings.Then he doesn\u2019t have to swallow his tears alone.~~~~Helios found the emperor\u2019s residence with Kaelus, who was about to be promoted to duke.\u201cYour majesty, Marquis Kaelus is here.\u201d\u201cOh, you\u2019re here?\u201dThe emperor was relaxing in his comfortable indoor clothes. He was very pleased when the two sons entered.\u201cNow that we\u2019ve passed the cabinet meeting, all we have left is the title ceremony, Kaelus. It\u2019s a pleasure.\u201d\u201cBut with something more important ahead, my heart is heavier than joy, your majesty.\u201dKaelus responded modestly.Helios also said with a faint smile.\u201cIn fact, the Marquis contributed greatly to the stability of the political situation. I should have done it earlier, so I feel late, your Majesty.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true, Helios. I felt very sorry for Kaelus for not being in a hurry.\u201dThe emperor\u2019s voice sank in confusion.Kaelus did not forget that his promotion to the throne and his wife\u2019s estates were the products of political transactions between Helios and Hestia. Therefore, it was nothing to be pleased with himself.If he recites an accusation against the temple instead of Hestia in front of the emperor.\u201c\u2026\u201dThose two who want to protect Diana will be deeply embarrassed.The current imperial authority gained by Kaelus\u2019 purge of Duke Orcus may soon fall again into his hands.If the emperor and Helios give up Diana, they will maintain their authority, but if they choose to do the opposite.\u201cHaha, it\u2019s nice to see Kaelus with good news today.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m grateful, your majesty.\u201dKaelus responded politely.~~~~After leaving the emperor\u2019s residence.Helios returned to his office as usual. Kaelus also walked slowly outside the Lion Palace because there was nothing more to deal with inside the palace.Then, one person caught his eye.\u201c\u2026 Greetings to the great little moon of the empire.\u201dKaelus was courteous with a cold sinking heart.A soft smile bloomed on the other person\u2019s face.\u201cAt ease, Kaelus.\u201dKaelus, looking at Diana, was confused.He thought she\u2019d never show him that smile again. But in just a year, Diana smiled as if she had gone completely back to the past.She didn\u2019t blame him any more. Kaelus also had no more regrets about her.Kaelus thought it wouldn\u2019t be a bad idea to just bury it as it is, without considering the mistakes of the past, where all kinds of emotions were intertwined.He had no intention of trying anything to restore the relationship. He just wanted to live their lives in each other\u2019s place without any help, without hate or longing.Kaelus already had Hestia, and Diana was not a substitute for her.Nevertheless, Diana approached softly.\u201cYou must be coming to see his majesty.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dHis dry answer made Diana feel sorry.Would it be better to move places?\u201cIf you weren\u2019t busy, would you go to the Lily Palace?\u201d\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ve had a lot of work.\u201dAn inorganic refusal to return her invitation.Diana, contrary to her serene appearance, was deeply lost inside. It was unfortunately a talent that Diana did not have to lead a wooden-stone opponent.\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201dShe managed to get a bitter smile on her face.But she should not let Kaelus go like this. She could not convey all her true feelings only when she encountered him in\u00a0 the palace in this way.You have to pluck up your courage.\u201cKael, I heard you\u2019re going to be a duke soon. So\u2026.\u201dKaelus looked at Diana expressionless. Diana was handed something from the maid who followed. Judging from the maid\u2019s attire, she also seemed to be from the new building.Diana had a small cloth pocket in her hand.\u201cI made it to wish you good health. I want you to take it.\u201dHe didn\u2019t know exactly what the contents were, but it must be something like a holy object made by a saintess.Kaelus accepted it for now.\u201cThank you, your grace.\u201dWith a brief thank you, he turned around without hesitation.\u201c\u2026\u201dA backside without a moment\u2019s hesitation.Diana was absolutely lonely.Hestia\u2019s whispers rang again like a hallucination.[Apologize to him.]Does that make everything easier?\u201c\u2026\u201dShe was shaking.Diana closed her eyes tightly.~~~~Kaelus returned home and sat in his study as usual.When he put the political papers on the desk, something in his bag caught his eye.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe cloth bag that Diana gave him.Kaelus had a fundamental question. Why the hell is Diana coming to him?He knew her relationship with Helios had deteriorated. But why does that lead to a change in relations with him?Moreover, he was Hestia\u2019s husband, whom Diana hates.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dI opened my pocket for now. As he expected, it contained a holy bracelet with some coarse beads sewn together.Leaving it still on his palm, Kaelus was lost in thought.Diana is under a big illusion.She seemed to think that Kaelus\u2019 feelings will be the same as before.So if she gave him a little thing like that, he would quickly give his heart as affectionately as he did back then.So easily.\u201c\u2026\u201dHis eyes narrowed as he looked at the holy object.\u201cWell, it\u2019s not unreasonable\u2026\u201dA bitter talk with oneself.A man with a crush was about to die because she married another man. Looking back now, it seems that at that time, he seriously threw his reason and lived only in emotion.Kaelus really loved Diana.He really burned everything down, so there was not even a little regret left.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dHe shook his head.He rose slowly from his seat. It wasn\u2019t dinner yet, but he decided to start a fire in the fireplace a little early.A slow flame. In it, Kaelus threw in the holy object in\u00a0 his possession.Soon the bracelet burned black.\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus looked at the shape with an indifferent stare.In fact, it wouldn\u2019t matter if he put it somewhere in the corner, but he would hate it more if Hestia was disturbed by that thing.\u201cHestia. Hestia.\u201dHe recited it a couple of times. A feeling that spread warm rather than hot.How hungry he was for being there even though he pushed away a little out of impatience.Hestia saved him, and his life after that was entirely due to her.Then why can\u2019t he live for Hestia with his free time?\u201cFirst of all, a real husband and wife\u2026\u201dKaelus laughed his head off.A wife who sends infinite affection to him but strangely does not cross any line.He didn\u2019t know how to explain it to her. Love seemed to be love, but he don\u2019t know exactly the identity of it.But it doesn\u2019t matter. If the opponent doesn\u2019t cross the line, shouldn\u2019t he just cross the line?\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a dream, Hestia.\u201dThe lips he stole in the middle of the night were sweet. Next time, he wouldn\u2019t steal, but he\u2019d get it proudly.A smile spread.His heavy heart quickly became lighter.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs news spread that Kaelus was about to be promoted to duke, the marquis\u2019 mansion was crowded with people coming to give gifts and greetings.Of course, Kaelus didn\u2019t even bother greeting them. Not only was he not interested in the group who wanted to get ahead, but he came out of the study because he was preoccupied with negotiating strategies with the kingdom just around the corner.Still, I was the hostess, so I sat in the living room and greeted the guests. The sincerity they sent me is fine as long as I receive the gift well and not their heart.I didn\u2019t clean up the presents on purpose and piled them up in the drawing room. To make people feel intimidated every time they bring a present.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dWhen I was alone in the drawing room for a while, a grumpy laugh naturally leaked out.It\u2019s time for the next visitor.\u201cWhoa, Marchioness Hestia. There\u2019s not much time left until I call you like this. Next time, I\u2019ll call you the duchess.\u201d\u201cOh, Countess Erinnis!\u201dA friendly welcome from Erinnis. I was welcomed by a person I knew well for the first time in a long time.As soon as she sat down, she said.\u201cHonestly, aren\u2019t you surprised? They even raised the title of a servant in diplomatic negotiations with the kingdom.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dThe aristocratic society within the empire was unaware that there was a war at stake in negotiations with the kingdom. However, what they knew was that the kingdom was unable to recover from last year\u2019s floods \u2013 a major incident in the original novel \u2013 and that led to frequent plundering at the border with the empire.Due to the complacent perception that it would lead to war, I was in great confusion before returning, but this time it changed. Helios, who exercised his sovereignty on behalf of the emperor, proceeded stably with an outstanding servant named Kaelus.Thanks to this, the imperial society was able to welcome the emergence of new dukes without much sense of crisis.I giggled.\u201cPeople compare me to the Duke Orcus a lot, don\u2019t they?\u201d\u201cPhew, the marchioness really quick at what\u2019s going on in the world.\u201dErinnis shook his head with an obnoxious glance.\u201cWhen everyone heard that Hestia was being granted the estate of Attica, everyone was whispering that the marquis had absorbed the old duke completely.\u201d\u201cWhoa, it\u2019s all the more so because I\u2019m fighting the crown princess like Letona.\u201dI didn\u2019t deny it as it was old-fashioned.Erinnis put the cup on her lips and put it down silently.\u201cBut these days, there\u2019s a strange rumor going around again.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cThe crown princess is wagging her tail at the marquis again\u2026 That\u2019s\u2026.\u201dErinnis was embarrassed and speechless to the end.I burst into laughter because of the rather blatant expression in her usual elegant aristocratic accent.\u201cNo, countess! It\u2019s a perfect metaphor. I can\u2019t believe you hit the nail.\u201d\u201cWell, my words and actions were a little frivolous, right? I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cHahaha, no. I\u2019m not surprised because I already knew.\u201d\u201cOh, did you?\u201d\u201cYes. My husband told me first. The crown princess has become kind.\u201dErinnis drew a grin.\u201cThe marquis and his wife don\u2019t have to worry. Both of you are cool-headed.\u201dI also smiled, bending the ends of my lips diagonally.\u201cIt\u2019s not an emotional relationship. In that sense, the crown prince and his wife are quite anxious.\u201d\u201cHmm, but it was just as romantic.\u201dHow can romance feed you? I repressed what I wanted to reply to with a dignified remark.\u201cRomance alone is not enough for the aristocracy and royalty. Isn\u2019t love like a novel only in novels?\u201dI sighed briefly and then added.\u201cBut I guess the crown prince intends to protect the saintess until the end.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s right. The marquis\u2019s wife stopped making a plan. He\u2019s preparing to fight back\u2026\u201dErinise also breathed a sigh.I said with a certain determination.\u201cBut the temple charges won\u2019t stop. I\u2019m waiting for the opportunity.\u201d\u201cI will keep an eye on the trend of the crown princess, marchioness.\u201dA significant smile between political comrades.There will be only a cliff ahead of Helios and Diana.~~~~After Erinnis returned, Madame Harmonia appeared.\u201cLady Hestia. I heard you have good news, so I came to see you.\u201d\u201cWelcome, Madame Harmonia.\u201dI felt sorry for her thin face. She seems to be having a hard time because of Diana.That\u2019s right. It would\u2019ve been easier if we cut it off quickly. I clicked my tongue inside.My tea was so badly made that I slipped the teapot in front of her.Harmonia smiled a little.\u201cI guess it\u2019s still not easy to kick in.\u201d\u201cPhew, I\u2019m trying, but I\u2019m not getting better. I\u2019m embarrassed, but I have no choice but to embrace it because I\u2019m not good enough.\u201dI smiled softly.\u201c\u2026\u201dHarmonia couldn\u2019t easily move her mouth as if something was overwhelming her.I knew what she was thinking, so my thoughts slipped first.\u201cHer Highness Diana\u2026 Is that why?\u201dHarmonia\u2019s eyes soon moistened.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, marchioness. I\u2019m here to congratulate you, but I\u2019m so depressed.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019m most grateful to madam for showing her true feelings.\u201dI asked, placating her moderately.\u201cDid madam hear the rumor? The crown princess to my husband\u2026\u2026.\u201dAfter deliberately trailing the end of the sentence, Harmonia dropped her head.\u201cI don\u2019t understand how the most virtuous saintess of all can behave in such a disrespectful way\u2026\u201dSomehow she is sadder than I am. Some might think that Diana had an affair with Harmonia\u2019s husband \u2013 but she is, of course, single.\u201cDo you keep in touch with the saint?\u201d\u201cAs I said before, marchioness. Her highness hasn\u2019t replied to my letter in a long time.\u201dHarmonia smiled bitterly.\u201cI\u2019m not willing to give you any more advice. I\u2019m just having a hard time on my own.\u201d\u201cMadam, you\u2019re going to get sick.\u201dShe shook her head in a lonely way despite the worried words.\u201cMy heart feels empty.\u201dI am genuinely confused.She\u2019s another person who suffers from the same aftereffects as my favorite. She is also suffering enough, if not as extreme as my favorite. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s disappointed because her affection for Diana was sincere.I\u2019ll have to soothe her empty heart somehow.\u201cHarmonia. I want you to think seriously about what I\u2019m saying from now on.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you close the salon for a while and travel to Illion or other territories?\u201d\u201cTravel\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m more worried than anything that madam might get more depressed. Alas, why don\u2019t you help me with my work at Attica estate? Madam would make a great acting lord.\u201d\u201cAre you talking about the marquis\u2019 estate?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m about to be granted the vast Attica estate. There must be a lot of work to do. I can\u2019t do it all by myself.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHarmonia is starting to worry quite seriously.I was more persuasive in her presence.\u201cI\u2019ll be so busy that I can\u2019t think of the capital for a while. It\u2019s going to be a new challenge for madam.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cNow I\u2019m going to have to ask you a favor, Madam Harmonia. Please take charge of the management of the estate in Attica.\u201d\u201cWill I be of service to the marchioness\u2026?\u201dI nodded my head loudly at the question that came out without confidence.\u201cOf course!\u201dHarmonia greeted me with a much brighter complexion than when she first came in.\u201cMarchioness, thank you very much. Thanks to you, I feel very lighthearted. I\u2019m here to congratulate you, but I\u2019m going back to being comforted.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. I\u2019ll be waiting for Madame\u2019s reply.\u201dI sent her back with a bright face, too.~~~~After that, I was completely exhausted by the constant reception of the guests until the sun went down.\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201dI was exhausted from eating at the dining hall, so I told the maid to make a simple sandwich and bring it to my room, and then I stretched out to the bed.\u201cOh, my. I smiled so much that my cheekbones hurt\u2026\u201dI\u2019m so tired that I can\u2019t help but laugh. I must have lost my mind.I heard a knock on the door just in time. The meal seems to be here.\u201cCome on in.\u201dI stretched out tiredly, only raising my voice. By the way.\u201cOh my god\u201dAn involuntary outpouring of breath. The body bounced up like a spring.\u201cWhy are you so surprised?\u201dIt was none other than my favorite entering the door!Kaelus appeared with a tray of sandwiches and coffee cups.I gasped in surprise\u201cOh\u2026 I\u2026\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t have the energy to come to the dining hall, so I brought it. I can eat here too.\u201dKaelus was really going to eat a sandwich in my room, so he put the tray down on the table and sat down.\u201cCome here, Hestia.\u201dWhat\u2019s wrong with you, Kaelus? My heart keeps racing because of you, so I think it\u2019s going to stop any minute.\u201cHmm. Didn\u2019t you have the strength to come all the way here? Then\u2026\u201dSuddenly he stood up with a sandwich, and I got up and came to the table.At last, I slowly sat down on the sofa.\u201c\u2026\u2026Thank you.\u201dI managed to open my mouth with a flushed face.\u201cI thank you, Hestia. You had a hard time meeting people in my place today.\u201dMy favorite who smiles softly.Seriously, with that face, I\u2019ve settled all the work I have to get today.It\u2019s a very rewarding day.~~~~Finally, the day came when Kaelus rises up to duke.Throughout imperial history, it was rare for the marquis to be promoted to duke. So to speak, today is a historic day.Therefore, I also stood before the emperor as the marquis\u2019 wife. Of course, the title award and the warrant will be given simultaneously on the spot.\u201cA vast estate, heir to Attica\u2026!\u201dI hummed and recited a verse that appeared in the original description of Letona Princess.A refreshing morning air. It was still green outside because the lady-in-waiting hadn\u2019t come to wake me up yet.\u201cHuh\u2026\u201dI hummed lightly and spun around.Seeing the dance come out naturally, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m very excited today.\u201cThe land of cold snow and ice! Duke of the North!\u201dI giggled.If I were a man, I would have been the famous \u201cDuke of the North,\u201d but unfortunately, because I was a woman, I became the Duchess of the North instead of the Duke of the North.Well, let\u2019s take it easy. Even if it\u2019s not a Northern duke, which is a typical rofan male character, it means that I am quite the rofan female character since I became Northern Duchess.Good is good. Let\u2019s think in a good way on a good day.\u201cMadam, are you up?\u201d\u201cYes. Come on in.\u201dAs usual, Clarice came at a fixed time. One difference is that her expression is brighter than ever.\u201cIt\u2019s your last morning as a marquis\u2019 wife.\u201d\u201cHa ha, that\u2019s right.\u201dAfter Kaelus becomes a duke, my status naturally rises to duchess.Some people would feel sick to their stomach. but is there a difference? If you are upset, you will bounce back.The lady-in-waiting smiled and said.\u201cWe\u2019ll take care of the party while you\u2019re at the palace, Lady Hestia.\u201d\u201cOh, yes. I look forward to your kind cooperation, Clarice.\u201dHer mood is as good as mine, and the evening party seems to play a part.~~~~Since I became possessed, I have acquired a lot and climbed into a carriage.Like me, well-dressed Kaelus is truly admirable.\u201cYou look wonderful, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cReally? You\u2019re beautiful, too.\u201dKaelus replied plainly, but the level of excitement equivalent to the lethal dose already hit my heart. I couldn\u2019t say thank you and was speechless.The carriage, which had become so quiet, arrived at the palace as it was.Kaelus expressed his intention in advance that he did not want to make it grandiose, so the promotion ceremony, which is rarely held in imperial history, will be relatively simple.Perhaps that\u2019s why the air around the Lion Palace is as good as ever.I entered the Lion Palace under the escort of Kaelus.Waiting for us to appear, there were a number of nobles standing in the hallway without entering the hall.\u201cOh, marquis! Congratulations!\u201d\u201cMay the marquis be blessed, too. What a happy day it is.\u201dI was completely distracted by all the congratulations pouring from here and there. The steps forward stopped before I knew it.I was answering the greetings for a long time, but suddenly, the loud noise gradually subsided from the back.\u201c\u2026?\u201dKaelus and I looked back slowly.Helios was walking alone down the hall.Everyone, including us, was courteous.\u201cGreetings to the great little sun of the empire.\u201dHelios nodded with a noble royal expressionless face.\u201cEveryone, get up.\u201dGiven that Diana was not next to him, perhaps she would appear with the emperor.It\u2019s a shame in many ways for Diana and Helios. Rumors of a feud between the crown prince and his wife were already spreading in society.If the two had the will to improve this chaotic atmosphere, they should have taken this time as an opportunity to join hands for show.With his tongue in his mouth, Helios strode toward us.\u201cToday is a special day for both of you.\u201d\u201cI am just grateful for the kindness of his majesty and the crown prince.\u201dKaelus responded politely.I glanced around.People\u2019s curious eyes flew in and stick in. How the crown prince treats Kaelus seems to be the show to watch.The reason is simple. Because the pre-marriage triangle was re-established after marriage. What an exciting drama.There\u2019s one thing that\u2019s different from before. If Diana, who is in the middle, chose Helios before marriage, she leaned toward Kaelus a year after marriage.What kind of ending will it be this time? Will Kaelus hold Diana\u2019s hand again? Will Helios just lose Diana like this?The eyes around us sparkle with low interest.Unpleasant.\u201cYour highness the crown prince, please lead the way in. We\u2019ll follow you.\u201dI exhorted, keeping my tone as calm as possible.The two quickly caught onto the situation. Helios nodded briefly and strode into the hall. Kaelus and I straightened our backs and followed suit.~~~~The title ceremony was held in a standing manner without providing a separate seat for the participants. Only the royal family could sit on the glorious throne on the platform.On top of several shallow steps were large chairs for the emperor. And next to it, the chairs of the crown prince and his wife were placed side by side.From the top seat, a red carpet crossed the hall. It meant that the ceremony was very special and sacred.Instead of sitting directly in his seat in the upper seat, Helios stood with us.When I looked at him in wonder, he said casually.\u201cIt\u2019s boring to sit alone.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dI almost burst out laughing.Anyway, even if Helios was standing with us, I didn\u2019t have much to talk to him. So I looked at Kaelus as if I were asking for help.Fortunately, as if he knew my silent signal, Kaelus spoke to Helios in his usual dry tone.\u201cHow is his majesty\u2019s condition?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too much to walk or stand long. I\u2019m glad he doesn\u2019t look so bad.\u201dHelios sighed quietly.It is already publicly known that the emperor\u2019s energy is decreasing day by day. Even so, it must be Diana who cannot honestly admit it.Therefore, it is a bold decision to appear here today to award the title directly.\u201cHis majesty must be very prepared.\u201dHelios also affirmed my muttering words.\u201cBecause he felt the need to prove his health.\u201dI asked quietly.\u201cIs it related to the transaction between me and your highness?\u201dHelios\u2019 eyes thinned. The tone was blunt, but the answer came out anyway.\u201c\u201d\u2026.That\u2019s a pretty screwed-up remark. Yes.\u201dIt\u2019s a real nuisance. Diana.Wouldn\u2019t it have been better to confess that your healing power has disappeared and establish your authority in a different way?If that was the case, the sick emperor wouldn\u2019t have to stand in front of the jackal-like nobles with his sick body.\u201cHis Majesty is suffering beyond words. I\u2019m so sorry that I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dDespite my rather sharp remarks, Helios said nothing.By the way, rumors are so widespread in the society that Diana is distracted, and Helios cannot be unaware of this.What does he think of his different-minded companion?If there were only the two of them, I would ask them directly, but unfortunately, the award ceremony will begin soon.I can\u2019t do it. I have to promise next time.\u201cHis majesty the emperor and the crown princess are coming in! Be polite, everyone!\u201dHelios took a step forward and stood on the red carpet. Naturally, Kaelus and I took a step back.The Emperor and Diana, who appear at the venue soon after. The emperor held Diana\u2019s hand and escorted her with slow steps.Everyone bowed in unison\u201cHonor to the emperor, the supreme glory of the empire!\u201dThe nobles waited with low posture until the emperor fully climbed to the upper seat and sat in a chair.After Helios and Diana sat in place, the emperor ordered us to stand up.\u201cGet up.\u201dWe all straightened up according to our orders.The emperor smiled kindly.\u201cThis is the day where all the people of the empire should be pleased. With the birth of a new duke family in this country.\u201dPeople\u2019s eyes were once again focused on Kaelus.A strong-hearted person who never blushes.\u201cMarquis Kaelus, come forward.\u201dAfter a light courtesy, Kaelus slowly advanced to the upper seat.Diana stood next to the emperor with a tray containing a purple cloak and a scepter symbolizing the duke. Originally, she was replacing the role that the minister should play as a saintess.The emperor slowly rose to his feet. His inability to show strong movements rather revealed his weakness.\u201cUnder your orders.\u201dKaelus knelt down in front of him. The emperor put the cloak around his shoulder by hand. Then Diana gave him the scepter, and he held it out toward Kaelus.\u201cKaelus, the emperor\u2019s servant, declares himself the duke of the empire. In addition, Hestia, his companion, is also a member of the noblest lineage under the royal family as a duchess.\u201dMy favorite, wearing a purple cape and holding a colorful scepter in my hand.As he rose and turned around, thunderous applause and cheers erupted.I walked slowly through the cheers to my favorite. I grabbed the fingers that stuck out and kissed them.We looked forward side by side.The amazing sight of all the nobles at our feet.My heart is full.When the cheers and applause of the people died down, the emperor called my name.\u201cAnd Duchess Hestia. I will give you the Attica estate in the northern part of the empire. Help the Duke and work for the prosperity of this empire.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just grateful for your kindness.\u201dI answered the emperor with modest courtesy..The emperor\u2019s soft voice rang out and headed for Kaelus.\u201cThe duke and duchess, look at me.\u201d\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201dWe held hands and looked at the emperor.A soft smile broke out on the old man\u2019s face.\u201cI\u2019m very happy to see a new duke born during my reign. For the well-being of this empire, be an example of all the people.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll keep that in mind, your majesty.\u201d\u201cYou are the pillars of this empire. I hope you will help Helios and I and become an eternal ally of the royal family.\u201dI couldn\u2019t give a quick answer to this remark. Fortunately, however, the awkward situation was averted thanks to Kaelus\u2019 skillful handling.\u201cI will not forget your request.\u201d\u201cThank you, Kael.\u201dI glanced at Diana with only my eyes moving.\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dA woman with a picturesque smile on her face.The face of the resentful woman who told me to stay away from Kaelus is a lie.~~~~We slowly descended from the top seat.The cheering nobles surrounded us. And the salute that comes in.\u201cCongratulations on the birth of the noble duke couple!\u201dI looked at Kaelus with a proud face. He also faced me with a faint smile.\u201cThanks to you, Hess.\u201d\u201cWhat did I do? You\u2019ve achieved it completely.\u201dSuddenly, the crowd surrounding us began to disperse. Turning around, Helios and Diana were approaching.It was Diana who opened her mouth first.\u201cDuke Kaelus, congratulations. The purple cape really suits you.\u201dCountless eyes were watching this scene now.Nevertheless, Kaelus responded with no tension and a very ceremonial attitude.\u201cI\u2019m honored, your highness.\u201dJust as Diana was about to say more, Helios quickly stepped in.\u201cThe duchess is now the lord of a territory. I believe that your ability will make Attica prosperous.\u201d\u201cI will do my best not to disappoint you and his majesty.\u201dI also responded calmly like Kaelus.Just in time, the emperor began to prepare to leave, so Diana and Helios could no longer stay with us and had to turn around.\u201cMay the glory of God be with you, the empire and his majesty.\u201dThe nobles honored the emperor who left the hall.I bowed down with them, too.\u201c\u2026May it be with you.\u201dMaybe the reason why the emperor doesn\u2019t let go of Diana is because he thinks she\u2019s God\u2019s agent and God\u2019s glory itself.But you have to remember. God\u2019s glory may exist, but it doesn\u2019t stay with anyone forever.~~~~After all the events at the palace were over, Kaelus and I returned home rather exhausted.The butler greeted me.\u201cAre you back, Lord Kaelus?\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m a little tired.\u201dI asked the butler.\u201cHow\u2019s the preparation for the party in the evening going?\u201d\u201cYes, there\u2019s no problem, madam.\u201dI nodded with a smile at the reliable butler\u2019s answer.\u201cThen I\u2019ll take a nap and come down. I\u2019ve been run over by people, and I\u2019m pretty tired.\u201d\u201cYes. Don\u2019t worry about this side and take a good rest.\u201dAfter confirming that Kaelus and the butler were heading to the other side of the corridor, I came into my room at a slow pace.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI returned as the lady of a great estate, but personally, nothing seems to have changed.Some say that positions make people, but there is always an essential me that nevertheless remains unchanged.Yeah, it doesn\u2019t change.\u201c\u2026\u201dNot just in one world, but the world itself does not change even if it changes.Hestia, or the common rofan reader.I tried to lie down on the bed and sat up again.\u00a0 I went to the desk and opened the fanatic note.There is no prophecy left now.No, there is one.\u201c\u2026What will happen to me\u2026\u201dIn the months before returning, I suffered quite a lot. I had a serious illness because I didn\u2019t take good care of my health, but honestly, I had no intention of treating it.I was left alone in a boring world without Kaelus, so I had no desire to live. I just lived because I couldn\u2019t die.One day, I thought I was going to die like that, so I tried to see the saintess\u2019 face for the last time, but I was coldly rejected. No matter how sad and angry I was, I ran straight into the temple\u2019s small room, sobbed with anger, and at one point I lost my mind.\u201cThat\u2019s not dying\u2026?\u201dI\u2019ve never died before or after being possessed, so I don\u2019t know. But considering that this world is a novel, the rule of fantasy novels is that I usually die before I return, so maybe I am \u2018dead\u2019 then?It\u2019s pure speculation, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s that wrong.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dI brought a box that was well placed in the corner of the dress room. It was the scarf reform that I requested from Tekima not too long ago.I gently opened the lid. The scarf that was wrapped around my neck was now a nice kravat to hang around Kaelus\u2019 neck.This is a wedding anniversary gift for Kaelus today.\u201c\u2026\u201dWill I be able to give a gift on our wedding anniversary next year?I\u2019m not sure.Once I take good care of my health so that I don\u2019t get sick, I probably won\u2019t face the same end as before my return.But before that, let\u2019s think more fundamentally.Do I want to live here with my favorite forever?Can I accept this life as my reality?It was not my will to return in the first place. When I opened my eyes, I possessed an extra in the novel, Hestia, and when I opened my eyes again, I only went back to the time in the novel.Since I\u2019m living again, I\u2019ve been trying to live my life by being a fan.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI let out a long sigh.These days, I\u2019ve been obsessed with these kind of worries. Maybe it\u2019s because I think I achieved my goal?But it\u2019s not completely over yet, and I\u2019m wasting my mental energy on this \u201cuseless\u201d worry.Don\u2019t let my guard down.Diana has yet to apologize to Kaelus. She did not break down with desperate regret.My fate is not so important in this life, where I live as an extra anyway.I\u2019ll bet my whole life on something more important.~~~~The party prepared by the servants themselves was jaw-dropping.The music was so exciting that you can\u2019t consider it a quiet mansion, and every table is full of dishes and snacks.Even if there was no flashy decoration for the guests, the energy beyond it filled the grand banquet hall.Thanks to the pre-announcement that we should not have a separate seat for our couple, Kaelus and I sat in front of a small table in the corner.The bartender, who showed off his skills at a dinner with foreign ambassadors the other day, also enjoyed the party so much that it was impossible to tell whether he came to work or play.\u201cFor the eternal health of Duke Kaelus and Duchess Hestia!\u201d\u201cFor you!\u201d\u201cFor you! Hahaha\u2026!\u201dKaelus also had a rare smile on his face.\u201cFor the Duke.\u201dI felt a lump in my throat.I hoped to see my favorite smiling face at the party. But really, he showed the brightest smile I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201cHess.\u201d\u201cYes, Kaelus.\u201dHe held up a champagne glass, so I lifted mine. The sound of a lightly striking glass.Purple eyes are beautifully bent.\u201cWe have something to celebrate separately.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI held out the box of the kravet that I had brought.\u201cIt\u2019s small, but will you take it?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dThe smile faded slightly from Kaelus\u2019 face. A nervous look.In fact, my heart is pounding and I\u2019m about to burst. How will he react to my gift?He opened the box and checked what was inside.\u201cThis is\u2026.\u201dI couldn\u2019t resist the bursting of tension and started babbling.\u201cWell, I didn\u2019t buy a new one\u2026\u2026 I fixed the scarf I was wearing with the kravet. I can\u2019t tell you to wear it often because it\u2019s old, but if you just hang it in the dress room and look at it once in a while\u2026\u201d\u201cHess. Thank you.\u201dA simple and sincere word, as if I didn\u2019t need any other modifiers.I stiffened. His purple eyes looked at me so seriously that I couldn\u2019t think of anything else.\u201cIt\u2019s the most precious gift I\u2019ve ever received. Seriously, I\u2019ve never received anything better than this.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026. Um, Gah, Thank You\u2026I\u2026.\u201dI stuttered like my mind was broken.Seriously, when your favorite\u2019s eyes look straight into your eyes, you can\u2019t think of anything and just chatter like a fool.Oh, what\u2019s wrong with me?Then Kaelus called my name once again.\u201cHestia.\u201dI was about to say yes. But at that moment.\u201c!\u201dAnother\u2019s lips that press down on my lips in an instant.Warm and soft, with a fresh scent.What the hell just happened?\u201c\u2026?!\u201dThe red lips of a man that gently come off.Silver eyelashes shake right in front of me.\u201cHess. Hestia.\u201dI was too stiff to respond to his call.A loud noise seems to be heard from a distant place.I could only hear the voice of my favorite.\u201cWhat do you say we become a real couple?\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dSomething that hits my heart hot,Tears welled up in my eyes.~~~~A real couple.A pure \u201ccouple\u201d without a cold modifier, such as paper or contract.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe thing that I did to just let him live was so big that he came back to me.\u201cHestia.\u201dWhen my eyes were lost, Kaelus wrapped his hands around my face and made me look at him.The banquet hall was still noisy. Each person held a glass and shouted a toast and enjoyed the party loudly.Only this space with me and Kaelus is silent as if it were a different world.\u201c\u2026\u201dAll the colors in front of me melt and mix at once. I don\u2019t see anything right now. Just the feeling of being full of tears.A man who waits calmly for me who can\u2019t speak.It\u2019s so sweet. My heart aches because it\u2019s so sweet.But.\u201c\u2026a married couple is\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dEven though I barely opened my mouth, he waited in a hurry.\u201cIf we are confident in the future we will be together\u2026 \u2026 It\u2019ll come together\u2026\u201dYou can become a couple even if you don\u2019t necessarily love each other hotly.More important than emotional or sexual love is when two different people try to make a family.That\u2019s what someone calls trust and certainty.When you and the other person share your lives, can you clearly picture your future in your head? Or is there no answer at all?Are you confident that you will not regret each other when you say that this person, or vice versa, lives with you for the rest of your life?Can you generously embrace even their \u2018least favorite appearance\u2019 that exists in one another?I am Hestia and not Hestia at the same time.I am a person who has a reality rooted in the world outside the novel and am also a person who has spent a short time in the world in this novel.I\u2019m a commoner duchess who turned my husband into a duke and owned a huge estate, but on the other hand, I\u2019m an ordinary novelist who has nothing but information in the rofan novel.After seeing my humble real self, pretending to be a person with the ability of prophecy that would run out, and having no real ability at all.Could Kaelus still paint a happy future for me?\u201dMy future in this world, I\u2019m not sure for myself.\u201cNot yet, not yet\u2026 I think it\u2019s a little early\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s not because I don\u2019t trust you, Kaelus.I don\u2019t believe in myself.I\u2019m just a big fan of my favorite, and I\u2019m not a woman who shines enough to fit in with the empire\u2019s best man, Kaelus.If this was my reality, I would have lived harder to polish myself.But isn\u2019t this a novel? The world in print that I\u2019ve been reading over and over and over again.At a time when I wonder if even this body really exists.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026.\u201dNevertheless, Kaelus answered, wiping my wet eyes with his fingers.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll wait.\u201dHe might be disappointed, but he never stopped smiling.\u201cInstead, we can never divorce while you\u2019re thinking about it properly.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dI laughed at his words, which seemed light and serious.What are you saying?How can I leave my favorite? Kaelus is the only reason in the world for my long life.He spoke stiffly.\u201cI\u2019ll give you my present on the day we become a real couple.\u201d\u201cOh, is it a ring?\u201d\u201c\u2026you\u2019re not surprised.\u201dCan you believe he\u2019s this cute?My favorite is pretty no matter what.~~~~The boisterous party continued into the night. The duke could not easily quench his excitement.In the end, Kaelus and I, who couldn\u2019t overcome fatigue, were out first. Even though we said we would go back to the bedroom, the maidservants and other employees only told us to hurry up and go to bed, but we didn\u2019t think about going to bed.What a joy it must be. It seems that they intended to pour out all their energy that they have not been able to properly burst out due to their quiet owner.Eventually, I left the noisy banquet hall and came up to the second floor with Kaelus.\u201cGood night.\u201d\u201cYes, you, too.\u201dA short but friendly greeting.It\u2019s so Kaelus-like that I smile on my own.\u201c\u2026\u201dAfter seeing each other open their own doors at the end of the hall, Kaelus and I went into the bedrooms.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI flopped down on the bed.I crawled into the quilt. Because I had so many emotions and thoughts today, I really didn\u2019t want to think about anything when I slept.At a time when my mind was so slowly drowsy.\u201c\u2026?\u201dA low knock.I forcefully woke my mind that was about to fall asleep and raised my voice.\u201cWho\u2026?\u201d\u201cHess. It\u2019s me.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI was wide awake in an instant.No, who comes to a girl\u2019s room in her pajamas at this late hour?!\u201cKael?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dInstead of responding aloud, the bedroom door opened.My husband appeared with his silver hair hanging down in a sexy way. No, my favorite!\u201cOh, what brings you\u2026?\u201dIt\u2019s because it\u2019s dark at night, otherwise my face would have been seen as it was about to burst red.\u201cI want to hold your hand until you fall asleep.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dIf I say, \u201cI don\u2019t need that,\u201d my favorite will get hurt, right?More than that, can Kaelus\u2019 character suddenly change like this? Why are you so aggressive? What\u2019s wrong with you?\u201cLike this\u2026 all of a sudden?\u201dWait! You said that you\u2019d wait!Whether he knew my silent scream, Kaelus asked, tilting his head to his side.\u201cDon\u2019t you have to check in bed whether I\u2019m suitable as a husband?\u201dUgh! I think I\u2019m going crazy!I guess my expression was such a spectacle. I heard a little laugh from him.\u201cIt was a joke.\u201dNo, it wasn\u2019t a joke. It can\u2019t be a joke.\u201cI\u2019ll really hold your hand, so I just want to see your sleeping face.\u201dThe question, \u201cWhy?\u201d hit my throat, but I tried to swallow it.If I actually said that, Kaelus might be hurt.How can I hate Kaelus, who has a crush on me? I\u2019d rather be lucky if I don\u2019t attack him.But, as I\u2019ve been thinking about before, maybe a better person than me who has a better future can appear in Kaelus\u2019 life.If he rushed to accept me as a companion, I\u2019ll be so sorry for him in the future.That\u2019s why I hesitated.\u201cCan\u2019t I?\u201d\u201c\u2026that much\u2026\u201dI shuffled my way into the covers. Kaelus, sitting on the edge of the bed, lightly held my hand out of the blanket.If I want to get him out of here soon, I\u2019d better go to bed soon, right?\u201cWell, then\u2026\u201d\u201cGood night, Hess.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s not think about anything. You\u2019re not thinking about anything.My hands are paralyzed now. I\u2019m not feeling anything with my hands.There\u2019s no one next to me. I\u2019m alone in this room.I hypnotized myself desperately. I kept suppressing my instinct to be conscious of Kaelus.The thumps automatically fills the heart. I\u2019m out of breath.I\u2019m short of oxygen.I\u2019m going to faint.\u201c\u2026\u201dNo way.Am I going to die like this?~~~~\u201c\u2026\u201dFortunately, I didn\u2019t die and opened my eyes. What I see in front of me is the familiar view of my room.Then, the sudden memory made my spine shiver. Maybe, maybe, again?!I swallowed my saliva and slowly turned around.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dBehind my back was an empty bed.It\u2019s a relief, but it\u2019s a shame at the same time.You really left because I told you to. If you let your hair down in such a sexy way, you should\u2019ve done something here.I sighed quietly.\u201cYou lewd devil\u2026\u201dBy the way, I wonder if any of the occupants of the mansion is okay after running like that yesterday. Maybe everyone just collapsed and can\u2019t get up.Slowly I pulled myself out of bed. I opened the terrace door wide and breathed fresh morning air.After a while, there was a knock on the door and a maid\u2019s voice.\u201cMadam, it is Clarice.\u201d\u201cCome on in.\u201dOh, I guess I succeeded in getting up on time.But her face, which soon appeared, was, of course, full of traces of hard work the day before.\u201cUmm\u2026 Let\u2019s get some rest today, Clarice.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright. A glass of honey water is enough.\u201dShe retorted. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be okay at all.\u201cYou\u2019d better just do as I say. I know how hard it is to have a hangover.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe maid couldn\u2019t say anything.I communicated instructions to all the duke\u2019s servants through the yard. \u201cTake as much rest as possible today.\u201dBreakfast was also prepared by the butler Uross, not the chef. Fortunately, he didn\u2019t drink that much the day before.\u201cAs soon as the cook wakes up, I\u2019ll make a gift for each noble family.\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s nothing urgent, so take your time.\u201dIn commemoration of Kaelus becoming a duke, I decided to give gifts to each house. In this world, cake would be better than rice cake, so I decided to do it.The first day as a duchess peacefully began.I hope it stays like this until the day I reach my goal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAnother shock hit the cluttered society. It was because of the news that Madam Harmonia\u2019s salon, which has served as a social love room for decades, will be handed over to a new owner.It was madam, who was one of the few pro-princess figures in society. Even if she hadn\u2019t revealed everything, most of the customers who visited the salon would have had a hunch that Diana was involved in her decision.This was also seen in the letter sent to me by Erinnis.\u201cThat\u2019s another person who\u2019s taken a leave of absence from the Crown Princess\u2026.\u201dI shook my head excitedly and giggled.Anyway, even the nobles who were hostile to Diana from the beginning.The departure of Harmonia, a representative figure who was intimate with her, was very symbolic. Even her departure from the capital meant that in the capital society, someone who was favorable to Diana was wiped out.Although Diocke was close enough to share tea with Diana, she was definitely not on her side when she had her usual behavior.Therefore, the fact that Diana didn\u2019t even grasp Dioke\u2019s identity proved that she had completely lost her social connections.All that was left for Diana was really the temple.But even the temple pressed Diana with an IOU. For her, she\u2019s been stabbed by a trusted person with an ax.\u201cHmph. Do you think I\u2019ll cut you some slack?\u201dSoon the temple will also sink with Diana. I can\u2019t let you escape alone.Maybe they borrowed Diana\u2019s hand because they couldn\u2019t openly pursue profit in the name of the temple. It\u2019s very cowardly.The sinking of a merchant ships has also begun to cast doubt on the temple.This is because people realized that the temple, which had always been struggling with budget shortages and asked for donations, actually had as much wealth as the lord of Illion.A temple that sympathizes with the people who have nothing is just an illusion. In fact, on top of the heads of the common people, they were immersed in the wealth of wealth. Even when the common people were moaning about the epidemic.\u201cSo\u2026 \u2026 they claim to be servants of God\u2026 It\u2019s really a betrayal of the divine teachings\u2026\u201dI wrote down every sentence of the complaint carefully.It was an oar that had already been stirring even before the water came in. However, thanks to this incident, we will not only row but also sail and continue.But the accusation does not belong to Diana\u2019s staunch political opponent, Duchess Hestia.Surprisingly, Duke Kaelus, once an ardent supporter of Diana, will act.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe hand that was refining the complaint suddenly stopped.Before reading this document at a cabinet meeting, Kaelus faces a representative of the enemy across the border.An ice-cold diplomatic negotiation, a very important task at stake.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dAlong sigh.By the way.\u201c\u2026?\u201dAt the same time, I suddenly realized it.A huge problem that has never been recognized.\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dA fact that didn\u2019t exist before the return, a work that I couldn\u2019t \u2018predict\u2019.It was the safe return of Kaelus, who crossed the border.Why did I think of this now like a fool?The success of diplomatic negotiations was convinced not by prophecy but by thorough preparation.Therefore, that did not immediately lead to the guarantee that Kaelus would return safely.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe absence of \u2018prophecy\u2019 felt by the skin in an instant. It was much more hopeless and frightening than I expected.In fact, strictly speaking, the diplomatic negotiations themselves have not been successful. Helios was the main subject before the return, but this time it was changed to Kaelus.But will my favorite fail to prepare and work for a long time? Kaelus\u2019 diplomatic power is far superior to that of Helios.\u201cYes\u2026 Let\u2019s trust my favorite\u2026\u201dAll I have to do is trust.The negotiations will succeed. And he\u2019ll be back safe and sound.The emperor won\u2019t let him go alone. The duke of the empire is moving directly, so he would be given the imperial guard as a guard.If they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll lie down in front of Helios\u2019 office.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dI held the tip of my fingers still and straightened them out of tension.A world without \u2018prophecy\u2019 that came like lightning at the most important moment all of a sudden.Honestly, I\u2019m scared.~~~~\u201cThe departure date has been set.\u201dKaelus called me into his study and said this quietly.I wanted to be calm in front of him, but my face turned pale.\u201cOh, I see\u2026\u201dI lowered my head slightly to hide my hardened expression.But it seemed rather strange to Kaelus.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Is there something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo, there\u2019s not\u2026\u201dKaelus seems to have interpreted my expression in a different way.\u201cNo way. Is there a prophecy here?\u201dThe lack of prophecy is rather the problem.I tried to force myself to laugh.\u201cNo, a prophecy hasn\u2019t appeared. That\u2019s why I\u2019m worried\u2026\u201dIn the end, I gave it to him frankly.Kaelus laughed quietly.\u201cIt\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026.\u201dHe took it lightly, but it is a huge problem for me, who has lived this life relying on \u2018regression\u2019 and \u2018possession\u2019.However, the voice of Kaelus is calm.\u201cYou can\u2019t predict everything anyway, can\u2019t you? It\u2019s been like that until now.\u201d\u201cBut I was able to know beforehand what was important\u2026\u201dInformation exhausted at the most important moment of all.So I feel more frustrated.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dAs if trying to soothe me, I hear a very soft voice.\u201cWhat kind of prophecy do you want to see?\u201d\u201cWhat I want to see is\u2026\u201dHe doesn\u2019t need to worry.\u201cThe success of the negotiations. And for you to come back safely.\u201dIf I could choose one of the two, I would wish for the safe return of Kaelus without a second thought.The well-being of this empire is not my concern.I only have one favorite.\u201cThen we can both make it a reality.\u201dKaelus said with a smile.I smiled faintly at him.\u201cPlease.\u201dAnd yet a heavy heart still persisted.It was still heavy.~~~~I felt the need to meet Helios before Kaelus left for the border.I have to talk about it in front of my eyes. It\u2019s a big deal if he can\u2019t pay attention to Kaelus because of something else.\u201cCome to think of it, he was always busy before I returned\u2026\u201dHelios belatedly recognized the imminent invasion of the kingdom. The lack of awareness of danger signals outside the border due to a number of domestic problems was the main cause of the humiliating agreement.Now, it\u2019s gone because of Kaelus, but Helios, who is also busy, may be missing something else.So I have to check it out myself. Before it gets really bad.We arrived at the Lion Palace.\u201cDuchess Hestia, please enter.\u201dI saluted the servant who gave me his permission.Helios was sitting in front of the desk in the office and working in full swing.\u201cAre you here?\u201d\u201cYes, your highness,\u201dNow he greeted me first before I even had the courtesy.He knows that I hate him, but he shows a very favorable attitude. Is there still a residue of emotion that was slightly shaken by me?\u201cYou\u2019re very busy.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it the same for you? You must be busy trying to figure out the Attica estate.\u201dAn indifferent answer from Helios.Anyway, I didn\u2019t come here to decide who was busier, so I quickly went down to business.\u201cI heard that the departure date for Kaelus has been set.\u201d\u201cPhew. That\u2019s right.\u201dHelios nodded dryly.I opened my mouth with a stiff accent.\u201cHow do you plan to escort the Duke?\u201dHis safety was also directed at me with a serious light.\u201cI\u2019m going to add elite guards to the level equivalent to my escort.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but could you be more specific? The number of guards, the armament they have, etc\u2026\u201dInstead of answering my question immediately, Helios stared at me for a while.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026Your highness?\u201d\u201cEven if I tell you the numbers, will you be relieved?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe hit the nail on the head.Even if Helios told me the exact number of people as I asked, I wouldn\u2019t be satisfied there. Add more, arm him more, I\u2019d be constantly anxious.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201d\u201cWe will protect Kaelus thoroughly. He will come back safely.\u201dThat confident way of speaking is very intrusive.What can he do? With some omnipotent power.\u201cYou never know.\u201dUnknowingly, a rebellious reply pops out.\u201cHow can a man be sure of his future when he has no prophecy?\u201dThis is the root of my anxiety.As I no longer know the future of this world, I have no choice but to be defined as a member of the world in this novel.Being from outside the novel, looking down at everything from an omniscient point of view and then falling to the ground in an instant.An indescribable sense of emptiness. Darkness. Uncertainty.In the many fantasies I\u2019ve read, the main character always melts into the world they possessed without any anxiety or awkwardness.But I.\u201cAre you afraid?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t answer a single question of Helios\u2019.I\u2019m afraid of the reality that comes to me.\u201cHestia, you couldn\u2019t have foreseen everything from the beginning anyway. This is also\u2026.\u201dI\u2019ve heard this a lot somewhere. The same thing my favorite said.Do you really need to listen to it twice?\u201cThere won\u2019t be any more.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI hate him trying to placate me with plain words.\u201cI will no longer have any prophecies. In the future. Never.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios\u2019 golden eyes stared at me.\u201cMy abilities are gone. I won\u2019t know anything beforehand. How can I prepare for the future without any information? Is that even possible?\u201dIt was despair that did not come in my real reality where I did not possess. Because everyone was on the same terms as me.But in this possessed world, it becomes so disastrous. All the advantages that made me adapt to this world safely have disappeared.I used to be above the whole world on one level, but now I stand on the same level as them and became the same thing.I will compete for survival with the people of this world without achieving anything on my own.How disadvantageous I am.\u201cHestia. Hestia. Look at me.\u201dA voice is heard beyond the blackened vision. The voice of Helios, the main character of this world, created for him.\u201cThat\u2019s how we\u2019ve always lived. I\u2019ve enjoyed incredible blessings for a very short time through you, but when it\u2019s gone, you can just go back to your original life.\u201dThat applies only to you. I\u2019m not me.Why doesn\u2019t this bloody charade ever end?\u201cIf you don\u2019t have wisdom, will Kaelus throw you away right away? Do you want me to dismiss you from my assistant? Of course, I appointed you on the condition of the prophecy, but even if you don\u2019t have it, you are worthy enough.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dWhen there is no answer, his voice rises even higher. As if he was begging me to listen.\u201cIt\u2019s not a sudden thing. You predicted it on your own. Your powers will be lost.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cYou said it was in two years, and now it\u2019s a little earlier than that, but anyway, you don\u2019t have to be so afraid.\u201dAt first I thought so, too. The reason I\u2019m afraid is because I don\u2019t know the future in this world.But a little while ago, I definitely realized.The real reason for my fear and despair. That\u2019s right.Between the two worlds, I don\u2019t know where the real reality is that I have to take root in.\u201c\u2026you know nothing\u2026\u201d\u201c!\u201dAs I listened to Helios swallowing his breath, I gave a bitter laugh.\u201cNo one in the world would really understand me.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026?\u201dHelios. Diana.Even my favorite, Kaelus.I revealed a distant abyss that I could never reveal to my precious Kaelus, only to my immediate opponent who had nothing to do with me.My whole body was losing strength. I should go back now.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u2026I apologize for the unacceptable manner s, your highness the crown prince.\u201d\u201cHess, it\u2019s fine\u2026.\u201d\u201cI am no longer qualified to serve you. I\u2019ll give up my job as an aide.\u201d\u201c?!\u201dHelios looked at me in bewilderment.I don\u2019t need my role anymore because I don\u2019t have any more prophecies to hand it over.I smiled at him without hesitation.\u201cKaelus\u2019 safety\u2026 I look forward to your kind cooperation.\u201dAgain, focus on the immediate goal.That is the only place I can put my mind to.~~~~I spent a few days in a gloomy mood.I had to be more careful to face Kaelus every day, but I failed to hide my feelings perfectly.I ended up causing him unnecessary anxiety.\u201cI heard that you rarely eat meals these days, Hestia.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dI smiled weakly.\u201cIt\u2019s just\u2026 I didn\u2019t really like it\u2026.\u201dHe\u2019s leaving tomorrow, and I\u2019m giving unnecessary worry to someone who has to leave on a serious mission.I don\u2019t know how far I can go.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. All you have to do is get back safely.\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI stopped laughing at the immediate response without any hesitation.\u201cI\u2019m sure you made a promise.\u201dKaelus\u2019 purple eyes looked at me seriously.\u201cHess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHeli is very worried.\u201d\u201c?\u201dWhen I looked at him, I heard him again calmly.\u201cDidn\u2019t you say you\u2019d quit your job?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dWhat am I supposed to say?I nodded indifferently.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve done my best. I don\u2019t have any prophecies anymore.\u201dUnlike Diana, who still had the power to heal, I was not a \u201ccompetent person\u201d from the beginning, and I have no money at all.It\u2019s better to get rid of useless titles as soon as possible.\u201cI don\u2019t mind but Heli thinks otherwise.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s strange. Why would the crown prince say that when he clearly knows what I\u2019ve done to them?\u201dA somewhat sarcastic tone.It\u2019s not even funny. Why did you first treat me like a liar and a fraud and now you pretend to be worried?In front of Kaelus.Recognizing that my mood was quite low, Kaelus spoke more carefully.\u201cBecause he accepted that you are competent regardless of your actions. He\u2019s a natural ruler.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. He\u2019s such a cold-hearted person.\u201dWith that coolness, he used to throw Kaelus out, and now he\u2019s crippled Diana.He says he will protect him, but the evidence is that he never actually follows his will. He is just sitting in the Lily Palace with the status of a crown prince.It seems to be \u201cprotective\u201d enough for him.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI also respond to my favorite person who keeps calling me.\u201cShall we take a walk together? I want to spend a lot of time with you before I leave tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dYou promised me you\u2019d come back safely.I hate the anxiety that fills my heart again. This weak mentality, despite vowing to trust him, breaks down the resolution every time.It\u2019s pathetic.\u201cHess.\u201dWarm hands wrapped around my frozen fingertips.I looked up at Kaelus blankly.\u201cYour hands are cold.\u201dKaelus smiled quietly.At some point, he comforted me a lot.When did it change like this? I should be my favorite\u2019s shade and shield.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dI can\u2019t help but smile.~~~~Only the sound of stepping on the grass echoes quietly.A dark night with only starlight. The moon is not out today either.On the contrary to the stormy inner thoughts, the outside world is very calm.A world that rolls indifferently regardless of my confusion and wandering. This huge world, completely out of my hands, is vague and frightening.Protect Kaelus. Please.I have no choice but to cry out like a helpless creature.\u201cWhy are you so weak? It\u2019s not like you.\u201d\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201dWhether there\u2019s a war or not, whether this empire\u2019s wealth is taken away by the kingdom.My favorite. Can\u2019t you just stay safe with me?How can I breathe and live in this fear without you?If I miss you even for a moment in front of my eyes, I\u2019m going to die of anxiety.If he disappears like this forever.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Hestia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHelios set up an escort almost as much as the emperor\u2019s. Unless there\u2019s really a war going on, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll come back safely.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dNevertheless, one in a million.What if one of the literally 10,000 cases goes wrong? My heart keeps sinking because of the various imaginations that occupy my head in an instant.\u201cIt\u2019s weird because you\u2019re always brave.\u201d\u201c\u2026I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not a criticism, it\u2019s a concern, Hestia.\u201d\u201dKaelus stopped and looked closely into my eyes.\u201cIs it such a big problem that you don\u2019t have the prophecy to be safe?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI swallowed my breath and tears.\u201cBut there\u2019s been a lot of unforeseen things that have happened, but why this time\u2026\u201dNot in a reproachful tone, but in a sincere way of consoling.The white and beautiful hands of my favorite gently covered the top of my head.\u201cBelieve in the time we spent together. Hestia, as proof of the past when I was able to prepare thoroughly thanks to your wisdom.\u201dHe lowered himself before me and looked up at me.\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid of the future, look at the past and the present that you overcame. These are the things that guide you when you are in an endlessly difficult situation.\u201d\u201cGuidance\u2026.\u201d\u201cYes, without prophecy, we can draw enough of the future. There\u2019s a mirror of the past and the present.\u201dKaelus smiled softly at me.\u201cI have a future that I can definitely draw right now. Come back safely, be a true couple with you and be with you from now on.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dCrying crept out of my throat. It\u2019s no use biting my lips.My favorite\u2019s voice made me smile.\u201cBut I\u2019m actually a little nervous.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dFingers swept the moistened corners of my eyes.\u201cI think Helios is quite interested in you.\u201d\u201c!\u201dMy heart stopped beating for a moment.I wished you wouldn\u2019t let your heart drop like that, but you idiot!\u201cSo I\u2019m definitely going to come back. I can\u2019t budge a step this time.\u201dKaelus chuckled as he stood up.\u201cSo you can count on it. If my legs are cut off, I\u2019ll crawl back with both arms.\u201d\u201cKael\u2026!\u201d\u201cHaha, that\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. I promise I\u2019ll be back in front of you with all my limbs.\u201dKaelus reassured me with his sincerity, so I should stop responding.Let\u2019s put aside tears and anxiety for a while, and lighten his heart.I turned my head with a jerk.\u201cNot only that, but you have to come back with a healthy face. Your face is the most handsome in the world.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a given.\u201dKaelus responded by putting his forehead to mine.Then, let\u2019s move on to a very natural flow.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe two lips met. And soon they dug in hot.It got entangled violently without breathing.A perfectly still worldIt was filled only with Kaelus.~~~~The night went on without a hitch.\u201cIt\u2019s very late. You\u2019re leaving in the morning, so go to bed.\u201dI stood in the hallway on the second floor and hurried Kaelus.Don\u2019t you have to be in a carriage for a long time? Just sitting still will exhaust your strength.The scoundrel pushed his back forcibly.\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to get some sleep. You need physical strength to go a long way.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dKaelus turned reluctantly.Confirming that he took a few steps, I trudged into the room.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI dragged my weak legs.I flopped down on the bed and stared blankly at the ceiling.\u201c\u2026\u201da hallucinating kiss in the garden.The lips and the texture of the tongue are still vivid. It\u2019s as if he\u2019s ordering me to never forget this sense.But when I lie alone in the dark, the anxiety that rises like a ghost permeates my heart again.\u201cSuch\u2026.\u201dA grimace. I cried with bated breath for fear of being heard.Please let him be safe. Please let him be safe.I prayed and prayed endlessly to the God of this world, who had been resentful and ridiculed.If I concentrate on my immediate favorite, I can forget the fundamental fear that encroaches me.The only string that can hold me as I am lost and wandering in my original world is Kaelus.Never again, I don\u2019t want to live in a terrible world like before the return.The life where Kaelus disappeared and I continued without meaning. I\u2019m afraid to experience that black time again.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dThe only reason I live.I didn\u2019t know it would be so scary to see my favorite go to a far place beyond my reach.In the meantime, he didn\u2019t rely on me. Actually, I was relying on him for my life.I\u2019m crying like that.\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe bedroom door opened silently.And without time to even scream.\u201c!\u201dA heavy shadow that looms above the bed.The familiar body scent and fiery body temperature pressed me down strongly.\u201cheut\u2026!\u201dIt was my favorite. The only reason I live in this world, my beautiful Kaelus.When I realized the identity of the shadow, all kinds of emotions that could no longer be suppressed burst out at once.\u201chaeup!\u201dHot breath rushed over my lips. Between the slightly open lips, something hot and soft broke in mercilessly.My mind went blank. My view became blurry, too. A vine of tongue tore through me fiercely.\u201cUhhh\u2026!\u201dAt first, I gave up my lips and then my whole body.Long, beautiful fingers laced through mine and soon four legs were a tangled mess.The stacked body was as hot as fire. At the gesture of rubbing like a beast, my temperature became like his and heated up.I can\u2019t believe it. I\u2019m sharing my body with Kaelus.But the clear five senses proved it. In every breath there was Kaelus.The ones that occupied my lips came off at last.\u201cAh\u2026 Hess\u2026.!\u201dA voice full of lust, which had never been heard before, tickled my ears.I shivered all over without realizing it. The shiver ran through the body.\u201cKa, Kael\u2026.\u201dWhat is happening to me. Is this really okay?With my beautiful favorite, like this.To roll around in disorderly roll.\u201c\u2026!\u201dBut I couldn\u2019t continue my thoughts any longer. Kaelus\u2019s fiery hand began to run wildly through the hem of my robe.In an instant, my round chest was revealed. I instinctively raised my hands and covered my chest.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKaelus smirked, and removed my cold hands from my chest. Then, he dragged down my underwear as if it were punishment.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dI trembled helplessly. Kaelus\u2019 purple eyes swept down my bare naked body.I can\u2019t stand it. I\u2019m ashamed. I closed my eyes tightly.\u201cKael, stop\u2026\u201dBut there was no answer. Instead, the sound of undressing was heard even with my closed eyes.A horribly low voice called me.\u201c\u2026Hess.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI couldn\u2019t bear to open my eyes. After that, Kaelus didn\u2019t call my name anymore.Two complete bodies overlapped on the bed. Hot, moist lips bit my earlobes. The moist tip of his tongue licked my skin.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dA chilling sensation that made my whole body flinch ran down the spine from the top of my head to my toes. The five senses of the whole body were awake at once. The deep part of the lower abdomen throbbed with the breath of Kaelus that brushed against the skin. This feeling stimulated the muscles inside the pussy.\u201cOh, well\u2026!\u201dAlas. Here it comes. I\u2019m afraid and glad of this sense that will devour me.The arms, legs, chest and stomach, and thighs were in close contact with each other\u2019s. His legs moved naturally and spread my legs. A hard, hot dick weighed down the swollen mound.A short kiss was sprinkled finely around my neck and collarbone. A body that keeps getting buried.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI twisted my body, unable to resist the tickling pleasure of riding up. But my struggle was as insignificant as a slight rebellion, because of the heavy weight of my body.\u201cHa\u2026 Hess\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe voice that bursted out like a sigh was very hot. As if he\u2019s going to get burned if he touches me.A round breast clasped in his grasp. As if in a trance, he rubbed my chest in his hand. The tip of the tongue licked and cleaned the nipple, like sweet cotton candy.\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dAn almost lightning-like shock.My body was already as sensitive as if it were not mine. The body began to prepare for union in earnest. Deep between the legs became hot and moist.How did I know? His long, delicate fingers slipped down my thighs and scratched gently underneath.\u201c\u2026 It\u2019s wet.\u201dA languid voice rang satisfactorily.My face flushed with heat. I don\u2019t know what it looks like. I didn\u2019t even know I was shy in front of my favorite.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hess? I\u2019m very happy.\u201dKaelus\u2019 long fingers slowly entered. I couldn\u2019t make a sound, just opened my lips and puffed out my breath.\u201cHa, hah\u2026!\u201d\u201cJust hang in there. I\u2019ll make it painless.\u201dThe sticky whispering voice is terribly decadent. I doubt it\u2019s the Kaelus I\u2019ve known so far.I raised my trembling hand and touched Kaelus on the shoulder. The hard muscles were felt in the palm of my hand. I realized it again. He\u2019s a man, too. A healthy male who desires to sleep with a woman.\u201cAh, ah\u2026!\u201dReason grew numb. The foreign body that penetrated the body was soft and persistent. I shook my head here and there for the pleasure of the frantic invasion. A faint groan escaped through my lips.Kaelus, who seems to be somewhat amused.\u201cYou\u2019re quite sensitive, Hess. That\u2019s why it\u2019s better.\u201d\u201cKa, el\u2026!\u201dMy heart pounded hard. He\u2019s tasting every inch of my body and touching it. All I can do is give up my naked body and struggle underneath him.\u201cAh, uh\u2026.\u201dThe stimulus continued. Gradually, the inside of the lower abdomen clumped together.And then at some point.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI couldn\u2019t even groan and jumped up. Kaelus finally found the most sensitive place.\u201cIs it here?\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026! Ugh!\u201dI couldn\u2019t control the joy that overflowed my whole body. The waist and pelvis were twisted and shaken arbitrarily. The struggling legs kept slipping on the smooth quilt.\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201dA low-pitched laugh. My mind went blank.\u201cOh, yes\u2026!\u201dUnthinkable, nothing but a beastly instinct. As if I would not miss even a small stimulus, my whole body\u2019s senses stood on edge.The murky noise sounded embarrassingly loud. I could feel the swelling of the pussy filled with wetness.Was I this obscene? I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m spreading my legs in front of my favorite. To my shame.\u201cUmmm\u2026!\u201dI bit my lips again.Despite my desire to hide, Kaelus\u2019 kiss was just sweet. He wrapped his tongue around mine around and around, sticky and soft, and persistent as if with a little obsession.\u201cHuh\u2026!\u201dTop and bottom are committed at the same time. The sharp pleasure is scratching me like a log.I can\u2019t stand it any longer. I feel like I\u2019m going to faint like this.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dIn an instant a small climax struck. My whole body trembled. The body, which had been fully stretched, was loosened.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s frantic under the bridge. The muscles in the inside of the pussy were fluttering.My body, eager for a man.\u201cHa, Hess\u2026\u201dKaelus pulled out his stuck finger and licked it. Far from being obnoxious in the blatant display of lust, my heart beats.My most beautiful favorite. My love. My Kael.No more, take me.His hands held each thigh apart with force. A hot, hard dick sharply pressed the wet part.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going in.\u201dAs soon as the short notice was over, it pushed in.\u201cUgh!\u201dEven though I was already ready to combine, my body was too soft and weak to accept what was big and strong. A scream broke out in frustration.\u201cHa, ha\u2026!\u201dAt one stroke to the end, Kaelus tilted his head back. A shivering groan a look of joy as if to quench one\u2019s deep thirst.I\u2019m satisfied, too. I\u2019m rejoicing.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dI was just panting. I didn\u2019t even groan at the pain of my raw flesh being ripped apart.A kiss of apology sank gently on my forehead. His breath was shaking as well.I barely opened my eyes and looked at him. I raised my hand and placed it on Kaelus\u2019 face.\u201c\u2026\u201dI told him with my eyes. I\u2019m fine. Don\u2019t hold it in. Pour it all out. As you wish.The purple jewels glistened as if they were holding tears.\u201cHess\u2026 I love you\u2026\u201dI smiled without saying anything. I\u2019m a little bit upset about the pain, but I\u2019ll still do my best.\u201cAh\u2026 Hess\u2026\u201dHis voice broke out like a breath. The brilliant silver hair fell on me like a waterfall.As soon as the lower body in contact seemed to have fallen slightly, it hit hard.\u201cOh my god\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dThe blazing eyes penetrated sharply. Flames flared before my eyes.\u201c\u2026!\u201dIt was a strong confrontation again. A ball of hot fire exploded in the body. The whole body flared up. My lips opened and I burst out of breath.\u201cOh, my God! Oh, my God.\u2026! Oh, my God!At last he began to move. The long silver hair shook like curtains. The overflow of affection burst forth violently.\u201cYes! Oh\u2026! Ahhhhhhh!\u201dThe flesh clattered against each other. The noise that\u2019s going through the cracks. Even the harsh breathing that he gasps out.Everything felt by the five senses was breathtaking. The giddy and ecstatic pleasure completely stained the body and spirit.\u201cHa\u2026! Ha\u2026!\u2026! Oh my God\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh! Ahhhhh\u2026! Sigh\u2026!\u201dOh, it\u2019s working. I\u2019m groaning beneath the man.I\u2019m his. Not only the mind but also the body.I will give my everything to my fascinating favorite.Now, I mean, it\u2019s all predatory.My Kael.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dThe intense lightning-like pleasure penetrated deep into the body. The flames, which were burning, spread all over the body in an instant. An unbearable heat. I bent my neck and twisted my back.\u201cGasp! Oh my! Ha\u2026! Ha\u2026!\u201dKaelus fell into a trance, and just drove in and out like a beast. His breathing became increasingly rough. The muscles of the whole body swelled up.\u201cAh! Ah\u2026!\u201dMy eyes began to turn white. My instincts cheered loudly.\u201cOh my god!\u201dAt that moment, the glare of silver fell like a waterfall from head to toe. The whole body contracted vigorously as if it had been electrocuted by an electric current. The muscles that embraced Kaelus tightened.My dear Kaelus had also climaxed.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dHe moaned loudly and poured hot sperm into my body.The two bodies that hugged each other trembled. And immediately after that, the bodies that had exhausted their strength collapsed.\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026\u201dKaelus, who scratched me sharply, left an indelible mark on my body and mind.\u201cGasp\u2026 Gasp\u2026.\u201dKaelus managed to lift his arm, breathing heavily. Sweaty arms wrapped around my waist like a vine again and pulled me in.\u201cHess, there\u2019s still a lot of night left.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dAs if he were still hungry, he ran greedily over my lips again.\u201cUhhh \u2026!\u201dIt can\u2019t be helped. If you\u2019re still hungry, I just have to give you the floor.Eventually, he was engraved into my body so that the starlight that came to mind that night would fall.~~~~The day had dawned.In the end, I greeted the morning with little sleep.\u201c\u2026\u201dWithout a word, a heavy arm stretched out from behind and wrapped me around.\u201c\u2026We have to get up. You\u2019re leaving soon.\u201dI squeezed out a voice that couldn\u2019t bear to come out. I thought I\u2019d cry if I looked back, so I kept my back turned on him.\u201cStop getting up.\u201d\u201cHess.\u201dSuddenly, a strong force pulled on my shoulder. I was forced to turn around.Long, soft silver hair trapped me.\u201cHestia.\u201dThe purple eyes that only contained me are very pretty.Smooth skin. Beautiful muscles that are delicately curved are connected along the chest and abdomen.\u201cYou\u2019re still crying.\u201dHis expression seems somehow amused.\u201c\u2026\u201dI turned my head away from his gaze. Despite the melancholy feeling, my face instantly flushed.His lips bit my earlobe.\u201cThe sound you made all night long lingers in my ears. What should I do?\u201d\u201cKael, stop\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I knew your crying was this pretty, I would have done it earlier.\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dKaelus\u2019 hand kept touching the wrong place. I raised my trembling hand and tried to grab him.\u201cStop\u2026 the time\u2026\u201dAt this rate, he would not even be able to eat breakfast and ride the carriage. A carriage ride on an empty stomach is a lot of work.But whether you know how I feel.\u201cOne last time, Hess.\u201dKaelus skillfully squeezed between my legs.I couldn\u2019t stop him any more.My legs struggled helplessly, sliding on the quilt, as my body laid heavy again.Once again, we shared our body temperature under the already bright world.\u201cWell, Kael\u2026!\u201dKaelus also knew that he was running out of time. A lost touch penetrated between my legs without hesitation. The tender skin, tinged from accepting a man all night, spilt greedily again.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s ridiculous. I feel like my body has been completely tamed by him overnight. How can it be this easy? Was I this hungry for men?Kaelus folded his eyes and smiled.\u201cWhat? You like it so much.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026\u201dMy face flushed with heat. I couldn\u2019t make any excuses because of my honest body.Kaelus lifted his chin proudly and looked at me. Then he grabbed my thighs and lifted them up.\u201cOh, Kael\u2026!\u201dThe sound immediately went to my pelvis at once. The wind revealed the inside of the valley, which should be hidden in the most secret place. In my moment of embarrassment, Kaelus buried his face there.\u201cHa!\u201dThe hot, soft tip of the tongue penetrated the pussy. I felt a completely different sensation from his fingers, and without realizing it, I put strength into my waist.A soft voice.\u201cHere you are. Your scent is the strongest.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dI turned my head suddenly. How can you say such racy words with such a normal face?\u201cWell, that\u2019s enough\u2026 If you don\u2019t get ready\u2026\u201dI raised my trembling hand and pushed Kaelus\u2019 head, which did not fall between my legs. I bit my lips so that I wouldn\u2019t be caught having sexual desire. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll let out a shallow moan.\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dBut overshadowing my efforts, he really caressed me with great care.My hand that pressed down on his head was\u00a0 gradually drained of strength.\u201cUh, stop, stop\u2026!\u201dHot liquid flowed incessantly from the inside.I\u2019m going crazy. I really have to stop, but honestly, I don\u2019t want to stop. I love the pleasure that my favorite gives. My body wants him more than my heart.\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026!\u201dAs he slowly reached his limit, Kaelus finally raised his head with a long sigh.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dHe licked his lips with his red tongue. With that giddy decadence, I could only stare blankly at him.Suddenly he smiled deeply.\u201cI can\u2019t stand it anymore either.\u201dThe stiffly swollen man settled at the entrance of a wet woman. And then.\u201cHa\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh\u2026!\u201dThe pain of an unfamiliar union. But I was willing to endure it.Because this pain is only for a moment, knowing that greater joy will come later.\u201cHa, ha, ha\u2026!\u201dTo the groans of Kaelus, the plop of our genitals made a loud noise on the bed.There was no time to be embarrassed. He\u2019s only a beast with his mouth open and panting.\u201cYes! Oh, yes\u2026! Ugh!\u201dUnable to afford a leisure feast, Kaelus was ferocious from the start. His pushing motion shook my body violently up and down.\u201cHa, ha\u2026! Ha\u2026!\u201d\u201cAh! Ah! Ah! Ha!\u201dWith the goal of reaching our peak quickly, Kaelus and I just gasped like a beast and focused on mating.And finally.\u201cOh my God\u2026!\u201d\u201cAhhhhh!\u201dThe rapturous morning sex came to a halt. The attached man and woman trembled together and soon fell.\u201cHa, ha\u2026\u201dKaelus snorted, sprawled on my chest.\u201cHahaha\u2026 It\u2019s a big deal\u2026 I don\u2019t want to get up\u2026\u201dI held back my tears and hugged Kaelus\u2019 head without saying a word.It was really time to leave.~~~~A carriage from Helios arrived at the front door. Kaelus stood in front of me wearing the kravet I gave him as a wedding gift.The head of the escort saluted him with respect.\u201cHis majesty and the crown prince have ordered you to be safe.\u201d\u201cI should say thank you.\u201dKaelus\u2019 expression was as sober as ever. I couldn\u2019t find the face that was filled with excitement until just now.After loading up all the necessary luggage, he looked back at the duke\u2019s servants in the row.\u201cWhile I\u2019m away, remember that Hestia is your only master.\u201d\u201cYes, my lord.\u201dThe butler Uross replied on behalf of the servants.I was the last person Kaelus greeted just before he got on the wagon.Instead of facing each other, he held me in his arms and whispered in my ear.\u201cDon\u2019t think uselessly, trust me and wait in this house, Hestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t let go of the gift you gave me for a moment. So you should keep thinking about me.\u201d\u201cYes, Kael.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll go straight to bed as soon as I get back, so be prepared.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dHe smiled with satisfaction. Our lips touched lightly and fell apart.\u201cThen I\u2019ll be back.\u201dAfter saying goodbye, Kaelus stepped into the carriage without hesitation.The wheels of the carriage slipped quietly, followed by a mounted manor.But more soldiers were waiting outside the mansion for a carriage with Kaelus in it. Indeed, Helios did not break his promise, but sent Kaelus with elite soldiers on the level of escorting the emperor.\u201c\u2026\u201dNevertheless, there are things that can\u2019t be helped with human resources.I can never sleep comfortably until my favorite returns safely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter Kaelus departed for the border, many letters were sent to the duchy.The content is mainly about successful negotiations and wishing for the safe return of my favorite. Even if it was to send it out of courtesy, I was desperate for him.If more people wish for it, I think \u201cGod\u201d will hear it.I used to think the God of the world was ridiculous, but it changed dramatically.But I didn\u2019t go to the temple with my own feet. The temple has already lost its trust not only to me but also to the general public.Even though Helios did not officially disclose how it was known, Diana\u2019s debt spread to the social circle.Even Erinnis, who acts as the representative of the victims\u2019 group, was very excited.\u201cEven people with a lot of investment experience like me don\u2019t invest that much money in one place at a time!\u201dI sipped my tea and nodded.\u201cBecause she has no experience.\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s not spare money, it\u2019s borrowed money. Oh, my God\u2026\u201dErinnis put her finger to her forehead.I responded calmly.\u201cShe borrowed it from the temple, too. It\u2019s like a year\u2019s budget.\u201d\u201cReally, the more I think about it, the more ridiculous it is, duchess.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026.\u201dModerately replying to Erinnis, but in fact my mind was completely in the left field.At first, Kaelus said that he would send news often, but I refused. It\u2019s much more important for him to finish his work safely and come back unscathed than to try to break the news to me.He told me to wait, so I\u2019ll wait.In the face of things that I can\u2019t do with my own power right now, I have no choice but to stay even if I am powerless.I have to endure it day by day. Even if fear surrounds me like a swamp.\u201cDuchess? Are you okay?\u201dThe sudden call brought me to my senses.\u201cOh, yes, of course. I\u2019m sorry. I was thinking about something else for a second.\u201dErinnis smiled generously at my honest apology.\u201cI understand, Hestia. You\u2019re worried about Duke Kaelus.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI affirmed with a long sigh.Erinnis nodded quietly, and suddenly her eyes shone.\u201cBy the way, duchess. There\u2019s something strange going on in the Lily Palace.\u201d\u201cAt the Lily Palace? Is it the saint again?\u201dDoes Diana have a disease that kills her if she doesn\u2019t get into an accident for a second? Why are you so busy when you\u2019re under arrest in the palace?Erinnis shook her head.\u201cShe\u2019s emphasizing that he\u2019s from the new shrine, and she\u2019s holding a prayer meeting for hours every day in the grand banquet room of the Lily Palace.\u201d\u201cPrayer? For what?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a lot of things. \u2018Let me pay my debts safely, or the return of the Duke Kaelus\u2019.\u201dI\u2019m grateful to hear that, but it\u2019s very uncomfortable to say that it\u2019s Diana.Erinnis clicked her tongue.\u201cI\u2019m glad if it\u2019s a pure heart, but to be honest, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dYeah, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m saying. I have had a throbbing headache.\u201cWhat does she think people say?\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhoa, would she be a crown princess if she knew that? And I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anyone around her who can tell her what\u2019s going on.\u201dErinnis snorted.Diana\u2019s reputation was abysmal, no longer down to earth. She was revered as a saint when she married the crown prince.This was the result of self-isolation, citing beliefs and morality. Now no one acknowledges Diana\u2019s beliefs or believes in her morality.I would be puzzled. Why is this the result even though she lived so hard as an example?Of course everyone but her knows why.Erinnis affirmed.\u201cThe saint may have sought justice, but she didn\u2019t respect people.\u201dI agree with her.And one more thing.Diana failed to realize the extremely basic humility that can only be learned by going through ups and downs in life, due to the flowery path of lady rofan.There is nothing else to say except that it is a misfortune to be a cider heroine.~~~~Harmonia finally cleared up the salon and left for Attica.Before she left, she came to greet me as a duchess.\u201cShouldn\u2019t I stay with the duchess until he comes back\u2026\u201dWith an apologetic face, she blurted out the end of the sentence.I shook my head.\u201cI\u2019m fine, Harmonia. But thank you for your concern.\u201dEven if madam tries to comfort me with words, it\u2019s of no use to me.Instead, I clearly identified what to do in the future.\u201cPlease report the situation in Attica as honestly as possible. It\u2019s better to separate objective facts from madam\u2019s opinions.\u201d\u201cYes, I will not forget what the duchess said.\u201d\u201cThe most important thing madam needs to focus on is to build a positive relationship between Attica\u2019s retainers and myself. I hope you can make the most of your experience in running a salon.\u201dHarmonia smiled.\u201cThank you for giving me such a big role, duchess.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll cheer for Madame\u2019s success.\u201dShe showed me some grace, and left in an energetic manner.~~~~After living and moving for a while, I was empty again.\u201c\u2026\u201dIn order to forget the emptiness, I have no choice but to find something to do and cling to it.What I am most desperate for now is the desperate regret that the heroine abandoned my favorite.Perfectly removed Harmonia from Diana. Not only the mind, but also the physical distance.Completely isolated, she somehow tries to hold onto the leash of Kaelus. By smiling sweetly at him and praying hard for him.But will that solve everything? The world is so easy, right?\u201cYou\u2019re so arrogant because you still have something to rub against.\u201dEven your last crown princess seat will be in jeopardy, so you\u2019ll see. Diana.I\u2019ll let you fall to your feet. To the point where you have to kneel desperately.I\u2019ll take everything away.~~~~On a rainy day.The open terrace was full of rain. I couldn\u2019t taste anything in the soup I nibbled on.\u201cI really don\u2019t have any taste in my mouth\u2026\u201dWhen I lost my appetite, Clarice was very worried.\u201cI\u2019m worried about your health. Why don\u2019t you see the doctor?\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201dWhat\u2019s the point of stubbornly refusing? I accepted the examination with a grain of salt.However, the doctor also tilted his head.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with you\u2026\u201d\u201cThen why can\u2019t she eat as much?\u201dClarice criticized the doctor for nothing.The doctor sighed.\u201cWorry is the root of all illnesses. She\u2019s lost your appetite now, and if it continues, it\u2019ll get worse everywhere.\u201d\u201cPlease prescribe something, sir!\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s just\u2026 Master needs to come back soon\u2026\u201dI smiled faintly as I watched the conversation between the lady-in-waiting and the doctor.\u201cThe doctor is right, Clarice.\u201d\u201cMadam\u2026\u201d\u201cI need to get some shut-eye for a second. I\u2019ll feel better after I sleep.\u201dThe lady-in-waiting and the doctor looked at me pitifully.\u201cTake a good rest, madam.\u201dSoon the room was quiet.~~~~I laid sprawling on the sofa.I\u2019m definitely not starving. Even if it\u2019s a little bit, I\u2019m always eating something, but strangely, my whole body is weak.\u201cIs the pain the same as before the return\u2026?\u201dI thought it was because I gave up on my health before I returned, but what if it wasn\u2019t?Even if I took good care of myself, I\u2019m destined to get sick anyway. But didn\u2019t he say there was nothing wrong when he examined me a little while ago?\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201dI laughed weakly.Since it\u2019s not really painful anywhere, as the doctor said, it must be a symptom that will disappear only when Kaelus comes home.\u201cCoffee is not good either\u2026\u201dI keep talking to myself like a lost person. It feels like the mouth is moving without going through the brain.I really feel like I need to take a nap.Thinking so, I slowly lifted myself up.Then.\u201cMadam? Are you sleeping?\u201dIt\u2019s the voice of the butler Uross. I answered, sitting up straight.\u201cNo, come on in.\u201dThe door opened quietly and Uross appeared with a slightly nervous look.\u201cYou have a visitor to see you.\u201d\u201cHmm? Didn\u2019t I announce that I\u2019m refusing visitors for a while?\u201d\u201cYes, I did, but the person who came to see you\u2026\u201dI noticed for a moment when I saw him trailing the end of his words.There is only one high-ranking official who can defy the will of the duchess.\u201cIs it Hyperion?\u201dWhen asked, the butler affirmed with a strange face.\u201cYou don\u2019t need any other explanation, ma\u2019am.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not very happy to see him, but I can\u2019t ignore him because he came through the rain. Take him here.\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201dSince Helios came undercover in secret, it was impossible to greet him in the drawing room.After a while, Helios appeared quietly with the butler.\u201cWelcome, Hyperion.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA face that doesn\u2019t show much expression.Why did I come all the way here in such a bad weather? I tried to roll my head in a daze because I was out of energy.\u201cDid anything special happen at the border?\u201d\u201cNot yet.\u201dThen what?Helios frowned slightly, as if my expression was quite disrespectful.\u201cThat\u2019s a sight. One might even wonder if Duchess Hestia was right.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt doesn\u2019t matter if the screw is loose or not, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.\u201cI\u2019m surprised you\u2019re so cold-hearted that you\u2019re so exhausted just because your husband is away for a while.\u201dWhat do you mean? What a bummer.I shook my head with excitement.\u201cYou don\u2019t know how much I feel for my husband. It is deeply doubtful whether his highness, who fervently wooed his saint, is correct.\u201dI echoed what he said.Surprisingly, he smirked.\u201cThat\u2019s more like you now.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s rather annoying.When you don\u2019t want to think about it, it\u2019s best to ask directly.\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d\u201cI want to ask you something.\u201dI stared at Helios. He rarely averted his eyes.\u201c\u2026What you said that day\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026? \u2026!\u201dI wondered what the hell he was talking about, until the memory came to mind slowly.\u201cOh, you mean the day I told you I\u2019d quit my job as an aide?\u201dHelios nodded hesitatingly for some reason.\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dI laughed bitterly at the question that was finally solved.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to blame me for my disrespect, I\u2019ll take it sweetly.\u201d\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201dOh, I see. Then you won\u2019t mind if I relax my posture.I leaned on the sofa and opened my mouth.\u201cI can\u2019t believe you don\u2019t care about my disrespect.\u201dDid you say that in front of Kael because you felt a sense of futility? You must have forgotten your past fighting with Kaelus over Diana. What about the night of the dinner, you swore you\u2019d never be greedy for Kaelus\u2019 again.Just go and pay attention to your wife is praying for someone else\u2019s husband. Don\u2019t spend time with other people\u2019s wives.I had a lot to say back to Helios, but I just kept it to myself.Honestly, right now, I don\u2019t have the energy to take it out.\u201cMy words didn\u2019t mean anything else at the time. You can take it literally.\u201d\u201cFor that matter, your condition was extraordinary.\u201dHelios seemed determined not to fall for it.What I wanted to ask just popped out without going through the brain.\u201cWhat do you think I was like?\u201dHe answered after a moment\u2019s hesitation.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve never seen you tremble like that before.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHow can I explain that?I\u2019m not sure I can say I\u2019m confused because I don\u2019t know where my reality is right now because I\u2019m a fan from outside the book.You wouldn\u2019t believe it if I told you.I should give a reasonably convincing answer.What should I do?\u201c\u2026When a competent person loses their ability, they are as embarrassed as such.\u201dOh, yeah. This should do it.In the golden eyes that looked at me, I continued with an expressionless face.\u201cThere is a difference between what you know in your head and what you actually experience. Even if I knew in advance that my prophecies would disappear, I was afraid because it really disappeared.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026?\u201dLooking at the tapering golden eyes, I continued without stopping.\u201cYes, her highness will be the same. She must have been very confused because the healing power she thought was natural has disappeared. So, her judgment became blurred\u2026 Isn\u2019t that the case?\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dHelios was getting more and more \u00a0 expressionless. He didn\u2019t seem to be easily convinced.But what can I do? Even if he doesn\u2019t believe it, I have no intention of explaining it more kindly.After saying that, I shut up.Now, if you got what you want, go back.\u201c\u2026Okay. If you say so, I won\u2019t ask you any more.\u201d\u201cI thank you, your grace.\u201dI\u2019m going to answer right away.\u201cBut this time you answer honestly.\u201d\u201c?\u201dWhy are you coming on so strong?The golden eyes of Helios shone sharply.\u201cIt\u2019s strange, I guess. Your prediction is generally accurate to the point of time, but it\u2019s quite different now from when you predicted that your ability would disappear.\u201dWow, it\u2019s not easy.How could you remember that I said that I would lose my ability in about two years and doubt the time difference from the actual date of my resignation.\u201cI\u2019ll ask you honestly. Is there any prophecy you haven\u2019t told me yet?\u201dAh, you\u2019re still greedy.I wondered why you were worried about me, and as expected, there was a real purpose.I\u2019m tired. I\u2019ve dealt with a situation when I don\u2019t have any energy.I should get it done quickly and let it go.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. At that time, I had a piece of prophecy that I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d accept.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dHelios glared at me as if it were ridiculous.\u201cI trusted the prophecies to be honest and made you my aide, but as expected!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll understand my judgment when you hear it. I have long known that your highnesses will be estranged almost like a stranger.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cIt was before you two got this bad. How can I you that in such a situation?\u201d\u201cWhoo\u2026\u201dA deep sigh of anger from the male lead.I\u2019m losing my strength too. Now I have a headache. I guess it\u2019s more so because I barely ate anything.If you\u2019re done, please go. Yes?\u201cThen it means that we\u2019ll just be like strangers, and Diana will still be the crown princess, right?\u201dIt\u2019s not over yet.I stopped holding my temples because of the buzzing headache.I\u2019m choking up with annoyance. An answer that pops out again without thinking about it.\u201cOh, well, until I died, the saintess was still the crown princess.\u2026\u201d\u201c!\u201dAn instantaneous freeze of air.\u201c\u2026!\u201dAnd I realized that I made a mistake one beat later than Helios.Damn it.I\u2019m doomed.My brain stopped because I had no energy.\u201cBefore death?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.\u201dIt is actually extremely exhausting to hold on to the questioning. I\u2019ve told Kaelus once anyway, so let\u2019s just tell Helios.\u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve told my husband before. I think the reason I\u2019m losing my ability is probably because I\u2019m dying.\u201d\u201cKael knows?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI shrank weakly. Damn.However, Helios\u2019 eyes were filled with force.\u201cDon\u2019t lie. I told you to be honest.\u201d\u201cYour bighness, I\u2019m not lying\u2026\u201d\u201cDiana was a crown princess until \u2018before I died\u2019? Does that mean you\u2019ve already died once?\u201d\u201c!\u201dCrazy.What is it?Why are you so sharp?\u201cOh, it must be true. This is it. This is the truth, Hestia.\u201dHelios laughed in vain.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a prophecy! It was all real events. Until you died!\u201dSeriously, I can\u2019t think of anything.I should have eaten well. I should have replenished my energy earlier.Why did you make such a fatal mistake in front of a fox who never lets his guard down?Why do I have so many holes?\u201cYour Highness, to Kaelus\u2026\u201dMy voice is so unsightly that it sounds like it\u2019s crawling.\u201c\u2026 Let me tell him. I won\u2019t hide it, I\u2019ll tell him myself.\u201dThen, a fierce question comes.\u201cWhat? You\u2019re not really a prophet? That you\u2019re back in the past after death?\u201d\u201cEverything, everything\u2026\u201dIf I tell myself the truth, will Kaelus be as angry as Helios?Would I be able to lie naturally if I could think?\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m so sorry\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, don\u2019t apologize, Hestia! I\u2019m not angry right now!\u201d\u201c?\u201dI stiffened up and looked at Helios.Helios, who seemed to be at a loss, ruffled his black hair again and again.\u201cYou can change it, right?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026?\u201dHe looked back at me ferociously.\u201cYou can change it! You could\u2019ve changed some of the things you\u2019ve said so far, in your\u00a0 prophecies! Isn\u2019t that right?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s fifty-fifty.Kaelus\u2019 death was prevented, but Diana\u2019s loss of power was not prevented. The empire prevented the war crisis, but it did not prevent Baron Potos from sinking the merchant ship.There is a past that can be changed and a past that does not change.Which of them is my destiny.\u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201dI said frankly.Then he gripped my arm with an angry force.\u201cUgh\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou have to change it! If you don\u2019t know how, come up with it! What do you want me to do with Kael? The guy barely survived thanks to you\u2026!\u201dI frowned with throbbing pain.\u201cI\u2019m not worried about Kael\u2026\u201d\u201cThis\u2026!\u201dHelios tried to shout something more but stopped. Instead, he let go of my arm that he was holding in pain.\u201cThe reason you died\u2026 What was it\u2026?\u201dHis voice has softened up a lot. Helios seems a little bit genuine now.I retorted, rubbing my arm gently.\u201cI think I\u2019m sick\u2026\u2026 I\u2019m not sure. I didn\u2019t get any treatment.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dWhy is he in such a hurry to answer with an immediate question?\u201cI didn\u2019t want to live.\u201d\u201cWhy\u2026?\u201dNow it\u2019s 20 questions.By the way, I think I\u2019m slowly getting out of panic. Seeing that you\u2019re coming up with useless words.I tilted my head and looked at Helios.\u201cBecause Kaelus was dead. Because of you and Diana.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI shrugged my shoulders at Helios, who had hardened.\u201cSo as soon as I returned, I saved Kaelus first. The rest is as you have seen.\u201dLaughing in vain.\u201cNow you\u2019re getting the pieces together, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dLeaving him standing stunned, I dragged my feet up to the terrace.\u201cIt\u2019s not just love. My feelings for Kael.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cKael is my life itself. You can\u2019t compare it to a shallow love\u2026\u201dI bent my eyes and laughed.\u201cI think you\u2019ve got all the answers you want, your highness?\u201dThe golden eyes full of emotion headed towards me.\u201cDid you say you got sick and died?\u201d\u201cYeah, well\u2026 to be honest, I guess that\u2019s the case. I was definitely sick in the months before I died.\u201d\u201cWhen?\u201dI noticed what he wanted to ask. There was a sudden smirk of laughter.\u201cJust around this time of the year?\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201cBut you don\u2019t have to worry. My doctor examined me this morning and said I was fine.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send a doctor tomorrow.\u201d\u201cWhy would you? The duke\u2019s doctor is also known for his name.\u201d\u201cThe more people who do it, the more accurate it will be.\u201dHelios continued to be stubborn.It\u2019s funny to wrestle with something like this. Let\u2019s just let it happen.\u201cWhoa, do as you please.\u201dI leaned against the terrace door and replied.~~~~I stared blankly out of the terrace.Helios\u2019 carriage was leaving through the thinning rain.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dAfter an emotional ride on the roller coaster, I can\u2019t think of anything like my mind is completely empty.\u201cIt\u2019s driving me crazy.\u2026.\u201dHelios is like a fox.How can I pick up the fact that I\u2019m a regressor when I just made a mistake?It\u2019s ridiculous and I can\u2019t help but laugh.\u201cHa\u2026 but I didn\u2019t get caught being a possessor\u2026\u201dIf the conversation had been prolonged a little longer, J might have been caught as a possessor by leaking clues.Helios is a human being who will know enough.Anyway, Helios found out one of the secrets I was going to take to the grave.I don\u2019t want to make secrets between Helios and myself even if I die.Therefore, my secret to Helios must be told the same to Kaelus.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dIn fact, it\u2019s dark in front of us.Whatever the content, I\u2019m worried that I have to reveal the fact that I\u2019ve been hiding something all along the way.There is no way that it is not unpleasant. You must feel betrayed.Whatever excuse I make, it\u2019s an immovable truth that I lied to him.I murmured to myself.\u201cI lied to you that I\u2019m good at predicting things. I\u2019m actually a regressor.\u201dPractice speaking without stuttering in practice.I should either get in shape quickly before making a mistake or even refuse to visit Hyperion.I couldn\u2019t even eat a bowl of soup properly and greeted a fox-like person, so truth came out for a long time.No, but that means I\u2019m screwed.As I\u2019m certain that I\u2019ll achieve my goal, my mind has become relaxed. Even though I shouldn\u2019t relax until the end.But this doesn\u2019t change anything.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I\u2019m a prophet or a regressor. Only Diana needs to kneel down anyway.\u201dWhen your head is complicated and things get twisted, you have to go back to the beginning.What I wanted in the beginning. I thought for the heroine to desperately regret it.All of the advantages gained through the impersonation and regression are only means to this, and it means that it is not my ultimate goal to firmly hide itself.The unexpected unexpected situation has made my mind a little painful, but fundamentally, the goal I want to pursue does not disappear.It remains the same in the future as it has been.I will punish Diana and make Kaelus happy.~~~~The next day, a real imperial doctor appeared in the mansion.\u201cHis highness the crown prince sent me. He is very concerned about your health.\u201d\u201cOh, yes\u2026.\u201dThe duke\u2019s doctor, who was unaware of the context, looked at me with a strange expression. I shook my head still. It means you have to understand because there\u2019s nothing you can do.Eventually, the palace began to examine me as our doctor watched.\u201cUm\u2026\u201dI asked in a blunt way on behalf of our doctor, who would have been upset.\u201cEverything\u2019s fine, right?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dSee? It\u2019s the same. My doctor and I shrugged.But thanks to you, I thought of a good business. An idea that came to mind when I saw the group of doctors gathered.As more and more people doubted the purity of the temple, some of the lower ranks were also slowly leaving the temple.The most passionate and pure group are those who have just become ranked. Therefore, when they found out that the temple was pursuing the secular world more than anyone else, they began to question the direction of the temple they believed in.The main role of the new shrine is poor relief and medical practice. What I especially noticed was this medical sector.Since the imperial palace doctor is here, let\u2019s ask him.\u201cThere are quite a few courtiers from the new shrine, right?\u201d\u201cYes, some were apprenticed under the doctor of the aristocratic family, and others entered the imperial palace after practicing medicine as a retainer.\u201d\u201cHow are the courtiers from the new shrine doing?\u201dTo my question, the imperial palace doctor stretched his chest and answered with a gesture of pride.\u201cWhether they\u2019re a priest or an apprentice, once they\u2019ve entered the palace; it means they have the best ability in the empire, duchess.\u201dNext to him, the duke\u2019s doctor held back his laughter. I didn\u2019t want the answer either, but his expression was so serious that I couldn\u2019t say anything.Anyway, the palace finished its mission and returned safely to the palace.It is better to visualize the inspiration that pops into your head as soon as possible. This is because only then will it develop from the level of 'sudden thoughts\u201d to \u201cexecutable ideas.\u201dThe first thing to do is to bring in medical talents who have left the temple before their skills are rusted.I immediately called the butler and instructed him.\u201cI\u2019ll have to put up a notice in the downtown square. We need to gather people who have learned medicine. Especially those from the new shrine.\u201d\u201cAll right, ma\u2019am.\u201dUross\u2019 work is always reliable.After gathering talent in this way, a general clinic will be created to ensure that medical practice is completely separated from the temple. It is also a good idea to set up a medical school to train more skilled professional doctors.If the honor of the temple is ruined, then the function of the temple will dry up.I will peel off the package and blow out the foam. Remove everything except the kernel.\u201cNo more, let\u2019s go back to God.\u201dTime to return to the original role of the temple.I hope they will return to their original intentions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 41": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAgain, it was best to concentrate on work to forget unnecessary worries.The inspiration that came to mind on the day the courtier visited was put into practice, and in an instant, things to do snowballed.Uross followed my instructions steadily. He posted a notice on the bulletin board on the main street during the day.The story is that \u201cThe Duchess Hestia is looking for a medical talent.\u201dThe reaction was very immediate. From that night on, letters began to fly right in front of me.\u201cUh\u2026\u201dI gulped down the nutritional juice put in by the maid, Clarice.After Helios left, I decided to force myself to eat a lot even if I had no appetite.Damn it, I shouldn\u2019t be too lazy to nourish myself so that I don\u2019t get hit twice by that jerk.I experienced the fact that if I don\u2019t eat, I don\u2019t have energy, and if I don\u2019t have energy, my thoughts leak. What a nasty lesson it was.I called in the doctor and sat next to him.\u201cLet\u2019s go over the papers together, sir.\u201d\u201cYes, Duchess\u2026\u201dI heard a groan somewhere, but I decided to coolly ignore it.The people who sent the letters certainly came from the new shrine. In recent years, some people quit the shrine, and some people quit quite a long time ago and engaged in other jobs.I asked my doctor secretly.\u201cAre there any of them skilled enough to teach others?\u201d\u201cWell, some people stand out.\u201dThe reason why common people had no choice but to visit the temple even if they hated it was because there were no suitable places other than the temple where they could receive treatment at a low price.We must make sure that no one looks at the temple. In order to do so, even if you don\u2019t visit the temple, there must be no difficulty in your daily life.\u201cLet\u2019s sort out the people who can start the treatment right away.\u201d\u201cYou have to divide it into two categories. Ma\u2019am, it\u2019s better to separate those who can see you in person from those who can only assist you.\u201d\u201cOh, yes.\u201dYou should always listen to what the professional says. I immediately accepted the doctor\u2019s suggestion.Soon after, the butler was also called to my room.\u201cI need to buy a building with a lot of rooms. It should be available as a clinic.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am. I\u2019ll find out as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cOh, and look for another building. Uross. This time, a good place to be a training camp.\u201dUross took notes of my instructions and nodded.\u201cI\u2019ll pick a few suitable candidates. Why don\u2019t you choose one out of them?\u201d\u201cOkay, that\u2019s much better.\u201dHe is also a good worker, so he proceeds with what to do without me instructing him one by one.The doctor smiled softly.\u201cIt would be better for you to be busy than free.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dTo be honest, I wish I was much busier than this. One might lament that it is a disaster that was brought to you, but I want to get busier and forget the anxiety and loneliness that permeates.\u201cWell, let\u2019s read the next letter.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dThe doctor sighed and picked up the thick glasses again.~~~~Because of the huge notice on the bulletin board of the downtown area, the business within the city quickly became known in the social circles.And surprisingly, this time the temple responded.A lengthy protest before me. In summary, however, it ended in one sentence.\u201cWhat? How dare you trample on God\u2019s authority?\u201dNo, since when has medicine been a thing of the temple? So all the doctors of the aristocracy are sinners who ignore God? What about the palace?\u201cWow\u2026 I guess I\u2019m doing it right because the temple is angry. I should continue to do this. Hmph.\u201dI gritted my teeth with a snort.That arrogance will be over when the complaint comes out to the world soon. It\u2019s too late to regret after the decapitation.However, there is a reason why the temple is so sensitive. This is because after the duke\u2019s notice was hung, the young retainers of the temple began to stir.In fact, many of the letters that arrived at me were from the retainers who still belonged to the temple. In many cases, they were secretly sent away by holding them to the side of visitors to the temple, avoiding strict ministers.In fact, my notice did not promise any treatment of medical personnel.Nevertheless, this agitation can be seen as meaning that young priests are not already very attracted to the temple.Then is it all the more my fault for the departure of the young priests? It\u2019s the owner\u2019s fault for not taking care of the rabbits!\u201cYou\u2019re always busy blaming others.\u201dI clicked my tongue and threw the temple protest into the fire.~~~~Before long, the butler, Uross, held out a few documents before me.\u201cWe have distinguished between ready-to-use buildings and buildings that require some repairs, madam.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dI took a close look at the list that Uross summarized. Soon after, the doctor, who had been called in, began to pick the right place with me.\u201cThe mansion was used for residential purposes, but there are many large spaces such as banquet rooms and dining halls. If it\u2019s well-decorated, it will be a good clinic.\u201d\u201cWell, how about this one? It was used as an academy in the past, but it has been empty for several years. I think we can use it as a training center if we just fix it.\u201d\u201cOh, that would be fine, madam.\u201dWe ranked the candidates appropriately. If I failed to get a candidate that is on the priority list, I can move on to the next one.It was disadvantageous to drag on too long. Since the duke\u2019s servants had already been poking around looking for things, there was a concern that landlords would call the price high if rumors spread that they were buying buildings from the duke.I hurried to get ready to go out. And I decided to accompany the doctor because I needed more perspective from the field worker than myself, an amateur.All real estate transactions must be checked at the site before signing a contract.\u201cIt\u2019s wider than I expected. Hmm\u2026\u201d\u201cThe wider one is more useful than the narrower one. Ma\u2019am, I think it\u2019s a good idea to convert this mansion into a clinic.\u201d\u201cOkay, it\u2019s good enough to isolate the infectious disease patients.\u201dIt was decided that the mansion, which was formerly the residence of a certain family, would be reborn as a private clinic.Meanwhile, a large building, an old academy, was left empty for a long time because it could not find a suitable owner. So before I actually looked around, I was worried that it might have been too old.However, when I looked at it with my eyes, it was not as shabby as I thought.\u201cIf it is repaired, it will last long enough, madam.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. It\u2019s not easy to find another suitable place to gather people and teach them at once.\u201dWhen I expressed my intention to purchase the building to the owner of the old academy, he quickly signed the contract without thinking twice. It seems that he has been suffering from difficulties in dealing with it.Thanks to this quick movement, we were able to successfully purchase the building without any interruptions.\u201cSir, The duchess will be busy looking at people, but please quickly create a list of picks that you need to fill in at this clinic.\u201d\u201cHahaha, leave it to me. Ma\u2019am, I\u2019m really looking forward to this business.\u201dThere is no one who will not devote themselves o a well-motivated task. Therefore, I was able to leave the details to my doctor with confidence.The establishment of the clinic was quiet and proceeded very quickly.I decided to meet the former priests who sent me the letter in person.Even if they left the temple, they could still have a devout faith. However, I decided not to set \u2018maintaining faith\u2019 as a condition of working together.What I want is proper working ability, not having the same ideas as me. In addition, to separate temple and medical practice as I aimed, I needed to be free from this problem first.\u201cMorothy, we\u2019ll have a meeting at the duchy\u2026\u201dI invited them to the duchy, replying to each of the selected letters. Although it is in the form of a group interview, it was actually not necessary to pick more out of here, so it had to be seen as a kind of meeting.\u201cWhew, as expected, we have to be quick. That way, we won\u2019t give them* time to fight back.\u201d*TN: the templeIt was too late to try to do so. I can\u2019t wait for the day the bomb explodes.So.\u201cCome back soon, Kael\u2026\u201dI was able to endure a little because I pushed myself so hard to be busy on purpose.Still, his absence is frightening and disturbing.The only reason I live in this world.I can\u2019t wait for my favorite to come back to my side.~~~~I\u2019ve filled up my day a little too much. To forget the anxiety and fear that appeared like a ghost, I had to concentrate on something.The doctor\u2019s examination was also done every morning. One thing that bothered me was sending Helios a daily report of the examination.\u201cHis Highness is quite interested in your health\u2026\u201dSince I sent him to the palace, it is natural that the doctor thinks so.\u201cPhew, he seems to want to relieve himself of what he owes Kael.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dFor the duke, Helios and Diana\u2019s marriage was a pretty complicated affair. So my doctor agreed with me without much explanation.It\u2019s about time to wrap up the examination with the opinion that there\u2019s nothing wrong today.\u201cMadam! I got a call from the border!\u201d\u201c?!\u201dThe butler, Uross, rushed in.I snatched a letter from him and opened it quickly.\u201cThe negotiations ended successfully\u2026! We\u2019re leaving soon\u2026\u201d\u201cOh!\u201dMy favorite kept the war at bay.Now all you have to do is come back safely.~~~~Kaelus\u2019 short letter really said, \u201cThe negotiations ended successfully,\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re leaving soon.\u201dAnd the rest of the words that I didn\u2019t read to the servants.<I can\u2019t wait to see you.>\u201c\u2026\u201dIn the room where the doctor and the butler left me alone, I wiped away the moisture from my eyes.\u201cWhoa, I\u2019m so blessed\u2026\u201dI think I\u2019m already loved by him more than Diana.All the sweet words that were only told to Diana in the original novel are now directed at me.Not only the favorite and the heart but also the body were united. Indeed, as he wished, we are even closer to a \u2018true couple\u2019.\u201cA married couple\u2026 who spend the rest of their lives together\u2026.\u201dBut it still feels very strange to me.In the first place, I never thought I would live in this world until I got old and died. This is a novel for now, and I never recognized it as a reality where I would stay forever.However, I didn\u2019t really look for my way back. When I woke up one day, the world had changed, so I had a vague idea that it would be the same when I went back.If I can\u2019t go back to my original world anyway, I may have to make my life here somehow until then.\u201cBut\u2026 I\u2019ve never thought about how to live my life in a novel\u2026\u201dI murmured with a vague feeling.The character I possessed was also an extra without presence. My identity was not more than a thoroughly fanatical reader.It was no different because it was a world where Kaelus died and didn\u2019t exist. Since the will to live had already disappeared, why would I have had to make my life there?I was just living because I couldn\u2019t die. In the meantime, I was too scared to take my own life like my favorite.What was I afraid of? The answer was simple.I\u2019m afraid the moment I die will hurt so much.The biggest concern was just how much physical pain it would be. I hesitated because I was afraid it would be painful as soon as I touched the ground if I jumped, and hesitated because I would be suffocated if I fell into the water.So I couldn\u2019t die. Funnily enough.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dIsn\u2019t it ridiculous? Even though moments of life are constantly painful, the pain you feel right away when you\u2019re about to die is the biggest obstacle.However, thanks to that, even if there is a \u201cI don\u2019t want to live,\u201d I may continue my life steadily instead of dying in anger.After living like that, I\u2019ve returned like this.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe truth is I\u2019m not confident.There is nothing more to be learned from the fanatic notes. From now on, Hestia in this novel must live with the foundation she was born with.If Kaelus liked me because of the cheat key I\u2019ve used so far.\u201c\u2026What should I do\u2026?\u201dOf course, he never told me why, but I never asked him outright.Why does he want me to be his true companion.\u201cWell, to be honest, I\u2019m a lot better than Diana\u2026 Hehe\u2026.\u201dBut with that logic, maybe there\u2019s someone else in the world better than me.Can I fit in well with Kaelus, who has done everything and has nothing anymore?Will I be accepted as a member of this world when I have not made my life affectionately* and have lived looking at everyone around me as a convenient tool to use?*TN: she didn\u2019t appreciate her lifeDo I admit to myself that it is okay to live in this works for decades more?Are I prepared to accept this place as my whole reality?\u201cUm\u2026\u201dTo be honest, I am very afraid.But it\u2019s worth the courage to do it.If I could spend my whole life receiving the love of my favorite in the world.If we can live happily with a smile without losing him again.Then this will be my new reality, and I will no longer be a common and ordinary rofan reader, but as the Duchess Hestia.\u201cPhew, but I have to tell my favorite first.\u201dThere is still one mountain to climb between Kael and me.It\u2019s about my ability and my identity that Helios had discovered. I confessed that I was not a visionary, but a regressor.It doesn\u2019t matter whether I was a visionary or a regressor.The issue of this matter is that I have lied to Kaelus from the beginning.Will Kaelus accept me like this?Will he be able to maintain his trust in someone like me?\u201cWhoa, let\u2019s talk. You won\u2019t know until you talk to him!\u201dTo know the answer,I have no choice but to pluck up the courage.~~~~I started the day with a tight schedule as usual.\u201cToday, I\u2019m going to go check how much progress has been made in repairing the building.\u201dThen Clarice, who brought the coffee, carefully spoke.\u201cBut isn\u2019t today the day master arrives in the capital?\u201d\u201cKaelus will stop by the palace first. He has to report the outcome of the negotiations to His Majesty.\u201d\u201cBut\u2026\u201dI grinned on purpose.\u201cThere\u2019s too much to do all day.\u201dI said this, but in fact, as Clarice said, my heart was about to explode after waiting for Kaelus all day long.I\u2019m relieved that he\u2019s back safely.The excitement of meeting him soon.And fear before confessing the truth to him.If I don\u2019t do anything, I\u2019ll be suffocated by all kinds of emotions.I\u2019ll try my best to be myself and be brave.Didn\u2019t I worry before Kaelus left? I mean, I\u2019m not as energetic as I usually am.Therefore, it must be clearly demonstrated that the concern was a quirk. To do this, even if it is annoying, I have no choice but to distract my nerves by doing other things.\u201cI\u2019ll be back, Clarice.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am\u2026.\u201dThe lady-in-waiting nodded reluctantly.~~~~I stayed outside until late in the afternoon.The old academy building had been empty for a long time, even though the framework was strong, so there were many old corners all over the place. The workers seemed quite nervous when I came out and checked the status of the work.I said with a smile on my face.\u201cPlease be careful not to cause any defects in the future.\u201d\u201cYes! Duchess!\u201dThe working class leader replied in a voice full of shouts.Then I headed to the mansion for the clinic. It could be used immediately if it was cleaned neatly, so the priests from the duchy were working with beads of sweat.\u201cGet plenty of rest while working, everyone.\u201d\u201cThank you, ma\u2019am!\u201dSince they are from the same family, I ask them much more gently.When I returned home after finishing all my business, I made the carriage run slowly.\u201cUgh\u2026 I\u2019m nervous\u2026\u201dAs I got closer to home, tension that tightened my heart appeared again. The urge to stay outside a little longer and go in is soaring.But no. Because Kaelus told me to wait \u2018at home\u2019 just before he left.Even if I go outside to forget the tension and anxiety, I should go back and greet Kaelus \u2018at home\u2019 in time.I finally got off at the front door of the mansion with my pounding heart.\u201cMadam!\u201dAs soon as I arrived, Uross came running like a baby.\u201cIt\u2019s time for master to arrive soon. I got a call a long time ago that he\u2019s coming home after refusing to have an imperial dinner.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dIt\u2019s supposed to be an emperor\u2019s dinner, but you don\u2019t want to! Even though Kaelus is a duke, is that okay?\u201cAnyway, ma\u2019am, it\u2019s about to\u2026\u201dBut before Uross\u2019 words were finished, loud carriage wheels were heard from outside.\u201c\u2026!\u201dI couldn\u2019t move from the spot and looked at the front door, with my pale face.The sound of the carriage, which was ringing like thunder in my ears, stopped. Then I heard the door open.The sound of shoes hitting the floor.The butler plodded along and opened the porch.\u201c\u2026\u201dI closed my eyes tightly for a moment.Then, slowly, I opened my eyes again.\u201c\u2026Hess.\u201dThe brilliant silver-haired Kaelus appeared before me like a mirage.It\u2019s a rather shabby appearance from a long trip, but it didn\u2019t hide the brilliance of my favorite.Oh, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re okay.\u201cDid you just arrive?\u201dIt was only then that I could smile.Kaelus rushed to meet me after completing the task given by the emperor.How could I refuse his hand?\u201cHestia.\u201dAs soon as I held his hand, a strong grip clasped my hand.Kaelus began to climb the stairs without saying a word. I was caught by him and had no choice but to follow him.We climbed completely up the corridor connecting to our rooms.\u201c!\u201dHis pace seemed to accelerate little by little, but he couldn\u2019t hold back a few steps and ran at all.The bedroom door of Kaelus opens with a roar.We ran in, holding hands.\u201c\u2026!\u2019\u201cHmm\u2026!\u201dBefore I could confirm that the door was closed, Kaelus swallowed my lips roughly.A deep nostalgic scent.A burning desire.The intense emotions that I could feel from body contact melted my whole body, which had been frozen with tension, all at once.\u201cHa, ha\u2026.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026Kael\u2026\u201dIt was not until I was out of breath that our joint lips came up for air.The red lips smiled with a captivating curve.\u201cWell, as promised.\u201d\u201c!\u201dI fell down on the bed as if I was being pushed. And a waterfall of silver covered my vision.A frank conversation of the body, with nothing to hide.It didn\u2019t matter at this moment because Kaelus, whom I had missed so much with anxiety, was holding me without washing up first.I held Kaelus\u2019 face tightly in my hands. My lips were frantically searching for his lips.I have to feel his breath right under my nose. I have to confirm with his breathing and body temperature that he has returned to me safely.\u201cHess. Hess\u2026!\u201dKaelus called me by my name and gave me his lips willingly. I jumped into it as if I were a desperate beast running for water.I hugged him, almost clinging to his arms. Unable to control my overflowing affection, I hugged him and gave him strength. Smiling, our position on the bed was reversed.Now he\u2019s lying under me. He smiled brightly.\u201cHug me.\u201dI followed him with a full smile.\u201cGladly.\u201dNo more words were needed.I lifted myself up slightly. In front of Kaelus, I pulled back my skirt and threw off my underwear myself. With my lower body exposed, I sat lightly on his thigh this time. I boldly touched his bottom. A nice belt ornament was dragged out of my hand.Only then did his penis stand up proudly.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIn ecstasy, I licked the pole from the root to the top. A faint groan escaped from somewhere.\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dThe blood vessels wound around the penis swelled up. I carefully lifted my pelvis and set it on top of it. And slowly, very slowly, I lowered myself.\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dA foreign object broke into my body. A painful groan came up automatically, but I endured and swallowed.I can\u2019t allow a man who\u2019s traveled a long way to move. Now is the time for me to quench his thirst.\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201dI took a breath for a moment with my hand on his chest.\u201cHess\u2026 it\u2019s okay\u2026?\u201dTo Kaelus, who was struggling to ask, I replied with a smile.\u201cI\u2019m fine\u2026. You stay still\u2026. I\u2026 I\u2026 I\u2019ll do it\u2026.\u201dAs long as my favorite is happy, I can do anything.I moved my pelvis slowly, which I swallowed up to the root. In a circle, as smooth as possible. As if embracing the loveliest thing in the world, with sincerity.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026.\u201dA little exclamation broke out. I put my reason aside for a while and followed my senses for a moment in wriggling as if I were a creature of my own will. I instinctively shook my waist, so that it could touch my most sensitive spot.\u201cHa, ha\u2026!\u201dThe silver eyelashes that stretched through Cylus\u2019 closed eyes trembled.\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dMy heart was filled with indescribable joy. How sexy his expression is when he enjoys sexual harassment. This is a privilege that only I can enjoy.I leaned forward and hugged him. His heart beat directly on my chest. The sound of his truly living breathing reached my ears.Alas, I can be sure now. My favorite is really alive and well and in my arms. As promised to me.His arm gently wrapped around my back. A sighing voice.\u201cHess\u2026 I missed you\u2026\u201dI caressed his face and hair fondly. And in response to his confession, my vagina, containing the penis, tightened as much as it could. His fine eyebrows twisted in an instant.\u201cHuh\u2026!\u201dI laughed silently. This is what makes a man happy.Whenever he, who has always been neat, is disturbed little by little, a mean desire slowly blooms. After lifting my pelvis slightly, I dropped it with force.\u201cHaaaaah!Kaelus, who responded quickly. Before I knew it, I felt a tingling sensation. One more time on my ass.\u201cOh my gosh!\u201d\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dIn a moment, a sharp electric current ran through my head. It\u2019s stuck tight. My lips opened by themselves.\u201cHa\u2026 ha\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh my\u2026!\u201dAlas. As much as I want, I stabbed the spear where I wanted it. An indescribable pleasure spread throughout the body. The pleasure of staying in my body for a very long time, both crumpled and relaxed.\u201cGasp, gasp, gasp\u2026!\u201dA silver-haired handsome man groaning under me.\u201cWhoa, whoa, whoa\u2026!\u201dAt this moment, I have everything.I dug deep into his lips. He immediately circled my tongue. The satisfaction of owning him entirely as mine. I feel awfully good.I raised my upper body again. Then, as if he had done it to me, I hit it back with force.**TN: as in she slammed down. She didn\u2019t hit herself\u201cHa\u2026! Oh! Ah\u2026\u2026!\u201dA coy groan broke out. The sensation of a thick pillar pushing through my skin is thrilling. I am overwhelmed by the presence that fills my body. The blood is boiling. My body temperature gets hot.\u201cHa, Hess\u2026! Ahhhhhhhh!\u201dKael\u2019s hand clenched my pelvis. Strong enough to leave white fingerprints on my skin.\u201cUhhhhhhh\u2026!\u201dMy mind began to turn white. I slammed my back in a trance.A little more, a little more.\u201cHa, hah\u2026!\u201dAh! Yes, this is it!\u201cUgh! Ugh!\u201dAn unaffordable pleasure gushed from the top of the head.\u201cOh my god!\u201dThen, a tight groan came from below. At the same time, a warm energy spread inside the lower abdomen.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dI crumbled over my favorite\u2019s body. I buried my face in the back of his neck and let out a short breath.A finger came through my hair.\u201cHess\u2026\u201dThe dying voice seemed exhausted. I also opened my mouth in a cracking voice.\u201cAs soon as I got here, I went too far\u2026 Let\u2019s go to the bathroom now.\u201dThen came a little laugh. His reclining upper body vibrated slightly.\u201cHa ha\u2026 That sounds very tempting\u2026?\u201dOh, no. I didn\u2019t mean it that way.I took Kaelus by the hand and pulled him up.\u201cTake off your clothes first.\u201dUntil now, we had conversations with our bodies without properly changing our clothes. Only then did I feel embarrassed. What\u2019s the rush?Kaelus smiled broadly.\u201cThat\u2019s a great suggestion, Hess.\u201dWe took off what we were wearing one by one and wrapped our tongues around each other again. Walking naturally to the bathroom.Kaelus and I had one more long talk like that.~~~~\u201cKael\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not tired\u2026?\u201d\u201cWell.\u201dOutside the window was already dark. Still, the moon was shining brightly tonight.Perhaps they realized that the conversation between the couple was continuing, and the servants managed to avoid the room.I\u2019ve been out all day, but Kaelus must have been riding a carriage much longer than I did. Nevertheless, we went straight to his bedroom without any time to catch our breath.\u201cYou refused the Emperor\u2019s dinner. At least you\u2019ll be hungry.\u201dThen, purple eyes full of color bent mischievously.\u201cSo you\u2019ve had enough.\u201d\u201cNo, I mean\u2026!\u201dArgh, seriously! Why didn\u2019t you ever describe my favorite person as such a sly personality! Author!The long fingers crept through the legs again.\u201cAre you still not satisfied? Then\u2026.\u201d\u201cOh, stop, Kael\u2026!\u201dI almost cried with tears in my eyes. I\u2019ll make sure you eat dinner before it\u2019s too late!Kaelus fell from me in a tasteful way, with great regret. In the meantime, I quickly picked up a gown and put it on my body. Perhaps because it was Kaelus\u2019, the end dragged on the floor.I rang the bell and called the servant, and a quick meal entered the room as if it had been prepared in advance.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hess?\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just\u2026 I\u2019m embarrassed\u2026\u201dDoesn\u2019t it mean that the owner and his wife waited until they resolved all their frustration? I just want to become the dust of the universe and disappear.Nevertheless, Kaelus smiled and laid one plate one by one on the table.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe meal after exercise is very delicious no matter what you eat. It seemed like my appetite had returned after a long time.Come to think of it.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the doctor\u2019s \u201cprescription\u201d came to mind. What he said was that I was losing my appetite so much that the only answer was for Kaelus to return.\u201c?\u201dI had no choice but to laugh at Kaelus with a mysterious expression.\u201cI\u2019ve hardly eaten in the days since you left. So I went to see the doctor, and he gave a prescription to wait for you to come back because it\u2019s a psychological cause.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cThe doctor is a great doctor.\u201dKaelus sighed briefly.\u201cI thought you were a little thinner than before, but it was because of me.\u201d\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dAs I continued this and that conversation, I carefully read the room.How can I say it? The truth that I was actually a regressor.I think the timing is right now. It seems the most appropriate time to sit face to face naturally.But how do I bring it up?\u201cHestia?\u201d\u201cYes, yes?\u201d\u201cYou must have something to say, right?\u201dPurple eyes stared at me and asked.I was at a loss for words.\u201c\u2026\u201dI was possessed. Completely.I focused my attention on the plate as much as I could.\u201cI don\u2019t think you know, but you\u2019re not good at hiding your expressions in front of me.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dA strange sense of dismay. Still, Kaelus smiled with lowered eyes.\u201cI\u2019m very happy.\u201dI also smiled with a weak face.\u201cI\u2019m glad to hear that\u2019s a relief.\u201dKaelus held up his cup and leaned back slowly on the sofa. The long legs are twisted, so it\u2019s really like a pictorial.\u201cNow, tell me anything. Hess. I could listen to it all night.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dStill, I\u2019m nervous, too.In this case, it is better to boldly throw the confession first. That\u2019s how you can cut down on useless thoughts.\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus waited calmly for me to hesitate. He didn\u2019t even show any expression on his face.The truth is he\u2019d be heartbroken too.Don\u2019t you think so? When the other person suddenly says he has something to say, they are nervous until the other person hears the truth.I\u2019m not the only one nervous. We both feel the same way.It was only then that my mouth dropped.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve deceived you this whole time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt may sound like a bolt from the blue, but Kaelus waited silently for my next word.So I have to do my best to respond to his sincerity.\u201cThe truth is\u2026 I didn\u2019t have the ability to predict things.\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe purple eyes grew a lot, but soon they regained their composure.\u201cHa\u2026 as expected\u2026\u201d\u201c?!\u201dWhat do you mean, as expected?Did you guessed beforehand?Rather, I was more surprised.\u201cDid you know?\u201d\u201cNot exactly. It was just a guess. I didn\u2019t think the prophecies you\u2019re talking about are real prophecies\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201dI don\u2019t even know.Then Kaelus sighed lightly.\u201cHess, a long time ago I asked you if it was logically possible to change the future. Do you remember?\u201dHis words carried me back a long way to the past.Come to think of it\u2026\u201cWas it when we just got married?\u2026?\u201d\u201cYeah, I guess you remember that.\u201dYeah. I remember.I didn\u2019t understand what he said at all, but I was frightened by his philosophical and scientific questions.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t explained logically. \u201cProphecy\u201d would refer to the already set future, but is it possible to know it in advance and change it? Then that\u2019s no longer a \u201cprophecy.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dCrazy. I still don\u2019t understand.Kaelus laughed low.\u201cBut everything you said \u2018prophecy\u2019 actually happened. It was a case that definitely existed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSo I guess to myself, the future you know is the ability to explain at least not \u2018foresee\u2019 but something else.\u201dIt\u2019s amazing that he deduced this far in a single conversation.There is nothing lacking in my favorite.\u201cYou\u2019re right, Kaelus.\u201dThanks to my favorite, I felt much more at ease. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.\u201cI\u2019m not a prophet. I\u2019m just a regressor who\u2019s gone back in time.\u201d\u201cReturn..!.\u201dKnowing that I was hiding the truth from him, he waited silently for me to open my mouth.I also have no choice but to live for my favorite.\u201cI died in the temple and woke up again and found myself back in the past. As soon as I woke up, I ran straight here. I had to save you.\u201d\u201cThen was that the day you returned?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKaelus\u2019 face with indescribably complex emotions.Are you imagining how I felt as soon as I came back to the past?\u201cI\u2019m sorry I lied to you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s all right, Hestia. There must have been a good reason.\u201dHe answered calmly.It made me laugh. Why was I so frightened this whole time?\u201cAren\u2019t you angry?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s true that you saved the empire with the future you knew in advance. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a prophet or a regressor.\u201dKaelus came close to me and sat down. Naturally, I looked up at him.\u201cBut I\u2019ve been fooling you all along?\u201dThe long white fingers gently caressed my face.\u201cI don\u2019t have to be angry because I understand.\u201d\u201cI was really worried\u2026\u201dThis is all because Helios made a fuss in front of me. His reaction was so intense that I was afraid that even Kaelus would do the same.The more I think about it, the more unlucky I am.\u201cHestia, if I\u2019m that angry at you, I\u2019m a very petty human being.\u201dNow his thumb gently touched my lips.\u201cTrust me, Hess. I wish you would rely on me.\u201dOnce again, I can feel the breath of fascination.To the point where I can\u2019t breathe.\u201cTo be honest, Hestia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cSometimes I\u2019m surprised by myself. I want everything about you. Body and mind.\u201dKaelus\u2019 smile was so giddy.\u201cOnce I had the urge, it was hard to control myself.\u201dI laughed out loud.\u201cKael, you already have everything.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dHis hand rested on my shoulder. I\u2019m a little tired. If I don\u2019t refuse, I\u2019ll naturally be pushed down.The purple eyes looking down at me from above took on a strange glow.\u201cIt\u2019s still not enough.\u201d\u201cHuh\u2026!\u201dA heavy sense of the whole body.I think the long night will continue again.~~~~The next morning.In the end, I failed perfectly to return to my room. I opened my eyes from Kaelus\u2019 bed, and I was immediately examined by my doctor.The doctor carefully finished his morning checkup. But that\u2019s enough of that!\u201cBy the way, since master is back, you don\u2019t have to report it to the palace, do you?\u201dMy mind went blank.\u201cSir, it\u2019s\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat? You\u2019re going to report to the palace?\u201dMy favorite voice sharpened at once.I slapped my head and my doctor looked puzzled.\u201cWhat? Yes\u2026 Your Highness has ordered\u2026\u201d\u201cHestia.\u201dAs soon as the doctor finished speaking, a hard voice rang in my ear.Oh, damn it.\u201cI need some explanation. Is there anything else you\u2019re hiding from me?\u201dWhat? Kael, you said you wouldn\u2019t get mad about this.I\u2019d like to plead, but first of all, I\u2019ll have to explain it quickly before he misunderstands more.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of it, sir. Let\u2019s go back for now.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am\u2026.\u201dThe doctor retreated nervously, wondering if he had made a mistake.Kaelus opened his eyes and folded his arms.Shoulders that shriveled up.\u201cI was actually caught by the Crown Prince. That I\u2019m a regressor\u2026.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dI bowed my head.\u201cWhen you weren\u2019t there, he came as Hyperion once. I made a slip of the tongue after exchanging a few words with him\u2026\u201d\u201cHeli was here?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dI\u2019m in trouble. I think he\u2019s really mad.Kaelus rose from his seat, creating cool air.\u201cWhat should I report to him? Can I tell him that you\u2019re perfectly fine?\u201d\u201cHuh? Are you going to the palace yourself?\u201dAnxiety followed me to my feet.\u201cWhy, can\u2019t anyone go?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dKaelus picked up his coat on the wall with a bang.\u201cI\u2019ll be back, so you can rest at home.\u201d\u201cWell, but I\u2019ve got a lot of work to do today, so taking a rest is a little\u2026\u201dThen he jerked back at me.\u201cHess.\u201dI had no idea what was going on.\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll stay home.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 Yes.\u201dWow. Did Kaelus just get mad at me? You\u2019re angry, right?The butler was surprised when he prepared the carriage.\u201cAre you leaving already?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201dWithout answering the butler\u2019s question, Kaelus left with a cold wind.\u201cMadam\u2026\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dLet\u2019s just say the facts.\u201cHe found out that Hyperion came and went.\u201d\u201cAha\u2026.\u201dFortunately, Uross was quickly convinced.It seems that there is a separate button that raises Kaelus\u2019 anger. From now on, I\u2019ll have to avoid it carefully.~~~~On this day, I sat down with the doctor to discuss the opening of the clinic. It was because there was a lot of work to be done over the upcoming meeting with former retainers.But his worries were elsewhere.\u201cMadam, I didn\u2019t make a mistake this morning, did I?\u201dNo, that\u2019s not it. I made a big mistake.But I couldn\u2019t upset him, so I decided to answer him in moderation.\u201cI guess it was strange that the crown prince cared about my health, too\u201d\u201cBut why did he look so angry\u2026?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIf you know, just be quiet, doctor.\u201cWe\u2019d better work hard. Don\u2019t upset him for no reason.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dLet\u2019s save ourselves before the fire breaks out. We agreed implicitly and then went back to work.It was almost lunchtime when Kaelus returned.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dI sighed for a long time and carefully watched the incoming favorite.\u201cYou\u2019re back\u2026?\u201d\u201cAh.\u201dKaelus said, leaving his coat to the butler.\u201cYou\u2019re not eating yet, are you?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cGood. I\u2019ll see you at the dining hall a little later.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dWell, I think he\u2019s less angry.~~~~I sat down at the table with a sneaking tension. Soon Kaelus also appeared in comfortable indoor clothes.Servants moved away so that we could have a quiet conversation.\u201cThat is.. How are you doing?\u201d\u201cWell, what do you think we talked about?\u201dKaelus looked straight at me with purple eyes.\u201cWell\u2026 I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry. I just \u2018reported\u2019 the doctor\u2019s diagnosis.\u201d\u201cAre you sure that\u2019s it? The crown prince didn\u2019t say anything weird?\u201dI can feel the strength in his eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s that weird thing you\u2019re thinking of?\u201d\u201cOh, I mean\u2026 About my return\u2026.\u201dWhy am I cringing? I didn\u2019t commit a crime.Kaelus drew a glimmer of glare.\u201cCome to think of it, you said it before. I\u2019m guessing death is the reason for the loss of prophecy.\u201d\u201cYes, I did.\u201d\u201cBut the truth is that the future after that is unknown because you had died at some point.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201dOnce again, I\u2019m truly glad I didn\u2019t even get caught being an possessor.If that\u2019s even caught, alas. The mere thought of it makes me dizzy.\u201cHeli was very worried that you wouldn\u2019t change the future.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be able to change it. I collapsed because I was sick then, so I just have to take care of my health so that I don\u2019t get sick.\u201dFor now, I only fave an answer on the surface of \u201creturner.\u201dBut in fact, there is a fundamental inner problem of possessing. This is something you have to solve by taking time to think about your identity.Anyway, Kaelus readily accepted my answer.\u201cThat\u2019s why he wants to get a report from the doctor every morning.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI had a headache, closed my eyes and pressed my hands around my temple.\u201cWill you be able to do it well?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI replied casually, but he looked up again at me and I flinched again.\u201cAlright, I\u2019ll stay put.\u201d\u201cYou have a very natural talent for really, inadvertently scratching my stomach.*\u201d*TN: worrying himFrom the rare long-worded retort, I think he\u2019s really upset.\u201cI don\u2019t know if I should thank Heli for worrying about you, or if I should be angry.\u201d\u201cWell, let\u2019s just be thankful\u2026.\u201dI rolled my eyes and said. It seems that Kaelus\u2019 expression is ridiculous.But I have something to say, too.\u201cI was jealous, too. The crown princess even held a large prayer meeting at the Lily Palace for your safe return, but I was grateful.\u201d\u201cHa, did Diana do that?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019ve heard a lot about it. But thanks to her, you came back safely, so that\u2019s enough for me.\u201dKaelus threw down the tableware.\u201cWhile I was away from the capital for a while, all sorts of things happened.\u201dWould it be better to talk about all the social issues about Diana? He\u2019s going to open a complaint against the temple soon, so I think it\u2019s better.\u201cEven so, the social atmosphere is very unusual these days. I don\u2019t think the question of the crown princess\u2019 qualifications will end at just word of mouth.\u201d\u201c?\u201dKaelus\u2019 eyes seemed to keep saying the next thing.\u201cAccording to Countess Erinnis, some nobles are discussing the abdication of the crown princess behind the scenes.\u201d\u201c!\u201dHis eyebrows were raised.\u201cBut I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really going to happen. The emperor still firmly supports her.\u201d\u201cEven so, if the pressure of the nobles increases, they will be shaken. If they refuse to hold a cabinet meeting to make their case, there\u2019s no difference.\u201dIndeed, if aristocrats boycott as a group, the emperor will have no choice. It is true that the imperial power is still weak to wield independent power like a tyrant.\u201cOnce the indictment is made public, the discussion of the abdication of the crown princess will come to the surface.\u201dAfter speaking calmly, I asked quietly.\u201cWhat do you think? When the nobles ask you to speak your mind\u2026\u2026.\u201dKaelus replied without hesitation.\u201cI have nothing to say, exactly. Isn\u2019t it right for the parties to decide the matter between the crown prince and his wife?\u201dOf course, his answer is very standard. But to step back like that.\u201cBut you have to think about your position. Silence may be considered rather a sign of approval for the abdication.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, Hestia.\u201dKaelus\u2019s gaze turned to me with a serious light.\u201cSeriously, I\u2019m not interested in that matter. All I want is for them not to get in between me and you.\u201dHis tone was very determined.I smiled to reassure him.\u201cThere\u2019s no way there will be a gap between us. No matter how hard they try to shake it from the\u00a0 outside, you don\u2019t have to worry as long as you and I are in balance.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s true, Hestia.\u201dHe sighed quietly.\u201cBut it\u2019s true that it\u2019s unpleasant. We\u2019re busy just focusing on living happily among ourselves, and it\u2019s getting on my nerves.\u201d\u201cAnyway, the abdication of the crown princess is not just a matter of family within the royal family. You\u2019d better organize your position in advance, too.\u201dWhether you\u2019re on the side of the emperor as you\u2019ve always been, or you\u2019re on the side of the aristocracy, speaking for them.Or be neutral, as Kaelus believes.\u201cOne thing is for sure, the fight shouldn\u2019t be prolonged, Kael.\u201dWasn\u2019t it the peace he gained by removing the Duke Orcus family despite Diana\u2019s lashing out.Frankly, it\u2019s a problem if Diana stays as a crown princess, and it\u2019s a bigger problem if she\u2019s deposed. After being deposed, there will be a division among the nobles to occupy the vacancy.War is inevitable anyway. But it will be possible to shorten the period.He has stabilized imperial politics with all his honor and political fate on the line, and it is a pity that the stability is collapsing so quickly.I hope, if I can, that none of what Kaelus has achieved will be damaged.\u201cHess.\u201d\u201cYes, Kael.\u201dHe looked at me for a long time and then spoke slowly.\u201cA cabinet meeting will be held soon. I\u2019ll report mainly on the outcome of negotiations with the kingdom, but\u2026\u201dHis words slowly made my heart beat.\u201cThen\u2026?\u201dLooking into my eyes, he grinned.\u201cYes, Hestia. I\u2019m going to read your indictment in front of the crown prince and the nobles.\u201d\u201c!\u201dFinally throwing the last bomb.A weapon that would fatally injure Diana and the temple that Helios failed to stop twice.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dMy heart began to tremble.Kaelus, who was willing to sacrifice memories for me.The pretty past made with friends will soon be dyed dark with his own hands.\u201c\u2026Thank you, Kaelus.\u201dI owe him a lot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe first cabinet meeting since returning from the border.Today, I decided to head to the palace with Kaelus. Quietly enter the conference room, to cheer him up close.In addition, this time the emperor also appears at the state council meeting. Holding the hand of Crown Princess Diana, whose position is in danger.On the other hand, he seems to have decided to save his daughter-in-law, but it\u2019s a pity. Today, Kaelus is due to file a complaint against the temple.My heart was pounding with anticipation to see Diana and Helios collapsing in front of my eyes.\u201cWow\u2026\u201dKaelus, who grew up nicely, was truly wonderful. A dark gray suit with colorful silver hair and a calm and intelligent atmosphere.If there\u2019s only one thing that sticks out.\u201cAre you going to use that kravat again?\u201d\u201cThis is needed.\u201dThe fact that he is not willing to give up the kravat that I made by reforming my scarf.If I knew this would happen, I would have made it less noticeable. If I had to express it, it\u2019s like he wrapped his whole body around a luxurious luxury brand, but it feels like there is a cheap thing hanging only on his neck.However, it should be fortunate that the material of kravat had a subtle luster, and that the disaster that looked like a bathroom towel was avoided*.*TN: what she was originally planning on giving him\u201cAre you ready?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dStill, it is a pity that I could not take away that kravat.The indictment was prepared to match the number of people attending the cabinet meeting. That work alone took a few days.It\u2019s a huge amount, but if this can make the temple and the crown prince kneel completely, wouldn\u2019t it be worse for them?Copies of the complaint were placed in several solid boxes. The copy would not be distributed in advance, but Kaelus will enter the state council to finish the negotiation report, and then the court servants will distribute one copy to each of\u00a0 the participants at the time of change of subject.It was Kaelus who would read the document himself, but I am more nervous.\u201cHestia, you\u2019re very nervous.\u201dHe held my cold hand warmly.I had no choice but to admit it.\u201cI guess it\u2019s because I\u2019ve been preparing for this for a long time.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll make sure your efforts are not wasted, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll do well. Kaelus. I\u2019m just sorry. I let you do what I should have done.\u201dKael pressed his lips lightly on my forehead.\u201cIt\u2019s because of Helios\u2019 trick. After all, he allowed me to negotiate with the kingdom as a duke.\u201dAnd I got my hands on Attica.Technically, it\u2019s not a big loss. Still, it is very painful for me to borrow the hands of Kaelus.If I had been more careful, I could have handled it neatly on my own.I made a mistake when writing a memorandum with Helios, so no matter how well I look at it, it was my mistake anyway.\u201cThe accusation you made is perfect. Today\u2019s victory is all your credit.\u201dI don\u2019t agree with him.Today\u2019s victory was entirely up to Kaelus. If he hadn\u2019t given it to me, I wouldn\u2019t have actually been able to file a complaint.\u201cI rather think you have the credit.\u201dI raised his hand that was holding mine. I kissed it with respect and affection.And eye contact.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIn time, it was only natural for our lips to touch each other\u2019s.~~~~I lowered the thick veil, mingled among the nobles, and quietly entered the cabinet.Kaelus headed for the seat of the Imperial Duke, right next to the emperor. He was courteously greeted by everyone there.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dI took a big deep breath.A space where the nation\u2019s ambassadors travel to. The unique solemnity and rigid air permeates the lungs.After all the ministers of state entered, the minister shouted.\u201cHis majesty and the crown prince are entering!\u201dThe emperor walked in slowly with his hand on Diana\u2019s arm. Helios, the crown prince followed suit alone.Diana settled right behind the emperor, closest to Kaelus sitting next to him.Helios sits next to the emperor on the other side. His face is not immediately visible from Kaelus\u2019 position.With the advent of the emperor\u2019s family, the atmosphere that was briefly disorganized soon subsided calmly.\u201cDuke Kaelus. I congratulate you for successfully negotiating with the kingdom. The empire that was on the verge of war was able to overcome the crisis well thanks to you.\u201dThe emperor was the first to notice Kaelus.\u201cThank you, your majesty.\u201dHe rose from his seat and took hold of a report that summarized the results of the negotiations.\u201cFor the past year or so, the kingdom has consistently collected information for imperial aggression, including spying on the defense of its borders under the guise of bandits.\u201dThe hall was silent as if it were holding its breath. Only the calm voice of my favorite rang through the conference room.\u201cRecently, we have even increased our troops on the pretext of a bandit sweep on the border. His highness considered it a major military provocation against the empire.\u201dTo be exact, it was discovered and pointed out by Kaelus, not Helios.As soon as Kaelus overcame his panic disorder and returned to politics, he reminded Helios of border anomalies.\u201cAfter detecting suspicious movements in the kingdom, we immediately started working to stop them. As a result, we were able to set the stage for negotiations before the armed conflict became a reality.\u201dState ministers flapped through the report before them to confirm the details.The remarks continued.\u201cWhat the kingdom ultimately wanted was to enter the empire and leak our wealth to the kingdom. So while I allowed the kingdom to enter on business, I required, in accordance with the laws of the empire, that they borrow more than a percentage of the business funds from banks within the Empire.\u201d\u201cWhoa\u2026.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dThere was a little exclamation here and there. They seemed to be impressed by his exquisite scheme.\u201cIf the conditions are rejected and the military provocation continues, the empire also decided to march across the border immediately after the negotiations break down.\u201dThe kingdom must have been horrified. A large army had gathered at the border, which was no different than usual.A thoroughly prepared diplomatic negotiation. And Kaelus, the best politician and resourceful man in the empire.With this combination, it will be much more difficult to fail than to succeed.\u201cThe kingdom accepted the terms of the empire. So we agreed to allow the merchants of the kingdom to enter the empire, but to make sure that more than half of the capital is filled with imperial capital.\u201dThe boldness of setting up a negotiating table outside the imperial borders also had a significant impact on pressuring the kingdom. From the point of view of the kingdom, it was reasonable to assume that Kaelus, the imperial duke, did not hesitate to come out of the border because he hid another weapon.**TN: saying he wasn\u2019t afraid to leave the border because he had another trick up his sleeveAt the end of Kaelus\u2019 report, the ministers of state applauded in unison. It was a compliment to the best resourceful man who returned after safely finishing his heavy duty.The emperor also clapped his hands with satisfaction.\u201cIt\u2019s the second time I\u2019ve given you such a heavy burden. Good work, Duke Kaelus.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, your majesty.\u201dHis expression was cold all the time, completely unexcited.Soon the applause died down, and Kaelus spoke again.\u201cAnd here, before his majesty and the empire, I have one more thing to say.\u201dI held my breath still.It finally explodes.\u201c?\u201d\u201c?\u201dThe imperial court servants moved quickly and laid down copies of the accusations before the ministers of state. Thick files were soon placed in front of the emperor and the crown prince.The emperor and Helios picked up the document with a mysterious face.\u201c!\u201dHelios\u2019 face, which confirmed the information of the document, turned pale at once.\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dI smiled with satisfaction behind the veil.Even if you were lucky enough to stop it once, you wouldn\u2019t be able to stop it twice. You never would\u2019ve imagined that Kaelus would have brought a complaint himself.\u201cLook, Diana.\u201dAlas. My heart beats so hard that I can\u2019t breathe.Kaelus\u2019 voice rang calmly in the rather tumultuous conference hall.\u201cI would like to make a public accusation today before the Empire and His Majesty about another scandal that has been criticized for its pursuit of worldly interests today.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201c!\u201dPeople who are appalled.I raised my eyes gently and looked at Diana.\u201c\u2026!\u201dThe big blue eyes were shaking violently.Her eyes remained on Kaelus in front of her, and did not fall.\u201cI demand that the accounting books and the list of properties of the temple be made public to his majesty and the people of the empire.\u201dWhat do you think, Diana?How do you feel about the dagger being stuck in you by the hands of the same man you\u2019re desperate to get back?\u201cLook at the present reality, that those who act in accordance with the will of the noble God, do not obey it properly and fulfill self-interest.\u201dHow long did you think Kaelus would miss you?How much more time will it take to get out of your boring past?\u201cThere is evidence in this complaint that the priests have divided what they have and used their sacred wealth in the presence of God, only to raise their stomachs.\u201dHelios, you\u2019ll have to work hard to protect Diana.If you don\u2019t have any more affection for her, now is the time to make a bold decision.Will he give up and save the royal family from the mud?Or will he hold her hand until the end and crash with her.Whenever the dry voice of Kaelus rang in the conference hall, the emperor\u2019s expression grew stiffened.After that, Diana looked even more pitiful. A pale complexion.Helios kept his lips tight, as if trying to control his embarrassment.Serious eyes of the ministers of state, who began to buzz, moved back and forth between each other and passed by Diana once in a while.The indictment was strictly a denunciation of the misconduct of the temple. But even a passing child would know. In this country today, the temple was a symbol of the Crown Princess Diana.Kaelus finished reading the complaint, keeping a cool look on his face throughout.\u201cTaking care of the empire\u2019s internal troubles was also considered loyal to the empire and its emperor. Please confirm to the temple that there is no sanctuary in this country that is beyond your majesty\u2019s control.\u201dThe eyes of the nobles suddenly focused on the emperor and Diana in the back seat.\u201cKaelus, Duke of the Empire, pleads like this.\u201dKaelus sat down again after reading the long complaint.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI felt weak as if I had read the long document myself.At the same time, I admired him again. How can my favorite person stay calm and calm until the end without shaking his voice?Diana\u2019s gaze was fixed entirely near the back of Kaelus\u2019 head. Thanks to him, she didn\u2019t seem to notice that the attention in the hall was focused on her.It\u2019s a waste of the title crown princess because she\u2019s so flustered. I thought she got used to controlling her facial expressions.Soon there was a dead silence in the conference room. Everyone looked at the emperor\u2019s mouth and watched what would come out of him.After a long time.\u201c\u2026the contents of this complaint\u2026\u201dThe emperor finally spoke.\u201cIs everything true, Duke Kaelus?\u201d\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201dKaelus answered immediately without a trace of agitation.\u201cAs it says in this document\u2026 The poor suffered from the plague for a long time because they didn\u2019t get the temple\u2019s treatment on time?\u201d\u201cYes, your majesty.\u201d\u201cCertainly, compared to the situation in Illion that you are taking care of, the situation in this capital is\u2026\u201d\u201cYour majesty, Illion recognized the temple\u2019s negligence early on, supplied the soap, and maintained the sewer system. Thanks to that, the number of infectious diseases has decreased significantly even during the rainy season of summer.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201d\u201cMy conclusion is that, the temple is far from capable of fulfilling the role given to them alone after all. In addition to the temple\u2019s original role in serving and performing rituals, it is right to let the authorities supervise the relief work and medical practices that are entirely entrusted to it.\u201dThe subject of the complaint was very clear. That there was no sacred realm in what a person does.Perhaps this proposition was firmly engraved in everyone\u2019s head who listened to Kaelus today.After a low sigh, the emperor nodded slowly.\u201cI understand the Duke Kaelus\u2019 loyalty to the empire and the imperial family. I will certainly respond to your accusation as soon as possible. I\u2019m a little tired today.\u201dHe slowly lifted himself up on the armrest of the chair. Diana, who had been absent-minded, rushed to the emperor and helped him.The emperor left the meeting at a very slow pace.\u201c\u2026\u201dAnd only Helios was left.The meeting ended with the Emperor\u2019s departure, but he still could not leave and approached Kaelus.\u201cThe duke.\u201d\u201cYour highness the crown prince.\u201dThe flaming golden eyes glared at the calmly sunken ones.\u201cI need to talk to you for a second.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but my wife is waiting\u2026.\u201dWhile Kaelus replied, I walked up behind him with a pompous gait.\u201c\u2026!\u201dHelios distorted his face as soon as he noticed me.\u201cWas it you?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t break my promise with you.\u201dI smiled deeply.\u201cYour highness played me with a loophole, and I also fought back with a loophole.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026!\u201dHelios was about to burst in anger, but he managed to endure it when he confirmed that there were still many people around him.\u201c\u2026both of you come to my office. Right now.\u201dKaelus and I looked at each other for a moment and nodded right away.\u201cWe\u2019ll follow you soon, your highness.\u201dDo you think we\u2019ll be afraid of that?~~~~\u201cI thought you were very concerned about the royal authority!\u201dHelios then vented his pent-up anger.\u201cI\u2019m accusing the temple because I respect the royal family, your highness.\u201dKaelus also responded coldly without losing.I added a few words, too.\u201cThe highest authority in the palace is the crown princess, and then the his majesty the emperor.\u201d\u201cHestia!\u201dWhen Helios burst out, Kaelus\u2019 expression also became fierce.\u201cIf you have something to say, tell me, Helios!\u201d\u201cWhat? Oh, yeah. Good!\u201dOh, it\u2019s a mess. They\u2019re not using any honorifics.\u201cEven if you don\u2019t twist your neck* like this, Diana is already in danger!\u201d*TN: go out of his way to accuse her\u201cIt seemed very comfortable for something like that, didn\u2019t it? Even though the imperial family has owed a huge debt, there is not a single shade on their face.*\u201d*TN: there are no repercussions for the imperial family after Diana\u2019s debt\u201cIn the end, what do you want, Kael? The abdication of Diana? Being blamed for the loss of face to the imperial family?\u201d\u201cCool your head. It was the temple, not the royal family, that I condemned, Heli.\u201dDuring the quarrel, I glanced leisurely around the office. Is there anything to drink?\u201cYou knew I had a deal with Hestia! And yet you\u2019re backstabbing me like this!\u201d\u201cYou are the one who has caught Hess with a cheap trap. Did you think I, her husband, would just watch?\u201dOops. I can hear you. I\u2019m not good at making tea, but would it be worth a drink if I made this much?\u201cI\u2019m going crazy because things haven\u2019t worked out yet, and you\u2019re the one who put an extra load on me!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s politics that doesn\u2019t work out, and who are you blaming for the twisted relationship between you and Diana?\u201dUgh, I can\u2019t drink. It\u2019s the tea leaves that the crown prince drinks, so the quality should be good, but I can\u2019t.\u201cWait a minute, Heli.\u201d\u201cWhat is it, Kael?\u201dKaelus, who was in a fight, suddenly snatched my teapot.\u201cJust do this.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026!\u201dI laughed awkwardly.\u201cThank you, Kael.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t force yourself to drink, and if it doesn\u2019t suit your taste, just throw it away.\u201dHelios laughed in vain.\u201cShall I get you some coffee?\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to treat her, Heli.\u201dKaelus also responded coldly.Anyway, the heated air cooled down because my favorite suddenly poured me the tea.\u201cDidn\u2019t the temple take a step back from Diana anyway? I heard they asked the royal family to repay their loan.\u201d\u201cI did draw a line with the temple first. But public perception hasn\u2019t changed yet.\u201dHelios is right about this. The world is still looking at the temple and Diana on the same line.It can\u2019t be helped because Diana has such a strong presence as a \u201cgoddess.\u201dIt would have been better if she had abandoned the 'saint lady\u201d sooner and changed to \u201ccrown princess\u201d. However, neither of them could be put down, and she was forced to hold them all at once, and eventually had to pay the price.\u201cHey, Hestia.\u201d\u201cHeli\u2026!\u201dAt once, my favorite\u2019s voice became sharp.However, Helios\u2019 tone has softened.\u201cWait. I really want to ask her something.\u201dI looked at Helios with a teacup.\u201cSay it, Your Highness.\u201d\u201cWhat is the result that you really want? And if I give you the result, will you stop the attack?\u201d\u201cWhat I want\u2026.\u201dI laid the glass still on the table. Then, I looked at Helios again.\u201cShe hasn\u2019t apologized yet.\u201d\u201c!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe two men were silent at the same time.I giggled.\u201cMy move was extremely consistent. In fact, the answer is simple.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI narrowed my eyes and laughed.\u201cAnd yet, do you know what it means for the wise Your Highness Helios to continue to want to confirm this?\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dI tilted my head slightly, looking at the shaky golden eyes.\u201cYou want to avoid it. You don\u2019t want to\u00a0 apologize, you don\u2019t want to pay for it, you just want us to move on, right?\u201dCommon excuse for perpetrators who bullied someone. \u2018It\u2019s all in the past. What are you going to do about it?\u2019From Helios or Diana, there\u2019s no way I don\u2019t know what I really want. Isn\u2019t it extremely simple, which can be inferred quickly with a little thought?Nevertheless, the reason why he\u2019s asking is.\u201cDo you want to argue that this is enough, and that it\u2019s enough because it\u2019s been so painful?\u2019\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dHelios could not immediately refute.Is it enough? No. Never.They did not experience a tenth of the despair that Kaelus felt. You didn\u2019t suffer enough to put death into practice.I grinned.\u201cWhen it comes time to sit down and argue with our couple, I\u2019d think about how to deal with this mess first.\u201dWhen the problem seems complicated, simplifying it as much as possible is a shortcut to finding clues quickly.\u201cYour highness has only one thing to focus on. The fact that this accusation is not directed at the imperial family, but at the temple.\u201dI don\u2019t mind giving this much advice to poor Helios.Leaving him alone in thought, I left there holding my favorite\u2019s hand in hand.~~~~As soon as Kaelus and I returned from the imperial palace and relaxed, we climbed onto the bed.There was no energy to roll around in each other\u2019s arms, so we glued our eyes together for a long time.Surprisingly, the accusations at the cabinet meeting turned the whole capital upside down than less than that evening.After a long sleep, we finally came to our senses in the twilight.\u201cOh, my God\u2026 \u2026while I was asleep, I got this many calls?\u201dI was fed up with the pile of letters that my butler Uross had spilled. Seeing that Kaelus can\u2019t say anything, he seems to be surprised too.The butler replied with an embarrassed look.\u201cThere were quite a few visitors. I sent them all back, but\u2026\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI picked up Erinnis\u2019 letter first and read it quickly.\u201cI think a copy of the complaint distributed at the state council is already circulating.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I expected, Hess.\u201dKaelus said in a casual way.\u201cNot everyone who sees the accusation will agree. But it\u2019s enough for the mainstream to agree and become the trend.\u201d\u201cHuhu, I think the trend is already down.\u201dIt had been a long time since I made a public opinion against the crown princess and the temple. Madam Harmonia also steadily gathered public opinion that the temple\u2019s accounting books should be disclosed at her salon before leaving for Attica\u2019s estate.In particular, Erinnis was a person who joined hands with me and even made a joint board. She\u2019s been waiting for the day when the accusations would break out.\u201cI asked the emperor to release the list of the temple\u2019s property in front of him, so what\u2019s left is his decision.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if the emperor rejects the demands of the complaint. The people will take their support for the temple away.\u201dSupport for Diana, who was in the same boat with the temple.And this is the ultimate purpose of the accusation, which I ultimately want.Despair and loneliness when everyone who supported him turned their back.The things that have been done with faith so far have become pieces of paper without any value.I hope that Diana will experience this feeling. I hope for her to despair and weep just like Kaelus.Only then will she be able to sympathize with a little bit of Kaelus\u2019s heart, which she brutally abandoned.Stuck in the notion of morality and justice, she lost her affection and respect for people.This will be the definition of the existence of Diana, which she will carry to the end.~~~~Kaelus took some time off from the emperor. It was a reward for going a long way for diplomatic negotiations.Seeing Kaelus taking a leisurely walk in the garden, I can\u2019t think of him being confined to his room at the time of our marriage.\u201cPhew\u2026 Kael must be happy. Because he\u2019s free\u2026.\u201dI sighed deeply at the accumulated work.We have publicly accused the temple, so we must absorb those who leave as soon as possible.The day was drawing to a close when I decided to invite the priests to work at the duchy\u2019s clinic. It was something I had been planning since Kaelus went to the border, so I wouldn\u2019t struggle on my own.While Kaelus was taking a walk in the garden and taking a break from back-to-back reading, I diligently prepared to greet guests with the doctor and butler.The doctor shook his head.\u201cThere are a lot of people, so there are a lot of things to worry about, madam.\u201d\u201cHa ha, you can just focus on what kind of lectures you\u2019re giving to the guests.\u201dWe can\u2019t just feed the doctors who were former priests. I decided to give my time to the duke\u2019s doctor, who was known by name.The doctor seemed to have a lot of stories accumulated so far. However, I asked him to show the contents of his lecture in advance so that it would not be a \u2018in the old days\u2019 speech.The division of work was clear. The butler was thoroughly responsible for the meals, and the doctor and I focused on filling the meeting.While I was working for so long, Kaelus snuck in.\u201cYou look busy.\u201d\u201cOh, Kael!\u201dNo matter how busy I am, it can\u2019t be more important than my favorite.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Come on in.\u201dThe table that was littered with papers that were quickly pushed aside.\u201cI have nothing to offer but coffee right away. What do I do?\u201dTo me who was sorry, Kaelus smiled affectionately.\u201cI like coffee quite a bit, too, Hess.\u201dHow can you be so considerate with every word you say? Is it the cold and dry Kaelus that was in our early stages of marriage?But that cold favorite was also really charming.\u201cYou\u2019re thinking about something again.\u201dI stopped laughing.\u201cI guess I\u2019m not good at hiding my facial expressions.\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026.\u201dKaelus snorted lightly as he touched his cup of coffee to his lips.I\u2019ve been caught, so I better be honest.\u201cYou\u2019re so sweet now, but I thought you were cool when you were cold too.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dHe wrinkled his brows.\u201cActually, that\u2019s what I liked the first time. Of course, I\u2019m still happy, but you don\u2019t have to erase it.\u201dI remember well how he was infinitely affectionate to Diana.So when he treated me in a rather cold manner, I was rather relieved.Because that was the essence of the character Kaelus. I was grateful that I could see his unadorned true self.If Kaelus was holding back his true nature like when he used to love Diana.It would be very sad for me to love him unconditionally.\u201cHess.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dKaelus put down his glass with a look of much thought.\u201cI didn\u2019t force myself to hide my emotional state from you then and now. You were always the same even when I was in the cold, and you\u2019re still the same.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cI hope you don\u2019t feel nervous about me showing a different attitude. I will always try to be honest with you.\u201dA careful choice of words. My heart fluttered at the careful words that took into account my feelings.As expected, he\u2019s really sweet.\u201cThank you, Kael.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dThe purple eyes that bend gently are very warm.~~~~When the whole capital was infested with temple charges, the duchy was finally visited by former priests.Because of the temple\u2019s lifestyle, which emphasizes integrity, it was impossible for guests to have suits suitable for the aristocratic dinner. So I deliberately told them there wasn\u2019t a dress code beforehand, and to come in comfortable clothes.Still, since I am a host, too comfortable clothes could seem negligent in treating guests. Therefore, it is not a fancy dress, but it is decorated with a few ornaments added to the usual outdoor clothes.Kaelus also wore a light suit. After getting ready, he decided to enjoy reading in his study before dinner time.I stood on the porch, greeted one after another the arriving ex-priests.\u201cEveryone came well. Follow me and you\u2019ll find the dining hall.\u201dOf course they were thrilled, too.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that the noble duchess is coming out in person\u2026!\u201dInstead, they were young people who rarely received such hospitality unless they were bureaucrats. They headed to the dining room one by one with a slightly flushed face.After a while, all the guests who received the invitation arrived. Kaelus and the duchy\u2019s doctor also entered the dinner room.\u201cIt\u2019s Lord Kaelus\u2026!\u201d\u201cDuke!\u201dAlthough they did not use accurate aristocratic manners, they each rose to greet Kaelus in the most polite manner they knew.\u201cToday\u2019s dinner is hosted by my wife, so if you have something to honor, go to her.\u201d\u201cYes, Duke Kaelus!\u201dThe meal began in an amicable atmosphere.Large dishes containing food flew onto the long table one after another. The servants diligently went around the table and filled the empty glasses with wine.\u201cThe lives of the people of the capital are on your hands. You all know how sad it is not to get proper treatment when you\u2019re sick, right?\u201dI emphasized the need for a private clinic to doctors. They also sympathized with my purpose, and the story was generally easy to solve.It was not long before the doctor\u2019s order was reached. Kaelus and I were also poised to sit back and listen.But then.\u201cMaster\u2026!\u201dThe butler, Uross, rushed in with a rare flushed face. He\u2019s not quite a runner, what\u2019s going on?\u201c?\u201dKaelus raised his eyebrows in wonder.Uross whispered quietly enough to be heard only by us.\u201cHer highness the crown princess is here!\u201d\u201c?!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dKaelus\u2019 face revealed his embarrassment.I had no time to think back and forth, so I told Kaelus.\u201cGet ahead, Kael!\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dWhen a person suddenly gets flustered, their mind goes blank.Just like that, Caelus got up in a daze, pushed by my hand.\u201cMaster, then this way\u2026\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dIt has been very rare for Kaelus to be so dazed in recent years, but today we saw a rare sight in many ways.The doctor and the guests were looking at us. I was terribly sorry.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I made a mess.\u201dI clapped my hands to call attention.\u201cWell, let\u2019s continue what we\u2019ve been doing. Please, sir.\u201d\u201cYes, ma\u2019am.\u201dI managed to pull myself together and look forward.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy heart was pounding.I can\u2019t believe she\u2019s here.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With everyone saying they\u2019ll join us if we open the clinic soon.Leaving the table to the servants, I brought Kaelus back to my room.\u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cHmm? You mean me?\u201dA dry face as if talking about someone else.\u201cOf course! You just met the crown princess.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s it.\u201dIt seems strange. I didn\u2019t want to hear about the relationship between the two, but I\u2019m worried because my favorite looks like that.\u201cDid Diana complain about the indictment? Then let me handle it. I was supposed to make and detonate it from the beginning..\u201d\u201cNo, she apologized.\u201d\u201c\u2026?!\u201dA casual, snappy reply. It took me a moment to fully understand his answer.\u201cShe apologized?\u201d\u201cYes, she said she didn\u2019t blame me for wanting to die.\u201dThat\u2019s ridiculous. That\u2019s an excuse, not an apology!\u201cSo\u2026 Is she saying that she\u2019s sorry for making such a choice unintentionally?\u201d\u201cShe said I\u2019m sorry over and over again, so it was enough. I told her not to apologize for this anymore.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI grabbed my forehead. What am I supposed to do with this stupid girl?You\u2019ve been silent all this time, and now you\u2019re rushing to apologize because you\u2019re upset at the temple accusation?The visit to Kaelus seems to be about trying to fix the situation in its own way, but that cannot contain water that has already been spilled.**it can\u2019t fix what\u2019s already been brokenWell, from now on, public opinion will help on its own without me having to touch it, so it is a big mistake if Diana thought everything could be solved by appealing to Kaelus.I\u2019m not happy with anything like an apple that was stabbed.\u201cHow do you feel, Kael?\u201d\u201cHow do I feel?\u201dKaelus tilted his head.\u201cWell, I\u2019m not particularly happy, I\u2019m just a little embarrassed.\u201dWell, Diana shouldn\u2019t have come in out of the blue. Who wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed if they barged in like this while serving guests?If you want to apologize, shouldn\u2019t you make a proper meeting appointment and create a serious atmosphere? That way you\u2019ll feel the sincerity, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re doing something bothersome, what are you doing?Apologizing to make someone as good as a benefactor die, what? You didn\u2019t want him to die?I hope someone can teach Diana how to apologize properly to the other person or how to sincerely admit wrongdoings.Anyway, the apology she made today is not the \u2018apology\u2019 I really want.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to accept an apology that\u2019s not even like an apology, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cHestia, I honestly don\u2019t want to talk more about the past. And I don\u2019t really want to be involved with Diana.\u201dKaelus\u2019 attitude was surprisingly firm.I was absentminded for a moment.Are you saying that it\u2019s okay to just accept an apology like this?\u201cIs this really enough?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dThe feeling of something being very slightly deviated.A strange sensation in which the heart and head rattle at the same time.But before I could look into what it was, Kaelus held me tightly and I was interrupted.\u201cHess, you\u2019re enough for me.\u201dA confession out of the blue.I was puzzled, but I accepted it happily for now.\u201cHa ha, the same goes for me.\u201dI also think that the only purpose of living in this world is Kaelus.If we feel the same way, we should be moved to tears.\u201c\u2026?\u201dBut once again.There is a strange sense of incompatibility between the head and the heart.What the hell is this?\u201cHestia\u2026\u201dBut before I could see into the true nature of my emotions, my favorite\u2019s hand wrapped around me like a snake.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThe body without resistance was teased by soft hands to its heart\u2019s content.The body, faithful to its instincts, slowly heated up.\u201cYes\u2026\u201dThere was a groan in the seething delight.I can\u2019t do it. I have to put my mind aside for a bit.\u201cKael\u2026 to bed\u2026\u201dBut he seemed unwilling to listen to me. His hand slid into my clothes and pulled down my underwear.\u201cKae, Kael?\u201dI was taken aback for a moment. The bed was nearby, so why?He quickly loosened his belt with one hand. The sofa was too cramped to properly position ourselves. I gave up my lower body helplessly.\u201cArgh!\u201dIt was an unimaginable pain to insert without foreplay. What the hell is the rush? I burst into tears.\u201cKael\u2026! It hurts, it hurts\u2026!\u201dThen, his finger gently wiped the tearful eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Hess. I\u2019m sorry.\u201dI shouted inwardly at his apology. If you\u2019re sorry, why are you being like this?\u201cUgh\u2026\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 Hess\u2026 \u2026My wife\u2026\u201dWhile groaning painfully, his voice was somehow desperate.I wonder how he feels about me now.\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201dI slowly relaxed my arm from pushing him away.Yeah, let Kaelus do whatever she wants. He\u2019s always been fantastic enough to satisfy me, so if I leave everything to him, my complicated mind will be blown away.\u201cHess\u2026\u201dI closed my eyes tightly.Kaelus held my legs in both arms and began to act hastily as if he were being chased by something. A groan broke out like a scream.\u201cAh! Ah! Ah! Ah!\u201d\u201cOh, my.! Oh my god!Kaelus gasped and thrusted violently. The thud sounded like thunder in my ear. It pushed mercilessly, as if it was only aimed at relieving the desire.\u201cHuh, Kael, Kael! Ahhh!My hands stirred in the air. His waist was half lifted and shook completely in the air. My favorite\u2019s figure who desperately wanted me.I was bewitched by him before I knew it.\u201cAh, ah\u2026! Ah! Ah! Yes!\u201dTo the sound of the slapping flesh, the pleasure rose.Sometimes it\u2019s okay to be rough. I don\u2019t feel so bad about this feeling of being owned by my favorite.\u201cOh, my. Oh, my\u2026 Sigh\u2026!\u201dKaelus took a short breath and bit my held leg.\u201cUgh!\u201dA little pain ran all over my body. The pain soon magically turned into pleasure and flowed through my body.\u201cHmm, hmm\u2026\u201dBefore I knew it, the pain was gone. I almost ran my upper body down to the floor. In an almost inverted position, my body shook endlessly every time he hit hard.\u201cOh, my! Oh my god! Ah\u2026!\u201dI like the unfamiliar feeling that the unfamiliar posture brings. I twisted my waist by itself. The angle of insertion had also changed. A strange sensation of pleasure came in.\u201cHuh! Haha!\u201dI gasped without a chance to break up the coquettishness. From afar came the voice of Kaelus.\u201cHess, ahhhhhh\u2026 Don\u2019t think about anything else.\u2026. It\u2019s just me\u2026 I\u2019m the only one\u2026!\u201d\u201cOh my god!\u201dEven if I wanted to say yes, I didn\u2019t have time to open my mouth. Pleasure licked away like a flame. The whole body bounced up.\u201cHa! Ha, ha\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cKk, hmm\u2026! Sigh\u2026! Whoo\u2026\u2026!\u201dKaelus drove into me like I was going to swallow him. He stabbed and stabbed fiercely to the depths of my body.\u201cAh\u2026! Ah!\u201dMy mind is all messed up. My toes curled strongly at the hot pleasure of continuous waves. One hand touching the floor grabbed the carpet. I twisted my waist as hard as I could.\u201cHa\u2026! Whoo!\u201dLike a prostitute struggling with lust, obscene communion broke out.I\u2019m being eaten deliciously by him. I became a feast enjoyed by my favorite. With a greedy wriggle of the lower lip.\u201cWhew\u2026!\u201dKaelus clenched his teeth. The moaning of reaching its limit heralded its climax.At that moment, he bit my calf again. The whole body was struck by lightning.\u201c!\u201dIn an unguarded open body, the climax hit like a strong wave.\u201cAh, ah, ah\u2026! Oh my god!\u201dI shuddered and bent heavily. At the same time, Kaelus\u00a0 also finally vented out his patience.\u201cWhew\u2026! Whoo!\u201dMy eyes flashed. My whole body trembled and I couldn\u2019t move. I was completely ragged, slanted on the sofa.\u201cUgh\u2026\u201dI groaned faintly, and suddenly a hard arm was supporting my back. Kaelus laid me down straight on the sofa again after I had fallen.\u201cHess\u2026\u201dA sweet voice drenched my ears. Still, I didn\u2019t even have the strength to answer.\u201cYes\u2026\u201dThe field of vision slowly blackened. In the midst of daze, the question that I had been trying to bury bloomed again.Why was he so urgent? What made him nervous? Because I felt some kind of unease in me.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut before I could think it over, I passed out.~~~~When accusations of irregularities against the temple erupted, the scandal fell on not only the society but also the people of the whole kingdom.The betrayal of the people was indescribable. From the very day the complaint was filed, people demanding clarification and apology began to camp in front of the temple.There were papers everywhere on the busy street. Most of the content strongly condemned the secularization of the temple.\u201cOh, my God, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re wasting that precious donation!\u201d\u201cHow much money they had, they lost a lot of money while investing for profit!\u201d\u201cSomeone is still suffering from hunger. I can\u2019t believe it.\u201dIn particular, as in my experience before returning to Korea, there was also a time that I asked the priest to meet a saint and was coldly rejected.\u201cLook at this. The temple and the saint are no longer on the side of the people.\u201d\u201cThe saint entered the palace and completely changed.Public opinion, which had been rampant, slowly began to converge.The temple began to deteriorate a long time ago, but the conclusion was that after producing the crown princess, they became more explicit in pursuing power and the secular world.It was Diana who was blamed for the secularization and depression of the temple.This is because it is widely known that she, who achieved a rise in her status as a crown princess at the common people\u2019s shrine, attracted a large number of priests to the palace and strictly separated from existing political forces.\u201cI thought it was clean, but I was going to push out the common people and the nobles and take over the temple!\u201dPeople interpreted this as revealing the temple\u2019s ambition for power.Even if Diana herself simply showed that she was different from the nobles, she was suspicious enough in the eyes of the people who did not know her \u201cdeep meaning.\u201dIn addition, when the complaint revealed that she had \u201ccomplained\u201d about the soap supplied to Illion, the commoners of the capital were properly turned upside down.The specific reason for Diana\u2019s complaint \u2013 which she did not distribute for free \u2013 did not appear in the complaint.I cleverly distorted her original intentions by deliberately not putting it in a complaint. And my attempt at this was perfectly successful.The people compared themselves to the healthier Illionites, and accepted that Diana opposed the supply of cheap soap because she was already privileged as a royal.\u201cThe crown princess was an incredible person, too! I\u2019m ashamed of who I once called a saintess.\u201d\u201cI hate the \u2018bad guy who I thought was good, but actually the bad guy\u2019 rather than the original bad guy.\u201d**TN: really confusing sentence but they hate Diana who they thought was good but was actually the bad guy even worse than who they thought was the bad guyEach person I encountered was not sparingly criticizing the temple and the crown princess.I was truly relieved.\u201cThis is it! This is the picture I wanted from the beginning.\u201dA scene where the whole world turns its back on the heroine and points its finger at her.I wonder if she felt a little bit of Kaelus\u2019 feelings now.~~~~As the imperial city\u2019s public opinion deteriorated rapidly, the aristocratic society began to move busily without missing this time.A few days after reading the complaint at the cabinet meeting, Erinnis sat face to face with a determined face.\u201cDuchess Hestia, tomorrow, the nobles say they will formally demand the emperor\u2019s abdication of the crown princess.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026!\u201dI didn\u2019t hide my expectations.\u201cIt\u2019s better to push ahead quickly when public opinion is in full swing. No matter how important it is, the public sentiment that has once boiled down won\u2019t last very long.\u201d\u201cThe duchess is right. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve prepared a discussion about the decommissioning.\u201dErinnis also nodded furiously.\u201cThe board wasn\u2019t filled by all of the imperial nobles, but they still collected them to a significant extent. At this point, most of the aristocracy would feel the same way.\u201d\u201cAs I\u2019ve always said, we don\u2019t need accurate figures. Just the impression of \u2018consistency\u2019 is enough to put pressure on them.\u201d\u201cBefore bringing the agenda to the cabinet meeting, all the people who signed the joint board in front of the Lion Palace will gather.\u201d\u201cWhoa.\u201d\u201cAs the duchess said, the visual effect is the best to give the impression that most nobles want her to abdicate.\u201dI laughed with satisfaction.\u201cAs expected, you are the countess who understands what I mean.\u201dIf I say one thing, where else can I find a comrade who understands and practices it? There is no one, if not personally close, that is better than this, at least politically on the same boat.Erinnis smiled, too.\u201cI didn\u2019t know how fortunate it is to join sides with the duchess. If I were to pick just one person I didn\u2019t want to turn into an enemy, I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to pick the Duchess. I mean it.\u201d\u201cOh, I don\u2019t need any more compliments! Thank you, Countess Erinnis.\u201dIt\u2019s refreshing.Diana. You were lucky to be born as a heroine and become a crown princess. You drank cider and walked only on the flower path, right?Now you\u2019re finally back in your spot.Please don\u2019t feel wronged. The title of\u00a0 crown princess really doesn\u2019t suit you.Do you know that sometimes thoughtless innocence is the most cruel? Kaelus was killed once by your naive accusation.I want to show you what the end of a narrow-minded idealist is like. That\u2019s real justice in reality.\u201cI will bring down the crown princess, duchess.\u201dErinnis assured in a confident voice.\u201cOkay. Please take care of me until the end.\u201dThe finishing touch.I shall make the final point as the abdication of Diana.This is how my revenge will be completed.~~~~After his vacation, Kaelus went back to the palace.As the head of state in charge of government affairs, there was always a lot of work to deal with in front of Kaelus. Having rested for a few days, he naturally had a lot of work to do.\u201cCan I come with you and help you?\u201dAs he was getting ready to go out, I asked with a worried look.\u201cI know it\u2019s much better if you help me, but you can\u2019t.\u201dKaelus gently swept my hair aside.\u201cYou\u2019re not free. You\u2019re in charge of Illion\u2019s and Attica\u2019s internal affairs.\u201d\u201cWell, but\u2026\u201dWhat can I do? It\u2019s more sad that my lovely favorite suffers than I suffer.But Kaelus was quite adamant, too.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t overdo it. I don\u2019t want you to repeat your past of being sick and dying.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dHe was so serious that I had to back down.~~~~After sending Kaelus off, I returned to my room and flopped down on the sofa.\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dI lost all my strength.To be honest, I can\u2019t get my hands on anything now that I\u2019m done with my work.As Kaelus said, the internal affairs of the two territories were still in my hands, but there is no motivation to work hard.\u201c\u2026\u201dYeah, this is the problem. I\u2019ve never thought about the next time I would achieve my goal.When I first became possessed, I thought that I would be relieved if I watched the original work and watched the ending. So I lived generously focusing only on being a fanatic.When the possession didn\u2019t end even after the ending, it was truly dark. What pleasure would I have to live in a world without Kaelus? It was a painful time to open my eyes every morning.And this life as a regressor.I had run so far only with the determination to give Kaelus the leash of life and get revenge on Diana and Helios.Just as I\u2019m about to achieve that goal.What am I going to do from now on?\u201cFirst of all\u2026 I have work in front of me\u2026.\u201dI stared at the pile of papers.I\u2019ve achieved all of my goals to live, but my life is still going on.\u201cNext goal, well, I can take my time.\u201dThere is only one concern.That Kaelus will grieve a lot if I can\u2019t change the future and end up dying.I remember what Kaelus said to me after receiving an apology from Diana.A confession that \u201cyou\u2019re enough\u201d.After reflecting on why it wasn\u2019t so uplifting.\u201c\u2026I feel pressured.\u201dSurprisingly, the conclusion was this.I am the only person Kaelus can look at in his entire life.Was Hestia, who neither possessed nor returned, a significant part of the novel? She was definitely not. She was just a passing extra.I was able to save Kaelus because I was a reader from outside the book. I\u2019m not \u201cHestia\u201d.What was the result that was faithful to the role of an extra in the novel? Didn\u2019t Kaelus die after the happy ending of the original novel?There is no other reason why Kaelus could be saved and loved by the duchess.This is because after the return, I did not look on the world as an extra and actively intervened in the world as a kind of secondary creator.That means.\u201cI\u2019m not a fictional character\u2026\u201dOnce again, I lost all my strength.I\u2019m not a character in a novel, I\u2019m just an ordinary reader outside the novel. I was not born an aristocrat, nor was I good at scheming.My real substance is nothing but a fanatic of Kaelus. Just a big fan, far from being the only one he\u2019s ever devoted to loving.Perhaps in the near future, Diana and Helios will have a cold relationship with each other.No, I\u2019m sure it will.I didn\u2019t want to be loved by my favorite in the first place. I just wanted to revive him and inspire him to continue to live.That\u2019s why I was able to run without hesitation. Good or bad, but only for the happiness of the favorite.\u201cIf this was the real world, I wouldn\u2019t be able to do this. Of course.\u201dI breathed a deep sigh.I am not ignorant of morality.It is admitted that each person has a different story, and that there may be such circumstances even in incomprehensible things.I know it\u2019s not a good thing to build up the other person\u2019s life just because I\u2019m angry with someone.Pursuing open-minded cider in real life, I remembered that someone I don\u2019t know could suffer the wrong damage.When solving a problem, you can\u2019t simply respond one-to-one like a linear function.I\u2019ve realized enough even in my not-so-long life.In a world where people live and breathe, no one deserves to die.I don\u2019t deserve to judge someone like that.I am also a guilty and flawed, very ordinary \u2018person\u2019 who knows that I should always be generous about other people\u2019s mistakes.Why? Because it\u2019s a person.We\u2019re not perfect at all, so trying to be a better person while correcting mistakes is \u2018being a person.\u2019\u201cBut this is a novel.\u201dI\u2019m the only one who knows a huge secret that people here don\u2019t know.A reader who knows all the past and innermost thoughts of the main characters from an omniscient point of view.I\u2019m not trying to feel superior just because I\u2019m different from the people in the novel. I mean, I\u2019m from an outside world, hard to live with people here.Still, will I be able to live happily here for the rest of my life, just like the beings in this world?No, more explicitly.\u201cCan I endure like this for the rest of my life\u2026?\u201dTo be honest, I just want my possession to end at this point.I want to enjoy the ending that I made the way I wanted it. I don\u2019t have to look at the stale and gruesome reality that follows.I\u2019m just happy to see the end of the story I made.That\u2019s why it\u2019s too much.Kaelus\u2019 confession that I\u2019m enough.\u201c\u2026\u201dLook at the pile of papers again.Simple labor is the best when things are troublesome.\u201c\u2026\u2026If you have time for useless thoughts, let\u2019s work. Yes?\u201dI try to comfort myself by talking to myself.~~~~\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dKaelus, who breathed a deep sigh, also seemed quite tired for several days.\u201cAs expected, there\u2019s too much work piled up, right?\u201dWhen I asked him, determined to help him, if I had any chance, he shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s not because I have a lot of work, Hestia.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dHave you already taken care of it? That\u2019s a competent favorite.But why does he look so exhausted?\u201cDo you have any other troublesome problems?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dKaelus frowned and thought for a moment.I thought it might be difficult for him to tell me, so I decided to wait in silence for now.Then.\u201c\u2026Noblemen have been gathering in front of the Lion Palace for days.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dThat\u2019s what happened. Erinnis said she would gather people in front of the emperor\u2019s residence.However, seeing that they are troubling my favorite, it seems that they are really gathering and exercising their skills.Kaelus shook his head.\u201cThe problem is they want something from me. I always answer the same way, but it\u2019s not enough.\u201d\u201cI see they\u2019re asking you to approve of the abdication.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a pressure of silence. Whoo\u2026.\u201dKaelus looked genuinely puzzled.\u201cThe emperor must be holding up the pressure well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s because the aristocrats aren\u2019t rejecting the cabinet meeting yet. But if he stalls, he\u2019ll end up with a catastrophe.\u201dI also emphasized to Kaelus that he should not take a long time. Should the political situation, which has been stabilized at best by his sacrifice, be in chaos again?I asked, carefully examining his appearance.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you agree?\u201d\u201cAs soon as I agree, this issue is completely out of Helios\u2019 hands.\u201dHe shook his head firmly.Kaelus\u2019 position on the abdication of the crown princess is primarily a matter between the crown couple.So until anything came to a conclusion between Diana and Helios, Kaelus refused to intervene thoroughly.\u201cRegardless of their intentions, if she loses her royal status under external pressure, it greatly weakens the imperial power. So based on this, the empire will collapse.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dWhat does it matter if this empire collapses or not? To be honest, it doesn\u2019t matter to me.But Kaelus is the duke of this country, the pillar of this empire.At least for him it\u2019s an empire that is dear to him, protected by his hand.Therefore, I also decided to follow my favorite\u2019s position without a word.\u201cI\u2019ll do as you wish.\u201d\u201cThank you, Hess.\u201dWell, even if I didn\u2019t come to the surface and drag Diana down, Helios will have no choice but to let go of Diana\u2019s hand.The more you hold on to her and prolong her time, the more disadvantaged it is on the emperor\u2019s side. Otherwise, a boycott of the cabinet meeting would be formed.Helios, as everyone admits, is essentially a cold ruler. He\u2019s hanging in there right now because of his affection for Diana, but he\u2019ll make a decision either way soon.Then which way would it be? Is the old love that has cooled down more precious than the rule of the empire?So there is absolutely nothing to worry about. Because I believe in Helios\u2019 coldness.~~~~The demands of the nobles for the abdication of the crown princess continued.I decided to obey Kaelus, so I deliberately shut myself up in the duchy without showing my face at the palace.Honestly, from my point of view, I have a lot to say even if I don\u2019t go out to the palace and protest.Have any of the nobles who have been struggling in front of her ever been as fierce and blatant as I have been? I even had a public argument at a tea party she hosted.I was the first to collect public opinion, and I was the one to actually collect information and write a complaint. Although I got help from Kaelus at the end.None of the nobles dared to say anything about me stepping back from here.If it\u2019s unfair, you can come and complain. I\u2019ll take care of you as much as I want.However, fortunately, there seems to be enough firepower even if I don\u2019t walk there directly, and there has been no contact yet to explicitly ask me to add to the strength.They are more shameless than they seem. This is why I like aristocrats.~~~~One day, when I was focusing on the internal affairs of the territory at home, Kaelus contacted me again that he would return late from the palace.\u201cI thought he could take a break after negotiations with the kingdom, but that\u2019s not true at all.\u201dI\u2019m worried that Kaelus will overdo it day and night. I can\u2019t let him die because he\u2019s my favorite who saved my life.I\u2019m actually busy dealing with the tasks of the two territories alone, but I\u2019d rather do it a hundred times than make my favorite suffer.As I was working in the room again after having dinner first, I could hear the sound of a carriage wheel rolling quietly from outside.Should I go out and greet him today? Hurry up and get up and go out to the front door.\u201cKael, did you have dinner?\u201dAs a native Korean, my biggest concern is that my beloved favorite can\u2019t even eat properly.**TN: Korea was devastated after the war, and food was harder to come by. So to show your concern for someone\u2019s well being, you ask if they have eaten.He nodded with his usual expressionless face.\u201cI had a rough meal.\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019ll ask the butler and make a simple soup.\u201d\u201cNo, more than that\u2026\u201d\u201c?\u201dKael, who suddenly stared at me. I examined his expression carefully. Come to think of it, his face seems rather stiff than expressionless.\u201cI need to talk to you. Hestia. Can we walk in the garden for a minute?\u201dI had a heart attack for some reason. I don\u2019t know why, but my gut tells me so.\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dI\u2019m out of breath because of anxiety.~~~~A dim light was lit along the promenade in the dark garden. It\u2019s a quiet night garden, but I can\u2019t see any of it now.My voice went up in a fit of fear.\u201cI thought I\u2019d be able to relax because all the big cases were gone. But I\u2019m still busy.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201dI got nervous for some reason because of the short answer.\u201cThe first report has finally arrived from Madam Harmonia. Attica is looking forward to the management of the new lord.\u201d\u201cOh, I see.\u201dConsidering that he was not interrupting and somehow answering in short answers, it is clear that Kaelus has a heavy story that it is hard to bring up.I am more and more worried.\u201c\u2026Kael. What the hell is going on\u2026?\u201dIn the end, I couldn\u2019t resist and bought it first. The heart beated uncontrollably.Kaelus stopped walking.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dA white face turned straight at me.\u201cWhat you said before\u2026 I mean, your purpose.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cWas it that the crown prince and his wife apologized and they regretted the past?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dI replied, rolling my eyes nervously. Why are you bringing that up all of a sudden?\u201cWell, can you say that you\u2019ve accomplished your purpose now?\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dI don\u2019t believe I achieved everything. What are you talking about?Diana hasn\u2019t apologized properly to Kaelus yet. The apology she made last time was just a show to avoid the imminent crisis!But his eyes are.\u201cHess, I intend to officially announce to the emperor tomorrow in front of the nobles that I do not wish to dispose of Diana.\u201d\u201c!\u201dAt the moment, nothing came to mind.You\u2019re going to do what?\u201cI decided to break my determination to remain neutral. Diana will not lose the title of the crown princess.\u201d\u201c\u2026!\u201dI doubted my ears. So, Kaelus is helping Diana.\u201cDethroned, not to\u2026\u201d\u201cYeah. Honestly, things aren\u2019t so good. It\u2019s hard to remain neutral as I believe anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI felt hopeless.So what he means is, he\u2019s going to end all the fighting like this.Now, Diana is on the brink. In order for her to truly realize her arrogance and wrongdoing and reflect on herself, it is only possible if she has lost everything she has ever built on the flower path of lady rofan!She gave my favorite a shallow apology, so easily on that pretentious cliff.A chance to self-reflect. In vain.\u201cThis, this\u2026 You\u2019re going to save her?!\u201d\u201cHess, listen to me.\u201dKaelus held my arm firmly. I could feel his eyes towards me, but my eyes were already lost and shaken aimlessly.\u201cHeli and Diana apologized for being indifferent to me. Thanks to you for enlightening them.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t bear a grudge in my heart anymore. The most important thing for me right now is how you and I will live a happier life regardless of those two. Just that.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI still didn\u2019t say anything. Honestly, I didn\u2019t hear a word he said.\u201cHestia, look at me!\u201dAt last he grabbed me by the face and forced me to face him.\u201cCan\u2019t we just think about what we\u2019re going to be happy with, without getting involved with them anymore? Let the silver lining flow away, and think only of us here\u2026!\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to hold onto your grudge like that. The two have already regretted and apologized enough. That really made me feel better!\u201dIt\u2019s okay?So, let\u2019s end it in a vague way? Diana didn\u2019t lose anything.\u201cI want to stop fighting now, Hestia. Instead, I want to focus on being happier with you.\u201d\u201c\u2026so\u2026.\u201dI gently moved my eyes to look at the purple in front of me.\u201cLet\u2019s stop here\u2026?\u201dWithout seeing the end, you just want to push yourself like this and just change your decision?Before we burst the cool cider, let\u2019s just make a bubble and then we\u2019ll end it vaguely?The glassy purple looked at me and affirmed.\u201cYes.\u201dAt that moment.\u201c\u2026!\u201dA strange sense of awakening from something struck me.A stranger outside the realm of familiarity. A reader outside the novel who watches the innocent people who live by the flow of the novel without knowing anything.The greatest virtue of romance fantasy is vicarious satisfaction. through the actions of the characters in the novel who do what is absolutely impossible in the harsh reality.You have to pop the refreshing cider in a fantasy novel.Otherwise, the development will inevitably be criticized for harsh comments. That\u2019s the real identity of the world.\u201c\u2026\u201dA brilliant, mind-boggling, fundamental question.The land I\u2019m standing on, is it real?Or is it a novel?\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026!\u201d\u201cI told you I\u2019d do as you please. I\u2019ll do that.\u201dI\u2019m an extra. My fate was to follow the decisions of the main characters.At the same time, I think as a reader.A novel that was like eating a million sweet potatoes.**TN: frustrated or impatient feeling about a situationIt\u2019s enough to stop.~~~~\u201c\u2026\u201dI was sprawled out on the bed.My heart is empty. It\u2019s as if something in my head has slipped out at once.What was my original purpose of living in this world?It was Kaelus. It was to make him live happily with the will to live.And Diana and Helios, who made my favorite person despair, to desperately hit the ground and regret it. A sincere apology to Kaelus.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ve achieved everything\u2026?\u201dI\u2019m afraid not. I don\u2019t think so.After all, Diana didn\u2019t taste the real bottom of the hole. Only when I dispose of the crown princess and she loses everything she has will I get the real end I want.Come to think of it, what I really wanted was to punish Diana bitterly. In return for bringing my favorite to tears and eventually leading to death.Thinking apart from Kaelus, honestly, Diana has no contact with me. There is no such thing as to be indebted or to have an enemy.Nevertheless, the reason why I went around with all my heart and soul for Diana\u2019s downfall is none other than Kaelus.So I don\u2019t know what to do when my favorite who has to be the subject of revenge stops this revenge on his own.My hatred is still alive. I\u2019m still mad at the heroine.Kaelus, who is my main character, is stepping down because he has no intention of solving it anymore, so what should I do now?I still haven\u2019t forgiven Diana. If Kaelus can\u2019t get revenge, I\u2019m willing to get revenge instead.But what he wants.\u201c\u2026 Let\u2019s stop\u2026?\u201dIt\u2019s terribly futile.Was the punishment I have done so far for the original female lead and the male lead really useful?Did Kaelus really want my revenge?What the hell have I done so far?\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dIt\u2019s just a laugh.~~~~The next day, early in the morning.\u201c\u2026\u201dI heard Kaelus leaving for the palace over the open terrace.He\u2019s just going. To save his old love, Diana, from abdication.Because Kaelus remained neutral, the nobles were able to stand up fiercely. However, if he clearly expresses his opposition, the demands of the nobles will inevitably lose their power.Above all, Kaelus is the head and duke of the nobles of this country.In addition, his status has risen beyond envy of the emperor due to a series of events, such as successful negotiations with the kingdom and the rich management of the Illion estate.The weight of every word of Kaelus is heavier than the cries of ten nobles.\u201cDiana must be happy. The second lead protected her until the end.\u201dI spat out lonesomely.With Kaelus\u2019s statement, Diana will dramatically escape the crisis of abdication. Instead of falling to the bottom, she will live in a leisurely way, enjoying all kinds of glory as a crown princess.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI\u2019m so embarrassed. I\u2019m out of breath.I don\u2019t even like the air surrounding me.\u201c\u2026\u201dWith genuine intensity.I want to quit this novel.~~~~Sure enough, around noon, an urgent message arrived from Countess Erinnis.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy mouth is bitter as I read the letter.As expected, Kaelus went to the nobles gathered in front of the Lion Palace and officially expressed his intention that \u201cthe Crown Princess cannot be deposed.\u201dPeople were instantly quiet as if they had poured cold water on them. Kaelus urged the nobles to disband in a polite but firm tone, and so they dispersed as their morale was completely dampened.Erinnis, do you want to know if I\u2019m against Kaelus? She was wondering if I was trapped in the mansion.\u201cHahaha\u2026.\u201dI get this misunderstanding because I\u2019ve been so quiet.I threw Erinnis\u2019 letter into the fireplace. The letter quickly caught fire and burned quickly.\u201c\u2026\u201dThe weather is sunny, unlike my cloudy mind.I reached out for a moment. a gentle breeze above the palm\u201cIt\u2019s cool\u2026.\u201dI sat on the terrace railing, muttering meaninglessly.Jump off.I rolled the words that had been floating in my head all morning once again on the tip of my tongue.Quit.\u201c\u2026\u201dHonestly, is that possible?Damn, my possession continues over and over again. Every time I wake up, I am in this disgusting novel.In fact, I\u2019ve even died once \u2013 although it\u2019s a presumption. Nevertheless, I opened my eyes again in the world with \u2018regression\u2019.So dying isn\u2019t the end.\u201cWhoo\u2026.\u201dSitting on the railing, I peeped down. It\u2019s not a fatal height because it\u2019s only the second floor. Even if I fall, I will only break a few bones, and I will not die.The sudden sound of a carriage. A large carriage had just passed through the gate of the mansion and is coming in front of the porch. Kaelus seems to have returned from the palace.\u201c\u2026\u201dI never thought I\u2019d hate to see my favorite\u2019s face.But for the first time now, I hated to see Kaelus.I can\u2019t believe you forgave her so easily. What pain you\u2019ve been through. You should\u2019ve let her go through the same thing. Do you have any idea what I\u2019ve been up to with so much poison?I turned away from him. Then my gaze turned back down the terrace.If I die again this time.Then can I go back to my real reality? Can I leave this novel?\u201cUh\u2026\u201dBut I\u2019m afraid. I can\u2019t make a dangerous attempt at something I\u2019m not sure about.But how can Diana live her life enjoying all the wealth and glory?When I close my eyes and open it again, I hope that I can see the stark modern furniture, not the colorful aristocratic style in front of me.\u201c\u2026I\u2019m going crazy.\u201dBut at that moment.\u201c?!\u201dA thud of doors. And\u2026\u201c!\u201dA man in a rush.Sitting on the railing, I was dragged down in a flash. I rolled on the floor in an ugly way, tangled together.\u201c\u2026?!\u201dHow did Kaelus run all the way here? And why is he being so rude?\u201cHmm\u2026.\u201d\u201c!\u201dA faint groan, or cry, through tight-lipped lips.Only then can I feel him hugging me and shaking.My confused mind is slowly cleared up. Let\u2019s deduce the situation before and after with a fairly calm mental state of mind.Oh, now I know. Why he was so surprised.\u201cUh\u2026\u201d\u201c!\u201dBut as soon as I open my mouth, his arms that are so tight around me tightened to the point that I can\u2019t breathe.I need to explain it quickly. It\u2019s not what you think.I didn\u2019t sit on the terrace railing to die, I just thought about how to return to my world.\u201c\u2026\u201dIs that it?How can I explain everything clearly to someone who doesn\u2019t even know I\u2019m a possessor?I feel sorry. I\u2019m terribly sorry that I made him have a wild imagination because he\u2019s still my favorite, even though I thought I hated Kaelus for a moment.Didn\u2019t I even promise him many times. I won\u2019t leave first, unless he urges me to.\u201cExcuse me, Kael\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dI secretly called him apologetically out of embarrassment, but he still remained silent with me in his arms.He must have misunderstood. I really didn\u2019t mean to die. I was just, \u2018going back.\u2019But an explanation will be useless. To do that, I have to reveal that I\u2019m a possessor.It\u2019s better to just shut up and calm down Kaelus.\u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m okay now\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry to surprise you.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201dYet increasingly tight arms, I was stuck in the arms of Kaelus and couldn\u2019t move.My face frowned with pain.\u201cKa, Kael\u2026 That\u2019s enough..\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dMy favorite who didn\u2019t even breathe. Are you holding your breath?Eventually, I was quiet, too. I have no choice but to wait until he releases his arms himself.The butler Uross and the servants, who entered the room before I knew it, were also timid and aware. I managed to gesture them out. Quietly they went out.\u201c\u2026Kael.\u201dI called Kaelus once again in a low voice.I tried to wriggle out of the way because I had to avoid rolling on the terrace floor somehow.Then came a faint voice.\u201cWhy\u2026\u201dI stopped moving reflexively. Only then did I feel something damp on my shoulders.\u201c\u2026\u201dMy favorite is crying.My heart throbbed suddenly. I\u2019m not that great of a human being. I can\u2019t believe I made my favorite cry.I bowed my head endlessly.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026 I\u2019m so sorry\u2026.\u201dI completely relaxed myself. I leaned my head against Kaelus\u2019 chest and murmured again.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kael\u2026\u2026.\u201dI made him cry.It\u2019s as painful as my heart is shattered.~~~~We sat in the room without saying a word to each other until the day was dark.Kaelus didn\u2019t allow me to move any farther. He looked at me with a distorted face the whole time, with our hands clasped tightly together.Whenever that happened, I eventually gave up and had no choice but to sit next to him calmly again.But I can\u2019t stay up all night like this. I talked to him carefully.\u201cI\u2019m\u2026 I\u2019m really not going to do anything, so can you let go of my hand for a second.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I promise.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt is heartbreaking to see Kaelus lifting his red eyes.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, Kael.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dTears quickly filled his purple eyes and fell on his face. I\u2019m sorry to break his heart, but even his crying is so pretty.I raised my hand and wiped his face slightly. My crying favorite was so pretty that I smiled faintly.\u201cI won\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t surprise you, so don\u2019t worry. Kaelus.\u201dHeavily distorted eyebrows with eyes full of water underneath.I smoothed the eyes without realizing it.How beautiful he is. The insidious thoughts of a fan spring from my mind. It\u2019s not bad to have him cry often.Such foolish thoughts in front of a person who is shedding tears from shock are proof that I have not yet fully accepted the world as my reality.But now, seriously, I must ask myself a question.How long am I going to live on the sidelines?Even though I have someone crying because of me in front of me, is this still a novel to me?Now that Kaelus has saved Diana, is he no longer my reason for life?\u201c\u2026\u201dThe faint smile subsided little by little.To be honest, I don\u2019t want to continue to see the novel that ends in a different way from the ending I want \u2013 exactly the secondary creation after the ending.But that\u2019s what I thought when I thought it was a novel, and if I recognized it as my new reality.I think that\u2019s the case with reality. A slightly bitter and uncomfortable ending with no hollow cider.To accept the ending where Diana is not deposed of is to acknowledge the reality that such a bitter ending is bound to be the best as a \u2018reality\u2019.Then I sincerely,Am I ready to abandon my original world and settle down with my mind in this novel?\u201cHess.\u201dOnce again, my face is blurred by the overflowing tears of my favorite.A violently shaken heart covers the front of my eyes.~~~~From that day on, Kaelus locked himself back in the room. What\u2019s different is that he won\u2019t leave my room, not his.Thanks to him, I didn\u2019t have a single moment alone.Clarice, the maid, flew meals to my room every time without a word of complaint.\u201cThank you, Clarice.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t mention it. Of course it\u2019s what I do.\u201dShe never lost her smile, even as she saw the unstable Kaelus again. a truly great sense of calm.I also asked my favorite in a calm tone.\u201cKael, would you like to come and eat with me?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe is remarkably silent, but he always responds to my call.I sounded deliberately bright as he approached the table.\u201cIt\u2019s full of things you like!\u201dThen his mouth opened after a long time.\u201cWhat do you like?\u201d\u201cOh\u2026?\u201dI paused at a sudden question. then.\u201cIs there anything I like? Of course.\u201dIs he about to call the lady-in-waiting with a cool face?I hurriedly stopped him.\u201cNo, I like them all, too!\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus was quiet again.But honestly, I had a limit to pretending to be no different than usual.Two thoughts fought fiercely in my heart. Will I accept that I should stop taking revenge on Diana? Or will I somehow find my way out of the world to stop*.*TN: to stop taking revengeAs hard as I tried to accept the novel as reality, psychology resisted fiercely.Naturally, amid the silence, he opened his mouth first.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dI answered mechanically.After a while, careful questions followed.\u201c\u2026 Shall we leave the capital for a while?\u201dThe unexpected words made my head raise. I stared at the purple eyes.\u201cLet\u2019s leave the noisy capital and go on a trip together so that we can focus only on each other.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt\u2019s a trip.It sounds nice, but on the other hand, isn\u2019t it a good excuse to run away?Leaving everything unattended and leaving here for a while to see a new landscape will not solve the war going on inside me. I\u2019d just delayed it for a while.But if I give him a proper answer, Kaelus will suffer less.\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201dI still love Kaelus. I emphasize again that everything I\u2019ve said to him so far was sincere.Let\u2019s remember from the beginning that I love him, but I don\u2019t crave to be loved by him.If the favorite can\u2019t wait and see Diana fall, it\u2019s up to me to accept it. Even if he took Diana\u2019s hand again, didn\u2019t I vow to be willing to bear it?It is entirely up to Kaelus to choose whether to forgive Diana or not. My role is just to stand behind him and support his choices.In the relationship between Kaelus, Diana and Helios, I\u2019m just an irrelevant third party. To put it more bluntly, it\u2019s just a reader who watches without intervention.We must not forget that.\u201cHestia.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHis voice is somehow trembling.\u201cWhat are you thinking? May I ask?\u201dI replied with a brazen face.\u201cI\u2019m thinking about what I decided to think about a while ago.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\u201cHaha, I\u2019m not thinking about anything crazy, so don\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dA ferociously pale face.Alas, I guess I\u2019ve brought him to the worst imagination yet again.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. My words were too light.\u201dConsidering the nonsense popping out, I\u2019m definitely out of my mind now.If I don\u2019t settle this mess quickly and come to a conclusion, I\u2019ll end up hurting my beloved Kaelus irrevocably.\u201cI\u2019ll give you an answer soon. Can you wait a little bit\u2026?\u201dWith an apologetic heart, I smiled softly.Kaelus slinked his head down.\u201cI\u2019m sorry\u2026\u201dI can\u2019t stand the rattling of my heart.~~~~When he had been in the same room for several days, the butler Uross said.\u201cWell, my lord. We have a visitor.\u201dKaelus answered, keeping his eyes on me lying in bed.\u201cI won\u2019t see them. Send them back.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Mr. Hyperion.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care who it is.\u201dKaelus turned his white face to the butler.\u201cTell him to go back.\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t do that, Kael.\u201d\u201c!\u201dThe butler was embarrassed by the sudden voice, and Kaelus made a fierce impression.I was lying under the covers and stood up.\u201cWelcome, Mr. Hyperion.\u201dThe butler quietly closed the door and walked away when I, the room owner, greeted him.I said to Helios with a smile on my face.\u201cHis highness, the crown prince, came to you personally, and it is not a good thing to send him back. You\u2019re here to see my husband, so you two can talk.\u201dHelios came, so I was honestly relieved. If not, when will Kaelus leave?Slowly I leaned out of bed, and as expected, he grabbed me like a baby.\u201cHess!\u201d\u201cHis Highness is here, Kael.\u201dI wrung out my favorite\u2019s hand. Then I roughly put the shawl on the wall over my shoulder.\u201cI\u2019ll get some fresh air in the garden.\u201dWithout looking back, I came out of the room.~~~~\u201cPhew\u2026.\u201dMaybe I had made her favorite person too dependent. Sitting on a bench in the garden, I reflected on my past.I don\u2019t think I did anything particularly to be his hands and feet. Wasn\u2019t all I did at best was watching the domestic affairs on behalf of Kaelus and to screw up the heroine and the male lead?\u201c\u2026\u201dDespite the affection shown by Kaelus, I still had no attachment to this damn world.In the end, I failed to bring Diana down to the floor, and Kaelus, who is on their side after being beaten by Diana and Helios, is cold-blooded.To be honest, if he stayed still, it would have been my wish. Why am I so distressed by him coming forward and not staying still?The answer, however, is quite simple.\u201cOf course. Kaelus was giving everything to Diana from the original\u2026\u201dI tore the grass out of the complexity of my feelings.I\u2019ve decided to accept whatever Kaelus does. I even vowed to accept his choice of Diana again.But it was all based on her proper remorse and apology.So I may be even more struggling with Kaelus\u2019 decision, unable to admit that Diana\u2019s \u201capology\u201d at the moment.\u201cBy the way, the story takes quite a while\u2026\u201cThere\u2019s so much to say between you two. Helios seems to be saying thank you for saving Diana.It\u2019s bitter. In the end, Kaelus saved them again.It was all my favorite\u2019s thing to do, to bring down the Duke Orcus family for the two, and to protect Diana, who was to be deposed in the perfect cause.\u201cI look like a fool.\u201dMy heart aches.Then I looked up at the approaching person.\u201cHelios\u2026\u201dI murmured softly in my mouth without realizing it.Having finished talking to Kaelus, he came to me sitting in the garden in a long robe.I don\u2019t need manners because he\u2019s here as Hyperion anyway. I stared up at him.Helios sat next to me with a long sigh.\u201cYou\u2019re deeply hurt, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dIt can\u2019t be expressed as heartbroken, but I didn\u2019t deny it because it was old.\u201cKael must have been very surprised, too. I didn\u2019t expect you to be so discouraged.\u201dHe\u2019s so relaxed when he\u2019s released after being cornered.I smirked.\u201cI guess you can\u2019t get out of the woods without Kaelus. It was the Duke Orcus, and this time.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios said nothing.There is no reason to be in one place with Helios, who I don\u2019t want to see. I stood up, closing my shawl.\u201cGo home safely.\u201d\u201cI asked for it.\u201d\u201c?\u201dI stopped moving at a moment\u2019s notice at a sudden outburst of words.The golden eyes of Helios stared straight at me.\u201cI persuaded him to stay neutral for a few days. Yeah. Like you said, there was no other way but Kael.\u201d\u201c\u2026.\u201d\u201cYou can call me names for being incompetent. But I hope you don\u2019t misunderstand. It\u2019s not that he hasn\u2019t forgotten Diana.\u201dI ended up laughing out loud.\u201cIs that what he says? I\u2019m misunderstanding?\u201d\u201cAt least, I don\u2019t think you believe in his true feelings. Because you know so much about Kael\u2019s past.\u201d\u201cI mean, I still believe he loves Diana.\u201d\u201cIs he wrong?\u201dWhen Helios asked me, I nodded with an expression that I was perfectly natural.\u201cYes. Totally.\u201d\u201cThen why don\u2019t you listen to what he\u2019s saying?\u201dI gave a cold answer.\u201cBecause it wasn\u2019t the end I wanted. How much humility do you think a person who has never fallen to the bottom can learn?\u201d\u201cIf what you want is for Diana to come down from the crown princess.\u201dHelios seemed to try not to raise his voice.\u201cThere could be other ways, even if it\u2019s not a dethronement. My relationship with Diana is the worst right now.\u201dI looked at him still. It\u2019s a different road.\u201cFor example, divorce?\u201dWhen explicitly referring to \u2018divorce\u2019, Helios frowned slightly but did not deny it.\u201cOf course I don\u2019t want a divorce. Even if I get along with Diana like a stranger, I don\u2019t plan to break up right away.\u201dI was dumbfounded.\u201cWhat are you trying to convince me that there\u2019s another way, if you can\u2019t give up your crown princess?\u201dIt doesn\u2019t add up at all. He said that there is another way for me besides resigning to the throne, and that he would not divorce even if he lived like a stranger.What the hell are you going to do?\u201cHestia.\u201dHelios stuck tenaciously.\u201cIt must be boring, but I\u2019ll ask you again. What do you really want? Diana and I falling to the bottom?\u201dWhy do you ask me if I know you well?But Helios continued.\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Think about it, Hestia.\u201d\u201c?\u201dI frowned and tried to grasp what Helios was saying.What do I really want? Needless to say, Diana lost everything and desperately regretted it.Wait.Okay.\u201c\u2026!\u201dRegretting.To regret falling to the ground that the heroine had abandoned Kael. And to sincerely apologize.In fact, the reason I wanted Diana to be empty is because she can only realize what she has gained thanks to Kael only when she loses everything and falls to the floor.\u201cHestia, do you understand? What you really want is literally not Diana\u2019s abdication.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yeah, it\u2019s more fundamental.\u201dI had no choice but to admit it. I don\u2019t know if I was caught up in Helios\u2019 words or not.Helios smiled bitterly.\u201cLet\u2019s be honest. If Diana is deposed, will she immediately reflect on her mistake as you wish?\u201dHe speaks very bitterly about his once-loved wife.Funny thing is, I have no choice but to agree with his conclusions.\u201cOkay. What do you want to say?\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean your purpose will be ruined if you don\u2019t dispose of Diana. On the contrary, abdicating does not necessarily make your wish come true.\u201dHe sighed briefly and went on again.\u201cEverything doesn\u2019t work out in a moment. Perhaps Diana\u2019s true \u2018apology\u2019 that you want is to achieve over time with endless reflection.\u201dThe golden eyes looked at me solemnly.\u201cI won\u2019t ask you to stop your anger. But for sure, Diana and I will regret it for many years to come, and we will check ourselves from time to time not to repeat the same mistake again.\u201dPerhaps Helios\u2019 way of \u2018regret\u2019 is more realistic.Rather than regretting and forgetting about a single event, living a short life and not forgetting every moment and regretting it deeply may be more like the fundamental \u2018Diana\u2019s penitence\u2019 I want.\u201cHestia, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll regret it. And for a very long time, I\u2019ll live with the heart that I owe to Kael. No one knows which path Diana and I will take.\u201dWhether the female protagonist and the male protagonist continue to live together uncomfortably, or divorce and move on their separate ways.Or isn\u2019t it life that we can forgive each other for a long time and continue the couple\u2019s relationship.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to be too disappointed that Kael stopped Diana from being deposed right now. Hestia.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cTrust him more than that. He\u2019s shaking with genuine fear now.\u201dI jerked my head around to cover up the rising tears.\u201cKael isn\u2019t the kind of person who\u2019s going to collapse that much.\u201d\u201cNo, you are more precious to Kael than you think.\u201dHelios said firmly, but he smiled in vain as if something was absurd.\u201cShall I speak plainly? Even if Diana clung to him, he wouldn\u2019t blink. Because you\u2019ve already become irreplaceable as Diana.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dI also opened my mouth. I can\u2019t believe he can say so calmly that his wife is hanging on to another man. Helios\u2019\u00a0 mental state must be unique.\u201cWell, we\u2019ll take care of our couple\u2019s affairs. There\u2019s only one thing I\u2019d like to ask. Please don\u2019t leave him.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s really surprised. First of all, he\u2019s kicking himself hard.\u201dTears fell out of my eyes. I tried so hard not to cry in front of Helios.\u201cHestia, you are wise unlike us. You really love him.\u201dHelios\u2019 tone was soft and strangely lonely.He reached out and opened the shawl that had hung narrowly over my shoulder.\u201c\u2026please take good care of Kael.\u201dHis true feelings were conveyed, and eventually I nodded.\u201cYes, I\u2019ll be by his side.\u201dHelios\u2019 fingertips fell off the shawl as if there were some lingering feelings.\u201cThank you, Hestia.\u201dHe replied with a faint smile.~~~~I broke up from Helios and came back to my room. When I opened the door carefully, I saw my favorite sitting helplessly against the sofa.\u201cKael.\u201d\u201c\u2026Hess.\u201dHis eyes, which slowly raise his head, are red again. I guess he cried again in the meantime.I approached him, struggling to suppress my rattling heart.\u201cI thought about it while I was outside.\u201dI leaned my head gently on his shoulder.\u201cThe trip is a bit of a burden because there\u2019s so much work, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea to stay in Attica for a while.\u201d\u201c!\u201dKaelus\u2019 body trembled.I put my hand on the back of his hand. Gently tucking my rough fingers between his long, thin fingers.\u201cYou\u2019re right. We need time to focus and care more about us, away from the capital for a while.\u201dTo be honest, my inner conflict has not all been resolved.However, when it is complicated in many ways, I should simplify my thoughts with the single most important topic.The most precious thing to me in this world is, of course, Kaelus. From the moment I returned, I was determined to devote my life to Kaelus again.No need for anything else, just think of Kaelus.Something my favorite would be happy about.Let me focus my life solely on him.\u201cI\u2019ll just think about how you and I will be happier. I\u2019m so sorry to have worried you.\u201dI added awkwardly, clasping my fingers on the back of his hand.\u201cAnd I wasn\u2019t really going to fall to death at the time.\u201dFor me, the meaning of \u201cgoing back\u201d is the same as \u201cdeath\u201d for him who belongs to this world, but if I don\u2019t say it in detail, isn\u2019t it enough?I just don\u2019t want Kaelus to be afraid of my absence any more. Also, I want to cleanly erase the guilt that I wanted to die from him.Even if I don\u2019t reveal all the truth here.From now on, I will spend a long time with Kaelus and walk on an exciting journey to reveal each other\u2019s secrets one by one.\u201cKael, so no more\u2026 Will you smile?\u201dAt that moment, the clasped hands slipped away and they met. A gentle but strong pull. Without resisting, he held me in his arms.I\u2019m really grateful for the sound that occurs when the two hearts meet.\u201cHestia, I\u2026.\u201dThe trembling voice mixed with tears again.I guess it\u2019s up to me to make him laugh.\u201cI love you, Kael.\u201dThe only center of my life. The only purpose of my life.My favorite that can\u2019t be exchanged for anything, and above all, is precious.He was once abandoned, but I will never abandon him.\u201cMe, too, Hess. Me, too.\u2026 I love you.\u201dKaelus sobbing and confessing.I tried to make him laugh.I\u2019m going to stop crying.~~~~The morning after we woke up in the same bed. Kaelus called the butler Uross to announce our journey to Attica.\u201cWe\u2019re planning to leave the capital for the time being and stay in Attica.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026! I see, my lord.\u201dUross looked very relieved. For a few days, Kaelus and I looked scruffy, and they worried out of sight.Attica was located in the northern part of the empire, far from the capital. It wasn\u2019t half a day\u2019s walk like Illion.I wrote a long letter to Countess Erinnis as the men of the mansion busily began to prepare for the trip.\u201cThe abdication of the crown princess failed, but she almost lost her strength anyway. I think my and your efforts have paid off\u2026\u201dI emphasized that our efforts so far have not been in vain. And I consoled the hard work I had done. Even if I don\u2019t make a commitment to check on Diana, she\u2019ll do well on her own.\u201cAnd\u2026 I decided to spend more time with my husband. I will stay at Attica estate for a while. I\u2019ll say hello from time to time.\u201dI finished writing the letter. Somehow I feel a bittersweet.Before and after the return, it seems that the first act of life in this world is finally over.I\u2019ve just finished the first chapter that I ran without hesitation in revenge for Kaelus\u2019 death, and now I start a new chapter 2 of myself and the person I love the most.\u201cHa\u2026.\u201dExcitement, anticipation, and a little fear of the future.It\u2019s a lie if I say I don\u2019t have any worries about how much I would like the pure self I am without foresight or anything.However, we have to overcome this with trust and affection.You should love each other completely by your existence, not by your ability or condition.This is what true love is.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 44": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA long-distance carriage trip was a lot harder than I imagined.Romantic moments, as described in the common rofan novels, are only a brief moment, and most of the moments are battles with tremendous shaking, motion sickness, and boredom on unpaved roads.Still, in my case, there were few disadvantages of boredom. Think about it! It\u2019s rather strange to sit next to my favorite all day in a small space and not get excited!However, I thought of something to relieve my boredom because I would be embarrassed if I kept looking into Kaelus\u2019 face. It\u2019s knitting!As soon as possible, I put the knitting tools I had received from Clarice on my lap and began to knit a scarf that could be worn around in the cold weather. To be honest, I don\u2019t know how to knit anything but a scarf.Reading while wearing glasses \u2013 despite this uncomfortable ride, is great \u2013 Kaelus looked across me.\u201cWhat should I make?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a scarf. I\u2019m just bored with my hands.\u201d\u201cWhose?\u201dIt\u2019s a question in an indifferent tone, but I can feel a subtle expectation in that tone.I replied with a grin.\u201cIf it\u2019s ruined, it\u2019s mine, if it\u2019s not ruined, it\u2019s yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe looks dissatisfied, but even if I die, I can\u2019t let him wear a ruined scarf around his neck. It was enough with the last kravat.Kaelus opened the window of the carriage. Cool air rushed in.\u201cThe air is definitely different because it\u2019s north.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dKaelus nodded slowly.It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not, it\u2019s really different from the temperature. Unlike the capital, which has mild weather all year round except for a brief rainy season, the weather in northern Attica was basically \u201ccold.\u201d If the weather was a bit bad, a blizzard was sure to swirl with the storm.So people from Attica are famous for their survival within the empire. There are also many brave warriors.Seeing the window of the carriage open, the escort came close.\u201cIf we keep going at this pace, we\u2019ll be able to stay overnight in a nearby town and enter the Attica estate tomorrow, duke.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI frowned slightly at the words.It still will take another day. It\u2019s really far. We\u2019ve been in a carriage for five days already.Kaelus smiled quietly, as if he saw my expression.\u201cThe hard journey will soon be over. Hang in there a little longer, Hess.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dIn fact, it doesn\u2019t take this long to run fast on a horse. However, due to the long-term departure from the imperial city, there was a lot of luggage and many people to take, so I was intentionally moving around with a loose schedule.In front and back of the duchy carriage, where I and Kaelus were riding, there was a carriage with the servants, including Clarice. Including the men escorting the carriage, the party bound for Attica was by no means small.In proportion to the temperature of the cooling air, the scenery outside also became quite monotonous. Instead of colorful flowers and trees, elongated conifers increased in number.\u201cAttica is barren and doesn\u2019t feed itself well. Therefore, trade with other territories and mercenary businesses are very important.\u201d\u201cDuke Orcus was only interested in the mercenary business. Because of that, the people\u2019s livelihood was very difficult.\u201d\u201cI can see right away what I have to do. We need to solve the food problem first.\u201dKaelus smiled softly.\u201cYou\u2019ll be a really great lady.\u201d\u201cHa ha, thank you. Kael.\u201d~~~~We stayed one night in the last village and set off leisurely. All of the party looked excited as we were about to enter Attica.I opened the carriage window in anticipation. It was not long ago that snow fell, and the snow that did not melt was piled up white on the side of the road.Suddenly the carriage stopped.\u201c?\u201dWhile I was wondering, Kaelus asked the escort.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cA group of horses are coming close. The officials of the estate seem to have come to meet the lady.\u201dSoon, people wearing thick fur coats came to the carriage and stopped. Kaelus and I stepped out of the carriage.\u201cGreetings to Duchess Hestia!\u201dA group of people bent at once with a disciplined movement.I glanced at Caelus in bewilderment, it felt as if I had become the boss of an organization, and he nodded quietly.It\u2019s a little scary, but I plucked up my courage.\u201cThank you for coming all the way to meet me. This is my husband, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cGreetings to Duke Kaelus!\u201dSomething very simple but powerful. Is this the way the North is?Kaelus responded with a short, dry response as usual.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dOne of them lifted a large load from the horse.\u201cYou won\u2019t last long in that outfit. You have to wear this coat in the North.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u201cIt was a fur coat similar to the one worn by the people of that organization. I handed one to Kaelus, and I put one on. It\u2019s definitely warm.Come to think of it, what did Madame Harmonia do in front of such big men? When I meet her later, I\u2019ll have to comfort her for her hard work..\u201cWe\u2019ll lead the way, my lady.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll catch up.\u201dI ordered each carriage to follow in the footsteps of the estate officials. Behind a group of horses, a long procession soon followed.The coat was as heavy as its thickness. My shoulders drooped automatically.\u201c\u2026we\u2019ll get used to it in the future, right?\u201d\u201cIf you wear it often, you\u2019ll get used to it soon. Maybe we should take a walk together more often.\u201dKaelus replied with a grin.We finally stepped on the boundaries of the Attica estate. The surroundings were still desolate, but nomadic people stood out in a vast area.\u201cWow\u2026.\u201dThe first thought that came to mind. How the hell do they farm in this land? It is time to put back my ambition to solve the food problem.Kaelus seems to be a similar sentiment.\u201cThere won\u2019t be many crops left to survive.\u201d\u201cI think I touched something tough, right?\u201dMumbling in a slightly jaded tone, he encouraged me gently.\u201cYou\u2019ll do a good job. I will do my best to help you.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u201dAfter running for a long time, I finally saw the village.A member of the coat gang came up to the car window and said,\u201cThis is the town where the permanent residence is located.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dUnlike the empty surroundings, the more the village approached, the more developed the street appeared. A landscape almost like a small city.There were strong buildings along the road that could prevent snowstorms. Many people tied dogs to carts instead of horses. They all have thick fur coats and hats in common.\u201cIf you go to the mountains, you never know when a snowstorm will hit you.\u201dOne of the guides explained.The young people of Attica stopped and looked at our party as the carriage procession passed.Expectations for a new lady who will help them expand their lives. Even the trust that we will protect their safe and cozy home. This was the impression reflected in their eyes.I finally arrived at the permanent building. It was my house where Kaelus and I will stay.There was a welcome face in front of the gate. It was Madam Harmonia in a fur coat.\u201cI see the great duchess of the empire.\u201dI couldn\u2019t stop laughing at her, who was thoroughly polite even though I hadn\u2019t seen her in a long time.\u201cMadam Harmonia is still the same. How have you been?\u201d\u201cHaha, thanks to the duchess, I\u2019m enjoying my days without any inconvenience.\u201dUnder the direction of the maid Clarice, the servants began to diligently unpack.In a rather cluttered state, Harmonia guided us to the permanent residence. Kaelus gently held my hand and looked around the new house.\u201cBefore the duke and the duchess arrived, we renovated the mansion in general. You won\u2019t feel like it\u2019s been empty for a long time.\u201dI asked carefully what I was worried about.\u201cDon\u2019t the people of Attica resent Kaelys?\u201dMy concern was quite natural, as it was my favorite who handed over a poison tea to Duke Orcus, the former lord of this estate.But Harmonia shook her head still.\u201cFortunately, the former lord is not a man of high reputation, so the people of the land expect more from the new lady. If the duchess does the same thing as taking care of Illion\u2019s affairs, the people here may praise you as a saint.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha\u2026 do as much as Ilion\u2026.\u201dDamn it. It\u2019s not gonna be easy.The permanent residence was much larger than the duchy of the capital in terms of the size of the mansion. There are two separate houses, and the backyard is so wide that it was rather a forest.Is this the scale of the North? Kaelus looked surprised, too.\u201cIt\u2019s very wide.\u201d\u201cYes, duke. Foreigners who visit Attica usually stay for a few days or months, so they built many rooms like this. I usually use the detached house for that purpose.\u201dWell, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be the only one with visitors. There will be attendants, escorts, and even horses in carriage.I mourned quietly in my heart. It is clear that the employees who followed the duke will suffer from managing the mansion in the future.And I thanked Harmonia, who came first and laid the groundwork before we arrived.\u201cThanks to Madam, I entered Attica without a hitch. You\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d\u201cHo-ho, the residents are tough, but they\u2019re honest. I\u2019m sure the duke and the duchess will love this place.\u201dShe was sure with a clear expression.I answered, too, facing Kaelus.\u201cYes, I think so.\u201dIt\u2019s better to be able to hold hands like this all the time under the pretext of being cold.This is how Attica\u2019s first day went.~~~~Life in Attica began in earnest.First of all, I tried to fix up Attica\u2019s tattered internal affairs one by one, taking advantage of the experience built up by the Illion internal affairs.Madam Harmonia was in charge of communicating their needs to me by meeting with the estate officials and residents in person. Thanks to her exceptional talent for building relationships, I was able to communicate with the commoners without having to meet them in person.The operation of a private clinic and a medical training center in imperial city was led by the duchy\u2019s doctor as the \u201cdirector.\u201d He was so enthusiastic that I had little to worry about.Kaelus also took a room in the permanent residence as his office and completely took over Illion\u2019s internal affairs. Illion officials were uncomfortable traveling long distances, but the cold lord, Kaelus, did not mind.I got used to the cold weather. In addition to the coats presented by the guide, the thick fur clothes worn by Kaelus and I increased one by one.I often exchanged letters with the capital. I sent news and greetings to butler Uross and Countess Erinnis. Kaelus mainly contacted the emperor and Helios. It was because his opinion was needed in the management of state affairs.But it wasn\u2019t really this job that accounted for most of Attica daily life.\u201cKael, wasn\u2019t it cold last night?\u201d\u201cWell, not at all.\u201dEven under the covers, this naked man really doesn\u2019t look cold at all.His arm was tightly wrapped around my waist.\u201cIt\u2019s very warm thanks to your temperature.\u201d\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201dNo lies, except for the time each of us spent three or four hours doing public affairs, we were together every minute and every second without falling apart.Kaelus naturally learned more about me.\u201cWhy do you like soup so much?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you feel better when you eat something hot on a cold day?\u201d\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but you\u2019re the only one who dips rice in it and eats it.\u201dSeems like you don\u2019t know. Rice soup is absolutely the best in this cold weather.Kaelus suddenly looked sorry.\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat this much in the capital.\u201d\u201cOh, the imperial city wasn\u2019t cold enough to crave this food. I didn\u2019t really think of it.\u201dI chuckled.\u201cBut I never knew you were so good with swords. Why didn\u2019t you show me swordplay once?\u201dIn the original novel, there was at least one scene where Helios and Kaelus faced swords and engaged in a war of nerves over Diana, but in reality, it was more than I imagined. He\u2019s not just mimicking, he\u2019s really good at swinging his sword.Kaelus replied awkwardly.\u201cI\u2019m just practicing for my stamina. But come to think of it, I haven\u2019t really used a sword since I married you.\u201dTouching his chin, Kaelus pondered.\u201cI\u2019ve been busy with my work for months since I returned to politics\u2026 When I was with Heli, I spent most of my time fighting. Is that why?\u201d\u201c?\u201dSuddenly he smiled at me.\u201cI think my lifestyle has changed a little because I\u2019m away from Heli and I\u2019m stuck with you. But if you want, I\u2019ll show you the sword often.\u201d\u201cOh, good!\u201dHer favorite body type is definitely slimmer than Helios. Unlike Helios, where you could tell that his muscles have developed even when he was wearing clothes, her favorite\u2019s figure is slimmer at first glance.Of course, the story of Kaelus was completely different when he took off his clothes.\u201cAnd you have to see a doctor after eating. Hestia.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the stern tone of Kaelus made me look sad.\u201cIt will be our second wedding anniversary soon. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve\u2026.\u201dKaelus briefly muddled his words. You\u2019re probably thinking about my return.\u201c\u2026I remember you collapsed in the temple at this time, so don\u2019t let your guard down even if you\u2019re healthy now.\u201d\u201cWell, but it\u2019s really fine. At this rate, I won\u2019t get sick.\u201dI deliberately retorted back to reassure him.But he shook his head.\u201cI can\u2019t relax until I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be safe.\u201dIt\u2019s a little annoying, but what can\u2019t I do if he feels uncomfortable?\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see a doctor after I eat, so you can join me.\u201dKaelus replied with a heavy nod.After a while, we sat face to face with the doctor.\u201cThe duchess is as healthy as she was yesterday, duke.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKaelus, who is relieved only for one day after hearing the expert\u2019s opinion. But tomorrow, we have to hear what tomorrow says.Actually, my concern is separate.\u201cDixie, is there a case where pregnancy is not going well despite being this healthy?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s more common than you think. Duchess, don\u2019t worry too much, just relax.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t think it\u2019s because Kaelus and I aren\u2019t working hard enough. Rather, we do it almost every night.But if my anxiety about pregnancy stems purely from my desire to have children, Kaelus\u2019s anxiety is a little different.Worried that I would die like before the regression, he worried that even this phenomenon was a sign of my death.A frosty voice headed to the innocent doctor.\u201cIf anything is wrong with my wife, don\u2019t hesitate to tell her.\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026!\u201dAfter leaving the doctor, I walked through the woods behind the mansion, holding Kaelus\u2019 hand.\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Kael.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I have a very strong feeling that everything will be fine.\u201dI\u2019m not lying. Seriously, these days, I wonder if this is the real reason why I\u2019ve been possessed and returned.The reason I thought was the salvation of Kaelus.It seems that the author of the original novel is not the same as the god of the world. What power does the rofan author have to make me, a reader, immerse myself in his work and even return in it?Then it means that there\u2019s a separate subject called \u201cGod\u201d.But more important to me than who the god is, why should I continue to live in this world?Why am I living in this world. Why does God keep me here.There was no clear answer anywhere. Still, it was possible to find answers metaphorically through life here.It\u2019s Kaelus. There was no reason for me to live in this world except for Kaelus.If God had sent me here for my abandoned favorite, there would be no reason to let me leave here suddenly without doing it for him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kael. I\u2019ll be fine as long as you\u2019re alive.\u201dHe asked me back with a not-so-bright face, as I said with a smile.\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just how it feels.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo matter what I say, he will never be relieved. Before regression, until I safely passed the point of my death.~~~~Months passed like the wind. Finally, we celebrated our second wedding anniversary.However, it was not just a day to celebrate the second year of marriage. It was a day when I was happy to survive in this world safely, changing the future before my return.In front of the table, which is not as fancy as the capital, we drank a toast.\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve been married for two years, but most of all, I\u2019m grateful that you survived safely.\u201dKaelus said in an emotionally trembling voice.I also responded with a smile.\u201cWhat did I tell you? I told you everything would be fine.\u201dHe tilted his head.\u201cBut I\u2019m really curious. How could you be so sure?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s a special feeling for the regressor\u2026?\u201dPerhaps the answer was not as great as expected, Kaelus grimaced.I made up for it with a smile.\u201cHa ha, I don\u2019t know exactly. But I think you\u2019re the reason I had to go back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the reason?\u201dPretty purple eyes glistened with water again.I smiled brightly.\u201cI never expected a return. But just before I died, and after I returned, the first thing that came to my mind was none other than you.\u201dThe beginning and end of this life as Hestia has always been Kaelus. Even when I close my eyes.And even at the moment I opened my eyes.Even every breath I take, I always think of Kaelus.It\u2019s impossible for me to pursue my own life apart from him.Are my words uncomfortable? Does it feel foolish to live only for others and not for myself?But that\u2019s not true. I am extremely happy, and it is unbearably painful to pursue a life of my own withoutKaelus.\u201cEveryone must have a purpose to be born in this land. Maybe it\u2019s you for me.\u201dIt\u2019s not \u2018maybe\u2019, it\u2019s actually an immovable conviction.But Kaelus confesses the same as I do.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who saved me from dying. I got the rest of my life entirely thanks to you.\u201dHis lips touched me still.\u201cYou\u2019re the owner of the rest of my life. So please be with me forever.\u201dI gently hugged his neck with my arms.\u201cNo matter where you go or what you do, I will never leave you.\u201dI\u2019m a little scared and nervous about living a new life that I\u2019ve never repeated.However, I am not lonely because I have a companion walking with me.What kind of adventure will we have tomorrow?My heart just swells with anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It goes without saying how excellent the choice was.One day, about a year after our second wedding anniversary.It was nice to see the warm weather. I took a walk around the neighborhood with Kaelus.\u201cThe potato crop has increased, so everyone likes it.\u201d\u201cIt went well to trade Attica\u2019s forest products for Illion\u2019s crops. Both territories were satisfied.\u201dWhen I returned home talking with him, I received an urgent call from imperial city.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cHmm. Heli sent it.\u201dReading the letter, Kaelus\u2019 face darkened.\u201cThe emperor\u2019s condition is not very good.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dHe was like a father to him. He often referred to Kaelus as his 'second son\u201d in public.I clasped his hand.\u201cLet\u2019s go to imperial city. You could really regret it if you hesitate.\u201d\u201cYeah, I should.\u201dThe road prepared us for a hasty departure to the capital. I had to move quickly, so I packed my clothes with the least amount of luggage and personnel.~~~~It\u2019s been a long time since we left the land of snow and ice and headed south. At the time of coming to Attica, the road, which took almost a week, was shortened to three days this time.At last we reached the duchy of the capital. However, far from relieving the fatigue, Kaelus and I rushed to the palace without having time to greet the servants who had kept the house.There were already a considerable number of aristocrats gathered in the Lion Palace. When we appeared, there were sighs and buzzes here and there.Countess Erinnis greeted me with a handkerchief wiping tears.\u201cDuchess Hestia! Duke Kaelus!\u201d\u201cAh, Countess\u2026!\u201dIt was not a situation to greet peacefully, so I briefly asked about the state of the emperor.\u201cWhat happened to his majesty?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been debilitating, but his condition has suddenly deteriorated over the past few days. The courtiers are all stuck, but he really needs to prepare himself this time.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dKaelus\u2019 face turned almost earthy.\u201cI must go to see his majesty right away, Hess.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m coming with you.\u201dWe hurried to the emperor\u2019s bedroom. I reached the bedroom door, past a corridor heavily guarded by guards.\u201cTell him Kaelus, the lord of Illion, and Hestia, the lady of Attica, to see him.\u201dThe chief bowed deeply, and after being polite, he hurried inside.\u201cCome on in.\u201dKaelus exchanged glances with me for a moment, and then stepped carefully so that there was no sound of footsteps.I could see the bed in which the emperor was lying.\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe white-faced Diana looked at us and rose silently. an expression on the verge of tears The sea-colored eyes were already filled with tears.Kaelus approached the emperor without giving her an eye.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dPerhaps he had just come to his senses in his voice, the emperor confirmed him with his dim eyes.\u201cAh\u2026 Kaelus\u2026.\u201dA weak hand shook on the quilt. Kaelus managed to notice it and clasped his hand tightly.I think we need to move out for the two of them now.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut that tactless Diana is always the problem. She was standing next to the bed as if he were stuck with a handkerchief and only shedding tears.It can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s been a while since we saw each other, but you and I must be destined to bump into each other every time we see.I boldly talked to him.\u201cYour highness the crown princess. Why don\u2019t we go out for a while?\u201d\u201c?\u201dHer fine eyebrows were slightly distorted. But when I looked at her with force in my eyes, she nodded gently.I kissed Kaelus lightly.\u201cKael, see you later\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe nodded in silence.~~~~Coming out, Diana and I looked away in silence from each other.Judging from her attitude, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s properly reflecting on herself yet as Helios said.Do you still need more time? It\u2019s hard to change a person in a few years.Still, let\u2019s take a peek to see how much she has taken steps to reflect on herself.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I saw you, your grace.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. Long time no see.\u201dIt\u2019s cold. This is the end of the progress check.I should have pushed her to abdication, but Kaelus broke down. For a moment, old resentment rises.\u201c\u2026.\u201dBut while I was spending time with Kaelus and Attica, I changed my mind a lot.He was absolutely right. It was much more important to think only about what we would make us happy among ourselves, regardless of what others did. It\u2019s actually overwhelming to just care about that.So I decided not to take Diana\u2019s reaction to heart.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dShe made a sudden noise next to me, and I turned my head in surprise.Helios was approaching at a rapid pace, perhaps hearing our news.\u201cThe great sun of the empire\u2026\u201d\u201cHestia. Is Kaelus inside?\u201dThe habit of cutting off the cumbersome etiquette is still there. I answered quickly.\u201cYes, his majesty has left his seat for a quiet conversation with my husband.\u201d\u201cI see. Whoo\u2026\u201dHelios sighed with great relief.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cHmm? Ah, I\u2026\u2026 I was glad you guys came before it was too late.\u201dI honestly don\u2019t know what to say to Helios, who smiles bitterly. What should I say to the person who has his dying father in front of him?It is a pity that life experience is far short at times like this.In the end, after thinking and thinking, I barely gave him this word.\u201cHis Majesty will wake up.\u201dAlthough the expression is corny, I hope my apologetic heart can be conveyed.Fortunately, Helios took my consolation.\u201cI hope so, too. Thank you, Hestia.\u201dThen the door opened and the palace chief appeared. Helios and Diana, who were standing in front of him, turned their heads in surprise.\u201cYour highness the crown prince. His majesty is calling.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201dWhen he went inside, Diana and I were left alone in the hallway again.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe awkwardness that came again. I just have to think of Diana as a person who doesn\u2019t exist.I don\u2019t have the heart to make up with her. Of course, I didn\u2019t just do nice things when I confronted her. But just as she doesn\u2019t want to apologize, I don\u2019t really reflect on my actions either.Yes, I can\u2019t force Diana to reflect on herself when I don\u2019t reflect on myself.It\u2019s just that until she realizes what\u2019s wrong with her, Kaelus and I have to live with our own happiness.To be honest, it takes energy to hate constantly.When I spent a long time alone in various thoughts.As the tightly closed door opened, Kaelus and Helios reappeared.I quickly approached my favorite.\u201cKael.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026\u201dKaelus looked very tired.Then Helios said to us, \u201cI\u2019ll call the two of you soon. Until then, stay in imperial city for now.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dI answered on behalf of Kael.Helios turned his back and disappeared down the hall.\u201c\u2026\u201dDiana looked at us for a moment, and then silently returned to the emperor.I held the cold hands of Kaelus.\u201cWe\u2019re going back, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dHe took my hand and walked weakly.~~~~After a long time, we laid together on the bed of the duke\u2019s mansion.Kaelus opened his mouth with a heavy face.\u201cHis majesty\u2026\u201dWhen Kaelus blurted the end of his words, I waited silently for the words to follow.\u201c\u2026 He wanted me to remain in the capital.\u201d\u201c!\u201dOnly then did I realize why he had such a dark look on his face.You must have feared that I would be troubled by confrontation with Diana in the noisy capital. In particular, I think I caused a suicide disturbance in front of my favorite. Maybe he\u2019s afraid of life in the capital.However, to turn a blind eye to this and go back to Attica to make us happy, I am concerned about the emperor\u2019s request, which is like a will.I asked cautiously.\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2026.\u201dHe shook his head as if he didn\u2019t know.Nevertheless, I can clearly feel his heart shaking. Can I help you with your decision?\u201cKael, I promised I\u2019d follow you wherever you went. Whether it\u2019s Attica or the capital, now I\u2019m happy wherever I am with you.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know what to do, stay in the capital for the rest of your life. We can think about what to do later.\u201dIn fact, I still don\u2019t care much about anyone other than Kaelus. Whatever happens to the emperor or not, it\u2019s enough as long as I\u2019m happy with my favorite.But I don\u2019t want to burden him in return for my happiness.Moreover, the emperor does not have much time left. To ease Kaelus\u2019s mind, that much is willing to yield.\u201cLet\u2019s do that, Kael.\u201dI urged him once again.After a long sigh, Kaelus nodded slowly.\u201cThank you, Hestia. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll probably stay in the capital a little longer. I\u2019m very sorry to just reject his majesty\u2019s words.\u201d\u201cYes, I feel the same way.\u201dThis extended our capital schedule a little bit.The next day, Helios brought Kaelus and I to the palace.\u201cYou must have been very surprised to hear the news out of the blue. But thank you for coming quickly.\u201dHe poured tea in front of Kaelus and coffee in front of me.Raising the teacup, Kaelus asked.\u201cIs there a reason why his majesty got worse so quickly?\u201d\u201cAccording to the court doctor, a person who has been bedridden for a long time can be affected by a very minor cause in an instant.\u201dHelios replied with a complex look.The emperor was less than fifty years old, even for his parents\u2019 generation. However, due to his long illness, he looked much older on the outside.In this world where modern medicine is not developed, the average life expectancy is extremely short, around the age of three to forty. Perhaps that\u2019s why people think the emperor is enduring for a sick person.Kaelus spoke slowly.\u201cYesterday, his Majesty asked me to remain in the capital.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios shook his head in silence.\u201cSo I discussed it with Hess yesterday, and I decided to stay in the imperial city for a while.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dLooking at his expression, Helios somehow seemed to have more to say.I poked at it.\u201cYour Highness, you must have something to say.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that you, the duchess, read my mind strangely well.\u201dHe replied with a false smile.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll tell you the truth. I want you to come back to the capital, not for the time being.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus frowned, but for now he was silent.\u201cI\u2019m at my limit on my own. It used to be a burden when you were out of state for months to relax, but now the gap is bigger than that.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dHelios said to me this time.\u201cDuchess, I think you\u2019d prefer Attica to this capital. But this country really needs Kael.\u201dThen, Kaelus opened his mouth with a voice dripping with cold air ahead of me.\u201cDon\u2019t force my wife to answer, Heli.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m not forcing you, I\u2019m begging you.\u201dHelios also responded without losing.I sipped my coffee calmly.\u201c\u2026To be honest, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cHess, you don\u2019t have to.\u201dMy favorite\u2019s words gave me a gentle smile.\u201cNo, I\u2019m telling you. The most important thing to me is that you don\u2019t owe me anything. We\u2019ve had enough of our honeymoon, so we\u2019ll have to get back to where we belong.\u201dHelios grinned at the right time.\u201cThank you, Hestia.\u201dBut Kaelus had no intention of going that far.\u201cNo, there\u2019s something we need to talk about before we can stay in this capital.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s Diana doing these days?\u201dAt his sharp question, Helios and I were momentarily quiet.Kaelus\u2019 eyes cooled even more.\u201cI went to Attica with Hestia because I wanted to keep Hestia out of your problems with Diana.\u201dHelios spoke in an awkward voice.\u201cIf it\u2019s Diana\u2026.\u201dA bitter smile.\u201cWe\u2019ve been married for more than three years. We got married a day earlier than your wife.\u201dKaelus and I waited in silence for his words.\u201cWe\u2019re regaining our relationship little by little. Now we can have breakfast together. I\u2019ve been accompanied by Diana as my partner in public.\u201dIt is natural for couples, but it was certainly a great development when I recall that the relationship was the worst.\u201cDiana is much softer than before. Among the ladies of the Lily Palace, there are much more aristocrats. Of course it won\u2019t be enough in the eyes of the duchess, but I want you to know that she\u2019s still trying.\u201d\u201cDid she stop criticizing my wife?\u201dWhen Kaelus asked stiffly, Helios affirmed.\u201cShe\u2019s officially silent. Not only for Hestia, but also for the nobles.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit too bad.\u201dHelios chuckled at my words.\u201cThe duchess certainly has more leeway. I didn\u2019t expect you to say such a generous thing.\u201dI gently held Kaelus\u2019 hand.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me. I\u2019m really fine.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026\u201dPurple eyes still full of worries.I smiled silently.\u201cI\u2019ve already monopolized you enough. It\u2019s time to send it back to the people of the empire.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cIn addition, his majesty will be alive longer. In the meantime, shouldn\u2019t we stay in the capital as his majesty said? But who knows how many years it will be?\u201dHelios smiled quietly at my words.\u201cYes, Hestia.\u201dAfter many sighs and agonizing, Kaelus said yes with difficulty.\u201c\u2026Okay. I\u2019ll go back to state affairs.\u201d\u201cThank you, Kael.\u201d\u201cThanks to his majesty\u2019s request and my wife\u2019s persuasion.\u201dDespite my feisty favorite\u2019s words, Helios replied with a bright look.\u201cOf course. I won\u2019t forget.\u201d~~~~On the day he decided to stay on the capital altogether, Kaelus contacted the remaining people in Attica. He was told to meticulously take care of his household and return to the emperor.I wrote a separate letter to Madam Harmonia. I asked her to report on the situation of the territory in the future because the circumstances of the imperial city were not favorable.There was another thing to do. Having returned to the capital, I should have had a welcoming ceremony in society.I called the butler and the lady-in-waiting to discuss it.\u201cI should have a tea party at the duchy.\u201d\u201cFeel free to tell us. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can.\u201dAs expected, trustworthy people. This is why I can work courageously even if I am clumsy.It\u2019s a social event that I\u2019m in a hurry to prepare, but I\u2019ve also made some progress with my own experience.First of all, I sent invitations to several people I had frequently interacted with, including Countess Erinnis. And they quickly airlifted the top-of-the-line teas even if they gave them more money. Of course, I asked the tailor, Tekima, for the costume.Less than a week after that, I was able to throw a perfectly prepared tea party.Kaelus was there for the first time in a long time. I spoke humbly before the guests.\u201cThe smperor is in critical condition, so I avoided the splendor a little. It\u2019s a simple party, but please be generous.\u201dErinnis was all smiles.\u201cEven parties are very cautious these days. We fully understand if the duchess is not so modest.\u201dThe atmosphere continued to flow amicably. Above all, with Kaelus together, people could not help but get excited about the rare sight.\u201cYou two look really good. Attica is also Attica, but I can clearly feel that you two are happy.\u201dI agreed with someone.\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing I came here after cooling my head off in the territory.\u201dWithout Kaelus, the topic of conversation about Diana would certainly have come out here. However, even though they are in front of him, who explicitly opposed the abdication of the crown princess, no one can bring it up.In fact, I already know that there was a lot of talk in society about why we left the imperial city. So to speak, speculation that Kaelus dragged me out of the capital to protect his first love, Diana.Therefore, if we show ourselves together like this today, we will be able to completely calm down the speculation in the world.I smiled satisfactorily and put a piece of cake in my mouth.By the way.\u201c\u2026?\u201dUgh. What kind of cake is so disgusting?Kaelus, who saw my face distorted, asked quickly.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hess?\u201dI made a mistake there. There is a fear that the duchy\u2019s cook may be falsely accused. I have to be more careful because I know he\u2019s a faithful person.\u201cI think I have a slight upset stomach. I feel a little sick.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dBut one of the guests threw it out of the blue.\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d\u201c?!\u201d\u201c!\u201dWhen I heard that, Kaelus and I were frozen.\u201cDidn\u2019t the doctor say something different?\u201d asked Erinnis, forcing herself to hold back her laughter.\u201cOh\u2026 I haven\u2019t been able to see a doctor for the last few days because I\u2019ve been busy\u2026\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, it\u2019s a little past the time to get my period. I thought it was because of the lack of stamina on the way from Attica to the capital!Erinnis couldn\u2019t take it anymore and laughed aloud.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be doing this, Duchess! Well, we\u2019re going to leave quickly, so go see a doctor. Hohohoho.\u201dIn the end, that\u2019s how the party ended.The duchy\u2019s doctor was called in like a thunderbolt. I was examined by a doctor, with Kaelus watching with hawk eyes.\u201cAre you really pregnant?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dThe doctor grinned.\u201cIt\u2019s weak, but it\u2019s the pulse of a pregnant woman. Congratulations, ma\u2019am, my lord.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dOh, my God. Really?I burst into tears without realizing it. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m finally having a baby in just over two years since I became a real couple with my favorite!Once it exploded like that, it was hard to stop. I was hugged by Kaelus and wept.\u201cOh, my God! The baby is really\u2026!\u201dAs much as I waited anxiously, I couldn\u2019t express my emotion in words.Kaelus hugged me tightly and kissed me.\u201cCongratulations, Hess, and thank you.\u201dHis voice, too, was teary.\u201cI\u2019m most glad my child was born through you. Children are precious, but you\u2019re the one I love the most.\u201d\u201cThank you, Kael.\u2026.\u201dIsn\u2019t it a truly happy ending? The ordinary me who fell in love with my favorite finally bears the fruit of my favorite\u2019s love.I saved my abandoned favorite.And my dearest,Who saved me from being abandoned in this world.<For My Derelict Favorite> endPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/For My Derelict FavoriteCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA long-distance carriage trip was a lot harder than I imagined.Romantic moments, as described in the common rofan novels, are only a brief moment, and most of the moments are battles with tremendous shaking, motion sickness, and boredom on unpaved roads.Still, in my case, there were few disadvantages of boredom. Think about it! It\u2019s rather strange to sit next to my favorite all day in a small space and not get excited!However, I thought of something to relieve my boredom because I would be embarrassed if I kept looking into Kaelus\u2019 face. It\u2019s knitting!As soon as possible, I put the knitting tools I had received from Clarice on my lap and began to knit a scarf that could be worn around in the cold weather. To be honest, I don\u2019t know how to knit anything but a scarf.Reading while wearing glasses \u2013 despite this uncomfortable ride, is great \u2013 Kaelus looked across me.\u201cWhat should I make?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a scarf. I\u2019m just bored with my hands.\u201d\u201cWhose?\u201dIt\u2019s a question in an indifferent tone, but I can feel a subtle expectation in that tone.I replied with a grin.\u201cIf it\u2019s ruined, it\u2019s mine, if it\u2019s not ruined, it\u2019s yours.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe looks dissatisfied, but even if I die, I can\u2019t let him wear a ruined scarf around his neck. It was enough with the last kravat.Kaelus opened the window of the carriage. Cool air rushed in.\u201cThe air is definitely different because it\u2019s north.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201dKaelus nodded slowly.It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not, it\u2019s really different from the temperature. Unlike the capital, which has mild weather all year round except for a brief rainy season, the weather in northern Attica was basically \u201ccold.\u201d If the weather was a bit bad, a blizzard was sure to swirl with the storm.So people from Attica are famous for their survival within the empire. There are also many brave warriors.Seeing the window of the carriage open, the escort came close.\u201cIf we keep going at this pace, we\u2019ll be able to stay overnight in a nearby town and enter the Attica estate tomorrow, duke.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI frowned slightly at the words.It still will take another day. It\u2019s really far. We\u2019ve been in a carriage for five days already.Kaelus smiled quietly, as if he saw my expression.\u201cThe hard journey will soon be over. Hang in there a little longer, Hess.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dIn fact, it doesn\u2019t take this long to run fast on a horse. However, due to the long-term departure from the imperial city, there was a lot of luggage and many people to take, so I was intentionally moving around with a loose schedule.In front and back of the duchy carriage, where I and Kaelus were riding, there was a carriage with the servants, including Clarice. Including the men escorting the carriage, the party bound for Attica was by no means small.In proportion to the temperature of the cooling air, the scenery outside also became quite monotonous. Instead of colorful flowers and trees, elongated conifers increased in number.\u201cAttica is barren and doesn\u2019t feed itself well. Therefore, trade with other territories and mercenary businesses are very important.\u201d\u201cDuke Orcus was only interested in the mercenary business. Because of that, the people\u2019s livelihood was very difficult.\u201d\u201cI can see right away what I have to do. We need to solve the food problem first.\u201dKaelus smiled softly.\u201cYou\u2019ll be a really great lady.\u201d\u201cHa ha, thank you. Kael.\u201d~~~~We stayed one night in the last village and set off leisurely. All of the party looked excited as we were about to enter Attica.I opened the carriage window in anticipation. It was not long ago that snow fell, and the snow that did not melt was piled up white on the side of the road.Suddenly the carriage stopped.\u201c?\u201dWhile I was wondering, Kaelus asked the escort.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cA group of horses are coming close. The officials of the estate seem to have come to meet the lady.\u201dSoon, people wearing thick fur coats came to the carriage and stopped. Kaelus and I stepped out of the carriage.\u201cGreetings to Duchess Hestia!\u201dA group of people bent at once with a disciplined movement.I glanced at Caelus in bewilderment, it felt as if I had become the boss of an organization, and he nodded quietly.It\u2019s a little scary, but I plucked up my courage.\u201cThank you for coming all the way to meet me. This is my husband, Kaelus.\u201d\u201cGreetings to Duke Kaelus!\u201dSomething very simple but powerful. Is this the way the North is?Kaelus responded with a short, dry response as usual.\u201cNice to meet you.\u201dOne of them lifted a large load from the horse.\u201cYou won\u2019t last long in that outfit. You have to wear this coat in the North.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u201cIt was a fur coat similar to the one worn by the people of that organization. I handed one to Kaelus, and I put one on. It\u2019s definitely warm.Come to think of it, what did Madame Harmonia do in front of such big men? When I meet her later, I\u2019ll have to comfort her for her hard work..\u201cWe\u2019ll lead the way, my lady.\u201d\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll catch up.\u201dI ordered each carriage to follow in the footsteps of the estate officials. Behind a group of horses, a long procession soon followed.The coat was as heavy as its thickness. My shoulders drooped automatically.\u201c\u2026we\u2019ll get used to it in the future, right?\u201d\u201cIf you wear it often, you\u2019ll get used to it soon. Maybe we should take a walk together more often.\u201dKaelus replied with a grin.We finally stepped on the boundaries of the Attica estate. The surroundings were still desolate, but nomadic people stood out in a vast area.\u201cWow\u2026.\u201dThe first thought that came to mind. How the hell do they farm in this land? It is time to put back my ambition to solve the food problem.Kaelus seems to be a similar sentiment.\u201cThere won\u2019t be many crops left to survive.\u201d\u201cI think I touched something tough, right?\u201dMumbling in a slightly jaded tone, he encouraged me gently.\u201cYou\u2019ll do a good job. I will do my best to help you.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 Thank you\u2026\u201dAfter running for a long time, I finally saw the village.A member of the coat gang came up to the car window and said,\u201cThis is the town where the permanent residence is located.\u201d\u201cOh, really?\u201dUnlike the empty surroundings, the more the village approached, the more developed the street appeared. A landscape almost like a small city.There were strong buildings along the road that could prevent snowstorms. Many people tied dogs to carts instead of horses. They all have thick fur coats and hats in common.\u201cIf you go to the mountains, you never know when a snowstorm will hit you.\u201dOne of the guides explained.The young people of Attica stopped and looked at our party as the carriage procession passed.Expectations for a new lady who will help them expand their lives. Even the trust that we will protect their safe and cozy home. This was the impression reflected in their eyes.I finally arrived at the permanent building. It was my house where Kaelus and I will stay.There was a welcome face in front of the gate. It was Madam Harmonia in a fur coat.\u201cI see the great duchess of the empire.\u201dI couldn\u2019t stop laughing at her, who was thoroughly polite even though I hadn\u2019t seen her in a long time.\u201cMadam Harmonia is still the same. How have you been?\u201d\u201cHaha, thanks to the duchess, I\u2019m enjoying my days without any inconvenience.\u201dUnder the direction of the maid Clarice, the servants began to diligently unpack.In a rather cluttered state, Harmonia guided us to the permanent residence. Kaelus gently held my hand and looked around the new house.\u201cBefore the duke and the duchess arrived, we renovated the mansion in general. You won\u2019t feel like it\u2019s been empty for a long time.\u201dI asked carefully what I was worried about.\u201cDon\u2019t the people of Attica resent Kaelys?\u201dMy concern was quite natural, as it was my favorite who handed over a poison tea to Duke Orcus, the former lord of this estate.But Harmonia shook her head still.\u201cFortunately, the former lord is not a man of high reputation, so the people of the land expect more from the new lady. If the duchess does the same thing as taking care of Illion\u2019s affairs, the people here may praise you as a saint.\u201d\u201cHa ha ha\u2026 do as much as Ilion\u2026.\u201dDamn it. It\u2019s not gonna be easy.The permanent residence was much larger than the duchy of the capital in terms of the size of the mansion. There are two separate houses, and the backyard is so wide that it was rather a forest.Is this the scale of the North? Kaelus looked surprised, too.\u201cIt\u2019s very wide.\u201d\u201cYes, duke. Foreigners who visit Attica usually stay for a few days or months, so they built many rooms like this. I usually use the detached house for that purpose.\u201dWell, there\u2019s no way I\u2019ll be the only one with visitors. There will be attendants, escorts, and even horses in carriage.I mourned quietly in my heart. It is clear that the employees who followed the duke will suffer from managing the mansion in the future.And I thanked Harmonia, who came first and laid the groundwork before we arrived.\u201cThanks to Madam, I entered Attica without a hitch. You\u2019ve done a great job.\u201d\u201cHo-ho, the residents are tough, but they\u2019re honest. I\u2019m sure the duke and the duchess will love this place.\u201dShe was sure with a clear expression.I answered, too, facing Kaelus.\u201cYes, I think so.\u201dIt\u2019s better to be able to hold hands like this all the time under the pretext of being cold.This is how Attica\u2019s first day went.~~~~Life in Attica began in earnest.First of all, I tried to fix up Attica\u2019s tattered internal affairs one by one, taking advantage of the experience built up by the Illion internal affairs.Madam Harmonia was in charge of communicating their needs to me by meeting with the estate officials and residents in person. Thanks to her exceptional talent for building relationships, I was able to communicate with the commoners without having to meet them in person.The operation of a private clinic and a medical training center in imperial city was led by the duchy\u2019s doctor as the \u201cdirector.\u201d He was so enthusiastic that I had little to worry about.Kaelus also took a room in the permanent residence as his office and completely took over Illion\u2019s internal affairs. Illion officials were uncomfortable traveling long distances, but the cold lord, Kaelus, did not mind.I got used to the cold weather. In addition to the coats presented by the guide, the thick fur clothes worn by Kaelus and I increased one by one.I often exchanged letters with the capital. I sent news and greetings to butler Uross and Countess Erinnis. Kaelus mainly contacted the emperor and Helios. It was because his opinion was needed in the management of state affairs.But it wasn\u2019t really this job that accounted for most of Attica daily life.\u201cKael, wasn\u2019t it cold last night?\u201d\u201cWell, not at all.\u201dEven under the covers, this naked man really doesn\u2019t look cold at all.His arm was tightly wrapped around my waist.\u201cIt\u2019s very warm thanks to your temperature.\u201d\u201cHa ha\u2026\u201dNo lies, except for the time each of us spent three or four hours doing public affairs, we were together every minute and every second without falling apart.Kaelus naturally learned more about me.\u201cWhy do you like soup so much?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you feel better when you eat something hot on a cold day?\u201d\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true, but you\u2019re the only one who dips rice in it and eats it.\u201dSeems like you don\u2019t know. Rice soup is absolutely the best in this cold weather.Kaelus suddenly looked sorry.\u201cYou didn\u2019t eat this much in the capital.\u201d\u201cOh, the imperial city wasn\u2019t cold enough to crave this food. I didn\u2019t really think of it.\u201dI chuckled.\u201cBut I never knew you were so good with swords. Why didn\u2019t you show me swordplay once?\u201dIn the original novel, there was at least one scene where Helios and Kaelus faced swords and engaged in a war of nerves over Diana, but in reality, it was more than I imagined. He\u2019s not just mimicking, he\u2019s really good at swinging his sword.Kaelus replied awkwardly.\u201cI\u2019m just practicing for my stamina. But come to think of it, I haven\u2019t really used a sword since I married you.\u201dTouching his chin, Kaelus pondered.\u201cI\u2019ve been busy with my work for months since I returned to politics\u2026 When I was with Heli, I spent most of my time fighting. Is that why?\u201d\u201c?\u201dSuddenly he smiled at me.\u201cI think my lifestyle has changed a little because I\u2019m away from Heli and I\u2019m stuck with you. But if you want, I\u2019ll show you the sword often.\u201d\u201cOh, good!\u201dHer favorite body type is definitely slimmer than Helios. Unlike Helios, where you could tell that his muscles have developed even when he was wearing clothes, her favorite\u2019s figure is slimmer at first glance.Of course, the story of Kaelus was completely different when he took off his clothes.\u201cAnd you have to see a doctor after eating. Hestia.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dSuddenly, the stern tone of Kaelus made me look sad.\u201cIt will be our second wedding anniversary soon. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve\u2026.\u201dKaelus briefly muddled his words. You\u2019re probably thinking about my return.\u201c\u2026I remember you collapsed in the temple at this time, so don\u2019t let your guard down even if you\u2019re healthy now.\u201d\u201cWell, but it\u2019s really fine. At this rate, I won\u2019t get sick.\u201dI deliberately retorted back to reassure him.But he shook his head.\u201cI can\u2019t relax until I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be safe.\u201dIt\u2019s a little annoying, but what can\u2019t I do if he feels uncomfortable?\u201cOkay, I\u2019ll see a doctor after I eat, so you can join me.\u201dKaelus replied with a heavy nod.After a while, we sat face to face with the doctor.\u201cThe duchess is as healthy as she was yesterday, duke.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dKaelus, who is relieved only for one day after hearing the expert\u2019s opinion. But tomorrow, we have to hear what tomorrow says.Actually, my concern is separate.\u201cDixie, is there a case where pregnancy is not going well despite being this healthy?\u201d\u201cYes, it\u2019s more common than you think. Duchess, don\u2019t worry too much, just relax.\u201d\u201cUm\u2026\u201dI don\u2019t think it\u2019s because Kaelus and I aren\u2019t working hard enough. Rather, we do it almost every night.But if my anxiety about pregnancy stems purely from my desire to have children, Kaelus\u2019s anxiety is a little different.Worried that I would die like before the regression, he worried that even this phenomenon was a sign of my death.A frosty voice headed to the innocent doctor.\u201cIf anything is wrong with my wife, don\u2019t hesitate to tell her.\u201d\u201cYes, yes\u2026!\u201dAfter leaving the doctor, I walked through the woods behind the mansion, holding Kaelus\u2019 hand.\u201cI\u2019ll be fine, Kael.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I have a very strong feeling that everything will be fine.\u201dI\u2019m not lying. Seriously, these days, I wonder if this is the real reason why I\u2019ve been possessed and returned.The reason I thought was the salvation of Kaelus.It seems that the author of the original novel is not the same as the god of the world. What power does the rofan author have to make me, a reader, immerse myself in his work and even return in it?Then it means that there\u2019s a separate subject called \u201cGod\u201d.But more important to me than who the god is, why should I continue to live in this world?Why am I living in this world. Why does God keep me here.There was no clear answer anywhere. Still, it was possible to find answers metaphorically through life here.It\u2019s Kaelus. There was no reason for me to live in this world except for Kaelus.If God had sent me here for my abandoned favorite, there would be no reason to let me leave here suddenly without doing it for him.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Kael. I\u2019ll be fine as long as you\u2019re alive.\u201dHe asked me back with a not-so-bright face, as I said with a smile.\u201cHow do you know that?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s just how it feels.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dNo matter what I say, he will never be relieved. Before regression, until I safely passed the point of my death.~~~~Months passed like the wind. Finally, we celebrated our second wedding anniversary.However, it was not just a day to celebrate the second year of marriage. It was a day when I was happy to survive in this world safely, changing the future before my return.In front of the table, which is not as fancy as the capital, we drank a toast.\u201cI\u2019m glad we\u2019ve been married for two years, but most of all, I\u2019m grateful that you survived safely.\u201dKaelus said in an emotionally trembling voice.I also responded with a smile.\u201cWhat did I tell you? I told you everything would be fine.\u201dHe tilted his head.\u201cBut I\u2019m really curious. How could you be so sure?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s a special feeling for the regressor\u2026?\u201dPerhaps the answer was not as great as expected, Kaelus grimaced.I made up for it with a smile.\u201cHa ha, I don\u2019t know exactly. But I think you\u2019re the reason I had to go back.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m the reason?\u201dPretty purple eyes glistened with water again.I smiled brightly.\u201cI never expected a return. But just before I died, and after I returned, the first thing that came to my mind was none other than you.\u201dThe beginning and end of this life as Hestia has always been Kaelus. Even when I close my eyes.And even at the moment I opened my eyes.Even every breath I take, I always think of Kaelus.It\u2019s impossible for me to pursue my own life apart from him.Are my words uncomfortable? Does it feel foolish to live only for others and not for myself?But that\u2019s not true. I am extremely happy, and it is unbearably painful to pursue a life of my own withoutKaelus.\u201cEveryone must have a purpose to be born in this land. Maybe it\u2019s you for me.\u201dIt\u2019s not \u2018maybe\u2019, it\u2019s actually an immovable conviction.But Kaelus confesses the same as I do.\u201cYou\u2019re the one who saved me from dying. I got the rest of my life entirely thanks to you.\u201dHis lips touched me still.\u201cYou\u2019re the owner of the rest of my life. So please be with me forever.\u201dI gently hugged his neck with my arms.\u201cNo matter where you go or what you do, I will never leave you.\u201dI\u2019m a little scared and nervous about living a new life that I\u2019ve never repeated.However, I am not lonely because I have a companion walking with me.What kind of adventure will we have tomorrow?My heart just swells with anticipation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It goes without saying how excellent the choice was.One day, about a year after our second wedding anniversary.It was nice to see the warm weather. I took a walk around the neighborhood with Kaelus.\u201cThe potato crop has increased, so everyone likes it.\u201d\u201cIt went well to trade Attica\u2019s forest products for Illion\u2019s crops. Both territories were satisfied.\u201dWhen I returned home talking with him, I received an urgent call from imperial city.\u201cWho is it?\u201d\u201cHmm. Heli sent it.\u201dReading the letter, Kaelus\u2019 face darkened.\u201cThe emperor\u2019s condition is not very good.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dHe was like a father to him. He often referred to Kaelus as his 'second son\u201d in public.I clasped his hand.\u201cLet\u2019s go to imperial city. You could really regret it if you hesitate.\u201d\u201cYeah, I should.\u201dThe road prepared us for a hasty departure to the capital. I had to move quickly, so I packed my clothes with the least amount of luggage and personnel.~~~~It\u2019s been a long time since we left the land of snow and ice and headed south. At the time of coming to Attica, the road, which took almost a week, was shortened to three days this time.At last we reached the duchy of the capital. However, far from relieving the fatigue, Kaelus and I rushed to the palace without having time to greet the servants who had kept the house.There were already a considerable number of aristocrats gathered in the Lion Palace. When we appeared, there were sighs and buzzes here and there.Countess Erinnis greeted me with a handkerchief wiping tears.\u201cDuchess Hestia! Duke Kaelus!\u201d\u201cAh, Countess\u2026!\u201dIt was not a situation to greet peacefully, so I briefly asked about the state of the emperor.\u201cWhat happened to his majesty?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s been debilitating, but his condition has suddenly deteriorated over the past few days. The courtiers are all stuck, but he really needs to prepare himself this time.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dKaelus\u2019 face turned almost earthy.\u201cI must go to see his majesty right away, Hess.\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m coming with you.\u201dWe hurried to the emperor\u2019s bedroom. I reached the bedroom door, past a corridor heavily guarded by guards.\u201cTell him Kaelus, the lord of Illion, and Hestia, the lady of Attica, to see him.\u201dThe chief bowed deeply, and after being polite, he hurried inside.\u201cCome on in.\u201dKaelus exchanged glances with me for a moment, and then stepped carefully so that there was no sound of footsteps.I could see the bed in which the emperor was lying.\u201c\u2026.\u201dThe white-faced Diana looked at us and rose silently. an expression on the verge of tears The sea-colored eyes were already filled with tears.Kaelus approached the emperor without giving her an eye.\u201cYour Majesty!\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201dPerhaps he had just come to his senses in his voice, the emperor confirmed him with his dim eyes.\u201cAh\u2026 Kaelus\u2026.\u201dA weak hand shook on the quilt. Kaelus managed to notice it and clasped his hand tightly.I think we need to move out for the two of them now.\u201c\u2026\u201dBut that tactless Diana is always the problem. She was standing next to the bed as if he were stuck with a handkerchief and only shedding tears.It can\u2019t be helped. It\u2019s been a while since we saw each other, but you and I must be destined to bump into each other every time we see.I boldly talked to him.\u201cYour highness the crown princess. Why don\u2019t we go out for a while?\u201d\u201c?\u201dHer fine eyebrows were slightly distorted. But when I looked at her with force in my eyes, she nodded gently.I kissed Kaelus lightly.\u201cKael, see you later\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHe nodded in silence.~~~~Coming out, Diana and I looked away in silence from each other.Judging from her attitude, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s properly reflecting on herself yet as Helios said.Do you still need more time? It\u2019s hard to change a person in a few years.Still, let\u2019s take a peek to see how much she has taken steps to reflect on herself.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I saw you, your grace.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. Long time no see.\u201dIt\u2019s cold. This is the end of the progress check.I should have pushed her to abdication, but Kaelus broke down. For a moment, old resentment rises.\u201c\u2026.\u201dBut while I was spending time with Kaelus and Attica, I changed my mind a lot.He was absolutely right. It was much more important to think only about what we would make us happy among ourselves, regardless of what others did. It\u2019s actually overwhelming to just care about that.So I decided not to take Diana\u2019s reaction to heart.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dShe made a sudden noise next to me, and I turned my head in surprise.Helios was approaching at a rapid pace, perhaps hearing our news.\u201cThe great sun of the empire\u2026\u201d\u201cHestia. Is Kaelus inside?\u201dThe habit of cutting off the cumbersome etiquette is still there. I answered quickly.\u201cYes, his majesty has left his seat for a quiet conversation with my husband.\u201d\u201cI see. Whoo\u2026\u201dHelios sighed with great relief.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d\u201cHmm? Ah, I\u2026\u2026 I was glad you guys came before it was too late.\u201dI honestly don\u2019t know what to say to Helios, who smiles bitterly. What should I say to the person who has his dying father in front of him?It is a pity that life experience is far short at times like this.In the end, after thinking and thinking, I barely gave him this word.\u201cHis Majesty will wake up.\u201dAlthough the expression is corny, I hope my apologetic heart can be conveyed.Fortunately, Helios took my consolation.\u201cI hope so, too. Thank you, Hestia.\u201dThen the door opened and the palace chief appeared. Helios and Diana, who were standing in front of him, turned their heads in surprise.\u201cYour highness the crown prince. His majesty is calling.\u201d\u201cI got it.\u201dWhen he went inside, Diana and I were left alone in the hallway again.\u201c\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dThe awkwardness that came again. I just have to think of Diana as a person who doesn\u2019t exist.I don\u2019t have the heart to make up with her. Of course, I didn\u2019t just do nice things when I confronted her. But just as she doesn\u2019t want to apologize, I don\u2019t really reflect on my actions either.Yes, I can\u2019t force Diana to reflect on herself when I don\u2019t reflect on myself.It\u2019s just that until she realizes what\u2019s wrong with her, Kaelus and I have to live with our own happiness.To be honest, it takes energy to hate constantly.When I spent a long time alone in various thoughts.As the tightly closed door opened, Kaelus and Helios reappeared.I quickly approached my favorite.\u201cKael.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026\u201dKaelus looked very tired.Then Helios said to us, \u201cI\u2019ll call the two of you soon. Until then, stay in imperial city for now.\u201d\u201cYes, your highness.\u201dI answered on behalf of Kael.Helios turned his back and disappeared down the hall.\u201c\u2026\u201dDiana looked at us for a moment, and then silently returned to the emperor.I held the cold hands of Kaelus.\u201cWe\u2019re going back, too.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes.\u201dHe took my hand and walked weakly.~~~~After a long time, we laid together on the bed of the duke\u2019s mansion.Kaelus opened his mouth with a heavy face.\u201cHis majesty\u2026\u201dWhen Kaelus blurted the end of his words, I waited silently for the words to follow.\u201c\u2026 He wanted me to remain in the capital.\u201d\u201c!\u201dOnly then did I realize why he had such a dark look on his face.You must have feared that I would be troubled by confrontation with Diana in the noisy capital. In particular, I think I caused a suicide disturbance in front of my favorite. Maybe he\u2019s afraid of life in the capital.However, to turn a blind eye to this and go back to Attica to make us happy, I am concerned about the emperor\u2019s request, which is like a will.I asked cautiously.\u201cWhat do you want me to do?\u201d\u201cI\u2026.\u201dHe shook his head as if he didn\u2019t know.Nevertheless, I can clearly feel his heart shaking. Can I help you with your decision?\u201cKael, I promised I\u2019d follow you wherever you went. Whether it\u2019s Attica or the capital, now I\u2019m happy wherever I am with you.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t know what to do, stay in the capital for the rest of your life. We can think about what to do later.\u201dIn fact, I still don\u2019t care much about anyone other than Kaelus. Whatever happens to the emperor or not, it\u2019s enough as long as I\u2019m happy with my favorite.But I don\u2019t want to burden him in return for my happiness.Moreover, the emperor does not have much time left. To ease Kaelus\u2019s mind, that much is willing to yield.\u201cLet\u2019s do that, Kael.\u201dI urged him once again.After a long sigh, Kaelus nodded slowly.\u201cThank you, Hestia. If you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll probably stay in the capital a little longer. I\u2019m very sorry to just reject his majesty\u2019s words.\u201d\u201cYes, I feel the same way.\u201dThis extended our capital schedule a little bit.The next day, Helios brought Kaelus and I to the palace.\u201cYou must have been very surprised to hear the news out of the blue. But thank you for coming quickly.\u201dHe poured tea in front of Kaelus and coffee in front of me.Raising the teacup, Kaelus asked.\u201cIs there a reason why his majesty got worse so quickly?\u201d\u201cAccording to the court doctor, a person who has been bedridden for a long time can be affected by a very minor cause in an instant.\u201dHelios replied with a complex look.The emperor was less than fifty years old, even for his parents\u2019 generation. However, due to his long illness, he looked much older on the outside.In this world where modern medicine is not developed, the average life expectancy is extremely short, around the age of three to forty. Perhaps that\u2019s why people think the emperor is enduring for a sick person.Kaelus spoke slowly.\u201cYesterday, his Majesty asked me to remain in the capital.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dHelios shook his head in silence.\u201cSo I discussed it with Hess yesterday, and I decided to stay in the imperial city for a while.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201dLooking at his expression, Helios somehow seemed to have more to say.I poked at it.\u201cYour Highness, you must have something to say.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is that you, the duchess, read my mind strangely well.\u201dHe replied with a false smile.\u201c\u2026I\u2019ll tell you the truth. I want you to come back to the capital, not for the time being.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201dKaelus frowned, but for now he was silent.\u201cI\u2019m at my limit on my own. It used to be a burden when you were out of state for months to relax, but now the gap is bigger than that.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026.\u201dHelios said to me this time.\u201cDuchess, I think you\u2019d prefer Attica to this capital. But this country really needs Kael.\u201dThen, Kaelus opened his mouth with a voice dripping with cold air ahead of me.\u201cDon\u2019t force my wife to answer, Heli.\u201d\u201cOh, I\u2019m not forcing you, I\u2019m begging you.\u201dHelios also responded without losing.I sipped my coffee calmly.\u201c\u2026To be honest, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cHess, you don\u2019t have to.\u201dMy favorite\u2019s words gave me a gentle smile.\u201cNo, I\u2019m telling you. The most important thing to me is that you don\u2019t owe me anything. We\u2019ve had enough of our honeymoon, so we\u2019ll have to get back to where we belong.\u201dHelios grinned at the right time.\u201cThank you, Hestia.\u201dBut Kaelus had no intention of going that far.\u201cNo, there\u2019s something we need to talk about before we can stay in this capital.\u201d\u201c?\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s Diana doing these days?\u201dAt his sharp question, Helios and I were momentarily quiet.Kaelus\u2019 eyes cooled even more.\u201cI went to Attica with Hestia because I wanted to keep Hestia out of your problems with Diana.\u201dHelios spoke in an awkward voice.\u201cIf it\u2019s Diana\u2026.\u201dA bitter smile.\u201cWe\u2019ve been married for more than three years. We got married a day earlier than your wife.\u201dKaelus and I waited in silence for his words.\u201cWe\u2019re regaining our relationship little by little. Now we can have breakfast together. I\u2019ve been accompanied by Diana as my partner in public.\u201dIt is natural for couples, but it was certainly a great development when I recall that the relationship was the worst.\u201cDiana is much softer than before. Among the ladies of the Lily Palace, there are much more aristocrats. Of course it won\u2019t be enough in the eyes of the duchess, but I want you to know that she\u2019s still trying.\u201d\u201cDid she stop criticizing my wife?\u201dWhen Kaelus asked stiffly, Helios affirmed.\u201cShe\u2019s officially silent. Not only for Hestia, but also for the nobles.\u201d\u201cWell, that\u2019s a bit too bad.\u201dHelios chuckled at my words.\u201cThe duchess certainly has more leeway. I didn\u2019t expect you to say such a generous thing.\u201dI gently held Kaelus\u2019 hand.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry about me. I\u2019m really fine.\u201d\u201cHess\u2026\u201dPurple eyes still full of worries.I smiled silently.\u201cI\u2019ve already monopolized you enough. It\u2019s time to send it back to the people of the empire.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201d\u201cIn addition, his majesty will be alive longer. In the meantime, shouldn\u2019t we stay in the capital as his majesty said? But who knows how many years it will be?\u201dHelios smiled quietly at my words.\u201cYes, Hestia.\u201dAfter many sighs and agonizing, Kaelus said yes with difficulty.\u201c\u2026Okay. I\u2019ll go back to state affairs.\u201d\u201cThank you, Kael.\u201d\u201cThanks to his majesty\u2019s request and my wife\u2019s persuasion.\u201dDespite my feisty favorite\u2019s words, Helios replied with a bright look.\u201cOf course. I won\u2019t forget.\u201d~~~~On the day he decided to stay on the capital altogether, Kaelus contacted the remaining people in Attica. He was told to meticulously take care of his household and return to the emperor.I wrote a separate letter to Madam Harmonia. I asked her to report on the situation of the territory in the future because the circumstances of the imperial city were not favorable.There was another thing to do. Having returned to the capital, I should have had a welcoming ceremony in society.I called the butler and the lady-in-waiting to discuss it.\u201cI should have a tea party at the duchy.\u201d\u201cFeel free to tell us. We\u2019ll help you as much as we can.\u201dAs expected, trustworthy people. This is why I can work courageously even if I am clumsy.It\u2019s a social event that I\u2019m in a hurry to prepare, but I\u2019ve also made some progress with my own experience.First of all, I sent invitations to several people I had frequently interacted with, including Countess Erinnis. And they quickly airlifted the top-of-the-line teas even if they gave them more money. Of course, I asked the tailor, Tekima, for the costume.Less than a week after that, I was able to throw a perfectly prepared tea party.Kaelus was there for the first time in a long time. I spoke humbly before the guests.\u201cThe smperor is in critical condition, so I avoided the splendor a little. It\u2019s a simple party, but please be generous.\u201dErinnis was all smiles.\u201cEven parties are very cautious these days. We fully understand if the duchess is not so modest.\u201dThe atmosphere continued to flow amicably. Above all, with Kaelus together, people could not help but get excited about the rare sight.\u201cYou two look really good. Attica is also Attica, but I can clearly feel that you two are happy.\u201dI agreed with someone.\u201cI think it\u2019s a good thing I came here after cooling my head off in the territory.\u201dWithout Kaelus, the topic of conversation about Diana would certainly have come out here. However, even though they are in front of him, who explicitly opposed the abdication of the crown princess, no one can bring it up.In fact, I already know that there was a lot of talk in society about why we left the imperial city. So to speak, speculation that Kaelus dragged me out of the capital to protect his first love, Diana.Therefore, if we show ourselves together like this today, we will be able to completely calm down the speculation in the world.I smiled satisfactorily and put a piece of cake in my mouth.By the way.\u201c\u2026?\u201dUgh. What kind of cake is so disgusting?Kaelus, who saw my face distorted, asked quickly.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, Hess?\u201dI made a mistake there. There is a fear that the duchy\u2019s cook may be falsely accused. I have to be more careful because I know he\u2019s a faithful person.\u201cI think I have a slight upset stomach. I feel a little sick.\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dBut one of the guests threw it out of the blue.\u201cAre you pregnant?\u201d\u201c?!\u201d\u201c!\u201dWhen I heard that, Kaelus and I were frozen.\u201cDidn\u2019t the doctor say something different?\u201d asked Erinnis, forcing herself to hold back her laughter.\u201cOh\u2026 I haven\u2019t been able to see a doctor for the last few days because I\u2019ve been busy\u2026\u2026\u201dCome to think of it, it\u2019s a little past the time to get my period. I thought it was because of the lack of stamina on the way from Attica to the capital!Erinnis couldn\u2019t take it anymore and laughed aloud.\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be doing this, Duchess! Well, we\u2019re going to leave quickly, so go see a doctor. Hohohoho.\u201dIn the end, that\u2019s how the party ended.The duchy\u2019s doctor was called in like a thunderbolt. I was examined by a doctor, with Kaelus watching with hawk eyes.\u201cAre you really pregnant?\u201d\u201cWell\u2026\u201dThe doctor grinned.\u201cIt\u2019s weak, but it\u2019s the pulse of a pregnant woman. Congratulations, ma\u2019am, my lord.\u201d\u201cOh\u2026\u2026!\u201d\u201cAhhhh!\u201dOh, my God. Really?I burst into tears without realizing it. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m finally having a baby in just over two years since I became a real couple with my favorite!Once it exploded like that, it was hard to stop. I was hugged by Kaelus and wept.\u201cOh, my God! The baby is really\u2026!\u201dAs much as I waited anxiously, I couldn\u2019t express my emotion in words.Kaelus hugged me tightly and kissed me.\u201cCongratulations, Hess, and thank you.\u201dHis voice, too, was teary.\u201cI\u2019m most glad my child was born through you. Children are precious, but you\u2019re the one I love the most.\u201d\u201cThank you, Kael.\u2026.\u201dIsn\u2019t it a truly happy ending? The ordinary me who fell in love with my favorite finally bears the fruit of my favorite\u2019s love.I saved my abandoned favorite.And my dearest,Who saved me from being abandoned in this world.<For My Derelict Favorite> endPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNovel InfoNovel Info",
