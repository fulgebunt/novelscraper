You don't have to come to the training center starting tomorrow.\u201cI stared vacantly at the manager before I could regain my composure.\u201c\u2026Why am I being kicked out?\u201cHan Sungyeun-nim, I think you know exactly why we're kicking you out.\u201d\u201cKeeping you here is becoming too much of a burden for our training center.\u201d\u201cI've never missed a single payment and I'm fulfilling all the prerequisites.\u201d\u201cWell, of course. Because you're preparing for the hunter exam. The problem is that it's already been 7 years since you've started preparing.\u201dThe manager narrowed his eyes and scoured my body.\u201cEven after 7 years of physical training, you weren't able to learn a single skill or unlock your innate ability. You weren't even able to raise a single stat point.\u201dHis harsh response felt like a dagger in my heart.Like he said, I had achieved nothing in the last 7 years of training.I couldn't unlock a single skill, let alone even raise a stat point.'Damn it.'And this happened in a center for professional player training.Everyone who awakens as a player must train in one of these centers for a couple of months before they are able to debut as a hunter.But\u2026'I couldn't get anything done in the years that I've been training here.'Realistically, it wasn't an exaggeration to say that I would never be able to become a hunter.I didn't have a hint of the fundamental qualifications that even the most basic hunters have.But I stayed calm and asked in a monotone voice\u2014\u201c\u2026Is that the reason I'm being kicked out?\u201d\u201cTo be a little more specific, you give us a bad name. A pretty infamous one at that.\u201dI could finally understand what the manager was trying to say.\u201cYou're worried about what people would think of a training center that couldn't get a trainee to debut after 7 years of training.\u201dThe manager stayed quiet but nodded with a smirk.Yeah, I knew this would happen one day.God damn it.\u201cLet's be honest, you're nothing special.\u201d\u201cYou have no aptitude for this. Do you think you'll ever pass the hunter exam?\u201d\u201cDo you think something will change just from working hard? That's not how things work. You're wasting your time.\u201dHis words filled with contempt pierced my soul.But I couldn't dispute his points or even throw a punch.After all, a slightly athletic average person stood no chance against a former hunter.As he said, it wasn't an exaggeration to call me completely talentless.I didn't want to repress these feelings, but I had to.Why?'Because I'm weak and I have nothing.'I'd been enduring this for so long, but it seemed as though there was no need for that anymore.Yeah, it was time to end it. I was exhausted.\u201cOf course, we're not just going to banish you without compensation. We'll refund you about 50% of the fees that you've\u2026\u201dWhy was he still talking?All he was doing was trying to convince me to leave.\u201cYeah, I got it. Just give me my 50% refund. Goodbye.\u201dAs his sentence finished, I walked past him toward the exit.I thought he wanted to say something, but he ended up not stopping me.Well, there was nothing left to say, and I wasn't the one who had something to lose by getting angry.Then\u2026\u201cWoah, he's been here since way before I was, but now he's getting kicked out like that.\u201dStarting with a comment from an onlooker, I was bombarded with stares from all over the room.\u201cBut he came in every morning to train non-stop\u2026 It's too bad, huh?\u201d\u201cFuck feeling bad. He's an idiot for not knowing his place and stopping sooner.\u201d\u201cYou think so? I guess he is pretty stupid for not giving up.\u201d\u201cI didn't know he couldn't increase a single stat point after training for 7 years.\u201dSympathy, scorn, and even ridicule\u2026I didn't know what I did so wrong to have them look down on me for all 7 years of my training.Whether I heard them or not.They always jeered at the fact that I was essentially powerless as a player.And just like that, my 7 years of training became proof of my foolishness.But\u2026\u201cI guess that's that. Damn it.\u201dI muttered to myself as I stepped out of the center and stared into the sky.7 years of non-stop training\u2026\u201cSigh\u2026\u201dIt ended in an absurdly simple way.I didn't always want to be a hunter.It happened during the Great Calamity, when my parents were eaten alive by the hoards of monsters from a dungeon break.And I wasn't alone in that experience.But even from those people, only a few select people were able to awaken as a player.Even then, I prayed to God to awaken me as a player.Is that why?\u201cI did awaken as a player. Just awakened.\u201dThe problem came afterward.No matter what I did, my stats wouldn't increase and my 'innate ability' never unlocked.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksBut I didn't lose hope and continued to train.Because skills are given to those who are ready\u2026I trained my heart out for 7 years after that.I didn't even hope to unlock my innate ability.I just wanted to be slightly more capable than an average person.My only hope was that one day, I would be able to avenge my parents.But the world didn't allow me such privilege.And here is where I ended up.I sat on a snow-covered bench in a park taking a sip from a can of beer.\u201c\u2026I guess I was stupid. 7 years\u2026\u201dNot even the others who lost their families to a dungeon break went this far.More accurately, they weren't able to.After about 2 years, most people come face-to-face with reality and give up.Either that\u2026 or they realize their potential and climb up to the top.I wasn't able to do either of those.'I didn't know nothing would change, even after 7 years\u2026.'Heh.I couldn't help but smile at such an obvious result.\u201cAt least I tried.\u201dNo, I did more than just try.Most people face reality and find a different path for themselves. But not me.I didn't know what to do with my life anymore.But after 7 years of not giving up, I wasn't going to start now.'I'm not so weak that I would consider giving up on my life.'Tap\u2026!I placed the empty beer can down on the bench and looked to the sky.To commemorate the end of an era, I decided to ramble to my parents.\u201c\u2026I tried so hard. I wanted to avenge you and kill those monsters but\u2026 It's just not going the way I want it to. I'm so sorry. I'm sorry that someone like me is your child.\u201dI felt slightly somber but not enough to cry.7 years was enough to dull my sorrow.As the years went on, the intense pain was subdued, and now I was completely numb to it.'There was a time when I had to train all through the night because the pain and sadness kept me up.'At age 27, I didn't even want to train anymore.Maybe it was obvious now that I knew I would never become a hunter.That's one of the reasons I didn't put up a fight at the training center.I'd rather end it quickly than hang on pathetically\u2026At least I was able to end it on my own terms before anyone else could force me to.After the end of my rambling, I leaned back on the bench and just stared at the drab sky.I decided to give up on being a hunter, but I couldn't help feeling a lingering attachment.'If I had even a sliver of talent\u2026 or even just an innate ability\u2026\u201dIf\u2026If I had even a glimmer of hope, I wouldn't give up.My eyes slowly closed, as did my wishful thinking.Still dazed, I see something like a holographic message in front of my eyes.\u300c The 'Tower of Trials' praises your unbreaking will. \u300dThe first thing I saw in this dream was someone's praise.'Who is this?'I had questions, but there wasn't any time to continue with that train of thought.\u300c 'Tower of Trials' has selected all suitable candidates from Earth. \u300d\u300c Please select your difficulty. \u300d\u300c The chosen difficulty will be directly proportional to your rewards. \u300dThree choices appeared in front of me at the end of the message.\u300c Easy \u300d \u300c Medium \u300d \u300c Hard \u300dI didn't find anything out of place even though I was looking at a holographic message.A strange feeling of being on a border of consciousness and unconsciousness.Rather than questioning the circumstance, I could only think to make a decision.To make a choice.A choice that I wouldn't regret if I reached my hand out.Enticed, I reached out as if there was no other choice.Then\u2026\u300c You have selected the difficulty 'Hard.' \u300d\u300c We wish the challenger a satisfactory ending to their choice. \u300dWoosh\u2026!The message blew away like a tiny candlelight, and my consciousness grew clearer.I was completely awake.\u300c Now entering Tower of Trials floor 1. \u300d\u300c Challengers should now prepare themselves for the incoming trial. \u300dI only just realized that something strange was happening, but there was nothing I could do at this point.\u300c Entering Tower of Trials floor 1. \u300dMy surroundings shifted from a park bench to a desert.\u300c The 1st-floor trial is starting now. \u300d\u300c The following trial is a special trial given as a tutorial. \u300d\u300c The objective of the following trial is 'survival.' \u300d\u300c We wish the challenger a satisfactory ending to their choice. \u300dAt this moment I knew\u2026\u300c Trial success reward \u2013 Unlocking innate ability \u300d\u300c Trial fail penalty \u2013 Death \u300d\u201c\u2026Fuck.\u201dIf my life had a turning point, this would be it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What is this?'Starting with the most basic questions about my current state of affairs.'Tower of Trials? Is this the second coming of the Great Calamity?'I even stipulated what the current situation could be about.The influx of thoughts ricocheted around my throbbing head.But even that was temporary.\u300c Providing a weapon. \u300dClack.Following the message about a weapon, a sword fell before me.One with a sharpened edge, unlike the wooden ones I used to use at the training center.The knife spanned about 30 inches.\u201cWhat is\u2026?\u201dThere's no way a single can of beer could get me this drunk.Although it's almost nonexistent, my alcohol tolerance was heightened when I awakened as a player.But\u2026'There's no way that's making me dream like this.'I quickly looked around and analyzed my surroundings.The place I was standing was no longer a bench in a winter park, but rather a random desert.No, could you even call this a desert?The place was covered in sand and an occasional row of cacti.Although it seemed normal at first glance, the boundary where the sky met the horizon said otherwise.It was vast and spacious, but clearly synthetic.If this was a dungeon, I would have needed to pass through a gate, so that isn't a possibility.As I was about to fall into a state of confusion\u2014\u300c Sand golem is appearing. \u300dKooom\u2026!\u201cWhat the\u2026\u2026!\u201dThe sandy floors quaked, and pillars of sand rose from the ground.Then the pillars started to come together to form a humanoid shape.The towering golem must have been at least 20 feet tall.My heart stopped when the golem laid its sand-dripping scarlet eyes upon me.At the same time, another holographic message appeared.\u300c Survive the sand golem. \u300d\u300c Time left \u2013 9min 59sec \u300d\u201cGrrrr\u2026\u201dA trial telling me to survive.And all the unanswered questions in my head.Everything seemed to connect as soon as I came face to face with the sand golem.I couldn't feign ignorance even if I tried.\u201cDamn it!\u201dI quickly picked up the sword from the floor and ran as fast as I could.A battle?Impossible considering our size difference.Even a graze from a sand golem is enough to kill a grown man in an instant.A low-tier player like me wouldn't fare much better.That's reality.Stomp! Stomp! Stomp!\u201cKraaaaa\u2026!\u201dEvery hair on my back stood on end as its roar vibrated through my body.I wanted to run faster but I couldn't.Stomp! Stomp!My feet got buried under a pile of sand every time I took a step forward.\u201cFuck fuck FUCK!\u201dThe desert was holding me captive.At the same time, the stomping sound was approaching faster than my legs could move.Even if I did manage to run, the only thing waiting for me was a wall that reached up to the sky.I'd either be killed by being caught up to or by reaching the end of this field.There might not even be an escape from this place.My only hope was the time limit that I could glance at from the corner of my eyes\u2014\u300c Time left \u2013 9min 12sec \u300dIt's not possible to keep running for 9 more minutes with my stamina.I may have stood a chance if I had slightly higher stats but\u2026'I can't keep running until the timer runs out either\u2026!'I should have known what they wanted as soon as they provided a sword.Die running or turn around and fight.I kept peeking back to the golem as I ran.'Fuck, how am I supposed to beat that?'But I didn't have another choice.There's no way this sword would do anything to the golem.But\u2026'I have to fight.'If running away wasn't the answer, there had to be another breakthrough.I drew on all possible knowledge I had on sand golems.One thing I gained from the last 7 years of training is an abundance of theory matched by even the most experienced of hunters.There had to be at least one method that would apply to this situation.Monsters like golems stop moving when you break their cores.And low-tier monsters like sand golems don't even hide their cores within their bodies.They are evaluated to be E-rank monsters because they keep their core on the outer layer of their body.I could see a scarlet core bulging from its body.But I didn't have the confidence to be able to get that close to it.Even if I was able to get close, it was obvious what level of damage this sword would do to that core.No, I didn't know if this sword would be able to leave even a crack on it.Even so.'I have to go\u2026!'Looking back, it seemed that the golem was about 50ft away from me.Would I be able to run at the golem and dodge its attacks?No, I couldn't think like that.Contemplating more wouldn't alleviate this situation.'I have to dodge it!'Whoosh!I ran toward the golem after I made my decision.50 feet\u2026 40 feet\u2026 30 feet\u2026 20 feet\u2026The closer I got, the more strongly I could feel the physical difference between us.The gigantic E-rank beast made my heart shrink with a glance.I felt like throwing up, but I kept running.The only other monster I had ever faced was a small goblin in the hunter exam.I had no choice but to succeed now.I kept my eyes on the golem as I approached the base of its foot.Voom\u2026\u2026!Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe rough sediment arm ripped through the air and accelerated towards me.An attack strong enough to immediately rip me to shreds.I stared straight at it and jumped in its way.When the colossal arm reached the front of my face, I slid right below it and just barely managed to dodge it.Bang!Sand blasted everywhere as it followed the thundering boom of the impact.Due to its massive size, there were huge delays between each of its moves.By the time I realized this, I was already running.My body knew even before my head.I had to thrust this sword into the golem's core if I wanted to live.I nimbly approached the core as the golem still struggled to recover its stance from the last attack.Clang~!The tip of the sword rang as it made contact with the golem's core.Of course.A golem's core wouldn't be broken with an impact like that.Crack\u2026!The core was left with a slight fracture\u2026Whoosh!\u201cGraaaaaaa~!\u201dAnd the golem was on its way to throw a second attack.When my eyes caught that, I threw my body with no time to react.Shaaaa!Then\u2014Whoosh\u2026\u2026!The follow-up blow just barely missed the top of my head.Pure luck.There was nothing else that could describe this.I didn't stop despite the sand scraping all of the skin off my leg.Please\u2026 Please break this time!At the moment when the sword hit the core\u2014CRACK!\u300c Sand golem's core has been destroyed. \u300dThe system message blocked my view as the light in the golem's scarlet eyes dimmed.As they dimmed, the golem's body crumbled back into a pile of sand.Shwaa\u2026.!\u300c Time left \u2013 7min 8sec \u300d\u300c Tutorial trial over. \u300dI collapsed as soon as I saw the message.\u201cGasp, gasp\u2026.!\u201dMy legs burned as the sand crawled into my scraped skin and my hands couldn't stop shaking.My lungs felt like they were about to rip open and my leg continued to bleed.But for some reason, I felt a rush of adrenaline I had never felt before.The feeling of victory that I hadn't experienced in 7 years.I was only able to figure out what really happened after I caught my breath.\u201c\u2026\u2026I killed a sand golem? Me?\u201dSomeone who couldn't even hope to kill an F rank monster\u2026Managed to kill an E-rank monster when his life was at risk.But I became depressed again after looking back at what had happened.'\u2026I barely managed to survive.'If this was a different E-rank monster, I would have died within 3 minutes.Sand golems are slow and have a clear weakness.If this was a slightly stronger player, this would have been an easy tutorial.It didn't matter.\u201cI survived.\u201dThat was reality.When I was finally about to feel a wave of relief\u2014\u300c Congratulations. You have overcome the Tower of Trials floor 1. \u300dThe message continued after the congratulations.\u300c As a reward, you have received 'Unlock innate ability.' \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received '1000 points.' \u300d\u300c As a bonus reward, you have received the skill 'Accelerated Regeneration(E+)' \u300d\u300c As a bonus reward, you have received '500 points.' \u300dI finally remembered the message I saw when I first entered this field.'It did say that\u2026'\u300c Trial success reward \u2013 Unlocking innate ability \u300dI wasn't able to process it properly at the time, but there was definitely a reward.And\u2026\u201cAn innate ability\u2026\u201dIt was something I couldn't even imagine unlocking over the last 7 years, let alone an additional reward of a skill.'I couldn't even increase my stat after training for 7 years\u2026'I was more dumbfounded now than when I first entered the tower.The next couple of messages seemed to confirm what had just happened.\u300c Innate ability unlocked. \u300d\u300c Innate ability 'Necromancy(F)' has been imprinted on the player. \u300dI won against a monster for the first time in my life and was able to see progress that had been halted for 7 years.There were feelings I couldn't even begin to describe with words, but that didn't last long.Almost as if it didn't want to give me time to wonder\u2014\u300c Please move to the waiting area. \u300dVoom!A blue portal appeared where the body of the golem once stood.I guess I was supposed to go to the 'waiting room' using that.That alone explained a lot.\u201cThis is really a tutorial\u2026?\u201dDungeons resolve after it has been completed but that didn't seem to be the case for the 'Tower of Trials.'I couldn't deny my reality any longer.What I had just experienced was a tutorial. Preparation for what's to come in this tower.Meaning, I will need to go through trials like this again and again with no end in sight.I had no idea what to think of this, but that also didn't last too long.Gasping for air, I got up with a groan.'Damnit, it hurts like hell.'There was not a single unscathed part on my body.I must have rolled in the sand too much trying to dodge the sand golem.Well, I shouldn't complain considering that I was still alive.As I was about to pass by the sand pile that used to be the golem\u2014What\u2026?\u201cWhat is this?\u201dA scene overwhelming enough to make me forget my pain for a moment.The pile of sand that used to be the golem emitted a black fog.I was hesitant at this unreal phenomenon, but for some reason, I reached out my hand.Then\u2026\u300c Activating innate ability 'Necromancy(F)' \u300d\u300c Would you like to absorb the spirit of the sand golem? \u300d\u300c Y/N \u300dYet again, a message I'd never seen before appeared in front of me.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The alternative was death.High risk, high reward.This was the system perpetrated by the Tower of Trials.The higher I get\u2026The riskier these trials would get.\u201cDamn it\u2026\u201dNo matter how good the reward was, failing could result in instant death.And unlike a dungeon, you couldn't escape after clearing a floor.\u201cPretty inhospitable for a host.\u201dIt was a crazy risk that no sane person would take.I wanted to become a hunter because I was sick of being powerless and wanted to avenge my parents.'But all that becomes useless if I die.'I didn't want to continue fighting carrying this risk.Because I also unlocked my innate ability, there was even less reason for me to carry on with this risk.I could become a hunter if I got back with this skill.But\u2026\u201cI'll only get to make that choice if I survive.\u201dThat means I'll need to learn how to use all the resources I've been given.I stood up and agreed to the message about absorbing the soul.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the sand golem. \u300d\u300c Number of souls in possession \u2013 1/5 \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 7% \u300dAt the same time, the black fog flew into my body.Shhhhhh\u2026!It was a strange sensation.'I somehow know exactly how to use my innate ability.'I knew that I could enhance my stats just by wishing for it at any time.This is probably how all the other hunters felt when they unlocked their innate abilities.I was just a little behind.\u300c Permanently increasing your stats using the souls in captivity. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 3. \u300d\u300c Stamina increased by 2. \u300d\u300c Number of souls in possession \u2013 0/5 \u300dA weight lifted from my shoulders and my entire body felt more energized.An unknown sense of enhancement overtook my body but\u2026'No need to try it out now.'I was still covered in injuries, so I didn't want to test it right away.Then I continued to the portal where the golem once used to stand.The moment I reached the portal.\u300c Moving to the waiting room. \u300dMy surroundings changed again.Voom!The first thing I saw was a rectangular, stone room.\u300c You have entered the 2nd-floor waiting room. \u300d\u300c Healing all injuries and status ailments. \u300d\u300c The healing effect is constantly applied in the waiting room. \u300dThe messages appeared in the air, and my injuries started disappearing.'It's not even that surprising anymore.'I guess I was starting to get used to this.When my pain faded completely, I checked up on my body.As the message said, all of my injuries were gone.It was almost as if my battle with the sand golem was nothing but a dream.'No way it was though.'Just one look at my clothes could show that it wasn't.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAs if the tower wanted to do the bare minimum, it left my clothes in tatters while healing me.I shook off the sand stuck to my clothes.I guess some sand got in my mouth because my throat felt scratchy.'At least they heal your body after a trial ends.'One less problem to worry about.When I calmed down enough, I started noticing more things in my surroundings.'This is really spacious, but it feels so empty.'Even if this was supposed to be a waiting area, the only word to describe this place was desolate.They did have a bed in the corner though.'It doesn't even seem like a good one.'I should be thankful that they even had a bed.Plop.My head filled with thoughts as I stared into the ceiling.'What should I do now? Can I even escape from here?'My future seemed bleak.Hm\u2026'For what purpose was I called here?'But\u2026'I don't get it.'All my questions were answered by 'I don't know.' or 'nothing I can do about it.'I didn't even know what was going to happen on this floor, let alone if I could return to Earth\u2026Anything was possible.While I was laying down and letting my thoughts wander\u2014\u300c All tutorial trials of every difficulty have been completed. \u300d\u300c Activating the 'Tower of Trials' system. \u300dA row of text emerged as the message appeared.\u300c You are now able to use these commands. \u300d\u300c Information, marketplace, community, inventory, trial. \u300d\u300c Commands will execute as you say them orally. \u300dThe messages stopped after that.That finally broke my train of thought.\u201c\u2026Yeah, I have to get a hold of myself now.\u201dThere wasn't anything I could change about my situation right now.I just needed to find out more about this tower and how I could keep on surviving.I pondered my next steps in bed when I finally opened my mouth.\u201cTrial.\u201d\u300c Floor 2 trial starting in \u2013 23hrs 21min \u300d\u300c Trial cannot be selected at this time. Please wait. \u300dAs I thought, the trials would continue.I moved on to test the more intuitive commands.\u201cInventory.\u201dAs the name suggested, it seemed like a storage unit.A game-like inventory window appeared where items could be stored.'I can't store a large number of items but it's pretty useful,'I had no idea how it worked but it was another useful tool in my arsenal.\u201cMarketplace.\u201dThis was also an intuitive command that triggered an Amazon-like website shopping window to appear.I couldn't sell anything, but it looked like I could buy something at any time.From small, useless items to weapons and even furniture.Thousands of items were being sold in the marketplace tab.I didn't want to use the marketplace before trying out the other commands, so I decided to move on.Only 2 more left.Information and community.\u201cInformation.\u201dSomething I needed the most right now.When I said the command an unexpected window came up.\u300c Please ask a question. \u300d\u300c The administrator will answer the submitted question. \u300d\u300c Currently available questions \u2013 1 \u300dIt was just a window to submit questions to the administrator.An administrator.So even if this Tower of Trials is a natural phenomenon, it still has an administrator?I wasn't sure, but there was nothing I could do about that now.I was wondering what to ask when I saw the fine print.\u300c You are able to ask 1 question when entering a new floor. \u300d\u300c Questions can be accumulated. \u300d'Hm, I'll hold off for now.'I'd have to be cautious with my question since I only have one.It said it could be accumulated, so there was no rush to ask one right now.I could decide after taking a look at the community.\u300c You have entered the community. \u300d\u300c Difficulty \u2013 Hard \u300d\u300c Floor 2 Community (3971/4321) \u300dLee Seungjin: Can anyone explain what's going on?Park Jinwoo: Fuck, is this the second Great Calamity?Lee Heejin: All my stats and skills reset. What should I do?Park Chansuk: What the fuck. Give me my stats back.Kim Seunghoon: Stfu. You think you're the only one this happened to?Hyuk Sukjin: I'm not even a hunter. Why did I get sucked into this?Park Chansuk: You're not even a player? How did you get here then?Hyuk Sukjin: Why the fuck are you asking me? And they just awakened me at the start of the tutorial.I stared at the onslaught of messages and blinked.'Community is like an actual communication network?'Most people were posting messages stemming from pure confusion.Chaos.The only word fit to describe what was happening.But there were still things to be learned from them.\u201cI wasn't the only one who got dragged in here.\u201dMore than an insignificant portion of the people were also dragged in here without context.There were also some hunters.They were busy crying about the loss of their stats and skills.My hope that they would be able to save us quickly died.They wouldn't be able to help anyone being in the same boat.\u201cWait a minute\u2026\u201dA lot of people mentioned not having their skills and stats anymore.'I guess it didn't apply to me because my stats never changed.'But to hunters, it was the end of their world.A couple of people claimed that they weren't even hunters when they got dragged here.It couldn't be a lie because dozens of people were claiming the same thing.'Maybe this really is the second Great Calamity.'Otherwise, how would this all make sense?'Not like I could do anything even if it was the second coming.'There was a variety of information to be found from the chat.But that didn't last long.Even after some time had passed, the chatting room was still in a state of chaos.'There's still a lot of people who don't understand what's going on.'The chatting room is just filled with random messages about the Great Calamity and curses.Or it was just hunters complaining about the loss of their abilities.Although understandable, it was unrelated to me.I had nothing to lose anyway.It helped me keep my composure compared to the others.\u201cThere's not much to gain from this anymore.\u201dAs I was about to test the other commands\u2014\u300c Administrator \u56d7\u56d7\u56d7 has entered the chat. \u300dA huge notification arose on top of the community tab.The stream of messages broke and the chatting stopped.\u300c Chatting is forbidden now. \u300d'The administrator entering and the chat closing\u2026\u2026'You never get a lot of time to react to an anomaly.\u56d7\u56d7\u56d7: There is an announcement for all the challengers who passed the tutorial.Messages started to show up on the frozen chatroom.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Just how we can use the points? Really?Kim Seunghoon: Fucking shit. I'm gonna climb up and kill him.Lee Seungjin: You got anger issues or something? Stop cursing so much.Lee Heejin: If all their skills and stats got reset it's understandable.Hyuk Sukjin: Excuse me? Admin? Can you please tell us a way to get back?Park Jinwoo: Does this mean we're never getting back?I read the flood of messages as I gathered my thoughts.\u201cLike it or not, we'd better get used to it.\u201dIt's likely impossible to climb this tower in a short amount of time.We're probably going to be here for a while.Would it be possible to stay in the waiting area the whole time?Probably not.'Points can only be earned in the trials.'That means I won't be able to wait it out here.I can only go so far with the points I earned from the tutorial.After a quick look at the marketplace, 1500 points was clearly not enough.'Within the tower, you will not be allowed a single drop of water without points.'The only solution was to go through the trials.I sighed as I stared at the sword I laid next to the bed.A well-sharpened longsword that I received from the tutorial.'I don't know if that can get me through the second trial.'If the second trial is anything like the first\u2026\u201cI could die.\u201dEven with the extra stats from the spirit I absorbed, I was barely an F-rank player.My capabilities hadn't exceeded those of a normal human's yet.I needed something that I could use to protect myself.As a lowest-ranked player, I had to rely on equipment.'I don't think the sword will be enough.'I'd tried out different weapons in the last 7 years, so I knew how to handle most weapons.There was no real reason to choose a different weapon and throw away this sword.'Jack of all trades, master of none.'My lack of talent was no exception even when it came to weapons.Same with techniques that just used my body.A spear might be best for a beginner.'But there's no reason to spend points to get one.'At the very least, I needed something defensive to increase my chances of survival.'Preferably something that could block or misdirect attacks.'My body wasn't built to take multiple hits from monsters.\u201cMarketplace.\u201dI pondered for an hour before making a decision.The basic sword was about 30 inches long. Not too short.I had some experience using a sword and a shield at the training center, so I decided to buy a shield.It may sound basic, but it was a good combination that worked well together.Even experienced hunters used either a sword or spear combined with a shield.I browsed for a bit until I found one similar enough to the one I used before.'The closer it is to the practice shield, the more I'll be used to it.'I'll still practice just in case.\u300c You have bought a Crude Dwarf Shield(E). \u300d\u300c 700 points deducted. \u300d\u300c Remaining balance \u2013 800 \u300dA little expensive, but it was made of high-quality timber.People might think wooden shields are weak, but that's not always the case.\u300c Crude Dwarf Shield \u300d\u300c Grade: E \u300d\u300c One-handed shield crafted by a beginner dwarf. \u300d\u300c Surrounded by a layer of metal, it is stronger than it looks. \u300dThe Great Calamity changed everything.Seemingly fragile shields like this were light and sturdy because of their high rank.It exceeded anything made before the calamity.\u201cThis is worth at least $30,000 in real life\u2026\u201dMy sense of money numbed a little.It's because I just got my hands on something that even officially registered hunters couldn't get.I guess it didn't matter because I couldn't even take it with me.Calmed down, I positioned myself in a stance with my new shield.My posture was pretty decent. I guess the training wasn't that worthless.The equipment also felt so much lighter now that my stats had increased.This was the best condition I'd ever been in.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksIt helped that I also bought a shield I was pretty used to.After testing it out, I put the sword and shield down to browse the marketplace again.'The admin said that everything had to be obtained using points.'That means there were smaller items I also had to get.From the looks of it, the marketplace had enough variety to have some of the things I was looking for.If I was a normal civilian, I would have had trouble in choosing what to buy. However\u2026\u300c Strength Potion \u300d\u300c Grade: F- \u300d\u300c A special potion that recovers a small amount of strength. \u300d\u300c Slightly relieves fatigue. \u300d\u300c Regeneration Potion \u300d\u300c Grade: F- \u300d\u300c A spraying potion that heals injuries. \u300d\u300c Limited only to light outer wounds. \u300d\u300c Decrepit Throwing Knife \u300d\u300c Grade: F- \u300d\u300c An old throwing knife with dulled edges. \u300d\u300c So old that it may be destroyed upon contact. \u300dAll the items I wanted were in the store, so I didn't hesitate.I only bought items I needed in an emergency.Ones that could maximize my point use.\u300c Remaining balance \u2013 375 \u300dI had just enough points left to buy some food.'This should be enough to keep me alive for a bit.'The strength potion could get me through prolonged fights, and the regeneration potion could take care of emergencies.The throwing knife was for unexpected situations.As someone who'd been looking at hunters for 7 years, this was probably my best bet.\u201cI think that's enough battle equipment for now\u2026\u201dWondering what to do next, I quickly thought of an answer.There was still a lot of time left before the next trial so I should take this time to get used to the weapons.I still wasn't used to the sword, and the shield was a little different from what I was used to.If I couldn't get accustomed to them, it would cost me my life in a battle.Both my mind and body were in top shape from the healing effects.And even if I did tire out from training, the waiting area would quickly recover me.The obvious choice would be to warm my body up for the next trial.\u300c Floor 2 Community (3928/4321) \u300d\u300c Floor 2 trial starting in \u2013 20hrs 53min \u300dI moved the Community and the starting time to the corner of my eyes.I had to keep my eyes on those windows even while I was training.'There might be some useful information.'After the admin left, the situation calmed down a little and the community seemed to organize itself.But that thought quickly left after seeing the following messages.Kang Sunwoo: Holy shit. I can't use the sword or the shield because all my skills are gone. Fuck.Lee Heejin: Me too. I'm a magic user and I don't know what to do without any of my skills.Kim SeungHoon: I don't care about that. I just hate how low my stats are right now.Lee Seungjin: I got my skill but I have to build up proficiency again. Damn.Oh Choonsuk: At least you hunters know what to do. What are normal people like me supposed to do? Can I even pass the 2nd floor?Kang Sunwoo: I don't know. But you should buy a sword or a spear with a shield and practice as much as possible.Lee Seungjin: God damn. I wouldn't have to do this if I had my skills. This shitty ass admin.There wasn't much difference between the messages.Anxiousness, nervousness, and despair.None of the things they talked about even applied to me.I wasn't a hunter, nor a civilian.'I guess my lack of talent kind of helped me.'Because I was no different from when I was outside of the tower.No, I grew within the tower.Maybe this was a blessing I received for suffering the last 7 years.'Let's think positive thoughts.'Realistically, the only thing I could do here is train.The playing field was even now that everything had been reset.But there was still a difference.They'd be able to learn previously learned skills and build up proficiency much faster than I would be able to.'If I want to catch up, I need to keep on training.'My growth will directly impact my survival.I'd have to train two or three times harder than everyone else.That way, I'd at least be able to stand side by side with them.I have to move my body until it can react before my brain can tell it what we do.I was a different person from someone who wanted to give up just a few hours ago.Innate ability, skill, stats, etc\u2026I'd gained so many things in the last couple of hours and lost my will to give up.'If I can adapt, improvise, and overcome, I'll be able to be a hunter.'My times of powerlessness are over.If I live, I'd be able to get everything I'd ever dreamt of.No, I'd be able to gain more.The tower wasn't a place for me to die a futile death.The trials would give me rewards and award me points.That could make me stronger and possibly show me the way out of this tower.My first goal was evident.'Clear the 2nd trial.'And if that's what the tower wanted, I'd do it.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We don't have any other urges. Why am I still hungry?Kang Sunwoo: Y'all really talking about food at this time. Just go buy some jerky from the marketplace. It's the cheapest thing you can get.Oh Choonsuk: Tyty. Good advice.Snap!\u201cIt's already time.\u201dI stretched while looking at the Community.20 hours had already passed while I'd been rolling around the waiting area training.I learned a lot during that time.The cheapest food in the marketplace, and how the waiting area works.'I learned the most about the waiting area.'You cannot feel most biological urges besides hunger in this area.I also learned that the healing in the area isn't omnipotent.'You can barely call it healing.'As an experiment, I cut my hand a while ago and the spilled blood went back into my wound before closing.Spilled blood going back to where it came from isn't normally 'healing.'It's closer to restoration.However, it does not restore you to a point in time when you were not hungry anymore.That means it's probably possible to starve to death.'I also learned how to switch the healing on and off.'There wasn't anything else particularly useful.I have yet to try them out because they cost points.Turning the healing on and off cost 100 points total.Seeing that I only have 373 points, I have to limit my spending.Although when I do gain enough points, I'll have to try them out.I finished my train of thought and bought a jerky.Chomp chomp.\u201cIt's hard and tasteless.\u201dI toiled through the jerky that didn't even have salt on it.But at 10 points per piece, it was the most efficient use of your points.Anything cheaper could barely be consumed by humans.They said that you couldn't even chew through the black bread, made from flour and sand, as well as other cheaper foods.It wasn't really edible. Just something to fill your stomach with.'I wouldn't be able to survive on that.\u201dSo the jerky was the best choice at the moment.Still chewing on it, I bought some water and first aid items.I had to be ready for anything.\u300c Points remaining \u2013 40 \u300d\u201cI barely have any left.\u201dI wouldn't have had any left if I didn't get the bonus award.I could tell that was the case from looking at the Community.Lee Heejin: I can't buy any medical supplies because I don't have any points; Why are magic items so expensive;Kim Seunghoon: Magic is op in the beginning. Of course it's expensive.Hyuk Sukjin: Am I the only one who got a bonus reward? I have a decent amount of points from that.Kim Seunghoon: I got one but mine was a skill and not points. What?Oh Choonsuk: I didn't get anything like that. What? Did you give the admin money or something?Lee Heejin: Huh? I didn't get it either.Only a small minority received the bonus award.Most people in the Community seem to be hearing about the bonus award for the first time.'Does it depend on how well you did in the tutorial?'Everyone who got a bonus award said they only received either points or a skill.But\u2026\u201cI got both?\u201dHm\u2026Maybe there were special requirements to unlock the bonus rewards.Like if you killed the enemy when the goal of the trial was to survive.'Maybe that's why I got two bonus rewards.'That means I had to figure out what those requirements were in the upcoming trials.I needed to figure it out if I wanted any advantage over the other people climbing the tower.The difficulty I chose was also the highest of the three.If an E-rank monster appeared in the tutorial, the chances are, it was only going to get worse.'Good thing I trained nonstop.'I felt like the sword and shield were a part of my body.At this point, even a sand golem shouldn't be too much of a problem for me.'I have a shield now too.'Storing all the equipment into my inventory, I checked the time.\u300c Floor 2 trial starting in \u2013 17min 17secs \u300dQuite a bit of time passed while I was training and looking through the marketplace.The messages in the Community slowed down as well.Oh Choonsuk: The tutorial was hard as fuck\u2026 How hard is the 2nd floor gonna be?Hyuk Sukjin: I don't need to awaken or anything. I just wanna go home.Kim Seunghoon: Stop pissing in your pants and get ready to fight.Lee Jinwoo: Fuck, I really don't wanna go.

No one plans an assassination\u2026It's probably happened once or twice but\u2026Doesn't seem very common.This didn't bother me much though.It didn't change what I had to do.\u201cWhatever they want.\u201dThat's how this tower works.Then\u2014\u300c Opening the map of the 2nd floor's trial. \u300d\u300c Indicating the orc tribe's location on the map. \u300dFollowing the message, a map popped up in the corner of my eye.I thought the hard difficulty would be merciless.I guess the tower had a smidge of a conscience.After looking at the map, I understood why I needed a map.An obscure location in the middle of the woods.Without the map, it would have taken a week to find them.The tower didn't see locating the orcs as a part of the trial.\u201cThat gets rid of the need to go explore the forest.\u201dThis was already a huge positive.I had a couple of days worth of food and water in the inventory so I didn't have to worry about that either.I had some potions for emergencies and a bunch of things prepared.\u201cLet's go.\u201dI moved slowly with the sword and shield in my hands.About halfway to the marked location, I laid low and started crawling.I can't call this a hunter's strategy, but it's what I came up with after thinking for a while.'The orcs might notice me if they had any scouts.'If the trials were mimicking dungeons, that was completely possible.It would be difficult to avoid the scouts unless you had a special item or a skill.Although a normal hunter would be sure to have one of those\u2026Since I had neither, this was my best bet.'I should be cautious if I don't want to get caught.'I kept low and crawled forward.\u201cShiek, shieek.\u201dMy body froze as the sound landed on my ears.The breathing of an E-rank beast, an orc.With slight hesitation, I continued to go forward.Farther up ahead, a scene opened up through the edge of the grass.A roughly sharpened wooden fence, and two monsters guarding it.'Orc guards.'The breath I heard earlier was probably also from a guard.\u201cShieeek.\u201dCovered in leather armor, equipped with a greatsword, they looked tough.\u201cI want to keep observing them but\u2026.\u201dSince I finished my examination, I should retreat and strategize.If an orc guard discovers me, I'd be forced to fight.And that decreases my chances of survival.I slowly distanced myself from their village and stood up to inspect the nearby area.Now that I had found the orcs, I needed a place to observe them without being caught.'Mana dense enough to host monsters and this humidity\u2026 It should be here\u2026 '\u300c Heavenly Mud \u300d\u300c Grade: F \u300d\u300c Manfilled mud that's generated in mana dense areas. \u300d\u300c Rubbing it on your body prevents you from being discovered by smell and sight. \u300d\u300c The effect only lasts for 12 hours and has a terrible stench for the duration. \u300d\u2026found it.'I guess this is here too.'I'd only ever heard about mud that was integrated with mana in dungeons.The tower was indeed pretty similar to dungeons.'I can use some of my knowledge here too.'Scooping mud from the nearby puddle, I covered myself in mud.The scent reminded me of a rotting piece of meat, but that didn't matter.I didn't know about other monsters, but this would be enough to get past the orcs.'Monsters like goblins and orcs can't detect you past this mud.''Now, what should I do\u2026'Normally, if orc guards were dispatched in a dungeon, that means there would be 'hunters' and 'workers.'Guards, hunters, workers, and the chief.Orcs had clear and distinct roles.'Orcs that know how to coordinate, at least an E-rank trial.'It's not at a level that I can clear easily.I might not be able to beat it even if I risked my life.As long as the orc hunters were stationed, I would never be able to overpower them.'You need an E-rank party to kill an orc hunter, so there's no way I can do it alone.'Objectively, because I was physically weak, I had no chance of winning a direct confrontation.One thing that could work for me was my innate ability.But even that wouldn't activate unless I killed something.'How can I kill the chief?'At that moment, something crazy popped up in my head.No, there was one way.As long as I don't limit my target to just the 'chief\u2026'\u201c\u2026There is a way. To kill all the orcs.\u201d____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What's hesitation going to do for me?\u201dAlthough it was strange that the goal of the trial was 'assassination,' the trial made it very hard to do so.The fence seemed very sturdy, and the pure number of orcs made it hard to sneak in no matter the time of day.'I won't even be able to run away if I fail my assassination attempt.'There'd be too much risk involved to try to sneak in.But causing a fire was different.'All orc hunters go hunting early in the morning.'Contrary to their looks, they were a hard-working species.And one characteristic of the orc species is that once they left, they didn't come back to their tribe until sundown.Looking at the sun, it should be around noon right now.'They should be far away enough from their village now\u2026 'I'd be able to fight them without their main source of strength.With a chunk of their military missing, my chances of picking them off increased drastically.It was just a stereotype that all orcs can fight.'Even the same species of monsters have rankings.'The worker orcs had been designated as workers because they weren't fit to fight.And the guard orcs are the orcs who weren't good enough to be a hunter orc.'The number of guards in the front and the scale of the fence suggests there aren't too many of them.'Conservatively, there should be two or three guards and just one old orc as their chief.The Hunter Association released an official statement saying that the oldest orc becomes the chief of the tribe, so that information should be accurate.If I could cause a commotion while most of their military might was away, I had a chance of being able to obliterate them.'I just have to stay calm and decrease their numbers\u2026'It would change the tide of the battle.That meant I had to kill at least two or three orcs while they were confused.'I'm not strong enough to fight them at the gate entrance.''I need to raise my strength to at least 20.'If I had enough strength to be able to go head to head with an orc, everything would go much more smoothly.There was a chance that the orcs could group together, but the chances of that were low.'Typically, they would get some water if they think they can handle the fire.'Then most orcs would head to the nearby river or lake for some water.The busiest orcs would be the worker orcs.And I could take that time to kill them once they were far enough from the village.'If there's a risk of death no matter what I do, I have to choose the most sure-fire plan.'That hadn't changed from the tutorial.Rather than run around looking for an exit that may or may not exist, I chose to fight the sand golem with the given weapon.Because that was more certain.I was the only one who stood to lose anything from being hesitant.I had to kill before I was killed.I kept this in my mind as I took a step forward.Now was the time to act.After finishing my preparations, I started moving towards the mark on the map.There wasn't any time to waste.I laid low on the ground again while I crawled through the grass.'I did cover myself in heavenly mud, but I can never be too careful.'I'd only ever learned about this in books, so it was my first time putting this into practice.One mistake could end up costing my life.Shieek shiek.After some time, I heard the orcs beyond the grass again.I kept my breath steady while slowly crawling.Occasionally observing the guards with my breath held.No matter how strong these sentry orcs were, there weren't that many of them.They were just kept near the village as a backup when the hunters were away.'They probably think they can deal with invasions as long as a couple of them stay.'This was also a characteristic of the orc species.According to the Hunter Association, the guard orcs aren't always on patrol.'They go back to the village for meals and lunch.'They don't stay for too long but it's still useful information.'There are cases where the workers go on patrol instead due to a lack of guards but that's not important to me.'Worker orcs tended to be much weaker than the other types of orcs.If these guards ran to their water source, I'd just have to take care of them secretly from the back.But before then, I had to go unnoticed and stay totally silent.After all, the mud only masked the scent and sight.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThis was the most important part of the plan.Every bodily muscle stiffened up as I observed my surroundings.Just as my legs were about to fall asleep\u2014\u201cShiek, shieek!\u201dOne of the guards breathed out heavily as he waved to the other.'Did they see me\u2026\u2026?'I instinctively opened my inventory to prepare for a battle, but I realized that I was mistaken.Step, step.Looking exhausted, the guards yawned and stepped back into the wooden fence.This was what I was waiting for.I might not get another chance.I quietly got up and chose a location to set on fire.Tall grass and wooden fence, it was perfect for spreading fire.I took out the torch from the inventory.Brooosh!The fire spread itself to the grass as if it had a life of its own.I carried it over to the fence and the nearby trees to spread it further.Brooooshh\u2026\u2026.!The smoke filled the air in an instant.I tossed the torch on the other side to invoke another fire.I thought this might be too much fire to lead out just an orc or two but\u2026What could I do?Better bigger than smaller.I hid behind one of the unaffected trees and waited for their response.The workers should be coming out soon to take this out.'This should be small enough for them to rush to stop it.'The spread was fast, but it wasn't to a point where you couldn't stop it.After a short wait,\u201cShiek? Shieeeek!\u201dI heard a panicked scream beyond the fence.Following that, an orc ran towards the fire in a rush.'Is it a sentry?'No.He wasn't armed. It was a worker orc.\u201cSh-Shiek? Shiek, shieeeek!\u201dHe looked in horror as the flames got bigger.Taken back, he stood there, confused as to what to do next.Then.I took my first steps towards it.There would never be a more perfect chance.'He's not even a guard who can effectively fight back.'I didn't give it much thought and moved according to my plan.Running towards his back, I push off the ground and close the distance.Tat, tat, tat!\u201cSh-shieek\u2026?!\u201dAs the orc turned around in a panic\u2014Stab!\u201cSh-Shiek, shiek, shieeeek.\u201dI shoved the sword I took out of my inventory into its stomach.There was no way he could have reacted to this.Without even being able to let out so much of a squeal, the orc stumbled backward, letting out voiceless screams.Some may sympathize with the monsters, but I was far from it.It was their fault that my life was ruined.\u201cTake that, you bastard.\u201dRather than feeling guilt or excitement, my heartbeat slowed down.I pulled my sword out to thrust it straight through its heart.There was no hesitation.\u201cSh\u2026..iek.\u201dThe orc let out a weak breath before being enveloped by a black fog.Yes, this was what I was waiting for.\u300c Activating innate ability 'Necromancy(F)' \u300d\u300c Would you like to absorb the spirit of the orc? \u300d\u300c Y/N \u300dI placed the orc's corpse down so it wouldn't make a noise and pressed 'Y.'\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the orc. \u300d\u300c Number of souls in possession \u2013 1/5 \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 9% \u300dI exchanged the soul for stats as soon as I absorbed it.\u300c Permanently increasing your stats using the souls in captivity. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 4. \u300d\u300c Agility increased by 2. \u300d\u300c Number of souls in possession \u2013 0/5 \u300dI opened my status window as I felt a rush of adrenaline.\u300c Han Sungyeun \u300d\u300c Strength \u2013 16 \u300d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u300c Stamina \u2013 11 \u300d\u300c Agility \u2013 11 \u300d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u300c Mana \u2013 8 \u300d\u300c Innate ability \u2013 'Necromancy(F) \u300d\u300c Skill \u2013 Accelerated Regeneration(E+) \u300d'My strength is nearing 20 now.'My stamina and agility also passed 10 and are on their way to 20 as well.I should be able to handle an orc in a direct battle now.But I didn't get long to give myself a pat on the back.\u201c Sh-shieeeeek!\u201dThis time, it was a fully armed guard orc.But I wasn't scared like last time.I'd have been unsure if there were 2 orcs, but he came alone.Feeling blessed, I muttered a word underneath my breath.\u201cInventory.\u201dI took out my shield and stood face to face with the orc.Showtime.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

ThanksSket!I swung my sword as their spears and swords bounced off my shield.Unable to react due to the recoil, a vertical red line formed on the orc's stomach.Puaaak!Its stomach split and vomited out the inner organs.Even this didn't invoke any emotion in me.More accurately, I didn't have time to feel anything yet.Although I took care of the spear orc, the sword orc was still standing tall.Feeling something was a luxury I couldn't afford in battle.'All I have to do is stay calm.'I took a step back to regain my breath.After wiping the splattered blood from my cheeks, I rushed towards the rest of the orcs.Feigning retreat then rushing back in.The inexperienced worker orc couldn't even react to this.The guard orc realized this and finally gave up on hovering the chief but\u2026It was already too late.Shing!When I sliced open the last worker orc's throat, the guard orc let out an anger-filled roar.\u201cShieeeeeeeeek!\u201dIt was as if its murderous gaze was saying:\u201cI will slice you in two.\u201dHe slammed down his greatsword, fully intending to cut right through the shield.My instincts told me that my E-rank shield wouldn't last this blow.And even if it did, it would break the left wrist that was holding the shield.Would I be able to fight without my left hand?No, I wouldn't stand a chance.If I couldn't block it, I'd have to redirect it.I tilted my shield to have the blade of the greatsword slide off.In the past, I wouldn't have been able to pull this off, but it was different now.Skkkkkkkt\u2026!\u201cShi-shieeek?\u201dAs the weight of the sword pulled the orc down to the ground, I stabbed mine into its abdomen.Pshh!The blood stained the pierced leather armor as I pulled the sword out to take another swing.Shuaat!He clutched his stomach as he took a step back.\u201cSh\u2026.ieeek\u2026.\u201dHis knees met the ground as his stuttering cries died out.Boom.He fell face down on the ground and I stabbed my sword into his head again.I couldn't let my guard down just yet.The guard orc's muscles finally relaxed as the lifeless body laid on the floor.Now the orc chief was all that was left.Then\u2026\u201cSh-shieeek! S-sheeik!\u201dThe terrified chief held onto his staff and continued to mutter under his breath.When the rambling stopped\u2013Boosh!A giant fireball appeared in front of the chief.It was only then that I realized what the chief orc was doing.'I was wondering why the guard stayed put till the end\u2026'They were just protecting the chief until he had enough time to finish his incantation.The worker orcs were only there to keep me occupied.Of course, they only did so because they didn't expect me to kill any of them.I knew that the most experienced hunter orc became the chief but,I didn't expect this to be the case.'Why would an orc be a mage\u2026!'That didn't change what I had to do though.Broosh!I crouched my entire body and hid behind my shield as the ball of fire hurled towards me.This wasn't very effective.Boooom!With the impact on the shield, my vision went red.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026\u2026!\u201dEvery inch of my skin broiled as the scent of burning flesh filled the air.Even then\u2013\u201cArgggggg\u2026.!\u201dI stayed put with every ounce of my mental strength.I didn't realize how painful it was to be burned alive.It was to the point where I'd rather rip the burning skin off myself.In agonizing pain, I slowly stepped forward.It was the only thing I could do at this time.\u300c 'Endurer of fire' achievement unlocked. \u300d\u300c 'Heat Endurance' skill generated. \u300dA couple of messages popped up, but I had no idea what they said.I couldn't think of anything besides staying conscious.I did know one thing for sure.Szzzzzzz.\u201cUgh.

You have overcome the Tower of Trials floor 2 \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received the item 'Assassin's Cloak(D).' \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received the item 'Obsidian Dagger(E+).' \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received '2000 points.' \u300d\u300c As a bonus reward, you have received the skill 'Pain Tolerance (D)' \u300d\u300c As a bonus reward, you have received '1000 points.' \u300d\u300c Please move to the waiting area. \u300dMy head was spinning.I felt messages pop up, but I couldn't tell for sure.Accelerated regeneration wasn't even working because the wounds were too severe.I waved my hand to push the messages aside.I could always look at the messages in the waiting area.But not those.The burning remnants of the orc corpses.All of my attention was focused on the black fog emitting from their burning bodies.I'd be losing out if I didn't absorb all of them.But I was at a point where it wouldn't be unexpected for me to just pass out.I had to take some emergency measures.I slowly reached into my inventory to take out a potion.\u300c Regeneration Potion \u300dAn item that heals small injuries when sprayed.I took off the top and poured the potion onto my head.Splash!\u201cAhhhhggggh!\u201dThe droplets of the potion dripping down my body left a trail of pain as they fell to the floor.I assumed it was effective because I was slowly gaining my senses back.All I need is to be able to move.I'll get out of the forest as soon as I absorb the spirits.\u201cAgggggghhhh\u2026\u2026\u201dI dragged my body like a zombie to the fog.I had to do this before I passed out\u2026.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the orc. \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the orc. \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the orc. \u300d\u300c Number of souls in possession \u2013 5/5 \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 42% \u300dI turned around as soon as I finished absorbing them.I could wait to convert them later.Voom!I collapsed into the blue portal that appeared where the chief once stood.\u300c Moving to the waiting room. \u300dI lost consciousness as a wave of relief flowed through my body.I woke up on the waiting room floor.I was still a bit dizzy when I woke up but I wasn't mentally or physically tired.I got up and examined my body.All the injuries and burns I got fighting the orcs had disappeared.But\u2026\u201cI can't use this shield anymore.\u201dThe shield I was holding was nothing more than a piece of junk now.It was broken and cracked beyond repair.There was no way it could block anything in this state.\u201cWas the impact of the last attack too much\u2026?\u201dThe shield may have been able to block the guard orcs' attacks, but it didn't stand a chance against the chief's magic.'At least it saved my life.'It did its job before breaking down.If I had taken that fireball directly, I might not be here right now.I returned what was left of the shield to the inventory and opened my mouth.\u201cTrial.\u201d\u300c Floor 3 trial starting in \u2013 23hrs 21min \u300d'Was I passed out for about an hour?'Not as long as I thought.I had pushed myself beyond my physical and mental limits, so it wasn't that surprising.\u201cAt least the waiting room is pretty effective.\u201dEven though my body's still feeling hot from the phantom pains\u2026I got off pretty easy if you think about it.If it was any more serious, I would have died without even absorbing the souls.'Ah, I did absorb those souls.'\u300c Number of souls in possession \u2013 5/5 \u300d\u201cWow, I didn't miss a single soul.\u201dI thought I would have missed at least one or two of them\u2026I guess I should give myself a little more credit.After checking out the souls, I caught up on all the other messages I missed.All the messages about the heat and pain resistance, as well as all the reward messages.I couldn't help but smirk looking at the list of rewards.I also had an insane amount of points.\u201cInventory.\u201dAn item I'd never seen was taking up the very first slot.\u300c Assassin's Cloak \u300d\u300c Grade: D \u300d\u300c Conceals all types of presence by -10% \u300d\u300c A cloak specially designed for the assassination guild. \u300d\u300c While agility is below 50, it increases by +5 \u300d\u300c While inserting mana, the user can increase their movement speed by 15% for 1 minute. \u300d\u300c The active ability can be used again after a 24-hour cooldown. \u300dI couldn't believe what I was seeing.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksEven at a glance, I could tell that it was overpowered.\u201cThese rewards are insane\u2026.\u201dIt gave me the assassination reward even though I didn't assassinate the chief.The default bonus was already amazing with the movement speed and presence erasure bonus.That's already good enough, but the active ability?\u300c While inserting mana, the user can increase their movement speed by 15% for 1 minute. \u300d\u201cThis is the craziest bonus.\u201dEven if the cooldown is a little long.That wasn't all though.\u300c Obsidian Dagger \u300d\u300c Grade: E+ \u300d\u300c Reaction speed +5% \u300d\u300c Attack speed +10% \u300d\u300c A dagger emitting dark mana, forged from black steel. \u300d\u300c It is approximately 60cm long and does not dull easily. \u300dIt's not as good as the cloak, but it's still something.It says it's a dagger, but it's long enough to be a one-handed sword.No complaints there though.It's the perfect weapon to be used in a variety of ways.I swung the blade a couple of times as practice.It was reminiscent of the night sky.Whoosh!I could hear the sharpness of the blade.Incomparable to the sword that I had received from the tutorial.The decision was an easy one.It was time to replace the tutorial sword.The tutorial sword didn't have a grade attached when I first got it, but the E+ Obsidian Dagger was clearly the higher-ranked weapon.The sword was also pretty rusted and dulled from all the blood.I'll just keep it in the inventory for now.'That should be it for all the equipment\u2026'It's time to check the skills now.\u300c Skill \u2013 Heat Resistance (F) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 5% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 All damage taken from flame attacks are reduced by 7% \u300dA heat resistance skill that I got from an achievement.\u300c Skill \u2013 Pain Resistance (D) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 4% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 Upon a strong enough impact, temporarily reduces all pain felt by 15% \u300dAnd the pain resistance I got as a bonus reward.They weren't bad but a little disappointing.\u201cI would have preferred a weapon or offensive skill but\u2026\u201dI'm using the little weapons knowledge I can scrape together, but there's a big difference between a weapons skill and whatever I'm doing.It's a bit underwhelming for something I risked my life for.'At least I got the cloak and the dagger.'Resistance skills aren't very cost efficient in the beginning.People say that they're basically useless until you raise the rank to D+.Of course, it might be different from person to person.'They don't rank up easily unless I hurt myself, so it's not very compatible with me.'I can only train it in a life-threatening situation.The only thing usable was the 'Pain Resistance.'Maybe it's because it was a bonus reward, but it's a D-rank skill.After a while, I started wondering.\u201cDid the others also pass?\u201dThere were hunters in the mix so I shouldn't be too worried\u2026I had had a thought in the midst of the 2nd trial.The goal of my trial was assassination.The trial would be cleared after killing the old orc chief.I might have thought it was easy if I didn't think about it too hard.But\u2014'The seemingly feeble chief turned out to be a magician.'What if I had entered his room without knowing?Magicians generally fortify their workshops.Assuming that his room was his workshop, he definitely had some sort of anti-intruder measures.That would have definitely ended badly for me.'It would have been more dangerous if I attacked in the middle of the night.'The orc hunters would have piled on and made the trial impossible.I only survived because I didn't attempt an assassination, but there was no guarantee that the others followed suit.I opened up the community to see how it went for others.\u300c You have entered the community. \u300d\u300c Difficulty \u2013 Hard \u300d\u300c Floor 3 Community (1977/2531) \u300dKim Seunghoon: Fuck, did they even make these possible?Hyun Sukjin: \u2026Did everyone really die? Seriously?Im Jinwook: Nah, there's a bunch of people still on the 2nd floor.Kim SeungHoon: What the fuck? Why was there a C-rank Monster on the second floor!Kang Sunwoo: I barely survived using my innate ability. God damnnn. Good thing my arm grew back.Kim Sihoon: The total number of people almost halved. A good chunk of us died.As predicted, the number of people in the community had halved.But the most important part came after.Hyun Sukjin: Wait yall had C-rank monsters? I only saw tons of goblins.Kim Seunghoon: I had a lich summon a crazy amount of skeletons. What goblins?Kim Sihoon: Huh? I just had to survive for 3 days from this orc tribe.Kang Sunwoo: I had to fight a bunch of orcs 1 on 1 in some colosseum.Lee Hayeon: Did everyone face a different trial?I guess everyone went through their own individual trials.But they all seemed to think it was unreasonably difficult.Well, I wasn't surprised to find any of these out.Kim Seunghoon: What was so great about me that they wanted me here\u2026Kang Sunwoo: I like how fast we're growing lol, but I was stronger irl though.Hyun Sukjin: idk man. I was a normal dude before this. I just wanna get back.Kim Seunghoon: It's gonna take sooo long for me to get back where I was before.Lee Changsuk: Sigh, is there even going to be a way for us to get back to Earth?Everyone in the community spiraled into discussing how to get back to earth.Of course, there's a way to find out.'You just have to ask the administrator.'I just didn't want to waste a question.But these people didn't seem to care anymore.Kang Sunwoo: Isn't it about time we use our questions?Kim Seunghoon: I think so. We should ask about returning to Earth and getting our powers back.Hyun Sukjin: Let's all share all the information we find here. I'll ask about returning to Earth.Kang Sunjin: Good idea. I'll ask about restoring our powers.Lee Changsuk: I'll ask about how the rewards are calculated within trials.I thought about joining in but I decided against it.'I'll just stay put.'Most people seemed to agree with me and took more of a bystander approach.It's a smart decision.You have more to lose from stepping up than gaining anything valuable.Hyun Sukjin: \u2026the administrator answered.Lee Changsuk: Really? What happened?Kim Seunghoon: Do we have to climb to the top of this tower?Kang Sunwoo: Sir, please. Share the news with us, good sir.The community was flooded with messages.Hyun Sukjin: There's a way to go back.And\u2014Hyun Sukjin: Here's how.A method to return to Earth started to appear in the community.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They wanted me to use another question so I stopped.Lee HaYeon: Then we can never go back to Earth permanently?Hyun Sukjin: No, I hear there's another item for that on the 8th floor.Kang Sunwoo: So there's no way to go back just yet then, damn.The chatting died down as everyone became somber.I saw this as a huge win though.\u201cSo there IS a way to get back\u2026.\u201dIt's all I'd wanted since I'd entered the tower.Same as everyone else.As long as you reach the 8th floor, you should be able to get back.But why is it that\u2014The news didn't make me that happy.Kang Sunwoo: Alright. It's my turn to spread some knowledge.More information started to pop up in the community.Kang Sunwoo: Basically, it's not possible to get your abilities back, but you can grow really quickly by climbing the tower.Lee Changsuk: Ah, I asked about how the rewards were calculated.Hyun Sukjin: Eyy let us have it!Lee Changsuk: So everyone gets their own individual trials and you get bonus rewards depending on how special your method of clearing was.Kim Seunghoon: That's simpler than I thought.Everyone started sharing what they found out left and right.They could be charging points for this\u2026Not a single person tried to sell anything though.They were all too preoccupied with the idea of returning home.Lee Hayeon: I just asked about the expansion and got a response.Lee Seungjin: Ohh that was fast. What did they say?Lee Hayeon: Starting from the 5th floor, they'll be selling more weapons as well as more items like the return stone.Lee Hayeon: And they'll even be selling skills starting on the 8th floor.Lee Seungjin: They're gonna sell skills\u2026.? I guess I shouldn't be surprised.Hyun Sukjin: Is that all the expansion is?Lee Hayeon: No, I think they're also adding a new system called the 'divergence.'What they called the 'divergence' was simple.The narrative-based trial.The battle-based trial.The strategy-based trial.On the 8th floor, you get to choose one of these divergences.Essentially, it would determine the way in which you'd climb the tower.Lee Hayeon: Once you choose a divergence, you'll get the relevant trial.If you chose the narrative-based trial, you'd play a role within a story.Battle-based trials would be mostly eradication or a raid.And the strategic trials would consist of challenges that could involve the other challengers, like capture the flag.I could picture how they'd all go besides the narrative trials.Hyun Sukjin: And even if you plan to leave on the 8th floor, we still don't know how expensive the item would be.Kang Sunwoo: Damn, I guess I gotta start saving.Park Chansuk: You might die if you're too cheap with it. Be careful.Kim Seunghoon: You might have to keep climbing the tower to save enough points.Lee Hayeon: Yeah. I wasn't able to find out anything else.Lee Jinwoo: I don't like the sound of having to go against the other challengers.Park Chansuk: They probably won't let the losing side survive.Lee Jinwoo: I don't even know why that's an option.From the looks of it\u2026The administrator didn't seem to want to give us the whole picture.'I should take this into account when I ask my questions.'There wasn't much more to get out of the community after that.Kim Donghyuk: I think I understand the divergence system now.Hyun Sukjin: I think we figured out as much as we could at this point.Kim Seunghoon: I guess everything else is up to us now.Lee Seungjin: Damn, the other difficulties probably already got out.Oh Choonsuk: lmao yeah we're the only ones still stuck here.I turned the community off when the conversations became irrelevant.\u201cWhy aren't I that happy about finding out that we can go home\u2026\u201dIf I could get back, I'd be a top-class hunter.Using my innate ability, I'd be able to go around dungeons absorbing souls to get stronger.'I can probably even become an A rank hunter.'But that didn't sit right with me.I guess human greed knows no bounds.This was the first time I'd been given the opportunity to grow.I wanted to get stronger.I wanted to climb higher.A smile escaped from the corner of my mouth.'Am I trying to kill myself?'I had to snap out of it.Slap!\u201cGet yourself together.\u201dI slapped my face to regain my composure.The 5th and 8th-floor challenges were a problem for the future.I might not even survive the 3rd floor.I had to focus.\u201cI'll think about those floors when I get to them.\u201dThe most important thing was staying alive.\u300c Han Sungyeun \u300d\u300c Strength \u2013 16 \u300d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u300c Stamina \u2013 11 \u300d\u300c Agility \u2013 11 \u300d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u300c Mana \u2013 8 \u300d\u300c Innate ability \u2013 'Necromancy(F) \u300d\u300c Skill \u2013 Accelerated Regeneration(E+), Heat Resistance(F), Pain Resistance(D) \u300d\u201cThis is more like it.\u201dIt was much better than the time from the tutorial where all the stats were below 10.But\u2026I didn't know if this would be enough for the higher floors.I needed to get stronger.\u300c Innate ability \u2013 'Necromancy(F) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 65% \u300d\u300c Basic effect \u2013 Able to absorb the souls of the dead and control them at will. \u300d\u300c Extra effect(1) \u2013 Able to permanently increase stats depending on the nature and rank of the soul. \u300d\u300c Extra effect(2) \u2013 Able to store souls for later use.

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10: Growth (3)I entered the third challenge as soon as the cooldown of the Assassin's Cloak was up.There was nothing more I could do to prepare.In order to survive and return to Earth, I had to do this now.\u300c Entering Tower of Trials floor 3. \u300d\u300c Difficulty \u2013 Hard \u300d\u300c The objective of the following trial is 'battle.' \u300d\u300c We wish the challenger a satisfactory ending to their choice. \u300dA wet atrium appeared as I stepped into the portal.It was a seemingly normal-looking cave with small puddles of water.A small hole in the ceiling let a glimmer of sunlight into the center of the cave.\u300c The 3rd-floor trial is starting soon. \u300d\u300c Trial success condition \u2013 Kill the sentinel of darkness\u300d\u300c Trial

at the message.I can't even begin to imagine what a sentinel of darkness is.There wasn't anything with that name in the hunter association's database.Another thing\u2014'I don't see anything that could be called a sentinel of darkness.'That meant\u2026'It could be hiding.'I held onto my shield tightly as I walked to the center of the cave.I didn't know where it would be coming out from.My guard had to be up at all times.Then\u2014\u300c The sentinel of darkness will spawn in 10 seconds. \u300dI stared blankly at the message.'I've seen this somewhere\u2026'I just remembered where I last saw the message.'The Tutorial Trial.'It seemed like that was forever ago.That meant the enemy hadn't spawned yet.That was more psychological pressure for me.It would be one thing if it was hiding but\u2026Now it'd be spawning someplace totally random.'This is much more precarious.'But there wasn't much I could do about this situation\u2026I kept my guard up and waited patiently for 10 seconds.\u300c The sentinel of darkness is spawning now. \u300dA shriek pierced my eardrums as the message popped up.Swaah!The sound of air shredding approached from the left.I twisted my body and put my shield up.Crang\u2026!The shock paralyzed my arm even through the shield.\u201cUgh!\u201dThe attack was strong enough to lure out a groan from me.I panicked for a second, but I got back into my stance.Then\u2014\u300c Defeat the doppelganger, sentinel of darkness. \u300dThe sentinel of darkness that the system was talking about finally showed itself.A dark shadowy figure wavered in the stream of sunlight.Shhhhh\u2026It was similar to a person.Like a black mass clumsily attempting to resemble a human.And the shield and the sword in its hand\u2026'Is it copying me\u2026?'The figure without eyes, nose, and a mouth creeped me out a little bit.This was the first time I was up against something I had no information on.'That means no other hunter has faced this monster before.'That alone made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.Going up against an unknown enemy was a big handicap.I lowered my body and hid it behind the shield.I would be at a disadvantage if I made the first move.But\u2014The doppelganger also stood in place.As if it was not a living being.Is it an intelligent monster?'That's not good.'Most monsters act purely based on instinct, but monsters above C-rank start to gain intelligence.\u201cThe second floor even had a magician\u2026\u201dIt really hit me that this was the hardest difficulty.After each trial, I could feel myself inching towards death.This must be what it's like to walk on a tightrope.\u201cKrr, krrrrr.\u201dThe doppelganger's dark facial area opened up and revealed a mouth.When its low pitched growl exposed the irregularly-placed fangs\u2014Whoosh!The doppelganger's right arm extended towards my face.The ability to close off distance without moving a step was frightening.I bent my torso backward in a hurry to have its arm graze over me.Crrrrrrrrr\u2014!The arm scraped the walls of the cave and the crash echoed throughout the cave.An absurd amount of strength.For a second there, I gazed out into the void.'A battle\u2026 I have to kill that monster\u2026?'It wasn't limited by range and was physically superior to me.This was completely different from the second trial.My strategy of isolating the stronger opponent wouldn't work here.One-on-one.A one-on-one with no strategy involved.My head filled with despair as I realized this was the only way to clear this trial.But\u2014Whoosh\u2026!I didn't get to revel in my feelings for too long before his arm shot at me again.The attack was too strong for me to block with my shield.I had to dodge this with a minimal amount of movement if I wanted to react to its next attack.I had to shake off my doubt and hesitation.I tilted my head to the side as I barely managed to dodge the attack.Chaaack!As the doppelganger's dagger darted past my face.Drip.My cheeks burned as I felt my blood drip down.I wiped the blood off my face and ran toward the monster.'I have to close the distance if I want any chance at winning\u2026!'At this rate, I'd tire out just trying to stay alive.If I could close the distance, its shapeshifting wouldn't be as useful.But\u2026The doppelganger seemed to welcome the close combat.I don't know why it willingly gave up its advantage, but this was my chance.Taking advantage of the distance, I took a jab at the doppelganger's heart.However, the doppelganger did not take this lightly.Kunng!\u201cKrr, krrrr.\u201dIt blocked my dagger using the shield in its left arm.This must be why it allowed me to get so close.But I expected this from a monster taking my form.I didn't hesitate to take another shot.Whoosh\u2026!I made a wide swing, forcing the monster to take a step back.I continued with a vertical slash.Clang!It blocked it again with the shield, but it didn't matter.The point of the attack wasn't to get a hit in.Bang!I kicked the doppelganger's leg while it was distracted by the dagger.Most monsters would lose their balance at this point\u2026Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe doppelganger's leg wavered but quickly regained its form.'What kind of bull\u2026'I aimed directly at the joint but that didn't even matter.I assumed that it might not be the most effective, but I didn't think physical attacks would be completely useless.This was just unexpected.Clang!After our short exchange, I gave myself some distance and stared at the doppelganger.Its abilities were crazy, but it was also starting to copy more clearly.'It even has the same stance as me now.'I guess it's not called a doppelganger for nothing.The longer this exchange went on, the stronger this doppelganger would get.'I'm already at a disadvantage.'The ability to transform and strengthen its body parts.And the intelligence to copy their opponent's techniques.It may have more abilities, but this was enough information.'If this drags on, I lose.'I had to finish this as fast as possible.I'd have to throw everything I could at it.I swung my dagger again as that fact settled into my brain.Clang!The doppelganger blocked it perfectly again.Seems like it finished learning my shield techniques.But\u2026Clang! Kang! Tang! Clang!I didn't stop and continued to swing my dagger.There had to be a limit to how much impact it could handle.If I could put continuous pressure on this guy, it could show an opening\u2026Tung!My theory soon proved itself correct.The shield fell back after countless slashes.I quickly stabbed it in the heart as soon as my chance came.A clean jab.Puashh!Muddy liquid poured out from the newly formed hole.The doppelganger stumbled back for a second but regained its stance.It seemed a little shocked but not to the extent where its life was in danger.The hole in the doppelganger closed itself already.It didn't seem completely useless though.The doppelganger definitely felt threatened by me now.That means the dagger was effective.And\u2014'It's not immune to all physical attacks.'As long as my attack was strong enough to get past its defenses.An attack to the neck or the head might be able to kill it.Of course, it didn't react as well as I wanted to the attack in the heart\u2026But the neck and head are different.'Not many monsters are unphased by decapitation.'A doppelganger shouldn't be an exception.That's good enough for me to give it a try.'I need an opportunity to get one good attack in.'That meant I'd have to use everything I had.Concentrating on the energy in my stomach, I spread the mana into my body.I moved my mana with ease, just like I practiced in the waiting area.In the past, doing this took all my energy and concentration.Mana's my lowest stat after all.But now\u2026\u300c Using the Assassin's Cloak(C)'s active ability. \u300d\u300c Movement speed +15% \u300d\u300c Activation time left \u2013 00:00:59 \u300dIt wasn't as exhausting after my mana stat increased.Just the feeling of something leaving my body.'It takes a bit out of me\u2026 but nothing unbearable.'This could shift the tides back in my favor.I moved some mana into the cloak and started moving.Koong!I lightly pushed off my foot and my surroundings dashed past me.An agility over 30 with a 15% boost.A little out of balance.I barely managed to regain my balance while zooming through the air.This was only possible through the fruits of my training.'I just have to do it like I did it in the waiting area\u2026!'I focused all my attention on the tips of my toes and held my shield up instead of the dagger.I wasn't arrogant enough to aim directly at its neck.Although if I was used to this speed, I would have tried to slice his neck open.Not only was I not used to this speed, but it was also holding a shield.Not to mention that it stole all of my shield techniques.So\u2026This is the best I can do for now.Crannng!When the impact from the crash hit me.Piiiiii\u2026An unfamiliar ringing noise filled my ears and shook my brain up.But I didn't even have time to scream.Crash!My entire body shook and my vision phased in and out.The recoil was so much worse than I thought.\u201cUughhh\u2026!\u201dMy vision was blurry and my head was killing me.I couldn't move my body either.\u300c The skill 'Pain Resistance' is activating. \u300d\u300c All pain induced to the user is reduced by 15%. \u300dThis skill was the only reason I was still conscious.'Damn it, what's wrong with me\u2026!'I propped myself up on the cold gravel.Shudder\u2026My arms were shaking and blood was dripping down to the floor.I must have hit something when I crashed.I was too dizzy to even tell where the blood was coming from.The pain seemed to be coming from everywhere.But it didn't matter.\u300c The skill 'Accelerated Regeneration' is activating. \u300dThe skill activated and I started to gain some clarity back.Although, it felt like time was passing extra slowly.This should have left an impact on the doppelganger.The chances are, it was also debilitated now like me.I hobbled my way up to look around.Then\u2014\u201cThis crazy son of a\u2026\u201dI saw the doppelganger trembling in the corner of the cave.Looking at its formless legs and arms, it took a good beating.Even that seemed to be repaired now though.It was at least still struggling to move around at the moment.I didn't have a moment to lose.I gripped my shield and dagger and ran towards the monster.It was recovering pretty fast but\u2026I was confident that I could decapitate it before that.\u300c Activation time left \u2013 00:00:27 \u300dI still had some time on my buff left.\u300c Deadwood Shield(D)'s effect is activating. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 2 temporarily. \u300d\u300c Attack speed slightly increased temporarily. \u300d'Nice timing\u2026!'Spending all those points on the shield ended up being worth it.Strength flowed through my body, as opposed to the barely alive doppelganger.It was now or never.Craaaaack-!When I shoved the dagger into the doppelganger's neck.\u300c Congratulations, you have cleared the 3rd floor. \u300dFinally.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Badum.The fact that I fought and achieved something\u2026Was that something that could make my heart beat this fast?'No way.'This wasn't something that a normal person would feel.How could you be excited after you've almost died?This was different from being relieved that you survived.But\u2026Just knowing that fact didn't make me any more normal.Maybe it's because the last 7 years of my life have been so stagnant.Or was I this crazy from the start?Either way\u2026This tower isn't good news for me.It tests me to my limit and provides a fair reward.Unlike real life where my hard work amounted to nothing.\u201cMaybe that's also just an excuse.\u201dNo matter the reason, it was clear that I was abnormal.But that was also one of the reasons that I survived.I couldn't deny that.Those who were able to adapt survived and those who couldn't\u2026 died.'That's why the community members go down every floor.'From that perspective, that wasn't too bad.I'd completely adapted to this new way of life.But I heard hunters in my situation were in the most danger.It's easier to get addicted to the thrill of battle and go mad.I heard this was more severe for people with growth-type innate abilities.Then was it wrong to feel these feelings?I didn't know.It was probably a good thing for now but\u2026Everything would change on the 5th floor.There was a possibility of going back to Earth after that.But for now.\u201cLet's just focus on staying alive.\u201dThat was more than enough to keep me busy for now.I lifted myself up and walked toward the doppelganger.I stuck my hands into the black mist.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the doppelganger. \u300d\u300c Number of souls in possession \u2013 1/5 \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 35% \u300dMy surprise at the proficiency increase didn't last too long.\u300c Innate ability 'Necromancy's' proficiency reached 100%. \u300d\u300c Innate ability 'Necromancy's' ranked up. \u300dI really didn't expect that to happen.'It's going to rank up this suddenly?'All I could do was stare blankly.I didn't understand why the proficiency increased by so much and the skill ranked up.But\u2026I had a feeling why.'Maybe there's a hidden bonus depending on the soul that I absorb.'Like maybe the proficiency increases more if it's stronger than me.I'd heard some skills that worked like that.The system was concise and didn't always explain everything.Of course, this wasn't a bad thing for me\u2026\u201c\u2026I guess I just got lucky this time.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThat was the only possible explanation.It seemed like my innate ability had pretty high potential.This skill was probably one of the higher-tier growth skills.'I get stronger the more enemies I fight and the proficiency explodes depending on some conditions.'A dry laugh escaped my mouth as I opened my status window.\u300c Innate ability \u2013 'Necromancy (E) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Basic effect \u2013 Able to absorb the souls of the dead and control them at will. \u300d\u300c Extra effect(1) \u2013 Able to permanently increase stats depending on the nature and rank of the soul. \u300d\u300c Extra effect(2) \u2013 Able to store souls for later use.

That's too much.'No one's ever heard of something like that.There were also no prerequisites to absorbing skills.'It's like, if the tower was high risk, high return\u2026'Necromancy was low risk, high return.There wasn't much to worry about, but the rewards were comparable to those of the tower.Even if there were some unseen conditions, this was still a winning deal for me.\u201cI never thought I'd end up with an innate ability like this.\u201dI was different from the past where I couldn't get any of my stats to increase.All I had to do was fight strong enemies.'Well, they don't necessarily have to be strong.'I could just massacre a bunch of weaker enemies to get stronger too.\u201cNo wonder why everyone said that your innate ability was the most important.\u201dIf you ended up with a good one, the value couldn't be measured in money.I somehow ended up in that group.'Couldn't this have happened a little sooner?'It was making me go through literal hell before giving me this overpowered ability.No use lamenting the past now.I was a little salty but moved my attention to the other rewards.\u300c Skill \u2013 Hunter's Daggermanship (E) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Explanation \u2013 A technique made by hunters for effective hunting. \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 When using a dagger, the weapon's cutting force is increased by 1.5 times. \u300dI would have preferred a rarer dagger skill but I shouldn't be too greedy.Hunter's Daggermanship.I knew it pretty well.There was a time when I would have killed for this skill.'My untalented ass wasn't able to get it anyway.'I did end up being able to learn how to use the weapons though.It was one of the skills that were relatively easy to learn and one of the most effective.'I mean the effect is nice and I wanted a weapon skill but\u2026 why this one?'I thought the Tower of Trials would give a different variety of weapon skills.But come to think of it, it made sense thinking about the comments I saw in the community.\u201cThey said the way you cleared the trial was important to the bonus rewards.\u201dThis was a reflection of how I fought during the trial.'I did use the dagger during the whole trial.'I guess it made sense that this was the skill that I got.I also checked the new item in my inventory.\u300c Elixir of Steel \u300d\u300c Grade: C \u300d\u300c An elixir that an alchemist poured their soul into. ]\u300c Creates a special stat 'Tenacity.'

How am I supposed to get to the 8th floor with this difficulty?Complaints burst out as soon as I opened the community.It makes sense though.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe 3rd trial was crazy difficult.'The 2nd floor wasn't too bad as long as you knew how to use your head\u2026 but not the 3rd floor.'But the mood in the community wasn't as bad as I thought.Lee Yongjin: Back in my day, we just stuck through it no matter how hard it was.Hyun Sukjin: I can smell your dentures from all the way here.Kim Seunghoon: Lmao yall crazy.It seems that only the more experienced people were left at this point.People were even sharing some tips.Kim Seunghoon: I don't recommend buying any items that require mana unless you have a mana related skill.Oh Choonsuk: Isn't mana the most important thing for a hunter? You need it to use skills right?Kim Seunghoon: That's what the noobies think. The most efficient basic skills like weapons skills don't use mana.Oh Choonsuk: I already bought a mana item\u2026 Am I screwed?Kim Seunghoon: Nah, you're good. Just focus on getting stat-related items now.Kang Sunwoo: I'm a hunter and what he's saying is correct. They say that you can buy skills later so you can just get a mana skill then.Lee Hayeon: And if you want to get your old skills back faster, train after turning the auto-healing in the waiting area off.A lot more tips came up afterward.Of course, I already know most of it so I didn't have to focus as much, but I still learned some good stuff.'Skill proficiency goes up after I turn off the auto-healing?'Same with acquiring new skills.There was a lot of interesting information.Hyun Sukjin: Oh yeah. There's a way to get skills besides trial rewards and training.Kim Seunghoon: You mean the ones that the tower gives you?Hyun Sukjin: Oh, you already know about it?Kim Seunghoon: Yeah. I think it's called an achievement.Lee Hayeon: Yeah, those things are great. I already got 2 from that.Hyun Sukjin: Damn\u2026 I just took od hits and it gave me a single resistance skill.Kim Seunghoon: Resistance skills get op after a while so make sure you train it.I was wondering what the heat resistance was about.'I guess it's built into the system.'A system that rewarded you for achieving something.There wasn't any detailed information but I still learned a decent amount.Even after 3 trials, the tower still managed to surprise me.Kim Seungjoon: There's something I want to say about the 4th trial.Kim Seungjoon: The 4th trial isn't individual like the others but some sort of group challenge.Oh Choonsuk: A group trial? What's that? Some sort of special trial?Kim Seungjoon: Everyone here would be fanning the same trial.Oh Choonsuk: \u2026 Am I the only one who doesn't understand?Kim Seunghoon: I don't understand either. Pls explain.As soon as one person mentioned the 4th trial, the community couldn't stop thinking about it.Kim Seungjoon: I found out some information about the 4th trial using my questions.This is what he said:He'd been using his questions to find out information about every upcoming trial.And as always, he asked the administrator about the 4th trial.Kim Seungjoon: According to the admin, the 4th trial is a group trial.Basically, all the challengers on the 4th floor would be going through the trial together.Kim Seungjoon: 30 people will be grouped together and placed in the same trial.Something unthinkable to the challengers.There was no collaboration whatsoever until now\u2026But the 4th trial would be different.Kim Seungjoon: That's why I'm telling everyone.Oh Choonsuk: My good deeds have come back to reward me.Kim Seunghoon: Shut up for a second.Lee Hayeon: It's still interesting to know that we'll be facing the next trial together.Han Jinyong: But that could mean it will be 30 times harder to clear\u2026 Fuck.Some people speculated that difficulty would spike because of all the people, while others said that collaboration would make the trials a little easier.Kim Seungjoon: This probably won't be a trial where we collaborate though.Kim Seungjoon: The objective of this trial is 'competition' so we might have to fight each other.The trial was definitely pitting us against each other.I didn't know if this would be an outright battle royale but\u2026Whether or not the trial made us kill each other or not, anyone who lost would be killed by the penalty anyway.We'd be fighting each other, even if it was just to stay alive.Kim Seungjoon: I didn't get all the details but here's what I know.We'd be put into teams of 3 and work towards a common objective.The teams would be formed randomly by the tower.Kim Seungjoon: I couldn't figure out anything more since I ran out of questions.Kim Seungjoon: If anyone has more information please share it.But people stopped talking after that.I didn't know who would use their questions to find out any additional information but\u2026'There's no way someone would share that information like before.'Everyone must have figured out the situation by now.I didn't know why the initial challenger even told us what he knew.Did he not realize what this information would do to the community?'No way.'Still, there was no point in deliberating on why he told us.It didn't seem like a lie but there's no way to tell.'If it's true, we'd have to fight each other\u2026 like it or not.'This was different from all the other trials where you had to kill monsters.The gravity of having to commit murder weighed down on the community.The losers would die and the winners would move on to the next floor.I stared at the frozen chat screen and got lost in my thoughts.Could I really kill someone for my own benefit?'I don't know\u2026'But that didn't mean I'd lay down and let them walk all over me.In the end, I'd have to act to save my own life.So\u2026I knew what I had to do to survive.I had to review my rewards and prepare for the upcoming fight.Nothing had changed.I had to prepare for and overcome the next trial.That was all.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Shall we introduce ourselves?\u201dIn fact, she took a look around and suggested that we exchange pleasantries.She seemed overly calm but that eliminated a need for small talk.\u201cI'm Han Sungyoon. Nice to meet you.\u201dThe woman flipped her hair back and replied.\u201cI'm Lee Hayeon. Likewise.\u201dAn eye-catching, cool beauty.'Just one left.'The large man opened his mouth, almost reluctantly.\u201c\u2026I'm Lee Sunghoon. Don't get in my way and we won't have any problems.\u201dDon't get in his way?It was an interesting introduction but we quickly switched the topic.\u201cFirstly, did anyone look up any information about the trial?\u201dLee Hayeon replied calmly to Sunghoon's question.\u201cYeah, I used my questions to find out some extra information.\u201d\u201cGood. What did you find out?\u201d\u201c\u2026I used quite a few questions so I should know all the basics.\u201d\u201cHm, I guess I didn't completely lose the teammate lottery.\u201dI felt similarly.That Lee Sunghoon guy seemed a little arrogant but didn't seem like a bad guy.These kinds of people are usually the strongest.It would be a pain in my ass if he was a permanent teammate but\u2026'I can take this for a trial.'Our paths would diverge after we cleared this trial.\u201cLet's reveal our abilities before getting started.\u201dLee Sunghoon wanted to skip the small talk and discuss our abilities.That seemed like a given for people who need to work together.Lee Hayeon seemed a little hesitant but opened up.\u201cI have an exploration-based innate ability and I can use magic. I'm not fit for close-range combat.\u201dLee Sunghoon's eyes gleamed when he heard magic.He seemed a little dim, but even he knew how valuable mages were.\u201cOh, a mage. What kind of magic can you use?\u201d\u201cNothing offensive. I specialize in support magic.\u201dA mage who couldn't use offensive spells\u2026After hearing that, I finally opened my mouth.\u201cBut you can use at least one offensive magic right?\u201dEven support mages should be able to use at least one attack spell.Although she probably wasn't lying about close combat due to her lack of weapons\u2026There was no way she got up the tower without any offense.Although I couldn't say anything if she just said all her trials were some supporting ones\u2026She didn't look like she had any other way of fighting other than magic.Lee Hayeon's eyes widened for a second and she admitted it.\u201c\u2026It's not much but I can also use some elemental magic.\u201dI could tell she was considering hiding it for a bit but she gave in.I understood why she wanted to hide it though.'She probably thought that she might need to use a hidden skill in the worst-case scenario.'The failure condition is the death of the entire team after all.That meant as long as you were alive, what happened to your team didn't matter.That also meant you couldn't do anything to them as long as they stayed alive.'There's a decent number of loopholes if you want to abuse it.'She probably wanted to keep at least one thing hidden just in case.After all, anything could happen in the tower.\u201cYou said you're a mage, but you're probably more fit in a supporter role.\u201d\u2026Lee Sunghoon didn't seem that interested in any of that.I also thought about what I should reveal before speaking up.\u201cI specialize in close combat and I have physical-enhancement-based innate ability.\u201dJust enough for them to work with me.I also wasn't lying about anything because my innate ability actually does strengthen my body.They didn't seem to doubt it because it matched my appearance.\u201cWhat a coincidence. I'm also a close combat specialist with a mana resistance innate ability.\u201d\u201cResistance\u2026 That's a pretty high quality innate ability.\u201d\u201cIt's on a different level from the mid-level losers\u201dHe smirked as he talked about himself.I guess I knew where his arrogance came from.'It's because he has an innate ability like mana resistance.'Mana resistance could help you resist all things involving mana like magic or manbased skills.It synergized very well with those specializing in close combat.\u201cWe should also reveal what our hunter ranks were in the outside world.\u201dHe slipped that in as the corner of his mouth rose.\u201cI was a D rank hunter before I came here.\u201d\u201cThat's probably a good idea. I was an E rank.\u201d\u201cNot bad for a support. You must have been alright.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cI must have been.\u201dWhile Lee Hayeon brushed Sunghoon off, his attention now turned to me.I didn't even have a rank to reveal to them.Just 7 fruitless years as a trainee.\u201cI wasn't a hunter in the outside world, but I was a player. I was preparing to become a hunter.\u201dOf course, I didn't mention that the preparation period was 7 years.\u201cLegit?\u201dAs expected, his face contorted into a look of disapproval.\u201cI'm still confident enough in my ability to fight.\u201dBut he didn't even try to hear me out.\u201cConfident my ass. Just don't hold us back.\u201dHe looked like he just lost a lottery.A familiar gaze.The only reaction I got before coming into the tower.\u201cI guess you can at least be a meat shield if you can strengthen your body.\u201dJust his tone said that he didn't expect anything from me.I stayed quiet and stared at him.He must have taken my silence as acceptance.\u201cJust stay in front of Lee Hayeon and follow my orders if you want to pass the trial.\u201dLee Hayeon carefully opened her mouth.\u201cWell if he came up here, we're all probably at the same power level.\u201dIt was almost as if she was trying to calm me down, but I had no intention of replying.All that mattered in this tower was your strength.If he was qualified to talk to me like that, I had nothing to say.My pride was a small price to pay for my life.If he could prove his strength, it would be best to just play along with him\u2026Though if he couldn't, there was no reason for me to be treated like this.'I'll find out soon enough.'\u300c The citadel's front door will open in 3 minutes. \u300dThe trial would officially start soon.And\u2014\u201cLet's hear the information you found out using your questions.\u201dAn eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.No point in talking back to him now.I wouldn't let him talk his way out if he ever got in the way or caused a problem.Even if he was a hunter in the past, if we were all reset at the beginning\u2026'We shouldn't be too far off in strength.'Some of the rewards and our innate abilities were probably a little different.But even then, we should all be around the same level\u2026More so since I found out how overpowered my innate ability was.\u201cLet me tell you what's going to happen after the doors open.\u201dIt wasn't like anything that we haven't faced before.We'd be fighting monsters off, same as usual.Also, we'd have to get through the horde as fast as possible and kill the goblin chief.\u201cIn these citadels, there are a total of 5 bosses and only 15 people can pass the trial.\u201dOnly half of the 30 would survive.\u201cEach boss is targeted by two teams so we have a team against us.\u201dThat's not bad, there were only 3 people against us\u2026'Six people going for the same objective.'It was designed to be cruel.We would practically be murdering our opponents.Actually, they were essentially ordering us to take out the other team.Taking out the boss would be much easier if we took out the other team first.But Lee Sunghoon seemed to prefer it.\u201cI like how simple it is. We just have to kill it before they do.\u201d\u201cWe'll have to map the area out first.\u201d\u201cDidn't you say you had an exploration-based innate ability?\u201d\u201cYep. I'll lead the way so the two of you can just protect me.\u201d\u201cYou hear that trainee? Just stand in front of her.\u201dI just nodded my head.He definitely didn't like the fact that I didn't say anything, but he didn't point it out.More accurately, he didn't have the chance.\u300c Time up. \u300d\u300c The citadel gates have opened and the monsters are pouring in. \u300d\u300c Find the target as soon as possible and kill it. \u300d\u201cStand in the front.\u201dLee Sunghoon dropped the conversation and took out his greatsword.I nodded again and stood in front of Lee Hayeon.\u201cPlease just tell me where to go.\u201d\u201cI'll be in your care.\u201dShe followed close behind and Lee Sunghoon guarded us from the rear.As soon as we stepped out\u2026KIEAAAKK!We only just started and this happened already?Monsters made their way through the stone buildings.Seeing an army of fully armed goblins made the hair on the back of my neck stand up.Yep. No way the tower would have made this easy.\u201c\u2026I can lead the way later. Let's get ready to fight first.\u201dI remembered that I didn't choose to go on a walk in the park\u2026This was the worst of the three difficulties\u2026 hard.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Go fight you degenerate!\u201dHearing him yell without even looking up, I could only sigh at his incompetence.He was genuinely having a hard time with the goblins.I expected all of us to have a similar strength level.My innate ability was growth-based and I did get a lot of bonus rewards\u2026But we all cleared the same trials at the same difficulty, so I assumed that they had something similar.Yet reality wasn't all like it seemed.Lee Sunghoon wasn't even at my level, let alone stronger than me.'I know they're fully armed, but they're still just goblins\u2026'I wasn't even sure how they made it up all the way here.At this point, Lee Hayeon let out a strained squeak.\u201cIf you can last a little longer, my spell will be\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up and use a buff or something! Right now!\u201dHe must have felt frustrated that he was just hiding behind his sword.I didn't think any buff was going to be enough to make him useful.I was flabbergasted but I knew the solution to this.In the end, I'd have to be the one to handle these goblins.Of course, I could just stay put and let Lee Hayeon handle it in a bit.'That would be the safest option.'Protect her cast while she casts buffs on Lee Sunghoon.Upholding this system should be enough to take all these goblins out\u2026But this trial had a time limit.'And since we have competition, the faster the better.'We could all end up dying if we got held up for too long in the beginning.We would essentially be asking for them to kill us.Then there was only one problem left.'Can I take care of them before they touch Lee Hayeon?'I considered it for a bit but came to a swift conclusion.\u201cExcuse me.\u201dEven being generous, these goblins were barely as strong as the hunter orcs.I was at least pretty confident that I could take the attention off of Lee Hayeon.\u201cHuh? What are you\u2026\u201dShe had a confused look on her face but I decided to ignore it.I had no intention of explaining myself to her anyway.Kwong!More importantly, I pushed off the ground and hurled myself where the goblins were concentrated.The distance between myself and the goblins closed quickly and.Shuat!The frontmost goblin's head flew in the air, spraying blood everywhere.The agility stat I'd been absorbing was finally starting to shine.Goblins that noticed me started to shoot their darts at me in a panic.Needless to say, they were all blocked by my shield.The constant darts were annoying but it wasn't much to deal with.I just had to see the trajectory of the dart and put my shield up.It wasn't even that hard.Anyone could do it if they had high enough stats.Tu-tu-tung!I slapped away more darts as I swung my sword.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe Hunter's Daggermanship skill made my movements more fluid and sharp.It was almost like I could see the path that my blade should take.All the theories I knew about dagger techniques were happening in front of me in real-time.That alone already made the skill worth it.The goblins tried to resist it by holding up their arm guards.They must use those to halt the blades and use that opportunity to dig into their opponents.'Maybe not for blunt weapon users but they were tough for blade wielders.'That still didn't stop the swing of my blade.The guard would normally stop any sharp weapon, but my dagger was a ranked item with the hunter's daggermanship skill.I could tell that the small piece of steel wouldn't be enough to impede my dagger with 1.5 times the cutting force.My conviction turned into reality.Slit\u2014!With no resistance, I sliced through both the guard and its arm like butter.Pit!I shoved my dagger into the armless goblin's neck and headed toward the others.Snip! Pit! Puaat!Goblin blood spurted at all angles with each swing of my arm.They would at least need some decent equipment if they wanted to stand a chance against me.Thankfully they emphasized quantity over quality.Just as I killed four more goblins\u2014\u300c 'Goblin Slayer' achievement unlocked. \u300dA message appeared in the corner of my eye and lightened my body.This was the same system that gave me the heat resistance skill on the 2nd floor.\u300c Agility increased by 1. \u300dIt didn't give me a skill like last time but it was still useful.There was no need to even track the poison darts and the weapons anymore.The goblins couldn't keep up with my newly gained agility.I was now taking these goblin's lives in an instant.Pit!After about 8 goblins, they stopped coming at me.The battle was over.'This should be the end of the wave.'I caught my breath and observed my surroundings.I don't know when, but Lee Sunghoon also took care of two goblins.Of course, that was with the help of Lee Hayeon's buffs.Something was off about the mood.Lee Sunghoon's face was frozen solid and Lee Hayeon was staring at me with wide eyes.Snapping awake, Lee Sunghoon spoke first.\u201cN-not bad for a trainee. You must have gotten lucky, only facing the weak goblins.\u201dI couldn't even begin to comprehend what he was saying for a second.Standing behind him, Lee Hayeon scowled.\u201c\u2026That doesn't seem right. It wasn't just luck.\u201dLee Hayeon reluctantly spoke up but Lee Sunghoon didn't back down.\u201cIt's not my fault he picked out the weaker one to fight.\u201d\u201cIt was clearly all skill. I don't think you should talk about him like that.\u201dLee Sunghoon eyed me from the side before opening his mouth again.\u201cWhat do you mean skill? It was just beginner's luck.\u201d'Beginner's luck' huh.Now I knew why he was staring at me so weirdly.Unlike him, who could barely fend off two, I killed eight.His pride must have been hurt.These kinds of people always act like this when they get hit in the face with reality.All the 'talented' trainees reacted like this when they became hunters.They tried to bring down others to preserve their worth.I would have shrugged it off if this was the outside world.A 7-year trainee like me had no right to speak up\u2026But not anymore.\u201cStop with all this luck and weak bullshit.\u201dIf he was acting like this even after seeing the difference in our skill, I'd give him exactly what he wanted.If he wants a hierarchy, he'd get a hierarchy.\u201cW-what did you sa\u2014!\u201dHe tried to respond with a red face but I was faster.\u201cWhatever you were blubbering about, shut the fuck up.\u201d\u201cBlubbering, when did I ever\u2026\u201d\u201cTelling me to be a meat shield because I was a trainee, getting lucky and facing weak goblins.\u201d\u201cI think I've been patient enough with you.\u201dHonestly, that was the straw that broke the camel's back.\u201cIsn't it laughable that we're in a life or death trial and here you are arguing with me?\u201d\u201cWe barely have a day left and our competition is probably making their way to the boss as we speak.\u201dLee Sunghoon's face darken when I mentioned the wasted time.He must have felt at least a little guilty about it.\u201cIf you plan on being a dead weight, the least you can do is shut up.\u201dI stomped towards him.\u201cWe don't fail if at least one person in the team stays alive.\u201dIn other words, I was willing to kill him if he got in my way.Of course, I didn't really plan on killing anyone, so it was more of a bluff.The threat seemed to work wonders on Lee Sunghoon.\u201cW-wha\u2026\u201d\u201cVoice your complaints now if you have any.\u201dHe flinched and stumbled back.\u201cI'm glad you don't have any problems.\u201dI might've been going too far, but at least now he wouldn't look down on me.I looked him straight in the eye and made my final remarks.\u201cHopefully we can work well together for the rest of the trial.\u201dIt wasn't like he had a choice though.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You're just a trainee\u2026!'Contrary to his internal turmoil, Lee Sunghoon couldn't act on anything.It was obvious.Unlike him, who struggled to deal with just 2 goblins, the man in front of him killed 8.All without getting any support from Lee Hayeon in the back.It crushed them with pure physical superiority.Those armed goblins were at least E-ranked and at most D-ranked.This man just told him that he'd kill him before finishing the trial unless he faced reality.\u201cHopefully we can work well together for the rest of the trial.\u201dLee Sunghoon may not be the sharpest tool in the shed but he wasn't an idiot.The more stubborn he was, the more he stood to lose.He also couldn't ask Lee Hayeon for any help.She wasn't really on anyone's side.Lee Hayeon was currently standing back and just looking at the two men back and forth.It was clear that her non-partisan stance wouldn't play favorably to Lee Sunghoon.Lee Sunghoon wouldn't waste their time any longer.He closed his mouth and stayed back.'Well, he probably didn't have much to say against that.'That was the only reason I didn't talk back to him in the beginning.I thought he might act out if he had a big enough ego but\u2026'I'm glad he's not that stupid.'In a timed trial, more conflict meant more time wasted.Especially if that trial had your life on the line.He probably also realized that this was a waste of time when he backed off.It also wouldn't make any logical sense for him to stand up against me after seeing our differences.Now that I was the unofficial leader of the team, it was time to put it to use.\u201cI'll go out and take care of the monsters, so just protect Lee Hayeon.\u201dHe reluctantly opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026Okay. Anything else?\u201dHe had a disrespectful tone as if it was his ego's final stand.It didn't matter though.I'd probably never see him again after this trial.\u201cThat's it. It shouldn't be too hard. And Miss Lee Hayeon\u2026\u201d\u201cYou don't have to be so formal.\u201d\u201cAlright. All you have to do is tell us where to go and support us from the back.\u201d\u201cOkay. I'll resume examining the area.\u201dHmm, I didn't expect Lee Hayeon to be nervous as well.It might be the fact that I just threatened to kill Lee Sunghoon.Well, they're probably only cooperating because I didn't actually kill him.They were at least warier of me now.'I didn't mean to be so forceful.'It left a bitter aftertaste in my mouth.Although I didn't regret anything I did.If I kept dealing with his shit, it would have gotten out of hand fast.We didn't know where the other team was, but they probably weren't having as much trouble as Lee Sunghoon.We would have been at a disadvantage if I left him in charge.At this point, Lee Hayeon raised her hand in a direction and spoke softly.\u201cI just used my ability and I think the boss is near the center of the city.\u201d\u201c\u2026You already found out where the boss is?\u201d\u201cI think so. The goblin king is currently at the center of the citadel. As are all of the other bosses.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cDo you think we could cross paths with any of the teams going for other bosses?\u201d\u201cHm, the bosses are all far enough apart that that shouldn't happen.\u201dThat meant any other challengers we see would be the competing team.The tower always gave the trials and rewards in the most intuitive way, and this wasn't an exception.'They want you to kill all monsters and challengers you run into.'So simple even Lee Sunghoon could understand it.\u201cCan you figure out where the other challengers are?\u201d\u201cMy innate ability isn't developed enough to detect other people. I also don't have enough mana for it.\u201d\u201cThen it wouldn't be possible to avoid them on our way to the goblin king.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 At least with my ability\u201dLee Hayeon's face darkened as she started to realize that murder was unavoidable.Lee Sunghoon didn't seem any more nervous than he already was.It wasn't a normal response.I didn't know what he did before he came to the tower, but he might have had some experience with manslaughter.There have been reports that some dungeon feuds end up in death.The law couldn't do anything about whatever happened in the dungeon.If I was correct, I had to stay wary of him.'He might stab me in the back.'On the other hand, there was little to no chance that Lee Hayeon would turn against me.She didn't have much combat potential and didn't seem to like Sunghoon very much.She wouldn't betray me if she wanted to stay alive.\u300c The inner city monsters have started mobilizing. \u300d\u300c Please kill the trial's target quickly. \u300dThe system seemed to tell us that it wouldn't wait any longer.It was time to act.I wanted to avoid murder to the best of my ability, but I wasn't counting on it.If it came to it, I would have to kill with my own two hands.\u201cLet's get moving then.\u201dBut there were some things I had to take care of.\u201cLet's get in formation and\u2026?\u201dLee Hayeon stared at me in confusion while I was in mid-sentence.Understandable.People normally don't walk up to goblin corpses.\u201cUh, if you're trying to collect their cores, you won't be able to find any in the tower's monsters.\u201dShe informed me while still looking puzzled.It wasn't something I knew but I wasn't looking to find their cores.If I can't leave the tower, the cores wouldn't be particularly useful anyway.\u201cGive me a second. There's something I gotta do.\u201d\u300c You have absorbed the souls of the goblin rangers. \u300d\u300c Number of souls in possession \u2013 8/15 \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 11% \u300dPretending to scalp the knives from the corpses, I absorbed all their souls.I wasn't able to absorb the two that Lee Sunghoon killed but\u2026'It would be stranger if I could absorb the souls of the monsters that I didn't kill.'I guess that's just how it was.\u300c Acquiring one of the goblin ranger's skills. \u300d\u300c Permanently increasing your stats using the soul. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 3. \u300d\u300c Agility increased by 4. \u300d\u300c Stamina increased by 2. \u300d\u300c Tenacity increased by 7. \u300d'The skill absorption seems to work pretty well when there are multiple monsters.'\u300c Acquiring 'Ranger's Knowledge (F)' \u300dIt didn't strike me as something too useful but\u2026A skill's a skill.It should be useful, no matter how low the rank was.\u300c Skill \u2013 Ranger's Knowledge (F) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 Gain a greater perception and more easily notice those who approach you. \u300dIt was a simple skill, but it had a lot of uses.I didn't know what it meant to notice those who approach me, but I could definitely see the difference in my perception.'Is this what it means to have a greater perception?'All the objects in my line of sight were clear and in focus.Good thing it wasn't one of those skills that required some time to get used to.I picked up the backup knife one of the goblins had on their waist and handed it to Lee Hayeon.\u201cTake this. The quality isn't all that great but you can at least use it as a throwing knife.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026 Thank you, but it would probably be more useful in your hands. I'm not very good at throwing anything.\u201d\u201cNo, I can't throw either. Plus, I have no need for it. You might need it while you're fighting next to Lee Sunghoon.\u201dI was essentially telling her to hold on to it in case she needed to protect herself.She didn't resist any further and took the knife.\u201c\u2026Thank you. I'll try my best to make use of it.\u201d\u201cIt's nothing. It's not even mine.\u201dWell, technically I won it in battle, but it's better to keep it like this.A supporting mage was an important position.If she died, things would no doubt get worse.Plus, she tried to help me with Lee Sunghoon a moment ago.Besides, I could always just use the knife I bought from the store if I needed to.\u201cWell let's get going.\u201dIt was time to finish the trial.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The trial will go on soon.\u201dShe had a dark look on her face for some reason but I didn't want to say anything here.The contents of the conversation may irritate Lee Sunghoon.I mean, by the looks of it, it probably seemed like I was going to rob her\u2026'I'll just explain it when we get in there.'I wasn't going to do something like that to a teammate who was pulling their weight.At least, not to a normal person.Hm\u2026 maybe if they were like Lee Sunghoon.Lee Hayeon reluctantly agreed and nodded her head.\u201c\u2026Okay. But we can't stay too long.\u201d\u201cI know, the trial is still going on.\u201dShe walked into the building with her head down.I followed her in and stopped in the living room.It was there where I finally opened my mouth.\u201cIf we come face to face with the opposing team, can you use your buffs on me?\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes?\u201d\u201cIt may sound selfish but I think it would be the best use of them in that situation.\u201dShe seemed to be caught off guard.\u201cI\u2014 no, it's just\u2026 that's what you wanted to say?\u201dShe might be talking about getting robbed.\u201cNo.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksIt's not like I didn't have a conscience.Plus, I didn't really think I was in great need of items.I had my dagger and the cloak, and that's been enough.She took a deep breath and slowly nodded.She looked a little red from the misunderstanding.\u201cEhem.\u201dIt didn't last very long and she turned back into her normal composed self.\u201c\u2026Okay but, we'll only be able to hold on for a little bit.\u201dThat was something I expected.\u201cI know. All I need is an agility buff. I'll take care of everything else.\u201dLee Sunghoon and Lee Hayeon wouldn't last that long against the other team so we had to find another way to gain an advantage.Murder\u2014 in the first trial I was clearing with other challengers.Lee Sunghoon wasn't much help and Lee Hayeon was suited for the backline.Hence, I was the only one who could do it.'I should put as much pressure on them as possible with the buffs.'That's the best we could do.Lee Sunghoon probably wouldn't care for this but\u2026'He's not here so\u2026'Lee Sunghoon was currently muttering beside a couple of goblin corpses.He wasn't even attempting to listen in on the conversation.\u201cI'll take care of as many of them as I can while you fend them off.\u201d\u201cSo all I have to do is buff you from the back.\u201d\u201cYeah. You don't have to prepare any offensive buffs if it's too much. Just the agility one is fine.\u201d\u201cI can give you other types of buffs\u2026\u201d\u201cYou can give all the non-agility ones to Lee Sunghoon. He'll need it to defend you.\u201dI couldn't monopolize the buffs if I wanted them to stay alive.Of course, he probably wouldn't like how he's being used right now\u2026But he probably wouldn't say anything unless something big came up.\u201cEven if Lee Sunghoon complains, I'll handle it.\u201dI threatened him once, I could do it again.She stood there a little dazed, as if she didn't understand what I was saying.\u201cWhy are you doing all this? You could just ignore us, but you\u2026?\u201dI wasn't sure. I'm not a very calculating person, but I knew one thing.It was foolish to make more enemies for trivial reasons.People like Lee Sunghoon are fine as enemies, but it was best to minimize friction with other types of people.Lee Hayeon was a teammate at least deserving of that.\u201cJust think of it as a consideration for a teammate.\u201dShe didn't press any further.Just a small smile.Good thing she wasn't as nervous anymore.\u201cI'll be in your care then.\u201dI stretched my hand out and she did the same.\u201cLikewise.\u201dIt finally felt like I was on a proper team.We rejoined Lee Sunghoon outside and he tilted his head in confusion.He must have realized we were both gone.\u201c\u2026Did you guys go somewhere?\u201d\u201cWe just had some business to take care of.\u201dOf course, he didn't ask any further and just turned the other way.I opened my mouth after seeing him quiet down.\u201cAlright then. Let's continue.\u201dOur teamwork had gotten better after fighting off the waves of goblins.We kept our formation and made our way inward.Toward the goblin king that Lee Hayeon detected.I kept my guard up as much as I could, and there was something strange.We were moving pretty fast but not a single goblin came out.'There were goblins coming out regularly till now\u2026'The goblins came in bigger and bigger waves.But it was so quiet that it felt as if that was all imagined.\u201cThe other team must have passed by here already.\u201d\u201cThat's crazy, they got here faster than us?\u201dThe floating goblin corpses in the fountain caught our eye.Heavily armed corpses lying all around.\u201cBut it doesn't look like they've been dead for too long.\u201dI spoke as I crouched down to touch the corpses.It wasn't that hard to figure out.'It must be fresh because there's still heat left in the body.'That meant they weren't too far from here.We just missed them.\u201cThey probably just entered the goblin king's lair.\u201dA message from the tower arrived at the same time.\u300c An intruder has infiltrated the tower. \u300d\u300c All the goblins around the area are being called towards the king. \u300dI didn't know how strong the king would be, but we didn't have any time to waste.It would get worse when all the goblins got here.\u201cPrepare for battle.\u201dThere's only one correct response to that.\u201cWe're going in.\u201dThe time to hunt just goblins was over.It was time to fight against the other challengers.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If you weren't even a hunter you should at least know your place.\u201dThe man who was being called trash, Lee Jinhoo, apologized while cowering.\u201cI-I'm sorry Sangyoon hyung-nim, It's my mista\u2014\u201d\u201cA mistake? God damn. Do you even realize where you're at right now?\u201dIm Sangyoon raised his glasses with a finger and glared at Lee Jinhoo.It didn't sit well with them that a civilian who was relying on the hunters to pass the trial was responding so slowly.But the threatening atmosphere didn't last long.\u201cWhatever, are you sure the goblin king is in here?\u201dIm Sangyoon stepped back at Lee Sieon's question and Lee Jinhoo quietly answered him.\u201cW-when I used my question, it said one of the bosses lived here\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd you don't know for sure it's the goblin?\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026\u201d\u201cTsk, can't you think before you speak? If the only thing we fought on the way here were goblins, the boss would obviously be the goblin king.\u201d\u201cI-I see.\u201d\u201cSo we're sure the boss is here.\u201dAfter coming to that conclusion, Lee Sieon looked around the tower.'Wow, it's pretty damn big.'The city view was shocking enough but the interior design of the tower was also surprising.An oil painting perfectly suiting the atmosphere\u2026Glowing rocks placed around the tower gave the place a dreamy aura.Even Lee Sieon, who had been a C-rank hunter, had never experienced anything like this.'I don't know how this tower works, but it sure is impressive.'The scenes from dungeons couldn't even compare to this tower.Not only were the monsters in a league of their own, the equipment was interesting as well.Also\u2014'The rewards don't even compare to what you can get from a dungeon.'As strong as the monsters were, the rewards made it worth it.If he could take this back into the outside world, it would be possible to get above a C-rank.'Actually, I probably wouldn't even have to continue to be a hunter.'The information Lee Sieon could provide would be priceless to the hunter association.He could make enough from the just information to be set for life.Whatever happened, things would work out for Lee Sieon.He felt a little apprehensive when all his abilities reset, but looking back, this was a very good opportunity.Of course, Lee Jinhoo couldn't even dream of that.'Would keeping him alive complicate things later?'If Lee Jinhoo went around spreading information, it would lower the value of his own information.Logically, it would make the most sense to kill him and take his items.Too bad he was such trash.'It would have been better if he was a novice hunter or something\u2026\u201dLee Sieon thought about what could have been, but he snapped out of it.'Whatever. At least we got here without any problems.'The good news was that the other team wasn't here yet.They'd fail automatically once we killed the goblin king.\u201cLet's take care of the boss and get out of here.\u201d\u201cSieon hyung-nim, what formation should we use?\u201d\u201cWhat else?

Lead the way.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201dLee Jinhoo stared up at the giant door with a depressed look.An all-encompassing eye was engraved onto the door, staring him down.He could sense that the boss battle would start as soon as the door opened.Lee Jinhoo feared another life-threatening battle but\u2026If he resisted, the two behind could kill him.Lee Jinhoo shut his eyes and muttered.\u201cI'm opening it now.\u201dAnd as his trembling hands inched towards the door\u2014Krrrroong.Lee Sieon and Im Sangyoon turned their heads at a sudden sound from the back.\u300c The competing team has entered the goblin king's spiral tower. \u300dAt that moment, a message they've never seen before appeared in front of their eyes.\u300c Requirement fulfilled. \u300d\u300c Special objective 'competition' is starting. \u300d\u300c The boss battle cannot be begun until only one of the two teams is left.

Man, this is like the worst-case scenario.\u201dThe other team had entered the tower.\u300c Special objective 'competition' is starting. \u300dA message appeared as soon as they entered the ashy spiral tower.'Special objective?'It wasn't a type of message anyone had previously experienced.That means this was inherent to the tower of trials.'What is\u2026'I hesitated for a bit because I hadn't seen anything like this, even after entering the tower.But the objective of the trial was competition so it made sense.'I knew it wouldn't be this straightforward.'The tower blocked off all other options.It was playing dirty, but this still wasn't something I hadn't expected from the tower.'There are three enemies and they\u2026 have a mage.'The man with glasses was wearing a luxurious robe holding a staff embedded with a blue orb.No matter how you looked at it, he was a mage.Just the fact that they had a backline was nerve-wracking.Mages were a rare resource after all.There was also a small trembling swordsman and a man holding a crossbow.They seemed to be more balanced than my team.'The center of their team must be the guy with the crossbow.'He had a more refined stance than the other two and, overall, just looked like he knew what he was doing.At least, he wasn't afraid to fight.Then\u2014\u201cHa, fuck. Man, this is like the worst-case scenario.\u201dThe man with the crossbow muttered under his breath and opened his eyes.The eyes couldn't be described as anything but those of a reptile.\u201cYo, trash. Take care of the one that looks like an assassin. Just stall for time and don't do anything else.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe man who was called trash didn't even have time to respond.That was because as soon as he finished speaking, the challenger with the crossbow took off.Koong.A low-pitched echo rang out as the man with the crossbow moved rapidly.Shik!'A throwing knife?'He pulled a knife from his thigh and threw it as if he didn't want to use the crossbow from the start.He must have had a weapons skill because the knife cut through the air with the sound of a hissing snake.However, my stats were at their peak from absorbing all kinds of goblins.I wouldn't get hit by this even if I wanted to.Ting!A petite swordsman closed in on me as I tilted my shield to block the knife.\u201caaaaah!\u201dHis clearly scared eyes were rejecting any form of combat but\u2026That didn't stop him from running at me.No, he swung even more wildly in his tunnel vision.Chang!I didn't block it with a shield this time and instead deflected it with my sword.'I guess that was just a distraction to let him get close to me.'I had no intention of letting things go the way he planned.Using the recoil from the deflection, I planned to kill the swordsman and go after the crossbow dude.But his blade flowed smoothly to almost forbid that from happening.Contrary to the fear-ridden eyes and trembling hands, his sword made a sharp and clean arc.He definitely had a sword-related skill.'Damn, this complicates things.'I couldn't be delayed with him any longer.\u201cLee Hayeon, now!\u201d\u201cOkay!\u201d\u300c You have received 'Wind's Blessing. \u300d\u300c While your agility is below 50, there is an extra status bonus. \u300d\u300c Agility is temporarily increased by +3. \u300d\u300c Time left \u2013 00:09:59 \u300dFor an instant, my body blended into the wind and my vision faltered.Combined with all the stats I've been absorbing, I felt almost omnipotent.What the fuck\u2026 Lee Sunghoon couldn't fight off the goblins with this?The swordsman shouldn't be able to follow my movements anymore.When I was sure, I lightly swung my obsidian dagger.But the enemy blocked my swing as if it was laughing at my assurance.Chang!The swordsman who couldn't even keep his hands steady somehow read and blocked my attack.Initially, I thought he was hiding his skill but quickly realized that wasn't the case.\u201cInnate ability!'That was it.Like how I acquired Necromancy, this man also acquired something.I forgot about it because I'd been oppressing monsters with my stats, but innate abilities could change the tide of the battle.I had to figure out what it was.I withdrew my sword and took a step back.Then I felt slightly relieved looking at Lee Sunghoon and Lee Hayeon fight.Seeing that he could block the arrows from the crossbow, it looks like Lee Sunghoon's 'mana resistance' innate ability wasn't just for show.Of course, he's using his greatsword and not a shield\u2026But he was doing better than I thought.The crossbow challenger also couldn't get in close because he was being wary of Lee Hayeon.'Good thing the other team's mage is also a support.'The man had an increased reload speed, shot speed, and agility.But Lee Sunghoon's 'mana resistance' was able to nullify some of the effects of the skills.He'd been moving fast and kiting from distance, but it didn't seem to be very effective.They'd come right in if they realized how weak he was but\u2026'They can't press forward that strongly now.'There are a lot of elements that could change the tide of the battle and I had the ability to change it.So I turned to the swordsman and focused my attention on him.Chang!'He definitely doesn't have a buff that lets him keep up with my movements.'Their mage didn't cast a single buff to their fragile swordsman.Maybe he was a decoy and they were going all-in on the crossbowman.Then the only thing keeping him alive was his innate ability.Ch-chang! Chang!Once I released a barrage of slashes, he started fumbling.This would be the most effective way to figure out what his ability was.His moves would get simpler if he didn't get a chance to think about his moves.As I predicted, the swordsman's eyes moved before my sword did.That's when I was able to figure out this man's innate ability.Damn, that's why he's able to block my attacks.'He can see where I'll attack.'He's able to see the trajectory of my blade and can swing his blade even before I start attacking.After figuring out his innate ability, figuring out a way to get around it was instant.If his ability relies on 'sight' then all I have to do is block his 'sight.'Whoosh!I swung my shield like a frisbee and threw it at the swordsman.'It's a little risky but it's the only way\u2026!'Flustered, the swordsman flailed to hit the shield away and.A 'hole' in his innate ability was exposed.With his line of vision blocked, I stepped in close and took another swing.Shuak!Blood splattered everywhere and in an instant, the entire hall froze.Everyone froze for a second and all stared at me.\u201cW-wha\u2026 I don\u2026\u201d\u201cWait, he couldn't even stall\u2026?\u201dThey were wondering what I did to kill him that quickly.Enemies and allies alike looked at me in shock.And amongst the center of it all, I was horrified.It wasn't that I killed someone for the first time.I had already made the decision to do it and the enemy was also trying to do the same.The most shocking part was the message that appeared in front of me.\u300c Would you like to absorb the soul of the player 'Lee Jinhoo'? \u300dThe black fog over the falling corpse and the message above it was telling me.'Holy\u2026'Necromancy could absorb human souls.____Hyung-nim is a formal way for a Korean male to address another Korean male.Also, I think the story is starting to pick up eyyy____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The fight isn't over.'The special objective said that no one would be able to leave this area until only one team was left.Any more contemplating could put my life at risk.I dashed past the message and threw myself into battle.Kuang!My body shot out like an arrow as I pushed it off the ground.\u201cFuck, you fucking fuck!\u201dThe crossbow challenger had a burst of outrage.Not at the fact that his teammate died\u2026Only because his bait was gone.It would be hard to stop me with a long-ranged damage dealer and a support.In addition to that, Lee Hayeon was in perfect shape, even if Lee Sunghoon was a tad ragged.They would have to use all their cards to change the flow of this battle.Click, thunk. Psst!I raised my left hand to block the arrow but the familiar weight in my hand was missing.'The shield\u2026 Oh yeah, I threw it.'Going to pick up a shield while being focused on would practically be suicide.What would happen if I got hit with an unexpected innate ability while relying on my high stats?If they had a more offensive ability than reading trajectories, it was obvious what would happen to me.'It would be too late to think about this at that point.'I had to turn this into an opportunity.After the resolution, I thrust forward even faster.It was too late to go for the shield now, I'd just have to trust the sword in my right hand.Shhhft\u2026!I tilted my head to narrowly dodge the shot.My heart thundered and my entire body heated up as I realized there was nothing to cover my body.The lack of the shield left me both physically and psychologically exposed.I had to keep it cool.'Calmly, without being too conscientious.'Being shaken now could lead to my downfall.My opponent also saw this as an opportunity and continued to shoot.Psst!Two staggered daggers darted towards me at an instant.The clearly refined high-tier skill sent shivers down my spine.Maybe it was due to all the adrenaline, but it was as if time had slowed down and my vision widened.Combined with the increased awareness from the new skill, I could see what they were scheming.This was just a ploy to trap me to restrict my speed.'He's waiting for the moment I dodge the daggers to shoot his crossbow\u2026'If I got shot by an arrow now, it would be critical no matter where it landed.There was only one answer to this.'Precisely deflect the oncoming daggers\u2026!'I slightly raised my sword and slammed the handle of the dagger heading for my abdomen.Tang!In one smooth motion, I also parried the dagger approaching my left eye.Chang!I almost let out a howl of victory as the sound of metal hitting metal rang in the room.'I did it\u2026!'But I had no time to give myself a pat on the back.As I accelerated towards the man with the crossbow, my opponent stretched his hands out to me and uttered these words.\u201cSnake's Binding!\u201dMy legs froze as they were about to push off the ground.\u300c Due to the effects of the innate ability 'Snake's Binding,' your movement is restricted for 10 seconds. \u300d\u300c After 5 seconds, the restriction to your movement will weaken. \u300dIt was as if a king cobra was squeezing my whole body.As I expected, he pulled out his final resort.But the problem is that this ability was super effective against me.I tried to struggle out of it but it was no use.'A restriction type innate ability!'It was the worst kind.I expected that he would use one, but I didn't expect it to be this.An Achilles' heel for someone with my combat style.He seemed to know this as he smirked and opened his mouth.\u201cThat's what I thought, you bastard! Im Sangyoon, shoot him now!\u201dThe man who I presumed to be Im Sangyoon pointed his staff at me as an arrow of ice formed.'No casting. It's another innate ability\u2026!'The arrows made from white ice were emitting a conspicuous aura.It was obvious that those arrows would pierce straight through me.Even with the tenacity I gained from the Elixir of Steel, it wouldn't strengthen my skin immediately.I pulled on every fiber of my muscles, but it was to no avail.'Dammit, there has to be a way to get out\u2026!'The arrows pierced through the empty void before I had any chance to think.Phing\u2026!An attack I couldn't dodge or block, but all my senses were heightened.1sec, 2sec, 3sec\u2026My muscles squirmed as I counted the seconds down.When I realized there was no way to get out of this, I gave up on breaking free from this.And instead\u2026I poured all my strength into my legs, waiting for the moment the restrictions weakened.Argghh\u2014\u300c The effects of the binding have weakened. \u300dThe squirming muscles moved all of the sudden and my body fell backward.And in that instant, the arrows flew past my eyes in the space where I used to stand.The system said the effects were weakened, but it was still no joke.It was like a thousand pounds crushing down my shoulders.'What kind of innate ability\u2026'If it wasn't for my overwhelmingly high stats, there would be a hole through my head already.I finally realized why this was the trial of competition and how important teamwork was.This fucking tower gave a huge handicap to solo players.At the same time, I felt cheated.I mean, the only people on my team are a compass and a meat shield, and they get a whole team with offensive innate abilities?Why did this only happen to my team?If only I had someone to complain to\u2026\u300c Using the Assassin's Cloak(C)'s active ability. \u300d\u300c Movement speed +15% \u300d\u300c Activation time left \u2013 00:00:59 \u300d\u201cWh Wait! L-let's talk! I didn't do it on purpose!\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksI was slower than before, so the crossbow challenger had some time to react.But we tried to kill each other and there was no mistake in that.I couldn't let my guard down listening to his excuses.As he fumbled to load another arrow into his crossbow, I cut his head off.Shuat!\u300c Would you like to absorb the soul of the player 'Lee Sieon? \u300dThe black fog and message notified me of his death.Plumph.The man in glasses looked in horror as the decapitated corpse collapsed in front of him.\u201cU-uhh, ahhhh!\u201dFeebly wiping the blood off his glasses, Im Sangyoon's entire body trembled.His hands, legs, and even his teeth clacked enough to fill the empty room.I'd confirmed that his innate ability, magic, and skills weren't a threat to me.He was only strong with a team.I flicked my arm to get the blood off and turned my head.And there, a terrified Lee Hayeon and retracted Lee Sunghoon stared at me.The battle was over and no one on our team seemed to have sustained any injuries.Maybe the big cut on Lee Sunghoon's arm, but it'd go away once he was in the waiting area.It didn't look like something that would bother him in battle.'At least we didn't lose any power.'I was worried that he might not be able to pull his weight in the boss battle, but it should be fine.My teammates still seemed to be in shock, but I had to decide\u2026What we would do with Im Sangyoon.\u201cP-p-please let me live\u2026 You're not a murderer right?\u201dMaybe he determined that he couldn't win because he'd lost his last teammate.He begged for his life as he trembled like a leaf.\u201cWe, we, we can go back to Earth right? I'll give you all my money. I-I have a lot of money.\u201d\u201cI-I was a hunter. You can scrape like $500k from me.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cR-really? If you just let me live!\u201d\u201cYou know I can't do that.\u201dIm Sangyoon's face crinkled.\u201cThe special objective said that no one could get out until only one team was left.\u201d\u201cY-you don't know that. Maybe there's another way.\u201d\u201cNo there isn't. That's why you tried to kill me too.\u201dAnd even if there was\u2026Why should I let someone who tried to kill me go?He almost killed me and wouldn't be much help in the upcoming boss battle.'I've come too far to feel guilt.'It was too late to be a saint.\u201cDamn.\u201dI didn't even know what to say.A dirty feeling was swallowing me as if I was in a puddle of quicksand.The lukewarm blood dripping down my arm only cemented that feeling.I wasn't a saint, but I wasn't a cold-blooded serial killer either.Standing between that line made me feel shitty.Status window, skills, stats\u2026A lot of things changed after the Great Calamity, but it didn't affect one's individual choices.'Kill people for bonus rewards?'Hunters hunt monsters, not people.Then how would I differ from the monsters that killed my parents?The reason I became a player 7 years ago was to kill monsters.Not this.I wanted to kill monsters and reduce the number of people who would be affected by them.But the tower didn't seem to care about any of that.Trials, rewards, and growth.I was coming to know what the tower expected and wanted from us.I wasn't an evil person, but I wasn't good enough to let people get in my way.I gripped my obsidian dagger and stomped closer to the panicked Im Sangyoon.\u201cD-don't come! L-let's talk this ou\u2014\u201dI sliced his neck open without listening to another word.Shhhk\u2014A new message appeared.\u300c Congratulations, you've cleared the special objective. \u300d\u300c Bonus rewards being calculated into the 4th trial's rewards. \u300dI stared at that message silently for a while.'\u2026The shield, I gotta pick up my shield.'I grabbed the shield from the floor and re-equipped it.I turned back to face my team.\u201cIt's over. Let's get ready to fight the boss.\u201dLee Hayeon and Lee Sunghoon studied my facial expression.I knew I didn't have the best expression right now, but they kept flinching for some reason.I didn't want to show this face to anyone else either but\u2026'I guess it doesn't matter.'I couldn't hide it even if I wanted to.\u201cUm\u2026 are you alright?\u201dLee Hayeon delicately asked how I was.\u201cI'm fine.\u201dTruthfully, I wasn't. But what else could I say?\u201c\u2026Okay. Should we go in now?\u201dLee Hayeon didn't probe any further.Lee Sunghoon also looked at me and carefully made a suggestion.\u201cI'm not too hurt so we can go in now.\u201d\u201cI'm fine too.\u201dWe finished our conversation and moved to the giant door with the eye on it.I hesitated when walking by the corpses with the necromancy message on them, but I'd put that decision on hold.\u2026I had killed some people, but I didn't have the resolve to absorb their souls as well.'I\u2026 still need some time to think.'Of course, I may not have a choice\u2026But at least right now, I wasn't psychologically ready for it yet.If I absorbed a human soul right now, what's left of my mentality would probably shatter.I could always come back after.As long as I didn't go through the portal after the trial ended.All I needed was some time to calm my nerves.Then I'd be able to make a logical decision.I put my hands on the door and began to speak.\u201cI'm opening it now.\u201dAnd\u2014\u300c You have entered the goblin king's chamber. \u300dI could finally see the end of this trial.________Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You have overcome the Tower of Trials floor 4. \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received 'unlock innate ability.' \u300d\u300c As a reward, all your stats have been increased by +4. \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received '5,500 points.' \u300d\u300c As a bonus reward, you have received the skill 'Instant Acceleration (D)' \u300d\u300c As a bonus reward, you have received '2,000 points.' \u300d\u300c Please move to the waiting area. \u300d\u300c Moving to the waiting room. \u300dMy body instantly felt lighter, reflecting the stat changes.In terms of utility, that reward was just as good as a skill or an item.Higher base stats meant being able to do more things.'Rewards are good.'It was worth going through the damn trial.Voom!A portal appeared in front of the giant throne the goblin king once sat on.Yes, that was it.This was how the 4th trial ended.But\u2014My thoughts were still jumbled in my head like a tangled ball of wire.\u201cI'm sorry but\u2026 am I free to go?\u201dLee Sunghoon quietly asked an uncharacteristically respectful question.\u201cWhy are you asking me that? You can just go.\u201d\u201c\u2026W-well, I'll head out.\u201dVoom!I guess that was the end of our relationship.There was still another hunter standing behind me without moving.It was Lee Hayeon.\u201cDo you have anything to say?\u201dOnce I asked, she responded immediately.\u201c\u2026I know I may be overstepping my bounds but you did what you had to do.\u201d\u201cDid I?\u201d\u201cYeah. Someone had to do it and if you hadn't, I would have.\u201d\u201cI'm glad you think that way.\u201dIt was obvious what she was talking about.Murder, and some morally gray acts of threatening Lee Sunghoon.Looking back, I was a cold-blooded bastard during the entire trial.I was acting with a tiny bit of conscience, but only for my own benefit.Because I didn't want to resort to murder unless I had no choice.\u201cYou're strong. Even if you were only a player outside, you were probably strong.\u201dThat stung a little.'Eh, not really.'I just got insanely strong after entering the tower.Out of nowhere, Lee Hayeon tapped the empty space in front of her.I didn't understand what she was doing for a while, but it was soon made clear.\u300c Challenger Lee Hayeon has sent you a friend request. \u300dIt was one of the features of the community.I forgot about it because I thought I'd never have a use for it but\u2026I was speechless for a second.Lee Hayeon noticed this and quickly backpedaled her preposition.\u201cUh, um, you can ignore it if you'd like.\u201d\u201cNo. it's not like that. I was just wondering why you sent something like this to me.\u201d\u201cWell, you basically single-handedly cleared the trial for us, and I wanted to give you some sort of compensation.\u201d\u201cIf you ever get back to Earth, look for Lee Hayeon of the White Silver guild.\u201d\u201cOh, if you're trying to recruit me\u2026\u201d\u201cN-no it's not like that! It's just if you need anything at all.\u201dI couldn't help but smile at her fumbling.She had a stoic face the entire time, so it was nice to see this side of her.\u201cWe can help you connect with guilds, merchants, hunters, dungeons\u2026 whatever you might need. Our guild specializes in that. And of course, we can do it free of charge.\u201dI nodded at her salesman-like pitch.Honestly, it was an attractive offer and I didn't want to reject her thanks.'And I don't know if she's trying to use me or not, but I can figure that out later.'I wasn't so thoughtless that I couldn't tell the difference between good and ill will.\u201cOkay. I'll leave a message if I can.\u201d\u300c You've accepted the friend request from challenger Lee Hayeon. \u300dA bashful smile appeared on her face as she read the message.This one seemed genuine compared to the distanced smiles from before.\u201cI'll be heading out now too. Get to the 8th floor safely.\u201d\u201cOkay. I wish you a safe climb up as well.\u201dVoom!The silence was deafening after the smiling hunter entered the portal.To be honest, I was thankful to this tower.The tower was the one that gave me, someone with nothing, a second chance.But the tower pushed people to the limits.The life-threatening battles, and now, murder.'Fighting the monsters wasn't that bad.'It pushed people just enough for them to survive and grow.I was on a high from the rewards I'd been receiving.But I could finally distance myself from all of this and see everything in a more objective light.I was just blinded by all the rewards the tower had been dangling in front of me.The tower of trials didn't just make people stronger in a normal manner.However\u2014After experiencing this ruthlessness, I still didn't want to stop.For the first time in my life, I wanted something more than to become just a hunter.I wanted to climb the tower.A part of me craved to get stronger, but it was also because this tower was the closest thing to the 'Great Calamity.'Where monsters came from, and why gates appear.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksI had a feeling that I'd find out more about what happened to the world as I climbed the tower\u2026Above all, it was because I knew that whoever adapted the fastest was the one who survived the calamity.Of course\u2014'There are also other things to be earned from here.'One merit was that I could get infinitely stronger here.No matter what it was, the tower gave me a chance to grow stronger and I was going to take it.Even if it meant crushing others to do so\u2026And from the 8th floor, I wouldn't be hesitant to climb up anymore.Because everyone who remained would have done so of their own volition.So first, I decided to absorb all of the souls in the tower.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the goblin king. \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Lee Jinhoo.' \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Lee Sieon.' \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Im Sangyoon.' \u300dShaaa\u2026!All of the fog spiraled into my palm to be absorbed.I wouldn't kill just to get stronger, but I would if the situation forced me to.It was too late to have any qualms about that anyway.'I can digest these souls later.'Once I absorbed all the souls, I headed to the portal.\u300c Moving to the waiting room. \u300dI could always check the rewards later.It was time to heal up first.\u300c You have entered the 5th floor waiting room. \u300d\u300c Healing all injuries and status ailments. \u300d\u300c The healing effect is constantly applied in the waiting room. \u300dThe familiar messages greeted me again.But the following messages weren't something I've seen yet.\u300c More than a thousand people have cleared the 5th trial. \u300d\u300c The system expansion is starting. \u300d\u300c A system that ranks trial clears, 'Trial Evaluation' is being created. \u300d\u300c New categories are being added to the marketplace. \u300d\u300c More items are now available in the marketplace. \u300d\u300c You are now able to change your nickname. \u300d\u201cA system expansion.\u201dLike we figured out previously, the expansion was finally starting.I knew it was going to happen, but it still felt surprising.It felt like it was only yesterday when I was putting my life at risk to kill the sand golem\u2026'I guess I got stronger pretty quickly.'Slightly nostalgic, I checked out the newly expanded system.\u201cTrial Evaluation.\u201dUpon the command, a decorated hologram appeared in front of me.\u300c 4th Trial Evaluations \u300d1st, Kim Seunghoon(SS+)2nd, Lee Junghoon(SS)3rd, WhatsANicknameChange(SS)4th, Hae Sunah(SS-)5th, LightningBladeMaster(SS-)6th, MaxLevelSwordsman(S+)\u201cFairly intuitive.\u201dClicking the name at the top of the board expanded the details.1st, Kim Seunghoon(SS+)4th Trial Clear Time (00:34:21)4th Trial Clear Process (SSS)4th Trial Clear Result (SS-)4th Trial Clear Evaluation (SS+)Is this record humanly possible?'I mean, what?

could wear to what you could eat.'I can't even take a proper shower and all my clothes are tattered now.'I hid it to the best of my ability with my cloak\u2026 but I would pass for a homeless man in

I might as well go back to Earth now.'I at least wanted to clean myself up a bit.Take a proper shower, eat a proper meal, and get some proper rest.I also wanted to get my money back from the training gym.Just because I got stronger didn't mean that anything changed about the outside world.An incompetent player barely surviving off of part-time jobs.Getting back the 7 years of fees would be important right now.$35,000 wasn't a small sum.'I have to save as much as possible right now.'If I didn't have enough points, I'd have just stayed and forgot about the money.But frankly, I had more than a comfortable amount of points to buy all the equipment I needed.'Maybe it's because of the special objective, but it's a decent amount of points.'Basically, I had more than enough to go back to Earth.Also\u2014'It'll be more worth it if I take care of some other business at the same time.'I pushed some mana into the stone I had been fidgeting with in my hands.\u300c Challenger Han Sungyeun, confirming intention to return. \u300d\u300c Consuming the Return Stone to return to Earth. \u300dAt that moment, my world turned black.My heart sank as soon as I opened my eyes.A familiar ceiling, and the same old studio as I turned my head.Seven rules that all hunters must know and follow in dungeons.S-class hunter's methods to become a better hunter.How to pass the hunter's exam and the training that follows.Post-its with all kinds of information stood out from the room.I had copied them down by hand to pound the knowledge into my head.For an instant, I thought I had just imagined the whole 'Tower of Trials' thing.A fear that everything I had worked for was nothing but a figment of my imagination.But\u2014\u300c Returned to challenger Han Sungyeun's residence. \u300dThe negative thoughts were pushed aside by the intruding message.And the next few messages prompted me to get moving.\u300c Returning to the tower after 3 days. \u300d\u300c We wish the challenger a satisfactory time. \u300dI had to take care of all my business within their time limits.'Stingy.'As I lifted myself off the bed, something bumped into my hand.Tak.\u201c\u2026No, wait.\u201dI stared blankly at what I just bumped into.\u201c\u2026Why is this here?\u201dA jet-black knife and handle, clearly a masterpiece.The obsidian dagger I received as a trial reward was laying on my desk.And on the left side, the deadwood I was holding lay there.'No way.'I snagged at the bedsheets to find another kind of fabric on them.The item I'd been using since the 2nd trial, assassin's cloak.Contrary to my belief, I was able to carry all of my items back with me.I was flustered for a second, but I decided that it was just a little gift from the tower.\u201cI guess that's one more thing on my to-do list.\u201dThere were several things that I needed to take care of.I lifted the deadwood shield and let out a smile.'I thought I might need a little more money.'Time to make some big bucks.____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

the items I bought with points transferred over as well.But\u2014\u201cYeah, of course they don't work.\u201dTrial, info, community, marketplace, inventory\u2026Nothing worked so I soon gave up.'Well, it would have been weirder if any of them worked.'Even if only the inventory worked, the benefits would have been enormous.I cut my losses and picked an outfit from the closet.There was no way I could stand the stench and filth coming from myself anymore.'I'm surprised that I lasted this long.'It was something accomplished after I set out to conserve as many points as possible.I jumped into the shower and turned the dial to the hottest temperature.Squeezing out every bottle within my reach, I scrubbed my body to get the dry blood off.Even after two hours, the distinct aroma remained.After the wash, I dried my hair with a towel and stared at myself in the mirror.The muscles that were previously hiding behind the layer of fat were now in the spotlight.The changes to my stats manifested into these marble-sculpted muscles.\u201cHm, so this is what I look like.\u201dIt was hard to tell since I could never get a good look at myself, but it was bizarre to see it in person.I was already a veteran hunter appearance wise.\u2026Although in reality, it was built with a series of short battles.'At least it looks good.'I felt a little self indulgent as I dressed myself.It wasn't luxurious in any way, but this bed was so much better than the one in the waiting area.And frankly, this alone made the 500 points worth it.'Wow, I've never been more comfortable in my life.'Even if it was just taking a shower and laying on a cushy bed.I was never able to relax to this extent in the tower.I'd be satisfied by just laying here and eating all kinds of delivery foods.But this wasn't enough to break my will.Even if it was dangling in front of me like a carrot on a stick, I knew how to control myself.'Let's organize everything I need to do first.'Still laid back, staring at the ceiling, I started formulating a plan.There were three major reasons why I came back to Earth.One, to relieve some psychological stress and take time to charge back up.Two, to get my refund from the player training center.Three, to prove my qualifications as a hunter and get a better standing in life.'Technically, the third one is the most important.'The third reason I came back was to take the hunter exam.To get the license to go into dungeons and hunt monsters.That's what I came to get.It was the only thing that drove me for the past 7 years.Plus, just getting the license would be helpful in general.'I can definitely pass the exam right now.'I beat the challengers who used to be hunters, and the exam shouldn't be any different.The question was what rank I'd be placed in.In the hunter exam, the highest one could be ranked was C.'I'm also curious to see where I rank\u2026'There were also a lot of benefits that came along with it.I'd be able to officially put my items for sale and get access to gates.If anyone asked if this was important enough to come back to Earth for, I'd answer immediately.'I wasn't the only one who was summoned to the Tower of Trials.'There were other players, civilians, and even professional hunters.Since there were more people reaching the 5th floor, more information about the tower would be revealed.It would be nice to be a hunter before all of that goes down.Hunters had access to so much more information in every aspect compared to a normal person.'The association would overflow with applications by then.'If enough civilians survived, they would all be eligible hunters.That was inevitable.'I need the hunter license to at least sell all my items.'When ordinary people try to sell hunter items, there tends to be a lot of fees and they get scammed a lot.But hunters didn't have that kind of disadvantage.Why?'Because no one knows more about these items than hunters.'To begin with, they were treated differently.If a trainee was to put something up for sale, there was a big chance of getting scammed.And even if they didn't, the high fees would take away most of the profits.'I'll apply to the hunter exam online first\u2026'Then I contemplated what to do next.Grrrwl.\u201c\u2026.Oh yeah, I have to take care of this too.\u201dI smiled at the noise coming from my stomach and got up from the bed.I was sick and tired of eating jerky.Since I was presentable enough, nothing was holding me back from going out.\u201cThere's a bunch of things I wanted to eat once I got back here anyway.\u201dChicken, soda, pizza, burgers, Korean barbecue\u2026There were so many things I wanted to eat in the tower.Human beings are gluttonous by nature, so it was no surprise that that's where my attention went.Of course, I forced myself to survive on the beef jerky with pure willpower\u2026Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksBut\u2014'There was nothing I wanted more than this.'I stared at the tender chunks of pork swimming in the steaming clear broth.It was a traditional gukbap* restaurant near my apartment.Chicken and pizza all sounded good, but nothing could beat this.'I'd rather down a piping hot bowl of pork gukbap.'Stirring the sauce into the bowl, I took a hearty bite of what could only be described as heavenly.When the perfect combination of spicy and hot soup slid down my throat.\u201cKaaaah\u2026.\u201dA moan of ecstasy inadvertently came out of my mouth.Once I dipped a spoonful of rice into the soup and put it in my mouth, I couldn't resist anymore.My head went empty as I shoved down the rest of the bowl down my throat.After two more bowls, I finally felt satisfied.I felt myself slipping into a food coma, but I shook myself awake and took out my wallet to pay for the meal.Oh, and the wallet I thought had disappeared when I was transferred to the tower was on the floor next to the bed.Same with my smartphone.The battery was a little low, but it was still usable.\u201cPhew, I'm so full.\u201dMy thoughts were finally starting to organize themselves now that my stomach was full.Hm, my next order of business is\u2026'Going to the training center for my refund.'As big of a name the center was, I poured a lot of money into there.It would be a waste to not get it back.But thinking about it a little harder, it might be more worth it to not get it back.Of course, it wasn't because of the little pride I had left.'Wouldn't it be easier to make use of the gym's name?'Players in dedicated hunter training centers got a fast pass to take the exam.This center was no exception.Normally, you could only take the hunter exam a day or two after applying for it.'Then I won't be able to utilize my time here as effectively as possible.'But if I applied through a center, I'd be able to skip all the paperwork and the written exam and just take the practical.Of course, you'd still need to show an impressive amount of skill to pass but\u2026I didn't think that would be a problem for me.\u201cHm, what should I do?'There wasn't a good reason to be desperate for the money now that I knew I could sell the items from the tower.'I don't want to let the center keep my money but whatever.'Like with necromancy, I was the only one who'd be hindered by not using it.And time was a precious resource at this point.I couldn't afford to waste any more of it.'I'll use everything in my arsenal to prepare to go back to the tower.'Ring-ring.After I decided my course of action, I acted fast.A couple of rings later, a low voice answered the call.\u2026Hello, this is the manager of the White Lotus player training center, Hwang Manho.I smirked after hearing the hostility in his voice.\u201cYeah it's me, do you remember me, manager?\u201dYeah, I remember. You can just apply for the reimbursement online.I sensed annoyance and contempt in his tone, but that didn't matter.\u201cI changed my mind. I don't need that refund anymore.\u201d\u2026Are you serious? You can't take that back later.\u201cI'm not planning on it, but I want to ask for a favor.\u201dIf you want to keep on using the center, I can't allow\u2014\u201cHelp me apply for the hunter exam.\u201dFor a second, I thought the call dropped.It was like he didn't even know how to react to that.All of the sudden, Hwang Manho replied in a voice full of laughter.Sir, do you remember what you received on your evaluations?You received an overall ranking of F, that's a failing grade.\u201cI know.\u201dYou don't have an innate ability or skills. You're making this difficult for me.He didn't say it outright, but he was telling me to know my place.'Yeah, that's what I was going to do.'Technically, he wasn't wrong.I didn't know about anyone else, but I was considered to be the weakest of the weakest.But that was a story of the past.\u201cSo you can't do that even if I give you the money?\u201dHearing that I wasn't aggravated, he calmly replied.Well, I mean, I'm not going to reject $70,000.It was a little bitter to hear the amount of money I threw down the drain but\u2026I guess that just goes to show exactly how awful I was before the tower.He was being an ass about it, but this was as close to an acceptance as I was going to get.\u201cIt's a deal then. I'd like to take the exam today.\u201d\u2026Today, today. You must have gained a lot of confidence in the last couple of days.He didn't seem too pleased at my confidence and made a sly comment.A couple of days, huh?To him, it must look like I was full of unearned confidence.But I couldn't deny that I did get a huge ego boost recently.He wouldn't understand why I was suddenly acting like I had something other than persistence.It did make sense from his perspective though.Stats, innate abilities, skills\u2026Like Hwang Minho said, I didn't have anything that a normal hunter should have.But I wasn't the same person I was when I entered that tower.I knew that for a fact.This isn't me being cocky or arrogant.It was my rightly deserved self-assurance.So I didn't let him shove me around and gave a short answer.If I was the trash trainee Han Sungyeun up until now\u2026\u201cYes, I did.\u201dIt was now time for hunter Han Sungyeun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

What the fuck is that?\u201dHwang Manho thought back to the man silently concentrating on training.The man who had been eating away at the White Lotus brand for years.'Han Sungyeun.'Stats, skills, innate ability\u2026 Not one thing was ordinary for this man.Stats comparable to those of an athletic layman, and skills that didn't form even after completing all of the prerequisites.Yeah, he was a special case.There wasn't a single player weaker than Han Sungyeun.But\u2014The fact that he was still dedicated to training even after 7 years, and being the living embodiment of hard work not always paying off, had always rubbed him the wrong way.'Fool, why hasn't he given up even after having no talent?'To Hwang Manho, Han Sungyeun had no potential to become a hunter in this lifetime.And it bothered him that despite that fact, Han Sungyeun refused to give up.In the beginning, he was satisfied with sapping some money off the lad but\u2026'I didn't think he'd keep this up for 7 years.'More than just determination, Hwang Manho felt almost a certain obsession from the man.Like a man who'd die if he couldn't become a hunter.The obsession didn't sit well with him, but money was money.And to be honest, he didn't even really teach him well.After finding out his lack of talent, he basically just left him alone to train.Hwang Manho thought that he would quit after a couple months of that.But Han Sungyeun stuck around to become infamous among the trainees.In the end, Hwang Manho determined that he wasn't good for the brand and chased him out of the center.And that's where he thought his relationship with Han Sungyeun ended.But not even a month later, Han Sungyeun called him to make a deal.Help me apply for the hunter exam.It was arrogant.He was planning to give back at least half of the money if he asked for a refund.But to ask to take the exam out of the blue?'I didn't know that this is what he'd call for after all this time.'Maybe he was just trying to save face for the last time.Normally, you could only take the hunter exam a day or two after applying for it.As long as they were a player.Even if Hwang Manho vouched for him, he'd just be skipping the paperwork and written tests.'But that's not a good enough reason to give up all that money.'He was probably just doing this as a 'fuck you.'But he still had questions.How was he expecting to pass the practical exam?'He has no stats, skills, nor has he unlocked his innate ability.'He didn't even know what weapon he'd use during the exam.There could be one possibility though.'What if he unlocked his innate ability\u2026?'That would explain his newfound confidence.But no matter how superior the ability was, his stats were still below average.'Whether it's strength or mana\u2026'It was low enough to completely bury the benefits of a good innate ability.Even if he did unlock his ability, there wasn't anything he could have achieved with it.Most hunters have to go to a dungeon to get stronger.'There's no way a mere trainee could develop their skills.'They wouldn't even be able to get into a gate.No matter what happened, it wouldn't change the outcome.\u201cCocky bastard dug his own grave.\u201dHwang Manho grabbed his coat and prepared to head out.He'd have to accompany him as a supervisor if he wanted to skip out on the paperwork.'What could have possibly changed?'Those who were meant to succeed were born differently.Some people were meant to be heads, and Han Sungyeun didn't even have the ability to be a tail.\u201cI guess I'll make some preparations.\u201dHwang Manho took out his phone and started typing out a text.I'm planning to accompany someone to the hunter exam today. Can you fail them as fast as possible?Exam manipulation, a goto move by famous guilds and training centers.Typically, they donate massive amounts of money to raise the placement ranks of their preferred candidates.'But this should be enough to fail a no-name trainee.'Hwang Minho had some connections to the Hunter Association and he was planning to use that to get rid of Han Sungyeun.There was no other reason other than that he was annoyed with him.As long as he wasn't negatively affected in any way, Hwang Manho was fine with these malicious acts.It was a feeling similar to jealousy but something completely different.Hwang Manho realized how unethical this was but he wasn't very concerned.No one would care about a random trainee with no one to support him.After making the necessary preparations, the corner of his mouth rose.The Uijoenbu city's hunter association would be the last place Han Sungyeun would act as a player.Uijoenbu city's hunter association. I stood in front and gave off a bitter smile.It felt weird to come back here after almost a year.\u201cIt's been a while.\u201dThere was a time when I came here with dreams of becoming a hunter.It obviously didn't work out.'I passed the written exam but my practicals were just not up to par.'The examiner said that I was competing for the top spot in the written exam but my practical was enough to completely destroy my score.I heard the same for all following exams.The only thing that changed was that the examiners asked why I was so passionate about taking the test.Of course, they stopped asking after I told them about my parent's death.'It took damn so long to get here.'I felt all the emotions I had bottled up in the tower trying to spill out.But there wasn't any time to look back and reminisce.\u201cI see you've arrived early Han Sungyeun-nim.\u201dI slowly turned around at the sound of the familiar voice.A man with a crew cut, wearing a gray coat, and distinctively sharp eyes stood there.I knew that man.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cIt's been a while, manager Hwang Manho.\u201dThe man, the legend, my fast pass.He rubbed on his luxury watch and faked a smile.\u201c\u2026Haha, it hasn't been that long.\u201d\u201cI guess it just feels like a long time because I've been through some strange things lately.\u201d\u201c\u2026Strange things?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dHwang Manho seemed curious as to what those events were.I mean, I guess that's the normal response.\u201cHe's probably wondering why I'm so insistent on taking this exam now.\u201dBut it'd be way more fun to not tell him.It might sound a little petty but I had no plans to be kind to this man.Especially with all the disrespect I'd been getting the past few years.I knew exactly what kind of person I was.I wasn't so petty that I'd go eye for an eye to exact revenge on everyone who's wronged me.But I'm not so compassionate as to pretend that none of it ever happened.That's the reason I didn't feel much guilt when I killed those challengers in the Tower of Trials.Hwang Manho noticed that I had no intention of telling him anything and moved on.\u201cWell, I guess that's not important right now. You said you wanted to take the exam right?\u201d\u201cYeah. If you help me, I'll call it even with the money.\u201d\u201cSure. As long as that's settled.\u201dAs if he knew the results wouldn't change.\u201cAh, and the only part you can override is the theoretical written exam and the interview. That's okay with you right?\u201dThat's the only reason I asked.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cThen let's go in. I already made the necessary arrangements.\u201dHe started walking into the hunter association building.\u201cThis is Hwang Manho from the White Lotus training center. I'm here as Han Sungyeun applicant's observer.\u201d\u201cAlright. Just a second.\u201dI guess he didn't lie about the arrangements.After speaking to the front desk employee, a middle-aged man in a suit with a deadpan face came out from the back.\u201cHello, I'm Kim Inhoo and I'll be your examiner for today.\u201dA face I'd never seen before.'I guess having him as an observer has its benefits.'It looked like he was a high-ranking officer and not just a normal examiner.I had heard that the examiners for exams who are sponsored by famous centers or guild executives weren't ordinary examiners.That they're veteran hunters who are fit to lead the front lines.Seeing as they're so experienced, there's very little room for error in their evaluations.'Of course, that's not the only thing they might be there to do.'I guess that's good though.It'd be shitty to receive a lower rank just because of a bad examiner.Kim Inhoo took a quick glance at me and turned back to Hwang Manho.\u201cAre you here as a sponsor as well? Or just an observer.\u201dI knew exactly what that meant.Typically, guild executives can accompany candidates into their exams as observers.And if they decide to be a sponsor, it means they'll give all the support that candidate needs to grow.Consequently, the hunter association will give them an easier test so they have more room to show off.But none of that applied to me.\u201cNo, I'm here purely as an observer.\u201dKim Inhoo nodded and continued to speak in a monotone voice.\u201cI see. Then let's go to the examination site. Follow me.\u201dUpon following the big man in the suit, a familiar scene came into sight.Beyond a giant glass wall, one could see a white, rectangular stone chamber.The examiner and the observers watched from here, and the candidate fought in there.Nothing had changed from the last time I'd been here.Kim Inhoo turned to me and broke the silence.\u201cDo you need an explanation on the practical exam?\u201d\u201cNo, I don't need one.\u201d\u201cThen please select a difficulty from 1 to 10.\u201dThis pearly chamber could virtually emulate a chosen monster.Of course, there were some limitations since this thing runs on a mana device.'But it should be able to emulate up to a D rank monster.'Previously, I'd only ever taken the exam at level 1.But I lost to the goblin every time.Why?'Because I was weak.'I failed because I couldn't even beat a goblin without a life-or-death battle.More accurately, they failed me right before the life-or-death part started.It made sense since they couldn't let the candidates die.I'd have probably beaten the goblin if I did risk my life to kill him.But\u2014'Someone like that can't be a hunter.'You can't call yourself a hunter if you can barely kill a goblin.Hunters were the kinds of people who'd always be able to maintain a superior position.At least, that's what they told me the 17 times I failed.It wasn't like that in the Tower of Trials.'Anything goes as long as you stay alive.'But thanks to that, I knew the extent of my limits.The tower was cruel but fair to all of its participants.No matter how bitter the trial was, the reward was always sweet.Due to that, the me who beat the sand golem was able to beat the orc.And I was able to grow even stronger from there.I wasn't the same weak player I used to be.After a brief moment of silence, I confidently stated my answer.\u201cI'll go with level 10.\u201d____MC only failed the test 17 times?Those are rookie numbers____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Not bad.'You could consider it the best starting placement for hunters because it normally took quite a while to get to that point.Of course, that meant the exam would be that much harder.But I was more excited than nervous.I wondered what they were building up so much anticipation for.'It won't be something as ridiculous as the doppelganger.'I could barely bring myself to smile after remembering it's near-C-rank combat abilities.The 1v1 on the third floor left quite an impression on me.But I think I'd be able to beat the doppelganger pretty easily in my current state.'At least if it's a one-on-one environment.'I'd probably have some trouble if there were around 4 of them.They did have a lot of features like physical damage resistance and shapeshifting.On the other hand, I'd be able to handle almost any monster as long as it was around that level.The hunter association probably wouldn't be able to emulate anything too difficult though.'Now, I just have to pick a weapon.'I examined the wall of weapons to the right.And ended up picking the most comfortable two.\u300c Pure Silver Guild's Mass-produced Steel Sword \u300d\u300c Grade: F \u300d\u300c A sword manufactured by pouring decent quality steel into a mold. \u300d\u300c It is well balanced and does not dull easily. \u300dFirst, I picked the item that said 'mass-produced.'There wasn't anything much better than this and it was also the closest to my obsidian dagger.It was almost insulting to compare the dagger sitting in my room to this trash but\u2014'Well, the length of the blade is similar at least.'Then I picked up one of the shields close by.It was a rectangular steel shield that was weaker than my wooden shield.\u300c Pure Silver Guild's Mass-produced Steel Shield \u300d\u300c Grade: F \u300d\u300c A shield manufactured by pouring decent quality steel into a mold. \u300d\u300c It is quite heavy but has no other pros and cons. \u300dEven the Crude Dwarf Shield was better than this.I didn't want to use them even if it was just for the test.Especially because there were at least E-rank items the last time I took the test.'Is this what happens if you pick the 10th level?'There wasn't any information on it because I'd never met anyone who had taken a level 10 test.The mechanical voice broke my train of thought.\u300c The exam will begin in 30 seconds. \u300d\u300c Please finish your preparation. \u300d3 minutes had passed by in no time.I guess it didn't matter.I was confident that I could take on any monster, wherever they came from.'That's where they're coming from.'I let out a smirk looking at the small black circle in the center of the room.Normally, I'd have been so nervous that I'd barely be able to breathe.That's how I felt on the lowest level exam, but I didn't feel a thing now.'I guess this is growth.'\u300c The exam is beginning. \u300d\u300c Please hunt the flame bird. \u300dI squinted at the bright burst of flame that appeared in the center of the room.It was a monster I'd seen in the hunter handbook.\u201cThe flame bird, a D-rank monster. 'Its difficulty varied wildly depending on how you fought it.As the name suggested, the bird had almost no resistance to water and all types of magic attacks.The problem is that it's impossible to beat with just physical attacks.It's like telling a child to kill a goblin after giving him a stick.This seemed irrationally difficult but\u2026'\u2026I guess level 10 exams are just like this.'It made sense if they started you off as a D-rank hunter.The flame enveloped bird let out a chilling shriek.\u201cKwaaaaak\u2026!\u201d\u300c Due to the skill 'Predator's Roar,' your movements are now 25% slower. \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksMy body stiffened like my joints had rusted.It wasn't as restricting as the one that challenger used in the 4th trial.This skill was a couple of levels below that.'A more direct attack would have been better.'Then I'd be able to diminish its effects with physical attack resistance.I could ignore it if I tried, but it was still annoying.It was like I was walking through a swamp.I paused for a second to think of a way to deal with this flying beast.According to the handbook, close-range combatants are supposed to beat it using mana resistance but\u2026That wasn't possible for me because I didn't have any skills associated with it.\u201cI did want to test out my new skill, this is great'Crack!I pushed down on the white stone and circulated mana all over my body.This skill could put a lot of strain on my body.\u201cInstant Acceleration.\u201d\u300c Activating the skill 'Instant Acceleration.' \u300dAs the words left my mouth, I felt my entire body lighten like a feather.The effect was more holistic, and stronger than what you could get from the assassin's cloak.Then\u2014Kwaaaaang!Stone particles flew from where I had stood as I flew off into the air.About 10m up in the air, the perfect distance to land a blow on the dusty bird\u2026I swung the sword in my hand and\u2014'It's over.'Sleeet!The bird was split cleanly in two.The announcements didn't miss a beat.\u300c The exam is over. \u300d\u300c Congratulations. \u300d\u300c Candidate Han Sungyeun's final evaluation is C. \u300dI spent 7 years trying to pass this exam.And the end couldn't have been more anticlimactic.A man watching through the glass wall was furious.Kwaang!\u201c\u2026No, fuck, what the fuck!\u201dThe man smashing the wall to express his anger was Hwang Manho.He couldn't begin to even understand what had just happened in front of his eyes.The man who had only been a trainee somehow killed a D-rank flame bird.In the instant that it was summoned as well.Was that possible?'No, it's not possible.'Han Sungyeun was the worst player he'd ever seen.Not to mention that he had nothing remotely related to mana resistance.The trash player who couldn't even unlock his innate ability.That was Han Sungyeun.'Fuck, how did this even\u2026'There was no earthly explanation for what just happened.Hwang Manho directed his anger towards the man standing next to him.\u201c\u2026Can you explain what just happened here?\u201d\u201c\u2026I'm speechless, is this really a player who hasn't even debuted?\u201d\u201cDon't play dumb with me.

As you said, this was designed to be impossible for Han Sungyeun.\u201dThey were planning to give him a monster one rank above whatever he initially picked.That's what Hwang Manho requested and they accepted.He was a valuable pipeline that provided a lot of new hunters, so they had no choice but to accept.But the situation had changed.\u201cFirst, he picked the highest possible level, so the initial plan wasn't plausible. Then he obliterated that exam on his own. How is that my problem?\u201d\u201cAnd we even sent out the monster that he was most unsuited to fight.\u201d\u201cBut\u2014 The bastard is\u2026\u201d\u201cAs the announcement said, he'll receive a C-rank hunter license.\u201d\u201cI mean, can't you lower it a bit?\u201d\u201cHow do you even lower this? He beat the exam in 10 seconds. If he'd gotten a D-rank evaluation, we would have refuted it.\u201d\u201cDamn it.\u201dHe had to swallow his anger because they were right.'He's going to start off as a C-rank hunter\u2026'Hwang Manho retired as a C-rank hunter back in the day.He'd quit because his talents never took him further, and hard work had never been his strong suit.That's why Han Sungyeun bothered him so much.It was like looking at all the work he'd never done.And that's why he'd always left him alone without teaching him properly.'Fucking shit\u2026!'He was officially a hunter now.And a very promising one at that.Han Sungyeun would probably only get bigger and bigger.It was then\u2014\u201cYou don't look so well.

Would you be interested in working exclusively as a hunter for the hunter association?\u201dIt was out of the blue, but it didn't come as a surprise.To Kim Inhoo, I must be a diamond in the rough.'No associations, completely undiscovered.'I was probably one of a kind.Most young promising hunters were sponsored by big guilds.So, the hunter association couldn't poach any of those rising stars.'But I'm not from any guild nor am I affiliated with any group.'He even confirmed that I had a bad relationship with my only connection, Hwang Manho.There was no reason for them not to try to poach me.And this wasn't a bad deal.'hunter association hunters receive a salary even if they don't do anything.'Unlike most hunters who make their living by scavenging through dungeons, these hunters escort or arrest for a living.Protecting famous celebrities or arresting fugitive hunters, that's what they did.In reality, you'd do that for extra pay.'You don't have to do anything as long as you respond to their calls at specific times.'But even then, their salaries were ridiculously high.I put the license in my wallet and snuck in a question.\u201cExactly how much would the pay be?\u201d\u201cIt starts off at 1 million, but you can negotiate for more.\u201dThat's fairly high, even in this industry.An incredible amount for essentially doing nothing.\u201cThat's pretty good.\u201d\u201cWell, I think you have the potential to be worth it.\u201dKim Inhoo didn't even bat an eye at that amount.'Hmm, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't interested.'It'd be very worth it considering the time I'd spend in the tower.But\u2014'It's a bit iffy if they previously had a relationship with Hwang Manho.'The hunter industry is incredibly corrupt.A lot of murders happen within the dungeons.To the point where there are hunters who exclusively neglect corpses in dungeons.If you put a body in a dungeon that needed to disappear, no one could ever track you.And just like how the hunter industry had a dark side, the hunter association wasn't all clean.There were a lot of instances of candidates paying absurd sums of money to be evaluated at a higher rank.'In that aspect, Kim Inhoo was suspicious as well.'They probably tried to mess with my test.'It was actually different from the tests I took before.'To be honest, there was something that felt a bit off about this exam.Everything from the available items to how incompatible I was with the monster.I'd heard that a candidate who took a level 7 exam got D-grade weapons, but I only had F-grade available.And how most melee combatants would never be able to beat the flame bird.I didn't say anything because I assumed the level 10 test was special but\u2014'There's a lot to be suspicious of.'If that was the case, it would be foolish of me to accept this offer.Fool me once, shame on them. Fool me twice, shame on me.Of course, I didn't have any concrete proof.I still couldn't say if an immediate response was a wise decision.\u201cThank you for the offer. I'll think about it.\u201d\u201cIf it's because of the salary, you can negotiate it up.\u201d\u201cNo, it's not like that. Just some personal reasons.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see. Feel free to call any time.\u201dHe made a disappointed face and held out a business card.\u300c Hunter Association Examiner Kim Inhoo \u300d\u201cGive me a call when you feel like it.\u201dI took the card and nodded.\u201cAlright. I'll head out now.\u201d\u201cWe hope to keep a good relationship with you.\u201d'Exclusive hunter for the hunter association, huh.'I'd consider it for a bit longer, but there were still things I had to do.'Now that I have a license, I can start selling items.'I needed to get more out of the 3 days I had.'The return stone is cheaper than expected, so there's probably a bunch of us here.'That might affect the market price of my items.The tower would eventually let the challengers go, and they'd all have items with them.Whether that was good or bad, it'd change the market.I'd have to act quickly to prepare for that.\u201cLet's make some money first.\u201dI could probably charge some extra premium for my items.I'd need some money to prepare to go to the tower.This would be the first thing I'd do as a hunter.____Translator's notes \u2013MC: I just broke up a 5 year relationshipEveryone: omg are you okay?MC: yeah, it wasn't mine____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I'll just take care of it here.\u201dThere's no real reason for me to go to a different office.Unlike normal, markets where anyone can come and go, hunter markets were very restricted.

was to the point of it feeling much easier than the 4th trial.'The tower definitely isn't giving me a freebie.'Not the tower that I'd experienced so far.Why?Before I could reason an answer, an object at my feet interrupted my train of thought.Tap.\u201cWhat the hell is this\u2026\u201dThe object was nothing other than a wolf corpse.'Was it a fight for territory or something?'Beasts fought each other all the time, so it was understandable.In situations like these, most hunters would wait until the last second to reap the benefits of all the kills.It was a situation I could understand.The problem was that this was happening in the tower and not a dungeon.Why would they lower the difficulty at this point when it would make sense for them to raise it?\u201cI got a bad feeling about this.\u201dJust to make sure, I stopped for a second to more closely examine the corpses.And\u2014\u201cSword marks?\u201dI could see a clean cut right through the wolf's torso.'Someone stabbed it in the heart to kill it in one shot.'Clean and precise swordsmanship\u2014 it was clearly done by another entity.'This changes everything.'There was someone else in this cave other than me.It shouldn't be possible, but it was the only explanation.'Low-tier monsters like goblins wouldn't be able to make this clean of a cut\u2026'Whatever did this was a human or a monster with near-human

The restrictions are so strong.\u201dThis had been on my mind for a while but\u2014 why was he like this?The way he talked to himself mid-battle.Very inefficient.'Is he just a narcissist?'He could be lying about the 'restrictions' but\u2026I didn't think he was smart enough to say these things just to throw me off.\u201cI'm getting serious now, primitive.\u201dHe pulled his blade to his waist and stood it up vertically.This might be preparation for a skill.Koong.His blade strutted forward as he stepped off the floor.A swing from a distance that would never reach me.I'd experienced something like this on the third trial.Koonphh!The tip of his sword extended with a swift noise.I twisted my torso in response, and it barely skimmed past my ribs.Slash.\u201cKhmm.\u201dA small moan slipped out with the injury.\u300c Activating skill 'Accelerated Regeneration.' \u300dThe newly ranked-up skill got rid of the scratch instantly, but the aching pain still lingered.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'He was underestimating me for a reason.'I scowled at his sword, which was back to its original strength.There was a reason why the system evaluated him so highly.\u201cWatch carefully, twinkle toes. You'll die otherwise.\u201dThe black knight playfully presumed his stance again, as if he was playing a game.Like a child stepping on one ant at a time.That's exactly how he viewed me.'Fucking bastard.'This was what he did after walking into a stranger's trial?I almost let my anger get the best of me, but I had to simmer it down.Calmly, I had to think of what could rectify this situation\u2026Whoosh!His blade swung at me again before I could finish that thought.I was able to dodge it without being hit this time, but the swordsman was still confident.\u201cOh, aren't you a speedy one? Not bad for a 5th floor challenger.\u201dI couldn't afford to give him a snarky response.I had to reveal a little more of my strength.'I was saving instant acceleration as a last resort, but I can still use this.'There was a reason why I didn't sell the assassin's cloak at the hunter's market.\u300c Using the Assassin's Cloak(C)'s active ability. \u300d\u300c Movement speed +15% \u300d\u300c Activation time left \u2013 00:00:59 \u300dThis was the reason.Koong.The distance between us closed as I pushed off the floor.Of course, the knight seemed to have expected this and didn't panic.\u201cClosing the distance\u2026 Do you think you'd stand a chance then?\u201dThe sword in his hand followed a clean but destructive path.Ssssp!I was definitely ahead of him in terms of strength and speed, but his attacks were disproportionately fast.The aura surrounding his sword was definitely not an ordinary skill.'What the\u2026!'Voosh\u2026!The shield attached to my arm split in half and an extreme wave of pain jolted through it.I pulled back when his sword was about halfway through my arm, before he could get to the bone.Kwang!As he saw me tripping backward, the knight continued to smirk.\u201cOh no, it would have been less painful if the arm was cut off clean.\u201dI ignored the offender and pushed down on the cut as hard as I could with my right arm.The extreme agony made me want to scream out, but it soon soothed itself.\u300c The skill 'Pain Resistance' is active now. \u300d\u300c All forms of pain the user feels will be reduced by 15% \u300d\u300c The skill 'Sustain Battle' is active now. \u300d\u300c All restrictions on the user will be weakened. \u300dThe two skills grounded me from the pain.I had to stay calm, especially at times like these.After pushing the cut down for a bit, Accelerated Regeneration was already starting to reattach my arm.Maybe what was considered 'life-threatening' became more lenient with the rank up.I wasn't sure but I was regaining my cool after my injuries started to heal.\u201cHaha, you have some interesting skills.\u201dAs he made light of the situation, my head was clearer than ever.I wasn't sure what skill he used, but the aura surrounding his sword was dangerous.'\u2026It must be a skill related to cutting force.'The skill probably increased cutting force with mana reinforcement.Those kinds of skills were pretty rare besides the weapon skills but\u2026I had heard that they exist.Although there was never any information about the aura being this ominous.'Whatever it is, it's not something I can deal with at my level.'This was the result of me 'dealing' with it.The shield I spent a fortune on was in two pieces and my arm was almost cut off.'\u2026I'm only alive because of the cloak.'If I was any slower, my head would have been the one cut off.'I guess there's no way around this.'I wriggled my left arm back and forth and glared at the black knight.His skills were definitely threatening.'But as far as the stats go, I'm still a little ahead.'Then there was only one way to kill this madman.I moved my hands quickly to activate necromancy.\u300c Permanently increasing your stats using the souls. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 2. \u300d\u300c Agility increased by 3. \u300d\u300c Stamina increased by 3. \u300d\u300c Mana increased by 5. \u300d\u300c Tenacity increased by 7. \u300dThe knight seemed to notice this change in my body and laughed it off.\u201cPhysical strengthening, fun.\u201dAs though he knew I'd be powerless against him no matter what I did.I checked the time left on the assassin's cloak and got ready to go in.My left arm was basically healed and my stats were higher than ever.'This is the best I can do\u2026'Only one thing left.\u201cInstant Acceleration.\u201dMana left my body and took the weight of my body along with it.This was on another level from any of the other skills I'd used.The knight also twitched, as if he knew something just changed.\u201cHow does a damn primitive have so many skills\u2026\u201dAs he muttered to himself again, the knight got up on the tips of his feet.Like a compressed spring, I exploded forward at a speed as I'd never seen before.\u201c\u2026Fucking primitive!\u201dThe black knight wrapped himself in a red shroud of energy.I didn't know what exactly he did, but his movements also got faster.Though that wasn't enough to catch up to me.Not with all the bonuses from the cloak and skills.The knight's blade passed me at a hair's length, and I stuck my foot out.CHANG!The sound of the foot and the armor clashing rang throughout the cave.The knight caught himself right before stumbling to his knee.I couldn't help but smile at the sign of his weakness.He also seemed to have lost his playfulness.'That means he's considering me a threat now.'If I could take advantage of my speed again\u2026I wouldn't let him overpower me with whatever aura that was.If I could manage that\u2026'I have a chance of winning.'I could finally see the light.____Yall think he's abouta bring some aura back to the next group trial?____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I didn't realize the owner of this trial was a high ranker.\u201dI didn't expect his sudden approval, but I didn't pay much attention.\u201cI'll admit it. You're better than all the other primitives.\u201dThe only thing on my mind was how to take down the enemy in front of me.\u300c Time left \u2013 00:00:21 \u300dThe buff from the assassin's cloak was about to run out.I had to end this now.I gripped the sword in my hand and lunged forward.Instead of blocking the attack, he opted to swing his sword at me.Seeing that, I folded my torso into my legs to dodge the attack.Whoo-phew-! Kang\u2026!It was a one-sided exchange, but the result was disappointing.The black armor blocked my sword and rendered my attack useless.\u201cDid you think you could even scratch my armor with that flimsy sword?\u201dAs the embodiment of agility, it wasn't too hard to dodge all of his attacks.The only problem was\u2026'Even if my attacks hit, it won't get through his armor.'That was the biggest problem.The enemy had a skill that could split my shield, but I didn't have anything like that.Now was not the time to sound weak.\u300c Time left \u2013 00:00:16 \u300dI was about to lose the upper hand.But it wasn't like I had nothing.'I didn't waste all my points on this weapon for a reason.'There was no time to hesitate since I had no other options.As I was about to pour all my mana into my feet\u2014\u201cInsolent.\u201dThe black knight's sword was encased with a red aura.Phuaa\u2026!The violently dancing aura was even more dangerous than before.\u201cI'm going to split you in two.\u201dChills spread down my neck before I remembered that I had to keep moving.'Fuck.'Just as he said, his sword could slice through me like a hot knife through butter.I was risking my life to just land a meaningless blow, while a single attack from him could mean the end of me.The black knight also seemed to acknowledge this as he charged in without hesitation.'He was talking about underestimating me before but it's probably a load of bullshit.;He wouldn't be charging at me like this if he believed I could get through his armor.That's why it was more important than ever to fight.Whoosh! Kang! Crack! Voosh!With every swing he made, the walls split and the floors echoed.Thanks to the energy around his sword, even just a scrape of his sword was enough to engrave the walls.'Is this the aura that the Eye of Truth was talking about?'I had no idea who allowed this, but he was slicing through the hardened cave walls like tofu.I could emulate it if I'd wanted to, but it wouldn't be as smooth as this.\u201cHahaha, run as much as you'd like! You won't last long like this!\u201dA monster among monsters.My body seemed to move faster knowing that one wrong move could lead to my doom.The ease at which he seemed to move suggested that he had no problems with keeping this up for the near future.Clang! Chang! Kaang!No matter how hard I swung, the armor didn't even scratch, and the knight became more and more haughty.He stopped hesitating and staying wary of my attacks, instead opting to use flashier and bigger skills with a lot of blind spots.And that was my only path to victory.One, two, three, four\u2026I landed an increasing number of blows on his armor, and by the time that number hit double digits\u2014Vuaaaa\u2026!A blinding ball of light condensed at the edge of the blade and exploded.It wasn't just light but an explosive ball of electricity.\u201cWhat the f\u2014!\u201dThe knight finally realized and tried retreating but\u2026\u300c Thunder Blade \u300d\u300c Attacking with this weapon has a 10% chance to inflict an 'electrocute' effect. \u300dIt didn't matter since it was already too late to step back.I was a little nervous because it wasn't activating as soon as I had expected, but the explosion of lightning assured me\u2014Kraaaang!That I'd be the victor of this battle.\u201cG-ghaaaa\u2026.!\u201dI clicked my tongue as the knight laid on the ground, twitching.Whatever dimension he came from, he wasn't immune to electricity.'It would have been a pain in the ass if he had any resistance to it.'I bet my life on that, and I won.\u201cTsk, I was so close to dying.\u201dI swung like crazy and only got the effect to activate once.'I wasn't that lucky to begin with, but this is a little ridiculous.'Maybe the 10% wasn't that accurate.Seeing how little it activated when I fought the wolves, it wasn't completely out of the picture.\u201cY-you basta\u2026 A mere p-primitive\u2026\u201dI heard a small mumbling from the floor.The paralysis must've been wearing off because he was desperately trying to grasp the floor.'He wouldn't have gone down this easily if he had something like sustain battle.'The only skill he really had was that aura.Maybe he wasn't even that strong of an opponent if you thought about it that way.'If he wasn't lying, he did say something about his skills being restricted.'Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

How did a fucking primitive\u2026!\u201d\u201cMaybe you were just weak. And stupid enough to blindly rely on that aura skill.\u201d\u201cNo fucking way\u2026 a 5th floor\u2026 against me\u2026!\u201d\u201cIt's about time we end this.\u201dI was also feeling a little tingly from the splash effect of the electricity but\u2026'Not enough to paralyze me.'I decided to end this while I still had the chance.'I want to keep asking him questions but that could be dangerous.'I stood above his head, ready to strike my blade down.\u201cW-wait, I can answer any questio\u2014\u201d\u201cNo thanks, I don't care.\u201dI stabbed the blade into his head while his mouth was still open.Clean and swift.After shoving my sword through a space between his helmet and jiggling it around, he finally stopped moving.I felt like I was becoming more and more desensitized to killing someone but\u2026'It's not bad.'Feeling guilty every time I had to kill someone would pose its own threats.\u300c Congratulations. You have overcome the Tower of Trials floor 5. \u300dThe popup message confirmed my kill.And\u2014Sssst\u2026The knight's body completely disintegrated and poured out from the armor.The otherworldly knight had died and couldn't harm me anymore.A wave of relief flushed over me after confirming my safety.The necromancy mark wasn't there, but that didn't disappoint me.My survival was enough of a reward right now.\u201cGod damn, that was close.\u201dIf I hadn't purchased the thunder blade before\u2026The process wouldn't have been as easy as it was.I would've needed to use everything in my arsenal and would've spent some more time rolling in the dirt.Good thing I also increased my stats right then.Of course, this didn't get rid of all the entangled thoughts in my head.Everything, from other dimensions to intrusions, was fleeting around my head.It was difficult to grasp these things because I didn't even realize they had existed until now.But I gave up and put on a smile.\u201cYeah, it would be weirder if the place was more normal.\u201dIt would be arrogant of me to assume that I'd be able to understand what this tower was doing.'Maybe I've been too satisfied recently.'As dangerous as that was, I still learned a lot from that.Especially that no matter how strong I got, my life would always be in danger.'I thought I was already being careful in my own right, but I better step it up.'Eh, I guess I got a little nugget of wisdom, if you could call it that.'\u2026I have something to ask once I get to the 8th floor.'Like what the hell other dimensions were and some more details on the whole intrusion thing.The tower is a black box system and the only way to navigate it is through the questions they allow us.Now is not the time to use them yet.It wouldn't be too late to scope out the situation until the 8th floor before choosing to ask a question.Still deep in thought, I noticed something strange out of the corner of my eye.Where were the reward messages that should be filling my view?\u201cWhat the\u2014\u201dI scrunched my face in confusion at a message I'd never seen before.\u300c The difficulty of the trial is not proportional to the reward. \u300d\u300c Recalibrating the rewards. \u300d\u201cWhat are they saying\u2026\u201dThey were going to change my reward after I went through this whole ordeal?I could smell the corruption from here.There would be nothing worse than the quality of the rewards going down.\u300c Recalibrated. \u300d\u300c Awarding the rewards. \u300dCouldn't they just give me what they promi\u2026\u300c As a reward, you have received the skill 'Triple Laceration ().' \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received '7,500 points.' \u300d\u300c As a bonus reward, you have received 3,500 points.' \u300d\u300c Please move to the waiting area. \u300d\u300c Moving to the waiting room. \u300dI froze in place after reading the messages in front of me.\u201cUh, umm.\u201dThe reward was exchanged from a C- item to an skill.Comparing them was an insult to the skill.My anger melted away as I saw 11,000 points and an rank skill.\u201c\u2026This is more like the tower of trials.\u201dThis was what I wanted to see.____MC: May I speak to the manag-Manager: Yes?MC: I just wanted to comment on the wonderful work you were doingSucks that he didn't get to suck him____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

through my rewards, but there was something I had to take care of before that.'I should do this first.'The Covert Hunter's Shield that was destroyed by the knight in the 5th trial had to be repaired.'Hm, it feels like a waste because I can only use it once, but that's why I bought it.'Better use it now than die saving it.The shield was just small enough to fit in the box.I activated it

astonished at the flawless shield.\u201cDamn\u2026\u201dIt was definitely worth the money I spent on it.The Covert Hunter's Shield was worth more than whatever the box cost.'If I could sell it back to Earth, I could get at least 2 repair boxes for it.'There was no use in regretting it now anyway.If I could keep repairing these kinds of items and selling them back on Earth\u2026'It could be a profitable business.'Then I activated the cleansing stone to freshen up.Whooof\u2026A gust of wind wrapped around my body and evaporated the dry wolf blood from my skin.It felt a little lavish to have it just for comfort but\u2026After using it, it didn't really feel like a waste of money.'There's a bare minimum of how a human being should act.'Staying comfortable wasn't a waste.Now, let's see what

skill related to cutting force\u2026\u201dIt must have been similar to the aura skill that the knight was using.Maybe it was because it's an skill, but the system had more details about the skill.The system explained the details almost as if it was an innate ability.More importantly, the proficiency for this skill was 0%.That meant, unlike the Eye of Truth, this skill could be ranked up.'I was wondering what to do after the daggermanship skill maxes out\u2026'This skill could be a good addition to that one.Of course, that was still only a temporary fix.'They said that I could even buy skills after reaching the 8th floor, so I should be fine.'It wasn't something I should worry about at the moment.After coming to that conclusion, I checked out my stats.\u300c Han Sungyeun

You guys aren't even human, fucking animals.DarkKnight: Fuck off, are you going to take responsibilty when someone kills me?IWannaEatChocoPie: You've definitely killed someone if you passed the 4th trial. Stop pretending to be innocent.OrangeMushroom: Lmao ikr, you think we actually enjoy killing people? We're just trying to survive.TheresASpaceBehindTheColumn: Are you a dumbass? The achievements are the most cost-efficient method right now.IDunnoYet: Who knows, maybe he got carried through that trial.TangerineNoodles: I'm an idiot for even trying to talk to you fucking animals.HuntingAddict: Lol, you might as well get it now because you'll need it for the 6th trial too.This wasn't normal.They were trying to justify whatever they were doing by saying it was efficient or some other bullshit, but that wasn't the problem.\u201cThis is straight-up psychopathic.\u201dI scowled at the continued onslaught of messages.Of course, I knew exactly why these transactions consisted of this.The 6th trial must force you to kill someone.And you could probably make a big profit if you had any information related to that.Selling the other achievements might be crazy, but those related to fighting other challengers were eventually bound to be discovered.'\u2026This is bad, even if all the high rankers already passed this trial.'This was beyond killing just to survive.They were trying to squeeze every last thing they could from this.And they were encouraging others to do the same by offering information.\u201c\u2026Doesn't look like anyone's met challengers from another world.\u201dAnd even if they had, I'd be releasing too much information by asking about it publicly.'Nothing worse than getting these freaks' attention.'I'll just observe the current situation.Frog: I just got here from the 5th trial. What's so good about psychological resistance skills?HuntingAddict: It's like pain or normal resistance skills. You just take in less damage mentally.OrangeMushroom: If you have psychological resistance skills, you don't feel a lot of pain even when committing murder, so it's easier to make a logical decision.Frog: Can anyone tell me the details on the damage reduction percentages?DarkKnight: Starting from 10% at F-grade, it goes up to 12% at E, and 15% at D. At least from my experience.Frog: I see\u2026 Thank you for the information.HuntingAddict: Hit me up if you need one. I'll tell you how you can learn it for a cheap price.KnowItAll: You'll be seeing a lot of things like this as time goes on. Might as well learn one now.I guess it made sense that that's what everyone wanted these skills for.Those resistances might sound enticing at first, but it was a double-edged sword.There would definitely be a problem if you constantly pushed your psychological pain off onto a skill.'It's known to make you more level-headed but\u2026'That could be fatal in a place like the tower, where you have to go through life-threatening trials day after day.The fact that you essentially feel no emotional pain without any choice\u2026It could be enticing to those with a weak mentality, but things could turn out badly if you used it to justify everything that you do.This chat was living proof of that.I think I finally saw the dark side of the tower.Some people might see this tower as a brand new chance but\u2026To others, the tower has taken everything.The lower-ranked challengers left on the 5th floor were showing me the reality.'I must have never known since I'd always entered the trials as soon as they were ready.'Maybe the same conversations were repeating on the lower floors.But I had no right to be angry at the tower.If I had never entered the tower and stayed in the outside world instead\u2026'I'd be in a much worse situation than these people.'The world has always worked like this.The winners take everything, and the losers get nothing.'Who, then, would hesitate?'If I had to step over someone to get stronger, I'd gladly do so.I wouldn't sympathize or scrutinize these challengers anymore.Frog: Can I buy that information from you?HuntingAddict: Of course. As long as you have some points for me.OrangeMushroom: There's also a bunch of relevant achievements so let me know if you're interested.DarkKnight: Murder or whatever. I'm looking for something that's gonna help me with the next trial.SnowmanChief: I just came from the 5th trial. What's going on?Everyone was my competition and I wasn't here to determine who's wrong and who's right.I'd just observe.What these challengers were preparing and how they'd use it.It'd be easier to deal with them if I knew what they were up to.Information is power.\u300c Floor 6 trial starting in \u2013 1hrs 12min \u300dUnlike the other trials, there wasn't much I could do to prepare for this one.I was past the point of getting used to my stats and equipment.I might've kept training in the past but\u2026That was beneath me now.'Once you reach my level of sensitivity, you could instantly get accustomed to higher stats.'Of course, I wouldn't waste time doing nothing.I was collecting information.Tkfdlsrhkd: I killed a teammate during the 4th trial and got the achievement 'Betrayer.' I gained +1 strength from it.LetMeLive: Anyone with psychological resistance skills, look into murder-related achievements. You can get a lot from killing people in different ways.IiIiIIiIIi: If your teammate even shows a little possibility of being a troll, just kill them. They won't get in your way later and you'll even get an achievement out of it.Parasite: Yall, did you know the person who spread the info about the 4th trial changed their name to 'Headygongdu'?ImMonster: That's that fucker's nickname? He wasted my question to the admins. I'm gonna fucking kill him if I meet him.BarksAtCrazyPpl: Trying to kill yourself? He was ranked B in the 5th trial and you barely even managed a D. How are you gonna kill him?There were people who shared achievements for free, and there were people who revealed information about others.There wasn't anything too informative there, but this was enough to come to a conclusion.\u201cYou can't trust anyone on the 6th trial.\u201dThere's a lot of crazy people here, huh?Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThis put that guy I met in the 4th trial, Lee Sunghoon, in a much better light.One thing I found out was more information about this 'Headygongdu' guy.'He's the guy who ruined the vibe on the 4th floor.'It must have been someone who stayed behind during the 4th trial to find out about the name change.Of course, I could find out more if I spent some points but\u2026'No point of wasting points talking to these people.'Especially since all the information being revealed was pretty trivial.Plus, I didn't want to become a public target like 'Headygongdu.'\u201cI'll stay away from saying anything in the chat.\u201dTime passed by while I was reading the chat and\u2014\u300c Do you accept the 6th floor trial? \u300dOf course, I accepted, and the blue portal materialized in front of my eyes.Voom\u2026!\u300c Entering Tower of Trials floor 6. \u300d\u300c Difficulty \u2013 Hard \u300d\u300c The objective of the following trial is 'conquering.' \u300d\u300c We wish the challenger a satisfactory ending to their choice. \u300dShaaa, shaaa.The sound of waves informed me of where I was before my eyes could recognize it.\u201c\u2026The ocean?\u201d\u300c The 6th floor trial is starting soon. \u300d\u300c Remaining time \u2013 50 minutes \u300d\u300c Trial success condition \u2013 Capture one of the surrounding tiles before the time runs out. \u300d\u300c Trial fail condition \u2013 Challenger's death or time out \u300d\u300c Trial success reward \u2013 Random Box (B) \u300d\u300c Trial fail penalty \u2013 Death \u300dIn the middle of an ocean that extended as far as the eyes could see, touching the sky at the horizon\u2026I was standing on a platform formed from tens and thousands of connected tiles.The scene was finally settling into my head.Contrary to the 5th trial, which was in a cave, the 6th trial was being conducted on the sea.On floating tiles too.'A little out of the blue, but what else could I expect from the tower.'It was then\u2014Voom, voom.A bunch of portals appeared on top of various tiles as the challengers began walking in.As a message popped up, portals on tiles adjacent to me opened up as well.\u300c Teams have been dispatched. \u300d\u300c Collaborate with your team and clear the trial. \u300dLike the 4th trial, I must have teammates on the 6th trial too.'Anyone's fine as long as they're not like Lee Sunghoon.'Just then.Shhhhk!A golden blade popped out of the portal and almost skimmed my nose.'What the\u2026!'I honestly didn't know how to react when a blade came out instead of the expected challenger.Contrary to my surprise, my body reacted automatically and stepped back to dodge the attack.Tup.I then grabbed the golden blade with my bare hands\u2014 Something I learned that I could do after reaching 43 on my tenacity.I found out that if I focused on not grabbing the blade too hard, I wouldn't get cut by even C-rank items.As such, I was pretty confident that none of the weapons that these lower-rankers had could cut me.\u201cH-huh??\u201dI heard a flustered voice through the portal as I calmly yanked the sword and\u2026Also pulled the man attached to it.Foop!\u300c 'Betrayer' achievement unlocked. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 1. \u300dBlood splattered through the holographic message.\u201cFucking shit.\u201dThe 6th trial was off to a rough start.____Hands up if you think someone is gonna whoop mc's ass cuz he thinks everyone is a low ranker____Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Or was this all calculated?Whatever it was, a normal person definitely wouldn't have swung a sword through the portal.He definitely had the intention of killing someone.\u201cDamn it.\u201dI didn't let my guard down.Teammates couldn't be trusted, and there were a lot of challengers equipped with psychological resistance.The problem wasn't that I let my guard down.'He really just took a stab in the dark hoping someone would die.'There was no way anyone could assume that something like that could happen from an empty portal.If it was anyone else, their heads would already be rolling on the floor by now.The only reason mine is still attached is because of my overwhelming stats.\u201c\u2026Why do I feel like this happens to me pretty often?\u201dI scowled at the corpse losing warmth at my feet.The challenger from the other world, my teammates from the 4th trial\u2026Why does it seem like I'm always getting the short end of the stick?I'm already down a teammate for the rest of the trial.'Worst case scenario already.'Any team with all teammates present would already have a leg up on me.'I should just scope out the other teams.'And when I turned my head with this realization\u2014I couldn't believe the sight in front of my eyes.\u201cHeehaaaha! It's an achievement! My strength really went up!\u201d\u201cDamn it, no one mentioned it being on water!\u201d\u201cP-please\u2026 S-save me. A p-potion\u2026\u201dScreams of agony came from every direction as blood splattered everywhere.Excitement, rage, surprise, despair, desire, regret, etc\u2026Various emotions echoed throughout an endless ocean in one simultaneous harmony.'\u2026I guess I don't have it that bad.'It looked like others had it far worse than I did.Like if hell existed, this might be it.\u201cEveryone's lost their minds\u2026\u201dThey weren't even looking at the trial's objective before jumping at each other for the achievements.Each murder was being carried out in its own unique and special way.They'd lost sight of the most important thing.'Conquering one of the four tiles.'It looked like they were fighting with a goal in mind.There were a couple of people huddling somewhere but\u2014\u201cDamn it! Your stats go down if you fall in the water, be careful!\u201d\u201cTh-the tile is moving too much\u2026 I can't balance myself!\u201d\u201cWaaaait! S-save me! I-I can't get up\u2026!\u201dIt didn't look like they were faring any better either.'Your stats go down when you fall in the water and the tile shifts every time you move.'I gathered information while watching some of the other contestants move around.Staying faithful to its origins, the Tower of Trials was full of dangers.Of course\u2026'Hey, this is easier than I thought.'It wasn't enough to impede my movements.Shaa, shaa!All you had to do was stay away from the water, and the shifting tiles didn't really bother me.If you took my stats into account, there was no way I could just lose my balance.Even the 5th trial was easier than this.Tap, tap, tap.The shifting movements of the tiles only made it easier to move in a rhythm.Even while I was riding the waves, most challengers still couldn't take their first steps.'If I reach the tile like this, will the trial just end?'Tap.I stepped onto the red tile on the edge as I continued to think and\u2026\u300c Starting to conquer the northern tile. \u300dIt wasn't as easy as I hoped it was.\u300c The conquering will pause when another team steps onto the tile. \u300d\u300c Your progress will not stop as long as another team doesn't step into the tile. \u300d\u300c Prevent the other teams from getting into this tile. \u300d\u300c Time left \u2013 9min 59 secs \u300d\u201cConquering\u2026\u201dI guess the only problem is.'The conquering requirement is a little fickle.'Standing my ground for 10 minutes in this chaos\u2026And it'll be so much harder since I'm alone.The only pro is that other teams have also lost a lot of members.I took a look around my surroundings and confirmed.'It's not impossible.'There wasn't anyone as skilled as the otherworldly traveler I saw in the last trial.Most of them couldn't even stand up straight.I was only nervous in the beginning because I started without a teammate.'Makes sense considering they've all gotten low evaluations on the 5th trial.'The high-rankers who passed the 5th trial ages ago were probably already above the 6th trial.Of course, there were probably people who used the return stone or had other reasons for coming up late.People like me.It was then\u2014\u201c\u2026Go north! The guy there is by himself!\u201dI felt the attention drawn in my direction as someone pointed at me.\u201cY-yeah! And he doesn't seem to be using any protection magic\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. He doesn't have a teammate. Maybe he's just trying to get achievements.\u201d\u201cFuck, what's the worst that can happen? Death? I'm going in!\u201dThere was a mixed bag of reactions, but most of them saw it as a tasty treat.The other challengers tiptoed towards me as I stared right back.\u201cHmm, I don't like the way this is going.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksOne person was enough to turn this chaos and direct it all towards me.'I guess there are politicians everywhere you go.'Just like that guy 'HeadyGongdu.'Just like the guy who turned everyone's attention towards me and slipped out the back.But I didn't have that many complaints about it.'Eh, I expected all of this to happen.'You could solve most problems in this tower with pure force.The five or so challengers in front of me didn't seem to be part of one team but\u2026They seemed to have recognized me as the common enemy and united to attack.They weren't even aware of the fact that they were being distracted, but I had no intentions of letting them know.'I needed a way to increase my necromancy proficiency anyway.'These competitive trials were like a special event for me.An extremely profitable event where I could train my innate ability and maybe even pick up some extra skills along the way.\u201cThis is what I'm talking about.\u201dI put on a faint smile as they rushed towards me.They looked like some tasty experience.To be honest, I didn't really have to kill all of them.All I had to do was keep them off for 10 minutes.I could've let them live if I really wanted to.They were all weak enough that I wouldn't have had much trouble doing so as well.And that could increase their chances of survival.But\u2014'I'd just be prolonging their misery.'Even if I send them to another tile, someone had to die.Whether you were defending or invading, only one side could survive.It wasn't my job to decide what was right and wrong\u2026Nor was it my job to feel pity for these lower-rankers.\u201cDie!\u201dThe invaders were swift and to the point.One of the men who got nearby lounged at me with a spear.The pursuing challengers took his lead to attack with their respective weapons.\u201cDamn it! If I'm gonna die either way! Heart Solidarity!\u201d\u300c Due to the innate ability 'Heart Solidarity' player 'Kim Jinhyun' and 'Han Sungyeun's pain will now be shared. \u300dKoong\u2026.!It felt like a heavy piece of copper fell on my heart and a message popped up.Sharing pain?'Is it another manbased innate ability?'Maybe it was because I didn't have any mana resistance skills but\u2026There was nothing I could do against these types of attacks.I could dodge or block it if it was a physical attack or something\u2026'I'll have to look into mana resistance stills later.'Even while my mind was focused on these topics, my body moved on its own.I grabbed the incoming spear with my left hand and jumped up to decapitate the attacker.Slash\u2026!\u300c 'One Punch Man' achievement unlocked. \u300d\u300c 'Contempt for the Weak (F)' skill generated. \u300dA message telling me something appeared, but I had no time to check it.'Three left now.'I couldn't be relieved with enemies still in front of me.I quickly stepped off the red tile and stepped to an adjacent one.Thankfully, one of the messages that showed up when I stepped on the red tile was this.\u300c Your progress will not stop as long as another team doesn't step into the tile. \u300dMy progress would continue as long as someone else didn't step on it.That meant I could move around freely without having to worry about the conquering progress.The longer they were alive, the more likely they were to try something.'I'll take care of them now while I still can.'\u300c Activating the skill 'Contempt for the Weak'. \u300d\u300c All five of the enemy's main stats are lower than yours. \u300d\u300c Enemies are more easily threatened by you and your strength goes up by 1. \u300dThe skill that I had just received activated and added more energy to my steps.The new skill was interesting, but I almost laughed out loud at the message I just saw.'Not a single one of their stats are higher huh\u2026'That meant they stood no chance against me, other than possible irregularities.\u201cWhat the fuck\u2026 How is he so strong\u2026!\u201d\u201cHoly sh\u2026\u201d\u201cFuck, stop him from moving! Aren't you a magician! Put up a shield!\u201d\u201cShut the fuck up, you think magic is omnipotent! How am I supposed to put up a shield on these tiles?!\u201dTap, tap, tap.Maybe it was because of the new skill, but the challengers were in a state of panic.I almost let out a sigh at how pathetic the challengers were.'If it was me, I would have tried using the water beneath us or moved on to a different tile.'I might have struggled a bit with the reduced stats but\u2026They were the ones being held down by the water.It was pathetic.'Well, whatever.'This wasn't where I was supposed to be anyway.I would have been on the higher floors with all of the other high rankers but\u2026I was just a little delayed from returning to Earth.If I wanted a bit more excitement\u2026'I have to climb higher.'Where the stronger challengers were, where the harder trials were.I'd never get stronger dealing with these assholes.If the tower rewarded its contestants fairly\u2026There was no way that this massacre would get me anything worthwhile.I had to get back to the front lines.And in order to do that\u2026\u201cI'll have to end these small fries.\u201dI've had enough of this trial now.____MC is in a bronze game as a challenger wondering why the teams are turning against each other________Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I think you're misunderstanding something, we can just give up on th\u2026\u201dI started moving before he could even finish talking.He hadn't even realized that he was revealing all his openings while he talked.I closed the distance in an instant and swung my sword lightly.\u201cWha\u2026\u201dThat was challenger Kim Jinhyun's lost words.Stt\u2014!'A misunderstanding, giving up\u2026 what a load of bullshit.'Would he have said those things if he was stronger than me?I could guarantee that he wouldn't have.\u201cUgh.\u201dPain spread through my neck to a suffocating degree, but I paid no attention.\u300c The skill 'Pain Resistance' is active now. \u300d\u300c All forms of pain the user feels will be reduced by 15% \u300dThe pain went away as quickly as it came.My neck was still aching and I felt like throwing up but\u2026Grip.It wasn't enough to affect me swinging this sword.\u201cH-holy shit. This guy is batshit crazy!\u201dThe people behind Kim Jinhyun started moving as soon as he fell.\u201cAlright, let's go, you bastard! Someone's gonna die here!\u201dHe held up his giant shield and rushed toward me because he knew I wouldn't let him retreat any further.His plan was probably to push me off the tile and get me in the water but\u2026That only worked if you could outmaneuver your enemy.'He's slow.'The number 54 next to my agility wasn't there just for show.Fssh!I slightly twisted my body to dodge his blitz and stuck my foot out.Tink.\u201cWooaah!\u201dThe challenger tripped on my leg, lost his balance, and fell flat on his face.Dashing forward on a floating tile, especially with those stats\u2026It was like he was begging me to kill him.And so I did.\u201cAhhhhhhh!\u201dMaybe it was because he was a big man with a fitting steel armor and shield but\u2014The challenger's body proceeded to slip straight into the ocean after falling.Ploop!\u201cBua\u2014 aghha\u2014 F-fuck! H-help m\u2026\u201dWith the reduction in his stats, he could barely even stay afloat.Crack!I ended his misery by shoving my sword into his barely floating head.\u300c 'Merciless Murderer' achievement unlocked. \u300d\u300c Agility increased by 1. \u300d\u201cUh, uuhhhhh\u2026\u201dThe magician in the back inched backward while shaking.He was worse than the two that preceded him.\u201cI-I\u2026 to d-different tile! P-please!\u201dSkt\u2026!The magician's head fell into the ocean as it slowly sank into the abyss.\u300c 'Cold-blooded Climber' achievement unlocked. \u300d\u300c Agility increased by 1. \u300d\u300c You have received 1,500 points.' \u300dSome people did mention that murder was the number one way to unlock more achievements.I just killed only three more people, but I acquired a bunch of achievements.'One Punch Man', 'Merciless Murderer', 'Cold-blooded Cilmber'.I'd already received three achievements from the 6th trial.I could tell why the other challengers were going crazy for it.If I could give up my humanity and just farm achievements\u2026'I'll get that many more achievements and grow that much stronger.'But I didn't want to be that bloodthirsty.I'll kill the ones who try to fight me but I didn't want to go any further than that.Because the results of throwing away your humanity were right in front of my eyes.\u201cI-I didn't do anything wrong\u2026 It's their fault for getting killed!\u201d\u201cHa\u2026 hahaha, I-I did it! Fuck, I'm alive!\u201d\u201cCrazy bastards, they literally just killed their teammates as well.\u201d\u201cLook at all these achievements\u2026 The trial is already worth it.\u201dThese despicable emotions were felt throughout the entire stage.The smell of blood mixed with the salty scent of the ocean passed me by in a refreshing breeze.Looking at the corpses on the tiles, it seemed like all the fights came to their own conclusions.\u300c Time Left \u2013 4 min 17 secs \u300dIt hadn't even been 10 minutes, yet most of the challengers were already dead.This happened earlier than I expected, but that's that.There was no way a proper fight could occur when most teams started off by killing each other.The teams that worked together ended up taking the win in the long run.Of course, there were still people trying to get the betrayer achievement at the end.The 6th trial brought upon a lot of things to ponder over.Mistrust of others, the reality of low-ranked challengers, the aura of despair throughout the tower\u2026But even after seeing all that, my thoughts didn't change.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksNo, seeing all of this strengthened my preexisting beliefs.'Let's not pretend to be innocent. I'll take everything I can get.'But I wouldn't kill people for no reason.If that's what the tower required from me to climb to higher floors?\u300c Time over. \u300d\u300c You have captured the northern tile. \u300d'I guess I have no choice then.'Even if it forced me to commit the horrific acts that I'd seen just now\u2026I'd do anything as long as my humanity remained intact.Only committing murder when necessary was my answer to all of this.\u300c Congratulations. You have overcome the Tower of Trials floor 6. \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received 'Random Box (B).' \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received '8,000 points.' \u300d\u300c Please move to the waiting area. \u300d'My head finally cleared up.'A refreshing feeling of all my concerns disappearing.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Lee Songjoon'. \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Kim Jinhyuk'. \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Song Jinook'. \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Han Sukjoon'. \u300dAnother message popped up after absorbing all of the nearby souls.\u300c Proficiency increased by 12% \u300d\u300c Innate ability 'Necromancy's' proficiency reached 100%. \u300d\u300c Innate ability 'Necromancy's' ranked up. \u300dMy innate ability ranked up.I had kind of expected this, so I wasn't too surprised about it.I moved the message to the side and made my way to the portal on the northern tile.\u300c Moving to the waiting room. \u300dTime to go back to my trusty waiting room.\u300c You have entered the 7th floor waiting room. \u300dAs empty as always.Well, it wasn't that important, but as I was about to step away\u2026\u300c The system expansion is starting. \u300dThe following message startled me wide awake.\u201c\u2026Wasn't the expansion scheduled for the 8th floor?\u201dThe unexpected message surprised me, but the system continued to notify me.\u300c List Achievements has been created. \u300d\u201cAh.\u201dI thought something important was going to happen, but it was just the achievements.Only a notification that I could now look at the achievements in more detail.There weren't any follow-up messages saying that anything changed.This shouldn't even count as an expansion.\u201cList achievements.\u201d\u300c Achievement List \u300d\u300c S Grade \u2013 The First Returnee \u300d\u300c A Grade \u2013 None \u300d\u300c B Grade \u2013 None \u300d\u300c C Grade

\u300d\u201c\u2026Not as many as I thought.\u201dThree of the six achievements are from the 6th trial.Which meant I hadn't gotten that much before that.'I guess you do get a lot from murdering others.'But the most important part was the S-grade achievement.\u201cJust as I thought, it wasn't a normal achievement.\u201dI had assumed that it was rare from the fact that it gave me an class skill but\u2026 wow.I couldn't believe I got something so good for just returning a little earlier than everyone else.A little sense of pride arose while looking through these achievements.I selected the 'One Punch Man' achievement and looked at the details.\u300c One Punch Man \u300d\u300c Grade: C \u300d\u300c An achievement for killing a challenger in one hit. \u300d\u300c Achievement generates 'Contempt for the Weak (F)' skill. \u300d\u201cOoh\u2026\u201dI was just guessing how I got these before but\u2026They seemed much less mysterious now that they explained everything.\u300c Endurer of Fire \u300d\u300c Grade: E \u300d\u300c An achievement for staying conscious in a painful fire. \u300d\u300c Achievement generates 'Heat Resistance (F)' skill. \u300d\u300c Cold-Blooded Climber \u300d\u300c Grade: D \u300d\u300c An achievement for killing at least five challengers. \u300d\u300c Achievement rewards 1,500 points. \u300d\u300c Merciless Murderer \u300d\u300c Grade: E

achievement for killing a challenger designated to be your teammate. \u300d\u300c Achievement rewards 1 strength point. \u300dI opened all the achievements that I was curious about.\u201cHm, is that it?\u201dI looked at a couple of other achievements, but there wasn't anything special.There wasn't anything more to the listing.'I guess all it does is show you more information about the achievements.'Slightly disappointed, I opened my inventory to check the trial.But\u2014\u300c Random Box \u300d\u300c Grade: B \u300d\u300c A box decorated with a red ribbon that generates a random item. \u300d\u300c Upon opening, you receive an item from F to B-grade. \u300d\u201cA random box, huh.\u201dThe 4th trial increased my stats by a bit, but this reward was just a lottery.I had zero expectations after reading the description.\u201cIf it's F to B, I'll basically get nothing from it.\u201dThere was nothing I could do about anything luck-related.'I could probably get a good price for this on Earth but\u2026'If a bunch of low-grade items inflated the market, that would become difficult too.Maybe I didn't get much because I used minimal effort in this trial.'Eh, I guess it makes sense that the tower didn't give me any bonus rewards.'I'd have to go higher to get anything of value.\u201cWhatever, I'll just use it and then absorb the souls.\u201dI pulled at the ribbon from the box.Slip.I still had some hope, but that just made me prone to disappointment.After pulling off the lid from the box\u2026Flash!Streams of bright white light poured out from the box and a message popped up.\u201cHuh\u2026?\u201d\u300c Congratulations! \u300d\u300c You received the highest possible grade item from the box! \u300dI just won a B-grade item.________Previous Chapter<All

These effects are so good.\u201dIt's probably one of the best B-ranked items at that.One thing I didn't understand was the 'Steel's Blessing' effect.Considering that the soul of a blacksmith was in it, it probably wasn't a normal effect.Especially because most item effects didn't get a name after them.At most, there were generally just small descriptions of the effect that it had.But\u2026If it did have a named effect, then it tended to be more special than just normal effects.Although I'd never really seen one in real life so I thought it was just an urban legend.'This item is bound to have some flaws, but goddamn.'It could have a better effect than most grade items.My expectations started getting higher and higher.I was pretty sure I hit the jackpot on this one.\u201cI wasn't even expecting anything\u2026 I can't believe it.\u201dI wanted to laugh as loud as I could, but I decided to compose myself.It's important to stay calm to matter what the circumstances are.'Whoo, let's calm down.'I put the pendant over my head and onto my neck.Shlaat.The chain trickled down as the jewel on the pendant came down to my heart.Despite it being a silver jewel, it was light and clear so I liked the aesthetics of it as well.Like an item handcrafted for me.And the effect of Steel's Blessing was\u2026\u300c Activating Wrought Iron Pendant's (B) effect 'Steel's Blessing.' \u300d\u300c Your skin adapts a property that absorbs all physical damage by 10% \u300dA higher-tier skill of my physical resistance.'Holy\u2026'It was technically more advanced than my physical resistance skill.If that skill allowed me to 'resist' a percentage of physical damage\u2026\u201cSteel's Blessing completely nullifies a percentage of physical damage.\u201dI personally didn't think much about the physical resistance skill.Because I didn't have a body like the doppelganger to take advantage of the skill.Even if I was able to resist attacks, it would be useless if my body couldn't brush the rest of the attacks off.Of course, it would shield me from some of the impacts but\u2026I didn't put that much emphasis on it.But this was different.Being able to absorb physical damage by 10% was way overpowered.'My skin can now absorb physical damage.'I wondered if there was a better resistance skill than this.The +7% to all the metal and blade skills might not be that great compared to A and S grade items but\u2014\u201cThis effect alone might make it better than that.\u201dEven if I eventually grew out of this effect, I could just sell it.This was bound to go for millions.Just the thought of it put a smile on my face.'I didn't even get a bonus reward, but where there's a will, there's a way.'Of course, this wasn't all fun and games.\u300c Mana has been exhausted. \u300d\u300c Deactivating Wrought Iron Pendant's (B) effect 'Steel's Blessing.' \u300d\u201c\u2026This thing sucks up mana like crazy.\u201dIn a blink of an eye, enough mana to use instant acceleration twice in a row had disappeared.Well, I guess it wouldn't matter once I got more mana, but a drawback was a drawback.'I'll have to turn it off and on only when I need it.'But if I couldn't get the activation timing correctly, it could backfire on me.\u201cI'll have to get some mana efficiency skills later.\u201dWhy were there so many skills I needed to get\u2026\u201cSigh, it would be so much better if I could learn skills a little more easily.\u201dApparently, I couldn't get extra skills no matter how many times I repeated the necessary acquiring actions.It hurt my head to think about all the things I'd need to get somehow.This was the reality of my talents, huh.'\u2026Nothing I can do about it now. I'll just have to wait till I get on the 8th floor.'They did say that I could buy skills after the expansion.And maybe I'd get the skills I needed from just climbing the tower.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cNow, let's check all those other things.\u201dFirst, let's check on the newly upgraded necromancy.\u300c Innate ability \u2013 'Necromancy (D) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Basic effect \u2013 Able to absorb the souls of the dead to increase or reinforce stats, mana, or something of a similar nature. \u300d\u300c Extra effect(1) \u2013 Able to permanently increase stats depending on the nature and rank of the soul. \u300d\u300c Extra effect(2) \u2013 Able to store souls for later use. Soul storage capacity depends on the ability's rank. \u300d\u300c Extra effect(3) \u2013 Able to acquire one skill bound to a soul at a certain percentage upon absorbing that soul. \u300d\u300c Extra effect(4) \u2013 Able to protect your body by consuming souls. The impact that can be absorbed is proportional to the souls used. \u300dThere was a new extra effect, but the description of the basic effect had also changed.'Increase or reinforce stats, mana, or something of a similar nature.'It didn't just say that the souls would strengthen me or that I would be able to turn them into something that I'd like.If I wanted more mana, I'd be able to get more mana.And if not, I'd be able to increase my stats.Plus\u2026'I got a defensive skill.'An ability to protect myself by consuming some of the souls I had stored.I was hoping that it would be something to help me steal more skills but\u2026'I guess not.'It wasn't bad, but I was a little bitter that my predictions were off.Mostly because I had to solely rely on my innate ability for growth due to a lack of my own talents.'I guess I can't just rely on the innate ability to help me.'I had to find other ways to get stronger.And the key to that wasn't with me, but with the tower.Whatever the 'pioneer' or the 'brilliance' was, if I could get all the benefits and get the skills I needed\u2026Then I wouldn't have to solely rely on my innate ability.\u201cI'll be there soon. Let's not rush.\u201dAs long as I survived the 7th trial, everything would be fine.So I just had to focus on the upcoming trial for now.'And it's not like I didn't need a way to protect myself.'It would be dangerous to face an intruder like I did on the 5th trial.The problem was how I could activate the ability but\u2014\u201cI don't really know how.\u201dTypically, I should naturally know how to use it but that wasn't the case this time.Then.'Maybe this counts as a passive ability.'I did hear about those kinds of innate abilities.One of the extra effects would be a passive that enhanced the already existing abilities.If my 4th effect was anything like that then\u2026The protection should be working already.'I guess I'll find out.'I turned the autohealing off and put my sword right up to my skin.Just in case the autohealing interfered with me testing this skill out.My tenacity was high enough to resist the blade but\u2026Crrrrrk!It wasn't so hard that I couldn't cut myself.The thunder blade was a C-grade item with a high enough cutting force, so it only made sense.I had to be careful because of all my extra buffs, but that wasn't going to stop me.'The extra cutting force, the triple lacerate skill, or the electrocution effect might be dangerous but\u2026'The electrocution effect was only on hit and shouldn't activate while the blade was already on my body\u2026And the cutting force was a passive skill, but I could control to what point I wanted to push down\u2026And I just didn't have to activate the laceration skill.So I put a little bit more pressure on my arm but\u2014\u300c A soul has absorbed an attack on the user. \u300d\u300c Soul of player 'Song Jinook' has been consumed. \u300d\u300c Number of souls in possession \u2013 3/30 \u300dThe blade that should have sliced through my flesh was blocked by a black fog of some kind.Where there should have been blood was not even a scar.\u201cOoh\u2026\u201dI wasted one of the souls I got from the 6th floor, but it didn't matter that much.I was more surprised by necromancy's ability to protect.\u201c\u2026It's better than I thought?\u201d'With this, I think I would be okay even if that black knight came at me again.'It depended on what the next trial would be, but it looked like it could become very useful.\u201cI probably shouldn't absorb all my souls then.\u201dThere should always be some souls just in case.Especially these low-level souls from low-level players.\u300c Skill \u2013 Contempt for the Weak (F) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 2% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 If all of the opponent's stats fail to exceed yours, your strength increases proportionally to the difference. \u300dThis was an achievement skill I got from the 6th trial.I knew how it worked, so I was able to skim over it.'Low-rank, but not bad.'It'd be helpful if I ever had to go against some small fries again.Even more so if I could get the grade up a little higher.'I guess that's it.'Now the only thing left to do was check how long I had to wait until I could start the next trial.Then check out what's going on in the community.That should have been it but\u2026\u201c\u2026What the hell is this?\u201dAn unexpected turn of events.\u300c Do you accept the 7th floor trial? \u300dIt seemed that there was no more waiting for a trial to start.The 4th effect is kinda disappointing but seems pretty opAlso the soul seems like such a waste cuz he could have gotten a skill from it???Cmon mcPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But the power behind it wasn't anything like what I remembered.Krraaaaaang-!The fist smashed the sand, causing a mini earthquake within a small radius.And the sandy winds blasted off like a storm in an empty field.I didn't take much damage because I had already taken a step back, but\u2026'Damn, how am I supposed to deal with a monster like this?'I couldn't help but scowl.In such a short amount of time, I couldn't have gotten strong enough to fight against this monster.Our weight classes were completely different.Making a single mistake could lead to my death, and not making one would just barely increase my chances of staying alive.That intruder was a piece of cake compared to what was going on here.'I don't fare well against these types.'Humongous monsters like these are supposed to be dealt with using skills.But I didn't have anything of that sort.I needed something that could get through its tough outer layer, but my fighting style relied on mobility.Crash! Kraang! Crack!

Kraang! Kooorang! Kang!The golem noticed that something had changed and kept up its barrage\u2026'Yeah, keep attacking. Show me an opening.'But I didn't stand down.Instead, I took this time to zigzag through the attacks to get closer to the main body.Fwoooosh-!The giant fist rushed past my face, a gust of wind grazing against my cheek.But for some reason, I wasn't scared.It was a million times harder than the tutorial trial, but I was never calmer.Right as I faced the sand pillar that was its leg, I swung my sword.Sliiiiit!The sword slid right through its leg and sliced it off cleanly.As I did the same to its other leg, the golem stumbled and fell to the ground.Kroooooong.Of course, that wasn't the end.\u201cGr-graaaa\u2026!\u201dAlthough the entity didn't seem to feel pain, it realized that I had the upper hand now.The flustered giant tried to push itself up with its arms, but I wasn't going to let that happen.Slaaaash-!\u300c All three attacks complete. \u300d\u300c Deactivating the skill 'Triple Laceration.' \u300dI shifted my eyes as soon as I cut off its left arm.The skill was deactivated, but the sand golem couldn't do anything to resist now.'This should be enough to destroy the core.'This monster wouldn't die just because its body was in pieces.No matter the environment, it would survive as long as its core stayed intact.I scanned him quickly to find where the core might be.'His core should be\u2026'A red stone on its back caught my eye.I climbed onto its back and shoved my sword down into the red jewel.Crack!\u300c You have proved that you've overcome your fear. \u300d\u300c Ending the first trial. \u300dIn an instant, my surroundings reverted back to the dark hallway.\u201cHuff, huff.\u201dToo bad I didn't get the chance to absorb the sand golem's soul.But this was neither the time nor place for that.'I don't have enough time left.'I have to finish the other two trials before time runs out.I caught my breath and ran through the endless hallway to get to the second area of the 7th trial.Dash!Reaching the next area didn't take very long.\u300c Entering the second trial area. \u300d\u300c Prove that you have overcome your wisdom. \u300dThe scenery started to change rapidly again.I was wondering if it would replicate a previous trial again, and\u2026\u201c\u2026I was right, damn it.\u201dIn an instant, I was standing in the forest from the 2nd-floor trial.The only difference was that the first trial was replicated from the beginning of the 1st-floor trial.But this time\u2026Crackle, crackle!The nearby trees were immediately engulfed by flames.This was the scene from when I completed the 2nd-floor trial.'Prove that I've overcome my wisdom?'A trial that I wouldn't have been able to clear if the orc hunters hadn't left their base.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

You have overcome the Tower of Trials floor 7. \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received the skill 'Wind's Grace ().' \u300d\u300c As a reward, you have received '15,000 points.' \u300d\u300c As a bonus reward, you have received the item 'Boots of Swiftness (C+).' \u300d\u300c Please move to the waiting area. \u300dA portal appeared in front of my eyes after the succession of messages.Voom\u2026!\u201cI'm finally done with this damn trial\u2026\u201dUnexpectedly, I almost died from the trial, and there were no surprises like an intruder.But I was still alive, and it was time to end this trial.\u300c Moving to the waiting room. \u300dA message that I have never seen before appeared in front of my eyes.\u300c More than 1000 people have cleared the 7th trial. \u300d\u300c The system expansion is starting. \u300d\u300c You are one of the challengers designated as a 'pioneer.' \u300d\u300c You are now able to choose a radiance. \u300dThe expansion has finally begun.Bin: What are the chances he just goes home and the story ends with him as a successful hunter?Phylicia: 0 because it's only chapter 39.

carefully\u2026\u201dThe tower hasn't given advice like this before.This meant that choosing a radiance was important, even to the tower.\u300c Please choose one of these available options. \u300d\u300c Conqueror \u300d\u300c Hunter \u300d\u300c Monk \u300d\u201cAre these radiances\u2026?\u201d\u201cHm, I guess I'll look at the details first.\u201dEven if I wanted to make a choice, I didn't know anything about these.\u300c Conqueror \u300d\u300c A radiance that changes depending on the individual's abilities. \u300d\u300c Helps the individual become an all-rounder rather than a specialist and is closely related to their innate ability. \u300d\u300c Potential for battle, growth, support, and creation increases greatly. \u300d\u300c Innate power is 'Skill Combination.' \u300d\u300c This is the most fitting radiance for challenger Han Sungyeun. \u300d\u201cHm\u2026\u201dI wasn't able to tell exactly what it could do just by reading the description, but I could tell it was a good one.My potential for everything would increase, and it would affect my ability\u2026'This means that it'll be helpful to my future growth.'It sounded like a perfect fit.The innate power also seemed interesting.Even the tower determined that this would be the best radiance for me.But I couldn't make a decision just yet.\u300c Hunter \u300d\u300c A radiance that anyone could easily get used to. \u300d\u300c Specializes in growth and does not have a significant effect on an innate ability. \u300d\u300c However, this radiance is closely related to stat and skill growth. \u300d\u300c It increases the growth rate of skill proficiencies. \u300d\u300c Innate power is 'Level Up.' \u300d\u300c This is an adequate radiance for challenger Han Sungyeun. \u300d\u201cThis one isn't bad either.\u201dThe tower seemed to agree with me.Even if it wouldn't affect my innate ability, the stat increase would be very compatible.And I had a good idea of what the 'Level Up' power would do.'If this were a game, it would be like choosing your occupation.''Hunter' would be an occupation that allowed you to level yourself up.I assumed that leveling up would directly increase stats and skill proficiency.This radiance's effect wasn't bad, but it would overlap with my innate ability.'And the last one is\u2026'\u300c Monk \u300d\u300c A radiance that is greatly affected by talent and hard work. \u300d\u300c Specializes in growth, but everything is strictly determined by talent and hard work. \u300d\u300c Becomes stronger the more time you invest and requires a lot of talent. \u300d\u300c Could be completely fruitless without the required talents. \u300d\u300c Innate power is 'Path of Training.' \u300d\u300c Currently not recommended for challenger Han Sungyeun. \u300d\u201cMeh.\u201dDefinitely not the one for me.The 'hard work' part wasn't an issue, but it required talent\u2026Also, I didn't have any information about this innate power\u2026'I'll pass on this and just choose between the other two.'As the tower suggested, I should think very carefully before making a choice.The radiances seemed to affect innate abilities or skills\u2026'They also have things called 'innate powers,' and those seem pretty good.'\u201cI think I'll have to choose Conqueror.\u201dI could replace Hunter's abilities with necromancy, but Conqueror was a well-rounded radiance that would be beneficial in many ways.And the tower said that it would be the best fit considering my innate ability.Plus, I've been looking for something like 'Skill Combination' to spice up my abilities.'No matter what, increased potential and the ability to combine skills should make this worth it.'Tap.\u300c You have selected Conqueror. \u300d\u300c Innate ability is evolving according to the selected radiance. \u300d\u300c Displaying choices with regard to the challenger's ability. \u300dMessages kept popping up even after I made my choice.\u300c Summoner \u2013 Use the absorbed souls to raise powerful undead skeletons. \u300d\u300c Magic Swordsman \u2013 Increases talent in magic and swordsmanship, and related skills can be learned three times more quickly. \u300d\u300c Creator \u2013 Increases talent related to item creation, and related skills can be learned three times more quickly. \u300d\u201cThey did say it would be closely related to my innate ability\u2026\u201dAs they promised, the radiance was evolving my innate ability.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAfter reading all three descriptions, I came to a conclusion.\u201cThey all seem kind of useless\u2026?\u201dMagic Swordsman wouldn't really help me since I didn't have much talent to begin with\u2026Same thing with Creator.'It would have been a different story if it raised my talents by a set value rather than multiplying them.'After all, zero times anything is zero.So I chose the least of the three evils: Summoner.\u300c The Summoner trait is being added to the innate ability 'Necromancy.' \u300d\u300c Existing effects have been slightly altered, and new effects are being added. \u300d\u300c The innate power 'Skill Combination' is being created. \u300dAfter the messages stopped, I opened my status window.\u300c Han Sungyeun \u300d\u300c Radiance \u2013 Conqueror ]\u300c Strength \u2013 55 \u300d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u300c Stamina \u2013 51 \u300d\u300c Agility \u2013 56 \u300d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u300c Mana \u2013 43 \u300d\u300c Tenacity \u2013 43 \u300d\u300c Innate ability \u2013 Necromancy (D) \u300d\u300c Innate power \u2013 Skill Combination \u300d\u300c Skill \u2013 See details \u300dSome of my stats went up slightly.But more importantly, the radiance and innate power were added.\u201cOoh\u2026\u201dSeeing them listed so clearly on my window was pretty satisfying.I looked into it a little more.\u300c Innate power \u2013 Skill Combination \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 Can select two skills to combine. When the two selected skills are different in rank, the higher-ranking skill becomes the core skill. \u300dIt had the exact effect that I expected.'I can just get rid of my useless skills.'Or maybe I could combine similar skills to upgrade them.It did say that the higher-ranking skill would be the core, so the innate power had unlimited potential.And my innate ability\u2026\u300c Consumes stored souls to raise a nearby dead. The strength of the raised dead will be proportional to the quality and quantity of the consumed souls. \u300dThe newly-added effect seemed interesting.Now necromancy is finally living up to its name.\u201cAll necromancers should have a summoning ability.\u201dI assumed something like this was bound to appear sometime soon.Considering the utility of the skill, this should be pretty good.So far, I had zero regrets about choosing this radiance.Too bad I couldn't test it out here.\u201cThe effects are too vague.\u201dLike how long the raised dead would last or what actually counted as a nearby dead.There was a high chance that the skill would have unintended effects if I used it here.If I suddenly summoned a deteriorating corpse in the waiting area, it's not like I could throw it out.And I wasn't planning to see if I could fit a corpse in the inventory.'I'll try it out back in the real world or in another trial.'It was about time that I went back again.But\u2026\u201cSkill Combination is different.\u201dI had no qualms about trying that out right now.Similar to what happened for my innate ability, a panel appeared in front of me as soon as I had the urge to use the skill.\u300c Activating the innate power 'Skill Combination.' \u300d\u300c Listing the available skills. \u300d\u300c Please select two skills from the list. \u300d\u2026Seeing all the various skills gave me a feeling of pride.It wasn't too long ago that I didn't have a single one.'I guess I've grown a lot.'But I couldn't be too full of myself because quantity doesn't mean quality.\u201cHm, what shall I combine\u2026\u201dIt was harder than I expected.Pain Resistance activated more often than I would've liked it to, and Accelerated Regeneration was an irreplaceable skill.I couldn't combine skills randomly because I didn't know what the result would be.'What do I not care about too much\u2026?'I went through the list slowly and decided on two skills.'I didn't use either of them during battle\u2026'I couldn't use the former unless my opponent was weaker than me.And I couldn't use the latter unless I was in serious danger.It was never used because my fighting style revolved around my agility.I wouldn't miss them too much if they were gone.'Acquiring a high-tier skill would be nice\u2026'But I didn't expect much.Expectations only brought about disappointment.'I thought I would become a hunter after I awakened as a player.'But that was when I hit rock bottom.I knew better than to expect anything from life.\u300c The two skills are identical in rank. \u300d\u300c Please select the core skill. \u300dIt seemed that I could choose one of the skills to be the core if they were the same rank.'Contempt for the Weak is probably a better choice than Sustain Battle.'\u300c Skill Combination will start with 'Contempt for the Weak' as the core. \u300d\u300c Current probability for a high-tier skill is 80%. \u300d\u300c Start the combination? \u300dThere was only one answer for that question.\u300c Combination complete. \u300dAnd as that message phased out, the new message emitted a golden glow.\u300c Forming a new skill! \u300dDam i forgot how sadboi the mc wasWhen will he get his confidencePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Also strengthens eyesight. \u300dThe proficiency didn't carry over, but the result was similar to that of the previous combination.'The activation requirement and nature of the skill seems to be determined by the core.'And Heat Resistance added some resilience effects to the skill.'I think I figured out what determines the tier upgrade rate.'It was probably the compatibility of the two skills.Contempt for the Weak and Sustain Battle were somewhat related to each other\u2026But I could tell that Heat Resistance and Ranger's Knowledge were not very compatible.Looking back, I'm actually surprised that the rank didn't decrease.'I guess I should stop messing around with skills for now.'There was one combination that might have worked well, but I didn't want to deal with the risks.Worst-case scenario, I'd get a skill that was worse than either of the two I combined.'Let's look at the other rewards.'\u300c Skill \u2013 Wind's Blessing () \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 Increases all speeds by 10% upon declaration of the skill's name. This effect can be stacked up to seven times. When the maximum amount of stacks is reached, the skill receives a one-day cooldown.\u00a0 \u300d\u201cSo it basically increases all speeds by 70%.\u201dAn effect that I could only dream of\u2026'I wanted something to mitigate the harsh mana costs of instant acceleration.'Since Instant Acceleration was a D-rank skill, it took a decent amount of mana to activate.Although it seemed like it would rank up soon, I wanted to stop being so dependent on mana.These trial rewards were always satisfactory.In addition\u2026\u300c Boots of Swiftness \u300d\u300c Grade: C+ \u300d\u300c Movement Speed: +5% \u300d\u300c Boots decorated with tiny wings, created by magical mechanics. \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

ThanksBut getting into one was harder than it seemed.For your first dungeon, you needed to be accompanied by at least one other person.This rule was set to prevent new hunters from getting into accidents.'The problem is that finding a party is a pretty difficult task\u2026'And there were a bunch of other problems such as distributing the rewards or partying with a malicious hunter.That's why you needed a strong network to get into a dungeon, whether it was a guild, family, or friends.But it was safe to say that I had none of that.\u201cDamn it.\u201dI never thought I'd live to see the day when I would need a network of my own.Even if I solved this problem, I would also need to find a dungeon I could actually get into.There were a bunch of dungeons that were managed by guilds or associations, but that posed a whole new set of problems.Exclusive dungeons were relatively easy to get into.If I were part of a guild, all I'd have to do was sign up for my guild's exclusive dungeon.But public dungeons were different.Most public dungeons had long wait times and were very inefficient to grind in.This was because most of the good dungeons were automatically claimed.\u201cJust problem after problem.\u201dI sighed and walked out onto my balcony.The scenery wasn't anything magnificent, but the fresh air still cleared my head.\u201cWhat should I do\u2026?\u201dIt was too late to join a guild and meet people\u2026'Actually, there is one person in my network.'It wasn't the closest relationship, but it wasn't nothing.The only person I talked to in the tower.-Please contact Lee Hayeon of the White Silver guild once you get back to Earth.She even added me as a friend.Of course, I never actually messaged her afterwards.She did try to contact me a couple of times, but I never had the time to respond.In one of those messages, she left her number and asked me to give her a call once I got the time.Seeing that her skills weren't too bad, she was probably back by now.'I did help her with the 4th trial.

D or higher only. \u300dSince all the rewards and responsibilities were split evenly, duo parties were typically formed by very skilled hunters.There was a little more risk involved, but it couldn't be that much worse than the 4th trial.I literally put those two in a stroller and rolled them out of the trial.\u201cIf I can't even solo a D-grade dungeon, that's an entirely different problem on its own.\u201dSoon enough, my party request was accepted.He probably saw that I was a C-rank hunter and accepted it immediately.He was even willing to give up any of the special rewards.I guess he really wanted to duo with me.'Pros of being a high-ranking hunter.'With a smirk on my face, I grabbed a taxi off the side of the road.\u201cJikdonggeonlin Park, please.\u201dI was wondering what I would do if there was an item I really needed.'I guess I don't even need to worry.'I could already tell that this was going to be very worthwhile.Sitting on a bench in Jikdonggeonlin Park, Lee Cheolwon hastily typed his post.\u201cHoly shit, why are there so many people here?\u201dIt hadn't even been an hour since the emergency alerts were sent, but there were already crowds of over ten people by the gates.Lee Cheolwon let out a sigh after seeing the high spec gear everyone had on.'How many hunters were near the area\u2026?'He thought there would be two, or maybe three teams.'It must be because of the damn trial tower or whatever.'Recently, hunters who were at a place called the Tower of Trials sold a bunch of low-grade items and made it really hard for amateur hunters to make a living.The items weren't worth what they used to be\u2026All the low-rank hunters nearby probably came here to make a quick buck.\u201cLife's hard, huh.\u201dDespite that, Lee Cheolwon had no intentions of backing down.For a D-rank hunter like him, entering this gate would be like winning a lottery.It was typically much harder to earn big bucks while freelancing in the public dungeons.Plus, the items from those dungeons weren't worth much anymore.The world was changing again.Even a low-tier hunter like Cheolwon could tell.There were all kinds of rumors about the tower, like how it roped in civilians forcefully.Or how the hunters would lose all their powers once they entered the tower.It was like the great calamity all over again.'At least my partner is supposed to be a C-rank hunter.''It doesn't look like he has much experience, but he's still a higher rank than me.'A high-ranking hunter with no experience was way better than a low-ranking hunter with experience.No matter how much experience you had, raw power is what mattered the most.It was then.\u201cAre you Lee Cheolwon? The one looking for a duo?\u201dThe anticipated C-rank hunter had finally arrived.I walked over to the man sitting on the bench after arriving at the park.'Is this the person who was looking for a duo?'He must be, since this was the location that he specified in his texts.\u201cYeah, I'm Lee Cheolwon. Does that mean you're\u2026\u201d\u201cYes, I'm Han Sungyeun.\u201d\u201cAh, nice to meet you. You seem like a promising new hunter.\u201d\u201cHaha, it's not like that. You seem to have a lot more experience than me. I'll be in your care.\u201dI scoped this Lee Cheolwon person out while we made small talk.A spear engraved with a lion's face and leather armor with an aura of cool air.His equipment was so well-maintained that I could tell the items were high-quality at a glance.'Better than I thought.'I guess he wasn't looking for a duo just to get carried.Most of his items seemed to be above E-grade, which made him seem more trustworthy.Even though I didn't know the exact effects of his items, he should be an adequate partner to clear this dungeon with.As I was admiring my luck, Lee Cheolwon started to speak.\u201cI know you were already informed, but there are a total of three gates in this park. We will be entering the second one, and I already got the license to go in. And I doubt any other teams want to get into this one.\u201d\u201cHmmm, sounds nice. Can I ask why none of the other teams want this dungeon?\u201d\u201cIt's a bit more dangerous than the other two dungeons, and the internal structure is very narrow. A party with more than three people would have a difficult time getting anything done.\u201dThe hunters around us were all in full parties.This meant that we would have the dungeon all to ourselves.'And that means more rewards for me.'Lee Cheolwon continued to speak as I stood there and listened.\u201cYeah, and since I'm a D-rank and you're a C, this is very doable.\u201dAs if he had to convince me to not turn back.\u201cI see. I agree with you.\u201dI didn't have any intentions of going back empty-handed.'And this is a prime opportunity to train for the 8th trial.'That was half the reason I came here.\u201cWe don't have too much time left, so let's get going. We'll be distributing all the rewards 50/50 like standard duo parties. And if you want to, we can discuss claiming specific drops from the dungeon later.\u201dI nodded.\u201cSure.\u201dThere wasn't much to disagree on.\u201cI'll be in your care now, Hunter Han Sungyeun-nim.\u201dHe smiled and stuck out his hand.\u201cLikewise.\u201dI shook his hand and gave him a faint smile.It was time to start my first dungeon incursion as a hunter.Voom\u2026!The scenery changed as soon as we stepped into the portal at the center of the park.Of course, something like this didn't surprise me anymore.It was common in the tower.Also, I already knew that these gates generated domains that were completely disconnected from reality.I heard that the most common environments were plains, deserts, or cave-like areas.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksAnd this time, it happened to be a cave.\u201cWhat a shame. Melee fighting styles aren't very suited for caves.\u201dLee Cheolwon looked around the cave with a frown.He wouldn't be able to fully swing his spear in an environment that was this narrow\u2026There were other factors as well.\u201cThis cave is definitely too narrow for two people to fight side by side.\u201dI agreed with the scowling man and started to observe the area.There was just enough room for us to walk side by side.Even though my weapon was a sword, there still wasn't enough space for both of us to swing our weapons simultaneously.But this was just the entrance, and we didn't know what was ahead of us.Dungeons could be quite unpredictable.I was sure the area would widen as we approached the center of the dungeon.But that didn't mean that we could let our guard down.'Monsters can come out no matter where you are in the dungeon.'They tended to not be near the entrance, but nothing was guaranteed in dungeons.I slowly raised my sword and suggested that we keep walking.\u201cLet's keep up our guard and start moving forward.\u201dHe finally snapped out of his thoughts and nodded.\u201cYou're right. Just follow me while being wary of our surroundings.\u201dHe got in front of me and started taking the lead.'Wait, I wanted to be in the front.'It would have been the ideal way to test out all the new skills I had.I wanted to protest against his decision, but Lee Cheolwon was an experienced hunter.'I guess it's only right that he takes the lead.'And I heard that the real hunting started at the center of the dungeon.There was no need to rush into things.Trying out my new skills was important, but observing an experienced hunter would also be beneficial.I reassured myself and followed Lee Cheolwon deeper into the cave.It was then.\u201cKieeeeek\u2026\u201dLee Cheolwon's eyes widened as the low-pitched growl got louder.\u201cHmm, lizardmen\u2026 That's not a good sign.\u201dLizardmen were D-ranked humanoid reptilian monsters.The only special thing about them was that they used weapons skills, unlike goblins or orcs.They were actually known to have high-tier weapon skills.\u201cKieeek, kieeeek.\u201dA lizardman holding a long spear flared its eyes as it made its way toward us.\u201cA long spear and weapon skills? That's gonna be annoying.\u201d\u201cIt'll be better if one of us takes it down.\u201d\u201cYeah. I'll take him since I have a longer range with my spear.\u201d\u201c\u2026Okay.\u201dI thought about it for a bit, but this was just one monster.'I'll let him have this one.'Plus, this was an opportunity to see how an experienced hunter fought.I was about to take a step back until I saw that Lee Cheolwon was just staring the lizardman down.'What the\u2026?'I thought he would end the fight instantly, but they both circled each other.Feigning attacks while looking for opportunities to strike?This was not what I signed up to see.I wasn't going to waste my three days on Earth like this.Why was he struggling so much against a single lizardman at the entrance?'Stalling like this could be problematic\u2026'Emergency gates were different from normal dungeons in a couple of ways.The only reason they let random hunters into these gates was to stop the monsters from getting out.After some time, the hunter association would either blockade the gate or designate it as a public dungeon.Then the hunters from the association could come and clear the dungeon.I was under not one, but two different time limits.'We can't waste any more time.'Change of plans.I was done observing this guy.\u201cLet me lend you a hand.\u201dMy actions were faster than my words.I propelled myself forward instantly.Crash!Lee Cheolwon stared in dismay as I bolted past him.\u201cWhat the fuck?!

I hope you don't mind.\u201d\u201cAh yeah\u2026 I understand. Very understandable.\u201dHe nodded as he stared into the empty space in front of me.It was as if he didn't understand what had just happened\u2026This was the perfect time to convince him.\u201cBy the way, I have a suggestion.

We can decide who gets to keep it later.\u201d\u201cAh, yeah\u2026 Is this your second time in a dungeon?\u201d\u201cHmm, not really\u2026\u201d\u201cI guess you just seem very experienced\u2026\u201dI fought my ass off in the tower and spent countless years studying theories, but that wasn't any of his business.\u201cI just saw it on Youtube.\u201d\u201cReally.\u201d\u201cAh, okay\u2026\u201dHe looked at me inconspicuously but didn't question it any further.My records did say that I had no experience, and that wasn't very important right now.'He can think whatever he wants as long as he doesn't keep bothering me with questions.'\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the lizardman. \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 0.7% \u300d'It's getting harder to increase proficiency with D-rank monsters.'My face scrunched up as I walked away from the corpse.The only reason I came here was to prepare for the 8th trial, but I was barely making any progress.I guess I could use my innate ability to raise my stats to a certain point, but it wouldn't even come close to ranking up.Honestly, ranking up my innate ability was difficult even in the tower.It made sense that fighting weaker monsters in this dungeon wasn't much help.However, quantity was more important than quality.If I could farm every monster in this dungeon, there would be a noticeable difference sooner or later.\u201cLet's keep moving.\u201dI stared into the dark like a starving kid looking at a buffet.It was time to start the hunt.Pat!\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the lizardman. \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 0.7% \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

I didn't realize that the whole cave would be this narrow. I won't object if you decide to take a larger percentage of the rewards.\u201dHe laughed because he probably realized how ridiculous his suggestion sounded.\u201cIt's alright. We can split it 50/50.\u201d\u201cI just feel bad that I-\u201d\u201cOn the condition that I can keep all the boss room rewards.\u201dLee Cheolwon was the one who got the license to enter this dungeon.Even if he didn't participate in the battles, he still had a right to the rewards.The dungeon was also beneficial to my growth, so I felt kind of bad about taking most of the rewards for myself.Well, I might have taken all of them if he didn't get the license.\u201cIf that's all you want, I would be happy to concede all of the boss room rewards.\u201dLee Cheolwon replied carefully after considering my proposition.\u201cThat's all I need. Are you fine with going into the boss room now?\u201d\u201cI mean, of course\u2026 I didn't do anything. Don't you need to take a break?\u201d\u201cI don't really feel the need to.\u201d\u201cI-I see\u2026\u201dHe stared at me like I was an exotic animal in the zoo, but what was I supposed to say?Since the monsters came one at a time, I couldn't have gotten tired.'It would've been tougher if they came at me all at once like the orcs.'Without coordinated attacks, I wasn't even close to being out of breath.Anyway, I couldn't waste time resting.I had to take full advantage of this dungeon and leave as soon as possible.\u201cAlright.

That must be the lizard king.\u201dSeemed fitting.'A lizard king.'A more evolved version of a lizardman.They usually had a lot of utility skills, and their weapon skills were several times more deadly than normal lizardman's.They could temporarily disable a target's movements and even poison them.They might seem like a pain in the ass to deal with, but they actually aren't that bad.I knew even though I had never fought one.The hunter association said that an experienced B-rank hunter could solo this thing.Lizard kings had a variety of skills but didn't specialize in anything.'I read that it shouldn't be too hard as long as you can use some of your skills.'The skills that I got from the tower should be more than enough.\u201cW-what are you going to do\u2026?\u201dThe innocent D-rank hunter questioned me nervously.He must have thought that the two of us wouldn't be able to take it on, but that wasn't a problem.\u201cJust wait here for a bit.\u201d\u201cHuh? I-I mean, do you have a plan? I can support you\u2026!\u201d\u201cI'm good. Just stay back. You can help me if I look like I'm in trouble.\u201dI could finally see exactly how much stronger I had gotten in the tower.Beating this boss with Lee Cheolwon's assistance would be pointless.'Eh, it doesn't look like it'll take that long.'Koong.The ground shook as the displeased lizard king stood up from his throne.It was then.\u201cH-he's going to attack!

You basically soloed this dungeon anyway\u2026\u201dHe probably thought he was lucky to have gotten even a fraction of the rewards.\u201cWell, let's loot the lizard king and get out of here.\u201dI headed to the lizard king's corpse before Lee Cheolwon could change his mind.Looting it was only second to what I really wanted to do.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the lizard king. \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 11% \u300d'As expected.'The lizard king far surpassed the lizardmen's 0.7%.As I approached the corpse to extract the core, I activated necromancy.\u300c Permanently increasing your stats using the lizard king's soul. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 2. \u300d\u300c Agility increased by 1. \u300d\u300c Stamina increased by 4. \u300d\u300c Mana increased by 4. \u300d\u300c Tenacity increased by 5. \u300dI left most of the souls alone just in case I needed them for protection or something, but the lizard king's soul was worth consuming for the stats.Increasing my stats for the 8th trial was one of the reasons I came to Earth anyway.'Hm, not bad.'But the messages weren't over.\u300c Acquiring one of the lizard king's skills. \u300dI had completely forgotten that this could happen.Bin- Go little rock star~Phylici :rseveryonelookingatnankit: I only kept that part so Bin could make this joke :/Bin- Why the skelly so weak it seems like a wastePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There's no way they finished already. Why did they come out?'His questions didn't stay unanswered for long.\u201cUhhh?\u201dThe azure gate turned into an ashy color as soon as the two hunters stepped out.As far as he knew, there was only one condition under which this happened.\u201cWhen the boss room is cleared\u2026\u201dAlso, the boss would respawn after a certain time period.This meant that those two just cleared a perpetual gate by themselves.\u201cWhat the fuck?!\u201dHe couldn't help but burst into laughter when he realized this.For the first time in his three years of being part of the supervision team, someone had cleared a dungeon.I came out of the gate with a huge smile on my face.\u300c Skill \u2013 Mind's Eye (D-) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 During battle, you can perceive attacks from outside your range of vision. \u300dI had obtained one of the lizard king's skills.Because of the low probability, I hadn't even considered that this would happen.My luck seemed to have turned around after I entered the tower of trials.'I seriously can't believe that I got a skill.'I would probably get more skills once I absorbed all of the lizardmen.My combination skill would soon come in handy again.'I knew going into the dungeon was the right choice.'After looking at the unexpected rewards from the excavation, I couldn't help but be satisfied.As I walked out with a triumphant look on my face, a man in a black suit interrupted me.\u201cPlease wait\u2026!\u201dHe sprinted toward me and paused to catch his breath.\u201cDid you clear this gate?\u201dLee Cheolwon turned around to answer that question with another question.\u201cI'm sorry, but who are you to ask us that?\u201dTaken aback, the man placed his hands on his heart and exhaled.\u201cAh, I'm sorry about that.

Haha, I didn't get a chance to greet you earlier because another member of my team was stationed at the gate.\u201dIt looked like he rushed here after noticing that we cleared the gate.'Fine by me. I was looking for a way to sell the ownership license.'This would save me the trouble of looking for a potential buyer myself.I would've sold it to a guild if I were associated with one, but the hunter association was probably the best option right now.Lee Cheolwon was the first to respond.\u201cBy any chance, did you want to purchase the rights to this gate?\u201d\u201cYes. I wanted to offer you two a deal\u2026\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

To get to the point, my team would like to purchase the rights to this gate at 1.2 million dollars.\u201d'Ooh\u2026'It was more than I expected.They were willing to pay 1.2 million for just a D-rank gate.'Is this gate even worth that much?\u201dWith that kind of money, you could easily buy a C-rank dungeon.Of course I would be surprised.\u201cIt seems like a fair price.

Would you like to sign it nearby?\u201d\u201cThat works for me.\u201dI couldn't stay here for long.Sim Woojin told me that he would meet me at a cafe nearby.\u201cWow, that was amazing. I've never seen someone get an offer on the spot like that.\u201dLee Cheolwon stared at me in awe.\u201cReally? Doesn't this happen after completing a dungeon?\u201d\u201cThat only happens to high-rank hunters, not people like us.\u201d\u201cWell, let's start splitting the loot. No matter what happened, you were still the one who got us into the dungeon.\u201d\u201cOkay, do you mind if I sell the cores? I know a guy who would buy it for above market price.\u201d\u201cHmm, I don't mind. Let's do that.\u201dWhy am I trusting a complete stranger with this?Because it would save me the trouble of finding a place to sell them.Plus, I made a lot more money by selling the rights to the gate.\u201cIf you leave me your contact information, I'll give you a call.\u201dAfter we exchanged our information, Lee Cheolwon left the premises.\u201cNow, let's go finalize that contract.\u201dI didn't have much time left.'I have to make the most of it.'The chance that another emergency gate would pop up was close to zero.If I wanted to go into a higher-tier dungeon, I would need some sort of connection.I already had a plan for that.The contract was finalized without a hitch.\u201cAs per the contract, I will send you the money by tomorrow.\u201dSim Woojin gave me a wide smile as soon as I signed.I appreciated how quick and smooth the process was, and I got up from my seat.\u201cHan Sungyeun-nim, if you aren't tied to any organization, would you be interested in joining the hunter association?\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you asking if I want to be a hunter for the association?\u201d\u201cYes. I checked your records, and you seem to be a recently registered hunter. We assure you that the association will provide you with the best possible conditions.\u201dI considered it for a moment.I would need to join some sort of organization if I wanted to act at my discretion.And I had no qualms about that organization being the hunter association.Plus, this was the second time they had given me a scouting offer.But I was a bit reluctant to get tied to an organization.I would prefer something like a freelance position while still having access to everything I needed\u2026It all came down to how strict the association was with their hunters.And in my head, they weren't very strict.It was a viable choice, but I wanted to give it more thought.I could always come back to this later, and I already had something planned.\u201cI can't give you a response right now.\u201d\u201cI understand.

They will bring about the next revolution.\u201dThe team was created to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of this world.Lee Hayeon didn't consider the tower to be a disaster, but another opportunity.The tower had a lot of risks associated with it, but the rewards were just as valuable.And\u2014'The tower isn't a place for just hunters.'Any normal civilian could be summoned there for no reason at all.Since only the hunters' abilities are reset upon the start of the trials, a normal person could see this as an opportunity to awaken\u2026'If those people survived, they must have gotten a lot more powerful.'There was no question that scouting them would benefit the guild greatly.Same with hunters.'Since challengers receive rewards as they climb\u2026'Hunters could grow to be even stronger than they previously were.No matter what happened, maintaining a friendly relationship with the challengers would prove to be a profitable investment.So Lee Hayeon founded the 'Challenger Supervision' team and became its first leader.She was currently doing all that she could to identify and reach out to those who came out of the tower.Of course, it wasn't as easy as it sounded.\u201cI know that they don't want to be discovered but I didn't realize how hard this would be\u2026\u201dThe challengers never outright revealed that they were from the tower.'It would be a lot easier if I could just do this when I'm back at the tower, but I still have some time left before I return\u2026'The problems kept accumulating the more she looked into it.And\u2026Besides a handful of people, the number of thoughtful and cautious challengers she'd recruited was barely in the double digits.Even worse, most of them were from the easy difficulty.That wasn't enough to effectively take advantage of this new world that was the Tower of Trials.\u201c\u2026If only we had a single person from the hard difficulty.\u201dAn ambitious enough challenger would be itching to keep climbing the tower if they had half a brain.Just like that man Lee Hayeon saw on the 4th floor.\u201cI wonder what he's up to now.\u201dIt wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that he single-handedly cleared the 4th trial.Not even the more experienced hunters could do anything against his strength.Too bad he hadn't responded to any of my messages after adding me as a friend.Maybe it was because he wasn't very talkative post-murder but\u2026'I also didn't say much.'I wouldn't be surprised if he'd already returned to Earth and gone back for the next trial.'He's too much of a gem to miss though\u2026'His insane growth was just a part of it, but more than that, he was a trainee without any ties to big organizations.\u201cShould I have tried to recruit him when I had the chance\u2026?\u201dAnd while she was swimming in regret\u2014Bzzzt!The facedown smartphone got Lee Hayeon's attention.'What is it? I don't think there's anyone who'd contact me at this time.'She reached out to see if it was another spam text and then\u2014\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dWhen she saw who the message was from\u2026\u300c Hello, this is Han Sungyeun. We met on the 4th floor. Do you have time to meet with me if you've returned? \u300dShe almost forgot how to breathe.I put my phone back in my pocket after sending the text.There was no guarantee that she was back here on Earth or that she'd see the message but\u2026Well, it wasn't something to think that hard about.I already got my most pressing concern out of the way, and I could always think more about joining different organizations.All I wanted to ask was if she knew of any place that may accept the terms that I came up with.'I guess it doesn't matter if she ends up not responding.'But\u2026As soon as I stepped out of the cafe.Bzzzt!My phone rendered my concerns meaningless as it rang not a minute after my message had been sent.\u201cWh\u201d\u300c Of course! I can meet with you any time! \u300dIt might have been just me, but I got a cheerful vibe from the message.But that wasn't a bad thing.\u300c So you've returned as well. Do you have time to meet sometime soon? I got the cheapest return stone, so I don't have much time. \u300dAs soon as I was about to send that message\u2014Ding!\u300c If you let me know where you are I'll go as soon as I can! \u300dI smiled at the fact that she responded to a message I hadn't even sent.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'I guess she's in a rush too.'I was wondering if she bought the same type of return stone as me but\u2026That wasn't that important, so I erased the current message to send her a new response.Not even a second later\u2014\u300c Alright. I'm heading there now. Please give me a second. \u300dI told her my location and her messages stopped after saying she was on her way.\u201cMaybe she's closer than I thought.\u201dWell, she didn't tell me exactly when she was getting here but\u2026Judging by her text, I feel like it wouldn't take that long.I sat back down and leisurely sipped on a drink for maybe 10 minutes before\u2014Di-ring\u2026The doors to the cafe opened and a harsh gasping filled the room.When I turned around to see who had entered, a beautiful lady in a black suit greeted me.\u201cMister\u2026 Huff\u2026 Han\u2026?\u201dIt was Lee Hayeon.\u201c\u2026When did you get back? I assumed that you returned early because you didn't respond to my message.\u201dIt was as though she didn't believe that I'd still be here.I could understand why she thought that though.I made an erratic move of returning for three days on the 5th floor; there's no way she could have predicted where I was.'Maybe if I responded to her message but I ended up ignoring that\u2026'She had the right to be a little surprised.\u201cI had to return for a bit on the 5th floor and just reached the 8th now. I actually only just returned today. And the message\u2026 I'm sorry. I must have missed it.\u201dOf course, I knew about the message.I was just never in a position to send a response.\u201cNo, no. It's nothing to apologize about. But why on the 5th\u2026?\u201d\u201cI can't go into detail, but it was just some personal business.\u201d\u201c\u2026I see. Well, that's not the important part. I'm glad that we both made it out of that tower alive.\u201dShe started smiling but her face froze once she realized something.\u201cDoes that mean you won't be climbing the tower anymore?\u201d\u201cNo, it's not that.\u201dI didn't even hesitate to answer that question.I'd already made my decision way before the 8th floor.'It's too late to take it back.'As soon as I felt the euphoria of winning and getting stronger\u2026I knew that choice had already been made for me.\u201cI'm planning to keep climbing the tower. Whatever it happens to be, it's an enticing place for me. And that's why I wanted to see you today.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cI don't have too much time left before having to return so I'll be direct. I need an organization.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by\u2026\u201d\u201cSomething that would help me go in and out of dungeons while still climbing the tower.\u201d\u201cI was wondering if you knew of any guilds or had connections that would agree to my terms.\u201dShe quieted down after hearing my request.I couldn't help but be disappointed after seeing her pause to think.'Was it too much?'I thought I had more expectations of this meeting than I'd realized.'Hunter association hunters have no choice but to respond to emergencies, but guilds are different.'Guilds are fantastic places where you can add as many arbitrary conditions as you'd like.I wanted to ask Lee Hayeon if she could introduce me to a guild that may agree to my conditions but\u2026Looking at her reaction, that might not be possible.'What can I do?'It was then.\u201c\u2026So what you want is to be able to freely enter dungeons as well as the tower?\u201dShe continued.\u201cI think I can assist with that.\u201d\u201cCan you refer me to a guild?\u201d\u201cHmm, something like that.\u201d\u201c\u2026?\u201d\u201cI'm currently the leader of the 'Challenger Supervision' team at the White Silver guild.\u201d\u201cThe challenger supervision team\u2026?\u201d\u201cOur goal is to recruit the challengers that have been summoned to the Tower of Trials.\u201dA challenger supervision team.'They already made something like that'I hadn't expected that.Even the hunter association hadn't figured out what they should be doing with the challengers as of now\u2026'No, maybe this makes the most sense.'This would be the prime time to recruit challengers since the association hasn't figured out a good way to do so.\u201cIf you join my team, I'll be able to fulfill most of your conditions. Although I'm not sure what I can do about money\u2026\u201d'What shall I do\u2026?'I didn't really care about the money.I'd already made 1.2 million from selling that gate.Plus, if I needed any more, I could sell some items from the tower.So\u2026'The conditions they're willing to fulfill will make or break this deal.'To what point would they accommodate me and if I'd be regretting it later.'And if neither requirements are met\u2026'I'd stop trying and just go back to climbing the tower.No matter what happened, I'll be able to prove my worth sooner or later.'I just don't like waiting too much.'Lee Hayeon carefully asked me the question as she sat down and stared at me.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But\u2026\u201d\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cI don't have the authority to give you access to our dungeons. Of course, you'll easily get the permission if you have the performance to back up your skills\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, and a team leader's word won't cut it for something like that.\u201dI understood.It meant that only a select minority could reap the benefits of the guild's dungeons.'Ideally, a promising young prospect.'But\u2026\u201cIf I can prove that I have the skills to use the dungeons, it would be a different story.\u201d\u201c\u2026You're more knowledgable than I thought. Yes, you're right.\u201d\u201cHow about my other two conditions?\u201d\u201cConsider it done. The challenger supervision team was created to support challengers like you.\u201dHmm, the deal sounded better than I thought.'I thought I might have been asking for too much\u2026'Maybe it was because of our brief encounter in the tower, but she seemed to be really accommodating towards me.Like she'd try everything in her power to get me whatever I wanted.I guess that shifted my mind towards joining her team.\u201cIf you can give me an opportunity to prove myself for dungeon access, I'll join your team.\u201dShe beamed in surprise.\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cI'll have to look over the written contract, but yes.\u201dThis was a calculated decision that I made by weighing all the pros and cons, but Lee Hayeon didn't seem to think so.\u201c\u2026You won't regret this.\u201dShe sounded genuinely touched by my decision.\u201cAs soon as the contract is signed, can you schedule an expedition for me to prove my performance?\u201d\u201cYou don't have to worry about that. I'll get a gate for you in no time.\u201dSatisfied, I let out another laugh.'This is going better than I thought.'Is it because I achieved almost everything I set out to do in just one day?The second return felt much more fruitful than the first already.The next day, I went to the cafe where we promised to meet.'Ideally, I would have preferred yesterday but\u2026'I shouldn't be too greedy.Lee Hayeon probably had her own things to do during the time she's back, and finding me a gate within a day wouldn't have been easy.Typically, they tended to take much longer.The only reason she was able to do so was that she held a leadership position in her guild.I knew that time was precious, but I wasn't the only one who thought so.I still had some time left before I had to go back, so there wasn't a need to rush her.Plus, yesterday was so productive that I felt like I had some wiggle room.I sat there waiting for a while before someone finally walked in.Di-ring\u2026The woman slicked her bangs behind her ear to reveal herself as Lee Hayeon.She looked around to find me sitting at a table.\u201cDid you, by chance, wait for me?\u201d\u201cEh, just a little bit. I had more time than I thought.\u201d\u201cAnd I thought I was early\u2026 Sorry for the wait.\u201d\u201cNo need for that. I see that you were quite busy.\u201dIt wasn't an exaggeration.No offense, but she looked terrible.Her eye bags were down to her cheeks and her hair was still wet from not drying it properly.\u201cHaha\u2026 Does it look like that? I might have stretched myself a little too thin.\u201dShe let out a bitter laugh as she took out a folder from her bag.\u201cTake a look. I wrote it up last night. The one next to it is our typical contract just for comparison.\u201dI opened up my contract and started reading.Flip, flip\u2026'Wow, what the\u2026?'The terms of the contract were eye-opening.'The base salary is $500,000, and everything I find in the dungeons would be my property.'I told her I didn't care that much about the money, but she probably still negotiated up anyway.Most hunters sold cores or whatever they tended to find in the dungeons through their guilds.Because of that, it's become standard practice for guilds to take a percentage of all loot in the dungeons\u2026But this contract had no mentions of that.Frankly, this contract was unbelievable.'Can refuse any summons by the guild and the guild cannot interfere in any activities within the tower\u2026'Every single one of my conditions was met.I was beyond satisfied, to the point of doubting if this was a real contract or not.Most importantly, the provision about getting dungeon access was included.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'If I can clear a C-rank dungeon by myself, I should be able to freely use all of the guild's dungeons\u2026?'That means\u2026The dungeon Lee Hayeon prepared for me is at least a C-rank.I'd been wanting to go into a higher-ranked dungeon.'Nice.'After looking over the document, I turned to Lee Hayeon and smiled.\u201cThere doesn't seem to be a problem with the contract.\u201d\u201cI'm glad. It makes my hard work feel worthwhile.\u201dShe seemed proud of herself as she asked a follow-up question.\u201cBy the way, do you have a hunter-license? If not, I can get you a temporary entrance pass\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I have one. I got registered the last time I came back.\u201d\u201cPerfect. It's currently hard to get one because the association has their eyes out for any challengers they could find.\u201dI knew that this would come in handy.'Nothing bad ever came out of being early.'I signed my name onto the contract and looked back up at her.\u201cSince the contract has been finalized, can we go to the testing dungeon now?\u201d\u201cOf course. We'll be going to a recently formed C-rank gate in the area.\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cI'll be there as an observer. Do you mind?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dI got up from my seat and gave her a faint smile.'This will probably be my last excursion.'My second return was already coming to an end.Uijeongbu Nogyang-dong, Chunbo Mountain.\u201cWe're finally here.\u201dWe didn't go far before getting out of the car.I got off from the passenger side and put my equipment back on.'A gate in the middle of a mountain\u2026'It was a little strange but I decided to not pay attention.Did these temporary gates even count as actual gates?There were a couple of people standing guard near the gates.Of course\u2026\u201cAh, you're team leader Lee Hayeon. Please continue.\u201dThere was no problem getting through.Step, step\u2026\u201cOh, I have to tell you this before we go in\u2026\u201d\u201cUnless something special happens, I won't be assisting you.\u201d\u201cYou're just here to observe and nothing else.\u201d\u201cYeah. It would be a problem if I helped and the guild doesn't accept this as proof of potential.\u201d\u201cI don't mind.\u201dIt's not like I'd ever received help to get to this point.Lee Hayeon should know that better than me.\u201cI know.\u201dShe nodded her head and continued to explain.\u201cThe test begins as soon as you get in. It's a temporary gate so we'll be killing the boss before coming out.\u201dI didn't think I needed to hear anything else.There was nothing special.\u201cOkay.\u201dIt didn't change the fact that all I had to do was kill everything in my way.Vooom\u2026!Grassy hills greeted me as I stepped through the gate.\u201cHm.\u201dThis could be a problem later on.In an open field like this, monsters tended to come at you from every direction.That meant the fight could evolve into a full-out brawl soon\u2026'A bit more difficult if I have to do that while protecting someone behind me.'Even if she was just an observer, it didn't exempt her from being one of the targets.And knowing her strengths, this wasn't a good environment for her either.She noticed my eyes shifting and addressed my unspoken concerns.\u201cDon't worry about me. I have an artifact that the guild gave me. It automatically protects me from attacks.\u201dShe showed me a necklace embedded with a cerulean gem.\u201cSo I wouldn't have to\u2026\u201d\u201cProtect me at all. It's an class item called 'Empress' necklace.' and it can absorb a decent amount of impact. It also has a slight concealment effect.\u201d\u201cThat's good news. I can fight without having to worry.\u201d\u201cAh, and I'll also be staying far away because taking aggro for you could count as helping.\u201dIt was then\u2014Kieeeeek\u2026!I shifted my attention to what sounded like nails scraping down a chalkboard.\u201cOoh\u2026\u201dI turned to see a turtle emitting a black fire from its mouth.\u201cIs that a starving flame demon?'They were a violent breed that some even called the 'small devil.'Unlike their turtle-like appearance, they were very agile and emitted a powerful flame breath.Also, they were typically so sturdy that hunters tended to avoid them, but\u2026'Now they're just souls to be consumed by my necromancy.'It was time to get stronger again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That's not a coincidence.\u201d\u201cOnce you don't perform well in a trial, your difficulty level adjusts.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d\u201cThe information should be pretty accurate since we learned it from interviewing other challengers.\u201dShe continued to explain.\u201cSo basically\u2026\u201dIn essence, this is what she said.In the easy difficulty, challengers who cleared their trials with outstanding performance tended to struggle with subsequent trials\u2026And people who struggled to clear the objective said their trials became progressively easier to clear.Plus, the contents of the trial itself started to change depending on the person.\u201cThat's what happened to me. My trials started out as battles but later became more focused around exploring and finding my way out of a labyrinth.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cOn the other hand, if you perform well, the trials would get harder and tend towards battles.\u201d\u201cBut your rewards would be better.\u201d\u201cThere hasn't been a case like that from the easy difficulty mode challengers but\u2026 that should be the case.\u201dThat probably meant my difficulty had been increasing because of my performance in previous trials.That wasn't all bad though.It just meant that I'd have an easier time getting stronger.\u201cWhat you just demonstrated should only be possible by the top 50 rankers\u2026 and the more trials you go through, the stronger you'll get. You're one of the few people who are voluntarily climbing the tower.\u201dMost people bought the permanent return stone and left the tower.I nodded my head.\u201c\u2026I see.\u201d\u201cOf course, it will be that much more dangerous. So please be careful.\u201d\u201cI want to stay by your side to see how much stronger you'd get.\u201dShe smiled with a blush.\u201cI'm rooting for you, not as your contractor, but as a fellow hunter.\u201d\u201c\u2026I think I know what you're worried about. But don't worry.\u201dI knew the type of people who were left in the tower.And I was just like them.\u201cWe aren't that different.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cI guess that's a relief. Now let's get going. The dungeon is going to expunge soon.\u201dI nodded and followed her out of the boss room.That was how my second day back ended.After completing the dungeon\u2026I spent my day lazing around.\u300c The Hunter Association has announced the 'Tower of Trials' as a disaster that\u2026 \u300d\u300c Tower of Trials, what is it? A turning point for everyday civilians? \u300d\u300c There are currently many easy and normal difficulty level challengers being confirmed\u2026 \u300dThere was still some to be dug up.And\u2014\u300c Bank account \u2013 $1,232,630 \u300d\u201cIt's real\u2026\u201dAll the money I made since I came back was already deposited into my account.'It's more than I thought.'Even without the gate, just selling the cores was pretty profitable.Plus, if I kept working as a hunter, I'd be making much more than this.But\u2026'I'm not gonna stop here.'It would be foolish to throw away an opportunity to get even stronger.And then\u2014Bzzzt\u2026!The phone I left at the side of my desk started buzzing.There was only one person who would be texting me.'Lee Hayeon.'My prediction was spot on.\u300c All the necessary paper was has been processed.

So you were the pioneer 'hunter.'\u201d\u201cI was wondering what kind of monster you were, but you look quite normal.\u201dI glared at her to protest the sudden judgment of my appearance.\u201c\u2026Do you know me?\u201dStill sitting on the table, she crossed her legs and answered my question.\u201cOf course. You proved yourself worthy on the 4th floor. I'd need to live under a rock to not know about your ostentatious debut.\u201dMy performance on the 4th floor seemed to have garnered some attention.'Maybe\u2026?'\u201cHave you been watching my trials this entire time?\u201d\u201cI knew from the leaderboard. It's not possible to spectate challengers below the 8th floor.\u201d\u201cYou seem to be misunderstanding something here. Administrators aren't god-like beings. We also don't control anything that happens in the tower.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mea\u2026\u201d\u201cIt's more accurate to say that those who are bound to the tower become administrators. So don't be nervous. As long as I'm bound to the tower, I won't be able to hurt you.\u201dShe said all this as if she knew that I was nervous.\u201cWell, logistics aside\u2026 this meeting is a perk given only to pioneers. Ask me anything you are curious about.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksI didn't exactly understand everything but I got the basic idea.Administrators weren't all-powerful, and they were just bound to the tower.And\u2026'I guess she has no intentions of hurting me?'I didn't sense any animosity at all.Maybe even to the point of being friendly.When I realized this, I didn't hold back.\u201cCan you tell me exactly what this is?\u201dThe finger twirling her silver hair stopped moving and she smiled smugly.\u201cYou adapt pretty fast. I mean, I guess that's how you survived.\u201d\u201cAs I said, the consultation is a perk given to pioneers. You may ask administrators questions without explicitly using your 'questions.'\u201d\u201cIs that it?\u201d\u201cWell, there are a few more advantages. One is being able to meet an administrator face-to-face, and you can end up getting another 'perk' from the administrator.\u201dMight as well make the most of this then.\u201cThen can you tell me what a challenger from another world is?\u201d\u201cDid you already run into that\u2026? You've had quite the experience.\u201dShe scowled her brows as if she knew something.I narrowed my eyes and continued with the question.\u201cI almost died to one on the 5th trial.\u201d\u201cAnd yet you're still alive\u2026 I guess you're resilient to misfortunes. Well, it's not really that big of a secret.\u201dLooking pleasantly surprised, she opened her mouth.\u201cYou probably found out from the guy you met but\u2026 The Tower of Trials isn't just in this world. Other worlds have the same tower, and the challenger you met is from one of them.\u201dShe said it like it was no big deal, but it wasn't news to be taken lightly.'I guess other worlds do exist\u2026'And those worlds also have towers with challengers just like us.It was difficult to accept but the existence of the tower wasn't logical, to begin with.But\u2026I had a follow-up question.\u201cThen why did he come to me? Shouldn't he have been able to intrude on someone from his own world?\u201d\u201cYeah, but he chose to come to a different world for a reason.\u201dShe continued with a light smile.\u201cAnd that reason is that once you go to a different world, you can steal that floor's rewards.\u201d\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201d\u201cNot only that, they can get an even better reward than the one originally promised to you.\u201d\u201cThose challengers come from a world where the tower has existed for decades. That also means they're all knowledgable about the immense rewards that the tower provides.\u201d\u201cAnd that's not all.\u201d\u201cThis world's tower will merge with those of other world's.\u201d\u201c\u2026What does that mean?\u201d\u201cIt's as I said. After the 20th floor, trials will tend towards group challenges, rather than individual, and you will meet with challengers from another world.\u201d\u201cAnd they determined that killing challengers from a primitive dimension like Earth would be beneficial in future trials.\u201dThe only thing I could do after hearing that was sigh.'I'll be competing against other worlds' challengers after the 20th floor\u2026'It was definitely an idea easier to wrap my head around since I had already met one on the 5th floor.\u201cYou don't look too shocked. Doesn't this come to you as a surprise?\u201dI swayed my head.\u201c\u2026No, I'm stunned. I am shocked at the concept of other worlds and I'm dismayed about the fact that I'll have to face challengers from them later on.\u201d\u201cYou don't seem surprised.\u201d\u201cWhat am I supposed to do about it? I have to accept it and prepare for it.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026 I guess you can think of it like that. I see.\u201dShe looked at me like an exotic animal, but that's how I really felt.It wasn't like anything else that had happened made sense to me.\u201cAre you satisfied now?\u201d\u201cI have one last question.\u201dAnother question I had for a while.\u201cWhat exactly is the tower?\u201dWhile climbing, I got used to receiving all kinds of rewards from the tower but\u2026That was one question I couldn't erase.\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd what's at the end of the tower?\u201d\u201cThat's something I can't tell you.\u201d'I thought you were bound to the tower. How can you not know something like that?\u201d\u201cIt's entirely possible. Seeing that I'm also relatively a newcomer to the tower.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cAdministrators were all once challengers as well.\u201dShe continued to explain.\u201cAt one point, I climbed above and beyond the 20th floor but\u2026 I still couldn't reach the top of the tower. No, not just me\u2014 all administrators died before reaching the top of the tower. That's how you become an administrator.\u201dThis was the summary of her explanation.After reaching the 40th floor, challengers gained the ability to be resurrected as an administrator after death.\u201cFor your information, I reached the 47th floor. And I lost on pure dumb luck.

There's a couple of them, and discipleship is the most relevant to challengers.\u201d\u201cWhen you say discipleship, is it a subordination contract\u2026?\u201dWhen she was how taken aback I was by the idea, she swayed her head.\u201cA discipleship is just how challengers can receive sponsorship from administrators.\u201d\u201cSponsorship\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd when the challenger grows stronger and climbs higher, the sponsoring administrator receives perks from the tower.\u201d\u201cIs that it? Are there any other conditions?\u201d\u201cI don't know about on our end, but there's nothing really on the challenger's end. Although, there is one condition that we're both subject to.\u201d\u201cOnce the contract is complete, neither the challenger nor the administrator can form discipleship contracts with anyone else.\u201d\u201cThat's all?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dIt made sense.The tower probably had a reason for the meetings with the admins.Everything she said didn't seem made up, and she seemed to be telling the truth.There was a chance she was trying to trick me, but it didn't seem likely.Rather than a trick, this felt more like yet another attempt from the tower to strengthen the challengers.I had my suspicions, but not to the point of disbelief.But I still had to make sure that this wasn't an elaborate illusion.\u201cFirst of all, can you tell me what exactly is this 'sponsorship'?\u201d\u201cOnce you finalize the contract, you can unlock something called an 'exclusive marketplace' where you can purchase special skills or powers.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cI can sponsor the special points that are used as the currency in that store and you can also get these points every time you clear a trial.\u201d\u201cHmmm\u2026\u201d\u201cI guess there might be a couple of details I missed but\u2026 That's about it. Discipleship with other administrators wouldn't be any different either.\u201d\u201cI see\u2026\u201dI stood still thinking about the consequences of my decision.Would there be any problems that might arise later?Plus\u2026'Am I on the losing end of this deal somehow?'I thought about it, but it didn't seem like there was a way for me to lose anything.And the tower always rewarded risks.'The meeting with the administrator was supposed to be a reward. This shouldn't harm me in any way.'After coming to a conclusion, I looked her in the eyes and started speaking.\u201cWould it be possible to meet with other administrators?\u201d\u201cNo. Well, maybe later but\u2026\u201d\u201cIt's basically impossible at my current state.\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201dWe sat in silence for a bit until I nodded.\u201cI'll do it.\u201dNone of it seemed like a lie, and I didn't want to miss out on a perk because I was suspicious or wanted to find another administrator.\u201cThat was quick. Do you trust me?\u201d\u201cYou did say that you were bound to the tower.\u201dAnd it was a privilege for only the pioneers.\u201cHmmmm\u2026 You're smarter than I thought. No, maybe it's just your instincts?\u201dShe licked her lips sensually.\u201cI can't miss out on a competent and gutsy challenger.\u201dShe looked at me like she was looking at a piece of well-marbled meat for some reason, but\u2026I tried to be as stoic as possible.\u201cAre we agreeing to a contract then?\u201d\u201cYes, from this point on, I will be your sponsor.\u201dIt was then.\u300c Do you agree to enter a sponsorship contract? \u300dI clicked 'accept' without hesitation and\u2026\u300c The contract has been officiated. \u300d\u300c The contract exclusive marketplace and SP (special points) have been unlocked. \u300d\u300c You are the first party that administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch's' has contracted with. \u300d\u300c As the first contractee, all your stats increase by +1. \u300dMessages popped up and covered my field of vision.'Is this what a contract is supposed to be\u2026'After scrolling down, I even saw that each of my stats was increased by 1.'She said that administrators couldn't be in contract with more than one challenger at once\u2026'This probably meant that the contract becomes void once the challenger dies.As I was reading the messages\u2014\u300c Confirmed that the meeting with the administrator has ended. \u300d\u300c You will soon move to the waiting room. \u300dThe Iron-blooded Monarch glared at the message as the tower cut our time short.\u201cHm\u2026 I guess we've run out of time. It was fun, pioneer. I'll see you later.\u201dBefore I could even respond, my surroundings changed again.\u300c You have entered the 8th floor waiting room. \u300dI was left with a weird sense of peculiarness as my dream-like meeting ended.The fact that I'd have to fight challengers from another world after the 20th floor sounded like a fairy tale.'Did I really enter a contract with an administrator\u2026?'But\u2026\u201cExclusive Marketplace.\u201d\u300c Contract Exclusive Marketplace \u300d\u300c SP \u2013 1000 \u300d\u300c Category: Skills \u300d\u300c Category: Powers \u300d\u300c Category: Items \u300d\u300c Contractor: Iron-blooded Monarch \u300d\u300c Note: Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch's' first contractor. \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cI guess it wasn't a dream\u2026\u201dThe reality of my meeting finally set in as I opened my new marketplace.'I really did get into a contract with her\u2026'It was like an illusionary bubble popped and I was snapped back into reality.This was all real.The Iron-blooded Monarch, and our contract.And\u2026'The fact that intruders will start invading us.'She said that intruders could take our trial rewards for themselves.That meant we'd start running into more and more challengers.\u201cGod damn it\u2026\u201dI sighed, but switched my attention to the panel in front of me.My head was filled with thoughts about what I could go through in the future but\u2026Honestly, nothing had changed.I was set on climbing the tower.And I was prepared to face intruders along the way.Then there was no extra decision to be made.\u300c Browsing the 'Category: Powers' tab of the exclusive marketplace. \u300d'First, I have to get stronger.'Enough to be able to crush whatever gets in my way.\u300c Category: Powers \u300d\u300c Listing (1/3) \u300d\u300c Power: Serenity (C-) \u300d\u300c Power: Iron Soul () \u300d\u300c Power: Winter King (D+) \u300d\u201cThere's not as many as I thought.\u201dPowers were one of the things that the tower gave us when we got our radiances.Well, what we got were 'innate powers' which might be a little different but\u2014They both seemed to be powers of some sort.'I thought they'd be more useful than skills but\u2026'Most of the powers had a pretty low rank as well.One difference was that the 'innate power' that I got with the radiance didn't have a rank, but these did.'Is there a difference between the two?'I wanted to get a look at the other options before I read any details but\u2026\u300c You currently do not possess the authority to open listing (2/3). \u300d\u300c You may browse listing (2/3) starting from the 10th floor. \u300d\u201cWhat the\u2026\u201dI wasn't even allowed to look through all of them.And then I finally read the notes on the bottom.\u300c (!)

Initially, the only powers you can browse are those of your contracted administrator. \u300d\u300c (!)

All weapons skill proficiency increases 2.32 times faster. New weapons skills start out at 10% proficiency. \u300d\u201cOoh\u2026\u201dNow, this was a battle-related skill.The option for the proficiency increase was amazing but the extra 10% on all weapons skills really caught my eye.'My Hunter's Daggermanship skill recently reached its limit too\u2026'I couldn't help but be drawn to it knowing that all new weapons skills I created would get an extra 10% proficiency.But\u2026'I don't have nearly enough SP.'After all, I only had 1,000 in my possession.Regrettably, I scrolled to the next power.\u300c Power: Winter King (D+) \u300d\u300c Price: 800 SP \u300d\u300c Explanation: A power found in some leaders of the north. Your stats temporarily increase in the cold and you do not take damage from the cold. \u300d\u201cIt's umm\u2026?\u201dThe last one didn't seem that good either.It technically had a battle-related component but\u2026It only activates in the cold?'I guess it's technically an immunity of some sorts, but it's not widely applicable.'I wasn't really drawn to it either.'What should I buy\u2026'It would be best to buy something right now so I wouldn't go into the next trial empty-handed.'This might be my best bet\u2026'I finally made my decision.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I can't force you to be respectful.\u201dIn an instant, the old man's atmosphere sharpened and\u2026Shssst\u2014!\u201cGoodbye, nameless swordsman.\u201dHe swung his sword cleanly at the empty space in front of him.My confusion didn't last very long.\u300c Your vision is blinded by the innate ability 'Sword Flash.' \u300dThe man's sword flashed with a bright white light and blinded me.'What the\u2026!'As if to undermine my decision to put some distance between us, the flash took away my ability to react to any of his attacks.Of course\u2026\u300c Activating the skill 'Mana Resistance.' \u300d\u300c The blindness duration has been reduced to 2.5 seconds. \u300dMy mana circuit and resistance activated and reduced the effectiveness but\u2026It didn't matter that much against a ridiculous ability like blinding.It was then\u2014\u300c Activating the skill 'Mind's Eye.' \u300dEverything changed when the skill I obtained from the dungeon boss activated.I was able to feel his blade rapidly approaching my throat.'Nice\u2026!'I relied heavily on this feeling and tried to react to the best of my ability.Even though I couldn't gauge an accurate distance or see his body,It was still enough.Slaaash\u2014!\u201cUgh!\u201dI twisted my torso at the very moment the blade tried to pierce my throat and managed to dodge it.\u300c Achievement 'Blind Evasion' unlocked. \u300d\u300c Agility increased by 2. \u300dI couldn't dodge it completely and the blade slightly grazed my neck, but it wasn't something to worry about.\u300c Innate ability 'Sword Flash's effect has concluded. \u300d\u201cWhat\u2026?\u201dThe first thing I saw as I gained sight again was a flustered face.He must have been shocked that his attack didn't work but\u2026\u300c Activating the skill 'Ashen Blood.' \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Instant Acceleration.' \u300dI healed the scratch on my neck as I counter-attacked with an attack of my own.Fwoosh\u2014!Ripping the air in front of me, I lunged forward as the old man almost glided back from surprise.\u201c\u2026How did you know?\u201dI had no reason to answer this either.It was a waste of my breath.I looked him directly in the eye and said the only thing I needed to say.\u201cWind's Blessing.\u201d\u300c Activating the skill 'Wind's Blessing.' \u300d\u300c All speeds increased by 30%. \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

my right hand.\u201cYou evil demon\u2026\u201d!The old man finally gave up on trying to make me talk and bit his lip as he fended off my swing.Clang!The blades collided and sparks flew out between us.He monotonously nullified my attack with his own.And from the looks of his trembling fingers, the difference in our stats wasn't very big.'I don't overpower him with all my stat boosts?'Even the black knight couldn't do anything with my stats that were boosted by necromancy\u2026This self-proclaimed Murim elder was different.Even if he did use both of his hands, the fact that I couldn't push him back meant his stats were much higher than I expected.That wasn't all.Even though he wasted his breath by asking me useless questions, he wasn't out of breath at all.Compared to me, I may be the one who was out of breath.'Is it a difference in technique?'I thought my swordsmanship wasn't all that bad, especially with my weapons skill\u2026This otherworldly challenger was in a league of his own.'An experienced swordsman with similar stats\u2026'I suddenly felt a lick of chill down my back.The old man exuded bloodlust from his eyes as he muttered in a cold voice.\u201cI'll get serious

than before.\u300c The skill 'Mind's Eye' is currently activated. \u300dThe Mind's Eye skill allows me to 'perceive attacks from outside my range of vision.'And because this ability completely blocked my field of vision, I was able to perceive attacks from all directions.Even then, the old man's attacks were ferocious.Shhhhsst\u2014!He ripped through the air as if he didn't even want to hide his attacks anymore.I was relying on the Mind's Eye to dodge, but the attacks weren't slowing down.'How is his attack speed so high\u2026?'I must have dodged seven different swings but the blindness was still effective.That means the old man swung seven times within a 2.5 second time frame.And all my speeds were increased by 30% with the Wind's Blessing.That included an attack speed boost, and he easily matched that.'No, he was overpowering it\u2026!'\u300c Innate ability 'Sword Flash's effect has concluded. \u300dClaaaang\u2014!The sound of two metals clashing filled the whole colosseum.I instinctually swung my sword at the incoming blade as soon as my sight came back but\u2026The old man seemed to have expected that and used the rebound to counter-attack.It was an insane combo that combined his insane attack speed with increased momentum.'I can't dodge this.'After determining that, I raised the shield that was attached to my left hand.Of course, I knew that I wouldn't be able to block that with just a shield.It was my last-ditch effort to reduce some of the damage.The old man seemed to know this as well and accelerated his attack.But\u2026\u300c Activating Wrought Iron

much more skilled than me and his stats were comparable to mine.And his innate ability was so broken that I couldn't get a good attack in.I could deal with his attacks but I couldn't control the flow of the battle.'If the fight continues like this it'll be my loss.'Ashen Blood's healing effect wasn't infinite.The old man scowled as he saw my arm heal.\u201cYou must be using some sort of demon-arts to heal all of your injuries.\u201dI didn't reply and instead moved my hand over to grip my sword with both hands.I might as well since my shield was beyond usable.\u201cI thought you were a decent martial artist but you must be using borrowed powers\u2026\u201dWas the innate ability that he used not given to him by the tower?If he was using skills to move, was he not using demon-arts?'What a

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 59: The Murim Challenger (3)Murim Alliance Elder Baek Sunhak was stunned for the first time in a while.And the reason?The man standing in front of him, being caressed by the winds.It was unnatural.He was different from all the other challengers that he'd faced before.Fwoosh\u2014!You could tell just by looking at the winds surrounding him.Whatever he was doing was on an entirely different level than before\u2026He had been considering this 'Earth' world as a training ground.Everyone from this place had been abnormally weak.Because they had no previous knowledge of martial arts, they only used the abilities gained in the tower.Before he had lost all his power, Baek Sunhak was one of the best fighters in his world.Seeing the powerless buffoons of Earth, he knew that none of them would last that long.Challengers from other worlds also noticed this and started looting Earth.\u300c Activating trial intrusion. \u300d\u300c Upon killing the challenger, you may steal their rewards. \u300dBut Baek Sunhak had never once failed an intrusion.Not a single challenger had even met his expectations.He'd already killed two challengers from this world and took their rewards.So surely, this one wouldn't have been any different.His innate ability, 'Sword Flash,' immediately blinded his opponent's field of vision\u2026He was able to assassinate people simply by silently stabbing their throats.No one had been able to react to that.That was the reason Baek Sunhak was able to keep his composure and ask for an introduction.But\u2026'Who the hell is he\u2026!'The young man standing in front of him was different.With both eyes disabled, he was able to not only dodge but also counterattack.That alone assured Baek Sunhak that not everyone in this world was as weak as he had made them out to be.But that should have been his limit.No one should be able to match him once he had gotten serious.But things didn't go about how he expected.Claaaash\u2014!A loud crash echoed throughout the trial as the young man kicked the ground.And at the same time\u2014\u300c Acceleration increased for a moment due to the effects of Boots of Swiftness (C+). \u300dFor an instant, he was so fast that even Baek Sunhak couldn't follow him with his eyes.He knew that he was up to something when the winds wrapped around him but\u2026Whatever demon art he used, this speed was nothing to scoff at.But he couldn't be surprised for too long.Clang\u2014!He had to do something about the young man's attacks.The increased attack speed made it harder for him to keep up, but Baek Sunhak was a distinguished martial artist.Chaaang\u2026!The fruits of his training suppressed the young man's swordsmanship and countered all of his blows.In his prime, he was once one of the top 10 swordsmen in his world.He caused disruptions to the flow of his blade to form all sorts of sword feints.The seven feints prevented the young man from his barrage but\u2026As if the feints were too slow, the young man just took a step back to remove himself from the range of the feints.Reacting swiftly, Baek Sunhak activated his innate ability.\u300c Innate ability 'Sword Flash's' cooldown has ended. \u300d\u300c Activating innate ability 'Sword Flash.' \u300dIn an instant, his sword flashed brightly and blinded the young man's eyes.But instead of just dodging, the young man started to attack even more ferociously.\u300c Activating the skill 'Mind's Eye.' \u300dThis was the result of him getting used to Baek Sunhak's innate ability.The young man dodged a jab aimed at his head and got in close.Ch-ch-chang!Whether this was demon arts or something else, Baek Sunhak had to acknowledge him now.'What went wrong\u2026!?'He should have killed him the first time he had been affected by his innate ability.His swordsmanship wasn't anything special, but Baek Sunhak was starting to fall behind.For starters, their physical abilities were about the same before the winds had wrapped around the young man.And even if he did manage to get a blow in, it didn't matter.\u300c The skill 'Ashen Blood' is activated. \u300dThe young man's body healed all his injuries as if they never happened.'What kind of monster\u2026'Getting a clean hit was hard enough already, so nullifying it?Baek Sunhak's techniques were clearly superior but\u2026The main problem was the skill he had to counteract the effects of his innate ability.Baek Sunhak was too proud to use the skills that he had received from the tower but\u2026It was better than dying.\u300c Activating the skill 'One Stone Two Birds.' \u300d\u300c Attack speed increased by 2 times. \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Lighting Blade Ki.' \u300d\u300c Lightning encases your blade. \u300dKrrrrr\u2026!Blade Ki, rare even in the murim world, was the telltale the main sign of a top-tier martial artist.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThat ability was about to be performed by Baek Sunhak but\u2026\u300c Trial intrusion penalty is active. \u300d\u300c All stats are reduced by -8. \u300d\u300c Certain skills are disabled. \u300dThe tower forbade it from activating.\u300c The skill 'One Stone Two Birds' is forcefully deactivated. \u300d\u300c The skill 'Lightning Blade Ki' is forcefully deactivated. \u300dKangg\u2026!\u201cUgh\u2026!\u201dBaek Sunhak's wrists vibrated as he fended off another blow.\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' is astonished by the young challenger. \u300dThe administrator that he formed a contract with was chiming in all of a sudden.Not only that.\u300c Administrator 'Monster of the North' predicts your loss. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Tyrant of the Night' is interested in the young challenger. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Hero of the Black Archipelago' admires the young challenger's skill use. \u300dThe other administrators who had been observing him also showed interest in the young man in front of him.Hence, this man was well beyond a typical challenger.'Damn\u2026'Baek Sunhak felt the sweat drip down his back as he tried to think of any skill he could currently use.Thinking he could still pull ahead, Baek Sunhak pushed more ki into his sword.Even though he wasn't able to use sword ki, it would still strengthen his sword.Fwing\u2026!Seeing a blue fog rise up from his sword, Baek Sunhak went on the offensive.\u300c Innate ability 'Sword Flash's cooldown has ended. \u300d\u300c Activating innate ability 'Sword Flash.' \u300dAfter activating his innate ability, he mustered up the few skills that he could actually use.\u300c Activating the skill 'Single Cut.' \u300d\u300c Your next ability with a blade has increased cutting force by 2 times. \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Fairy Steps.' \u300d\u300c Increases movement speed by 2.8 times for 1 minute. \u300dTo prepare for his one, last-ditch effort.He even raised his movement speed to catch up with his opponent.Shaaaek\u2014!The young man didn't back down from this clash.This was when Baek Sunhak smiled as he anticipated his victory.All he had to do was cut him in half, straight through his sword.'It's done. It's finally ov\u2026?'But\u2026\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dContrary to his belief, Baek Sunhak wasn't able to slice through the young challenger's sword.\u300c Activating the skill 'Triple Laceration.' \u300d\u300c Your next three attacks are strengthened. \u300dThe young challenger's sword was also overflowing with mana.Clang\u2014!I felt chills down my spine after blocking the old man's latest attack.'Holy sh\u2026'Right before going blind, I saw a blue fog around his sword.Because it was similar to the 'aura' that the black knight used on the 5th trial, I deliberately activated Triple Laceration.And thank goodness that I did.Even with enough force to obliterate a sand golem, the old man's sword didn't budge\u2026That's just how impressive the old man was.'I would have died if I didn't use my skill\u2026'My throat suddenly felt cold after realizing how close I was to death.If he had sliced through my sword, my neck would have followed closely behind.I knew my limbs would reattach with relative ease, but I wasn't sure about my head.\u300c Innate ability 'Sword Flash's effect has concluded. \u300dAnd as soon as my sight returned\u2026I was greeted by a shocked old man.That was of no concern to me.I knocked his sword aside and took another swing at him.Triple Laceration gets stronger with each attack.Hence, if the first one was just about equal to his blue ki\u2026Skaaaak\u2026!My second blow shattered his blade into pieces.He may not have expected my attack to shatter his sword because, as his sword broke, he was unable to pull back in time\u2026And the tip of my sword gouged into his chest.\u201ca\u2026\u201dHe stumbled back and coughed up a bit of blood, but I wasn't going to take pity.The old man had the ability to fend off an attack from my Laceration.If he had anything like that left in his arsenal, I could fall to it.At this point, it was kill or be killed.So I swung my sword without hesitation and\u2026\u300c Deactivating the skill 'Triple Laceration.' \u300dShaaaak\u2014!\u201cNo, unbelie\u2026\u201dSplit in half, the old man was unable to finish his sentence before he ended up on the floor.And\u2026\u300c Congratulations. You have overcome the Tower of Trials floor 9. \u300dMy smile couldn't be contained as I read the declaration of my victory.After another close fight, the exhilaration of the battle was overwhelming.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

These fuckers are all Korean. And isn't that one an A rank hunter?\u201d\u201cDamn, I thought Korea was supposed to be a hunter stronghold or something. I guess even they couldn't do anything about the tower.\u201d\u201cThey were talking like they were so much better than China and now look at them. Fuckin' slimy ass turds\u2026\u201d\u300c Mana cost is increased by 100% due to innate ability 'Weakening Light's effect. \u300d\u300c All stats decrease by 20% due to innate ability 'Territorize's effect. \u300d\u300c Parts of your body become paralyzed due to innate ability 'Eye of Fear's effect. \u300dThe other challengers who were summoned in the alley used all kinds of debuffs to restrict Lee Sungjin's movements.'What the fuck\u2026?'He was certain that something bad was about to happen.In an area with just 6 people, three of them suddenly activated their innate abilities.Lee Sungjin remembered reading something about having to walk a little bit before reaching the area with all the people in the public area.Hence, no one would know if a murder occurred here.\u201c\u2026W-Wait a minute. What do you think you're doing?\u201dStartled, Lee Sungjin interrogated the three challengers but\u2026\u201cWho knows\u2026? What do you think we're doing? Why don't you think hard about it?\u201d\u201cThere's no way someone from the hunter stronghold of the world wouldn't know, right?\u201d\u201cHaha, of course. He's Korean.\u201dThe three only mocked him.'Ah, I think I'm fucked\u2026'It was true.Lee Sungjin was an rank hunter before he came into the tower.With all the experience he had dealing with other hunters, he knew what was about to go down.'They're doing this here\u2026? Not even in a trial\u2026?'They must be trying to kill or neutralize us before taking what they want from us.The woman standing behind Lee Sungjin started speaking.\u201cI-It sounds like you're Chinese from your language but\u2026 do you think you can handle it? If we expose you in the community right now it won't go over well.\u201dLee Sungjin realized that was also an option just then, but that didn't seem to change their minds.\u201cAnd how effective do you think that will be? And even if you can get this news out of the tower, why would anyone believe you over us?\u201dAs if they didn't mind murder as long as it wouldn't cause problems in the outside world.\u201cWell, that doesn't mean we'll kill you all.\u201d\u201cIf you drop all your equipment and do as we say, we'll let at least one of you live.\u201dLee Sungjin couldn't help but grimace at their crude tone.Not only that\u2026\u300c Administrator 'Black Devil' is keenly observing this situation. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Glutton' tells you to take your hands off their contractor. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Black Devil' laughs and says sucks to suck. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Glutton' warns their contractor to back off. \u300dLee Sungjin's administrator 'Glutton' told the Chinese challenger's administrator off, to no avail.'What should I do\u2026?'He couldn't figure out a good way to diffuse the situation.The woman standing behind him took a couple of steps back in fear as well.\u201cShall we continue this conversation after you disarm yourselves?\u201dAs the challenger smirked\u2014\u201cHow about we don't?\u201dThe man in the black robe who was standing silently the whole time finally spoke up.\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cI said I don't think we should.\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you know what you're saying right now?\u201d\u201cObviously. I'm saying that we don't have to sit here and listen to your dumbass threats.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ha, hahaha. That's funny.\u201dBut his face didn't look very amused.The aggravated challenger eyed the other two challengers and continued in a cold voice.\u201cI wonder if you'll still think that even after you die.\u201dThe worst possible situation seemed inevitable, and Lee Sungjin tensed up.'I guess I have to fight\u2026!?'But something unexpected happened.Taaang\u2026!\u300c Activating the power 'Sword Ki Master.' \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Instant Acceleration.' \u300dSliiit\u2014!\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dThe agitated challenger's head was flying through the air in a blink of an eye.By none other than the man in the black robe.Honestly, I had had high expectations for the public area.It was finally an opportunity to meet other challengers in a non-trial environment\u2026And that could lead to some proper interactions.But\u2026'More of these people\u2026 I'm so sick of it.'The little expectations I had were completely shattered as soon as I entered.I couldn't even imagine that challengers from other countries would try to loot items from us.Disappointment aside, I just didn't like these people.Threatening people to get what they want\u2026One of my main skills, 'Wind's Blessing,' was on cooldown but\u2026\u300c Activating the skill 'Forceful Breakthrough.' \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Mana Resistance.' \u300dThey weren't even otherworldly challengers.These small fries were a joke at this point.\u300c Mana cost increase by 100% has been canceled. \u300d\u300c Stats decrease by 20% has been canceled. \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u300c The paralysis effect has been canceled. \u300d'Easy.'I cleansed the debuffs off and I felt like myself again.\u300c Activating the power 'Sword Ki Master.' \u300dSlaaaat\u2014!After decapitating the one standing in the front\u2026I pushed myself a little faster to run to the other two.\u201cW-What the fu\u2026! Lightning spe\u2014!\u201dSsssggt\u2026!I sliced in half the guy who was about to activate a skill and\u2026\u201cE-Eeek! D-don't ki\u2026!\u201dThud\u2026!I kicked the other one who threw away his weapon and conceded.He flew backward and wallowed in the pain as if a bone had broken.\u201cAghhhh\u2026!\u201dJudging from his face, a broken rib must have punctured one of his organs.Seeing the tears drop from his bloodshot eyes disgusted me.He was laughing right before he was about to commit murder but\u2026Did he not think that he had this coming?\u201cGhughhhh. P-Please\u2026 G-Give me a cha\u2026\u201dBut I obviously didn't and walked over to give him his finishing blow.Tup.\u201c\u2026\u201dWas it because I barely felt anything now?\u300c Achievement 'Fight Fire With Fire' unlocked. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 1. \u300dIt left a bitter taste in my mouth that I was so desensitized to death.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is satisfied with their contractor's audacity. \u300dOf course, the Iron-blooded Monarch seemed to like that.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Hyun Moojin'. \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Lee Chunjin'. \u300d\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Nam Jinhyun'. \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 6.4% \u300dThey must not have been that strong if it didn't raise my proficiency by that much\u2026But just their equipment should make this worth it.'Anyway, I wanted to see how powerful the Sword Ki was but\u2026'They weren't strong enough to serve as a gauge.'Well, I'll get another chance sometime soon.'Whether it's back on Earth or here.I turned around, putting my regrets aside.Then\u2026\u201cW-Would you happen to be a ranker\u2026?\u201dOne of the people who was threatened with me was staring.Like he didn't believe how quickly this situation resolved itself.\u201cA ranker\u2026 well, I guess you could call me that.\u201dI was always in the top 10 during the trial evaluations, so I figured I qualified to be one.\u201cI-I see. It's an honor to meet you. Thank you for your assistance.\u201dAfter the man thanked me, the woman followed suit.\u201cS-Sorry. I should have helped but\u2026 it ended faster than I expected\u2026\u201dI didn't do it for them.\u201cIt's nothing.\u201dI didn't have a savior complex and I wasn't here to save anyone.They just happened next to me when I was threatened and defended myself.\u201cYou can go now.\u201d\u201cYes? B-But as thanks\u2026\u201d\u201cIt's fine. You can just go.\u201d\u201cAh, okay\u2026\u201dThe female challenger seemed like she wanted to do something in return but\u2026I honestly didn't really want anything from her.Besides, I doubt it would have been anything that helpful.As I was about to walk over to the corpses on the floor\u2014\u201cE-Excuse me\u2026\u201dA small voice behind me caught my attention.\u201cAre you still here?\u201dI stared at the male challenger who hadn't moved yet.'What? I told him I didn't need anything.'The suspicious challenger opened his mouth.\u201cAh, well, I just wanted to give\u2026\u201d\u201cI said it was fine. Don't worry about it.\u201d\u201cT-Then how about this?\u201d\u201cCan you let me have the corpses?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2026\u201dHe didn't even lift a finger when I was tearing through them.I frowned at the bullshit he called a proposition.\u201cSorry, I don't think\u2026\u201d\u201cIn return, I'll give you a power through my administrator.\u201d\u201cSounds good.\u201dThe male challenger widened his eyes in surprise.\u201cOh? R-Really?\u201dI was serious.I didn't care about other things, but a power was something else.A power for three measly corpses?I was definitely not on the losing end of this deal.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' admires your quick change of heart. \u300dThe Iron-blooded Monarch admired this, but this was how humans are.\u201cI'll take the power as long as you tell me what it does. I'll decide what to do after that.\u201d\u300c Administrator 'Glutton' smiles at your wit. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' watches this situation with interest. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Black Devil' is sick of your good fortune. \u300d'What?'The continuous wall of messages shocked me for a second.This was more attention than I expected.But the more eyes I had on me, the more I could get out of it.I pushed down any emotion that I felt and started speaking monotonously.\u201cWhat do you say?\u201dThe challenger nodded his head without hesitation and\u2026\u201cOkay. To explain this power\u2026\u201dMy eyes widened as I heard his explanation.I realized I had won a pretty good power as soon as I had walked into the public area.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Go ahead.\u201dThe man walked up to the corpses after my approval and muttered something to himself.\u201cGluttony.\u201dThe corpses disappeared into dust and the male challenger's hand glowed softly.'Is it a power?'Probably something to do with his administrator 'Glutton.'\u201cNow no one will know something happened here.\u201dI didn't think it would have been a problem even if people did find out, but I guess it's one less problem to think about.\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cAh, I forgot to even introduce myself.\u201d\u201cI'm an rank hunter, Lee Sungjin.\u201d\u201cAh, okay.\u201dI thought we'd be off on our merry ways but he introduced himself out of nowhere.I was considering telling him my name but I decided against it.\u201cWell, I'm off to the public area now so\u2026 it was nice to meet you.\u201dI started to back out of the conversation.But\u2026\u201cW-wait\u2026!\u201d\u201cI can show you around the area since we're both going there.\u201d\u201cIsn't it everyone's first time in the public area right now?\u201d\u201cYeah, but I used a bunch of my questions so I know a couple of extra things.\u201d\u201cJust a few minutes is fine. I'm sure it'll be useful.\u201d'Should I?'I mean, there's nothing to lose\u2026But I didn't really want to accompany a total stranger that I'd just met.I was about to decline politely when\u2026\u201cand, I'll tell you about the other worlds as well.\u201d\u300c Administrator 'Glutton' is shocked at his contractor's generosity. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' starts to smile. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' tilts his head. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Black Devil' laughs at the challenger's decision. \u300dAfter seeing the flurry of messages, I quickly adjusted my reply.\u201cSure. I'll accompany you.\u201dNothing to lose right?Lee Sungjin talked the entire time we walked over to the public area.\u201cThe public area is centered around a huge plaza. The areas are largely divided up to be the arena, the auction house, and the casino.\u201dOf course, there were a bunch of other buildings and facilities that we had access to but\u2026Those three were the only places to go if you actually wanted to do something.I suppose I could rest in the public area if I was too cheap to buy a return stone but\u2026I didn't really want to do that.There were things I wanted to ask Lee Hayeon about anyway.\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' regrets not having formed a contract with you. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' tells him to stay away from her contractor. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Glutton' slips the two administrators a look. \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u300c Administrator 'Black Devil' is enjoying this love triangle. \u300dMaybe it was also because I was tired of seeing all these messages non-stop.'And the administrators must really want something from challengers from the looks of it\u2026'Powerful ones at that.But I didn't have the mental capacity to think about that and listen to Lee Sungjin's explanation at the same time.\u201cThe arena is where challengers can battle with one another. The victor takes whatever the loser put on the table, whether it be an item or a skill. And the loser loses whatever they bet on the battle.\u201dBesides that, the arena would only match you with someone who bet something of equal value\u2026And dying in the arena just meant that you'd be revived with a couple of penalties.\u201cMost of the challengers there would be from the 'strategy' divergence. People who chose that divergence are the ones who go against other challengers the most often. And that also means there are some nasty people there.\u201dAnd then the explanation of the auction house.\u201cAs the name implies, it's a place to auction something off. You can buy and sell items and all transactions are made through points. Everything you get through the tower is pretty high quality, so you can consider it to be at the same level as the VIP hunter market.\u201dAfter that\u2026\u201cLastly, there's the casino\u2026 but I heard it was a vulgar place. You can exchange all kinds of skills, points, or whatever into 'coins' and gamble with them. I heard you get not only points but also the ability to strengthen skills and items.\u201dThat seemed to be all.\u201cI have heard that the casino isn't a good choice for most people. According to my administrator, you can end up losing everything.\u201dMost of these things were common sense but it was still nice to know.'I guess I won't have to waste any time researching this place.'I was wondering what I was going to do here\u2026Since the explanation about the public area was done, he moved on to an explanation about the other worlds.\u201cSo you can separate otherworldly challengers into three broad categories.\u201d\u201cFrom what I know, the three worlds intruders will come from are 'Ares,' 'Murim,' and 'Kallian.' When I asked my administrator, he said that those are the only worlds we'll be intruded from.\u201d\u300c Administrator 'Glutton' nods reluctantly. \u300d'My administrator didn't say anything about that\u2026'No, maybe it was because I never asked her about it.'Maybe they're also being restricted by the tower.'\u201c\u2026Challengers from Ares are mostly knights and place a lot of importance on chivalry. They seem to be receiving their orders from a huge kingdom. Challengers from Murim are similar, but they belong to a lot of different factions and all have different beliefs.\u201dTwo challengers came to mind after hearing this explanation.'The black knight and Baek Sunhak were from Ares and Murim respectively\u2026'\u201cThere isn't much known about Kallian but\u2026 I heard those challengers are something like elves, fairies, or beastmen. Well, I haven't met one, but that's what I've heard. And apparently, they usually operate within their species.\u201dThat's also something I had no information about.'Kallian\u2026?'Beastmen seemed interesting but\u2026Everyone I'd meet would be my enemy.\u201cThe hardest to deal with are Murim challengers. They usually belong to three factions: the righteous Murim Alliance, the shrewd Dark Society, and the evil Heavenly Demon Cult.\u201dThe Murim Alliance.'Baek Sunhak said that he was an elder there.'\u201cHave you ever met anyone from Murim?\u201d\u201cNo, the only one I've met was someone from Ares.\u201dI wanted to ask some follow-up questions but\u2026\u300c You've entered the public area. \u300d\u300c All injuries and status ailments are healed and fights between challengers are forbidden.\u300dI was interrupted by a message and\u2026\u201cAh, we're finally here.\u201dI could see a bunch of people walking around the plaza behind the large gate.People from all over the world, walking somewhere with a purpose.Some of them were even talking to each other with a smile on their face.Was the fight with those Chinese challengers even real?I felt out of place that no one was fighting with bloodshot eyes.'I mean, I guess these challengers are all modern people\u2026'I just couldn't tell because I've been meeting scumbags.\u201c\u2026I think my role as a guide ends here. How was it?\u201dI turned to face him.\u201cIt was quite nice. I think it'll be helpful.\u201d\u201cHaha, I'm glad you liked it.\u201dLee Sungjin dug through his pockets with a smile and\u2026\u201cIt ain't much, but here's my business card.\u201dI took a glance at it and\u2026\u201cYou're the Challenger Management team lead at the Hunter Association.\u201d\u201cHaha, yeah, it's embarrassing, but that's my position right now.\u201d\u201cSorry if you're trying to recruit me but\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, no. It's not like that.\u201d\u201cOur team just collects information on events that happen within the tower.\u201d\u201cAh, okay.\u201d\u201cFeel free to contact me if you ever have questions.\u201d\u201cOkay. But it's not free, right?\u201d\u201cMoney might be fine but\u2026 Ideally, it would be stories about the tower.\u201d\u201cIs that why you were looking into the other worlds?\u201d\u201cWell, I guess so. I have to report it up to the association.\u201d\u201cI'll come to you if I ever need something.\u201d\u201cThank you for even considering it.\u201dHe smiled and continued to speak.\u201cWell, I'm planning on heading to the auction house from here\u2026\u201d\u201cAh, yeah. I also have a place I want to check out.\u201d\u201cThat's great. Where are you headed now?\u201dI satisfied his curiosity with an honest answer.\u201cThe arena.\u201dI'm going to bleed them dry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Stop fucking losing!\u201dAll the fiery passions of an illegal horse racing arena.People from all over the world came together to curse out their fates while staring at a scoreboard.'This is the arena\u2026?'You couldn't even see the fight itself.Everyone sat in their seats and just furiously tapped on their screens.But\u2026'I don't think I accidentally came to the casino\u2026'\u300c Welcome to the arena. \u300dAt least not according to the system message.\u300c Administrator 'Black Devil' smiles nostalgically. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is disgusted at this sight. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' is exhilarated by all the excitement. \u300dEven the administrators were calling this place the 'arena.''What's going on?'I took one of the empty seats to figure out what was going on.And then\u2026\u300c Activating the arena system. \u300d\u300c Click on the screen to choose 'betting' or 'battle.' \u300d\u300c For additional information, please click the 'help' button. \u300dTat!The black screen turned on and a couple of messages popped up.And I finally figured out what all the rage was about.'Betting and battle\u2026'\u300c Help \u300d\u300c 1. The arena is made up of a 'betting' and 'battle' system. \u300d\u300c 2. Upon choosing 'betting' you can bet points on other challengers' battles. \u300d\u300c 2-1. Upon placing the bet, the result of the battle determines the number of points you get back. \u300d\u300c 2-2, It is also possible to lose all the points depending on the result of the battle. \u300dI can see why they would be so enraged.But this wasn't what I came here to do.\u300c 3. Upon choosing 'battle,' you can place an item to bet and challenge other players. \u300d\u300c 3-1. The challenger's name and rank will be revealed to the challenged player, and the challenged player's name and rank will be revealed upon the acceptance of the battle. \u300d\u300c 3-2. All battles are one on one and do not start unless both players bet a 'skill', 'item', or 'power'. \u300d\u300c 3-3. If the two rewards aren't equal in value, the battle may be canceled. \u300d\u300c 3-4. Upon the start of the battle, the two challengers fight in the colosseum. The battle ends if a player surrenders and both challengers return to their seats. \u300d'High risk, high return.'I could keep fighting as long as we had something to bet.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dOf course, it's still a 1v1 so there's a limit to how much you can get but\u2026Change starts one step at a time.I clicked into 'Battle' and found someone to challenge.And\u2026\u300c Katheryn Benett \u300d\u300c Server \u2013 America \u300d\u300c Rank \u2013 6th \u300d\u300c Reward \u2013 Skill 'Gust Blade (C+)' \u300d\u300c Wins \u2013 17 \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

Why is no one challenging me anymore\u2026?\u201dShe sighed as her eyes stayed fixed on her unchanging screen.It's not like nobody was challenging her but\u2026Everyone who challenged her put up a pretty useless reward.And she didn't even count those as a challenge and rejected them immediately.'Why do they even have to show the wins\u2026''And they can also see that I've had 0 losses.'Hence, she was undefeated\u2026With the addition of her rank, there was basically no one coming in for a\u00a0 decent battle.They must already know that the 'Blaze Witch's real name was Katheryn Benett.Not to brag but she was easy enough on the eyes to grant a couple of media appearances and\u2026She even had a fan base in other countries.\u300c Administrator 'Fire Sovereign' smirks at their languor. \u300d\u201cYeah.\u201dKatheryn silently agreed with her contractor.\u201cDamn scaredy cats too scared to take a risk\u2026\u201dShe believed that you always had to take risks to gain anything.When she was a hunter she always took those risky battles and ended up becoming an rank hunter.Those who don't can't get stronger.But she couldn't stay angry for very long.'I guess it's about time I head out\u2026'She was getting bored of waiting around anyway.She had tried to challenge other people, but they always ended up refusing her after seeing her rank and win streak.And then\u2014\u300c You've received a challenge. \u300dAnd\u2026\u300c Han Sungyeun \u300d\u300c Server \u2013 Korea \u300d\u300c Rank \u2013 3 \u300d\u300c Reward \u2013 Skill 'Demon Slayer (C-)' \u300d\u300c Wins \u2013 0 \u300d\u300c Losses \u2013 0 \u300d\u201cHe just got to the arena\u2026?'Her opponent had neither any wins nor losses.'And he still picked me\u2026'Korea was one of the countries with the highest amount of her fans.There's no way he couldn't think of the 'Blaze Witch' after seeing the name Katheryn Benett\u2026But this challenger didn't seem to care.'Interesting.'He was probably the most reckless player she'd seen since she entered the tower.Even if his rank was high, it took guts to send her a challenge like that.'Han Sungyeun\u2026'She'd never heard the name before.Korea may not be her home country but she did know a decent amount of ranks\u2026But she couldn't even get close to recognizing the name.'I'll have to look them up once I go back.'She didn't know who this was, but the fact that he challenged her was extra points in her book.So Katheryn accepted his challenge and\u2026\u300c The battle has been established. \u300d\u300c Moving to the colosseum. \u300dIn a blink of an eye, she was transported into the middle of the colosseum.And\u2026She was joined by a man covered in a black robe.Katheryn flashed a smile at her challenger and started speaking.\u201cI admire your courage for choosing me for your first battle but\u2026\u201d\u300c Challenger Han Sungyeun vs Challenger Katheryn Benett \u300d\u300c Battle starting. \u300d\u201cYou should have done a bit more research.

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Boundless NecromancerChapter 66: Skill Acquisition (1)I was soon transported back from the colosseum.There was essentially no difference from before I'd left.The arena was still filled with challengers going wild over placing bets on the battles.But\u2026\u300c Skill \u2013 Gust Blade (C+) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 N/A \u300d\u300c Basic effect \u2013 Activates upon rushing forward with a sword and increases the attack speeds of 'thrusting' attacks by 3 times. \u300d\u300c Additional effect \u2013 Upon activation, there's a 30% chance that a 'thrusting' attack is imbued with the wind element and greatly increases movement speed. \u300dBut that didn't mean I had nothing to show for it.As I sat there reading the explanation for the skill I had just obtained, my face got darker and darker.I thought it was a sword-related weapons skill at first, but the explanation didn't match my expectations.\u201cIt wasn't a weapons skill\u2026?\u201dI mean, it was for purely 'thrusting' attacks.'I can't even grow it because it doesn't have a proficiency.'It was the only one actually worth fighting for but\u2026'I guess there was a reason she put it up as collateral.'And Katheryn Benett was a magician who didn't use a sword.Hence, it should have been a great skill that she wasn't very compatible with, but\u2026It wasn't quite what I had expected.But a skill of this rank had to be at least somewhat useful.'C+ is higher than what my Instant Acceleration is at now.'And I could potentially use it as a movement skill.'I guess that depends on how much my movement speed increases.'Well, at the very worst, I could use it to combine with other blade-related skills.That made me feel a little better about not getting a weapons skill.\u201c\u2026\u201dIt was then that I remembered what Katheryn had said in the colosseum.'She said she was gonna come see me later.'I didn't know what that meant but\u2026'There wasn't any malice in her voice so\u2026'I should just let it be.'I can also look her up once I get out too.'She seemed really adamant, so she must be pretty famous\u2026Lee Hayeon would probably know too.I decided to push that off to later

update to my profile.'1 win\u2026'The number was a little too low at the moment.And it wasn't yet time to leave the arena.Why would I walk away from such a great opportunity to grow?I wasn't that foolish.Katheryn Benett was definitely a strong enough opponent who was worthy of her ranking but\u2026I still would have ended up winning the battle even if I hadn't learned the Lightning Sword Ki mid-fight.And I was sure that I wouldn't lose to anyone weaker than her.So\u2026'Time to farm some skills.'\u300c The battle has been established. \u300d\u300c Moving to the colosseum. \u300d\u300c Challenger Han Sungyeun vs Challenger Owaki Yuji \u300d\u300c Battle starting. \u300dUnlike Katheryn, who was from the American server, this challenger was from Japan.'Owaki Yuji\u2026?'The shoulder armor and the long spear gave away that he was a spear user, but\u2026'He doesn't seem like a very good one.'Maybe it was because I'd just learned Demon Slayer, but I could tell that he was full of blindspots.That meant his weapons skill wasn't even a C- rank\u2026'This is what 11th is like in the Japan servers\u2026?'It was almost ridiculous.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' predicts a boring match. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' critiques his stance with the spear. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Black Devil' smiles slyly at the thought of a total massacre. \u300dThe administrators seemed to share a similar sentiment.But my opponent didn't seem to realize and put on a haughty face.\u201cI was excited to go up against the 3rd ranked Korean challenger but\u2026 my expectations might have been too high.\u201dWhen I heard that, I couldn't help but laugh.\u201c\u2026Why are you smiling?\u201d\u201cBecause it's funny.\u201d\u201cI didn't think we'd have the exact same thought.\u201dHe seemed to take offense to that comment and glared at me.\u201cYou think you can reach my level with that equipm\u2026!?\u201dThen\u2026\u300c Activating the skill 'Instant Acceleration'. \u300dKwaaaang\u2026!I activated my skill instead of letting the conversation continue and\u2026I kicked off the ground and dashed forward while thrusting my sword toward Yuji.And at the same time\u2026\u300c Activating the skill 'Gust Blade (C+)'. \u300d\u300c Skill 'Gust Blade (C+) imbues wind element into the blade. \u300dNot only did the skill activate, but the 30% chance for the extra wind effect had also activated.Fwooosh\u2026!\u201cWhat the\u2026!?\u201dWhen Yuji realized this battle could be over in a single blow, he started to move more rapidly.Come and

That's the only reason his name would be gone from the rankings.\u201d\u201cBut it doesn't make sense. Where could he have intruded to lose his life like that?\u201d\u201cConsidering how careful he is, he probably didn't intrude anyone from Murim as it could have political consequences.\u201d\u201cWe think so too. He probably went to a different world.\u201d\u201cWell I'm not sure which world he went to, but it's interesting that he ended up dying on a lower floor.\u201dThe man seemed to hesitate for a moment and started talking again.\u201cHmm\u2026 Well, I guess this isn't bad news for us. Since one of the representatives of the Flickering Lightning Clan died, we might be able to submit someone we sponsor as a replacement.\u201d\u201cProbably.\u201d\u201cBut I am a little curious.\u201d\u201cBaek Sunhak may be petty, but he rose to the ranks of a grand elder on pure skill. Even if he did lose all his power, isn't it interesting that he lost to a challenger of a lower floor?\u201d\u201cMaybe. The tower does provide dark arts-like skills to all the challengers.\u201d\u201cI guess he could have let his guard down. Well, that's probably not wrong but\u2026\u201dHe trailed off and smiled slightly.\u201cI'm curious to see who exactly killed Baek Sunhak.\u201d\u201cMeaning\u2026?\u201d\u201cSpare no resources to find the person who killed Baek Sunhak and bring him to me.\u201d\u201cYessir.\u201dThe man in the gi bowed his head to show respect.At the same time, the man felt a little sympathy for this mystery killer.Nam Goonghyuk was a true martial artist who felt joy from destroying other martial artists.This mystery challenger from another world would obviously peak his interest.He couldn't easily kill people from this world because of his position in the family and the political discourse it would create but\u2026'Challengers from another world are a different story.'The man mumbled to himself as he walked out of the office.\u201cIt's been a while since the last bloodbath.\u201dHeavenly Azure Dragon, Nam Goonghyuk.The dragon of the Namgoong family was making his way back into the tower for the first time in 5 years.The victories were non-stop after the power was up for grabs.Players saw the power and challenged me in hopes of maybe being able to win it.As a result, I ended up stacking up quite a bit of a collection to combine with.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

Pow.\u201cIts solidity isn't so bad, and to be able to release the absorbed damage is pretty good.\u201dOf course, I had no intention of using this ability at this place, so I immediately deactivated Counter Shield.It seemed that the abilities for protection were sufficient enough with this, so now it was time to combine all the skills I had collected.Skills to be combined could be classified into two broad categories.\u300c Skill \u2013 Silent Step (E-)\u00a0 \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 N/A \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 Able to move without making any noise. \u300dThe first was the ability to fundamentally silence the noise from footsteps.Silent step(E-) was quite worth strengthening through skill combination.Basically, it could be said that silencing the noise of footsteps is useful, but what's more important is that this was a 'footwork-type' skill.That was most important.\u201cThey said that there are quite a lot of useful skills that fall under the footwork category.\u201dSilent step (E-) simply silenced the sound, but other footwork-type skills also had effects such as increasing the movement speed, among other things.In other words, if you could combine well, it'd be a pretty good skill.It was inevitable that I would be interested, as there could be quite useful 'acceleration-type' skills, such as Instant Acceleration.\u300c Skill \u2013 Chaotic Onslaught (D) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 N/A \u300d\u300c Effect- Upon declaring the skill name, you can increase your attack speed by 2 times. However, if this effect is stacked with another attack speed buff, it is reduced to 1.35 times. \u300dAnd this attack speed increasing skill called 'Chaotic Onslaught' was the second.Fundamentally, there was nothing as important as attack speed since I was using swordsmanship skills.The fact that I could wield my sword more times than in a fight where I should've exchanged a single blow originally had that much merit.Moreover\u2026.'Discharging a Ki sword seems to have something to do with the attack speed, too\u2026..'Now that I could discharge the Ki sword into a slash with the Lightning Sword Ki, the attack speed had to become more important.This was because discharging a Ki sword, which could be regarded as my only ranged skill, was somewhat affected by the attack speed of the sword I wield.\u201cAnyway, both of them are pretty good as a base for new skills to learn.\u201dOf course, I couldn't raise the Proficiency of both of them, and their performance isn't that good, but\u2026\u2026I knew the way to overcome all those shortcomings.\u201cSkill Combination.\u201dIt was none other than a skill combination.The power of pioneers to raise the skill rank to a higher level by combining low-rank skills existed to be used in this kind of situation.\u300c Activating the innate power 'Skill Combination.' \u300d\u300c Listing the available skills. \u300dI immediately looked at the skill list and slowly started combining the skills I had learned.\u300c The two skills aren't identical in rank. \u300d\u300c Skill 'Silent step' will become the core of the combination.\u300dFirst, I continued combining, starting with Silent Step, which was closely related to walking.Basically, it was important to add a usable ability based on footwork that could silence the sound.I had a skill in my mind in advance for what kind of skill I should be adding to it.\u300c Skill \u2013 Escape (F-)\u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 N/A \u300d\u300c\u00a0 Effect- Footsteps are accelerated by 1.5 times when HP goes below 50%.\u00a0 \u300dIt was a skill that was surely useless, as well as it being such a bad skill.However, if these kinds of abilities were also considered a skill, I could use them effectively.\u300c Skill combination will start with 'Silent Step' as the core. \u300d\u300c Current probability for a high tier skill is 75% \u300d'Pretty decent.'I immediately proceeded with skill combination at the skill combination probability that appeared.\u300c Combination complete. \u300d\u300c New skill generated. \u300dAnd\u2026\u300c Skill \u2013 Hermit Step (E+) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 The user's presence disappears from the footsteps, and when moving in a dark place, the user becomes slightly faster.\u300dI smirked at the result of the skill combination.As expected from a footwork-type skill, an additional ability saying 'When moving in a dark place, the user becomes slightly faster' was attached to it.However\u2026\u2026\u201cI need to raise the rank a bit higher.\u201dWith this, it couldn't be used in actual fights, so I decided to raise the rank a little more.There were quite a few skills that I had acquired from the public area on the 10th floor, and it wasn't difficult to choose a useful skill among them.To the point that I didn't even have to do that much skill combination.\u300c Combination complete. \u300d\u300c New skill generated. \u300dOnce\u2014\u300c Combination complete. \u300d\u300c New skill generated. \u300dTwice\u2014\u300c Combination complete. \u300d\u300c New skill generated. \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThree times\u2014\u201cThe footwork-type skill is now complete with this.\u201dThe finished result after three skill combinations was quite pleasing.\u300c Skill \u2013 Clandestine Shadow's Step(C+) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Basic Effect \u2013 The user's presence completely disappears from their footsteps, and the way the user walks is effectively restructured. \u300d\u300c Additional Effect \u2013 Movement speed is increased by 30% when walking in dark places, and when stepping on the shadow of a creature, strength is amplified by 3. \u300dFirst of all, I liked that it increases the movement speed by 30%, but what caught my attention was the fact that the strength stat was amplified when stepping on the shadow of a living creature.'It basically means my attacking ability becomes stronger when I catch them with their back turned.'Of course, the situations in which it could be used were limited, but it was surprising that the strength could be amplified by 3.Because an increase in strength meant that attack power would become stronger.All that was left was the skill related to attack speed that could be activated based on 'Chaotic Onslaught'.I immediately activated the skill combination, and in addition to Chaotic Onslaught, I selected all the skills to be combined.\u300c Skill \u2013\u00a0 Light-emitting Sword (E+) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 N/A \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 Upon declaring the skill name, attack speed increases by 1.25x and the sword weapon shines. \u300dIt was a skill of a slightly higher rank to recklessly use for combining, but it didn't feel like a waste.Typically, I wouldn't have used it for combining if this skill's 'sword weapon shines' had any special effect\u2026'Unfortunately, it just seems like there's nothing special with the light.'It was only an ability to simply decorate the weapon, so I had no choice but to use it for skill combination in the end.\u300c The two skills aren't identical in rank. \u300d\u300c Skill 'Chaotic Onslaught' will become the core of the combination.\u300dAnd\u2014\u300c Skill combination will start with 'Chaotic Onslaught' as the core. \u300d\u300c Current probability for a high tier skill is 93% \u300d\u201cOh, it looks like the compatibility of the skills is good.\u201dAfter seeing the messages that were displayed, I immediately proceeded with skill combination.\u300c Combination complete. \u300d\u300c New skill generated. \u300dSeeing those messages, I immediately checked the skill I had acquired.\u300c Skill \u2013\u00a0 Chaotic Sword-fighting Play (C+)\u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Basic Effect \u2013\u00a0 When swinging a sword, the blade glows red and attack speed increases by 2%. This effect can be stacked up to 10 times in total.\u300d\u300c Additional Effect \u2013\u00a0 When the attack speed of the sword increases until the last stack, the attack speed is additionally increased by 5%. However, if the user doesn't immediately link the attack, the gathered stacks are initialized.\u300dA type of skill that could stack like Wind's Blessing() had been generated.As I looked at the description of the skill, I soon admitted it.\u201cShould I say, as expected from Skill Combination\u2026?\u201dThe skills I had just acquired were great enough that it wasn't a waste to combine all the skills I got from the public area.Even now, the ability to frantically increase attack speed by stacking like Chaotic Sword-fighting Play was inevitably useful in many ways.'The higher the skill proficiency, the better the ability will become.'Moreover, this was true not only for this Chaotic Sword-fighting Play, but also for the Clandestine Shadow's Step I had just generated.It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that both of them had an overwhelming ability compared to their skill ranks.Of course\u2026\u201cThanks to that, I almost lost all the skills I had won from the arena, though.\u201dIt took quite a lot of skills to combine to attain such an excellent skill.Excluding the Gust Blade skill that I got from Katheryn Benett, the skills I'd acquired in the public area had been synthesized into three.Counter Shield.Chaotic Sword-fighting Play.Clandestine Shadow's Step.All of them were rare skills that exceeded C+ level, so it wasn't a waste to consume quite a lot of skills.Rather, it was safe to say that I was lucky since I was able to make these skills with the ones I'd acquired in the public area.So I had to make a decision soon.\u201cI guess I'll have to delay going back to the real world.\u201dIt was the same when I checked Counter Shield by myself, but after combining all the remaining skills, I think that I'll definitely be able to clear the 11th floor.It wasn't a groundless idea.I acquired a whopping two C+ rank skills, and even Counter Shield had a higher skill level than the Ashen Blood skill I'd previously acquired.In other words, I didn't think it'd be difficult to go to the 11th floor, as not only had my abilities increased that much, but all of them were also of a high level.In the end, after giving it some time to think, I came to a conclusion.\u201cIt'll be fine if I get to the 11th floor as quickly as possible.\u201dI changed my mind. Instead of returning immediately, I decided to go up to the waiting room on the 11th floor and then return to the real world.Having decided like that, there was nothing to think about and prepare for.It was because I didn't think I needed to buy more items at the moment, and even if I didn't have such things, I figured that my skills were enough to cover them.\u300c Do you accept the 10th floor trial? \u300dWithout thinking about that matter more, I immediately responded to the trial on the 10th floor and stepped into the portal that appeared in front of me without hesitation.And\u2014\u300c Entering Tower of Trials 10th floor. \u300d\u300c Difficulty \u2013 Hard \u300d\u300c The objective of the following trial is 'cooperation.' \u300d\u300c We wish the challenger a satisfactory ending to their choice. \u300d'Cooperation, huh\u2026..'Seeing the next message that appeared, I clenched the sword in my hand tightly.\u300c The 10th floor trial is starting. \u300d\u300c Remaining time \u2013 3 hours \u300d\u300c Trial success condition \u2013 Subdue the boss monster cooperatively within the remaining time. \u300d\u300c Trial fail condition \u2013 Teammate's death or end of remaining time. \u300d\u300c Trial success reward \u2013 Skill Proficiency Potion (B+) \u300d\u300c Trial fail penalty \u2013 Death \u300dAfter reading this far, I understood what the structure of the trial of the 10th floor was.\u201cIt's been so long since I did a combined trial.\u201dIt was a combined trial with other challengers.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why, Seunghoon Hyungnim, you were also climbing the tower?\u201d\u300c Evaluation Ranking 6th, Headygongdu \u300dThe third and final person to appear was a bizarrely-dressed challenger in a red suit.\u201cOh\u2026 Haha, everyone is a ranker here. Nice to meet you.\u201dPerhaps all the team members appeared since no portals appeared after that, and Evaluation Rankings also stopped listing.I looked at them and narrowed my eyes in surprise.'Team members are assigned according to the Evaluation Rankings, I see\u2026'To think that all the challengers at the top of the Korean server Evaluation Ranking appeared.As I was feeling surprised, Kim Seunghoon opened his mouth while fiddling with his black mask.\u201cI don't think there's anything to say during the 30-minute grace period.\u201dHe had a slightly arrogant attitude, but I figured at once that his words contained various meanings.Since we'd all come this far, there was probably not much we needed to know about each other, and we just needed to clear the trial properly.As expected from the first of the Evaluation Ranking, he quickly grasped the situation, and he knew how to draw the line appropriately.Wearing a black mask and holding a hammer\u2026Needless to mention about his combat power, I had an impression that he'd be on the top of the challengers of the current tower.'Well, I mean, that's probably why he can proudly present his real name even if he's the number one.'Just then.\u201cUh\u2026 I also agree with Seunghoon Hyungnim. I don't think there's much to talk about.\u201dBelatedly, with Kim Seunghoon's words, Oh Choonsuk also agreed and lightly stepped back.'He doesn't really look like second place in the Evaluation Ranking.'Should I say he looks slightly more naive contrary to his looks?Not befitting the Evaluation Rankings, he seemed to be unable to assert himself at all, and he had a somewhat more timid impression.Occasionally, I saw them fussing about the only ranker who was originally an ordinary citizen in the messages, and I thought that might be the case.And\u2026\u201cWell, since you guys are all rankers, you can probably act on your own. I have no objections.\u201dFinally, the challenger who uses the nickname Headygongdu also meekly accepted the word.'Surprisingly, there are a lot of people with common sense. Maybe it's because of the high Evaluation Ranking.'I thought that there might be some people who'd like to go on a rampage like in the 6th floor or in the public area\u2026But it was a pretty good situation for me because no one seemed to have their personality worn out to that extent, and they only had one goal in their mind, which was to clear the trial together.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' tilts her head at the surprisingly easy-going situation. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' pouts at the unnecessary peace. \u300dOf course, the two administrators who immediately started observing me as soon as I entered the Trial didn't seem to like it.\u201cI agr\u2026\u201dIt was then, when I was about to agree with his statement while feeling a sense of relief\u2014\u201cBy the way\u2026 Apart from not having any objections, I have something I want to ask you all.\u201dAll of a sudden, HeadyGongdu cut me off and started talking about something else.\u201cDon't tell me, you guys will all stay still just because the theme of the trial is [Cooperation]?\u201dIt was Kim Seunghoon with a black mask, who was the first to respond to those words.\u201c\u2026What do you mean by that?\u201dHeadyGongdu smiled and continued talking, as Seunghoon was looking at him as though he was asking for further explanation.\u201cI'm meaning it literally. The theme of the Trial is definitely [Cooperation]. All we have to do is team up along with the challengers and defeat the boss monster\u2026 Yes, it's a theme that's not a competition. But does that mean that the next trial will be the same?\u201dWith those words, Oh Choonseok rubbed his chin and then answered while shaking his head.\u201cMm\u2026 Probably not. Since the theme of each trial changes in the Tower of Trials.\u201d\u201cExactly. Did you see the message that just appeared?\u201d\u201cIt mentioned that the team members are assigned according to the Evaluation Rankings. This means that from now on, the level of the combined trial will change according to the Evaluation Ranking. Don't you get it? This means that everyone is also a potential competitor.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cWhat are you\u2026\u201dAt the same time, as Oh Choonseok frowned, Headygongdu said as though assuring him.\u201cAh, of course, that probably doesn't apply to you, Oh Choonseok-ssi. As well as Kim Seunghoon-ssi. You two seem to be friendly with each other, making it even more so. There's no need for you guys to fight, as you'll cooperate to some extent in other trials too. But however\u2014\u201dHeadyGongdu said so, and then continued with a fishy smile.And\u2026\u201cWouldn't it be a little different for 'Hunter', 3rd place in the Evaluation Ranking?\u201dAfter he finished speaking, I had no choice but to stiffen my face.For Kim Seungjun, deceiving others was a daily thing.To provoke a fight with others with the fact that's not deceiving was the best way for him to survive.His way of life didn't change from when he was young until he worked as a C-Rank hunter.He falsely divided the team so that someone couldn't receive the reward that was supposed to be shared for him to get a bigger share.When he found a way to join a good guild, he drove his fellow teammates to another place and even went in by himself.Don't they say that by nature, humans are more prone to being deceived by the lies they hear from others than the truth in front of them?Others' fighting had always benefited him.And it could also be used in a foreign place called the Tower of Trials.After starting to use the nickname HeadyGongdu, he prevented information from being shared by encouraging quarrels between challengers as much as possible through the community function.Thanks to this, Kim Seungjun took advantage of the lack of interaction between challengers for a long time and benefited greatly from the combined trials and personal trials.And it was the same in the combined trial on the 10th floor.\u300c Administrator 'Deceitful Clown' smiles with his lips torn off at the contractor's deception.\u300dHeadyGong, no, Kim Seungjun enjoyed the atmosphere that turned cold and laughed inwardly.'I can't stop doing this because of this.'The pleasure rushed in to see the hardened face of everyone as though they had never thought of it.\u300c Administrator 'Master of duel' frowns at your speaking skills. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Seeker of Deception' Looks at your deceitful act with pleasure. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'The one gazes at darkness' Comments on your actions as a unique survival technique. \u300dEven the administrators who had been watching began to have an interest in him.Of course, there was one administrator who didn't really like him, but\u2026In any case, seeing the 'Deceitful Clown', the administrator that Kim Seungjun signed a contract with, was having fun, so it wasn't a bad reaction.'Maybe I can get a new power if I make the situation a little more interesting?'Thinking those made him excited and even made Kim Seungjun's mouth lighter at once.He glanced at the messages floating in the air, then turned his head to look at 'Hunter Han Sungyeun' on the other side.'Looking at his face stiffened up, he must be bewildered.'King Seungjun knew him well as he recently acquired his skills through all kinds of duels while revealing his name in the public area.He was a person who took out powers in the public area and acquired numerous skills through all kinds of duels using it as bait.He felt more hostile towards him because he had seen the scene in real-time in the public area as well as in the chat room.'This bastard will become insanely strong if I let him be any longer\u2026'If he climbed the tower a little more, Han Sungyeun could become stronger and later come up as a threat to Kim Seungjun in the combined trials.Therefore, Kim Seungjun thought that he needed to get rid of Han Sungyeun as soon as possible in this 10th floor combined Trial.Of course, if he was alone, it would've been different rather than provoking a quarrel with Han Sungyeun, but\u2026\u201cThe 'Hunter', who always hid himself without even chatting, is quite famous these days. Not only did he gain skills by betting his power in the arena, but he was always part of the rankings in the trial evaluations, so I always observed him with interest.\u201dCurrently, in this combined trial, in addition to 'Kim Seunghoon', the first place in the Evaluation ranking, 'Oh Choonseok', the second place was also here.Which meant?That Kim Seungjun could kill Han Sungyeun depending on how he played the game.\u201cYou must've acquired quite a number of skills already\u2026 I don't know about the cooperative-themed trials, but what about other trials? Can you guarantee that you won't be a threat to Seunghoon, or Choonseok? No, right?\u201dKim Seungjun used exaggerated gestures as much as possible, acting as though they had to get rid of him immediately.However\u2026\u201cSo you were the one who was acting up on the 4th floor combined trial.\u201dKim Seunghoon, who was quietly listening to him, said that as if he was dumbfounded.\u201cWas it Kim Seungjun or something, who said that competition was essential for the 4th floor combined trial?\u201d\u201cIf you like moving your mouth that much, I recommend you do it in front of a mirror.\u201d\u201cHaha, how could you put it like\u2026\u201d\u201cIt doesn't matter whether you kill the other challengers or not, but you'd better not involve me in it.\u201dWhen Kim Seunghoon finished his words to that point, Oh Choonseok said as though adding to it.\u201cUh, mm\u2026 I agree with Seunghoon Hyungnim's idea. I don't really want to fight that much.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about? If we can get rid of the hunter here then\u2026!\u201d\u201cBut in the end, I don't think that has anything to do with me.\u201d\u201c\u2026What? What do you mean?\u201d\u201cUltimately, I think you just don't have to climb the tower if you're not even sure of that.\u201dKim Seungjun then felt that something was going wrong and started to drip cold sweat.\u300c Administrator 'Deceitful Clown' clicks his tongue at the contractor's clumsiness.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Master of Duel' laughs at your speaking skills. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Seeker of Deception' Enjoys the result of your deceitful act with pleasure. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'The one gazes at darkness' scoffs at the result of your unique survival technique. \u300d'Fuck\u2026 I think I'm kinda fucked.'But he somehow kept his composure and continued his words.\u201cI have a special skill. I'm sure we can kill him easily. When we kill him, I'll give up all the remaining equipment. How does that sound?

I can explain it through conversa\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, No. How could you explain it through conversation at this moment.\u201d\u201cDidn't you blabber it that way since you had enough strength to handle what you've said?\u201dBut how could you talk like a bitch there, saying things like explaining it through conversation?When I added those words, I could see Kim Seungjun's eyes shaking rapidly.It was understandable.Most of the challengers' combat abilities got stronger in proportion to their Evaluation Rankings.But Kim Seungjun's Evaluation ranking was 6th, and I was in 3rd place, which was higher than that, so\u2026It was easy to predict that the pressure Kim Seungjun felt right now would be severe because of the two challengers who had declared that they wouldn't interfere.However, just like a bug that acts desperately when they're cornered, Kim Seungjun was no different.He looked at me slowly approaching him and opened his mouth as though frightened and began to speak.\u201cP-Please wait a minute\u2026! Calm down and think about it! It'll be a loss for both of us if we fight against each other!\u201d\u201cAre you really sure that the two behind us won't attack!?\u201d\u201cEven if I look like this, I'm also 6th place in the Evaluation ranking. I won't just stay still if I'm attacked, which will damage you, Han Sungyeun-nim.\u201d\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cWhat I'm saying is that If they take the advantage and break in to kill both of us, there's no other ending that's worse than that.\u201dAt those words, Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonseok frowned as though they were dumbfounded, but\u2026Kim Seungjun glanced at them and continued his words with a sullen smile as though he didn't care at all.\u201cEven if we fight and waste our strength, we'll have to endure the trial of the 10th floor, so there would be nothing good for you, Hang Sungyeun-nim. There's a chance that those two might attack you. Even if that's not the case, the trial of the 10th floor might be harder than you think, and you could be fatally injured from the wounds accumulated on your bo\u2026\u201dIt was just all disgusting words to hear.\u201cI don't know why you're talking about this bullshit for so long.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d\u201cIn the end, I think you're speaking under the assumption that I'll receive a lot of damage\u2026\u2026 But that's ridiculous.\u201d\u201cTo take a lot of damage from a guy who's just all talk, and to get marked by other challengers because of that.\u201dIt was a story that would make even a passing dog laugh.When I sarcastically said so, Kim Seungjun took a fighting stance as if he got the idea of what was going to happen.A book that spread purple energy suddenly appeared in the empty air.He took an item out from the inventory in preparation for a fight.Flutter!The book held in Kim Seungjun's right hand opened by itself and began to spread out intense energy.He started shouting only then, wiping out all the manners he had while making a bloody smile.\u201cYou fucking bastard\u2026 It looks like you don't understand because I'm saying it nicely, but it's not just you who's known for something, but I'm also\u2026!?\u201dHowever, Kim Seungjun's words couldn't be continued further and had to be cut off, as if he was in shock.\u300c Activating the skill 'Instant Acceleration.' \u300dThis was because I activated the Instant acceleration that ranked up in the duel with Katheryn Benett and began to seriously rush toward him.Of course\u2026\u300c The wind of the swamp spirit wraps around the user's feet.\u300d\u300c Temporarily sealing the acceleration that uses mana.\u300dAs Kim Seungjun didn't just climb the tower for nothing\u2014 he sealed off my feet, which he judged as a threat.But even if he did, I had already prepared for such weakening abilities a long time ago.\u300cActivating the skill 'Mana Resistance'.\u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u300cThe wind of the swamp spirit completely disappears.\u300dWithout even having to use a skill such as Forceful Breakthrough, I immediately regained my speed by the Mana Resistance only.\u201cNo way, what kind of insane Mana resistance is th\u2026!\u201dAt the same time, while Kim Seungjun was spitting out his complaint, I was able to reach right in front of him and\u2014Crunch.The moment I arrived in front of him, I kicked Kim Seungjun's stomach without hesitation.The reason why I didn't use my sword right away was to see the hidden card that Kim Seungjun was hiding.Just in case, since there would be nothing more complicated than getting attacked during that gap after him blocking my sword.Slam\u2026!A loud sound echoed from the place where my feet were stuck, and Kim Seungjun's body flew backward, but\u2026\u201cK-Kuhughh\u2026!\u201dSeemingly, he looked slightly shocked, but it didn't seem like he had received that much damage in reality.Kim Seungjun, who flew backward, groaned and glared at me without falling to the floor.Well, since Kim Seungjun was drooling a little bit, it didn't feel like a threat even if I received those glares.I had a sensation on my feet, clearly piercing through and destroying something, but seeing that he was in good shape, he seemed to have done something.'I wondered why he was wearing a red suit, but I guess it was an item after all.\u201dIt was within my expectation, so I wasn't bewildered.It looked like a protection-type of an item, but it didn't seem to alleviate the direct impact.Judging from the fact that I felt I was blocked while piercing through something when I attacked, it seems like an item that absorbs the shock by creating a shield when attacked\u2026'If I used the sword right away, it might have been blocked by the shield for a while.'Even better, since I attacked briefly and backed off, I could see what kind of hand the opponent was holding.Regardless of the opponent being weaker than me, since he was a challenger who was on the top leaderboard of the Evaluation Ranking, it was important to figure out Kim Seungjun's ability.However\u2026Naturally, I didn't hesitate any longer after realizing that he didn't have a lot of skills to protect himself.I didn't pull my kick just now, but I did it with an intention to at least break his ribs.Getting your bones fractured in a battle is like death, so all means of defense must've been used by him.That being said, the protection-type ability that was used to block the attack he just used must be the only means of Kim Seungjun protecting himself.'If this is all of your defense, then I can't lose even if I wanted to.'At that, I immediately activated the skill with a deeper smile.\u300c Activating the skill 'Wind's Blessing.' \u300d\u300c All speeds increased by 40%. \u300d\u300c Number of stacks \u2013 4/7 \u300dWhoosh\u2026!The Wind's Blessing that was activated instantly accelerated my feet a little more, and my body moved like a breeze.The reason why I didn't go all out was to prepare for the second battle if it occurred later on, as Kim Seungjun said, as there were two challengers watching me from behind.I could prepare for an emergency by making them think that this speed was the best I could pull off right now.However, Kim Seungjun, who was in front of me, immediately unfolded all of his powers as though he didn't even care about that matter anymore after getting struck once.\u201cFucckkkkkkkk\u2026! Die, you son of a bitch\u2026!\u201dThe moment when he clearly revealed his malice and held out his left hand while holding a book in his right hand while drooling.A chain of a lightning bolt from Kim Seungjun's left arm began to rush in at a violent speed as though wrapping around his front.Bzzzzzzzzzzzzzt\u2026\u2026..!!'He was saying stuff like if I'll be alright after fighting each other, but I guess he deserved to say that.'As I watched the blue chains rushing in as if they were swallowing up the space, the words Kim Seungjun said didn't seem to be a complete bluff.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' advises not to touch the chain of the lightning bolt. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Gluttony' Spectates your battle with interest. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' expects you to show off your swordsmanship. \u300dThe administrators who watched also threw messages to me as they knew that.But even seeing such a lightning bolt, I didn't feel that much sense of danger.That was because\u2026\u300c Activating the skill 'Counter Shield'. \u300dI prepared for this kind of situation in the waiting room in advance.Whurr!As I extended out my left arm and activated the skill, a large shield with a reddish glow spread over the palm of my hand.And\u2026\u2026.Claaaaaaaaaaaang!The chain of lightning bolt released by Kim Seungjun loudly crashed into the shield and dispersed, and in the meantime, I felt the lightning partially being absorbed by the shield.Of course, since it was pretty powerful, it consumed quite a lot of mana to increase the toughness of the shield, but that much shock was stacked up on the shield.Counter Shield was a skill that absorbed a certain amount of damage received and then reflected the accumulated amount of damage the other way round.In other words, this shield that blocked the skill that Kim Seungjun had just fired with all his might had some part of Kim Seungjun's power.\u201cWh-What is this\u2026 You blocked this skill that easily\u2026!?It was clear what to do now.I made the size of the shield small enough to fit my hand's palm, looked at Kim Seungjun in shock, and smiled.\u201cI'll give you back just the amount I have received, so try your best to block it.\u201dAnd at the same time\u2014\u300cThe skill 'Counter Shield' releases the accumulated damage at once. \u300dBaaaaaaaaaaaaaaam\u2014!A lightning bolt flashed from the small shield floating in the palm of my hand, and a circular beam of light poured out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Therefore he reigned as a transcendent existence.He never showed himself, but whenever a gate suddenly appeared like a disaster, the Lightning king always destroyed the gate, revealing his god-like power.And after clearing the gates easier and faster than anyone else, he always reproached the hunters, who were busy running away.'I didn't know how scums who couldn't even settle these things could call themselves hunters.'It may sound arrogant at first, but even though the forcibly conscripted hunters ran away for various reasons, he alone fulfilled his responsibilities.He was entitled to say that because he was that kind of person and not anyone else.Moreover, no hunter could refute the Lightning king.But that was no surprise.This was because it was difficult to find a strong hunter at the level of the Lightning king in the current hunter industry.The Hunter Association even said this if you asked how much it was\u2014'In the future, a hunter of the Lightning King's level won't appear easily in the hunter industry.'He released and poured out lightning on rampaging monsters out of control\u2026After that, the sight of him scolding hunters who only coveted their rights while abandoning the duties they should've always done made the Lightning King into an S-rank hunter.However\u2026Ever since the Tower of Trials appeared, the activity of the Lightning King, who had always handled all kinds of gates, had ceased.It was because he was also helplessly dragged into the Tower of Trials just like everyone else.What was worse was the difficulty he was dragged into wasn't easy or normal, but Hard, which was known for being the worst.Nevertheless, the Lightning King grew stronger and faster.The more he broke through all the trials, the more he began to regain the ability he had before, and in the end, he was ranked Number 1 in the Evaluation Rankings.The Tower's trial may have troubled him, but it didn't kill him.It was also the same for combined trials.For the Lightning King, and Kim Seunghoon, who was currently playing an active role as a top challenger in the Tower of Trial, most of the other challengers were like a backdrop.Only Oh Choonseok, a talented challenger who was said to be an ordinary person, was recognized as a challenger-like challenger for him, though\u2026Other than him, he felt that they were no different from the Hunters who had given up their responsibilities from the outside.Until he saw Han Sungyeun in the trial on the 10th floor of the Tower of Trials.\u201cK-Kuhuuuugh\u2026\u201dSeeing Kim Seungjun, who had just been playing politics, spilling blood like water, Kim Seunghoon was filled with pure admiration.\u201cThis is different from what I expected\u2026\u201dOriginally, Kim Seunghoon thought that Han Sungyeun would get quite a few injuries, too, when the fight between Kim Seungjun and Han Sungyeun was about to break out.Or, it would be a fight that had to waste a lot of time or put out quite a bit of the skill they both had.However\u2026'He overwhelmed Kim Seungjun in just a few minutes, huh.'Kim Seunghoon's expectations based on the Evaluation rankings were immediately shattered.It was because Han Sungyeun suppressed Kim Seungjun immediately without showing all his skills, even though he expected him to spend quite a bit of time to achieve victory.It wasn't even a kill. He suppressed him.He completely suppressed him by returning some of the damage accumulated by Kim Seungjun's attack.Han Sungyeun was quite relaxed even though he showed more strength than Kim Seunghoon had expected.In other words, Han Sungyeun didn't go all out.Oh Choonseok, who was standing next to where Kim Seunghoon was sitting and watching the fight, also asked a question as though he was dumbfounded.\u201cSeunghoon Hyung-nim. Do you know Hunter\u2014 no, who that challenger named Han Sungyeun is?\u201d\u201c\u2026I don't know. I had never seen such a person among the high-ranking hunters before.\u201dKim Seunghoon, who had a reputation for being the Lightning king, had never seen such a strong person before.It was the same for Oh Choonseok, who was originally an ordinary person.\u201cI mean, what kind of\u2026 crazy skill does he have? He blocked magic with a shield made of mana instantly and even absorbed some of the blocked damage, accumulated it, and released it as is. On top of that, he's not a mage but a melee swordsman.\u201cIt's even scarier that he didn't fight with all his might.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes, that wasn't all of his power. He was just toying around.\u201d\u201cHe's good at fighting, I've never seen his face before, and his skill set is odd. Skills that aren't originally obtained from the tower can only be obtained if you have the aptitude. But all his aptitudes are lacking in unity. Shield skill is close to the mage, but swordsmanship and movement skills are close to melee combat classes.\u201dBefore the Tower of Trials appeared, [Skills] weren't easily obtainable.Innate talent had control over everything, and depending on whether or not you had an aptitude, it determined your possibility of acquiring it.It wasn't just that.Even if you had an aptitude for combat skills, the process of effort would vary depending on how much of that attitude you had.Some people could only acquire the skill by repeating the same skill acquisition method by doing it hundreds of times, but others could acquire it in less than ten times.The world of hunters was completely driven by talent.That was until this Tower of Trials, which allows you to acquire skills, appeared.Then that means\u2026\u201cThen it means that an ordinary person who was hitting rock bottom like me developed in the tower and became that strong.\u201dIt meant that he was just an ordinary person like Oh Choonseok but became insanely strong through the rewards of the tower.Moreover, when watching him fight, he had developed to the point where he was no different from Kim Seunghoon.At that fact, Kim Seunghoon looked at Han Sungyeun and smiled softly.'An ordinary person who developed to a level similar to that of a top-ranked hunter, you say\u2026'Kim Seunghoon's smile was full of surprise, as well as interest.This was the second time that one of Korea's top hunters, Lightning King, had had an interest in others.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013 DVN-L ]\u201cKu-Kuhuuugh\u2026\u201dSeeing Kim Seungjun crawling on the floor like a bug, I slightly frowned.It was because I realized that the damage of the lightning bolt released by the Counter Shield was stronger than I expected.I reduced the size of the shield in a moment and concentrated the energy on a small area to maximize the attack efficiency, but\u2026Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'I was just going to inflict moderate damage and restrain his movement for a while\u2026'Be that as it may, I never imagined that I'd be able to take him down him this easily at once.It was a pretty surprising result, perhaps because it was an attack done by Kim Seungjun with a do-or-die attitude.'Well, anyway, it looks like he's gonna die soon looking at him crawling on the ground.'Kim Seungjun was dragging himself with a hole in his stomach, somehow trying to get away from me.Some people may feel bad at the sight of Kim Seungjun's spiteful will to survive, but\u2026There was no other sight as refreshing as this for me, who was almost put in a situation on the verge of death just now due to Kim Seungjun playing politics.And that was the same for the administrators who were watching me.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is inflated with pride at her contractor's great performance. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Gluttony' is astonished by looking at your overwhelming battle. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' enjoyed your performance but feels a little sullen for not using the Ki sword. . \u300dThe Iron-blooded Monarch was even acting conceited, as though she accepted my victory as her own situation.Meanwhile, the White Cran Sword Saint was getting sullen because I didn't use the Ki sword, the power he supported.Well, actually, I was going to use the Ki sword as well, but Kim Seungjun had lost even before that, so I didn't have much to say.If I had known that Kim Seungjun would be this easily defeated, I'd have cut off his head by using Ki sword directly, without having to test the water.It was then\u2014\u201cI-Inventory\u2026\u2026.\u201dKim Seungjun, who was crawling on the floor, suddenly opened his inventory and took out a potion from it.Looks like he took out a healing potion to heal his hole in the stomach, but\u2026'There's no way I'm allowing you to do that.'As soon as I saw it, I quickly moved and trampled on Kim Seungjun's hand, which was holding the potion.Smash!\u201cKu-Kuaaaaaaaagh!\u201d\u201cIt'd be better for you to stop struggling, you know.\u201d\u201cP-Please\u2026 L-Let me use the potion\u2026\u201dAs though he was driven to the point of death, Kim Seungjun flailed around his arms in the air and made a sound close to begging.It was hard to believe that he was the one who had just tried to kill me by playing politics.But I couldn't feel any kind of pity looking at that sight.It was obvious.\u201cYou probably thought everything's gonna be alright if you beg after trying to kill someone, but\u2026\u201dI wasn't a saint, but I wasn't an absolute villain either.My will was clear, as much as I had a mindset close to an ordinary person.\u201cDon't you think it's a little bit too late to survive?\u201dFighting fire with fire.The right response to someone who tried to control others with power was to control them with power.\u201cChallenger Kim Seunghoon-nim, and Oh Choonseok-nim.\u201dI spoke to the two challengers with a cold smile, looking at this situation.\u201cI want you two to cooperate to not help challenger Kim Seungjun, even if something that's not nice to see happens. Would that be okay?\u201dAt those words, Kim Seunghoon quietly nodded his head as though he wouldn't interfere.\u201c\u2026You don't even have to mention it. After all, he's a scum who tried to survive by using his silver tongue. Do as you wish.\u201dAfter that, it was a little bit later, but Oh Choonseok nodded his head in the same way and told me to do as I wished.\u201cY-Yeah, please help yourself. Whatever the outcome was, I was going to kill him anyway.\u201dIn the end, they agreed more willingly than I thought. Perhaps both of them were trying to get rid of Kim Seungjun eventually.Normally, if it was the usual challengers I'd seen in the Tower of Trials, they would've been making a fuss about taking some of the items Kim Seungjun was equipping, but\u2026'Since they're top-ranking challengers, they aren't doing such filthy things.'Rather, it looked like they would've helped me if I had been cornered.Of course, it was because Kim Seungjun was such a vicious challenger, so I was able to receive their consent easily.Now that I have received their consent, there was nothing to hesitate for.Craaacck\u2026!\u201cK-kuhuughk! My hand! My hand is broken\u2026!\u201dI immediately smashed Kim Seungjun's hand bones, picked up his potion that fell to the ground, and read the description window.\u300cRapid Regeneration Potion\u300d\u300cRank : C \u300d\u300cA regeneration potion made with special alchemy by grinding a troll's magic stone.\u300d\u300cWhen the potion is consumed, the [Troll's blood] temporarily flows through the body, and the body regenerates at a rapid speed.\u300d\u300cHowever, the concentration at which [Troll's blood] is activated varies depending on the amount of potion the user takes. \u300d\u201cYou were trying to use a quite good potion there, huh.\u201dAfter reading the phrase that the concentration of [Troll's blood] activated varies depending on the amount of potion the user takes, I immediately pulled out the top of the potion and spilled some of it on Kim Seungjun.Fizzle.Kim Seungjun, who was on the verge of death as he was slowly stopping to move, twitched and started to move again as I dropped a few drops of potion on his pierced stomach.\u201cW-Why\u2026\u201dKim Seungjun muttered to himself as though he couldn't understand it, but I didn't do this because I felt bad for Kim Seungjun or wanted to take him as a team member.\u201cKim Seungjun-ssi, I have an offer for you.\u201dThe reason why I used a little bit of potion on that bastard was because\u2026\u201cEven now, if you take out all the items in your inventory and hand them over, I'll use this potion to save you.\u201dJust like how he offered Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonseok to kill me and share my items afterward.I was also paying him back in the same way.Of course, in fact, this was just an option that only delayed Kim Seungjun's death.Even though he probably knew that I wouldn't have to keep this promise\u2026\u2026Kim Seungjun had only one option to choose from.\u201cPlease decide.\u201dKim Seungjun, who was nothing but a loser, wasn't given a choice from the beginning.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I gave you everything that I got\u2026!!\u201d\u300c Activating the skill ' Eye of Truth.' \u300dEverything that this person says is true.He seemed to be hiding no items at all.Only then did I remove my feet that were on Kim Seungjun's body and put the acquired items into the inventory.Of course, I didn't store the [Necklace of Thunder God worshiper] in the inventory and wore it right away.\u300cCurrently, Player Han Sungyeun doesn't have a unique mana property.\u300d\u300cThe mana property begins to develop under the effect of the Necklace of Thunder God Worshiper (A).\u300dIt was because I thought that it wasn't so bad to get a property for someone like me who didn't have a mana property at all.When I asked Kim Seungjun, I was able to find out that he only used it once, and It still had about two uses left.\u201cPlease, stop it already\u2026 I-I'll do anything if you spare me, so\u2026\u201dIn the process, his bones were broken and regenerated several times, and Kim Seungjun turned into a gruesome sight, but\u2026I didn't feel any sense of pity or anything because of that sight.He made his bed, it was time for him to lie in it.He was just paying the price for his own evil deeds.As I looked at his not-even-pitiful figure, I soon smashed the potion in my hand.Crack!Seeing the glass shards smashed on my hands and the potion inside dripping onto the floor, Kim Seungjun's eyes widened and he gnashed his teeth.\u201cFuck\u2026!! I gave you all the items in my inventory as you wanted, but what\u2026!!\u201dKim Seungjun's face terribly distorted as he finally realized that he had been deceived, but\u2026\u201cWhy would I keep a promise\u2026 that I don't even have to keep.\u201dI answered with an unmoved voice even after hearing his cry and approached Kim Seungjun.Kim Seungjun was frightened and tried to run away from the place somehow, but he couldn't.As I didn't even use 30% of the Rapid Regeneration potion, Kim Seungjun was barely surviving.\u201cFuck, Fuck, Fuck\u2026!! Please, somebody help m\u2026!\u201dKim Seungjun somehow crawled with both arms and asked help from Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonsuk, but\u2026Crash!I immediately stomped on Kim Seungjun's head as hard as I could and cut his voice off cleanly.After a neat finale with no feelings of guilt, regrets or anything left\u2014\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the player 'Kim Seungjun'. \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 12.7% \u300dAgain, only the message of Necromancy that informed me I had absorbed the soul floated up.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013 DVN-L ]When I absorbed the soul of Kim Seungjun after he died, a new message appeared in front of me.\u300c10 minutes left until the start of the trial.\u300d\u300cAll challengers, please prepare for the upcoming trial of the 10th floor.\u300dIt was none other than the waiting time for the trial of the 10th floor ending soon.Well, it took quite a while to kill Kim Seungjun, but I gained a lot of worth from that.As I was feeling satisfied with it, Kim Senghoon and Oh Choonsuk approached me.\u201cLooks like you have completely finished him.\u201dKim Seunghoon spoke to me with a calm attitude, and I responded to it without any emotions.\u201cIt's because I don't tend to leave the source of possible troubles.\u201d\u201cIs that so\u2026 Well, that's not a bad choice either.\u201dAs Kim Seunghoon nodded while saying that out of the blue, he thrust his finger towards the air.I was nervous for a while, wondering if it was to activate some kind of skill, but\u2026\u300c Challenger Kim Seunghoon has sent you a friend request. \u300dThe tension dissipated immediately with the friend request message that arrived suddenly.\u201cYou may contact me in the future if you have any questions or concerns.\u201dBefore I could even be bewildered by his voice that seemed satisfied, Kim Seunghoon immediately turned his back and walked away from me with those words.'\u2026What was that?'While I was feeling a profound sense of wonder about what in the world was going on\u2014\u300c Challenger Oh Choonsuk has sent you a friend request. \u300dThen, the friend request of Oh Choonsuk, who was next to him, also arrived.When I looked at Oh Choonsuk, soon he opened his mouth embarrassedly.\u201cHaha\u2026 I might be a little bit shameless, but I want to contact you in the future.\u201dIt seemed that the fact that he didn't help me in the fight with Kim Seungjun made him feel quite uncomfortable.But even if I was in place of Oh Choonsuk, I wouldn't have risked helping others.And it looked like he was going to kill Kim Seungjun no matter what. Then if he really thought that I was in danger, he would've intervened.\u201cNot even close. Well, you can always contact me if you want to.\u201dThere was nothing wrong with having a means of contact with the top challengers.\u300c You've accepted the friend request from challenger Kim Seunghoon. \u300d\u300c You've accepted the friend request from challenger Oh Choonsuk. \u300dI accepted the two friend request immediately. Only then did Oh Choonsuk smile.\u201cAh, Thank you. I was wondering what I should do if you don't accept it\u2026 Thank goodness.\u201dOh Choonsuk said so, and then he glanced at me and continued.\u201cYou must've chosen the conqueror when choosing the radiance on the 8th floor.\u201dI couldn't help but widen my eyes in response.When I looked at Oh Choonsuk as though surprised, he scratched his head, embarrassed.\u201cWhen I saw you using the skill a while ago, it looked like you summoned something like a shield made out of mana\u2026. But it's unlikely that melee-type hunters would learn such a thing. It seems like a skill with a fairly high rank, but it's difficult for melee-type hunters to acquire such skills. Well, not only that, but there are other reasons as well.\u201d\u201cWhat would that other reason be\u2026\u201d\u201cRadiance\u2014 I also chose the conqueror, you see. So I was sure. Well, I couldn't combine skills with such a high rank like you did, Han Sungyeun-ssi. It looks like you acquired your skills by integrating all the useless skills you've acquired so far, but honestly, I feel envious.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201dIf he had chosen the radiance of a conqueror, Oh Choonsuk would've been able to combine skills like I did\u2026Just as I was starting to think so, Oh Choonsuk opened his mouth again as if he was going to explain it.\u201cOriginally, skills were easy to acquire when you have the aptitude you know\u2026 Each skill requires different aptitudes, and there are also aptitude levels that make it almost impossible to get one.\u201dI couldn't deny that what he was saying was true until the towers appeared.Because I couldn't also get any skills due to that damn aptitude back then.\u201cOf course, things changed a bit after the tower appeared, but the points acquired through clearing the trials weren't enough to use to get the skills that can be used for skill combination, and even skill combination seemed to have to be done with similar skills. Otherwise, it'll result in some strange skills.\u201dThat was true too.I wanted to know what would happen when different types of skills were combined, so I realized it after I combined Heat Resistance with the skill called Ranger's Knowledge.It was then that I clearly realized that combining useless skills didn't produce better results than before.\u201cBut it seems that you made a lot of gains from the skill combination, Han Sungyeun-ssi. Well, I haven't tried many things yet since I don't have many skills, so I was wondering if there's another way to use the skill combination.\u201dThen I realized just how big the difference in conqueror radiance was depending on a person.Due to my innate ability, Necromancy, I was able to absorb the stats as well as the skills.In other words, I had a perfect innate ability for using the conqueror radiance's innate power, [Skill Combination].On the other hand, Oh Choonsuk, didn't have an easy way to acquire the skills, so it was difficult to use the innate power in many ways.And because of that, he guessed that the skill I was using was obtained through the power of the radiance, and then questioned me.However\u2026'There's no such thing as a hidden function in the power of radiance.'There was no hidden function in skill combination, only a slight rule on combining the skills.Other than that, most of them were practically meaningless, so I thought about it for a while, but\u2026\u201cNo, I was just lucky to have it by combining the skills so\u2026 instead, I think I'll be able to tell you what I learned while combining the skills.\u201dSoon, I taught him the basic laws of Skill Combination while hiding my innate ability.Like how the activation method was determined when combining skills and how the core content of the skill changed.Well, actually, these were all parts you could get a sense of when you did quite a bit of combining, but even that seemed to be quite helpful for Oh Choonsuk.\u201cOh\u2026 so those kinds of things existed too huh, there were quite a few features that I didn't even know.\u201dOh Choonsuk lightly admired and tried to open his mouth as if he had more to ask, but\u2026\u300c Time over. \u300dFrom the moment he saw the message that popped up, he couldn't.\u300c The trial of the 10th floor will begin. \u300d\u300c The remaining time will begin to decrease, and monsters will appear. \u300dThe trial of the 10th floor began without even having time to talk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since this is also some kind of competition.\u201dWhether it was a special task or whatever, this was no different from a competition that had begun.Considering that all challengers in the 10th floor stage were listed in the contribution rankings, there was no room for hesitation.Perhaps Oh Choonsuk also knew it too, he scratched his hair and opened his mouth.\u201cWell, we can't really give way to each other anyway\u2026 Let's do each other's best.\u201d\u201cAs a matter of fact, I was gonna do so.\u201d\u201cIt's good that we're on the same page.\u201dHaving said that, Oh Choonsuk immediately took out an old-fashioned cone hat from his inventory, pressed it on his head, and smiled.\u201cWell then.\u201dLastly, with that short ending statement, Oh Choonsuk ran forward and started spewing flames from his fingertips at the monsters of dirt that looked like snakes.I thought he might be a mage at first glance, but as I expected, Oh Choonsuk seemed to be a challenger specializing in magic battles.Of course, since the enemy was made of dirt, I wondered if he really had to use fire magic, but\u2026Baaaang!Overshadowing those worries, the dirt snakes that touched Oh Choonsuk's fire exploded to pieces.Seeing the flames that spread wherever they passed by and indiscriminately killed monsters, it appeared to be a combat method specialized in mass killing.While I was feeling that his evaluation ranking wasn't just for a show, Kim Seunghoon who'd been standing still, began to move with his large hammer.However\u2026\u201cWhat\u2026 is that.\u201dAs soon as Kim Seunghoon's battle began, I couldn't help but be astonished.Bzzzzzzzzzt\u2026.!The moment when the lightning started to flow from Kim Seunghoon's body and scatter in all directions, it created an unusual sight.Whiish!Kim Seunghoon's figure soon started moving at such a high speed while smashing the floor that only a blurry afterimage could be seen.And at the same time\u2014Pow! Pow! Pow!The dirt snakes around Kim Seunghoon got their heads exploded just as his afterimage left on his path disappeared.Looking at this overwhelming sight, I couldn't help but shudder.So this is\u2026\u201cA top challenger.\u201dIt was the pure strength of the top challenger, the so-called ranker.I wondered if they were worse than the challengers from another world, but\u2026Watching the battle of Kim Seunghoon, and Oh Choonsuk, that thought completely disappeared.\u201cInteresting.\u201dThis kind of trial boiled my blood even more than the competition with lower-ranking challengers such as Capture the Flag.Feeling my blood boil after so long, I also moved my body while giving a tight grip on the Thunder Blade.\u300c Activating the skill 'Instant Acceleration.' \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Wind's Blessing.' \u300d\u300c All speeds increased by 40%. \u300d\u300c Number of stacks \u2013 4/7 \u300dWhooosh\u2026!In a moment, I arrived at the center where the dirt snakes gathered while cutting through the wind.With a deep smile, I moved to the place where their shadows stretched out.And\u2026\u300c Activating the skill 'Clandestine Shadow's Step.' \u300d\u300c You're stepping on the shadow of a living creature. \u300d\u300c Your strength temporarily increases by +3. \u300dI activated the newly acquired skill and quickly moved the sword in my hand.\u300c Activating the power 'Sword Ki Master.' \u300dI activated the sword ki sponsored by the White Crane Sword Saint.\u300c Activating the skill 'Lighting Sword Ki.' \u300dIn addition, I mixed in the Lightning Sword Ki I acquired by absorbing the soul of Baek Sunhak, the elder of the Murim alliance.\u300cActivating the skill ' Chaotic Sword-fighting Play.'\u300d\u300cSword attack speed increases by 2%.\u300d\u300cNumber of stacks \u2013 1/10\u300dRaising the attack speed, I immediately cut the snake's neck neatly in front of me.\u300cYou have defeated the earth snake.\u300d\u300cYou gain 1 contribution point.\u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u300cCurrently, challenger Han Sungyeun's contribution ranking is last place.\u300dA message appeared in front of me that I had earned a contribution point, but it wasn't the time to be concerned about that.Slash!I didn't stop there. I went behind the snakes trying to attack me with fleet footwork and swung my sword while activating the 'Clandestine Shadow's Step.'Smash! Slash! Pow!I twisted the corners of my mouth while repeating that series of processes several times in less than 10 seconds.This\u2026This isn't enough\u2026I couldn't be satisfied with this.'This won't do If I want to take the first place.'Faster and more efficiently\u2026I had to hunt without any breaks, like flowing water.Only then could I be first in the contribution rankings.I repeated that in my mind as though to imprint it and then smashed the floor.It was the start of an earnest hunt.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013 DVN-L ]Faster and more efficiently\u2026Seeing Han Sungyeun muttering without realizing it, the Iron-blooded Monarch smiled softly.\u201cShould I say, as expected from the contractor I chose\u2026..\u201dLike a fish in water, Han Sungyeun was smiling more as he got rid of the snakes beyond the hologram screen.As if he was really enjoying it.Looking at the scene, the Iron-blooded Monarch realized again what kind of existence Han Sungyeun was.He was one of the few top-ranked challengers in the Earth dimension, where it'd been just a few months since the Tower of Trials settled in.She understood what that meant as she had spent quite some time as an administrator.\u201cHe's a man of talent that can't be easily seen in other dimensions.\u201dThose who realized the structure of the Tower were afraid of death and eventually stopped climbing the Tower and gave up their path as a challenger.Or, even if they did climb, they climbed it only after spending endless time preparing themselves to the point where they wouldn't take any risks.That was the most standard reaction of those who had just entered the Tower of Trials.However, Han Sungyeun, seen through the eyes of the Iron-blooded Monarch, was fundamentally different from them.The desire to grow.Even though he was from a dimension where the Tower of Trial wasn't known yet, he climbed up the Tower knowing nothing, with only the desire to grow.It could be said that he was a monster that only looked forward to growth.And that was still the same even now as he went through the trial on the 10th floor.Even though he had just taken all the items of Kim Seungjun, as though that wasn't enough, he was trying to clear the special task in first place.In order to win the special reward that's given only to the one with the highest contribution points.It wasn't an exaggeration to say Han Sungyeun's image was like a ghost blade, slashing around with the Sword Ki of Lightning on his blade.The Iron-blooded Monarch looked at Han Sungyeun and thought to herself.That he's a strange challenger she hasn't seen in a long time.\u201cThis\u2026 reminds me of the old days.\u201dThere was a time when the Iron-blooded Monarch also fought in pursuit of strength like that.Those days when she overtook everyone who climbed the Tower and fought like a madman with a sword in her hand.At that time, she was literally an Iron-blooded Monarch that no one could lay their hand on.Of course, that also came to an end as she approached the end of the Tower and met her death, though\u2026She thought that Han Sungyeun might be different.'Should I say I was lucky that I'm his first contractor\u2026'If Han Sungyeun's first contract had been taken away by others, even the Iron-blooded Monarch, who had never been interested in a contract, would've been devastated.But\u2026\u201cTo think that this challenger with such insane growth potential is my contractor\u2026\u201dIn the end, the Tower transferred Han Sungyeun's contract to the Iron-blooded Monarch, and thanks to this, the Iron-blooded Monarch was able to sign a contract with Han Sungyeun.The Iron-blooded Monarch was thankful for that part.For the challenger, the [First contract] was more important than one could imagine.It's a system that unlocks starting from the waiting room of the 11th floor, and you could receive support in earnest from the contracted administrator.And one of the functions that is expanded at that time is that the contract between the additional administrators to the challenger can also be interfered with by the Iron-blooded monarch to some extent.Of course, that was only to a certain extent, and the decision was made by the challenger, so the Iron-Blooded monarch was also nervous at this point.'As a matter of fact, The White Crane Sword Saint seemed to be interested in Han Sungyeun\u2026'Even if you were the first administrator to be contracted, the importance may vary depending on the choice of the challenger.As the administrator received benefits from the Tower according to the growth level of the contracted challenger, if the manager was pushed out of the challenger's importance, the benefits obtained by nurturing the challenger decreased.Therefore, She had no choice but to worry about what happened in the waiting room on the 11th floor.To the challengers of the Murim world, the White Crane Sword Saint was almost like a legend, and even Gluttony, who was snooping around these days, had quite a lot of followers in Callian.She was the first administrator to have a contract, but compared to other administrators, it could be seen that she didn't bring a lot of advantages.At least for Han Sungyeun, who had a great desire for growth, might feel that way.Which had made him form a contract with other administrators to acquire powers and become stronger based on them.In particular, the powers of the Iron-blooded Monarch were all so great that they were difficult to obtain despite their excellent utility.For sure, even if he broke through this trial, he wouldn't be able to buy quality powers with the SP he obtained.However\u2026\u201cIt'll be a little different starting from the 11th floor.\u201dWhether it's Murim, Callian, or Ares\u2026No administrator of any dimension would be able to keep up with the gift she had prepared for him.This thing she prepared for Han Sungyeun by enduring great restriction from the Tower was a sponsor that other challengers couldn't even dream of at this point.So\u2026Obviously, Han Sungyeun, who only pursued growth, wouldn't prioritize other administrators if he saw her prepared [Gift].\u201cTry your best, White Crane Sword Saint, Gluttony, or whoever it is.\u201dWhether he contracted with the second, or even third, administrator, it didn't matter to her now how many more administrators he'd have a contract with.\u201cIn the end, Han Sungyeun will choose me.\u201dHe'd surely do so to make himself stronger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He consumed his mana more and tried actively hunting the Earth snakes, but\u2026\u300cUsing the soul of the Earth snake to replenish mana.\u300d\u300cUsing the soul of the Earth snake to replenish stamina.\u300dStamina and mana weren't infinite, but finite resources.And since I could refill those resources right away, it was inevitable for me to have better durability than Oh ChoonsukAs a result, even though Oh Choonsuk's hunting speed was gradually slowing down, I could keep the pace without getting tired and continued the slaughter.\u300c 'One Man Army' achievement unlocked. \u300d\u300cAll stats increased by 1.\u300dThanks to that, I was able to obtain an achievement that increased all my stats by 1.However\u2026While Oh Choonsuk was falling behind, Kim Seunghoon was still smashing the heads of Earth Snakes at an insane speed, leaving his afterimages of lightning.Pow! Pow! Pow!As if bombs were exploding, a loud deafening roar could be heard from here and there.If it weren't for the stats that I trained with Necromancy, it wouldn't be strange if I lost my hearing immediately.It gave me goosebumps, and I couldn't help but admire him.A sky beyond the sky.Kim Seunghoon displayed overwhelming strength to the extent that everything I had experienced so far felt silly.Should I say it was like watching a wild beast with its pretty in front of it?It was surprising that he could make such agile movements even with a weapon like a hammer.To think that his attacks contained power that most challengers would be driven to the point of death to use, and in addition to that, he was so fast.'I'm even doubtful if he's really the same kind of human like us.'I was even consuming the souls that allowed me to permanently increase my stats to keep this pace\u2026Without anything like my power, Kim Seunghoon right now was in a state of continuing his insane hunting skills purely with his ability\u2026\u300cContribution ranking\u300d\u300c 1st place, Kim Seunghoon (196) \u300d\u300c 2nd place, Han Sungyeun (147) \u300d\u300c 3rd place, Oh Choonsuk (122) \u300dI had caught up to some extent, but now the gap wasn't narrowing at all.Even if I increased my contribution points, Kim Seunghoon's contribution points also went up as much as I raised them.Despite the fact that he had already accumulated so many contribution points, Kim Seunghoon was maintaining the gap between us without getting tired.Now was the time to admit things that should be admitted.'If I continue to compete with quantity like this, I'll end up losing.'It was a competition in which the starting line was completely different.No matter how much power I drew out to the limit, I couldn't turn the tables with the contribution points in this state.Yeah, this should be natural.The Evaluation Ranking wasn't absolute proof, but it was an indicator of combat power to some extent.How could I beat the person who was first place in the Evaluation Ranking?There was no way to get ahead of him as I was being pushed by his durability, which was my only advantage.However\u2026'The system said that the contribution points of this special task are given differently depending on the strength of each entity.'In fact, the larger Earth Snakes gave some additional contribution points.Recalling that fact in my head, I began to wait for that one moment.The point at which the strongest monster appeared in the trial of the 10th floor.Which was\u2026\u300c Half of the monsters on the 10th floor stage have been removed. \u300d\u300c The dungeon boss 'Darkness Devouring Snake' has appeared. \u300dThe appearance of boss monster\u2014 that's the condition for clearing this trial of the 10th floor.\u201cNow I'm finally starting to feel like I can win a little.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksIt was the moment when the light in the tunnel finally appeared.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Kim Seunghoon continued to observe Han Sungyeun's movements, even while killing all the Earth Snakes emerging from the ground.It wasn't because he had enough energy to observe him, but because the scene he was watching was purely unbelievable.Crash\u2014!With the speed that made even Kim Seunghoon flinch for an instant, Earth Snakes were brutally slaughtered by Han Sungyeun's sword.One, two, three\u2026Several small snakes were killed in a single strike, and large snakes died while being split in half by the sword as their backs were caught.In addition, his attack speed increased the more he swung the sword.Watching this scene, Kim Seunghoon felt astonished and a little caught off guard at the same time.'To think that kind of a monster wasn't originally a hunter but an ordinary person\u2026'He hadn't even thought that such a crazy monster could be hiding among ordinary people.His pure talent was quite high, and he had an unpredictable number of skills, and the power of those skills was outstanding.That wasn't the end of it.'His durability is on a whole new level.'Even though he was spamming his skills like that, he didn't show any signs of exhaustion. Rather, he was fighting with the corners of his lips slightly raised.Unlike his cold-hearted appearance a while ago, the current Han Sungyeun felt like a predator with a sword.An oddball.Han Sungyeun was a challenger that Kim Seungyun had no other words but to describe him like that.Of course, Kim Seunghoon felt like he had a long way to go to match with him, but\u2026Originally, Kim Seunghoon was one of the top hunters in the Korean hunter industry.Even if he lost most of the power he had when he entered the tower, that fact didn't change.The fact that he was showing the signs of keeping up with Kim Seunghoon meant that his potential was completely different.'A monster like him is appearing because of the tower's appearance, huh.'He was surprised as he thought that only some kind of scum was increasing their numbers.Kim Seunghoon was skeptical about the fact that Kim Seungjun or those who were worse than that bastard claimed to be hunters, but\u2026'Han Sungyeun is a challenger who's a completely different class from those guys.'For this time, he couldn't deny the beneficial effect created after the tower appeared.It was the moment when Kim Seunghoon began to have an increasingly strong interest in Han Sungyeun.\u300c Half of the monsters on the 10th floor stage have been removed. \u300d\u300c The dungeon boss 'Darkness Devouring Snake' has appeared. \u300dSuddenly, such a message came up, and the ground began to shake rapidly.Instead of panicking at the vibration that seemed like an earthquake, Kim Seunghoon immediately grasped the situation.The trial had already progressed enough for the boss monster to appear.By the time he fully embraced that fact, a huge Earth Snake was already in the middle of the field, flapping his earthen tongue.Darkness Devouring Snake.A dungeon boss, one of the monsters of all monsters that often appeared in field-type rank dungeons, materialized right in front of his eyes.'Are you saying that a boss monster this strong is appearing\u2026?'Darkness Devouring Snake was a notorious high-ranking monster even in rank dungeons.Despite its huge body being reminiscent of a dragon, the problem with it was its skill in narrowing the field of vision of all living things around it.It was safe to say that there was almost no way to counter it, as it was none other than an ability to seal off the sense of sight.Of course, it wasn't like there was no way to handle it at all.You could break through the reduced vision with a high level of mana resistance skill or an anti-magic skill comparable to that.However, as well as the mana resistance, the comparable resistance skill had to be higher than that of Kim Seunghoon's right now.Why?Because Veil of Darkness was an rank skill, and for that reason, it had amazing skill detection.With Kim Seunghoon's B+ Mana Resistance skill, it was difficult to overcome the skill detection of an rank skill.'Cooperation or whatever, we might all die if I don't hurry.'What was worse was that there were two other challengers, not just him.Kim Seunghoon stormed across the ground under the pressure that he needed to resolve this situation somehow.However\u2026Kieeeeeeeeeeegh\u2014!\u300c Due to the skill 'Veil of Darkness', your vision starts to narrow down. \u300d\u300c In proportion to the amount of mana used, the field of view also continually gets smaller. \u300dThe moment the Darkness Devouring Dnake immediately activated a special skill, Kim Seunghoon stopped moving.He had no choice but to do so.As the movement was loaded with mana, the amount of mana used increased, and the field of vision reduced.Therefore Kim Seunghoon had no choice but to stop using his mana and stare at the Darkness Devouring Snake.The Mana Resistance skill immediately activated, slowing down the reduction of the view, but\u2026'From now on, I need to continue the battle with a super sense rather than sight.'That didn't mean that the situation of the battle had gotten better.Oh Choonsuk was bewildered as though he couldn't see anything because he uses quite a lot of mana.Han Sungyeun was also standing still, staring at the Darkness Devouring snake.In other words, everyone wasn't so familiar with these kinds of enemies.If he had a bit more mana resistance, he wouldn't have been pressured by skills like Veil of Darkness at all, but that was a useless thought.Currently, Kim Seunghoon had lost all of his immense mana resistance by entering the tower.Of course, after climbing the tower and repeating battles, he acquired a B-rank mana resistance skill, but that wasn't enough to overcome the rank hit detection skill.Kim Seunghoon clenched his teeth and activated his mana throughout his body more and more strongly.Bzzzzzzt\u2026!!Accumulate damage to the Darkness Devouring Snake as much as possible before he completely becomes out of sight.And after that, deal with the Darkness Devouring Snake alone. Even if he was driven to the point of death with a lack of senses.Hunting monsters has always been the hunter's duty.That didn't change under any circumstances.Leave all the small monsters to Oh Choonseok and Han Sungyeun, and finish this stupidly strong monster by himself.That was the ideal solution for Kim Seunghoon in the current situation.However\u2026That plan of Kim Seunghoon was shattered the moment he raised the mana of the lightning.Slam!It's because there was someone who kicked off the ground faster than Kim Seunghoon.The challenger that Kim Seunghoon admired throughout the trial.It was Han Sungyeun.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Perhaps it was annoyed by the fact that I was rushing in after lifting up the veil by myself.Of course, that cry wasn't just for threatening.\u300c Due to skill 'Gaze of Darkness', all stats are decreased by -3. \u300d\u300c Due to skill 'Mana Resistance, the effect of the -3 decrease in all stats is canceled. \u300d\u300c Due to skill 'Touch of the Swamp', movement speed is decreased by -30%. \u300d\u300c Due to skill 'Forceful Breakthrough', the effect of the -30% decrease in movement speed is forcibly canceled.\u300dIf it hadn't been for the Forceful Breakthrough and Mana Resistance, I'd have become a cold corpse by now.As expected from a notorious boss monster that appears in rank dungeons, it had insane binding skills.Moreover, the skills activated at a distance to test the waters were at this level.Which meant?It meant that the Darkness Devouring Snake's skills at close range would be more threatening.'There's no need to let it run wild like that.'\u300c Activating the skill 'Wind's Blessing.' \u300d\u300c All speeds increased by 10%. \u300d\u300c Number of stacks \u2013 1/7 \u300dThe Wind's Blessing was activated instantly, and I became like a gust of wind.Whiiiiiiiish!Passing through the gap between Earth Snakes, I reached right in front of the Darkness Devouring Snake.Then, I jumped up off the ground without hesitation and swung the sword as hard as possible towards its jaws.\u300c Activating the power ' Lighting Sword Ki.' \u300dBaaaaaaang\u2026!!The Sword Ki formed on the blade was shot forward in a slash with lightning, resounding a huge impact sound.Would it receive damage to some extent because I used the Sword Ki?It was noticeable that its jaws made out of black mud had a few cracks.Even if it was an rank monster, it was no different in that it was helpless against Sword Ki.***[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]However, the Darkness Devouring Snake didn't just stand still and take it, as though it felt the danger of death.Whoosh!The Darkness Devouring Snake immediately swung its tail at me to take the initiative, but\u2026If I was that weak to be affected by such an obvious attack, I wouldn't have been able to stand here.Baaaaaaam!\u201cKugh\u2026\u201dI felt a thrill after immediately raising my leg and blocking the tail with one foot.To think that I blocked the attack of an rank monster with just one foot!Even if it wasn't a skill, but just a normal attack, it wasn't normal.'I guess I can no longer be treated like a regular human being anymore.'Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksIt seemed like I had already surpassed an ordinary hunter's standards long ago.It was then\u2014Kieeeeeee\u2026!Strange waves rang out from the Darkness Devouring Snake's tail, and my head began to throb.Pow!With that strange phenomenon, I immediately kicked its tail away and stepped back for a moment\u2026\u300c Due to power 'Resonance of Darkness', you're slowly being corrupted by the status effect: madness. \u300dAt the same time, I opened my eyes widely when I saw the message that the Darkness Devouring Snake used its power.A power?'I've never heard of monsters being able to use a power.'Skills could be used by monsters as well as by players.That's why I'd been able to absorb skills from monsters so far.However, power was the ability that challengers who belonged to the top ranks in the Tower of Trials acquired by contracting with the administrators.In fact, I'd never heard of a monster using power in real life, and I'd never seen it even after climbing the tower and having several fights.However\u2026The Darkness Devouring Snake used its power to shatter such common sense.Of course, I could understand immediately why it used its power.Should I say, as expected from Tower of Trials?'You're annoying me in so many ways.'They strengthened the monster to bring out a monster suitable for the hard difficulty level.I knew it from the moment I met the challenger from another world, but there were so many factors that it wouldn't be strange if I died suddenly like a molmola.Of course\u2026\u300cDue to power 'Serenity', The status effect: madness is lifted.\u300dI, who had prepared in advance for that factor that could've resulted in my death, wasn't normal as well.Status effect?'I don't know if it was poison, but I wouldn't get affected by this kind of thing.'Even though it was a variable I had never heard of or seen, I wasn't an ordinary challenger.I was a ranker who even signed a contract with an administrator with the right of a pioneer.I was able to overcome the factors that I had never experienced before adjusting to the situation.After immediately lifting the status effect through the power of Serenity, I quickly closed the distance I had increased for a moment and ran toward the Darkness Devouring Snake.Perhaps it was quite a prudent attack by the Darkness Devouring Snake, it was visibly bewildered, but that was only for a short while.Maybe the Darkness Devouring Snake realized that I was a great threat to its life?It started attacking immediately without even trying to poke around with debuff-type skills.You could see that it was trying its best, unlike a while ago, as it had a completely different force.And that prediction turned into reality in the next moment when the Darkness Devouring Snake made a full-fledged attack.Bwaaaaaaaaaaa!It opened its gigantic mouth and then shot a dark beam of light as if it were vomiting.Of course\u2026\u300c Activating the skill 'Counter Shield'. \u300d\u201cWell, this is even better for me.\u201dEven after seeing that destructive beam, I immediately activated the skill without panicking.I could've shot one more slash to stop it from shooting the beam at all, but\u2026I didn't do that because I had a deep thought that I could use its skill in reverse.Bababababababang!The dark beam struck the Counter shield and made a great impact, but it wasn't unbearable.Of course, 80% of my mana was consumed to withstand the impact, but\u2026\u300c Using the soul of the Earth Snake to replenish mana. \u300dEven that returned to its original state after replenishing the mana by absorbing a soul that I had.Whiirrr\u2026A message popped up at that moment when the power of the dark beam was diminishing.\u300c Charging complete. \u300d\u300c The skill 'Counter Shield' is in a state where you can reflect the accumulated damage. \u300dIt was a message that I could now start striking back.With the Counter Shield placed on the palm of my left hand, I immediately went to the back of the Darkness Devouring Snake.Of course, all the monsters nearby swarmed on me as though they weren't planning to just let it happen, but\u2026\u300c The skill 'Counter Shield' releases the accumulated damage at once. \u300dBaaaaaaaaaaang!All the monsters that were swarming me were eliminated by the dark beam emitted from the shield on my left hand.Despite that, the Darkness Devouring Snake wasn't showing any movement.Did it get a rebound from using a skill that's quite powerful?Even until I wiped out all the Earth Snakes, it didn't show any proper movements.Seizing that opportunity, I stepped on its shadow, immediately activated the Lightning Sword Ki, and thrust my sword.\u300c Activating the skill 'Clandestine Shadow's Step.' \u300d\u300cYou're stepping on the shadow of a living creature.\u300d\u300cYour strength temporarily increases by +3.\u300dFirst, my strength increased by +3 as I stepped on a shadow.\u300c Activating the skill 'Gust Blade'. \u300d\u300c Skill 'Gust Blade' imbues wind element to the blade. \u300dEven the wind was mixed with the blade by activating Gust Blade.And when I thrust the sword as it was, a streak of wind lightning was fired.Boooom!When the slash shot through the thrust touched the back of the Darkness Devouring Snake, the center of its upper body was completely penetrated.\u300c You have slain a Darkness Devouring Snake. \u300d\u300c Calculating the contribution points\u2026 \u300d\u300c You hunted the Darkness Devouring Snake alone without anyone's help. \u300d\u300c Challenger Han Sungyeun has a 100% stake in hunting the boss monster. \u300d\u300c Calculation complete. \u300d\u300c You gain 278 contribution points. \u300dA clean finish.\u300c Special task, 'contribution' will now end. \u300d\u300c Challenger Han sungyeun took 1st place in the contribution ranking. \u300d\u300c Challenger Han sungyeun will receive an additional reward after the trial is over. \u300dAnd it was a clean turnaround.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don't think even Seunghoon-hyungnim had anything like that\u2026\u201dOf course.Forceful Breakthrough was an original skill created by combining Sustain Battle and Contempt For The Weak.Sustain Battle, as well as Contempt For The Weak\u2014 their ranks were low, but the value of these skills was greater than that of other useless skills.Of course, It didn't match well with me, so I didn't hesitate to throw them in a combination, though.\u201c\u2026Did you perhaps acquire that skill through skill combination, too?\u201d\u201cAs expected from someone who has the same radiance as me, you know it well.\u201d\u201cEven if the difficulty is on hard, the Tower doesn't give you such insane skills, you see.\u201dOh Choonsuk said so as though he was dumbfounded and let out a deep sigh.\u201cThen I wouldn't be able to acquire that skill in any way.\u201dI wonder what this meant?Wouldn't be able to learn this skill in any way\u2026Not because I wasn't telling him how I got it, but he sounded like there's no way to learn it at all.At that, I opened my mouth after thinking for a while.\u201cWhat do you mean by you can't acquire the skill?\u201d\u201cBecause that's an original skill created by skill combination.\u201d\u201cBut wouldn't the same result be obtained using the same combination method?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201dOh Choonsuk smiled bitterly and continued his words.\u201cYou can't create the same skill created by skill combination twice.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d\u201cLooks like you didn't ask the administrator anything?\u201d\u201cSkills created by skill combinations exist as originals. Skill acquisition methods and aptitudes don't exist, and there's no way to make it twice.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cIn a nutshell, even if I use the same combination method, I can't make that game-breaking skill combined by you, Han Sungyeun-ssi, no matter what.\u201dSo\u2026According to those words, the 'Forceful Breakthrough' I combined was an original skill, so it had become a unique ability that couldn't be made twice.And it also meant that I couldn't learn the skill by following the combination method of other skills.At that, I closed my mouth for a moment, then opened my mouth with a feigned smile.\u201c\u2026It's a system that only the challengers who're active at PvP would like.\u201dPlayer vs. player.Those who specialize in battles between challengers would love this system.In any case, this would mean that not all potential competitors would acquire the same skills they had acquired.Perhaps Oh Choonsuk thought so too, he smiled bitterly, and Kim Seunghoon, who was next to him, shed a bloody laugh.\u201cNot really. Not many people would be able to properly utilize skill combinations so\u2026\u00a0 It's just an ability that doesn't matter whether it exists or not.\u201dAt his words, Oh Choonsuk let out a helpless laugh and nodded his head.\u201cThat's also true, too. In fact, if you don't have a lot of skills, Skill Combination is an ability that can't be used properly. Just like me right now.\u201dOh Choonsuk, who was speaking in a tone that left a trace of slight regret, mumbled a little bit, and\u2026\u201cHowever\u2026\u201dSoon he turned his head and looked at me as though there were people who aren't like that.Following that gaze, Kim Seunghoon also turned his head to look at me, and he opened his mouth after being silent for a moment.\u201c\u2026But there are exceptions wherever you go.\u201dI let out a bitter smile at the gaze that seemed to be looking at some kind of different race, and Kim seunghoon let out a sigh.\u201cAnd that's what we call an oddball.\u201dIn short, he meant that I was an extraordinary being.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]The three of us chatted for just a while.At the end of our Trial, we didn't have anything special to say, so we decided to talk lightly through the friend function and returned to the waiting room.It was natural.No one who climbed the Tower of Trial would be negligent or delay checking the rewards.I also entered the waiting room right away to check and use the rewards obtained in the Trial of the 10th floor.And\u2026\u300c More than a 1000 people have cleared the 10th Trial. \u300d\u300c The system expansion is starting. \u300dUpon entering the waiting room, the system began to expand after a long time.\u300c 'Dimension Shifting' is being added to the marketplace category. \u300dThe first expansion was a 'Dimension Shifting' function out of the blue.Looks like it was made to allow traveling to another dimension, but\u2026Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'That's a meaningless expansion.'I wonder how many people would like to move from the Earth dimension to another dimension?Dimension Shifting in a situation where a lot of people were dying due to challengers from another world.In fact, it was a feature that even suicidal people wouldn't use.\u300c The [Observation Territory] of the administrator of Earth dimension is expanded. \u300d\u300c The [Interfere Territory] of the administrator of Earth dimension is expanded. \u300dThe second expansion was the [Observation Territory] and [Interfere Territory] of the administrators.\u300c Due to the expansion of the Earth dimension administrator's [Observation Territory], it is now possible to communicate with the administrator who has consistently shown interest and supported the power even in the waiting room. \u300d\u300c Due to the expansion of the Earth dimension administrator's [Interfere territory], the challenger will be able to have additional contracts with the administrator and move to the administrator's territory. \u300dIn short, communication with administrators will be available even in the waiting room, just like in trials.And the main content was that challengers could make additional contracts with other administrators.Of course\u2026\u300c However, at this time, the additional contract with the administrator can be made only once, and thereafter, the additional contract will be limited. \u300dRestrictions existed regarding additional contracts.\u201cSo in short, the additional contract is literally an additional contract, unlike the previous contract.\u201dI wouldn't be able to cancel the original contract with the Iron-blooded Monarch since it was my first contract, but\u2026I could end the relationship at any time if I had an additional contract with other administrators.'But wouldn't it just be the administrator's loss in this case?'I mean, it was good for me, but I thought that only the administrator who was going to sign an additional contract would undergo a loss in this case.However, since the administrator is also being employed by the tower, there must be some kind of benefit.For that reason, I immediately cleared my doubts about those and opened my inventory.It was to check the reward that I had acquired after clearing the Trial of the 10th floor.\u300c Skill Proficiency Potion \u300d\u300c Rank: B+ \u300d\u300c A special potion specially brewed by the Tower for those with skills. \u300d\u300c Upon consuming it, you can arbitrarily increase the Proficiency of one of your skills by 20%. \u300dInsane.I smiled softly at the effect that I had no other choice but to say so.A potion that increases skill proficiency?As a matter of fact, this potion was no different from a welcome rain in a drought, as I was suffering due to the slow growth of skill ranks.\u201cStatus.\u201d\u300c Han Sungyeun \u300d\u300c Radiance \u2013 Conqueror ]\u300c Strength \u2013 72 \u300d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u300c Stamina \u2013 70 \u300d\u300c Agility \u2013 70 \u300d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u300c Mana \u2013 67 \u300d\u300c Tenacity \u2013 66 \u300d\u300c Innate ability \u2013 Necromancy (C) \u300d\u300c Innate power \u2013 Skill Combination \u300d\u300c Power \u2013 Serenity (C-), Sword Ki Master (C+) \u300d\u300c Skill \u2013 See details \u300dWould it be because there was not a single day where I neglected becoming stronger?Originally, the numbers of my stats weren't this high, but now I'd become like a monster.Even the skills I had in the combined Trial on the 10th floor had grown quite a bit, so in fact, my strength was greatly enhanced.However, I didn't open the status window to check that, but\u2026It was to check the Proficiency of the current skills before using the Skill Proficiency Potion.Putting aside all the small skills, I opened the description window of only the skills with high power.\u300c Skill \u2013 Triple Laceration () \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 31.7% \u300d\u300c Basic effect \u2013 Using mana, strengthen a blade for three attacks. \u300d\u300c Detailed effect \u2013 Upon using the skill, the cutting force of bladed attacks increases by 1.5/2.0/2.5 times after each attack. \u300dTriple Laceration had high power, but it had low Proficiency, perhaps because I didn't use it that much.It could be said that the Proficiency was raised well since the Proficiency of an rank skill that wasn't used well is 31.7%, but\u2026'But that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a skill that I've developed well enough for me to use the Skill Proficiency Potion.'I decided to pass on the Triple Laceration skill and moved to another skill.\u300c Skill \u2013 Wind's Blessing () \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 83.2% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 Upon declaring the skill name, increase all speeds by 10%. This effect can be stacked up to seven times. Upon reaching max stacks, the skill receives a one-day cooldown. \u300dIt's no exaggeration to say that the Wind's Blessing was my main skill since I used it so often that my Proficiency had already risen this much.'Moreover, if I use the skill proficiency potion, it's a skill that it'll immediately rise up to A rank.'In fact, it was so different that I had decided on which skill to increase my Proficiency at this point.However, it felt like something had gone undone, so I checked out the other skills a little bit more.But in conclusion, my options didn't increase.It was understandable.\u300c Skill \u2013 Lighting Sword Ki (B) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 7.3% \u300d\u300c Explanation \u2013 The Flickering Lightning Clan's signature ability. \u300d\u300c Basic effect \u2013 Lighting imbues itself onto your sword ki. This effect cannot be activated by those who can't use sword ki. \u300d\u300c Additional effect \u2013 Upon activation, your ability to control the sword ki increases greatly and also allows you to discharge the sword ki. \u300dThe skill proficiency of Lightning Sword Ki hadn't risen much yet, as it was obtained by absorbing the soul of Baek Sunhak in the arena.\u300c Skill \u2013 Ashen Blood (B-) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 47.8% \u300d\u300c Explanation \u2013 An transcendent trait developed by a mutant vampire. \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 The user's regeneration increases proportionally to the user's tenacity. The regeneration is increased by 3 fold when inflicted bodily harm, and up to 40% of the pain is blocked depending on the damage. \u300dAshen Blood had a pretty high level of Proficiency, but it wasn't possible to achieve a rank increase with a Proficiency increase of 20%.\u300c Skill \u2013 Counter Shield (B)\u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 2.8% \u300d\u300c Basic Effect \u2013\u00a0 When you cast the skill, you can summon a red shield formed with mana. \u300d\u300c Additional Effect \u2013\u00a0 The size and strength of the shield can be adjusted in proportion to the amount of mana you pour, and the generated shield can reflect 25% of damage received. At this time, as long as the shield isn't broken, damage can be accumulated and released at once. \u300dMost of the newly combined skills, including the Counter Shield, didn't surpass 5% of their Proficiency.\u300c You have consumed a skill proficiency potion (B+). \u300d\u300c Please choose a skill to increase your Proficiency. \u300d\u201cWind's Blessing.\u201d\u300c Confirmed. \u300d\u300c Challenger Han Sungyeun's skill proficiency of 'Wind's Blessing ()' increases by 20%. \u300d\u300c Skill 'Wind's Blessing ()'s Proficiency reached 100%. \u300d\u300c Skill 'Wind's Blessing ()'s ranked up. \u300d\u201cOh\u2026\u201dSince it was an item obtained as a reward for breaking through a trial, the effect was certain.I opened the status window with anticipation at the message that Wind's Blessing had risen up to Rank A.No, to be precise, I was going to open the status window.However\u2026The two messages that popped up forced my finger to stop opening it.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' invites you to the administrator territory. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' invites you to the administrator territory. \u300dI was invited by an administrator.Not one, but two at the same time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Well, should I say you made such a choice?\u201dAfter thinking about what I did for a moment, the answer immediately popped up.'Is it because of the choice I made when I was invited to the administrator's territory earlier\u2026?'She might have liked that I chose her after contemplating which one to choose between the Iron-blooded Monarch and the White Crane Sword Saint.\u201cThanks to you, I won the bet with the other administrators, and well, I don't feel bad in many ways.\u201dI didn't bother to ask what she was betting on and who she was betting with.Because somehow, I felt like I knew the answer.'I was wondering why they sent the invite at the same time, so it was for something like that\u2026'Now I seemed to understand exactly why the Iron-blooded Monarch was smiling.To think that she made such a foolish bet and was so happy about winning that bet.I could even feel a sense of cuteness in the behavior that was far from her first impression, which was a cold-hearted beauty.\u201c\u2026Why are you looking at me with that kind of eyes?\u201d\u201cNo, I was just looking at you.\u201d\u201cYour eyes were a little disquieting\u2026\u201d\u201cMust be your imagination.\u201dAs I somehow made excuses to the Iron-blooded Monarch, she stared at me for a moment and then shrugged her shoulders.\u201c\u2026Well, I guess it doesn't matter. Anyway, let's put aside the things that don't matter and talk about the main point.\u201dAs soon as I heard the word, the main point. I immediately looked at her with my eyes shining.'So she did have something to talk about.'What kind of administrator would summon a contractor just for a bet?The bet she was talking about was only a secondary factor, and she had a separate main point.Having felt that, I intuitively asked her.\u201cAre you finally telling me why you called me here?\u201d\u201cSo you did assume that I called you because I had a separate business with you.\u201d\u201cTo some extent. We aren't close to calling each other out to talk about useless things.\u201d\u201cI think that's a bit sad to hear when we even signed a contract, but\u2026\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe Iron-blooded Monarch made a disappointed face for a moment but soon smiled and changed her expression.\u201cUnfortunately, that's the correct answer.\u201d\u201cYou know that the system expanded when you reached the 11th floor waiting room, right?\u201d\u201cYes, I do. That's why I was able to come here.\u201dI was pretty sure it was the Dimension Shifting function and expansion of the Observation and Interfere territories of the administrators\u2026?I was able to come to the administrator's territory thanks to that, so there's no way I wouldn't know.\u201cThen I guess there's nothing to explain further.\u201dThe Iron-blooded Monarch made a satisfied face and then continued.\u201cThe expansion of the administrator's Interfere area wasn't made just to include functions such as invitations to the administrator's territory.\u201d\u201cThe real purpose of the expansion of the Interfere area is to allow administrators to properly nurture the challengers.\u201d\u201cPlease explain in more detail.\u201d\u201cInstead of explaining it, it's something like this.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201dThe moment I was bewildered, the Iron-blooded Monarch snapped her finger without hesitation.Snap!And\u2026\u300c The administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is gifting power to their contractor using [Interefere Territory]. \u300d\u300c You can acquire one of the powers sold by administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' at random. \u300dAt the same time, a gift I couldn't have imagined was poured out on me.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]I couldn't come to my senses and stared blankly at the message that appeared in front of me for a while.\u300c The administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is gifting power to their contractor using [Interefere Territory]. \u300d\u300c You can acquire one of the powers sold by administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' at random. \u300dI can acquire a power at random?This was like a bolt out of the blue for me, who had been collecting SP like a madman by breaking through the trials.\u201c\u2026Can you actually give people powers like this randomly?\u201dI couldn't hold back my question and immediately asked the Iron-blooded Monarch in the end.If this thing called power was something that could freely be given at the administrators' discretion\u2026\u201cNot a chance.\u201dBut what came back wasn't the answer I was expecting.\u201cThe Tower never lets you give anything for nothing.\u201d\u201cMoreover, as the nurturing of the contractor returns as a profit of the administrator, there's no way that the administrator could give power casually in terms of structure.\u201d\u201cWhich means\u2026?\u201d\u201cIt means that I've already paid enough price to the Tower to be able to gift a power randomly.\u201dI couldn't understand.If it wasn't that easy to give powers, then why\u00a0 was she giving me a power like this?Curiosity arose about that, and I couldn't help but let that question come out of my mouth.\u201cWhy are you helping me this much?\u201dI just couldn't understand why she was paying such a price just to give me power.For the Iron-blooded Monarch, even if I was her first contractor, my value wasn't that high.If you looked at the challengers from another world, their potential was much higher than those from the Earth dimension.But why was she paying such a price to give power to me, who couldn't even take first place in the earth dimension?'It might be better for her to find another challenger since the additional contract function has been added.'As I was lost in thought with those, the Iron blooded Monarch opened her mouth.\u201c\u2026I see. For you, his kind of treatment would be shocking.\u201cTo be honest, your power isn't bad, Iron-blooded Monarch.\u201d\u201cAlthough the price is high, the powers are quite useful, and there are many aspects that should be better than other administrators.\u201dNone of the challengers I'd ever seen had the power of an administrator so strong.Even in cases such as Katheryn Benette or Kim Seungjun, their powers weren't that strong.Of course, even though they seemed to have combat-related powers, their strength wasn't as strong as a skill.On the other hand, among the powers of the Iron-blooded Monarch that I could purchase, many abilities were several times better than the skills, as they were specialized in combat.In particular, it was hard to estimate the value of the powers, such as Serenity, which removes a penalty-related ability.\u201cI don't understand why such a person is willing to go this far for me.\u201dThen the Iron-blooded Monarch let out a deep sigh and spoke.\u201c\u2026Looks like you won't accept it even if I said you're the first contract that I signed a contract with in decades.\u201dThe Iron-blooded Monarch continued talking while twisting her long silver hair as if there was nothing more to hide.\u201cI saw a possibility in you, and that's why I'm investing like this.\u201d\u201cPossibility\u2026?\u201d\u201cThe administrators receive additional rewards according to the level to which they nurture the challengers, but they're never nurturing challengers for that purpose. Everyone invests in the challenger to achieve their own earnest wish. It's safe to say that I'm no different on that matter.\u201dHer eyes suddenly became serious as though she had a wish to be fulfilled.\u201c\u2026I can't tell you right now because it's not yet the right time for it, but one day you'll know.\u201dAlthough the conclusion wasn't clearly made, at least I felt more comfortable.Because, after all, the favor that the Iron-blooded Monarch provided me wasn't without reason.There was no such thing as free in the world.For that reason, I thought there was a possibility that I was being used, but\u2026Seeing the Iron-blooded Monarch get serious for an instant, it seems like she had high hopes for me.'I don't know what the hell she means by that earnest wish, but\u2026 I guess it doesn't matter.'The Iron-blooded Monarch did tell me that I'd find it out later and\u2026More than anything else, it took a huge part that she saw me as an equal trade opponent.Give and take.If there's anything she wants as much as she gives me, it means I have the initiative.Ultimately, that earnest wish she wants to achieve will be achieved only when I become strong.Therefore, I silently accepted the system message without saying a word.\u300c You'll randomly acquire one of the powers sold by the administrator 'Iron-Blooded Monarch'. \u300dThe Iron-blooded Monarch saw me as a legitimate trade partner and a contractor.Then there was nothing to hesitate for.Whaaaaap!\u300c A new power is being engraved on your soul\u2026! \u300dI'll take what I need to take and achieve the things that need to be achieved and continue to grow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was probably because I had obtained many rewards several times.Let's say, just a fine feeling that I got a good card in my hand?I had no other feelings than that.Would it be because of that?\u201c\u2026Don't tell me you got the most useless power?\u201dThe Iron-Blooded Monarch, who was sitting down and observing me, widened her eyes and asked me that question.Of course, I didn't get as bad of a power as she thought, so I immediately shook my head.\u201cI got the power I thought I needed at this point.\u201d\u201cI've obtained the Sword of Iron-blood.\u201d\u201cThat's\u2026 Amazing.\u201dThe Iron-blooded Monarch continued speaking as though she was relieved.\u201cSword of Iron-blood is an ability that I enjoyed using before. The higher the level of the swordsmanship skill, and the higher the mana is, the stronger the sword becomes.\u201dThe ability to grow stronger according to the caster's growth.And other than that, there were a lot of pretty good options when I read it before.\u201cPlus, the necessity to purchase an item related to the sword disappears too.\u201d\u201cThat's correct. You can pretend not to use a sword and suddenly summon it to make a surprise attack.\u201dIn fact, no other ability was as important as this for someone who uses a sword.After exchanging a conversation, the Iron-Blooded Monarch smiled as if her mood lightened up.\u201cI guess it was worth it to use the points I've accumulated so far to give you the gift.\u201dShe was clearly expecting something from me in her tone, emphasizing that she had made a loss by granting me power.I immediately realized what it was and opened my mouth.\u201cThank you. It'll definitely be a power that'll aid me forever.\u201dThe Iron-blooded Monarch twitched the corners of her mouth and curled her eyebrows.\u201cYou don't have to mention it\u2026 doing this much is nothing for my precious contractor.\u201dAfter saying that, the Iron-blooded Monarch picked up the snack on the table and chewed it.Following that, I also took a bite of the snack and chewed it, and she soon opened her mouth again.\u201cNow that I've given you the power that I wanted to give, let's talk about something else.\u201d\u201cWhat I'm going to talk about now will spend your rights to your questions. Would that be alright with you?\u201d\u201cHow come?\u201d\u201cUnlike other information, the tower will impose sanctions on me if I tell you these without any cost.\u201dInformation important enough that the tower could impose sanctions on her?I answered while nodding my head as it definitely wouldn't be some kind of nonsense.\u201cSure. I didn't really have anywhere to use it, so I just kept on stacking it.\u201dIt was just then when I answered so\u2014\u300c All question rights held by the challenger, Han Sungyeun, will be consumed. \u300dI was bewildered by the message that all of the question rights I had were used up instantly.'\u2026Just how important is this story going to be?'I had a lot of question rights left since there had been very few cases where I used the question.However, as soon as all the question rights were used, I noticed that the story from now on wouldn't be anything ordinary.At that, as I looked at the Iron-blooded Monarch with a serious expression, she soon opened her mouth.\u201cPreviously, you must've killed a challenger from another world on the 9th floor.\u201d\u201c\u2026Yes. It was the first time I met a challenger from a Murim world, so I had a hard time too.\u201dI could still clearly remember the name of the challenger I encountered at that time.Baek Sunhak.The old man who introduced himself as the Elder of the Murim alliance was a challenger from another world who appeared on the 9th floor.\u201c\u2026But why are you mentioning that all of a sudden?\u201d\u201cIt seems that the title of the old tiger became a problem.\u201d\u201cBecause of his title, Elder of the Murim Alliance, a person is looking for you from the dimension of Murim.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean\u2026\u201d\u201cIt must be so-called revenge.\u201dHe just died because he failed on an intrusion to a floor, but an act of revenge?I scoffed, aghast at those absurd remarks.\u201cDon't tell me the Murim alliance is some unpeaceful organization?\u201dIt could be if it was made up of unscrupulous people like gangsters, Yakuza, or Mafia.However\u2026\u201cNo, in fact, they're rather a group of moderates in the Murim, though\u2026\u201dI spit out curses to the response of the Iron-blooded Monarch's begrudging answer.\u201cHow can those sons of bitches be\u2026\u201dTo think that they're making a fuss pointing a blade at me, blabbering things about payback or whatever.Moreover, the ones doing this act were moderate organizations in the dimension of Murim.All kinds of cuss words came to my mind in an instant, but I put up with it and opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026So are you saying that the Murim alliance is after me to kill me?\u201dIn conclusion, she said that someone was searching for me, so I thought it was the Murim alliance.And as much as they were making a fuss about paying the grudge back, I thought they'd send me a tracer to kill me.But that wasn't it.\u201cThat's not it.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cThe Murim alliance is rather unsettled, and I heard that they're just busy trying to take the place of the man in power.\u201d\u201cThe Murim alliance will search for you and remember you, but they'll not make a huge movement to eliminate you right now.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksIn short, it means that they're more busy acting to occupy the vacant place of Baek Sunhak than killing me.After hearing that, it became even harder to figure out who was trying to kill me.\u201cThen who the hell is trying to kill me?\u201dI asked the question without hesitation, but the answer that returned was an answer I couldn't have imagined.\u201cThe Namgung noble family.\u201d\u201cThe Sword Dragon of the Namgung noble family is looking for you.\u201dSomeone I'd never met was looking for me.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]I wonder how much time had passed?After the Iron-blooded Monarch gave some explanations, I could grasp the situation.\u201c\u2026So, to sum things up, a noble family that's like a pillar of the Murim alliance recognized me, and they're running wild to kill me, huh.\u201d\u201cTo be precise, the only aristocratic family doing that is the Namgung noble family, and even within them, only Namgung Hyuk, the young master, is looking for you.\u201d\u201cThat's ridiculous.\u201dIt was really ridiculous.To think a guy who had nothing to do with me was looking to kill me when the Murim alliance wasn't doing anything\u2026'How in the world does the way of thinking work in the people of the Murim?'I was getting goosebumps at this point.I was on the verge of death due to Baek Sunhak's preemptive attack, but I had a narrow escape from death.But the fact that Murim still had justification to kill me was surprising.However, the Iron-blooded Monarch spoke as though that was natural.\u201cI don't know why he's looking for you\u2026 but when Murim searches for a person, it doesn't really end well.\u201dIn those words, the experience of having heard of numerous incidents was on it.\u201cThen that means I won't have a good ending like the countless precedents.\u201d\u201cSomething like that. I think you should be prepared for a battle of life and death at least.\u201d\u201cDon't tell me, are you acquainted with that young master of the Namgung noble family?\u201d\u201cI'll be damned if that's true. The young master of the Namgung noble family is a greenhorn who's just twenty years old.\u201dThe Iron-Blooded Monarch scoffed and brushed her frizzy hair backward.\u201cI've been an administrator for several decades. The years I've lived from him are completely different.\u201d\u201cThen how do you know about the young master of the Namgung noble family?\u201d\u201cThere's a way to know everything. Well, that doesn't matter, so let's move on\u2026.\u201dThe Iron-blooded Monarch evaded the point all of a sudden, narrowed her eyes, and said.\u201cThe young master of the Namgung noble family is probably several times stronger than you.\u201d\u201cHe must be a fairly-high level challenger since he has reached the 20th floor in the Tower of Trials.\u201d\u201c20th floor? Then don't I have a chance at winning?\u201d\u201cNot at all.\u201dWhen I tilted my head at her confident denial, quickly, she answered.\u201cThe challengers of the Murim dimension are at an entirely new level in terms of the strength of their own body. It's a world in which only those who've been insane about martial arts have lived for hundreds and thousands of years. As it's a world full of people who have honed their strength and become godlike, no other world can look down on the effectiveness of their method for enhancing their strength.\u201dHearing that, I had no other choice but to keep my mouth shut.A world where hundreds and thousands of years have been devoted to martial arts.How strong would the ones who grew up in such a world be?'Even Baek Sunhak, although his physical abilities and skills were limited, he still overwhelmed me.'What was worse was that it was after defeating that black knight I met on the 5th floor.I was prepared, and I had the confidence that I wouldn't be as helpless as before.But I couldn't help but marvel at an old man's unbelievable strength.He tried to give me death till the very end by increasing his speed to impede my movement.On the other hand, I was almost defeated even though I was equipped with a strength that didn't match the floor level with an ability that specializes in growth.That difference was huge, and I quickly accepted it calmly.\u201cThen he's on a completely different level from me, huh.\u201d\u201cIt'll be difficult for you to survive if you face him directly on a floor.\u201dIt was only for a moment that I laughed bitterly at the death sentence I had not heard in a long time.\u201cBut it's not entirely impossible, so I'll give you the information I know for now.\u201dAs soon as she started talking about the young master of the Namgung noble family, I started to concentrate.The words that followed were something to be listened to carefully.Sword Dragon of the Blue Sky.He's a person who uses the grand nickname, which meant dragon of the sword that rules the blue sky.At the same time, he was the next master of the family who'd inherit the Namgung noble family, a famous family in Murim.And his real name is Namgung Hyuk, and there was no one who wouldn't know his name when you mentioned it to any challengers from the Murim dimension.His swordsmanship would surpass rank in terms of skill level, and so on and so forth. A lot of talks were exchanged.Only after devising a plan against him did the conversation's heat cool down, and the Iron-blooded Monarch gave permission to leave.\u201c\u2026It seems I have told you everything I can, so you may leave now.\u201dI nodded at the voice that seemed to have achieved all her goals.Originally, I was in the middle of checking the rewards in the waiting room, so I didn't have time to stay any longer.\u201cAlright. Then I'll see you in the waiting room on the 12th floor next time we meet.\u201dThe Iron-blooded Monarch responded with satisfaction to my brief words\u2026\u201cI'll be looking forward to your future.\u201d\u300c Moving to the 11th floor waiting room .\u300dThen, a message appeared in my sight, and the place changed instantly.From a medieval-style hut full of gloominess to a desolate waiting room.Of course, I was quietly adapting to it and was going to continue what I had to do, but\u2026Ring! Ring! Ring!\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' invites you to the administrator territory. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' invites you to the admini\u2026 \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' invites you to\u2026 \u300dAt the invitation messages that popped up in an instant, I had no choice but to stop what I was about to do.The administrator White Crane Sword Saint had sent me an invitation.Not just once, but countless times.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

you to the admini\u2026 \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' invites you to\u2026 \u300dIt was only a brief moment that I was bewildered by the countless invitation messages pouring in.Soon, I realized why the White Crane Sword Saint sent out so many invitation messages.'Is this because I didn't accept her invitation when she invited me at the same time as the Iron-Blooded Monarch?'It was just a speculation, but perhaps the White Crane Sword Saint thought I had no intention of accepting an invitation.So I wondered if that was why she was restlessly sending the invitation message out of impatience.In any case, even with the system expansion this time, they said that the [additional contract] can only be made once, so it couldn't be helped for him but to be anxious as an administrator.After assuming up to that point, I immediately opened my mouth.The administrator's observation territory had now been expanded, and they said that the administrators could watch the challengers not only on the trial stage but also in the waiting room.Which means?'It would mean the White Crane Sword Saint is also looking at me.'It was also an opportunity to tell the White Crane Sword Saint that I had a will to sign an additional contract as well.White Crane Sword Saint.The power this administrator has isn't something to be taken lightly.Even the power of Sword Ki mastery was already overpowered, what else could there be if it's the other ones?Although there may not be that many powers that are at the level of Sword Ki Mastery, there would be quite a few.Therefore, I concluded that there was nothing wrong with signing an additional contract with the White Crane Sword Saint.\u201c\u2026It's not that I'm not planning to accept the invitation.\u201dThere was no need for me to tell the White Crane Sword Saint all this and that.Such as why I prioritized the invitation sent by the Iron-Blooded Monarch or didn't accept her invitation immediately.The White Crane Sword Saint wasn't that foolish for me to explain all of that one by one.\u201cI just need a little time to prepare, so please wait, and I'll accept the invitation soon.\u201dPerhaps the White Crane Sword Saint became aware that I was willing to sign an additional contract?\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' puffs out her cheeks and replies that she understood it. \u300dSuch a message came up, and finally, the invitation messages pouring down like rain became silent.I didn't feel so comfortable looking at the message of an administrator who seemed to be quite elderly, inflating her cheeks, though.Seeing that administrator messages aren't popping up, I guess she understood the meaning of what I said.'Actually, I could've just responded to the White Crane, but\u2026.'I didn't immediately accept the invitation of the White Crane Sword Saint on purpose.This was for me to take the front foot in dealing with the administrator.Those who didn't know their own worth must've responded to this invitation and signed a contract immediately, but\u2026After meeting Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonsuk this time, I clearly realized how absurd I was as a challenger.'Except for Kim Seunghoon, there's no one that can be compared to me on the Korean server right now.'At least among Korea's challengers, probably no one had achieved growth as well as I did.Therefore, I'd be a pretty attractive contract partner for an administrator who trains challengers and gets rewarded by the Tower.The first contract was arranged by the Tower, but additional contracts could be made under the agreement between the challenger and the administrator.For that reason, the White Crane Sword Saint, who had been watching me since the 9th floor, felt impatient and sent me an invitation as soon as the [Interfere Territory] was expanded.'It would mean that the White Crane Sword Saint is quite interested in me.'Then I had to make use of it.By establishing that I was the one who was taking the lead in terms of additional contracts and moving to the administrator territory.And at the same time, make the White Crane Sword Saint think I was already caught in her fishnet so she couldn't take me lightly.In this way, I'd be able to maintain my value for a longer period of time.It was simple psychological warfare.By nature, human beings tend to be more obsessed with jewels that are about to be reached than the jewels held in their hands.Of course, such a reason was the basis for not accepting the invitation right away, but\u2026That didn't mean I turned down the invitation when I had nothing to do.I had to properly check the Wind's Blessing, which I couldn't previously because I was talking to the Iron-Blooded Monarch.And I was also going to convert the soul that the [Darkness Devouring Snake] left in the trial of the 10th floor into stats.As I knew clearly what to do, I opened the skill window of Wind's Blessing without wasting any more time.And\u2026\u300c Skill \u2013 Wind's Blessing () \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 Upon declaring the skill name, increase all speeds by 10%. This effect can be stacked up to seven times. Upon reaching max stacks, 1% of total mana will be consumed every minute.. \u300dUpon seeing the skill window of Wind's Blessing, I couldn't help but be astonished.\u201cOh\u2026\u201dThe cooldown given as a penalty for the final stack had disappeared.To be accurate, the penalty of the final stack didn't disappear but was changed to a penalty of consuming 1% of total mana power every minute, though\u2026At least I felt satisfied that I wouldn't experience as many troubling situations because of not being able to use the Wind's Blessing.'Well, for mana, I'll just have to make an alternate method to replenish it anyway\u2026'Obviously, in this case, 1% of the total mana would be consumed every minute, so the regeneration amount would be more important than the amount of mana pool.While thinking about that, I absorbed the soul of the Darkness Devouring snake.This was to prevent it from being consumed by Necromancy's passive shield by any chance.\u300c Permanently increasing your stats by absorbing the soul of Darkness devouring snake. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 4. \u300d\u300c Agility increased by 3. \u300d\u300c Stamina increased by 3. \u300d\u300c Mana increased by 6. \u300d\u300c Tenacity increased by 4. \u300dAs a bunch of stats went up, the pleasure of growth rose up all over my body.Considering the difficulty of hunting the Darkness Devouring Snake, which was surprisingly easy, it was a pretty good reward, but\u2026\u300c Acquiring one of the Darkness Devouring Snake's skills. \u300dMaybe I was lucky this time. The rewards didn't stop there this time around.\u300c You have received the skill 'Mana Operation ()'. \u300dOne of the Darkness Devouring Snake's skills was acquired through skill absorption, which is activated with a certain probability.It was a whopping rank, not just a random mediocre ranked skill.\u300c Skill \u2013 Mana Operation () \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 With regards to mana operation, you have stepped into the realm of natural talent, and most of the restrictions related to mana management will be lifted. However, skill proficiency increases only through independent realization, and the frequency of usage doesn't affect Proficiency.\u300d\u201c\u2026I was really lucky.\u201dNo way\u2026 to think that I was able to acquire this kind of skill by absorbing the soul.rank skills were rarely dropped, even as a reward for trial, but acquiring it through Necromancy?Currently, I could say that it was like I won a lottery.'Every time this happens, it sinks in that Necromancy is an overpowered innate ability.'When it comes to growth, other innate abilities wouldn't be able to keep up with it.While feeling satisfied, I slowly read the description of the Mana operation skill.And as soon as I finished reading the explanation, I raised the corners of my mouth.-With regards to mana operation, you have stepped into the realm of natural talent, and most of the restrictions related to mana management will be lifted.What this sentence meant was simple\u2014I can wield and perform mana operations like a person with great aptitude.Moreover, most of the restrictions related to mana operation are lifted, which means I can use mana the way I want to.Of course, there had to be a penalty that the Proficiency wouldn't rise at all if there was no independent realization, but that couldn't be helped.'Even if I don't get that independent realization, there'll be a way to increase my proficiency as I climb the tower.'Just like the 'Skill Proficiency Potion' acquired as a common reward for the trial of the 10th floor.It was more important to establish a foothold for growth based on the rewards of trials rather than talent.The higher the growth power, the more opportunities I'd be getting to raise my skill level.And it's the Tower of Trials that makes it possible.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Soon, I got up from my seat and began raising the mana in my body.As stated in the mana operation skill, I had now been freed from most of the restrictions related to mana operation.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksWhich means?'It would mean that in terms of mana abilities, my skill would be in a different league.'It didn't take that long to confirm that fact.The moment after concentrating the mana into my right foot and stomping it.Slaaaaaam\u2026\u2026..!!The wind pressure created at the point of impact was so intense that it left a graze on my cheek.It was completely different from the simple strengthening of the body through the mana circuit before.'It'd be safe to assume that my physical ability has increased several times.'It was then\u2014\u300c Skill 'Mana Operation ()' activated, and the mana circuit inside the body is greatly affected. \u300d\u300c Skill 'Mana Circuit (D)' is forcibly upgraded by the skill 'Mana Operation ()'. \u300dThe skill rank of the mana circuit changed as its Proficiency rose significantly due to Mana Operation.Due to the growth of the skill level, the mana circuit inside the body also started to grow rapidly.Crunch\u2014!As the branch of the mana circuit multiplied and became bigger, it felt like the path through which the mana flows was getting wider.And after a while, the pain subsided, and a message appeared in front of my eyes.\u300c The rank of skill 'Mana Circuit (D)' has been forcibly adjusted to C+. \u300dI felt dazed looking at the skill level that had risen several ranks at once.\u201c\u2026This is different from what I expected.\u201dKilling two birds with one stone.In fact, I didn't even think about the increase in the performance of the mana circuit, but the skill rank was forcibly increased through the mana operation.'Then maybe?'As a result, I immediately started to activate other skills through mana operation one by one.Most of the skills can't be used unless the caster's capability matches the condition.Therefore there's this thing called skill aptitude which exists, and the method of acquiring the skill is defined.'Of course, thanks to the Tower of Trials, you could learn skills even by ignoring the skill aptitude, though.'If you don't directly use an ability that's comparable to the effect of the skill once, you'll never be able to acquire the skill.On the other hand, what if you didn't know how to use the ability of that certain skill, but still acquired the skill?It was simple.Just like how the mana circuit within the body grew as the rank of the mana circuit increased.I'd be able to use the skills I had in stronger abilities that match my current self.Therefore, it was a little difficult, but I was able to activate the skills once by using mana operations one after another.\u300c Skill 'Triple Laceration ()'s proficiency is increased by 8% by the skill 'Mana Operation ()'. \u300dI made the skill effect to work to activate the mana explosively every time I swung the sword.\u300c Skill 'Instant acceleration(C-)' is forcibly upgraded by the skill 'Mana Operation ()'. \u300d\u300c The rank of skill 'Instant acceleration (C-)' has been forcibly adjusted to B. \u300dI upgraded Instant Acceleration, which made my whole body light as a temporary body strengthening.\u300c Skill 'Counter Shield (B-)'s proficiency is increased by 7% by the skill 'Mana Operation ()'. \u300dBased on the skill composition, I condensed the mana on the outside and reproduced it by myself.Through that process, I raised my skill proficiencies and even their ranks.\u201cMy speed of growth is really insane.\u201dI couldn't help but laugh at my skills which should've taken months to rank up.However, I was quite surprised that I could easily bring out the effects of skills by myself.'I thought it'd be quite difficult to bring out its effect without using a skill.'Since I had acquired the skills without any aptitude at all, it was an attempt with a thought in my mind that I could manifest them only in theory, and I may not be able to pull it off at all.But I couldn't help but be surprised looking at the skills growing smoothly.Although I soon figured out where the cause of this smooth activation laid.'It's probably because of that rank skill, Mana Operation.'To think that there was this kind of ability that said most of the restrictions related to mana operations are lifted.As I was laughing in vain because of this, two administrators who were paying attention to me sent me a message.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-Blooded Monarch' once again marvels at the growth potential of the contractor. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' praises your marvelous idea. \u300dBoth of them were surprised as though they were looking at me, activating the skills, but\u2026In fact, even if I knew how the skill worked, my original self wouldn't have been able to bring out the skills.'I was just able to somehow cause the skills to change thanks to the Mana Operation skill.'Knowing that, I felt my guilty conscience prick a little, but I tried my best to ignore that feeling and continued the confirmation.However\u2026The skill didn't activate as easily as before.Because the ability I was trying to activate right now was 'Sword Ki'.It was to raise the skill proficiency of the Lightning Sword Ki, but it wasn't easy to bring out the effects of power.For some reason, even if I tried to follow the skill diagram like when I was activating Triple Laceration, I couldn't.The Triple Laceration skill simply needed the mana placed on the sword to be activated when it was striking the enemy.So, I thought it would work if I placed weaker mana into the blade of the sword compared to Triple Laceration and covered it up with a coating.But that wasn't it.\u201cIt's lacking.\u201dThe Lightning Sword Ki didn't activate, perhaps because there was no sense that the sword felt like my own body.'How come?'I thought I had placed enough mana on the sword, and the coating was perfect.But ultimately, I couldn't bring out a Sword Ki with high lethality power like the Sword Master's Ki power.At that, I constantly asked questions and closed my eyes while holding my sword firmly.Let's assume that the Sword Ki is activated under the premise that the Sword Ki can only be used when I recognize the sword as my body.Then, why did I have to recognize the sword as a body and apply mana to it to bring out Sword Ki?To make a magical blade, just applying mana would be enough.But\u2026'That's not a Sword Ki.'Moreover, it doesn't maintain a strong power like Sword Ki at all times.Even though it uses lower mana than Triple Laceration, it produces a strength on par with it.Mana coating could never keep up with the ability of Sword Ki.As I was contemplating with my eyes closed on the reason why, at some point, a thought came to my mind.When I used the mana operation earlier, my physical ability improved several times when I condensed mana on my right foot.'Perhaps it's a similar principle to that?'If it stops at the level of coating, even if I condense mana on my right foot like a while ago, that kind of power won't come out.Only the external solidity would become stronger and stop at the point where the body won't take much damage.So I thought that no matter how much mana I put on, it wouldn't become like a Sword Ki.Then what makes a sword like a body and allows us to use it like a body?It's mana.'Then how can I use that mana to make the sword feel like my body?'It was simple.Connect the sword and myself with the feeling of connection rather than an infusion of mana that was no different from the body.Instead of inserting mana and disconnecting the connection, keep the line after inserting the mana.Just like putting your left-hand fingers and right-hand fingers together\u2026In this way, I could seize the sword with my mana and strengthen the sword's ability from the inside.And then\u2026\u300c Instead of using the Sword Ki through skills and powers, you used Sword Ki through independent realization. \u300d\u300c The Tower of Trials compliments Han SungYeun, the first challenger on earth dimension to use Sword Ki by themselves. \u300dThe moment I opened my eyes, there was a sword emitting a splendid beam of light that was completely different from before.\u300c'Body and Sword as One' achievement unlocked. \u300d\u300c Because the user already owns the power 'Sword Ki Master', an alternate reward will be given instead of the power. \u300d\u300c The power 'Sword Ki Master' is now wholly owned by the challenger, Han Sungyeun.\u300d\u300c The mana cost penalty of 'Sword Ki Master' will now disappear. \u300dIt was indeed a perfect Sword Ki.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I wonder how many times the Tower praised me?I was only praised after I was called to the Tower, and after winning a fierce battle against the Orcs.I couldn't even remember the Tower of Trials praising me after that.While enjoying the praise I had received after such a long time, I quickly put away the Sword Ki and stopped.I'd finished everything that needed to be done.Therefore\u2014\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' invites you to the administrator territory. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' invites you to the admini\u2026 \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' invites you to\u2026 \u300dThere was no need to hesitate further.As I accepted the White Crane Sword Saint's invitation, moving to the administrator's area happened literally within the blink of an eye.\u300cYou're being teleported to the administrator territory as you've accepted the invitation.\u300d\u300c You have entered the forest. \u300dThe moment I blinked my eyes, at the same time, a system message popped up.The landscape around me was changed, and a mansion with a small pond in the middle of a bamboo forest caught my attention.I was intrigued for a while by the atmosphere reminiscent of ancient China, but\u2026Apart from the intrigue, it didn't mean that I was surprised.Just like the Iron-Blooded Monarch, this territory is also nothing but an area allocated to the White Crane Sword Saint, after all.Now, rather than this territory itself, my interest was focused on the White Crane Sword Saint, who was named as the owner of this realm.Judging by the title used as an administrator, I thought maybe she was an old person like Baek Sunhak.It was pretty plausible when I recalled the content that had been delivered to me through system messages.\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' eagerly awaits your visit. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' hopes that you had no change of heart. \u300dHowever, guessing the identity of White Crane Sword Saint was cut off by a message that soon came up.It looked like an elderly person living alone was anxious that their grandson, who didn't visit for a long time, would leave, but\u2026Contrary to the message of White Crane Sword Saint emitting anxiousness, I had no intention of taking a step back now.\u201cNo worries. I have no intention of beating around the bush anymore.\u201dI just reaffirmed and became certain of the effectiveness of the Sword Ki through the independent realization.Clearly, administrator White Crane Sword Saint was someone who'd give me benefits rather than cause a loss.An administrator from Murim could bring me great benefits in terms of combat power.Therefore\u2014Having come this far meant that there was no option to turn back.I immediately moved forward, held the doorknob of the Chinese-style mansion, and went in.Then\u2014\u201c\u2026Finally, you've come this far.\u201dI could see a white-haired woman standing on the floor overlooking a small pond beyond it.She soon turned her head and smiled at me, putting the sword on her lap.And then\u2026\u201cI have been waiting for a challenger like you to appear for a really long time.\u201dSoon I opened my eyes widely as I saw her faint smile while she fluttered her white hair.Originally, I speculated that the White Crane Sword Saint would be an old man with a gentle impression, but\u2026Despite that speculation, White Crane Sword Saint wasn't an old man, nor even a man.\u201cNice to meet you. I'm administrator White Crane Sword Saint.\u201dThe White Crane Sword Saint was a beautiful young lady with an elegant impression.At first, I thought I wouldn't be so bewildered when I met the White Crane Sword Saint.But that was a complete misjudgment.The identity of the White Crane Sword Saint was completely different from what I had imagined.A fluttering white martial arts uniform and fine, white hair showed that the White Crane Sword Saint was an old person.But on the contrary, I was bewildered because wherever I looked at her body, she only looked like an adult who had just turned 20 years old.Could all administrators keep their bodies young like this?'It seems that the welfare of the tower is quite formidable even though they died and became subordinate to the tower.'To think that they give you a body that never gets old, never gets sick, and as well as an individual territory.I thought that it seemed they have even better welfare than the level of the Earth.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]It was then\u2014\u201c\u2026What's wrong? Is there any problem?\u201dThe White Crane Sword Saint tilted her head as she looked at me, standing still.Only then I stopped thinking about her and opened my mouth.It's because it's not good to stand around thinking about things while you have an important trade opponent in front of you.\u201c\u2026I was just amazed to see the administrator that I only knew through messages.\u201dTo be precise, I was surprised by the appearance of the White Crane Sword Saint, which was completely different from what I thought.\u201cAhaha\u2026 you might feel that way, too.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksWhite Crane Sword Saint smiled a little and agreed with me.Then she tapped the seat next to her with her palm while looking at me.\u201cIt'd be difficult if you just stand there and talk. Please come over here.\u201d\u201c\u2026That's true. Excuse me then.\u201dI replied to her call briefly and quietly sat down next to her.I could only then understand why she was sitting on the floor instead of on a chair.It was refreshing.The wind flowing through the forest reached the floor, delivering fresh air.And in a small pond seen over the open floor, fish were swimming freely under the lotus flowers.It felt like I was gradually being inspired just by looking at it.The White Crane Sword Saint spoke to me as I stared blankly at the scene.\u201cIt feels good, doesn't it?\u201dShe smiled as she hugged her fluttering martial arts uniform down to her ankles, along with her knees.\u201cI've always been here, watching you.\u201d\u201c\u2026Since when?\u201d\u201cSince you started the duel of life and death between Baek Sunhak on the 9th floor.\u201d\u201cSo you've been watching me since the time when trial spectating became possible.\u201dMoreover, that was the time when the White Crane Sword Saint sponsored me a power.Which meant that after seeing me achieve victory in the duel with Baek Sunhak, she immediately sponsored me.\u201cDidn't you think it was a waste to sponsor a power to a challenger that you'd only seen once?\u201dAt those words, White Crane Sword Saint shook her head with a cold face.\u201cIt wasn't a waste at all. You really need to know your worth.\u201d\u201cGreat Elder Baek Sunhak was a swordsman who used to be called quite a strong man in Murim, even though he didn't reach the level of Sword Ki Supreme.\u201d\u201cEven though he lost most of the strength he had after entering the Tower of Trials, defeating such a challenger is enough to call it an achievement.\u201dShe blabbered as though it was something great, but I couldn't really accept her words.Baek Sunhak must've been much stronger than me at the time when he hadn't entered the Tower.And that fact wouldn't have really changed even before the floor intrusion penalty weakened him.It was then that I was about to dismiss the topic, saying I won out of luck.I couldn't help but be shocked with my eyes wide open at the words of the White Crane Sword Saint that followed soon after.Because\u2026\u201cYou don't have to deny it, because it's from me, who once signed a contract with Baek Sunhak.\u201dIt was because the truth that I couldn't have imagined was revealed with her words.The atmosphere became heavy in an instant.I had already noticed that White Crane Sword Saint was an administrator from Murim.However, it was my first time knowing that she was the administrator who had signed a contract with Baek Sunhak.I wondered if she had a big grudge or something against me, but\u2026She dismissed it as though she realized that I was having such thoughts.\u201cI didn't have a good relationship with Baek Sunhak.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cHe was just a good challenger for me to earn points even though he didn't have any growth potential.\u201d\u201cI had never met him in person. He knew it too, but he stayed still since he wanted my powers.\u201dAfter saying that, the White Crane Sword Saint said with lamentation as though she felt bitter.\u201cI have signed many contracts with challengers, but I have never called a challenger here so far.\u201dFrom those words, I could tell that she had spent many years by herself.\u201cUntil I saw you through Baek Sunhak.\u201dBefore I knew it, the eyes of the White Crane Sword Saint were sending me an intangible pressure with seriousness.\u201cYou've probably expected it to some extent, but I'll tell you clearly.\u201dAt that, I narrowed my eyes and looked at her.\u201cPlease sign the [Additional Contract] that was formed along with the expansion of the Tower system this time.\u201dI opened my mouth while keeping my expressionless face at her suggestion.\u201cWhat exactly are the advantages I can get from doing that?\u201d\u201cI can make you a disciple of the administrator White Crane Sword Saint.\u201d\u201c\u2026What would be good if I become White Crane Sword Saint's disciple exactly?\u201d\u201cIn the tower, a discipleship means a challenger with a special contract that each administrator can appoint only one person in his or her lifetime.\u201d\u201cWhen the discipleship contract is signed, the challenger who became a disciple can purchase all the powers possessed by the administrator.\u201d\u201cThen you mean that contracts that aren't discipleship contracts can't purchase all the powers?\u201d\u201cThe power of an administrator is an ability that can break nature. There are bound to be restrictions.\u201dIn short, it meant that if I became her disciple, I'd be able to buy all the powers of the White Crane Sword Saint.But if I didn't, I'd only be able to attain limited powers.I felt very lucky in this situation.The Iron-Blooded Monarch was the first contractor I made, and I was also the first challenger brought to the administrator's territory by the White Crane Sword Saint to make me her disciple.And it didn't stop there.'White Crane Sword Saint recommended me to be her disciple even though it's an additional contract.'The Tower of Trials specified that the [Additional Contract] is a contract that can run out at any time.However, she gave me the position of a disciple, which can only be given once in a lifetime as an administrator.I wondered if there could ever be any situation that would be good for me, but ironically, my doubts arose because of that.\u201cWhy are you even offering me the seat of a disciple?\u201dI wondered what the White Crane Sword Saint expected from me that she was even willing to give me the seat of disciple even though it was just an additional contract?I couldn't hold back my curiosity about it, and she easily answered right away.\u201cI just chose you to make my Earnest Wish come true, just like that woman.\u201dAs though there was nothing to hide, White Crane Sword Saint said quietly while looking at the pond.\u201cI need the sharpest Sword than anyone else. The best Sword that will never be broken and will never be dulled.\u201dSword.\u201cYou have the potential to be sharper than any other sword I've ever seen.\u201dWhite Crane Sword Saint said that she chose me because she thought that I'd become a sharper sword than anyone else.Then, where did she want to wield that Sword, which is me?\u201cYou obtain the sword because you have somewhere to wield it.\u201d\u201cThen what is that Earnest Wish of yours?\u201dBut she tilted her head as if she didn't understand what I was saying.Then she approached me, dragging her fluttering martial arts uniform to the floor, and opened her eyes wide like a rabbit.\u201cHave you not heard from that woman what the Earnest Wish is?\u201dHearing her say that woman, she seemed to know the Iron-Blooded Monarch, so I wanted to ask her if she knew her.But rather than the relationship between the two of them, I focused on her words, asking if I didn't know what Earnest Wish is.\u201cI've only heard that she can't tell me about the Earnest Wish yet.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026? She hasn't told her disciple about the Earnest Wish yet?\u201d\u201c\u2026Whatever. It's something I can tell if she hasn't told you.\u201dWhite Crane Sword Saint clenched the fluttering martial arts uniform with both hands and opened her mouth as though she was sighing.\u201cEarnest Wish isn't a personal wish of an administrator without compensation for you.\u201dAnd\u2014Earnest Wish is a right that Tower bestowed on the administrator. Like the trial of the Tower, the administrator can give the challenger a trial. If they accomplish it, the challenger gets a reward.I couldn't help but open my eyes wide as she continued speaking.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It's much deserved.\u201cDo you know why the administrators are subordinated to the tower even though we all died once?\u201d\u201cIt must be because you don't want to die. No one wants to die.\u201d\u201cThere must be some administrators like that. But we didn't become subordinated to the Tower because we feared death.\u201dAs if sinking into the abyss, the eyes of the White Crane Sword Saint has become endlessly serious.\u201cWe have a wish that needs to be granted no matter what.\u201d\u201cAn Earnest Wish is fulfilled on behalf of us through the disciple.\u201d\u201cBut you mentioned that the Earnest Wish is a trial. Then it'd be meaningless.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think so?\u201d\u201cBecause the trial is the stage of growth that the Tower prepared for the challengers, obviously.\u201dTrials existed only to grow the challenger.Literally, it was about giving the challengers trials and making them stronger when they endure them.I didn't think that overcoming the trial would solve the administrator's emotional baggage.\u201cSince I don't think I've ever seen anything that could grant the administrator's wish out of the trials I've seen so far.\u201d\u201c\u2026You're correct. Right. A trial is just a reenactment of a situation, and it's just a stage for the challengers to grow.\u201d\u201cThen wouldn't that make it meaningle\u2014\u201d\u201cBut it's worth it in terms of achieving that recreated situation.\u201dWhite Crane Sword Saint looked at me vacantly and slowly continued her words.\u201cMost of the administrators' Earnest Wishes come from their past regrets.\u201d\u201cSome may not, but most are. But with the passage of time, no one can change the history of the past.\u201d\u201cThat's right. Unless you become a God or something.\u201d\u201cBut if you can grant the Earnest Wish, it's possible to change the past. By intervening in my past in the form of a trial to give it a change.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dAt what White Crane Sword Saint said, I looked at her blankly while blinking my eyes.Can you change the past?\u201cThere's no way such nonsense would be possible.\u201d\u201cYou should know it since you've gone through the Tower of Trials so far. Whether what I'm saying is true or not.\u201dShe was right.The Tower of Trials had out-of-standard abilities and brought more serious changes than the Great Calamity.Therefore I, who had a disastrous failure and should've given up my dream to become a hunter, was able to reach this point.It wasn't surprising that the Tower could change the past.\u201cI'm not sure about the other administrators, but I want to change my past.\u201dShe said in a gloomy tone that didn't suit her.\u201cBut just because you fulfill the Earnest Wish, it doesn't mean that the past will change immediately.\u201d\u201cConditions are added depending on how serious the administrator's Earnest Wish is.\u201d\u201cThen it must be the disciple challenger who fulfills that condition.\u201dIf the administrator could resolve the necessary condition independently, there would be no restriction on needing a disciple to resolve their Earnest Wish for them.'It must be difficult since the challenger has to fulfill that condition.'And the White Crane Sword Saint immediately agreed as though what I had said was correct.\u201cYou're right. A challenger with discipleship must fulfill the conditions on behalf of the administrator.\u201dAs expected, it was a system in which the challenger had to complete additional conditions, not the administrator.\u201cThere are basically two conditions that a challenger must fulfill.\u201dThe White Crane Sword Saint slowly extended her index finger and said.\u201cFirst of all, there's a certain number of floors you have to climb as a condition.\u201dThen, soon she stretched out her middle finger and continued talking with her two fingers up.\u201cSecondly, there's a condition that the difficulty of all personal trials will be harder when you get past the 20th floor.\u201dI opened my mouth at those words while feeling my body stiffen up.\u201c\u2026Can I ask you one thing?\u201dChanging the past is basically a miracle that defies the flow of time.It meant that the number of floors that I had to climb and every personal trial after the 20th floor would be ridiculously intensified.Then, how many times would I have to repeat those insane trials before achieving the Earnest Wish of the White Crane Sword Saint?I felt uncomfortable holding on to that question, so I decided to ask the question right away.\u201cHow far do I have to climb up to grant your Earnest Wish?\u201dWhite Crane Sword Saint smiled bitterly at that question, then scratched her cheek and turned away to avoid my gaze.\u201cThat's\u2026 uhm, I believe the waiting room on the final floor of the Tower of Trials should be enough?\u201dFinal floor.I'd figured out that the goal I had to reach in order to turn the administrator's Earnest Wish into reality was the top of the Tower, but\u2026Just talking about the results, in the end, I accepted the proposal of White Crane Sword Saint without being able to turn it down.\u300c Contract has been made.\u300d\u201cSplendid choice! You definitely won't regret this!\u201dAt the same time, the system message informed me that I had become a contractor of White Crane Sword Saint\u2026She smiled brightly, grabbed my right hand with both hands, and shook it.It wasn't really a bad sight because she had the appearance of a short maidenlike girl; it feels like a lie that she once challenged to the Tower as a challenger.However, even if it was a decision for growth, hearing that I had to reach the final floor made my shoulders heavy.It didn't change the fact that I was responsible for climbing up to the final floor.Of course-.\u300c You have been recognized as the true disciple of Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint'. \u300d\u300c As a perk of the discipleship, the power and skill efficiency based on the Murim dimension is increased by 10%'. \u300d\u300cAs a perk of the discipleship, the power and skill efficiency based on the Murim dimension is increased by 10%'. \u300d\u300c As a perk of the discipleship, mana is increased by +3. \u300d\u300c Currently, challenger Han Sungyeun has been recognized as a disciple by two administrators. \u300d\u300c As a perk of dual discipleship, agility is increased by +3. \u300d\u201cI don't think the day will come when I'll regret this choice.\u201dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksBe that as it may, too many rewards were given to me to regret this contract.It was unlike the time with Iron-Blooded Monarch, since I wasn't her first contractor so mana had only increased by +3, but\u2014The effect of increasing the efficiency of Power and skill of the Murim dimension by 10% as a perk for discipleship couldn't be underestimated.As a matter of fact, my Sword Ki became stronger as I reached the level of the Body and Sword as One.Adding on to that, the 10% increase in the efficiency of Sword Ki was no less than an increase in combat power.It wasn't just that.Perhaps the Tower thought of it in a good light that I was designated as a disciple of two administrators?When the message popped up that the agility stat increased by 3, I had no regret left.\u201cI'm glad that you think you won't regret it.\u201dWhite Crane Sword Saint smiled innocently and then waved her hand to say goodbye.\u201cI'll look forward to the trial of the 11th floor.\u201d\u300c Moving to the 11th waiting room. \u300dInstead of a peaceful forest, I returned to the desolate waiting room.I wanted to take a rest since I ended my additional contracts and all, but\u2026I suppressed my fatigue and immediately opened an exclusive contract marketplace.\u300c Contract Exclusive Marketplace \u300d\u300c SP \u2013 4,000 \u300d\u300c Category: Skill \u300d\u300c Category: Power \u300d\u300c Category: Item \u300d\u300c Contractor: Iron-Blooded Monarch as well as White Crane Sword Saint \u300d\u300c Remarks: The first contractor of the administrator 'Iron-Blooded Monarch' and the disciple of the administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' \u300dI could see the changes right away.In addition to the 4,000 SP obtained by breaking through the 10th floor trial, the White Crane Sword Saint had been added to the description of the contractor and remarks.To be honest, I wanted to be immersed in the feeling that I had grown this much, but my body moved like a machine.\u300c Category: Power \u300dIt was then that I called out the list of powers by pressing the Power category.\u300cPlease select a list of powers to view.\u300d\u300c 1. Iron-Blooded Monarch \u300d\u300c 2. White Crane Sword Saint \u300d\u300c 3. Sponsored Power \u300d\u201c\u2026Does this mean that the list of powers has grown enough to have a classification now?\u201dPreviously, the Power list was uncategorized, but now it was clear that the Power list was separate for each administrator.I'd been thinking that it'd be cumbersome to check the list of powers if it's mixed up, but it was a good change.\u300c Power List 'White Crane Sword Saint' has been selected \u300d\u300c Category: Power (White Crane Sword Saint) \u300d\u300c List (1/3) \u300d\u300c Power: Power Combination () \u300d\u300c Power: Desire for battle () \u300d\u300c Power: Path of Ghostblade (S) \u300dI let out a laugh seeing that S rank powers were clearly stated on the list from the start.I was totally convinced that the choice I made was the way to the final floor of the Tower.\u300c (!) You can only view the powers on the list (1/3). \u300d\u300c (!) You can view the list of powers (2/3) starting from the waiting room on the 20th floor. \u300dOf course, the second power page hadn't been opened yet, just like the Iron-Blooded Monarch's was.As always, nothing was unlocked, so I silently looked at the powers that were there.\u300c Power: Power Combination () \u300d\u300c Price : 5,000 SP \u300d\u300c Explanation: It's a power that embodies the footsteps of White Crane Sword Saint, combining all of her skills for decision and focus from when she was a challenger. You can develop new powers by combining powers that you currently have, or you can consume a power to raise the rank of the existing Power. \u300dStarting with the ability that just looked like a power version of skill combination.\u300c Power: Desire for battle () \u300d\u300cPrice : 7,500 SP\u300d\u300c Explanation: The desire for battle is the origin of the species for predators. It's a power that is often obtained by those who only see life as a battle. When fighting an opponent stronger than you, the increasing rate of all skill proficiency increases by up to 300%, and it makes it easier for you to feel the joy of battle. \u300dI also looked at an absurd power that aids your growth.\u300c Power: Path of Ghostblade (S) \u300d\u300c Price : 10,000 SP \u300d\u300c Explanation: It's a power often obtained by those who wield swords that fall into the contradiction of living in order to become strong instead of becoming strong to live. When it comes to swords, you can develop your own skills, and it becomes easier to embody a self-realization. \u300dFinally, the first S rank power is listed in the power list.All the powers were astonishingly good, but there was nothing I could buy.'The minimum requirement for the power of the White Crane Sword Saint is high.'Since there wasn't a power that I could purchase right away, I couldn't help but feel like these were just a pipe dream.But regardless, these powers were abilities that I'd eventually acquire if I completed the trials a few more times.Instead of feeling disappointed, I immediately changed the list of powers and browsed the sponsored Power.\u300c Power: Wings of Steel (C+) \u300d\u300c Price: 1,500 SP \u300d\u300c Explanation: The Power to create steel wings with mana. High-speed flight will be possible through the wings of steel generated by mana. At this time, it is necessary to continuously inject mana to maintain the wings, and when the mana is insufficient, the wings will automatically be removed.\u300dIt was none other than to buy a Power that made air combat possible.I thought I could buy the Power of the Iron-Blooded Monarch, but I didn't.'I need to choose the power that will be useful without using as much SP as possible.'As expected from an administrator of the Murim dimension, all of the powers of White Crane Sword Saint were excellent.Therefore it'd be better to save SP as much as I can and purchase at least one of her powers after breaking through the 11th floor.As I reached a conclusion, there was nothing to hesitate about.\u300c You've purchased the 'Power: Wings of Steel (C+)' \u300d\u300c 1,500 SP will be deducted. \u300dAt the same time, I purchased the Wings of steel, and I decided to check the exact abilities of this Power.\u201cWings of Steel.\u201dIt was then\u2014\u300c Activating Power, 'Wings of Steel'. \u300dWooosh!I felt something sharp coming out of my back, and then a new sensation arose.It was the sensation of the wings on my back.I reached out, touched behind my back in bewilderment, and immediately felt the wings.I could even understand that the skin and the Wings of Steel were naturally connected.\u201cHuh, to think that it's completely connected to the back.\u201dIt was a power sponsored by the Tower's administrator, so I thought it was composed of magical fundamentals.But it wasn't anything like that, and it looked like I could fly just by putting the mana into the wings that protruded from my back.My body immediately floated into the air as I injected mana into the steel wings and fluttered them.Surprisingly, it was easy to float in the air, and there was no need to flap the wings that much because it flew by magic.I also wanted to see how much I could fly or move quickly, but the waiting room was too small for that.\u201cI guess I can't help it.\u201dIn the end, I had no choice but to deactivate the Wings of Steel and descend to the ground.\u300c Deactivating Power, 'Wings of Steel'. \u300dIt was difficult to check the Wings of Steel's capability in this place.\u201cThen I'll have to change the stage.\u201dI immediately opened the shop window and purchased the same lowest-grade return stone as before.\u300c You've purchased a Return Stone (F+). \u300dI had broken through more trials than the initial plan and completed an additional contract with the administrator.Therefore\u2026Now, it was time for me to be active on Earth, not the Tower.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The cause lies elsewhere.This is because only one hunter had surpassed rank in Japan.And even that one person was clearing a dungeon right now, trying to get some useful equipment.Because of that, rank hunters from all over Japan, including Oozuchi Kunishi, gathered in Shinjuku.To cope with this situation where the only S-rank hunter in Japan was absent.As such, Oozuchi Kunishi had no choice but to be dissatisfied.'If it were Korea or the U.S, instead of gathering up all rank hunters like this, they would've called an S-rank hunter and dealt with it.'As he recalled that fact again, Oozuchi Kunishi felt a sense of displeasure creeping up his body.Perhaps the other hunters around him were no different, so lamentations also poured out from their mouths.\u201cFucking hell! It's pissing me off. Why the hell are gates breaking out so much in Japan when there aren't enough hunters?\u201d\u201cIf they're gonna shove us around like this, they need to at least give us a high pay. But they're an awful miser.\u201d\u201cWhatever, fine. Has the Japan hunter association ever done the right thing? It's a fucked up country, you see.\u201dThey were all like dogs to Shinjuku with poor pay.Just by the Japanese government's word that all hunters must obey the laws of the country.So it was inevitable that complaints were breaking loose.But that was also just for a while.Whirrr!The moment soon came when a blue rift started to appear in the middle of the streets of Shinjuku.\u201cThis fucking son of a\u2026! It's a rift! Prepare for battle!\u201dHunters grumbling on the street changed their spirit and prepared for battle.Even if they were all dissatisfied with the situation, they were veteran hunters who had enough strength and gained enough combat experience to climb up to an rank hunter.As such, the hunters, including Oozuchi Kunishi, quickly straightened their posture and glared at the gate but\u2014\u201c\u2026What?\u201dNo matter how hard they stared at the blue rift, no monster came out.Originally, at least a monster at the dungeon's entrance should appear if a gate is freshly generated.Even more so in the case of a high-ranked and sudden gate like this one.But not a single monster, even an ant, was coming out of it?\u201cHey, this seems a bit stra\u2026\u201dIt was that moment when Oozuchi Kinishi opened his mouth, he felt a deep sense of oddness.\u201c\u2014Why are there so many bugs swarming around?\u201dA vigorous sound was heard in his ear as though speaking to Heaven and Earth from beyond the gate.Soon, a young man in a blue martial arts uniform walked out of the gate where nothing had appeared.The dragon pattern is engraved with gold thread on the blue martial arts uniform or the curved sword on his right waist.And a neatly tied ponytail at his back hinted that this young man isn't just an ordinary person.The young man looked at Oozuchi Kunishi as though he were looking at a bug.Then he scratched his chin with his left hand and frowned as if he couldn't understand.\u201cDidn't I ask you just now? Why are there so many bugs swarming around?\u201dWas it because of his absurdly arrogant tone, as if he was really talking to a bug?The people who couldn't even speak because they were bewildered by the fact that a person came out of the gate soon came to their senses and made dumbfounded faces.And soon after, the hunter behind Oozuchi Kunishi frowned and shouted in an angry voice.\u201c\u2026Huh? What the hell do you mean? Hey, stop blabbering nonsense and explain how you came ou\u2014.\u201dAnd those were the last words of that hunter.Crush!Oozuchi Kunishi recognized the sound of something being crushed at the same time as some hot liquid was getting on his back.It didn't take long for him to figure out that it was the blood splattered from the crushed head of the hunter who was just talking.Tremble\u2026Just like a watercolor dripping into a glass of water slowly spreading its color.Starting from the blood-soaked back, the whole body began to tremble like an aspen leaf.Oozuchi Kunishi immediately understood why.Because this feeling was a familiar thing to a hunter who was thrown around in the dangerous places of the dungeon.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Fear.It was the emotion felt by the prey in front of an infinitely powerful enemy.Usually, a prey in front of a predator like this will show a total of three behaviors.\u201cYou son of a bitch, how dare you kill Shimura\u2026! I won't forgive y\u2026!\u201dThe first is to deny the feeling of fear and rush toward the predator.Crush!\u201cNo way\u2026! I-I don't want to die! S-Save m\u2026!The second is to run away from the predator, dominated by the emotion of fear.Crush!The third is to give up their lives because they know how powerful a predator is.\u201cIt's finally quiet now that there's only one left.\u201dOozuchi Kunishi was the third among them.Now he wasn't just trembling, but also chattering his teeth, showing extreme fear.He couldn't help it.The young man who appeared before him instantly killed all the hunters behind Oozuchi Kunishi.Oozuchi Kunishi had never seen the young man move.He couldn't figure out why the hunter standing behind him had his head crushed to death.He may have been using the sword that was on his waist, or he might have killed them through another skill.He just then noticed the sounds of corpses falling behind his back.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksSix of the seven rank hunters gathered in Shinjuku were all killed within a few minutes.\u201cNow that there's only one bug left, I shall ask you politely, too.\u201dThe young man smiled softly, as though he had changed his mind and showed mercy.\u201cDeliver this message to the challenger, Han Sungyeun.\u201dAnd so, the predator in human form, that you could never resist, demanded of Oozuchi Kunishi\u2014\u201cThat the Sword Dragon of the Blue Sky, Namgung Hyuk has come to avenge Baek Sunhak.\u201dTo bring new prey.After purchasing the Return Stone, I immediately took out a large number of items from my inventory.I had to dispose of the items stolen by killing Kim Seungjun in the trial on the 10th floor.In addition to that, It was necessary to confirm the ability of some newly acquired items.As such, I activated the Return Stone with all the items to dispose of and items to confirm the abilities of.And then\u2026In the blink of an eye, I wasn't in the waiting room of the Tower, but in a different place.\u300c You have turned to the residence of the challenger, Han Sungyeun. \u300dIt was none other than the studio apartment I lived in.\u201cI'm finally back.\u201dThis was already the third return, so the feeling of returning wasn't new.I got up from the bed and smiled bitterly at the items scattered around me.I was lost as to where to start and how to organize these as I looked at dozens of items.\u201cIt's gonna take some time to clean this up.\u201dOriginally, instead of just disposing of the items, I'd have to look at the performance of the item and find out the marketplace, but\u2014Those were the days when I was a hunter with no affiliation, and now I'm a person that enjoys a high level of freedom in a guild while receiving all the benefits.It meant that the time when I had to deal with everything by myself was over.'I guess I can contact Lee Hayeon and ask her to prepare for disposal of the items in bulk'I looked for my smartphone in the scattered pile of items and powered it on.And as soon as the smartphone screen turned on, I couldn't help but be shocked.Because\u2014[132 Missed calls.][87 Messages.]Because the smartphone informed me that there were countless calls while I was away.\u201cWhat is this now\u2026\u201dI frowned and quickly checked the person who called or texted.And soon, I immediately figured out who was looking for me.\u201cLee Hayeon?\u201dThere were phone numbers that I couldn't recognize, but most of them were filled with Lee Hayeon contacting me.Moreover, it was a call that started just yesterday.In other words, it means that something urgent enough to find me happened in that short time.So I quickly started checking the text that Lee Hayeon had sent.[Lee Hayeon: Sungyeun-ssi, are you still in the Tower?][Lee Hayeon: The Hunter Association has ordered all the challengers on the Hard difficulty to gather up.][Lee Hayeon: Almost all guilds are forcibly sending out challengers who have signed a contract.][Lee Hayeon: If you don't gather, you may be subject to a violation of the law, so I think it'd be better for Sungyeun-ssi to come as well.]The Hunter Association was gathering all the challengers of Hard difficulty?It was difficult to understand, but as soon as I read the text below, I could recognize the seriousness of the situation.[Lee Hayeon: \u2026Please contact me as soon as possible if you come back from the Tower. It's really urgent. ][Lee Hayeon: It's something related to a challenger from another world, but the content is being kept confidential.][Lee Hayeon: It seems like something big happened in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo, Japan.]Looks like an incident related to a challenger from another world has occurred.However, the challengers of another world were the ones who mainly did floor invasion inside the Tower.And what did they have to do with the Shinjuku ward in Tokyo, Japan?The moment I had my doubts, I felt a ray of light passing through my head.\u201cIs it because the dimension shifting function has been activated?\u201dI recalled the message that said the system had been expanded as I arrived at the waiting room on the 11th floor.\u2013 'Dimension Shifting' is being added to the marketplace category.-Interdimensional movement is now possible.That was it.Interdimensional movement wasn't necessarily just from Earth to another dimension.It meant that even someone from a world such as Ares, Murim, or Callian could now come to Earth.As soon as I speculated to that point, I immediately called Lee Hayeon without reading any further.Thankfully, I could hear Lee Hayeon's voice after the bell rang for a few seconds.-\u2026Han Sungyeun-ssi? Are you finally back?Her voice was full of fatigue, but it also conveyed a faint sense of relief.I answered her quickly.\u201cYes. I have just returned.\u201d-Sigh, I don't know where to start and how to explain this, but\u2026\u201cA challenger from another world must've appeared in Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan.\u201d-How did you figure that out? Even the Hunter Association said this was labeled as top secret!\u201cThat doesn't really matter. You can go straight to the main point.\u201d-\u2026R-Right. Cutting to the chase, the Hunter Association has gathered all the Hard difficulty challengers in Korea.\u201cWhy?\u201d-The Korean hunter association also decided to prepare for the incident in Shinjuku, and at the same time, the Japan Hunter Association asked the Korean side for help.-Currently, the challenger from another world is still staying in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo, Japan.\u201cDon't tell me\u2026 Are you saying that they couldn't kill the challenger from another world?\u201d-As you know, Japan is a country with weak hunters. There's only one S-rank hunter and 40 rank hunters.-But the challenger from another world who appeared in Shinjuku killed the six A rank hunters who were there in a matter of seconds, leaving only one alive.Therefore, the Japanese side requested help from outside due to the extreme difference in power.But there was something I couldn't understand.\u201cThen why did the association assemble the challengers when you can just send a Korean S-rank hunter?\u201d-That's the most important part. The challenger from another world who appeared in Shinjuku spared one class hunter and sent a message.That survivor was told to bring an unknown Korean challenger and said that he mentioned this.Lee Hayeon took a deep breath through the phone and continued her words.And I couldn't help but be so shocked that my heart almost stopped upon hearing her words.-Namgung Hyuk, The Sword Dragon of Blue Sky has come to avenge Baek Sunhak.-Sword Dragon of Blue Sky Namgung Hyuk.The Murim challenger whom the Iron-blooded Monarch warned me about came to Earth, not the Tower.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Did something happen?\u201dThen the taxi driver glanced at me and said with a face that he couldn't understand me.\u201d\u201cLooking at you going to the Seoul Hunter Association, aren't you a hunter summoned to the association?\u201d\u201cYou're right.\u201d\u201cBut you still haven't heard the news?\u201d\u201cThere's an uproar because a gate has been opened in Tokyo.\u201d\u201cWeren't you summoned for that too?\u201d\u201cYou're right, but what does that have to do with no one in the street?\u201dTo that, the taxi driver responded with a bit of annoyance, kicking his tongue.\u201cRumors are spreading that the Tower of Trials caused the gates in the Shinjuku ward of Tokyo these days.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d\u201cThey say that the gate that appeared in Tokyo was not a normal gate, but was caused by the Tower of Trials.\u201d\u201cThis isn't an officially confirmed matter, but seeing them gathering the challengers of Tower and hunters, I don't think it's entirely wrong either.\u201d\u201cSo that's why there are no people on the street. It can be dangerous if the gate opens unexpectedly like in Shinjuku ward.\u201dSo in short, it meant that the taxi driver driving a taxi like this right now was the weird one.And most of the citizens currently didn't even walk around the streets in fear of gates opening up like Shinjuku ward.I mean, who wouldn't be afraid when there are rumors that even ordinary people were also being dragged to the Tower, and the Tower was the cause of opening a terrible gate?'I thought the challenger from another world who appeared in Shinjuku Ward of Tokyo was top secret.'Although it's top secret, there seemed to be some information leaking to the public.Even the taxi driver casually used the term Tower of Trials.It meant that quite a bit of information about the Tower was revealed.'Did the ordinary people find out about the Tower of Trials in the meantime?'While I was climbing up to the 11th floor, society seemed to have undergone many changes.As if to prove it, the taxi driver poured out his words to me as though he was complaining.\u201cLet's say that normal people are being dragged to the Tower of Trials. That's still understandable, but to think that it's now affecting even the real world\u2026 Tsk, the world is coming to an end.\u201d[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Hearing those words, I looked outside the window without showing any reaction.I smiled bitterly at the words the taxi driver said, about the world falling apart and all.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks'The world was already ending since the gates and monsters began to appear.'Since when was it a normal world if people without talent could never become strong even if they risked their lives?Just because you didn't have any aptitudes, you couldn't acquire even a single skill even if you risked everything and trained.Despite losing my entire family, there was nothing I could do.I lived in such a world.I survived 7 years in such a world.I finally began to see the light in such a worldSo\u2026Just because the world was a little more twisted didn't mean it was declining.In the end, I always knew the kind that survived in such a turbulent world.Survival of the fittest.Those who couldn't adapt to the new world were slaughtered.And those who adapted to the new world\u2026 ruled as top predators.Recalling that fact calmly, I thought of Namgung Hyuk, who appeared in Shinjuku, Tokyo.I was just confused and scared right now, but I decided to consider that I'd be able to get over it soon.Just like when I was summoned to the Tower in the past.Now, it was time for me to adapt again.Upon arriving at the Seoul Hunter Association, I immediately contacted Lee Hayeon.Under the current circumstances of the challengers' summons, she was also included in the call.As a result, she was also in the Seoul Hunter Association in advance, so she came to pick me up.Lee Hayeon, who ran to the entrance of the Seoul Hunter Association, saw me and ran up to me with a smile, but\u2026\u201c\u2026Sungyeun-ssi, what's that outfit?\u201dSoon after, she looked at the clothes I was wearing and asked a question as though she couldn't understand them.\u201cWe don't have much time, so let's talk while going in.\u201dLee Hayeon immediately asked for an answer while guiding me to the inside of the Hunter Association, and I responded briefly.\u201cIt's a useful piece of equipment that I recently acquired from the Tower.\u201d\u201cNo, I'm asking why you're wearing it\u2026\u201d\u201cI heard that the gathering order for challengers has been dropped, but isn't it because they wanted to support the Japanese Hunter Association?\u201d\u201cThe Japanese Hunter Association also said that the challenger from another world mentioned the name of a Korean challenger, so we wouldn't be able to ignore the call for help.\u201dLooks like they don't know the details, as though they didn't hear the name of the Korean Challenger properly, though.But at least, since my name was mentioned, the Japanese Hunter Association would say that Korea was responsible for this.Then it was obvious that at least the Korean Hunter Association would have to support the Japanese Hunter Association by sorting the challengers, even in all conscience.\u201c\u2026You sure you were in the tower without knowing anything until now?\u201dLee Hayeon said so as if she couldn't believe it after hearing what I was saying.It was easy to guess since I knew a lot of things, but I really didn't know.\u201cIf I did, I wouldn't have been in the tower so relaxed.\u201dIf I had known that Namgung Hyuk had actually appeared in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo, I'd have looked for a solution right away.Anyhow, if you looked at the reason why he appeared in Tokyo's Shinjuku ward, it was because I killed Baek Sunhak in the Tower.\u201cAs you speculated, Sungyeun-ssi. The Korean Hunter Association seems to be planning to assign a few challengers and support the Japanese side.\u201d\u201cAre there no objections?\u201d\u201cOf course there is. There are quite a few coming out such as why we should apply to help Japan just because a Korean challenger was mentioned.\u201d\u201cSomeone also insists that we need to find the exact Korean Challenger that was mentioned, find out the truth, and hold them accountable\u2026 It's pretty troublesome.\u201d\u201cSo currently, they aren't sure about that Korean challenger mentioned by the challenger from another world?\u201d\u201cApparently, yeah. They said that the rank hunter that survived at the time didn't hear the name of the Korean challenger properly.\u201dWhile I was feeling a sense of bitterness at the news, that was a happy feature of a misfortune.Before I realized it, I found myself in the meeting room of the Seoul Hunter Association.Inside the meeting room, about ten people were seated in their respective seats.Perhaps because my sense of Ki also improved as the skill level of my mana circuit went up\u2026I noticed that those sitting inside the meeting room were quite skilled challengers.I sat down next to Lee Hayeon and told her the questions that came to my mind.\u201cLee Hayeon-ssi, isn't the summoning order for challengers given to all challengers on hard difficulty?\u201d\u201cYeah. So every challenger with difficulty stopped by the Hunter Association at least once.\u201d\u201cBut why are there only a few challengers in this meeting room?\u201d\u201cThat's because, in this meeting room, only the top 40 of the Evaluation Rankings were gathered.\u201dAs I tilted my head at those words, Lee Hayeon opened her mouth as if she would explain to me.\u201cThe challenger on the hard difficulty who's below the 7th floor didn't even get to pass by the meeting room.\u201d\u201cThey don't count as a combat power, and they don't have much information, so we only gathered top-ranked challengers who have encountered challengers from another world.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dI mean, what's the benefit of summoning even the lower-ranking challengers to the meeting room?However, when I looked around, Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonsuk were nowhere to be seen.Of course, there was a possibility that they hadn't returned from the Tower yet, but that was unlikely.Because they told me that they were planning to return to Earth after finishing the trial on the 10th floor.They probably wouldn't have spent time training like me to raise the skill level and even implement Sword Ki.And they should've already returned to Earth, even if they were late because they had to sign an additional contract with another administrator.\u201cAre there any challengers at the top of the Evaluation Rankings who didn't attend here?\u201d\u201cTo some extent, there are people who couldn't be reached or have already moved.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by moved?\u201d\u201cIt's simple. Those who said they have no intention of supporting the Japanese Hunter Association and only provided information, or those who already went to Japan.\u201dWent to Japan?I stared at Lee Hayeon as I wondered what that meant, and soon her explanation followed up.\u201cAs you know, the Japanese Hunter Association requested help from the Hunter Associations of other countries.\u201d\u201cAt that request, one of the hunters, who became a challenger in the United States, said that they would go directly, and two people from Korea also went to Japan in advance.\u201d\u201cCould you please tell me who those two challengers from Korea are?\u201dAt that, Lee Hayeon nodded her head and revealed who those two were.\u201cI'm pretty sure it was Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonsuk? The 1st and 2nd place in the Evaluation ranking went to Japan together.\u201dAs soon as I heard her words that followed, I felt that a glimmer of possibility had entered my hand.It was none other than the possibility of breaking through Namgung Hyuk through the cooperation of Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonsuk.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 86": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Boundless NecromancerThe Boundless Necromancer Chapter 85\nNewPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 85: Dimension Invasion (4)Originally, I was going to get some help from the Korean Hunter Association to deal with Namgung Hyuk, but\u2014After hearing Lee Hayeon's words, there was no need to borrow the hands of the Korean Hunter Association.Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonsuk were challengers on a whole new level among the challengers in Korea.'If I fight along with them, I think I have a winning chance against Namgung Hyuk.'I could guess as to why they had gone ahead to Japan in response to the request for support from the Japanese Hunter Association.The two had a style where they clearly weighed their gains and losses, and as such, they didn't move without enough compensation.Moreover, the Korean Hunter Association seemed to be quite free in recruiting challengers, despite the Japanese Hunter Association's request for support.Just like how they left the low-rank challengers as it was when they didn't agree to join, although they were sufficient enough to be recruited.It seemed that they had no intention of spending manpower calling challengers to the Japanese Hunter Association.Nevertheless, the fact that the two quickly moved to Japan meant that they thought they could earn a commensurate reward in Japan.Where did the reimbursement come from that they risked going straight to Japan when these people didn't even get stronger like me by absorbing souls?It was something obvious that you didn't even have to see.'The Japanese Hunter Association must've offered them a reward.'It'd also be a reward worth moving the two of them.Some challengers may have moved to deal with this situation themselves, even from overseas.In addition, it was clear that the existing S-rank hunters would've stepped in to prevent the situation in Japan.They must've thought like I did that if they all gathered together and attacked all at once, there was no way that Namgung Hyuk couldn't be killed.At that moment, when I was about to ask Lee Hayeon if any more hunters had moved to the Japanese side.Click.The meeting room door opened, and a man who appeared to be an employee of the Hunter Association stepped in.Then the eyes of the challengers who were sitting in their seats doing their other stuff moved their gazes to him.\u201cHello, challengers.\u201dLooking at him, continuing to speak calmly as soon as he glanced around the conference room, I laughed.'I knew it was a face I've seen somewhere before\u2026'I never imagined that we'd meet here like this.\u201cMy name is Lee Seungjin, the leader of the Challenger management team of the Korean Hunter Association.\u201dThe leader of the challenger management team at the Korean Hunter Association was someone I knew.He was a challenger who once introduced himself as an rank hunter in the Tower, and I immediately remembered him because he was the one who showed me around the public area.After mentioning that he dealt with information, we parted ways, telling me to look for his services often\u2026 but to think that we met here again.'If you look at it this way, the Hunter industry is quite narrow.\u201dAs I felt dumbfounded and chuckled, Lee Seungjin soon started talking.\u201cThank you to the challengers who have gathered here in response to the call.\u201dHe kept a serious expression and glanced around the challengers once.As though he was trying to figure out the level of the challengers in this conference room.\u201cEveryone must have a rough guess about what's going on. Since an emergency summons was issued due to a challenger from another world who appeared in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo.\u201dThe challengers in the meeting room frowned in displeasure at his words instead of responding.It was an attitude that they didn't understand why they had to gather here because of that incident.However, Lee Seungjin continued to speak fluently.\u201cAs you all may know, the challenger from another world who appeared by moving through dimensions\u2014 without any penalty of floor intrusion \u2014has been stirring up the downtown area of Shinjuku ward.\u201d\u201cIn response, the Japanese Hunter Association concluded that it was impossible to subdue the challenger from another world with Japan's power and requested support.\u201d\u201cOf course, there's Korea also among them.\u201dWhen he finished that sentence, the middle-aged challenger sitting in the corner of the meeting room showed irritation with a husky voice.\u201cSo what are you trying to say? Are you telling us to go to Japan and kill that crazy bastard who killed six rank hunters in a matter of seconds?\u201d\u201cThe Japanese side insisted so. Since the challenger from another world mentioned the name of the Korean challenger, the Korean challenger is also responsible.\u201d\u201cBullshit. How do you even know if that's true? Are you driving people to the edge with things that you don't even know if it's true?\u201dSome of the challengers frowned at the reckless words and actions of the middle-aged man, but he wasn't wrong in general.The levels of the challengers here were too low to subdue the challenger from another world who appeared in the Shinjuku ward.Even if they got a high rank in the Evaluation Ranking, their skills were just a little higher than that of an rank hunter.Because they all knew about it, the backlash was fierce, and Lee Seungjin nodded as though he knew it.\u201cThe Hunter Association is well aware of that fact. The reason why everyone has gathered here isn't to unilaterally notify the challengers that everyone will be sent to Shinjuku-ward.\u201d\u201cThere are only two reasons why the Hunter Association has even issued an emergency summons and gathered all of the challengers on hard difficulty.\u201dLee Seungjin slowly lowered the screen in the meeting room and continued his words.\u201cFirst, to show the battle video secured of a Chinese S-rank hunter who went to support Shinjuku-ward, and\u2026\u201dThe meeting room became rowdy as a video appeared on the screen that was lowered, but\u2014\u201cSecond, to raise awareness to you people by showing the video of that challenger from another world who appeared in Shinjuku ward.\u201dLee Seungjin didn't waste time and immediately played the video, and soon the meeting room became quiet.It was understandable.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Because in the video that appeared on the screen, a drone flying in the sky began to record a young man sitting in the middle of the street.The Chinese-style young man, whose eye-bags emphasized his decadent beauty, was sitting quietly with his legs crossed.'So that's Namgung Hyuk?'It was for a short time that I was a little surprised by his unexpectedly ordinary attire.-\u2026I don't know why only the insects keep on bugging me one by one, instead of the one I called.Namgung Hyuk, who was sitting down quietly, muttered and looked up at the sky.To be precise, he frowned as though he was displeased as he looked at the sky where the drone was flying.I expected the drone to be destroyed, watching Namgung Hyuk get up from his seat.But\u2026-I never thought that you'd welcome me this fiercely, you know?Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksContrary to what I expected, the situation where the drone gets destroyed didn't occur.Instead of destroying the drone, Namgung Hyuk turned his gaze to the middle of the streets of Shinjuku Ward.And walking towards him, a black-haired man with explosive muscles stood out.\u201cThe person walking over there is Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n, who was acknowledged as an S-rank hunter in China about a month ago.\u201dIn short, it means that he was no different from being the main character of this battle video.However, I realized that Lee Seungjin's intentions for showing this video weren't good.I was able to predict what would happen to the hunter named Feng Z\u01d0 w\u00e9n, who appeared in the video.However, all the challengers inside the meeting room looked at that scene with a nervous look, as though they couldn't predict like me.[email\u00a0protected]#%&[email\u00a0protected]##\u2026Then they frowned as they saw the sight of Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n grinning and muttering.It seems like the language wasn't interpreted because he was an ordinary hunter from a foreign country, not a challenger from the Tower.Back in the Tower, anyone could understand the language, but since he wasn't a challenger, they couldn't understand each other's language.However, Namgung Hyuk nodded his head as though he understood what he was saying.-I got it. It seems like you aren't the type to listen to me.Perhaps he has a separate ability to interpret languages?I didn't know what Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n was blabbering about, but he seemed to realize that Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n was hostile to him.Soon he stood up, let out a bitter smile, and placed his hand on the hilt of the curved sword on his waist.-Well, I didn't think I'd be able to achieve my goal right away anyway.Namgung Hyuk drew his sword as soon as he finished his words, and at that moment, an unbelievable situation happened.Slaaaaaaaaash!The buildings around him all started to cut and fall down without any warning, and\u2026Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n, who was approaching Namgung Hyuk relaxedly, was startled and stepped backward.-Pathetic. Consider it a shame that you attacked me with such trivial skills.With those words as last, Feng Z\u01d0 w\u00e9n rushed toward Namgung Hyuk while screaming out of spite.And after that, a battle that could only be called truly transcendent began to take place.Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n swung his fist with all his might and clashed with Namgung Hyuk, but the result wasn't good.Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n was the one who got injuries, although it was a battle in which the ground cracked and the air burst whenever they exchanged an attack.Rather, Namgung Hyuk parried all of\u00a0 Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n's attacks and slashed his whole body, gradually accumulating damage.The battle was concluded after only a few minutes had elapsed.-You were worth seeing for a person who can't even wield Fist Ki. You may die in peace.Slaaash!The moment Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n's body split in half and spilled blood and organs.Namgung Hyuk turned his back as though he wasn't interested and sheathed his weapon.A complete defeat.Then, the challengers in the meeting room were shocked by the result that could only be described as such.-If you make me waste more time, this city will experience something more terrible.Namgung Hyuk looked at the drone floating in the air, muttered coldly, and then drew his sword again.Bzzzzzt!After that, the drone showed a black screen with noise, unable to capture anything.He's strong.'It's not simply just a high level of physical ability or such.'Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n, who fought Namgung Hyuk just now, wasn't a weak hunter either.If I fought Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n, I wouldn't lose, but that didn't guarantee I'd win against him.'And he killed such a skilled person in less than a few minutes, huh.'I was feigning a smile at the strength that could be called a monster among monsters.\u201cDid you see the challenger from another world without the floor intrusion penalty?\u201dLee Seungjin, who was looking at the video on the screen, looked around the meeting room and opened his mouth.\u201cThis is the reality. The Tower of the Trials is definitely not a place to compete.\u201dLee Seungjin narrowed his eyes and continued his words calmly.\u201cWe all need to disclose all the hidden information and prepare to prevent this kind of situation from happening again.\u201dOnly then do the challengers inside the meeting room frowned as if they had grasped Lee Seungjin's intentions.He was basically telling the high-ranking challengers, who were reluctant to disclose information, to disclose all information.They didn't gather only the challengers on a high rank of the Evaluation Ranking for nothing.As the atmosphere inside the meeting room died, Lee Seungjin opened his mouth again.\u201cWe'll only send the people who wish to go for the current request of the Japanese Hunter Association.\u201dAt those words, the faces of the challengers in the meeting room brightened up evidently.They thought that they'd be forced to be driven out to a deadly place where even an S-rank hunter died helplessly. But they had the right to choose.There would be no other good news for them at the moment.\u201cBut if you don't respond to the request for help, please at least disclose the information.\u201dOf course, Lee Seungjin firmly confirmed that choice wasn't completely free.If you wanted to ignore the request of the Japanese Hunter Association, you had to provide some information.However, it seemed like most of the challengers had no intention of opposing that now.Perhaps it was the same for Lee Hayeon. She smiled softly, pushed her face towards me, then whispered silently in my ear.\u201cThings are better than I thought. We won't be assigned if this goes on.\u201dShe seemed quite anxious because she was also selected as a high-rank challenger, but\u2026Contrary to what Lee Hayeon thought, my dissatisfaction was filling up.Even though Namgung Hyuk was strong, she said that Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonsuk went to Japan.They didn't conclude that there was no chance of winning at all, even in this situation, and that was the same for me, too.Although it was slim, the odds of winning existed, and it felt like I could at least inflict fatal damage on him.'I didn't wanna stand out, but I guess I can't help it.'In the end, I prepared myself to stand out and raised my hand in the toned atmosphere.\u201cI'll go to Shinjuku ward, Tokyo, following the request of the Japanese Hunter Association.\u201dNot only the challengers who were sitting in the meeting room but also Lee Seungjin stared at me as if they were dumbfounded.All the gazes looking at me seemed to tell me this at once.They didn't know that crazy bastard who would go into such a deadly place on their own actually existed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Sungyeun-ssi?\u201dLee Hayeon even lifted her toes from the chair to come up and whispered in my ear.She asked me to say that what she just heard was something she misheard, but\u2026Unlike her, who doesn't want to fight Namgung Hyuk, my head was full of thoughts about wanting to fight the challenger from another world.Namgung Hyuk in the video was stronger than I thought, but that didn't mean I was going to completely be defeated.My limbs might be torn off a few times, but it wasn't a level where I'd die, considering it's a situation where the other challengers would be present.Therefore\u2014\u201cIt's not a slip of the tongue nor a thoughtless word.\u201dWithout further denial, I firmly conveyed my intentions, even by putting mana into my voice.Only then, Lee Seungjin, staring at me blankly, frowned as if he had come back to his senses and opened his mouth.\u201cI\u2026 remember you, Han Sungyeun-ssi.\u201dHe soon stared straight at me and said he knew me.\u201cAnd the fact that you're always in the top 3 of the Evaluation Rankings.\u201dI didn't recall telling him about the Evaluation rankings, so it must be information Lee Seungjin found out.I didn't really care as to why he knew the rankings.I was prepared for my ranking and name to be revealed since the time I had repeated battles with my real name in the arena anyway.\u201cSo what?\u201d\u201cI just don't get it. Why would someone as talented as you would say that you want to help Japan?\u201d\u201cBecause that's the path where I can grow.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cYou mentioned Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonsuk went to the Japanese Hunter association, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026That's right. They said they'd go even if they didn't have to.\u201d\u201cMy reason is in a similar vein.\u201dHearing what I said, Lee Seungjin narrowed his eyes and bit his lips.\u201cI see. You're thinking about the reward that the Japanese Hunter Association will provide you.\u201d\u201cEven if there's a cause, people won't gather if there's no reward after all.\u201d\u201cAre you planning to go there just to get a Skill Proficiency potion?\u201d\u201cA Skill Proficiency potion, huh? So that's the reward offered by the Japanese Hunter association.\u201d\u201cYou were saying you'd go even if you didn't know about it? Even if it's a Skill Proficiency potion, it's a potion that only increases proficiency by 10%.\u201dLee Seungjin stared at me as though he was asking if it was really worth risking my life for, but\u2014That didn't mean I could tell him I changed my mind and not go.This was because, apart from my justification, Namgung Hyuk was a challenger from another world that appeared because of me.Moreover, rank hunters died because of that, which had a huge impact on the city too.And just because the risk is high, I should save myself and run away from it because the reward doesn't seem like much?I couldn't tolerate that.And at the same time\u2014\u201cIf you let go of it just because the reward isn't much, you'll end up being eliminated one day.\u201dThe Skill Proficiency potion wasn't an item that could be underestimated.To think that you can arbitrarily increase the proficiency of one of your skills by 10%?Although its performance was slightly lower than the Skill Proficiency potion obtained as a common reward for the 10th-floor trial\u2026It wasn't a reward that could easily be ignored, so my desire to fall back further disappeared.\u201cNow I understand why you became a ranker, Han Sungyeun-ssi.\u201dLee Seungjin looked at me, opened and closed his mouth repeatedly, and then he said as though he was dumbfounded.\u201cYou are\u2026 not normal.\u201dAt those words, I giggled and replied casually.\u201cI've known that for a long time.\u201dBecause I already knew that I wasn't normal.I went straight to Incheon Airport and immediately departed for Japan through the ticket that Lee Seungjin had booked.It seemed like Lee Seungjin didn't want to let me go, but\u2026In fact, there was no way for him to forcibly ignore a request for support from the Japanese Hunter Association when I was willing to go.I could easily guess why he didn't want to let me go.'It should be uneasy to see three Korean ranker-level challengers responding to the summons of Japan.'The challenger from another world that appeared in Shinjuku ward, Tokyo is currently a monster among monsters.From the point where the video of Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n, who was said to be China's S-rank hunter, helplessly getting killed was released.It'd be complicated for them to send a challenger who may not have been trained properly yet.'The Korean Hunter Association must be afraid of the worst-case scenario.'The worst-case scenario.That would probably be a situation in which Kim Seunghoon, Oh Choonsuk, and myself all get annihilated all at once.Among the challengers belonging to the Tower of Trials, we were listed in the highest ranking in Korea.The damage that Korea would receive would be enormous if we die, so they would've rather wished for me not to go.However, how could I not respond when Kim Seunghoon and Oh Choonsuk responded to it?Surprisingly, Lee Hayeon didn't deny my decision, unlike Lee Seungjin did til the end.She let me go, saying there was no use stopping me if it was my decision, and I believed it was the right thing to do.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Of course\u2026[Lee Hayeon: Please give me a call when you arrive at the Japanese Hunter Association.][Lee Hayeon: If it seems dangerous, you must run away immediately.][Lee Hayeon: And if you have an item you need, request them from the Japanese Hunter Association no matter what.][Lee Hayeon: Also, request for a recovery potion as a basic support item. Got it?][Lee Hayeon: And\u2026]On the contrary to letting me go easily, she nagged me constantly through messenger.There was a hint of anxiety in her words.While reading her messages, I smirked and turned off the screen of my smartphone.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201c\u2026She does really seem worried about me.\u201dEven my mother, who died a long time ago, wasn't this extreme.However, I honestly couldn't really understand Lee Hayeon's behavior.In fact, I only belonged to the White Silver guild by contract, and I wasn't a proper guild member.The White Silver guild was just a supplier for the dungeon or a middleman for me.And it was clear from the contract alone that we weren't building any further relationship.However, Lee Hayeon was always kind, asking if there was anything she could do to help me.Even when the White Silver guild placed a condition on me to clear the dungeon, she always prioritized me.Should I say it felt like she was actually showing care for me, not just a contractual relationship?That was the problem. She cares about me, not by a give-and-take structure.It complicated my mind so much that I wondered if I should change how I treated her.Even more so because there was nothing I could do for her right now.However\u2014That complicated feeling soon faded as the plane I rode landed in Japan.I slowly stood up from my seat as I listened to the announcement from the plane that followed.Now, the time had come to put an end to other thoughts and really head to the Japanese Hunter Association.Just as I was about to leave the airport, a Japanese woman approached me at the airport entrance.\u201cAre you perhaps the challenger, Han Sungyeun?\u201dLooking at her speak fluent Korean, I soon opened my mouth.\u201cAre you from the Japanese Hunter Association?\u201d\u201cYou're right. I'm here to pick you up, Challenger Han Sungyeun.\u201d\u201cMy name is Arie Chika. Nice to meet you.\u201dSurprisingly, they were pretty low-key for those who claimed the Korean hunter Association was responsible.I thought they would've been raging at the fact that a Korean challenger was mentioned from the mouth of a challenger from another world.But Arie Chika, who was currently looking at me, was polite rather than rude.I definitely liked that.\u201cNice to meet you too. Arie-ssi.\u201dI asked her to guide me to the Japanese Hunter Association immediately, and she quickly picked up my luggage and escorted me to her car.There wasn't much to talk about, so I closed my eyes and waited until we arrived at the Japanese Hunter Association.\u201cChallenger Han Sungyeun, we have arrived.\u201dAs I heard Arie Chika saying so, I got out of the car and looked around the building.People were unusually crowded in this area, unlike on our way here and at the airport.Judging from the fact that I could sense most of them having mana, it seemed that hunters or challengers were moving in and out.'Looks like only the hunters and challengers are busy because of the Shinjuku ward incident?'The civilians didn't even appear on the streets due to the incident in the Shinjuku ward.I was somewhat also disturbed by the sight, as though an apocalypse was actually upon us, but\u2026\u201cChallenger Han Sungyeun, please follow me. Others are waiting inside.\u201dFollowing Arie Chika's guidance, I soon turned my head and entered the building.And\u2014I knew immediately who the people waiting inside were that Chika Arie was talking about.There were two familiar faces that I'd seen before inside the meeting room, which was the destination she had led me to.\u201cIt's the first time we've seen each other since the trial of the 10th floor.\u201dI greeted them right away as I sat down in front of the two of them.\u201cKim Seunghoon-ssi, and Oh Choonsuk-ssi.\u201dThey both looked at me and soon greeted me.\u201cYeah. I never thought I'd see you here.\u201dOh Choonsuk spoke to me as if whispering with a stiffened face, and\u2026\u201cYou arrived later than I expected.\u201dKim Seunghoon said so while still wearing a black mask that didn't reveal his face.He acted as though he knew I was coming here, but it wasn't surprising.Because I also knew that Kim Seunghoon would definitely come here.However\u2014\u201cIs this all the people who gathered at the request for support from the Japanese Hunter Association?\u201dI couldn't hide my disappointment as soon as I looked around the meeting room.Because no one was sitting in this meeting room right now other than the three of us.\u201c\u2026They said that an additional challenger will arrive from the United States soon.\u201dKim Seunghoon stayed silent for a moment and answered, but it wasn't really great news.I was ridiculed for the situation where the four challengers were the only forces.Of course, it was safe to say that we three had the skills of an S-rank hunter, but\u2014The challenger from another world who was currently in Shinjuku ward was an opponent that it'd be uncertain if we'd be able to hunt down, even with the three of us.'Moreover, I don't even know how strong the challenger who's arriving additionally from the US is, so\u2026'I thought that it'd be better without them if the challenger who would arrive soon was weaker than I expected.But while I was lost in thought, I turned my head to the sound of the meeting room door opening.I could see a red-haired woman walking in through the meeting room door.And\u2014\u201c\u2026Huh?\u201dAs soon as she entered the meeting room, she looked at me and muttered as if she were dumbfounded.\u201c\u2026Why are you here?\u201dAt the same time, I couldn't help but look at her and say this while making a hollow smile.Who would've thought she was the American challenger who'd be arriving last?\u201c\u2026That's my line, you see.\u201dKatheryn Benett.She's a strong person who wields the powers related to the fire that I once fought in the arena.And a challenger who left a loaded statement that she would visit me in the future, just before she was defeated in the battle.She was the American challenger who had arrived at last.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

We met briefly at the Tower.\u201dWell actually, we met briefly and fought in the Colosseum close to death, but Katheryn Benett didn't deny what I said either.She just bowed her head and came to the left of my seat, and silently sat down.Just then, Arie Chika nodded as if she understood it and opened her mouth again.\u201cI see. Well, that's great. Since I had to introduce her to everyone anyway.\u201d\u201cCurrently, no further support will come from the Japanese Hunter Association.\u201dOh Choonsuk, sitting still, was the first to react to her words.\u201cW-Wait. Wait a second. What do you mean by that? Are you saying there are no more supporting challengers or even hunters?\u201d\u201cTo be honest\u2026 there'll be no more hunters and challengers coming here. The situation has become worse than they thought, and it seems that they are restricting the support of challengers as well as the hunters.\u201dOh Choonsuk kept on opening and closing his mouth as if he was speechless at that, but\u2026Katheryn Benett, who sat on my left side, and Kim Seunghoon showed no signs of agitation.And that was the same for me.All unreasonable situations in the world derive from a lack of ability.If Japan hadn't been a weak country in terms of hunters, other countries would've actively supported their hunters.Since it would be a country that holds that much value, there won't be much to lose since it's a fight with a high chance of winning.However, Japan is a country with only one S-rank hunter and 40 rank hunters.Moreover, six of those 40 rank hunters have already died, and the S-rank hunter from China was also killed.In this situation, no country would allow further aid to Japan, which has been labeled as a weak country in terms of hunters.There was no reason for other countries to help Japan while bearing the huge loss.'That's the reality.'There would be no hunters or challengers who'd volunteer to go either.To be frank, I had to say that the four challengers gathered here are abnormal.Because normally, no one would respond to a request for support even if they were told that it wouldn't be necessary for this situation.\u201cAs of now, no one is willing to help Japan.\u201dArie Chika revealed a little bit of gloom and continued her words.\u201cI understand that all of you are perplexed. Since the monster that appeared in Shinjuku-gu of Tokyo certainly has an out of standard power.\u201dBut she soon erased the gloom and spoke with power in her voice.\u201cBut we have a winning chance.\u201dAs she spoke those words, she looked at Katheryn Benett and said confidently.\u201cWith the ability of Katheryn Benett, we can turn the tables of this fight.\u201dThat she's the one who could bring the initiative to our side in this fight.In an instant, the gazes in the meeting room began to focus on me.To be exact, it was towards Katheryn Benett sitting right next to me.\u201c\u2026Among the powers I have, there's a power called 'Suppression of Fire.'\u201dJust then, she broke the silence and opened her mouth to explain her ability.\u201cIf I can make the flame triggered by this power reach an opponent stronger than me, at most, the opponent's max stats will drop by -10, and some skills will be sealed randomly.\u201dI could see why Arie Chika looked at her and said she could be the one to turn the tables in this fight.\u201c\u2026You must have a great administrator. To acquire such an overpowered power.\u201dThe ability that Katheryn Benett had was truly overpoweredTo the extent that Kim Seunghoon, who had rarely opened his mouth so far, spit out a word as if it was ridiculous.\u201cI won't deny it.\u201dKatheryn Benett also kept her proud face and responded so.Then she glanced and smiled softly at me.Should I say her eyes shone brightly like a puppy waiting for a compliment?\u201cThat's amazing.\u201dI felt burdened by the look in her eyes, hoping for a reaction, so I had no choice but to say something.\u201cI know, right?\u201dThen I made a smirk as I watched Katheryn Benett nodding her head in satisfaction.At first glance, her outward appearance is arrogant, but I didn't expect she'd act this way just because she heard a word of praise.Although her behavior felt childish, I just accepted it and turned my head.\u201cAnyway\u2026 with her powers, we can seize the chance to victory.\u201dThen, Arie Chika cleared her throat and began to continue.\u201cHowever, the condition under which her ability activates is important.\u201d[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Conditions for power activation.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksI narrowed my eyes and opened my mouth at those words.\u201cSo the fire must reach the challenger from another world.\u201d\u201cThat's right. Otherwise, the ability called power won't activate, apparently.\u201d\u201cBut there's no way the challenger from another world will willingly get struck by that fire.\u201d\u201cSo, in short, we'll have to create a situation where Katheryn will trigger the 'Suppression of Fire'.\u201d\u201cYou're wise. Exactly.\u201dHearing that, Kim Seunghoon threw a word as if it were nothing.\u201cIf It's just that, I can make that as much as you want.\u201dAfter that, Oh Choonsuk hesitated as though he was worried, then soon nodded his head.\u201cMm\u2026 I don't know if it's possible. But well, I'll try my best.\u201dUnexpectedly, he didn't seem confident in his voice, but I knew Oh Choonsuk's capability.He was the one who swept the army in battle, probably because he had mastered magic-based skills professionally.Of course, he couldn't beat me because I supplemented my mana and stamina through souls.Even so, Oh Coonsuk was clearly a strong person to say that he's weak because of that.There wasn't much to worry about.And\u2014\u201cI don't think there's anything more to discuss now, so let's get going.\u201dI didn't have anything else to quibble over.Since I even learned how to properly use the Sword Ki in the waiting room.In fact, I had concluded that there would be no situation in which I'd be a hindrance to the party.Arie Chika also looked at me and then nodded in agreement to some extent.\u201c\u2026If there's no one who wants to come up with a more specific plan, we'll do so.\u201dOf course, none of the four wanted to plan out a specific plan.Assessing each other's capability was a kind of trick that we acquired while climbing the Tower.Everyone instinctively knew that none of those who came here were unskilled to strategize and fight.\u201cI'll respect your decision. The helicopter is waiting on the roof right now, so let's depart immediately.\u201dArie Chika immediately led us out of the meeting room, and I followed.It didn't take long to get to the roof and hop on the helicopter.As soon as I got on the helicopter, I felt it moving, accompanied by noise, and the helicopter departed for its destination.We didn't even talk to each other properly, and most of us just waited for the arrival without moving, with our eyes closed.Even Oh Choonsuk, who had been nervous and perplexed earlier, had a calm face as if waiting for the upcoming battle.Only Katheryn Benett looked outside and glanced at me from time to time.It seemed like everyone didn't think that this battle would be that difficult.Would it be because they all had a history of encountering a challenger from another world many times?It was then that I had a flood of thoughts regarding this.\u201c\u2026I didn't originally plan to meet like this.\u201dKatheryn Benett, who had only been glancing at me, said so out of the blue.\u201cActually, I wanted to meet in a little bit more ordinary way.\u201d\u201cHow can we meet normally when we didn't meet normally from the beginning.\u201d\u201cThat's\u2026 well, true. Our first meeting wasn't ordinary either, hah.\u201dSoon, Katheryn Benett accepted the fact and sighed.\u201cThere's something I want to know\u2026 Are you like a newcomer with experience?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cI did a search for you on the Korean Hunter Association website, you see.\u201d\u201cHowever, only one record appeared on the website of the Korean hunter Association.\u201d\u201cI must've appeared as a C rank hunter there.\u201dWell in fact, to Katheryn, I might look like a hunter who retired and came back to the field.Aside from getting stronger in the Tower, I became a C-rank hunter through the hunter exam.And I didn't have a lot of records of being active as a hunter since then, after all.\u201cBut whatever you may think, most of it is probably wrong.\u201d\u201cBecause before I entered the tower, I wasn't a hunter.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mea\u2026\u201dIt was the moment when Katheryn was about to ask a question as if she was dumbfounded.Smaaaaaaaaaash\u2026!!With the sight of a building collapsing down with the sound of an explosion, I got startled and, at the same time, looked at Arie Chika, who was in the same helicopter.\u201c\u2026It looks like the challenger from another world is running rampant.\u201dShe looked at the situation outside and soon said so while muttering.\u201cEver since the death of Feng Z\u01d0 W\u00e9n, who responded to the request for support from China, he's been destroying the city like this.\u201d\u201cHe started running rampant at the same time when we started moving in a helicopter. Now you have to prepare for some battle.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201dAs expected from a challenger from Murim dimension, his doings were far out of the expectations.I never imagined that he'd cause such an uproar for not having brought me.I frowned at that fact, then made a decision, stood up, and spoke to Katheryn.Seeing the situation was worse than I thought, I couldn't just stay still.\u201cKatheryn, can you land from the air?\u201d\u201c\u2026What? What do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cI've got a good idea. If this works, you'll be able to cast your power on him right away.\u201d\u201cUh\u2026 I believe I'll be able to land somehow if it's this much height?\u201d\u201cThen that should be enough.\u201dI immediately wrapped my arm around her waist and headed out of the helicopter.\u201cExcuse me for a second.\u201d\u201cW-W-Wait, what are you planning to\u2026!?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by what?\u201d\u300cActivating Power, 'Wings of Steel'.\u300d\u201cWe're gonna fly.\u201dAnd at the same time, I went out of the helicopter while controlling the wings extending from my back.Whiiish!Like a bird, I spread my wings and flew to the city's center where the roars were breaking out\u2026At a speed that could only be called transcendental.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I just thought it was amazing to be flying in the sky.\u201dI couldn't leave Katheryn behind when the full-scale fight with Namgung Hyuk would be starting soon.Because of Namgung Hyuk, who had begun to indiscriminately destroy buildings in Shinjuku ward, I had no time to explain.Of course, we could've fought Namgung Hyuk after waiting for the collapse, but the goal wasn't just to defeat Namgung Hyuk, but also to protect the city.That's why I couldn't wait any longer, and I was flying with my wings straight out like this.Perhaps she noticed that fact. She became quite calm, unlike a while ago, struggling for me to let her go.\u201cIn all honesty\u2026 you're insane. You must have a screw loose somewhere. Who in the world would agree to fly without explanation in that situation?\u201d\u201cNeedless to say, the grunting was still there, but I could obviously bear with it.\u201dI responded to Katheryn's words while pouring some more mana into the wings and increasing my speed.Whiiiish\u2014!\u201c\u2026I couldn't explain one by one and fly in a situation where the city was being destroyed.\u201d\u201c\u2026I know. I'm just saying, so don't take it seriously.\u201dKatheryn said as though she was fed up, then raised her head and looked at me.\u201cSo, what are you planning to do now?\u201d\u201cWhat's the point of asking? We'll go to Namgung hyuk.\u201d\u201cNo, not that. I'm asking about the battle plan.\u201d\u201cYou don't have any? You left everyone else behind and just brought me.\u201d\u201cThat's obviously because you're a person who can't be taken out in this battle.\u201dBut she frowned frustratingly and then let out a deep sigh.\u201cRight now, only the two of us came here, and everyone else is still in the helicopter.\u201cThat's right.\u201d\u201cThen you or I will have to create an opening for that monster to activate the power, right?\u201d\u201cIs that the reason why you asked if I had a battle plan?\u201dThen Katheryn nodded as if she was tired of me, and I quickly fell into my thoughts.That's because I wondered if the bare minimum of a battle plan was necessary like she said.But\u2026'But there really is no such thing as a battle plan.'I immediately concluded that there was no such thing as a battle plan, and there was no need for such a thing.Because\u2014\u201cYou said you can land properly even if you fell from the air, Katheryn.\u201dFrom the moment we came out of the helicopter, I had already decided on how to unleash the strongest attack on Namgung Hyuk through this flight.\u201cThat should be enough. Because there's no need for other battle plans.\u201d\u201cNo, honestly. Are you making fun of me\u2026?!\u201d\u201cHow will you be landing?\u201d\u201c\u2026It's a skill. It's called a leap of purity, and the bearer becomes immune from all fall damage.\u201d\u201cThat's a great skill. I guess there's nothing to worry about.\u201dEven when Katheryn was mad, once she was asked a question, she stopped her tantrum and answered.At that, I lowered my head and gave a bitter smile after looking into her eyes for a moment.I couldn't help but send her a little bit of pity.Because she had to land on the ground without anyone's help from now.\u201cKatheryn.\u201d\u201cI'm sorry, but the battle plan has already been set.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d\u201cI'll slam Namgung Hyuk with my wings while I drop onto Namgung Hyuk.\u201d\u201cWh-What are you talking about!? You might die if you do that!\u201d\u201cIt's fine. I won't die. At most, it'll probably be about breaking a few limbs plus a fracture on my entire body.\u201dI wouldn't die easily because there was the tenacity stat that I'd raised with Necromancy so far.As long as I didn't hurt my head or heart, I probably wouldn't get into that much of a serious situation.I wasn't worried that much because the Ashen Blood skill would shut off the sense of pain and recover quickly.But Katheryn looked at me while opening and closing her mouth, dilating her pupils in disbelief.\u201cB-But that's\u2026 why would you go that far\u2026\u201d\u201cI wonder. These are the only things that I can do, so.\u201dI couldn't win if I didn't risk my life in even a single battle.In the Tower, where defeat means death, I could only risk my life in the beginning.I could survive only by risking my own life and doing nonsensical things.And it continued while climbing the Tower and fighting countless monsters.But Katheryn looked at me like a person who was about to commit a supreme sacrifice and\u2014\u201cYou're really out of your mind.\u201dShe chewed on that word and gazed down with vacant eyes.I couldn't really say anything back, so I just said one statement.\u201cSee you later.\u201dShe'll understand the situation when she actually sees me alive.I freed Katheryn from my left arm and fell to the center, where roars could be heard.It was the center where the building was currently being destroyed, so Namgung Hyuk was probably right down here.In an instant, the speed of the fall increased transcendentally, and soon the air resistance began to push the body away.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]It didn't matter.\u300cUsing the soul of the Earth Snake to replenish mana. \u300d\u300cUsing the soul of the Earth Snake to replenish ma\u2026 \u300d\u300cUsing the soul of the Earth Snake to replenish\u2026 \u300dBy converting all the remaining souls obtained in the trial of the 10th floor into mana, and replenishing all the mana scraped right down to the bottom, I accelerated to the limit.\u300c Activating Wrought Iron Pendant's (B) effect 'Steel's Blessing.' \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

I protected my brain by wrapping my head with the Wings of Steel.And\u2014Slaaaaaaaaaaaam!Then I fell to the ground with a deafening noise.The Namgung noble family.It's a family with such strong prosperity that it's called the best among the five noble families in Murim.And at the same time, it was a huge group where the sword master, who's respected by all martial artists, was present as the previous head of the family.However\u2026-To think that a person born as a young master of the Namgung noble family is dull-witted. What should we do about this?Namgung Hyuk, born in that high-powered Namgung family, had a poor childhood due to the prestige of his family.When he turned six years old, Namgung Hyuk was insulted by his father for being a dull-witted bastard.Dull-witted.In an era where the value of a person is determined only by the talent of their martial arts.The evaluation that Namgung Hyuk had heard from his father could only be said to be disastrous.He was weak, and he couldn't speak properly, unlike other kids.Seeing him, Namgung Hyuk's father despised him until he reached the age of ten.-Your rise of skill level in martial arts has already stopped at this point?At one time, his father persecuted his mother, asking if he was really his son who inherited his blood.And each time, Namgung Hyuk had to listen to his father and mother fight with an empty look.Why is a child, who will be active as a rising star in a few years, like this?Namgung Hyuk's father treated him harshly and persecuted him like that every day\u2026But he wasn't talentless for martial arts or inferior to other children.-Why doesn't everyone understand the sound of the sword?Namgung Hyuk was born with the ability to hear the sound of the sword.It's not that the sword actually speaks, but he just hears the sword ringing.But through that process, Namgung Hyuk was learning martial arts with the sound of the sword.Such as where to swing the sword and where to draw the sword to cut the enemy.Or where you should point the sword to parry the enemy's attack and lead to a counterattack.He could figure it all out through the sound of the sword.Genius.Namgung Hyuk had a talent that can't be stressed enough, even if labeled as a heaven-sent gift.However, Namgung Hyuk's talent was useless to his father, who thought that only the technique of martial arts was everything.-I'm not interested in inferior children who can't even follow a specified movement.At the age of ten, he was branded as an inferior child and regarded as a burden.-You're carving the path of the sword before even following the specified movement. You're a true genius.Until he met his grandfather, the former head of the Namgung noble family and called the swordmaster of that time.From that moment on, from an inferior child who simply couldn't follow a set movement, Namgung Hyuk was raised by his grandfather as a genius of a sword with innate qualities that no one could match.Namgung Hyuk's grandfather respected him, saying that learning a martial art isn't just about following specific techniques.No, to be more precise, he respected Namgung Hyuk's talent.His talent itself, which could only be called violent.The result was simple.-Sword Ki at the age of thirteen, huh\u2026 Your achievement is higher than when I was young.Namgung Hyuk reached the level of a Sword Ki Master at the same time a sudden realization overwhelmed him.It was an achievement that he achieved only three years after he began to learn martial arts properly.At that instant, for the first time, Namgung Hyuk felt a taste of freedom.Blue sky.The fluttering blue Sword Ki resembled the flow of the sky and ran freely.But even if so, he was only at a level where he could hurt people with Ki.Namgung Hyuk was greatly disappointed by that fact, but his grandfather soon turned his disappointment into expectation.-Martial art isn't a path that exists only to kill people, but a path to transcendence.The sword master showed that Namgung Hyuk's Sword Ki wasn't just for killing people.Acquiring god-like abilities through endless self-training is what martial arts are.And he generously informed Namgung Hyuk that the state he had now reached was just the beginning of that path.Originally, Ki was a law that existed in a world so small that it couldn't be seen with the naked eye.A small perceptive world.After condensing the existence of the small world's Ki into the body, which is so small that it can't be observed at all\u2026And twisting the laws of reality by bringing it to the observable realm called the large perceptive world\u2026-The starting point of that is Sword Ki.Twisting the laws of reality so that you could pierce through steel like tofu was the true nature of the Sword Ki.It was around then\u2014\u300cThe Tower of Trials is selecting the right person from the Murim dimension.\u300dNamgung Hyuk was summoned to the Tower of Trials that he heard as a rumor.And he climbed the Tower faster than anyone else and finally made a splendid achievement of climbing up to the 20th floor.It was an incredible feat accomplished at the age of only seventeen, but\u2026-I don't know why there are so many boring people in the world.Namgung Hyuk rather fell into a feeling of boredom because of this, and he didn't climb the Tower and only passed the time.In the meantime, he realized that an interesting element called 'floor intrusion' existed in the Tower.Since then, he has been fighting challengers from minor dimensions who won't cause trouble even if he fights them.In the process, Namgung Hyuk felt that the boredom he began to feel while climbing the Tower was slowly recovering.He felt like the blood that had cooled after a long time of boiling.The challengers of a dimension that wasn't even properly registered in the Tower were weak.However, there were learning opportunities among them, and Namgung Hyuk grew stronger and stronger.Because of that, Namgung Hyuk didn't even climb the Tower properly and only slaughtered challengers from minor dimensions.He found out that the felon that killed Baek Sunhak, the elder of the Murim alliance, was a challenger belonging to a minor dimension.And without hesitation, Namgung Hyuk moved to the small dimension to fight the challenger and caused a bloody slaughter.But this time, something was odd.Namgung Hyuk, who was destroying buildings in Shinjuku-ward of Tokyo, was puking out blood from his mouth.\u201cKohough\u2026.\u201dHe was quite damaged by the unidentified object that had just fallen from the sky.His internal organs of the body were quite damaged, and the flow of the Ki flowing through his body was also greatly disturbed.Still, in the midst of that, Namgung Hyuk kept his eyes open and looked at that something rammed down on the wreckage of the building he was destroying.What had just fallen from the sky slowly recovered its shape from the shape that wrapped itself in its wings and soon turned into a human.And\u2014A man in an old red tailcoat stumbled out of the wreckage of the building.Soon after, he spat out the blood that had gathered in his mouth and muttered to himself as if he was fed up.\u201c\u2026I swear, falling from the sky is something you can't do twice.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It couldn't be seen anywhere.Of course\u2014'This actually regenerates, huh.'Injuries that would've been difficult to regenerate even with a regeneration potion began to heal within seconds.The skeleton of the crushed leg was newly created, the flesh was added, and the lower body returned completely.And for the missing left hand, flesh began to wriggle from the wrist and then immediately reproduced the shape of the hand.I moved my hand, truly feeling relieved about the fact that I had combined the Ashen Blood skill in the waiting room before.Thanks to my hand being intact, I was still holding the Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword safely.And the Vampire Count's Old Tailcoat didn't look damaged either.At that, I stood up, slowly spreading the steel wings that covered my body.Crumble.After standing up from the remains of the building, I dragged my trembling legs and stepped out of the remains.Soon after, I spat out the blood that had gathered in my mouth and muttered to myself as though I was fed up.\u201c\u2026I swear, falling from the sky is something you can't do twice.\u201dIt was then\u2014\u201cWho are you?\u201dI turned my head in the direction where those words were heard.And I was shocked to see the young man in a blue martial arts uniform standing there.Contrary to what I expected, Sword Dragon of the Blue Sky, Namgung Hyuk, wasn't seriously injured.Of course, there was blood running down his lips, but he didn't appear seriously injured as I did.'How come\u2026'The charge that just happened along with the drop was, frankly, the most lethal attack I could make.Even if it doesn't have an infinite amount of usage like Sword Ki, it was certain that it's the best I could do in terms of killing.However, looking at him having not even a proper wound, I couldn't help but be bewildered.But as soon as I saw his swollen right hand and the sword in his hand.I was able to understand why Namgung Hyuk was fine in a way that I wouldn't even want to imagine.\u201c\u2026You, struck me away.\u201dHe struck me, dropping while wrapped in steel wings, away in that instance.As I wrapped myself in wings of steel and dropped, he struck me away with his sword at that instant.No, to be more precise, he must've parried me away with his sword.But that fact alone made me extremely nervous.The charge that I just did was the one that gathered up all my mana in the body and slammed it into Namgung Hyuk.However, Namgung Hyuk recognized this surprise attack and immediately parried it away with a sword.But\u2014\u201c\u2014Didn't I ask you a question? Who are you?\u201dThere was no time for me to feel shocked about it.Claaaaaaang!I had no choice but to frown while blocking the sword that rushed towards me with Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword.He was strong.Namgung Hyuk wasn't only skilled in swordsmanship, but he also had considerable physical abilities.Even though we had just exchanged a single attack, my hands were shaking, and it felt like it was about to break.But, I bluffed even more for that and said while staring straight at Namgung Hyuk\u2014\u201cYou searched for me so eagerly, yet you can't even recognize me when we meet, huh.\u201dThe moment when Namgung Hyuk frowned and opened his mouth at my mockingly spat words.\u201c\u2026What do you\u2014\u201d\u201cYou might figure it out if I do this.\u201dI immediately injected mana within my body into the sword and raised the corner of my mouth.\u300c Activating the power 'Sword Ki Master.' \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Lightning Sword Ki.' \u300dBzzzt!The moment he witnessed the torrent of thunder that raged like a whirlpool around the sword.Namgung Hyuk's eyes changed, and he opened his mouth as if he was in shock.\u201cSword Ki\u2026!?\u201dAnd\u2014\u201cI'm challenger Han Sungyeun.\u201dI roared at that moment, pushing Namgung Hyuk's sword like a storm.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Facing an opponent I could never win, I squeezed out all my strength.\u300c Activating the skill 'Instant Acceleration.' \u300dMovement beyond the limit caused my bones and sinews to creak and damage my body.And with the skill's effect, the mana that flowed through my body ran wildly, and the veins were torn apart.My body rang an alarm and shouted that I wouldn't be able to come back if I crossed the line any further.To the warning that was given to me by life itself\u2026Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

Don't die until other challengers arrive!\u201dSoon after, I noticed Katheryn, who came through the remains of the building, shouting at me not to overdo it.Then, Namgung Hyuk became extremely irritated, as though he realized I wasn't attacking him without any plans.\u201cFilthy little worm, I'll make you regret interrupting my fight.\u201dNamgung Hyuk irritatedly turned around and immediately moved to kill Katheryn, but\u2014He couldn't match me as I reached the level of transcendental mobility by activating all my skills.Claaaang!Sparks burst from the swords clashing, and we both once again assessed each other's gap.At that moment, I was sure that Namgung Hyuk had weakened and spoke sarcastically.\u201cDid you ask if I had stolen Baek Sunhak's sword?\u201d\u201cI'll soon be using your Sword Ki, too.\u201d\u201cHow dare a mere minor dimension challenger fool me with your fake martial arts\u2026!!\u201dIt was then\u2014\u201cI guess you didn't think that you could be defeated by that mere challenger from a minor dimension.\u201dSlaaaaaaaaaaam!Kim Seunghoon, who appeared with a bolt of lightning wrapped around his body, immediately swung his hammer at Namgung Hyuk.Namgung Hyuk frowned at that attack, but he immediately backed away from me and took a defensive position.Baaam!Perhaps the impact was huge, Namgung Hyuk was pushed back, and he had to quickly focus on keeping his balance, but\u2026As though to prevent even that, a stake made out of ice was shot at Namgung Hyuk like a cannonball.Bababang!\u201cI'll assist, too.\u201dIt was a skill activated by Oh Choonsuk, with a magic book spread out in one hand.After even blocking the bombardment of ice, Namgung Hyuk gnashed his teeth as though he was displeased and then opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026It's really annoying that the numbers don't decrease no matter how much I kill.\u201dIn an instant, Namgung Hyuk's eyes split open like the eyes of a reptile. And the moment he began to emit out the bloodlust\u2026As an unknown chill engulfed my body, I sensed a crisis approaching.Intuition.A conclusion reached only by sheer instinct whispered to me.That a ruler of the blue skies, which no one could handle, had awakened.But\u2014\u201cIt must be suffocating to keep wearing a mask, so I shall blow you away in advance.\u201dBefore I could even respond properly to that intuition, Namgung Hyuk moved faster.Just as Namgung Hyuk stretched out his feet, his image appeared in front of Kim Seunghoon's eyes as if the space was folded.Namgung Hyuk accurately struck Kim Seunghoon's black mask with his left fist to destroy it.Slaaaaam!Ignoring Kim Seunghoon, who flew to the remains of the building, Namgung Hyuk changed his target immediately.To none other than Katheryn, who was putting restrictions on him.Of course, Oh Choonsuk hastily activated the magic skill and unfolded an ice barrier, but\u2026It didn't work for a person who could blow Kim Seunghoon away even with restrictions.Clink clank!At the same time, as he destroyed the barrier of ice, Namgung Hyuk stretched out his sword as though to kill Oh Choonsuk.But I moved right there, striking away Namgung Hyuk's sword, and I shot him with a Sword Ki in the form of a slash.Clang!\u201cOkay, I might as well take care of you first.\u201dNamgung Hyuk easily blocked the Lightning Sword Ki with lightning properties and made a bitter smile.Then he reached out and grabbed the air as if he had grabbed me.\u201cForce duel.\u201dAnd\u2014\u300c A duel area is formed within a radius of 30m due to the innate ability 'Force Duel'.\u300d\u300c Entry into the duel area is prohibited except for Challenger Han Sungyeun and Challenger Namgung Hyuk. \u300d\u300c The duel area lasts for 10 minutes and cannot be destroyed. \u300dThen, the moment when the 'Duel area' was formed by the curtain of light, only Namgung Hyuk and I were left.\u201cI didn't want to use it\u2026 but since I'm also carrying a restriction, let's just put it as both of us carrying the same restrictions.\u201dHe muttered so, dissatisfied, and said while looking at me.\u201cI shall teach you that everything you use is nothing more than an imitation of martial arts.\u201dIt was the beginning of a battle without any escape.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

You just wanted to kill me one-on-one because you thought you couldn't handle everything.\u201dI didn't need to provoke as much as a while ago, so I toned down my sarcasm.However, Namgung Hyuk frowned as if even that bothered him greatly.\u201c\u2026How vulgar.

There's no way an ability relying on external factors could be stronger than martial arts.As his grandfather, the sword master, said, martial arts is the only path to transcendence.By controlling the Ki of the invisible world, gradually twisting the laws of reality, and eventually becoming a transcendental person.That was a martial art.There was no way that the kind of ability that wouldn't endure such a process, and supplemented it from an external source, could be anything good.However, Namgung Hyuk had doubts about its existence after being selected for the Tower and learning a skill for the first time.-It's an ability that you can't implement on your own, but you can activate it\u2026?Initially, abilities that depended on external factors were mostly poor or high cost.However, a skill had no such thing, and it was easily activated when the user wanted to use it.Namgung Hyuk was confused by the abilities that denied everything he had built up so far.And while learning the transcendent ability called a skill, Namgung Hyuk came to a realization.There's no self-development in just acquiring and using the skills.-So it's just an ability bestowed by a transcendent being called the Tower\u2026Namgung Hyuk realized that it could be used even if it's impossible to implement on your own.That this was just an ability bestowed by the Tower, and that it was just a fake that's different from the real martial arts.Skills weren't activated by self-controlling the Ki, but were forcibly activated by the system of something incomprehensible.Namgung Hyuk, realizing that, scoffed at everyone who used skills.-What's the value of those who depend on fakes that can't match the real ones?A fake.It was a fake that didn't have the strength to do anything of its own will.It may look like it could become strong on its own like a martial art, but in reality, it's just like offering a handle of an invisible leash to the Tower.Therefore, Namgung Hyuk considered skills as witchcraft that are inferior to martial art and an ability that has no possibility of development.What goes up even if you use a skill is an imaginary number called proficiency, and what changes even if the rank goes up is only the content of the ability.So he thought that skills were fake and martial arts were real.Until he saw Han Sungyeun right in front of him.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u300c Activating the skill 'Ashen Blood.' \u300d\u300c All pain inflicted on the user is reduced by 31%. \u300dThe man in front of him, whose whole body was full of slashes, was different from the others.He wasn't still at a level where he could just conclude that something was different, but\u2026'His eyes are different.'Even though he was driven to the brink of death, Han Sungyeun shone his eyes even more.As if there was still a chance for him to turn the tables in this hell-like situation.Of course, in reality, almost one-sided violence continued, so Namgung Hyuk also thought it was just his imagination.There was nothing special about this man, and he just came this far by relying on fake powers like traits and skills.But that wasn't it.'Why\u2026? Why is he not dying\u2026?'He suffered several fatal wounds, and he should've lost his will a long time ago.But Han Sungyeun was struggling to react to Namgung Hyuk's Sword.As Namgung Hyuk felt annoyed about this, he further maximized his swordsmanship and fired an attack from a blind spot where Han Sungyeun could never react to it.Skills are mostly just inferior abilities of martial arts.Namgung Hyuk tried to overwhelm Han Sungyeun with his swordsmanship under such an extremely Murim-like mindset.In order to drive Han Sungyeun to the point where he wouldn't be able to recover, even with witchcraft, using an attack that he wouldn't be able to see.Then something surprising happened.Claaang!Han Sungyeun easily blocked the Sword Ki that flew from the blind spot instantaneously.Namgung Hyuk immediately realized how he did it.\u300c Activating the skill 'Mind's Eye.' \u300dHan Sungyeun had a skill that could be used in this situation.'This is ridiculous\u2026'But what was even more ridiculous was Han Sungyeun, who blocked the Sword Ki flying from the blind spot.He immediately blocked the Sword Ki and fluttered as if he was lost, and he slowly closed his eyes.Namgung Hyuk realized it was an opportunity and collided with Han Sungyeun while scattering around his Sword Ki.As Namgung Hyuk felt it, Han Sungyeun, with his eyes closed, was driven toward death with more wounds than before.Until then, Namgung Hyuk thought Han Sungyeun had made a foolish choice because he relied on his skills.But starting from some point, things suddenly started to change.Before he knew it, Han Sungyeun blocked Namgung Hyuk's sword as if he could read it while closing his eyes.And as time passed, his movements were unrestrained, as if he had attained enlightenment, moving like he was dancing.Even more serious changes occurred around the time when Namgung Hyuk began to feel impatient.Pssshk!In an instant, Han Sungyeun's sword bent and made a piercing wound on Namgung Hyuk's arm.This wasn't only related to skill but clearly an improvement in skill as well.'How can an imitation of martial arts do up to this extent\u2026?'With Namgung Hyuk's common sense, he couldn't accept the current situation.As to why this man could endure his sword and his movements were getting better while getting wounded.As to why this man could grow so fast while relying on the witchcraft called skills.As to why this man could match a real power with his fake power.None of these were things that Namgung Hyuk could accept.Because this wasn't a skill but closer to the realm of martial arts.Enlightenment.Han Sungyeun has reached the realm of some kind of growth acceleration experienced only by those who have reached the realm of martial arts.And\u2014Namgung Hyuk recognized Han Sungyeun, who was making an arc with the corners of his mouth.This man wasn't just someone who depended on fake things, but he turned fake things into real ones.A ghost blade.The world was dark.As though walking on the road in a hazy state, my body was heavy, and my sense of balance was breaking down.It was natural.Not only did I consume a lot of stamina with the Ashen Blood skill, but I also pushed my mana to the limit.Moreover, I had to keep my eyes closed to activate the Mind's Eye skill, causing more dizziness.But there was nothing I could do.The Mind's Eye, which allowed me to perceive attacks flying from out of sight, could perceive all directions if I closed my eyes.I couldn't survive without relying on my Mind's Eye skill.I didn't know that just 10 minutes could be this painful.But\u2014If you were to ask me if this time was just all about pain for me, it wasn't.\u300c \u2026You've realized what the true Mind's Eye is. \u300d\u300c Skill 'Mind's eye(D-)' ranked up to B. \u300dWas it because I was closing my eyes to block Namgung Hyuk's bizarre swordsmanship?At some point, I could use the Mind's Eye skill as though I really had a third eye.The ability allowed me to recognize attacks from invisible areas.Now I could see the barrier of light within thirty meters and the remains of buildings scattered in it.That wasn't the end of it.\u300c\u2026You purely relied on your senses to fight for your life.\u300d\u300c\u2026Skill 'Sixth Sense (C+)' ranked up to B.\u300dAs the Sixth Sense skill that I had almost forgotten existed ranked up, the senses became clearer.\u300c\u2026In the decisive battle with the one who has mastered the Sword, you succeeded in enduring their sword without dying.\u300d\u300c\u2026Skill 'Demon Slayer (C)' ranked up to B.\u300dAnd my swordsmanship, which I thought felt shabby, grew unbelievably in a short period.\u300c\u2026Your body has experienced regeneration beyond its limits through numerous crises in a short period.\u300d\u300c\u2026Skill 'Ashen Blood (B-) ranked up to B+.\u300dWhile sensing that most of the skills I mainly use had grown, I opened my eyes.And soon, I could see Namgung Hyuk staring at me while quietly holding his curved Sword with both hands.'What?'I wasn't sure how much time was left for the duel, but I was certain that it'd be over soon.But Namgung Hyuk didn't use his sword anymore. He just looked at me while holding his sword with both hands.It was then that I narrowed my eyes as I tensed up.\u201cDo you think you can surpass martial arts\u2026 when you're just borrowing the power from the Tower?\u201dNamgung Hyuk said so all of a sudden and then raised his sword upwards.I was startled when I saw Namgung Hyuk, who was calm although he was in a situation where he should be impatient.It was understandable.Unlike a while ago, Namgung Hyuk's eyes didn't see me as a simple opponent to get rid of.A whole different level of hostility was revealed in his eyes than when he was talking about vulgarity or such.\u201cYour tenacious will, and even that borrowed ability that's nothing more than a fake, I'll put an end to it right here.\u201dAnd\u2026Soon, I could see why Namgung Hyuk was able to declare an end to me so calmly.Before I knew it, the fire that covered Namgung Hyuk's upper body visibly decreased.What that meant was simple.'The duration of the Suppression of Fire is about to end\u2026!?'But even before I, in shock, could prepare myself.\u201cThis is the true Sword Ki that can't be caught up with fake Sword Ki, and\u2026\u201dThe fire on Namgung Hyuk's upper body was completely extinguished.And\u2014\u201cThis is the realm beyond Sword Ki, Sword Flame.\u201dThe Sword Flame, which surpassed the Sword Ki, swept over me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Try your best to avoid it\u2026!\u201dAt the same time, Katheryn's voice is heard from outside. A fire was rushing in from the right side.Looking at that, I quickly distanced further from Namgung Hyuk, but\u2026\u201cDo you think I'll fall for this kind of trick again?\u201dNamgung Hyuk, looking at that fire, stopped on the spot, unlike me, and raised his spirit.\u201cFlying Sword of Blue Sky.\u201dNamgung Hyuk stated as if he was going to put everything in one sword.For a moment, I thought that Namgung Hyuk had activated skill or power, but soon I changed my mind.How can someone who hates skills or traits proudly utter those words like that?I quickly judged that there was no way that it was a skill or power and stared at him.And soon, Namgung Hyuk whirred up his Sword Flame to the limit and started swinging his sword as if dancing.Bababababang\u2026\u2026!!Like the sky that burns in the sunset, the Sword Flame overwhelms the power of fire.At that moment, I stepped out, anticipating that Namgung Hyuk would run wild if this continued.I had to stop him.I can only survive by thrashing him within an inch of his life while he's not running wild any further.That idea didn't leave my head, and I moved my body forcibly.Perhaps I wasn't the only one who got that strong intuition.Whiiish!Kim Seunghoon, who came out of the remains of the building, dashed towards Namgung Hyuk frantically with a hammer in his hand.He must've thought he couldn't just sit by idly when the skill seal and the stat debuff on him were taken off.Namgung Hyuk was still using the Sword Flame to erase the fire, so there was a chance.Shiiiiiiing!Under that one thought, I shot Namgung Hyuk with my Lightning Sword Ki thoughtlessly at my maximum output.However\u2026\u201cRolling Sword of Blue Sky.\u201dThe moment Namgung Hyuk, who erased all the Fire before anyone knew it, uttered so and rotated.Craaaaaaaaaaaaaash!Not only the slash of the Lightning Sword Ki, but the Sword Flame that cuts out everything around it rushed in like a storm.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Horizon.The scene that can only be said as such unfolded before my eyes.\u300c Activating the skill 'Ashen Blood.' \u300d\u300c All pain inflicted on the user is reduced by 60% \u300dAfter my left arm blew up and my right eye was wholly blinded, I looked at the newly-made horizon.It was a horizon created by the gorgeous Shinjuku's disappearance as the whole area's buildings were destroyed.I felt dispirited by the fact that this scene was created by only one man.In fact, Namgung Hyuk was a monster who was far beyond my powers.The Flying Sword of Blue Sky and Rolling Sword of Blue Sky weren't even skills or powers, but purely his technique.Nevertheless, I couldn't stop Namgung Hyuk and was barely holding onto my life.\u300cThe skill 'Counter Shield' was destroyed, and the release of the accumulated damage became impossible.\u300dThe only reason why I was alive was thanks to the Counter Shield and the Ashen Blood.I instantly took stock and blocked the Sword Slash by wrapping around everyone with Counter Shield, putting myself in the center.'\u2026No, I can't say I blocked it properly looking at this.'All I did was cancel out a single attack by exhausting all my mana.I couldn't even utilize the true effect of the Counter Shield, which was the reflection of the accumulated damage.Perhaps I couldn't even cancel the attack out properly. The result was horrible.Kim Seunghoon, who had just escaped the remains of the building, was rammed into a building again, and Katheryn and Oh Choonsuk were knocked out from only the shockwave that passed through the shield.\u201cShit\u2026\u201dIt was a complete defeat.On the other hand, Namgung Hyuk's condition, which caused this devastation, didn't look as severe as mine.Although he was gasping for breath and the hands holding the curved sword were trembling, perhaps his stamina was running low, but\u2026He wasn't on a level like me, where some body parts were completely damaged.Of course, I was also recovering my body through the Ashen Blood, but there was no way that it could recover properly.Maybe my body wasn't regenerating well because all my stamina was depleted.However, Namgung Hyuk seemed to have no Ki left too, so the situation was somewhat similar for now.I lost my left arm and right eye, but Namgung Hyuk was in a state where it was hard to even hold his sword.I thought to myself that it was one hell of a time and soon tightened the grip on the Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword in my right hand.As I tightly grabbed the handle of the sword, red energy flew on the blade immediately.Of course, it's weaker than when the Blood Ki was greatly activated by flowing in the mana, but\u2014'Even if I can't win, I guess I can inflict some fatal wounds together.'At least the minimum amount of means to fight with Namgung Hyuk was prepared.If Namgung Hyuk rushes in to fight more, I'll fight at the risk of my life.That was the conclusion I made.It was at that moment when I was trying to fight again, as I pointed my Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword at Namgung Hyuk\u2014Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201c\u2026Looks like it's not yet the time to settle our fight yet.\u201dNamgung Hyuk silently narrowed his eyes and forced himself to say it in a strained voice.\u201c\u2026This time, I'll admit my defeat. But next time, it'll be different.\u201dI frowned, as it was hard to understand the words that Namgung Hyuk spit out, but I could read his true intention as he took out a blue stone from the burnt, blue martial arts uniform.\u201cInterdimensional movement\u2026\u201d\u201cWill you stop me?\u201d\u201cIf so, one of us will die here.\u201dHe was right.Even though Namgung Hyuk was tired, I lost my left arm and blinded my right eye.I lost my sense of balance from the lack of my left arm, and my sense of distance would've completely disappeared since one eye went blind.'I'll die.'Neither of us would get each other killed easily, but if we clashed properly, I couldn't guarantee my life.Well, Namgung Hyuk wouldn't be able to guarantee his life too, but I didn't want to gamble.\u201cToday, I'll admit my defeat and withdraw, but you and I will face each other again.\u201dNamgung Hyuk barely kept his footing while staggering; he grabbed the blue-colored stone tightly, and\u2014Whirrrr!\u201cFarewell, Ghost Blade.\u201dNamgung Hyuk disappeared by stepping into the blue portal that appeared behind him.It was only after seeing the portal closing like a light turning off that I turned my eyes away.The buildings of Shinjuku were all cut into half with the sword of Namgung Hyuk.\u201cAdmit defeat, my ass\u2026 this is no different from my defeat at this point.\u201dI couldn't protect anything.Like how I lost my parents with the group of monsters pouring out from the dungeon break seven years ago.This time too, I said I'd defend the Shinjuku by killing Namgung Hyuk, but\u2014What I achieved was barely sending Namgung Hyuk back to his original place.To that fact, I felt a pain rising up as if my heart was being twisted.But\u2026Before I could even feel the heartache, the aftermath of the battle came up all over my body.The absence of my left arm, loss of eyesight in my right eye, and other small and big injuries slowly lowered my consciousness.Thud.I fell to the ground and closed my eyes without any resistance.\u201c\u2026You finally woke up.\u201dAfter opening my eyes, I saw the face of Katheryn, a beauty with red hair.She had a surprised face, as though a terminal patient had woken up miraculously.'No, I must've been a severe patient.'Since my left arm blew up to the shoulder, and my right eye went blind\u2026Realizing that, I moved the exhausted body immediately to energize my senses.Then, I could feel the senses of my fingers on the left side and my arm.In addition, the right eye, which was blinded, was recovered to the point where it was possible to distinguish things properly.'Looks like the Ashen Blood did activate properly.'As a matter of fact, the rank of Ashen Blood skill, which had a solid regeneration ability, went up in this battle.There was no way that a skill that originally could regenerate a damaged body couldn't fix this much of the damage.Feeling a sense of relief at that fact, when I slowly rolled my eyes to look around, Katheryn opened her mouth.\u201cWe're in a hospital near Tokyo.\u201d\u201c\u2026Don't you have to get treated, Katheryn?\u201d\u201cAre you saying that knowing what happened to you\u2026?\u201d\u201cYour left arm entirely blew up, and your right eye went blind.\u201d\u201cI know .\u201dIt was a problem that I didn't really mind since it would be recovered by the Ashen Blood skill.But perhaps it wasn't for Katheryn. She continued her words while tearing up.\u201cWe were all safe thanks to you blocking it with the shield, but you're the only one in this shape.\u201d\u201cHonestly, I would've died if it weren't for you. I'm grateful for that.\u201d\u201cAh, yes\u2026\u201d\u201cBut you need to learn how to take care of yourself. If you keep fighting like that, It wouldn't be enough even if you had multiple lives.At her words mixed with emotions, I stared at her for a while and nodded my head.\u201cI'll keep that in mind.\u201dI smiled bitterly at the advice given purely from someone's favor after a long time.Only then she realized that she was getting emotional. She blushed and cleared her throat.\u201c\u2026Anyways, the doctor said you need to take a rest, so please focus on recovering. You are, no, only you deserve to do so.\u201dWith that word as an end, Katheryn took out three small potions from her pocket and handed them to me.\u201cIt's the skill proficiency potion that the Japanese Hunter Association promised as a reward.\u201dIt was a reward that anyone would have to covet, increasing a skill's proficiency by 10%.\u201c\u2026But why are there three?\u201d\u201cOne is yours that was promised to be given to you by default, one is my share of the reward, and one is the potion I originally had.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201d\u201cIt's heavy, so please take it already. To be honest, if I don't do this at least, I'd be ashamed to see the face of my savior.\u201dHonestly, I wondered what was left for her if she did this much for me, but\u2026Seeing her blushing up to the tips of her ears, it was awkward to refuse it, so I soon accepted the three bottles of skill proficiency potion.\u201c\u2026Thank you.\u201dThen Katheryn stood up as if she had finished her job.\u201cThen I'll be going. See you soon.\u201dWith those words as the last, she quickly left the hospital room, and I put three potions in my hand on the table and raised my upper body.\u201cUrk\u2026\u201dI'm sure the injuries were all recovered, but should I say it felt like my whole body was somewhat sore?I could understand why the doctor said that I needed a rest.I walked to the room's window with the slippers that looked like they were given by the hospital.Creaak.\u201cPheww.\u201dI felt the cold winter air flowing in from outside as I opened the window.But contrary to the cold wind, the beating of my heart became hotter.I could figure out right away what this feeling was.A longing.Currently, I was frustrated that I couldn't beat Namgung Hyuk and wanted a stronger power.The heat of my body wouldn't subside, as if a fuse that couldn't be stopped was set on fire.My heartbeat changed repeatedly, as though the different emotions crossed.It beat as if I wanted to go through the intense growth that I achieved in the battle with Namgung Hyuk.It beat from the guilt that I couldn't protect anything this time too, just like how I lost everything seven years ago.It beat purely from the desire to grow to reach the state of Sword Flame that Namgung Hyuk reached.My heart has been beating excessively, but I just looked out the window to soothe its heat.It's not Spring yet, but like this Winter in Tokyo, which will soon pass\u2026Soon the time will come when I'll be able to quench the thirst of this longing.It was time to prepare for growth by using this longing as fuel.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Han Sungyeun.\u201d\u201cAh, the Ghost Blade is here.\u201dKim Seunghoon looked at me and soon said so with a giggle.\u201c\u2026Ghost Blade? Now, what's that?\u201d\u201cIt's a nickname they're addressing you as in Korea and Japan these days, but it looks like you don't seem to know.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ghost Blade, This is my first time hearing it.\u201d\u201cWell, You probably didn't have the time to find it out since you were busy with the politicians and the Japanese prime minister paying a visit to you.\u201dAs though telling me I did well, Kim Seunghoon took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and handed me a cigarette.\u201cWould you like to have one?\u201d\u201cNo, I don't smoke or drink, you see.\u201dIn the past, there was a time when I stopped drinking alcohol or smoking cigarettes, as well as food that wasn't good for my body to increase my physical ability.'Of course, no matter how hard I tried at that time, there was no change in ability in the end, though.'Because of the habits of those days, I tried not to consume alcohol, cigarettes, or anything else bad for my body.\u201cSo you take good care of your body, huh. I wish you could do that in battle, too.\u201d\u201cIt's harder than I thought.\u201d\u201cNo matter how strong the body of a hunter and good regenerative power is, there are limits.\u201d\u201cNo matter what skill you have, if overdoing becomes your habit, you'll eventually die.\u201d\u201cYou're saying the same thing as Katheryn.\u201d\u201cIf you see people overdoing themselves around you, you'll also end up saying the same thing.\u201dI mean, when I was fighting Namgung Hyuk, I felt that I'd die quickly if I overdid it like that.I almost died several times in that one battle, so it must be shocking to others.\u201cWell, seeing that you're still in good shape, it seems that you barely didn't cross that one line, though.\u201dWhile saying so, he soon took off the black mask with one hand and placed it on the railing.There was a crack that looks like a spider's web on the mask as it received the first strike of Namgung Hyuk directly, but\u2026I smirked at Kim Seunghoon's face, which I saw for the first time.Should I say he looked like a handsome middle-aged man with an impression of cheerfulness?'I guess I understand why he's covering his face with a mask.'To think that he has outstanding looks, as well as the highest level of skill among hunters?He's getting less attention because he's covering his face like this, but if he goes around without the mask, it'll attract the attention of people around him, either good or bad.\u201c\u2026Why are you staring at me like that? Is there something wrong?\u201dOf course, Kim Seunghoon didn't seem to be reading what I was thinking, though.\u201cI was just surprised that you look pretty fine after getting struck in the face by Namgung Hyuk.\u201d\u201cAh, that\u2026 Although it looks like this, this mask is a good item, you see.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cOf course, it's almost destroyed, so I think it needs to be repaired, but\u2026 well. It should be fine. I got quite a few repair items anyway.\u201dAfter finishing his sentence, Kim Seunghoon lit the cigarette in his mouth with a lighter.The movement was awkward as it was quite cumbersome to move with only one hand with crutches on.\u201c\u2026You seem to have been quite injured in this battle as well, Kim Seunghoon-ssi.\u201d\u201cI can't help it. Since we had to fight such a monster. Honestly, Namgung Hyuk was on a whole different level from other challengers of the Murim dimension.\u201d\u201cAt least none of the challengers from the Murim dimension I've seen could do ridiculous things like Namgung Hyuk.\u201d\u201cDefinitely.\u201dSince I was told that Namgung Hyuk is a challenger who had reached the 20th floor of the Tower and, at the same time, had a far greater strength than the challengers on the 20th floor.Although we couldn't actually win, sending him back to the Murim dimension was almost like a miracle.As though Kim Seunghoon was vaguely aware of that fact, he had a calm look although we couldn't take him down.And after standing for a while in silence, Kim Seunghoon put out his cigarette and opened his mouth.\u201c\u2026So, what are your plans from now on?\u201d\u201cI wonder. Actually, I don't really have a clear goal yet.\u201d\u201cPerhaps I'll return to the tower soon.\u201d\u201cSounds pretty dull. You don't plan to take a break even a little bit when you've just experienced a near-death crisis?\u201d\u201cWell, I'm fine now, after all. By the way, what are your plans from now on, Kim Seunghoon-ssi?\u201d\u201cUnfortunately, we have the same idea. After recovering from my leg injury, I'll return to the Tower immediately.\u201dI giggled and changed the topic.\u201cDo you know anything about Katheryn or Oh Choongsuk-ssi?\u201dAt those words, Kim Seunghoon narrowed his eyes and said.\u201cRegarding that woman, I don't know a single thing since we never really had a proper conversation, and Oh Choonsuk\u2026 yeah, it seems like he'll only focus on growth for a while in the dungeon of the guild that I run.\u201dThe guild he runs\u2026?\u201c\u2026I mean, you had a guild that you run?\u201dI just thought of Kim Seunghoon as a high-ranked hunter\u2026But seeing that he also runs a guild separately, he seemed to be a really high-ranked hunter to run a guild.Then, Kim Seunghoon nodded his head as though he understood my question properly and continued his words.\u201cAh, come to think of it, I didn't tell you who I was.\u201dKim Seunghoon introduced himself really casually.\u201cI'm the S-rank hunter in Korea, Lightning King.\u201dSoon after hearing his introduction, I couldn't help but be terribly surprised.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Lightning King.Among the 30 or so S-rank hunters in Korea, that title belonged to a different league.Although he's a hunter who acted without revealing his identity, the fame of the Lighting King was spread regardless of whether to a hunter or a civilian.It was understandable.Unlike the hunters who only cry for their rights, the Lightning King destroyed the disaster-like gates that appeared by himself.It couldn't be helped for him to be famous as he destroyed the gates at a speed that even other S-rank hunters couldn't match, and always kept his identity hidden.Currently, the hunter named Lightning King was no different from a hero of Korea.However\u2026'To think that Kim Seunghoon was the Lightning King.'After coming back to the hospital room from the rooftop, I feigned a smile as I looked at the business card in my hand.-You may contact me if anything comes up that you need to get in touch for.The business card I was holding was none other than Lightning King, Kim Seunghoon's, contact information.-I'll be honest. You can consider it as a scout. You may contact me for personal matters or something that isn't.\u201cA scout, huh.\u201dAs a matter of fact, the guild of the Lightning King was nothing more than an exclusive guild composed of a small number of elites.Enough to call it a guild created solely for Lightning King's sake to act.It'd most likely be great in many ways if I joined the guild of the Lightning King.But\u2026'I guess I don't have to decide hastily.'The contract with White Silver was ongoing, and I wasn't feeling much dissatisfaction.So I decided to think about this matter later, and I started checking the equipment in the corner of the hospital room.The Japanese Hunter Association immediately repaired the Vampire Count's Old Tailcoat, which was damaged in the fierce battle with Namgung Hyuk.There was almost no damage to the Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword to begin with, and I didn't have much to worry about the rest of the items.The real problem wasn't the items here but a large number of miscellaneous items in the studio apartment.\u201cI came here to dispose of all of them, but\u2026 I guess I have no choice but to return.\u201dCurrently, I had returned to Earth using the lowest grade return stone.In other words, I'd have to return to the Tower today, which was the third day.Now that there were only a few hours left until my return, I was determined to enjoy the relaxation on Earth as much as possible.Ah, of course, there's also the option of using the return stone right away as soon as I returned to the Tower, but\u2026I didn't want to return to the Earth to the point where I'd purchase the return stone right away.'Wandering around the dungeon and filling the souls wouldn't be a bad option.'However, I currently longed for growth so much that even that time felt like a waste.I knew better than anyone else that the only thing that could satisfy this longing was the Trial of the Tower.And therefore, I thought of returning to the Tower immediately, taking the Trial, and growing through the reward for clearing the Trial.I laid on the hospital bed with all my equipment equipped and turned on my smartphone.I started surfing the web, ignoring my smartphone screen covered with missed calls and unread messages.This was because I was bothered by the fact that Kim Seunghoon told me that Korea and Japan were using the title of Ghost Blade towards me.And\u2026\u300cAre all challengers this insanely strong?\u300dSoon I could see why Korea and Japan started calling me Ghost Blade.Scenes of me fighting Namgung Hyuk were all over the internet.Then I thought for a moment if there was anyone who could film this scene, and\u2026Soon I found out where the source was, through the captured video or photo angle.'Ah, it was filmed from the helicopter.'I figured it out right away when I looked at the angle as though taken by zooming in from above.I was wondering who in the world would come to the battlefield and shoot that scene.The Japanese Hunter Association published an article along with the filmed content, which seemed to have a huge impact.Most of the articles related to me had nothing but similar content.\u300cWho the hell is this hunter and why is he so good at fighting?\u300d\u300cThe other challengers don't stand a chance and are knocked out, but he's the only one who's fighting well. \u300d\u300cHard carried by himself DD: As a matter of fact, isn't he the only one who settled the case this time?\u300d\u300cDoes anyone know about this hunter named Han Sungyeun? Who the hell is this person?\u300d\u300cUsually, when a bigshot like him makes a debut, even their debut will be published in an article, but Hunter Han Sungyeun has no record at all. Fuck.\u300dHalf of the articles were about asking who the hell was Hunter Han Sungyeun and why he's so good at fighting.When I looked at the comments, most of the comments were actually the same as the posts.\u3134I think I know who that person is. There was a player-only gym called Baekryeon, and he only did training for 7 years.\u3134Right. Cap. He never went to a dungeon because he was training for 7 years, and never obtained a license with Hunter exam. Is that what you're trying to say?\u3134No cap, dude\u2026 He's a non-talented player, and was neglected even in the gym. I heard that he had been training for 7 years, but he couldn't raise a single stat.\u3134Does it make sense to you that a talentless bastard who has been training for 7 years and can't even raise a single stat is now competing one-on-one against a monster that can easily slice dozens of buildings?Surprisingly, people on the internet guessed my identity, and my identity was almost revealed, but\u2026Most of the reactions from people were about how an incompetent guy who couldn't raise any of his stats properly couldn't become as strong as me.'Actually, I'm also surprised that I've become this strong.'I didn't deny it.\u300cHe's indeed a Ghost Blade judging from the way he fights. He really fights like a ghost.\u300d\u300cDoes an average person think of falling from the sky to ram a target with the risk of being crushed?\u300d\u300cHe's really damn good at fighting. We gotta admit if he's called Ghost Blade, he's this much for real, Lol\u300d\u300cAh, it's said that they couldn't film a video around the end of the fight with Namgung Hyuk. That's the biggest bummer.\u300d\u300cOne hell of a GOAT battle happened in Japan. Why couldn't they capture it on camera?\u300dLooking at the articles written about me, it seems that the Japanese Hunter Association couldn't leave a video of the latter part of the battle.'Well, I couldn't handle it either when Namgung Hyuk went wild after his restrictions were lifted, so\u2026'To be honest, I thought I might die too when he cut down dozens of buildings with one slash.Just by surviving on that battlefield and bringing this video, I felt that the Japanese Hunter Association was quite courageous.\u201cOther than that, I'm well-known to people now.\u201dGhost Blade, huh\u2026I honestly thought it might be a title that challengers from the Murim dimension would use.But soon, I was able to let out a grin as I pondered that title.It wasn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I felt I wasn't good enough to use the title of Ghost Blade.\u201cShouldn't I be stronger than this if I'm going to be called a Ghost of the sword?\u201dTherefore\u2014\u300cTime over.\u300d\u300cReturning to Tower of Trials.\u300dNow was the time for me to become strong to suit the reputation I had built up.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93: A longing (3)\u300c You have entered the 11th-floor waiting room. \u300dI felt a strange sense of coziness and smiled when I finally returned to the waiting room.To think I was more familiar with this waiting room than Earth now\u2026I realized that I really had changed a lot every time something like this happened.Of course, aside from that realization, I opened the shop window as soon as I returned to the waiting room.This was because there were a few things I learned from the battle with Namgung Hyuk.Ashen Blood.It's a regeneration skill with an overwhelming performance among the skills I own, but\u2026After a fierce battle with Namgung Hyuk, I realized that this skill also has a limit.That is, unlike the skill of pain resistance, the ability to regenerate doesn't activate properly when you're running low on HP.I realized this when I lost my left arm and right eye at the end of the battle.Originally, even if both my legs were crushed, it started the regeneration starting from the bones, but later, my left arm or right eye showed no sign of regeneration at all.'It probably means that the bigger the injury, the more HP it takes to regenerate.\u201dIn fact, the lack of HP was the main problem of the skill 'Accelerated Regeneration', which was the ability before it was combined into Ashen Blood.And because of that, I've been carrying a regeneration potion and replenishing my hp with abilities of Necromancy, but\u2026'Now, even this isn't enough.'I was sure that it was time for me to acquire a new serious HP regeneration ability.Some abilities looked quite useful as I explored the skill shop.\u300cSkill : Auto HP Regeneration (D-)\u300d\u300cPrice: 15,000 Point \u300d\u300cEffect: Automatically recovers 0.07% of total HP every 180 seconds.\u300dThe skill that I had wished for, the skills related to HP regeneration, stood out.I thought it'd be somewhat okay when I read the description that says it recovers HP automatically, but\u2026After thinking about it, even if it recovers based on total HP, not lost health, it's only about 0.07%, and on top of that, it only regenerates every 180 seconds.'That's not going to be enough.'Considering the HP consumed by Ashen blood, it was clear that it wasn't a very useful skill.Of course, I had the ability to combine the skills, so I roughly committed it to my memory and looked at other skills.\u300cSkill : Moonlight Absorption (E-)\u300d\u300cPrice: 10,000 Point \u300d\u300cEffect: When exposed to moonlight, basic HP regeneration is increased by 100%\u300dSince it's stated as basic HP regeneration, there was no possibility that it could be linked to automatic HP regeneration.Automatic HP regeneration is the ability to recover from skills, and the basic HP regeneration would just be the user's basic HP regeneration ability.Of course, when the ability to maximize the basic HP regeneration appears, its value will increase.\u300cSkill: Sunlight Absorption(E-)\u300d\u300cPrice: 10,000 Point \u300d\u300cEffect: When exposed to sunlight, the basic HP regeneration is increased by 100%\u300dThis skill was no different from the skill Moonlight Absorption.It's just that the condition for skill activation changed from moonlight to sunlight.I thought I could counterbalance the skill activation condition to some extent if I had both, but\u2026In fact, they were abilities that wouldn't activate in places where there's neither sunlight nor moonlight.Should I say that these had quite a number of flaws to utilize both of them?'That's iffy.'When I looked at the skills a bit more, I found two more abilities worth using.\u300cSkill: Overgrowth (C-)\u300d\u300cPrice: 20,000 Point \u300d\u300cEffect: In proportion to the HP stat, all HP regeneration abilities and basic HP are increased by 70%.\u300d\u300cSkill: Call of Blood (C-)\u300d\u300cPrice: 20,000 Point \u300d\u300cEffect: When the user absorbs the blood of a creature they killed, the user's HP and vitality are greatly restored in proportion to the amount of blood absorbed.\u300dThey were quite expensive skills, but their abilities were pretty useful.I stared at the shop window for a while and then came up with the answer.'Then I can just do this.'The answer I just came up with was a fairly simple but reasonable choice.It was to purchase all of these skills.There were three main reasons for making such a choice.\u300cYou've purchased Automatic HP Regeneration (D-)\u300d\u300c15,000 points deducted.\u300dFirst and foremost, I must purchase Automatic HP Regeneration because it recovers my HP even when idle.\u300cYou've purchased Moonlight Absorption (E-)\u300d\u300c10,000 points deducted.\u300d\u300cYou've purchased Sunlight Absorption (E-)\u300d\u300c10,000 points deducted.\u300dSecondly, Moonlight Absorption and Sunlight Absorption were like twins. It's just that their conditions were different.They'd have good compatibility when used for skill combination, so it was clear it'd result in a pretty good ability.\u300cYou've purchased Overgrowth(C-)\u300d\u300c20,000 points deducted.\u300dThe third and last remaining reason is\u2014 though I say it myself \u2014but\u2026\u300cYou've purchased Call of Blood(C-)\u300d\u300c20,000 points deducted.\u300d\u201c\u2026I really did a great job saving up these points, huh.\u201dIt was because I had enough points for myself even if I purchased all these skills.That was the biggest reason.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]\u300cActivating the innate power 'Skill Combination.'\u300d\u300cListing the available skills.\u300d\u300cPlease select combination material from the skill list.\u300dAfter purchasing all the skills, I immediately activated the skill combination.It'd been a while since I did a skill combination, so I was also quite excited.Should I say I'm excited to see what kind of skill I would acquire in this combination?Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksI continued and started the combination with a pleasant sense of excitement.The skills that I started with were 'Sunlight Absorption' and 'Moonlight Absorption'.Both skills only slightly differed in condition, and the skill effect was almost the same.And there was not even the slightest difference in the skill ranks.\u300c The two skills are identical in rank. \u300d\u300c Please select the core skill. \u300dWell, because of that, I was confused about which of the two to choose as the core of skill combination, but\u2026'Is there a point in thinking about this?'As a matter of fact, I thought that no matter which one becomes the core, the outcome wouldn't be very different.After pondering for a while, I finally decided to proceed with a skill combination with Sunlight Absorption as the core.\u300c Skill combination will start with 'Sunlight Absorption' as the core. \u300d\u300c Current probability for a high-tier skill is 100% \u300d\u300c Start the Combination? \u300dMaybe because it's a skill like a twin with almost no difference?\u201cProbability of 100%\u2026 That's incredible.\u201dI never imagined that the skill combination probability would be 100%.\u300c Combination complete. \u300dI proceeded with the skill combination, and the result was revealed.\u300c Skill 'Photosynthesis(C-)' generated. \u300dHowever, contrary to the high-ranked result, the name was quite bizarre.I didn't know how it turned into Photosynthesis when Sunlight Absorption and Moonlight Absorption were combined.'\u2026Photosynthesis, huh.'\u300c Skill \u2013 Photosynthesis (C-) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 When exposed to moonlight or sunlight, the basic HP regeneration rate increases by 200%, and mana can be absorbed through the light.\u300d\u201cIt's not a bad ability.\u201dIt felt like it mixed only the strengths of Moonlight Absorption and Sunlight Absorption, plus additional abilities.However, I had no intention of stopping here, so I then activated Skill Combination again.\u300cActivating the innate power 'Skill Combination.' \u300dI had already thought about which skill to combine in my head.Call of the Blood.I decided to combine Photosynthesis with this skill I just bought from the skill shop.If you asked me why, it's because the ranks of these two skills became the same.\u300c The two skills are identical in rank. \u300d\u300c Please select the core skill. \u300d'The rank of skills used for combination are identical, so I can decide the core for the combination.'To be frank, Photosynthesis is a good skill, but it doesn't suit me.I thought the ability to kill living things and absorb their blood suited me more, like Call of the Blood.And in the end, I narrowed my choice down to maximizing the Call of Blood by using Photosynthesis as a sacrifice.\u300c Skill combination will start with 'Call of the blood' as the core. \u300d\u300c Current probability for a high-tier skill is 70% \u300d\u300c Start the Combination? \u300dWithout further ado, I pressed confirm.\u300c Combination complete. \u300dAnd\u2026\u300c Skill 'Blood-red Contract(C-)' generated. \u300dI frowned after looking at the message that popped up.'It failed.'The probability of Skill Combination decided whether it'll result in a higher rank skill or not.However, in this combination, it didn't result in a higher rank skill, so it meant that it failed.When I looked at the skill description, the thought that I failed grew bigger.\u300c Skill \u2013 Blood-red Contract (C-) \u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300c Effect \u2013 Vitality, HP, and mana can be extracted from the blood of living things, and this only applies to living things that the user killed.\u300dThere was even a phrase saying that mana can now be extracted, but all the advantages of Photosynthesis had disappeared.In a nutshell, this skill is no different from failure.\u201cWell, it doesn't matter, I guess.\u201dHowever\u2026\u300cYou've purchased Call of Blood(C-)\u300d\u300c20,000 points deducted.\u300dA single failure was just good enough to be used as a stepping stone for success.After purchasing the same skill from the skill shop, I immediately activated Skill Combination and selected the Blood-red Contract and Call of Blood.\u300c The two skills are identical in rank. \u300d\u300c Please select the core skill. \u300dThe ability to be the core of skill combination was the Call of the Blood this time again.\u300c Skill combination will start with 'Call of the Blood' as the core. \u300d\u300c Current probability for a high-tier skill is 98% \u300d\u300c Start the Combination? \u300dThe probability of skill combination has increased a lot.I was able to realize quickly that the cause was none other than the 'Blood-red Contract'.Due to failing Skill Combination once, it became a slightly better rip-off skill for the Call of Blood.And thanks to that, the compatibility with the current Call of Blood has improved considerably in skill combination.'That's a surprise. The failure of Skill Combination can also work well like this, I see.'This was the first time I failed to combine skills, so I wasn't feeling very good, but I benefited from it unexpectedly.\u300c Combination complete. \u300dAnd\u2014\u300c A new skill is being generated\u2026! \u300dI couldn't help but open my eyes wide at the system message that appeared.As there's a proverb that goes\u2014 failure is but a stepping stone to success.\u300c Skill 'Truth-seeker of Blood(B)' generated. \u300dThe Skill Combination that followed after one failure had come up with a really successful result.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If I randomly combined skills that weren't even proper, I'd be in trouble.Even more, I had a history of mixing skills randomly and acquiring a skill that was basically pointless.It was then\u2014'\u2026Come to think of it, it's not that I don't have the skills to combine at all.'Suddenly, I thought of 'Strengthened Eyes(E-)', a skill I neglected after combining.It was a skill with low rank, and the effect was lame, so I didn't really care about it.However, since then, I'd gathered enough abilities to attempt the combination, such as 'Eye of Truth' or 'Mind's Eye'.\u201cHm\u2026\u201dBut, to blindly combine the skills, the Eye of Truth and Mind's Eye were quite valuable.The Mind's Eye allows the user to perceive everything around the user, and the Eye of Truth allows the user to see through lies and information.'It's a gamble.'I knew it.That this is actually a gamble among gambles that shouldn't be done.But at the same time, I was well aware of the value of the success of this combination.As I continued to ponder, I suddenly thought of a great idea.\u201cShop.\u201dAs soon as I opened the shop window, I went into the skill shop and browsed through the skills that were being sold.And-.\u300cSkill: Mind's Eye(F)\u300d\u300cPrice: 10,000 Point \u300d\u300cEffect: Perhaps you might start feeling things that you can't see..\u300d\u201cI didn't expect for this to be here.\u201dSoon, I was able to find out that the Mind's Eye was on sale.'Of course, the rank was lower than I thought, though\u2026'In the battle with Namgung hyuk, I figured out its usage while frantically raising the Proficiency of Mind's Eye.Even if it was an F- rank skill, I was confident to instantly raise it into a higher-rank skill.\u300cActivating the innate power 'Skill Combination.' \u300dI immediately selected Mind's Eye and Strengthened Eyes and combined them.Obviously, Mind's Eye had a higher skill rank, so the Strengthened Eyes was pushed out of the core of Skill CombinationAnd just like that, the Skill Combination proceeded with Mind's Eye as the core.\u300c Skill combination complete. \u300d\u300c Skill 'Mana Eyes()' generated. \u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. ThanksThe Strengthened Eyes and Mind's Eye disappeared, and Mana resided in my eyes anew.'I think I can tell what kind of ability this is without even having to read the skill description.'Basically, it can be used like Mind's Eye, but the ability to detect Mana has been drastically improved.Should I say that it has mana detection that's a few times better than the kind that relies on the mana circuit?Even if I used this as it is, it's an ability that's close to the higher tier than the Mind's Eye skill, but it felt lacking by a step.Instinct whispered to me like a demon.That a proper skill would be born only when the Eye of Truth is also combined.A truly splendid skill, that I wouldn't be disappointed with.\u300cSkill 'Sixth Sense' is strongly activated.\u300dAs if to support that thought, a phrase that even the Sixth Sense was activated popped up.Then I activated the Skill Combination, and soon the skill was combined.\u300c Skill combination complete. \u300dAnd\u2014\u300c A new skill is being generated. \u300dAs if that intuition wasn't wrong, the skill generated afterward was a result beyond my imagination.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Soon, I opened my eyes wide as I saw the system message that appeared in front of me.\u300c Skill 'Fire Dragon's Eyes()' generated. \u300dFire Dragon's Eyes.The grand name was one thing; its rank was quite high.Its rank could be one of the highest among my current skills.'To think everything worked out well like this.'I was able to reach this point thanks to not failing a single Skill Combination.\u300cSkill \u2013 Fire Dragon's Eyes()\u300d\u300c Proficiency \u2013 0% \u300d\u300cEffect \u2013 The power of Fire Dragon dwells in the eyes, allowing the user to see the things that they normally can't see.\u300d\u300cDetailed Effect \u2013 Through the Dragon's Eyes, you can see the information of things, and it becomes possible to determine whether your opponent is lying or not.\u300dThere were no flaws in the skill effects, and only the strengths were kept intact.I suppose the only definition that changed is that the power of the Fire Dragon dwells in the eyes.'The power of Fire Dragon, huh.'It was amazing in many ways, but it was difficult to tell the difference only with the changed definition.'Still, some things must have changed or improved.'Since the rank had risen this much, it must be so.Whatever it may be, there must be some strengths, so I immediately activated the Fire Dragon's Eyes.\u300cActivating the skill 'Fire Dragon's Eyes()'\u300dIt was none other than to confirm the ability inherited from the Eye of Truth to grasp the information of things.There may be some changes in this ability or such, so I planned to check it out carefully.And\u2014\u201cWhat in the world is this\u2026?\u201dSoon I was able to understand the true meaning of the sentence of Fire Dragon's Eyes that said, 'Allowing the users to see the things they normally can't see.'\u300cHeavenly Blood Demonic Sword \u300dFrom an item that was stolen from Kim Seungjun before and had now become my favorite sword.\u300c\u2026When a user who has reached the level of Sword Flame activates the exclusive effect, Blood Ki, to the maximum, the true ability will be unlocked.\u300dA phrase that I had never seen before was revealed.It was an ability that was practically useless other than by directly checking the item, but\u2026Now, not only could it completely check the item performance, but it could also check the new phrases.'What the\u2026'I was dumbfounded.I thought it'd have been slightly enhanced by combining the Mind's Eye and Eye of Truth.But I didn't expect it to evolve into such a useful skill.And when I opened the item description window directly, not from the skill, it became clearer.'The phrase that can be seen through the Fire Dragon's Eyes doesn't appear in the item description window.'Realizing that fact, I then checked all the other items as well.\u300cThe Vampire Count's Old Tailcoat \u300dThe hidden phrases were everywhere.\u300c\u2026When the user consumes blood to form a shield, additional toughness is added to the shield.\u300dThere were miscellaneous facts that I didn't know well at first.\u300c Boots of Swiftness \u300dAnd new phrases were discovered in items I didn't care much about.\u300c\u2026When the user applies Mana on the boots, the duration of Instantaneous Acceleration is slightly increased.\u300dIt was also content that would be helpful even a little when used in battle.Well, other items didn't really display any special phrase, and it wasn't at the level that it'd be helpful in battle.But even so, it was by no means negligible.After looking through this and that, I soon realized one thing.This Fire Dragon's Eyes was much better than I thought, and its true value hadn't yet been fully revealed.The Eye of Truth skill, which wasn't even used properly, was inherited and strengthened to this point.How strong would Mind's Eyes' inherited abilities have become if I directly checked it in battle?Reaching that point, I couldn't help but raise the corners of my lips even if I tried not to.In the end, instead of thinking about it, I immediately activated the command.\u300cWill you attempt the trial of the 11th floor?\u300dWithout considering any other options, I clicked accept to that question.And soon, I entered the portal that appeared in the center of the waiting room.\u300c Entering Tower of Trials floor 11. \u300d\u300c Difficulty \u2013 Hard \u300d\u300c The objective of the following trial is 'Proving of the spirit'. \u300d\u300c We wish the challenger a satisfactory ending to their choice. \u300dThe two new skills that have appeared, Truth-seeker of Blood and the Fire Dragon's Eyes.I'll soon be able to see their true value even if I don't want to know it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Since you came this far on your own. You agreed that you'd be tested by the Gods even if you're nothing but an adventurer, so you'll have to fully bear the consequences.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201dLooks like there was a behind story on this 11th-floor stage.An adventurer entered the temple of proof, thinking he'd receive the Trial by God without knowing his place.And because of that, he had to break through the seven hurdles and clear the Trial of God.That was the situation I was in.'It wouldn't be Murim or Earth. It should be a story from another dimension.'It must be so since there are many interesting fantasy worlds, such as Callian or Ares.Now that I knew what the story was, there was nothing more that I had to understand.\u201cSo, how do I get through the first hurdle?\u201d\u201cDo you not even know the law of trials led by the seven gods of Ares?\u201d\u201cNot all adventurers would be ignorant, but\u2026 you do seem like one.\u201d\u201c\u2026You're right.\u201dThe middle-aged priest made sarcastic remarks at me as though he was dumbfounded, but\u2026Aside from his confusion, I was neither a challenger from Ares nor an adventurer who actually came to this temple where this story has happened.Therefore, of course, there was no way that I'd hesitate to ask questions.'Other than that, so this is the Ares dimension, huh.'I remembered the challenger from another world I met while climbing the tower.That damned black knight who appeared on the 5th floor and almost drove me to death flashed through my head.I heard that most of Ares' challengers value chivalry and are composed of a unified nation.Aside from that characteristic, I was currently doing a trial that had nothing to do with knights.\u201cI guess I can't help it. Let me explain.\u201dWhile thinking about this and that, the middle-aged priest started his explanation.\u201cThe trials conducted in the Temple of Proof are simple.\u201dI immediately pushed aside my thoughts and focused on the middle-aged priest's words.\u201cProof of the body, proof of the belief, proof of the spirit.\u201d\u201cIt starts with proof of the body and eventually goes to the most difficult one, proof of the spirit.\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u201cBreaking through the hurdle is simple. There'll be a high priest in each of the trial rooms, so do whatever it takes, either persuade them or kill them and move on to the next room.\u201d\u201cBut that wouldn't make it a trial.\u201dIt's no different from me having to move on to the next room at will.But then I wondered if that does anything or even counted as passing through the hurdle, but.\u201cHow could an ignorant person like you understand the will of God?\u201d\u201cProving literally means proving. Each path you choose is proof.\u201d\u201cIn a nutshell, it doesn't matter what I do or how I break through the hurdle.\u201d\u201cWell, something like that. So, stop asking silly questions and come at me.\u201dI paused for a moment at what the middle-aged priest said while taking a stance of Kenp\u014d.But soon, I looked into the eyes of the middle-aged priest and understood the true meaning.He said it's a proving of the body\u2026But to think that it's this kind of proving.\u201cThe first hurdle begins now.\u201dHe talked as if telling me to come at him if I had the courage to do so, but\u2026When I actually heard that, I couldn't help but smile in a sardonic way.I fought with a knight of Ares and with the elders of Murim. I repeatedly fought until I almost died.And what he presents as proof of the body is just a battle with a priest?\u201cThen here I go.\u201dAt this point, it was no different from an easy difficulty rather than a hard difficulty.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Unexpectedly, the middle-aged priest wasn't weak\u2014 he was quite strong.Should I say that he's as strong as the challengers in the earth dimension who achieved the qualification as a pioneer in the hard difficulty?I never imagined that a priest who served God would be such a strong master of a Kenp\u014d.But what's unexpected remains unexpected, and a trial is a trial.Bang!While dodging the Kenp\u014d of the middle-aged priest as if observing him, I immediately kicked him and rammed him into the wall.\u201cKuhugh!\u201dThe middle-aged priest vomited blood as he slammed into the wall, then fell to the floor.Looking at him wriggling intermittently, it seemed that he still had consciousness, but\u2026I thought that the battle would be practically impossible now.\u201cThank you for the explanation.\u201dI finally thanked the middle-aged priest and thrust the sword into his body.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the priest 'Johann'.\u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 5.8% \u300dBecause he was a stronger opponent than I expected, the proficiency I gained was pretty sweet.'If the proficiency increases like this two more times, the rank of Necromancy would go up too.'It was then that I felt somewhat satisfied inside.\u300c Administrator 'Priest of Seven Gods' is appalled by your shocking behavior that they happened to come upon.\u300dSuch a message came up, conveying someone's shocked feelings towards me.That wasn't the end of it.\u300c Administrator 'God-slaying Swordsman' nods at your cold-blooded action.\u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u300c Administrator 'The Hero of the Collapsed World' looks at you and praises you for being a pretty interesting fellow.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Seeker of Divinity' tells you not to worry, as you are proceeding with proving yourself properly.\u300dOut of nowhere, some administrators even sent me a message to express their feelings.Never before had this many administrators tagged along with me, even in the public area.It was refreshing to see so many administrators sending messages to me.Judging by the names of the administrators, it seems that they were interested because the trial I'm undergoing has something to do with 'God', or because it's related to someone from Ares dimension.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is perplexed to see you undergoing trials without any warning.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' feels disappointed as you entered the trial without saying anything.\u300dAfter some time passed, the two managers who had made a contract with me also arrived quickly, probably through word of mouth.They seemed to be bummed that they couldn't spectate right away as I entered the trial immediately without saying a thing, mentioning things like they were perplexed or disappointed, but\u2014'I can't help it since I don't have any means to contact the administrators.'I smiled bitterly at that and searched the belongings of the middle-aged priest, Johann.\u300c Administrator 'Priest of Seven Gods' is watching your actions without saying a word.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'The Hero of the Collapsed World' admires your greed.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'God-slaying Swordsman' nods as though they understand all of your actions.\u300dPerhaps it felt quite greedy. It evoked messages from administrators.Of course, I didn't care whether it did feel greedy or not and took out the small mirror from Johann's body.I could feel unknown energy from the small mirror, the only thing he had on him.'It's an item.'And.\u300c Activating the skill 'Fire Dragon's Eyes'. \u300dI immediately used Fire Dragon's Eyes to inspect what kind of item this small mirror was.\u300cMirror with the Divinity of the High Priest\u300d\u300cRank: C+\u300d\u300cThe mirror that high priest 'Johann' placed his divine power without missing a single day.\u300d\u300cYou can spread a divine shield only once by consuming the divine power towards the God of Proof.\u300d\u300cWhen you spread the divine shield, mind contamination is also restored to some extent.\u300dAfter that, there was a phrase revealed through the Fire Dragon's Eyes.\u300c\u2026Perhaps the divine power of the God of Proof filled in the mirror may lead the bearer to prove their fate by themselves.\u300dIt was none other than just a single-use shield item.'I didn't understand what the phrase meant that says the bearer to prove their fate by themselves, too.'It's not like it can certainly allow me to prove my fate. It's uncertain.The existence of its hidden phrase didn't make any difference, so I got up from my seat after putting away the mirror filled with the divinity.'I wish there were more proofs of the body.'While thinking nonsense, I opened the door and walked to the second hurdle.A second hurdle appeared when I opened the door at the end of the narrow hallway that only one person could barely walk through.It was still a square-shaped room, but there was no dryness, nothing like the previous room.The space where the second hurdle existed was a room with a bizarre sight\u2014 a broken mirror was attached to the wall.'I wonder what in the world the God of Proof is to have this many mirrors.'It was then\u2014\u201c\u2026To think that a nameless adventurer from outside would reach up to here.\u201dAt the second hurdle, the blonde beauty sitting quietly in the middle of the room opened her eyes and muttered so.\u201cIt seems that Johann is no longer able to be in service.\u201d\u201cAre you the priest of the second hurdle?\u201d\u201cYes indeed, adventurer. I'm the priest of the second hurdle.\u201d\u201cThe proof of the body didn't end with the fight with Johann.\u201d\u201cThen that means this must be the proof of the body again.\u201d\u201cCorrect. So there's nothing more to talk about.\u201dShe answered unaffectedly, got up from her seat, and fluttered her nun's habit.\u201cI'm high priest Jane. Nice to meet you.\u201dContrary to Johann, who was gloomy, she had a cheerful atmosphere.\u201cI'm Hang Sungyeun.\u201dI wondered how important it would be to say my name in the midst of trials when I'm in a world of trials, but when I saw Jane's eyes demanding my name, I answered flatly.\u201cYou have no intention of putting any mercy in your hands, are you?\u201d\u201cNone at all. I'll kill you and move on.\u201d\u201cI expected it from the moment Johann's presence disappeared, but you're pretty aggressive, huh.\u201dIt's true that I'm aggressive, but I can't just wing it when it's a trial and all.There would be additional breakthrough rewards the more I certainly do things. It was too good to give up those.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is satisfied with your sobriety.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' smiles and says that such a thing is your charm.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'The Hero of the Collapsed World' is advising you to beware of those crazy bitches.\u300dAnd to go with killing, the rise in proficiency of Necromancy is also quite high.\u201cAre you thinking of having me or something like that?\u201dThe administrators observing me reacted immediately to what Jane spitted out while grinning.\u300c Administrator 'The Hero of the Collapsed World' waits patiently for your answer.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' looks at you with squinted eyes.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' is restless at questions she couldn't have imagined.\u300dJane throwing this kind of question was also shocking, but the response from the administrators was also quite something.Even White Crane Sword Saint was bewildered to the point that she even sent a message saying that she was restless.But it was no different for me, so I immediately answered her question with a sense of perplexity.\u201c\u2026I don't have such a disgusting hobby, you see.\u201d\u201cAhaha, that's a huge relief.\u201dAnd at the same time as her words ended, messages from administrators flooded in.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' strongly agrees with Jane.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' is sending trust to you, saying that she had believed in you.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Seeker of Divinity' fascinatingly observes your choices.\u300dI skimmed those messages, then turned my attention away and looked at Jane.\u201cMoreover, why are you asking that when we're in a temple? Who in the world would do such a thing?\u201d\u201cThere is. People like you who come in occasionally do.\u201d\u201c\u2026Ah, Ok. I see.\u201d\u201cYou're pretty innocent for an adventurer. Judging from the fact that you even beat Johann, you've got good skills and looking at you being merciless, you seem to have spent some time on the battlefield.\u201d\u201cI didn't expect that the adventurer who came this far would look like someone out of a fairy tale.\u201dAn adventurer who says he'd kill someone without hesitation is like someone out of a fairy tale.'It's a crazy world, for real.'The thought that the Earth dimension is at least quite normal is firmly engraved in my head.\u201cLet's end the chatter here.\u201dWith those words as an end, she pulled out her sword from the scabbard on her waist.And\u2014\u201cThe second hurdle begins now.\u201dThe moment when pure white Sword Ki erupted from her rapier.I immediately felt the corners of my lips, that weren't budging an inch, rise straight up regardless of my will.It was a smile that came from the expectation that I might be able to learn a new type of Sword Ki skill after a long time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That's why you said you'd take the trial of the God of Proof. Interesting.\u201dI wasn't from a fallen noble family or anything, but I decided to stay silent for now.And I don't have to say anything back since the other person is misunderstanding it, too.\u201cIs it that surprising to you that I'm using an Aura when you're using one too?\u201d\u201cIt's because you're an adventurer, and I'm a high priest.\u201dShe said so as if there was a gap of status that couldn't be filled between the two.\u201cAnd technically speaking, I'm not wielding the Aura.\u201d\u201cI just manifested the divine power given by the God of Proof with power.\u201d\u201cSo you mean it's not the official way of using the Aura.\u201d\u201cWell, I guess you could put it that way. It's some sort of an expedient.\u201dIn short, it meant that it's the same as the Sword Ki I used before I manifested the Sword Ki by myself.\u201cAhh\u2026\u201dTo that, I had no choice but to look at her with massive disappointment.It was a pity that I had nothing to learn and that the sword Ki she had wasn't even skill, not allowing any possibility to absorb it.The fact that I had nothing to learn and the fact that there was no possibility to even absorb her Sword Ki as it's not skill was disappointing.Should I say it felt like a single drop of water falling into the ground while feeling a burning thirst soaked right away?However\u2014Instead of being frustrated by that fact, I used my disappointment as nourishment and adjusted my grip on the sword.And at the same time, I looked at Jane catching her breath and asked her a question.\u201cThere's something that I want to ask.\u201d\u201cWas that the end of the proof of the body?\u201d\u201c\u2026Do you think you've already won? Even if I'm not a formal Aura user, my skills are as good as one, you see?\u201d\u201cSo you're not going to tell me?\u201d\u201cI wonder\u2026 I don't know. If you want to know, try defeating me fair and square like a formal Aura user, and then perhaps I might tell you.\u201dJudging from her sullen tone, she must've thought that I was looking down on her.She must've even thought she was despised for not being a formal Aura user.Of course, she wasn't wrong that I thought I won, but I have never despised her for not being a formal Aura user.But I shone my eyes at the condition she attached at the end of her sentence rather than her being angry.\u201cI don't think that's enough. If I win, tell me what other proof will be there ahead of me.\u201d\u201cHah! I'll do that if you win, adventurer. But isn't it too early to think that you've won?\u201dAs soon as I saw the veins rising up on Jane's fine forehead, I smiled softly.\u201cThat's something we'll find out soon.\u201dAnd\u2014With those words, I immediately kicked off and rushed to Jane.Clang! Claaang! Claaaaaaaang!The battle with Jane was getting far longer than I expected.At some point, I didn't even know how much time had passed.The cause of this long battle was because of the divine power that Jane had in her body.Perhaps claiming that she was a priest wasn't entirely wrong. She was constantly replenishing her stamina, recovering her wounds through divine power, and holding out against me.On top of that, her physical ability was pretty high, so she wasn't an opponent I could defeat without any damage.But soon, while fighting with Jane, I noticed she had less combat experience than I thought.Should I say it seemed like she had no experience in having a long fight against a strong opponent?It looked like she had never sparred with someone like me who could tenaciously keep up with her.'Then I'll have to make use of that too.'For that, I slowly loosened the strength of my right hand holding the Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword and started pretending to be a little exhausted on purpose.To prevent Jane from thinking that this was acting, I purposely loosened concentration on my eyes, clenched my teeth, and forcefully swung my sword.At that very moment, Jane took the bait.Claaaaaang!With the Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword that was deliberately wielded poorly, Jane made a big move and blew my sword away from my hands.And soon, her face began to turn bright as though she had just won.\u300c Activating the power 'Iron-blooded Sword.' \u300dWithout noticing that it was the result of my plan.As soon as the Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword disappeared, I immediately summoned the Iron-blooded Sword in my right hand.Then, an antique-looking Iron-blooded Sword tinged with frost was attached to my empty right hand.At the same time, a look of bewilderment fell on Jane's face, which had guaranteed her victory.However, Jane, who struck my sword with a huge movement, wasn't yet given freedom of action.I used that moment to strongly parry the rapier on Jane's hand in reverse.Kaaang![Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]\u201cI won.\u201d\u201cN-No\u2026 How did it turn like this\u2026\u201d\u201cJust think of it as your lack of practical experience.\u201dAt that, Jane opened her mouth as though it made her go off the deep end.\u201cLack of practical experience, my ass\u2026! Don't you think it's the adventurer that's strange when I'm recovering several times with divine power!?\u201d\u300c Administrator 'God-slaying Swordsman' says, now that you mention it. She's right.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'The Hero of the Collapsed World' affirms the priest's words, saying that what she's saying isn't entirely wrong.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Seeker of Divinity' sympathizes with Priest Jane's anger and tells you that you're the strange one.\u300d\u201cDoesn't the fact that you've never competed with such an opponent equate to your lack of practical experience?\u201d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' is inflated with pride and says this is her contractor.\u300dCome and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' scoffs at a woman saying why is an administrator who signed the second contract is the one acting pompous.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Seeker of Divinity' feels interest and pleasure in your sophistry and is satisfied.\u300d\u201cWhat kind of logic is that\u2026?\u201d\u201cEither way, I won.\u201d\u201cThat's\u2026 true.\u201d\u201cThen let me know what you promised.\u201dOf course, Jane could say no, but I thought she wasn't a person to do so.Even if she doesn't, it's just a matter of where I can finish her off and move on to the next hurdle.But Jane didn't bother to say no, and immediately let out a deep sigh, and she began to explain.\u201cThere are now two proofs of the body left, and the proof of the belief will begin at the fifth hurdle and will end at the sixth.\u201d\u201cThen do you mean that the proof of the spirit is only in the seventh hurdle?\u201d\u201cBut you might wanna consider giving up once before trying the seventh hurdle.\u201d\u201cNo one has ever passed the seventh hurdle, you see. Everyone who went through it had gone insane or died bleeding all over their body.\u201dI immediately activated the Fire Dragon's Eyes to check if what she was saying was true, but.\u300cThe skill 'Fire Dragon's Eyes' detects that there are no lies in the words of the opponent.\u300dJane was just relaying only the facts to me.\u201cThen do you know the content of the proofs that'll happen onwards\u2026\u201d\u201cI don't know about that either.\u201d\u300cThe skill 'Fire Dragon's Eyes' detects that there are no lies in the words of the opponent.\u300dI realized this only after asking Jane this and that through the Fire dragon's eyes.Those in charge of each proof barely interact with each other, and only properly know about the proof they're in charge of.At that, with a sigh, I picked up the Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword that had fallen in the room and deactivated the Iron-blooded Sword.Come to think of it, even though it had been a while since I acquired the Iron-blooded Sword, I haven't been using it properly.'The performance of the Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword is too good, so I can't really find a situation to use it.'Originally, I thought that the sword I was using would be destroyed or disappear soon.But as I was using it, I couldn't really use the power that much because perhaps the Heavenly Blood Demonic Sword was better than I had imagined.At this point, I felt like I couldn't even make use of the power properly.I thought of maybe learning dual wielding of a sword after completing the trial on the 11th floor, and soon looked at Jane.\u201cI'll be over soon, huh. My last words are\u2026 well. It's been a while since I had a good fight. That's about it.\u201dShe didn't look like someone who knew she was going to die soon.\u201c\u2026Aren't you scared of dying?\u201dAfter I killed Jane, I'd absorb her soul.Nevertheless, Jane didn't seem too afraid.When I wondered why and asked her, Jane answered calmly.\u201cBecause the soul of a high priest is bound to God.\u201d\u201cEven if I die, I'll just be returning to the side of God.\u201d\u201cSo that's the reason why you don't have any fear of death.\u201d\u201cI may look like this, but I'm a priest who dedicated everything to God in my own way, so I'm free from all the worldly desires.\u201dI didn't ask further if she really didn't have any regrets and if it was okay for her to die like this.Anyway, I was longing for growth, and she wouldn't feel devastated even if she died.Knowing that asking more like this would just be a disgusting act, I silently swung my sword.Slaaaaash!\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the priest 'Jane'.\u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 8.8% \u300dIt's been a while since I've felt my mind becoming a bit dull.We fought properly, knowing that we were going to die, and Jane was defeated and lost her life as a result.It was a battle that risked life. If I had been weaker, it would've been me who died, not her.That's all, and in reality, she's a person that I wouldn't be able to remember once I overcame the trial.And yet, currently, I was feeling some kind of guilt for killing her.For an instant, I felt a chill seep through my body.I once swore to myself.Which was, to climb the tower, I'd kill everyone who tried to kill me.In doing so, I'd climb this tower without escaping from fighting and abandoning my humanity.However, that was to preserve the minimum amount of humanity, and I didn't hesitate to kill people like this.Was I confused about my feelings this much because she didn't have any malice towards me unlike the people I've met so far?However, Johann, whom I encountered at the first gate, was also similar if that's the case.He didn't have much malice towards me. He just quibbled about the trial.Even when killing him and taking the items from his pocket, I had no other feelings except for being a little sorry.For the first time, I began to feel fear.What will happen if this feeling doesn't end with a simple whim but also overlaps with self-contradiction?The feeling of being defeated by Namgung hyuk was like firewood intensifying the fire called longing for growth.But it'd be the worst if this precarious feeling blocks that longing and takes away my will.As I got to that thought, I felt my hair rising and frowned.\u201cNo wonder why it's called the proof of the spirit\u2026 It's actually making me think about the subject of the trial.\u201dPerhaps this trial itself might have this kind of tendency.This space was prepared by the tower, and at the same time it was called a trial of the gods.There may be a factor that influences me without affecting the mana resistance and forceful breakthrough.I drove that fact in my head as though imprinting it, and immediately left the room and walked to the next hurdle.Unlike a while ago, there were broken pieces of glass attached to the hallway connecting the room.And it increased in numbers as I got closer to the next hurdle, till it looked like a single broken window.Should I say it connected and continueed as if a new mirror was being completed from the pieces of glass?That feeling became certain as soon as I entered the room where the third hurdle was.The walls, ceilings, and floors were lined with pieces of glass like broken mirrors.In the center of that foreign room was a priest with his eyes closed and a scabbard in his left hand.He was a man of great size, and his stout physique was conspicuous even from the outside of his fluttering robes.\u201c\u2026An adventurer who can truly wield the laws of the invisible world, I see.\u201dHe murmured so with his eyes closed, then raised his right hand and placed his hand on the handle of his sword.And at the same time.\u300c Administrator 'God-slaying Swordsman' tells you that you should be careful now.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' says he uses a genuine Sword Ki, not a fabricated one.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is sending a small admiration, saying as expected from a priest who serves the God of Proof.\u300dWhile messages were flooding in from the administrators, the man grabbed the handle of the sword and\u2014\u201cI'm the one who'll become a sword that the God of Proof will wield, Resillian.\u201dSoon he gradually opened his eyes, slowly pulling out a straight sword from his scabbard.Then, as Resillian held the sword fully in his right hand, flames erupted from the blade.It was an imperfect flame that seemed like it could be extinguished by a gust of wind.However\u2014\u201cProve your mastery of arms here.\u201dIt was a technique that had to be acknowledged, even imperfect.\u201cSword Flame\u2026\u201dThe worst technique that existed only to devour the Sword Ki appeared in front of me again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thanks to that, you would've been able to wield the law that can't be seen.\u201dA law that can't be seen?I frowned at that foolish word and opened my mouth.\u201cI'm not so sure what that invisible law means.\u201dOnly then did Resillian nod his head as though he had realized that he had misunderstood something.\u201c\u2026It was my misunderstanding. You don't seem to be able to use the Sword Flame yet.\u201dAt that the moment, when I was about to ask him what the invisible law was\u2026Martial arts are the proof of life and the only path to reaching God.Resillian slowly raised the sword imbued with Sword Flame and said so, and\u2014\u201cYou'll have to realize how great the path you're walking is.\u201dSoon, his eyes flashed while warning me with a voice full of vigor.And\u2014\u201cOtherwise, you'll die at the third hurdle without being able to do anything.\u201dAt the same time, Resillian swung his sword like lightning and rushed in.\u300c Activating the skill 'Wind's Blessing.' \u300d\u300c All speeds increased by 70%. \u300d\u300c Number of stacks \u2013 7/7 \u300dAt that, I rushed in the same direction, using all the acceleration abilities I could use right away.\u300c Activating the skill 'Instant Acceleration.'\u300dIt was the beginning of the third hurdle.Clalalalang!The Sword Ki and the Sword Flame clashed against each other, and the white flame of the sword destroyed the Sword Ki.At that, I couldn't help but think that the Sword Flame is truly an overpowered ability.I didn't understand how it easily destroys the Sword Ki since it's not like its physical power became stronger.At least, since it's an incomplete Sword Flame, I could endure for a while, and exchange blows.If Resillian had been able to wield the perfect Sword Flame, I would not have been able to fight properly.Claaaang!After exchanging an attack once, we entered a calm state.Using the Wind's Blessing, I was accelerating to a realm that even Resillian, wielding the Sword Flame, couldn't keep up with.In short, we were in a difficult situation to settle this duel.While I sharpened my mana and put my brain to work.\u201cWielding things that are invisible to make a sword that cuts through heaven and earth.\u201dResillian spoke out of nowhere as if he was going to help me.\u201cBy doing so, it creates a fictitious blade called Aura with absolute physical power.\u201dBefore I could even question him for those words, Resillian swung his Sword.And adjusting to that, I instinctively fired a slash with my Lightning Sword Ki.And\u2026..Kaboom!\u201cThat's a fancy aura. It's been a long time since I've experienced an aura that utilizes lightning, so my eyes are in delight.\u201dResillian looked at me while maintaining a stance that unleashed a slash.He was a stronger opponent than I had imagined.I was unleashing the Sword Ki through the skill Lightning Sword Ki, but\u2014Resillian casually deflected the Sword Ki from a distance, as if it was the basics of the basics.'The world that we're perceiving must be different.'On top of that, the words he threw during the battle affected me more seriously.Just like throwing a stone into a calm water surface and causing a big ripple.Every time I heard his explanation that felt like nonsense, my mana squirmed and swayed.I clearly felt it was a change for the good, not the bad.On that, I had no choice but to speak to Resillian with strong doubts.\u201cWhy are you throwing out words that might give me enlightenment like that?\u201dThe third hurdle is the proving of the body, and defeat means death.However, Resillian gave me good words as if he wanted me to grow.I had strong doubts about that fact, and when I asked, Resillian answered with a smirk.\u201cThat's because I want to see you prove it.\u201d\u201cThe important thing in the path of martial arts is to prove each other's martial arts and exchange them.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2026\u201d\u201cI want to see the martial arts you will prove. That's all.\u201d\u201cEven if nothing will remain when you die\u2026 can you really do that?\u201d\u201cIsn't it obvious? That's the path and proof of martial arts.\u201dI felt a hot gaze as if there was a flame in Resillian's eyes.\u201cProve the body, Prove the belief, and prove the spirit.\u201dI didn't like it.\u201cBut what's at the end is the proof of martial arts.\u201dThe tip of my sword was shaking.\u201cYou can't prove your martial arts properly yet.\u201dIt'd be better if he treated me with malicious intentions.\u201cTherefore, I'll let you prove everything about yourself right here.\u201dI could see why I felt guilty for killing Jane on the second hurdle.She didn't approach me with malice, and she came only to provide me with the hurdle.It was the same for Resillian.He was inducing growth in the hope that I'd properly prove my martial arts.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

Death is closer.\u201dResillian looked straight at me and continued his words slowly.\u201cSome people fail to prove their martial arts, and some succeed in proving their martial arts.\u201dHe said it with a determined face that didn't suit him, as if it were the truth of this world.\u201cProving is struggle and survival. Hesitation is nothing but a luxury.\u201dWith that phrase, I could hold on to my mind breaking down.This fight wasn't just a fight against each other but a duel and struggle for survival.Since when was it possible for a weak bastard like me to fight with hesitation while dividing good and evil?I admitted it.I almost paid the price for climbing the tower with a half-assed determination just now.However, the moment I realized this fact, I immediately gave up my foolish attitude.\u201cDon't dismiss the proving of a martial artist as a frivolous murder.\u201dIt's natural to fight each other and win, and it's the process of building one's own life.There was no right for me to classify it as a flow of good and evil.Even if that's the path that I'm on myself.When I started to think so, the sword that had been shaking at some point stopped shaking.Resillian looked at me as if he was satisfied with that and then smiled broadly.\u201cYeah\u2026 just like that, you just have to slowly build up your belief.\u201dBefore I knew it, my heart turned to steel as though it had never been shaken.\u300c Administrator 'The Hero of the Collapsed World' laughs loudly as he senses that your spirit has grown. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' smiles happily that you've entered the path of martial arts. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is confident that you've set a new direction for growth and has high expectations of you. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'Seeker of Divinity' is pleased with the birth of a new belief and eagerly watches you. \u300dIs this the belief held by those who walk the path of martial arts?\u201cNow, the time for proving has come. Adventurer.\u201dI wasn't sure, but one thing was clear now.That is, through the fight with Resillian, I needed to learn the technique called Sword Flame.I held my breath while holding the sword, and immediately began to circulate mana through my body.And\u2014\u201cProve your life through the martial arts you have.\u201dSoon, I stretched out my foot, changing my momentum like steel.-Do you think you'll be able to fully wield Sword ki when you don't even know what true martial arts are?For a moment, what Namgung Hyuk said ran through my mind.Why did Namgung Hyuk say that the powers, skills, or innate abilities don't match up to martial arts?Martial arts simply has abilities that are no different from skills.It's nothing more than having a systematic structure by circulating mana throughout the body and putting energy into the sword.Nevertheless, Namgung Hyuk despised skills and called them fake abilities.-A fake Sword Ki won't be able to match the true Sword Ki.He even said that the Sword Ki used through power is inferior to the Sword Ki learned through enlightenment.Considering that those words are true to some extent, the things that Namgung Hyuk said aren't meaningless at all.It must've been because there was something in the martial arts that was enough for him to despise skills.-Wielding things that are invisible to make a sword that cuts through heaven and earth.Resillian told me that the invisible thing would form the Sword Ki.Then I wondered if that invisible thing meant mana.However, if it was just simply possessing mana and wielding it normally, neither Namgung Hyuk nor Resillian would've said this to me.-By doing so, it creates a fictitious blade called Aura with absolute physical power.Resillian addressed the Sword Ki that is used by achieving the Body and Sword as One, as an absolute physical power.Isn't Sword Ki just treating the sword as if it were your body and using it just like strengthening your body with mana?But why did Resillian speak as though telling me to understand the essence of Sword Ki?As I was thinking about it, a hypothesis suddenly popped up in my head.-That must've been a good experience. Thanks to that, you would've been able to wield the law that can't be seen.I remembered what he said about being able to wield the law that can't be seen.It was a hypothesis that the sword I was using wasn't really an ordinary strengthening of the sword\u2026But forming a law that creates a kind of absolute physical power.So, if the law of the invisible world is called mana, how is Sword Flame formed?I forcibly let the mana perceive that the sword is just like my body and accomplished the realm of Body and Sword as One.The conclusion was immediately drawn.'It was the will.'According to the will of the owner, the mana changes its form from moment to moment.Not just pouring the willpower into the realm of Body and Sword as One, which is strong enough to form a Sword Ki, but pouring it into other areas.However, if I put all my willpower into other areas, the Body and Sword as One won't be maintained.'That's why I felt like the Sword Flame didn't have a stronger physical power than Sword Ki.'It didn't increase its physical power, but focused on creating the power that destroys the Sword Ki with willpower.At that moment, I realized why Resillian said martial arts was the only path to God.When you apply willpower to mana, it affects the laws of the real world by twisting them.What else can I call it other than becoming a God when you reach the end of it?Fwwaaaaap!\u300c \u2026'Path of the warrior' achievement unlocked. \u300d\u300c \u2026Power 'Sword Ki Master' grows into Power 'Realm of Sword Flame'.\u300dIt was only for a moment that the ecstasy of becoming like a god enveloped my body.The sense that was hazy at the moment when the sword was wrapped in flames through enlightenment was awakened in an instant.And I swung my sword as I saw Resillian rushing in with his imperfect Sword Flame.And\u2014Kabzzzt!At that moment, Resillian's imperfect sword Flame was eaten by me, and even the blade was destroyed.Slaaaash!Soon, Resillian, in the path of the sword I wielded, was hit by the sword and was greatly pushed back.I opened my mouth without fully understanding what was going on, but\u2026After a while, I was able to fully grasp my own realm.Realm of the Sword Flame.I had stepped into the supreme realm I longed for so much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thank you, adventurer\u2026\u201dAt the words Resillian had uttered, I shook my head with a face as though absurd.\u201cThe help you gave me would be greater. If I hadn't understood the principle of how the Sword Flame works, I wouldn't have been able to use it properly.\u201dIt was true.I couldn't imagine that Sword Ki wasn't just a skill that came out as a result of the Body and Sword as One.Body and Sword as One was simply a matter of how far one could handle their mana to the limit with willpower.By recognizing the sword as a body, allowing mana to permeate the sword, and then transferring the willpower along with the mana to form a blade that cuts through everything.That was the principle of the Sword Ki.And the decisive move called Sword Flame is the technique of Sword Ki developed by interpreting the principle of Sword Ki at a higher level.I could see why Namgung Hyuk told me that skills are just an imitation of martial arts.To think that you could affect the laws of reality if you reached a certain level\u2026An overpowered skill like this couldn't properly be implemented even with skills, and its value was quite considerable.However, in the process of realizing the Sword Flame, I had no choice but to have one doubt.Sword Ki is one's will that greatly influences mana and twists reality.And Sword Flame is to maintain Sword Ki with willpower at a higher level and to instill in the mana the nature of destroying Sword Ki.\u201c\u2026Why didn't you use a proper Sword Flame until the end?\u201dBut it wasn't clear why Resillian had used an incomplete Sword Flame.He was the one who taught me how to activate Sword Flame, as well as the real principle of Sword Flame.Resillian was enlightened enough, and he probably had the same level of willpower to wield Sword Flame as I did.However, he couldn't reach the level of true Sword Flame in the end.The fire fluttering from the blade was weak and wobbly, as if it could be extinguished at any moment.As though he couldn't properly transfer the will to the mana\u2026\u201cDon't tell me\u2026\u201d\u201cSeems like you've noticed. I can't move my mana with willpower properly.\u201d\u201cWhat do you\u2014\u201d\u201cI couldn't control my mana since birth.\u201d\u201cI wanted to walk the path of the sword and become an imperial knight\u2026 but I couldn't. Hahah\u2026 I may have had the talent for swords, but I didn't have the talent for mana.\u201dResillian continued speaking as if it was just his memory of a time.\u201cI wanted to prove myself.\u201dI stood still and listened attentively to the voice that I would've previously ignored and decapitated right away.\u201cI wanted to strike a heavy blow to those who laughed at me for not being able to control my mana.\u201d\u201cSo I mourned and prayed loudly. That I'd become their faithful sword if anybody gives me the ability to handle mana.\u201d\u201c\u2026And the God of Proof gave you the strength, huh.\u201d\u201cYes. They allowed me to move my mana through divine power. It was a really tiny amount of power to control, but that was enough.\u201d\u201cI was able to materialize the aura, and on the way to the next level, I manifested the flame of the sword.\u201d\u201cBut you couldn't use the Sword Flame properly because your ability to control the mana wasn't enough, I see.\u201dAt those words, I slowly blinked my eyes and opened my mouth.\u201c\u2026You were the greatest warrior I've ever seen.\u201dI meant it.Even among the challengers of the Murim dimension, there was no one who walked the path of true martial arts like him.Not just the skills, but even in terms of the character, he was a real martial artist.\u201cI'm glad to hear that. Adventurer, you were great too.\u201dResillian smiled and forced himself to say it in a squeezed voice.\u201cYou've proven your martial arts and put your own belief right.\u201dAt that, I wanted to tell him that he told me everything, but.Resillian raised his hand to prevent me from opening my mouth.\u201cWhen you win against someone and prove your martial arts, don't carry any regrets about it.\u201dGradually, the energy disappears as though the soul is leaking away from Resillian's voice.\u201cThe path of martial arts is to shoulder the karma of the vanished warriors.\u201dHis voice became timid, and soon after, Resillian slowly closed his eyes.\u201cWin, Win again, Keep winning\u2026 and prove your path without regret\u2026\u201dAfter he mumbled those words as though he was dreaming, Resillian showed no signs of moving.At the same time, black energy slowly rose from Resillian's body, and that's when I realized it.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the priest 'Resillian'. \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 14% \u300dHigh priest Resillian was no longer alive.\u300c Innate ability 'Necromancy's' proficiency reached 100%. \u300d\u300c Innate ability 'Necromancy' ranked up. \u300d[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Resillian gave me enlightenment when I was shaken, and even became a support for my mental state.Hesitation on the path to prove one's own martial arts is nothing but a luxury. I shouldn't tell what's right from wrong.And it was inevitably sad that a good man who gave me such realization died.Even if this world was materialized by the Tower of Trials and had no effect on the real word, that fact didn't change.It's because it was Resillian who gave me enlightenment and taught me the path of martial arts.So it was natural to feel sad, and it was natural for guilt to seep into my heart.However\u2026I didn't tremble more or have any confusion.I just calmly accepted his death and soon laid his body, which was leaning against the wall, on the floor.Resillian was dead with a light smile, as if he was satisfied.I looked at his corpse, and after a moment of silence, I brought out the words I couldn't speak.\u201cLike what you told me\u2026 I'll win, win, win again. And prove my martial arts.\u201dCurrently, I had received so much from Resillian that it was difficult to put a price on it.As well as the beliefs of a person walking the path of martial arts, I came to understand the true principle of the skill called Sword Ki.Therefore, if I don't do this at least, I wouldn't feel comfortable.\u300c Administrator 'God-slaying Swordsman' gives a faint smile at your actions.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'The Hero of the Collapsed World' stays silent while watching your actions. \u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' reminiscences the past in your actions.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' feels the qualities of a lord in your actions..\u300dI left the room made of broken mirrors, silently receiving the stares of the administrators.On the way to the fourth hurdle, I could see the broken mirror gradually changing from its broken form to its normal form.The mirror that continued, as though it was gradually becoming a normal mirror, felt like myself changing form as I pass through this hurdle.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite.

When the skill is activated, it said that it becomes easier to gain enlightenment, and the mental protection ability increases significantly.'I guess I'll be using it often since it also has a series of abilities in regards to growth assistance.\u201dWith that, I felt satisfied and soon turned off the status window.Now that I had somewhat checked the things I had acquired, it was time to move.Creak\u2014I slowly opened the door leading to the fourth hurdle, and soon I was able to see the room made of mirrors.Although there were still cracks in the mirror, it was better than the room made out of broken glass in which Resillian was standing.\u201cUh\u2026 Seems like Resillian died. This is a bit out of my expectations.\u201dThe high priest in charge of the fourth hurdle was a little boy.\u201cAre you really an ordinary adventurer who's challenging the hurdles\u2026?\u201dThe boy, who seemed like he had just turned 10 years old, asked that question as though he was dumbfounded.I didn't answer that question right away but first looked at the boy who was the guardian of the fourth hurdle.The boy held a small blade made out of a mirror in his hands and was dressed in a loose-fitting priest robe.Seeing that the vibe he gives off is different, he really did feel like a real priest of God.I stared at the boy silently, then spoke with a tired voice.\u201cI don't really want to have a conversation. Please start the fourth hurdle.\u201dAt that, the boy looked at me, and then said with a cold smile.\u201cSo that's what happened\u2026 You, do you know that? You're out of your mind right now.\u201dTo the boy's tone as though he had become a psychiatrist, I answered flatly.\u201cI know.\u201dBut despite my answer, the boy continued to speak like he was giving me advice.\u201cI don't know what that guy Resillian, who's crazy for martial arts, told you, but you're slowly being consumed by the madness of martial arts.\u201dMaybe he can see through my current state?'To be consumed by the madness of martial arts\u2026'Perhaps the boy's words are the most appropriate expression for my current state.It was amazing, but that doesn't mean I paid close attention to what he said.\u201cSo?\u201d\u201cThe madness of martial arts isn't something that ordinary people can handle. Give up the trial, go outside and focus on resting your mind and body for a while.\u201d\u201cThen what would change?\u201d\u201cAt least you won't be killed in vain by me here. Stop thinking that you can defeat me by only using martial arts.\u201dIn short, if I believed only in the martial arts I had and attacked him, he'd be killing me.After understanding the hidden meaning right away, I immediately shook my head and opened my mouth.\u201cIt doesn't matter, so it'd be better for you to start the trial of the fourth hurdle.\u201d\u201c\u2026It's been a while since I saw someone purely crazy about martial arts like Resillian.\u201d\u201cI'm Kairan, a preliminary apostle who serves the God of Proof.\u201dPreliminary apostle.When I narrowed my eyes at the name of his position, that seemed strong just by hearing it.\u201cStarting now, according to the law of proof, you'll have to prove your flesh to me.\u201dKairan soon announced the beginning of the fourth hurdle and his eyes lit up.And\u2014\u201cCome forth, adventurer who has surrendered himself to madness. Your body will end all the proving here.\u201dAfter finishing his sentence, small wings sprang up from Kairan's back that somehow felt divine.They were wings that seemed impossible to fly with, but the energy you could feel from them was enormous.I could feel the flow of a slightly different energy from mana, but that was probably divine power.'He's amplifying the energy through the wings.'Just like I used the mana circuit to strengthen my body, he was doing something similar.It seems as though he's strengthening himself through the energy transmitted from his wings.Having such a powerful ability, it seemed right for him to call himself a preliminary apostle.However\u2014\u300c Activating the power 'Realm of Sword Flame.' \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Wind's Blessing.' \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Instant Acceleration.' \u300dI wasn't a real warrior who came here only with pure martial arts.\u300c You've encountered a strong opponent for you to handle. \u300d\u300c Activating the skill 'Iron Will.' \u300dNow, it's time to finish this damned proof of the body.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Boundless NecromancerThe Boundless Necromancer Chapter 99\nNewPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99: Journey's End (1)The first impression I felt during the clash with Kairan, a preliminary apostle who was serving the God of Proof, was simple.It was that he uses his power better for dog fights than I expected.Shiiiiiing\u2014!From the fragments of the broken mirror held in Kairan's hands, a pure white ray of light rampaged wildly.During that process, the light rays bounced off the mirrors in the room, and then rushed toward me.The beam of light was shot at me from a blind spot, but nevertheless, I immediately twisted my body to dodge it.\u300c Activating the skill 'Fire Dragon's Eyes.' \u300dKairan took advantage of the room's features that were made out of mirrors to attack from a blindspot.To that, I activated Fire Dragon's Eyes, avoiding and deflecting all rays, blocking Kairan's attack.And soon, I jumped off as though smashing the ground and swung my sword at Kairan's neck at once.However\u2014Next, as the little white wings on Kairan's back moved, a gust of wind blew around him.A fierce gust of wind slowed my movement, telling me it wouldn't allow me to draw near him.And Kairan used that moment to stop emitting rays from the blade and immediately use another skill.I was well aware of the Sword Ki swinging like flames on a broken mirror blade.It was the Sword Flame.Claaaang!Both of our swords clashed, and we were pushed back, but Kiaran immediately moved the blades of the broken mirrors in both his hands.Unlike me, using a single sword, Kairan attacked many times with two blades held in both hands.\u300cActivating the skill 'Chaotic Sword-fighting Play(C+).' \u300d\u300cSword attack speed increases by 12%.\u300d\u300cNumber of stacks \u2013 6/10\u300dOf course, I had some abilities that could increase my attack speed, but\u2026Essentially, Kairan had two swords in his hand, and I only had one.Because of that, I was pushed back while receiving Kairan's fierce attacks as though parrying them.Soon after, Kairan fluttered his wings again and created a gust of wind, and another ray of light was emitted from the two broken mirrors.It was then that I realized why Kairan said that pure martial arts could never defeat him.A sure-win strategy.The power that Kairan owned had no other way to describe it.'It's a very consistent pattern, yet a fucked up one that I can't really come up with a countermeasure.'He bounces the ray to a blindspot, then attacks unexpectedly, and when the enemy blocks it and approaches, he creates a gust of wind with the small wings on his back and pushes the enemy away.Even after pushing through that extreme offense, he overwhelms the opponent with high-level swordsmanship and creates a gust of wind when near.Then, if he succeeds in pushing the opponent away with a gust of wind, he starts attacking again from the beginning.It's at a level where it can be called a sure-win combo that can never be breached.In fact, Kairan still had a confident smile on his face, as though he was aware of that.He was probably hoping for me to become tired and move slowly or end up with reckless actions.If I just keep on blocking it, I'll die of exhaustion, and even if I attempt to do new things, I'll die if it's not certain.Priest Johann, who I encountered first, was already an absurd trial for the hard difficulty but\u2026Now, I wanted to ask if he was really an opponent that can appear even if this is a hard difficulty.\u300c Administrator 'Dark Demon' is bewildered by the level of the preliminary apostle in battle.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Priest of Confession' can't help but be astonished and asks if he's really a preliminary apostle.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Ruler of the Sky' is starting to question the difficulty of this trial on the 11th floor.\u300dQuite a number of administrators were bewildered, as though they knew that the enemy I was dealing against was strong.The situation was quite serious, seeing that even those who had never sent a proper message gave a reaction.\u300c Administrator 'Priest of the Seven Gods' says, he has quite a lot of divine power for a preliminary apostle.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'The Hero of the Collapsed World' enjoys watching this dog fight while chewing on snacks.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Seeker of Divinity' says that the skill of the preliminary apostle is quite suitable to be an apostle.\u300dHowever, the administrators who used to constantly send messages didn't show much of a response.\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is annoyed by the needlessly time-consuming preliminary apostle.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' shines her eyes while looking forward to your actions.\u300dEven the administrators who contracted with me were no different.I felt a little disappointed at that, but soon I erased those feelings and looked at Kairan.He was a high-level swordsman who even used Sword Flame, and at the same time, the strength of his powers was formidable.However, I confirmed that the wings on his back had no other ability than to create and release a gust of wind by amplifying the divine power.In addition, the blade of the broken mirror in Kairan's hands had no other function other than emitting rays.'These should be the only powers that Kairan can use.'When I saw the administrators' reaction, there were a lot of people who said this was a lot of power.And that means even if he had more powers, it would be just one or two more.I should be able to respond properly by analyzing the pattern a little more if it's just that.Therefore\u2014\u300c Activating the skill 'Counter Shield.' \u300dIt was time to put an end to this fight.Kaboom\u2026!!With the Counter Shield summoned above the palm of my hand, I blocked the ray shot from the side.At that, Kairan, flustered quickly fired a larger amount of rays, with both rays, but\u2014The value of this Counter Shield wasn't limited to just blocking attacks.\u300cCharging complete.\u300d\u300cThe skill 'Counter Shield' is in a state where you can reflect the accumulated damage.\u300dAfter using quite a bit of mana in my body to block all of Kairan's rays, my eyes lit up.And\u2014\u300cThe skill 'Counter Shield' releases the accumulated damage at once. \u300dSoon, a single ray of light shot from the shield penetrated Kairan like lightning.[Translator \u2013 Ramen ][Proofreader \u2013\u00a0DVN-L ]Pshhh\u2026!Surprisingly, the wall of the room made of broken mirrors couldn't bounce off the ray I had shot.The wall of broken mirrors melted in the rays of light, and the glass shards melted by the heat.I didn't know if it was because it bounced only the power that Kairan used, or because the ray I shot was powerful, but now one thing was certain.Come and read on our website wuxia worldsite. Thanks\u201cKeheugh\u2026 Wh-What the hell is this\u2026.\u201dKairan was incapacitated.\u201cN-No way\u2026 Th-There's no trace that you've learned any magic, but how\u2026\u201dThere was a fairly large hole around his small body's heart.I wondered how he could speak so normally when his heart must've blown away.But apart from that question, I answered dying Kairan's question straightly.\u201cThat's because everyone at least has a card up on their sleeve.\u201dOf course, Kairan didn't accept what I said and moved his lips.\u201cWhy does a man crazy about swords know how to handle such bullshit magic like this\u2026\u201d\u201cIt's like how you've reached the state of Sword Flame and yet know how to fire a ray of light.\u201dKairan's eyes widened at that.\u201cD-Don't tell me, you also have the power of god\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, It's nothing like that.\u201dI really didn't have the power to fire rays randomly like Kairan.If I did, then I would've killed Kairan by now without analyzing the pattern.However, perhaps it didn't sound good enough for Kairan. He soon squinted his eyes and said as if he was tired of me.\u201cAsshole.\u201dWhen I looked at him in stunned silence at his words, Kairan soon spoke condescendingly.\u201cAccording to the law of proof, you've completed the proof of the body\u2026\u201dAs if conducting a completion ceremony of some sort, Kairan continued his words firmly, even if he was dying.\u201cYou didn't run away from the fight nor lose. I approve of your proof.\u201dKairan spoke up to that point and then changed his attitude and looked at me, and gestured with his head.\u201cSo, get, the fuck off\u2026 First of all, what kind of proof does a monster like you need to prove anyway.\u201dBefore I could even reply something to those words, Kairan's breathing stopped.And at the same time, dark smoke rose from Kairan's body and approached me.\u300c You have absorbed the soul of the priest 'Kairan'. \u300d\u300c Proficiency increased by 13% \u300dIt was then\u2014\u300cThe judgment of power extraction begins by absorbing a soul stronger than the user.\u300dThe new Necromancy ability that I had forgotten was activated, and the judgment of power extraction began.\u300cJudgment complete.\u300dI didn't know what the basis for the judgment was, but the judgment was successful.\u300c It has been confirmed that a power exists in the soul of priest 'Kairan'.\u300d\u300c Extracting power from the soul.\u300dAnd\u2026\u300c The power 'Divine Power (C+)' is being engraved on the soul of user Han Sungyeun.\u300dAt the same time, I felt a new aura in my heart, and I frowned.\u201cDivine power?\u201dFor some reason, it left a bad taste because an unexpected aura entered me.Should I say that it felt like I accidentally swallowed a candy while holding it in my mouth?I didn't know how to use the aura that suddenly settled in my heart, and even when I tried to move, I couldn't move it.I stood there for a moment and tried to activate the divine power, but I soon gave up on the activation.It could be that I didn't have talent or such, but essentially, it felt like there was a separate way to use this aura.\u201cIt's completely different from utilizing mana.\u201dOriginally, I thought of mana as something driven by the strong will of the user.In fact, even before entering the tower in the past, I moved my mana that way.And at that time, of course, I didn't know if I was handling it properly because I had such a small amount of mana that I doubted whether it really existed.I could confirm it by using it in a state where my current mana had grown significantly.Mana was the energy that responded sensitively to the user's will.That's why it's more difficult to handle, and it's tricky to deal with because you have to clear your will out, but it can be dealt with.However, no matter how much I tried to use the divine power, it was immovable, as if it wouldn't move unless the proper procedure was followed.While on it, the administrators noticed that I got divine power and sent a message.\u300c Administrator 'Priest of the Seven Gods' is bewildered by the divine power felt from your body.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Seeker of Divinity' is intrigued by the divine power that was generated even though you're not serving a god.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Priest of Confession' is terrified after seeing the divine power suddenly generated in your heart.\u300dBut everyone's reaction was a bit strange.I frowned at their reactions such as \u201cbewildered\u201d or \u201cterrified.\u201dPerhaps they didn't know that I extracted divine power using my innate ability?'Does that mean that even the administrators don't have the ability to detect that far\u2026?'But other than that, administrators were freaking out about other facts too.\u300c Administrator 'White Crane Sword Saint' wonders why divine power has entered your middle dantian.\u300d\u300c Administrator 'Iron-blooded Monarch' is perplexed as she realizes that there's no trace of god in the divine power that dwells in your heart.\u300dThey were all confused by the fact that I generated divine power even though I don't believe in a god.Is it so strange that I don't believe in god, yet I have divine powers?I thought about it for a while, but it was impossible to properly discern about this with my current knowledge.'I guess I can't help it.'In conclusion, there was nothing I could do, so I moved on.\u300c Permanently increasing your stats using the soul of Priest 'Kairan'. \u300d\u300c Strength increased by 4. \u300d\u300c Agility increased by 3. \u300d\u300c Stamina increased by 3. \u300d\u300c Mana increased by 4. \u300d\u300c Tenacity increased by 5. \u300dAt the same time, I also absorbed the soul of Kairan right away so it wouldn't be consumed by the passive shield.Then, after leaving the room of the broken mirror, I entered the hallway towards the fifth gate.As I walked down the hallway, the cracks in the mirror gradually disappeared, making the mirror completely intact.I wondered if there was any connection with the fact that the cracks on the mirror disappeared just as the proof of the body ended.Of course, as soon as I reached the end of the hallway, I erased that thought and soon opened the door.And\u2026\u201cYou passed.\u201dThe fifth hurdle announced my pass as soon as I arrived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
