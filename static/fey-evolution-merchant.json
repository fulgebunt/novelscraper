When the originally hot and stuffy summer was complemented with the moisture, it made it rather hard for anyone to breathe in this environment.4In this humid heat, an outgoing but frail-looking youth was holding an old-fashioned AI mobile phone. He was fiddling with it for a long time before the phone finally let out its distinctive startup sound.Lin Yuan sighed in relief when he found out that his mobile phone wasn\u2019t faulty. He wouldn\u2019t be able to afford a new one.After switching it on, Lin Yuan logged into the fey website that he frequented. He discovered that his account actually had 99+ notifications when he had merely replied to one question.7When he had been unable to sleep that night, Lin Yuan had stumbled upon a forum post where someone asked for a solution after getting bitten by a Ghost Shadow Bristled Spider. He had answered it in a casual manner.\u201cDo not panic when bitten by the Ghost Shadow Bristled Spider. Drink hot water with Woad Root, then clean the wound. To prevent your corpse from smelling bad, find a shady and ventilated place under a tree, and lie down. If your finances are enough, it is best to lay down a bamboo mat under your body.\u201d15While looking through all sorts of fancy replies, Lin Yuan heard a delicate sound. Suddenly, an ash-black cat pounced on his legs, which was followed by the sounds of flapping wings.A sparrow-like bird that was entirely cyan landed on Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulders and let out two chirps.He quickly put down his mobile phone and asked the ash-black cat that was clinging to his legs, \u201cGenius, what is the temperature of the store now?\u201d6The cat leaped off from Lin Yuan\u2019s legs before replying with a coquettish and sweet voice, \u201cThe room temperature is 34\u00b0C. Yuan, it is time for you to ventilate it and dissipate the heat.\u201d6In response, Lin Yuan carried the ash-black cat in a practiced motion before running downstairs, with the cyan bird that had been chirping still on his shoulder.3As dawn broke across the sky, Lin Yuan opened up the windows in an efficient manner before he carefully walked in front of the flower racks.1At that moment, the ash-black cat spoke again. \u201cLin Yuan, eat your medicine first!\u201d3Lin Yuan immediately stopped in his tracks and went to pour some water instead. At the same time, the cyan bird brought over the medicine tablet with its beak.Lin Yuan received the tablet from the bird and threw the tablet into his mouth before gulping it down with a cup of water.The cyan bird then started a song involuntarily, but Lin Yuan swiftly covered its beak.\u201cChimey, if you sing now, Auntie Zhang from next door will come over again!\u201d2The talking cat, which was previously on Lin Yuan\u2019s legs, and the bird on his shoulder, which could sing, seemed mystical. However, a century after the Spirit Qi Awakening, the ash-black cat and cyan bird were now common existences. Almost everyone had one of them.The cat was called \u201cGenius\u201d, and it was a Hundred Questions Beast. It was a walking encyclopedia and could even fill in the role of a simple lifestyle butler. It was considered a housekeeping beast. However, it was different from other Hundred Questions Beasts on the market, as this ash-black cat was much skinnier and smaller. It truly looked like it was undernourished.3This cat may have been birthed by a mother Hundred Questions Beast, but because its fur didn\u2019t have an even distribution of black, it looked as though it was dirty, and consequently, its owner couldn\u2019t sell it for a long time.2The boss that was selling spirit pets had simply given a 50% discount on the price and let Lin Yuan have it.As for the singing bird, it was a Sound Bird. It was very rare to see Sound Birds getting sold on the market due to the fact that most of the Sound Birds had already evolved into Songstress Birds. A Songstress Bird was just like a living music player, and clever Songstress Birds could learn over 100 songs.7As for this cyan and sparrow-like Sound Bird on Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder, it was a Sound Bird that had failed to evolve into a Songstress Bird.When the boss had seen Lin Yuan hesitating to buy the Hundred Questions Beast, he had added this Sound Bird as a gift to Lin Yuan.After receiving Lin Yuan\u2019s training for over two years, the Sound Bird was able to sing one song now.Chimey was the name of this little Sound Bird. When it had first arrived in this home, it had always been disheartened and drooping its head. All living things had a spirit and could naturally feel everything in their vicinity. Therefore, Lin Yuan would always praise Chimey to slowly build its confidence. As a result, Chimey had been especially lively after learning one song.6An undernourished and abandoned Hundred Questions Beast, a Sound Bird that had been treated like trash after failing to evolve, and a frail youth. No matter what, the trio looked like a rather \u201cweak\u201d combination. However, they were managing the fey store left behind by his parents in an orderly manner.4After consuming the medicine, Lin Yuan walked to the flower racks and carefully took down the black cloth that covered them.Five succulent lotus flower-like plants were growing in the pots. They had an emerald green color and a faint fragrance that was almost undetectable.When Lin Yuan took a closer look at these five stalks of Jasmine Lilies, he couldn\u2019t help but sigh after seeing one of the stalks. One of the Jasmine Lilies\u2019 leaves had turned soft.When is this scorching weather going to end?The Jasmine Lilies were a class of common healing-type fey plants.A century after the Spirit Qi Awakening, all living things in the world were influenced by the Spirit Qi and had different evolution variations.The Jasmine Lily had been a type of succulent plant before the Spirit Qi Awakening, and it was one of those plants that had evolved.If its owner accidentally cut their finger when chopping ingredients, they simply had to put a Jasmine Lily at the bedside, and by the next day, the cut on the finger would be completely healed.2Of course, there were also spirit qi professionals that chose the Jasmine Lily as a contract fey. However, the Jasmine Lily was a fey of the lowest grade, and it was extremely difficult to evolve.3These five pots of Jasmine Lilies in Lin Yuan\u2019s store were all normal-grade. If they could pass elite-grade and reach the doorsteps of bronze-grade, then the Jasmine Lilies would be comparable with other excellent healing-type fey plants.All living things had their status determined by fate; low-grade feys were neglected because it was truly hard to evolve them. However, it would have been different if a low-grade fey was guaranteed to evolve into a high-grade fey. In fact, Lin Yuan heard rumors that low-grade feys had certain aspects that would enable them to suppress high-grade feys.The rise of a low-grade fey was just like an insignificant person climbing to the clouds step by step from the earth. They were unlike high-grade feys that were born at the pinnacle.High-grade feys could also evolve, and it was relatively easier as compared to low-grade feys.That\u2019s why it was rare for people to nurture low-grade feys. The resources required to nurture a low-grade fey were enough to nurture a few high-grade feys. A good example would be why almost every individual possessed a Hundred Questions Beast and Songstress Bird.In this century, after the Spirit Qi Awakening, there had never been a case of a Hundred Questions Beast or a Songstress Bird evolving.10Lin Yuan carefully tended to the five pots of Jasmine Lilies by burying nutritional minerals into their soil. It might not be much of a labor, but Lin Yuan was already panting slightly.Lin Yuan\u2019s store might be called a store, but it only contained two types of fey plants: five pots of Jasmine Lilies and over a dozen pots of Usnea. These Usneas couldn\u2019t even be considered\u00a0Normal1\u00a0feys. They were only considered a variant of the original Usneas before the Spirit Qi Awakening.Apart from the mild toxins, its vines now grew faster, and these vines also had increased nutrition within them. This was also why the Usnea was the best fodder for low-grade herbivorous or omnivorous fey pets.Each day, these pots of Usneas would give around 100 one-meter-long vines for Lin Yuan.\u201cTo maintain my daily life, I still have to rely on these Usneas. If I can sell one pot of these Jasmine Lilies, it will be considered a pleasant surprise.\u201dHowever, even as Lin Yuan looked at the Usneas like an elderly mother, he didn\u2019t have any intention to tend to them. He basically put in all his efforts on the five pots of Jasmine Lilies.2After Lin Yuan cleaned up the dust, this little fey store started its operations as usual after the morning rain.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This was the reason why he looked frail.The feeling of fatigue when he was opening the store every day was something that Lin Yuan was already used to. However, he could feel a spell of dizziness in the depths of his head, and it was seemingly getting more intensive.\u201cMeow, Yuan, go to the chair and sit for a moment.\u201d1The ash-black cat immediately started to walk on Lin Yuan\u2019s pants and clothes before climbing up to his neck. The cat then trembled as it stood up and used its paws\u2019 soft pad to give Lin Yuan\u2019s head a gentle massage.9The Sound Bird was also flying around anxiously as though it was asking why Lin Yuan looked weaker than normal.Lin Yuan then forcefully invigorated himself before hugging the Hundred Questions Beast, Genius, in his arms. His fair fingers had very obvious and distinct bone lines as they stroked across the Hundred Questions Beast\u2019s fur.\u201cGenius, Chimey, you don\u2019t have to worry about me. I probably didn\u2019t sleep well yesterday.\u201d While Lin Yuan was speaking, he started to ponder whether he had really caught a cold again.4His finances to maintain his family\u2019s store were very tight, and it was barely enough to support his younger sister\u2019s school fees. During normal times, he would be frugal on his own meals to save up money.16Poor people were most fearful of falling ill.4After a century since the Spirit Qi Awakening, all of the previously terminal illnesses were now curable with ease. As long as one could find a spirit qi professional, who had contracted a high-grade healing-type fey, treatment could be completed in a single session.4However, the fees for hiring spirit qi professionals with high-grade feys would be more than three months of operation fees for his store.1Lin Yuan might have said so, but Genius and Chimey\u2019s anxiety didn\u2019t reduce at all. It was as though they were afraid of losing their most precious treasure.To Genius and Chimey, they were two inferior housekeeping pets that had been neglected and rejected, and Lin Yuan was their entire world.3When it was at exactly 7 a.m., a forthright and shrewish voice echoed punctually at the entrance.\u201cLittle Yuan, I have told you so many times not to open your store so early. You just have to open it after 8 a.m. so you can have more rest too.\u201dThe one speaking was a middle-aged lady who had placed a wooden square box on Lin Yuan\u2019s reception counter. She then looked at Lin Yuan with a gentle glance before saying, \u201cSame old thing. Give me ten Usnea vines.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan heard this rather passionate and shrewish voice, his face immediately put on a warm smile. Lin Yuan\u2019s face looked extremely amiable from afar when he had this warm smile, just like the summer breeze.\u201cAuntie Zhang, I have told you so many times that you shouldn\u2019t bring me breakfast when you come over to buy something!\u201d While speaking, Lin Yuan had already gone to harvest the Usnea vines in a quick and efficient manner.A pot of Usnea would grow around 13 or 14 vines, which were around 1.5-meter long, per day.One portion of the Usnea vine was exactly one meter long. Lin Yuan\u2019s scissors snipped off ten vines, which were all exactly 1.5 meters in length. He then used a piece of cloth to tightly wrap all ten of the 1.5-meter vines together.3Lin Yuan packed the well-grown and fresh Usnea vines nicely.As Auntie Zhang was watching how Lin Yuan crouched down and proficiently packed the Usnea vines, her eyes flashed with benevolence while feeling heartbroken.As an old neighbor, Auntie Zhang had been watching as Lin Yuan had no choice but to become independent at the age of 12 to support this store in order to provide for himself and his younger sister. He could barely support his younger sister to study, and Auntie Zhang could no longer remember if this was the sixth or the seventh year.4When Lin Yuan brought the Usnea vines to the reception counter, he just happened to see Auntie Zhang looking at him.\u201cAuntie Zhang, if I were to open my store at 8 a.m., you wouldn\u2019t be able to buy such fresh Usnea vines, right?\u201d he asked.Auntie Zhang quickly withdrew her emotional eyes and laughed while saying, \u201cThat is true. Why don\u2019t you learn from how the other stores are doing? These are just Usneas, and you are still putting energy ores in them. How much can you earn with each Usnea vine?\u201d5Lin Yuan smiled and shook his head without saying anything as he listened to Auntie Zhang\u2019s suggestion. At that moment, Lin Yuan was doing his best to support his body as the spell of dizziness plaguing his mind was so intense that he felt he might collapse at any moment.Auntie Zhang understood that this youth had his own principles. Be it the opening of the store at exactly 7 a.m. each day or how he stubbornly insisted on putting energy ores in the Usneas\u2019 soil.While feeling heartbroken, Auntie Zhang still felt a vague admiration for this child that she had been watching grow up. It felt just like how a senior watched the junior grow into a responsible person.Auntie Zhang left behind 75 Federation dollars before turning and walking to the entrance. She said before leaving, \u201cLittle Yuan, your Uncle Li specially baked the flat sesame bread and mung bean milk for you. If you want your Uncle Li to be sad, then don\u2019t eat them.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan saw the extra 25 Federation dollars on the table, he took the money and was about to call out to Auntie Zhang. All of a sudden, his dizziness intensified, and his eyes turned blurry before he fainted.When Auntie Zhang walked away, she felt rather pleased. Every time when she wanted to give Little Yuan extra money, he would never accept it. This time, since she had walked away fast enough, Little Yuan would probably accept it.However, just as she was at the store\u2019s entrance, she heard a clatter as though something had fallen onto the ground. Just before the clattering sound echoed, the Sound Bird and the Hundred Questions Beast let out anxious cries.Auntie Zhang quickly turned around and noticed that Lin Yuan had collapsed on the ground with the 25 dollars in his hand. His eyes were silently closed, and his face looked calm, as though he was sleeping.3Auntie Zhang hurried over with worry to help up Lin Yuan.The moment before Lin Yuan closed his eyes and fainted, his ears could vaguely hear the anxious cries of Genius, Chimey, and Auntie Zhang. Immediately after, his consciousness became murky.In this murky state, it felt just like a swamp that would trap a person\u2019s feet, making it hard to move. It was viscous and deathly still.After fainting, Lin Yuan gradually awakened in a strange environment. His mind flashed with the face of his younger sister, Genius, and Chimey.These three individuals were his closest kin and his greatest worries. If he died, he didn\u2019t know how heartbroken his young sister would be, nor whether anyone would take care of Chimey and Genius.It was fortunate that he had already saved up enough to pay for his young sister\u2019s school fees for next year.Lin Yuan\u2019s consciousness started walking around in this chaotic place. It was unknown how long he had been walking. All of a sudden, at the end of the chaotic place, Lin Yuan saw something that he was extremely familiar with.It was a simple and unadorned copper-colored bracelet.This bracelet had been Lin Yuan\u2019s secret for all this time. In fact, this life was actually Lin Yuan\u2019s second life.14His previous life had been high-spirited, and he had been in his prime. Unfortunately, he had died early at the age of 30. Upon opening his eyes, he was a newly born infant one century after the Spirit Qi Awakening. When he had been reborn, this copper bracelet had accompanied him.10Since then, he had been wearing this bracelet on his wrist. However, when he was eight years old, it had accidentally gotten smeared by his own blood and mysteriously vanished.3He would never have expected to discover the copper-colored bracelet in the depths of this place. The copper bracelet was currently flickering with a faint light. It caused the depths of his consciousness to be brimming with a tea-like ripple with jade luster.This bracelet was just like a door that was waiting for Lin Yuan\u2019s consciousness to step across it.4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were all intersected with each other but had this unimaginable swiftness.Lin Yuan felt indescribably relaxed after passing through this simple and unadorned ring of light. In this relaxed state, Lin Yuan was actually able to sense the world\u2019s spirit qi that was surrounding his body.It was a kind of sensation that Lin Yuan hadn\u2019t felt since he had been eight years old when the copper bracelet had been stained with his blood and vanished without a trace.When the copper bracelet had vanished, it hadn\u2019t just robbed his senses toward the world\u2019s spirit qi, but it had also robbed his spiritual energy.6Presently, his spiritual energy might still be as dried up as before, but now, he could at least sense the spirit qi in the world.His body had become so frail because he could no longer sense the world\u2019s spirit qi.After the Spirit Qi Awakening, spirit qi had become this world\u2019s most fundamental energy. The planet\u2019s native animals and plants had all been able to evolve toward two traits due to spirit qi\u2019s influence.One of the traits was to revert to their ancestors\u2019 wild nature, enhancing the physical body\u2019s capabilities. The other trait was to transform spiritually and focus on energy attacks.As for humans, they had also developed spirit qi occupations under the influence of spirit qi. There were all sorts of spirit qi occupations, but they fundamentally used spirit qi to enhance the body.Since Lin Yuan had stopped sensing spirit qi at the age of eight, he had no longer relied on spirit qi to improve his body\u2019s capabilities. He had been relying on nature to grow and food to obtain energy.3Lin Yuan felt involuntarily excited. Although he didn\u2019t know why his body was unable to store spirit qi, he could at least sense its existence now. He might be able to absorb spirit qi at an appalling speed that no one had witnessed before, but the spirit qi that gathered in his body would quickly leak out of his hands.5His body was just like a funnel, and this was why Lin Yuan knew that he was destined to fail as a spirit qi professional. Despite the case that all spirit qi coursing through the body wouldn\u2019t remain, he would still be able to enhance his body\u2019s capabilities through this process. This way, he would no longer have to consume medicine, which was meant to nurture his body.Over the span of a year, he would be able to save up a huge sum of money. His young sister was already coming to the age that she could form a contract with her first fey.1With all the money that he saved up, he would be able to purchase a fey, which would be considered superior among Normal feys, for his young sister. In fact, he might be able to purchase a low-tier Elite fey.\u201cThis body can finally sense spirit qi! However\u2026\u201d Lin Yuan didn\u2019t finish the rest of the sentence.Lin Yuan was always optimistic. However, even though he could sense spirit qi now, Lin Yuan felt it was a pity that his spiritual energy remained weak like before.A century after the Spirit Qi Awakening, the spiritual energy was something that was as important as spirit qi.Spirit qi professionals could form contracts with feys. Feys were sorted into healing-type, offense-type, defense-type, and support-type. Among them, offense-type and support-type feys were the most in numbers.3In order to form a contract with feys, one would require spiritual energy.5A regular person would be able to form contracts with two to three feys in a lifetime, and prodigies might be able to form up to five contracts.7One\u2019s strength would undergo a significant increase with each additional fey. Nevertheless, the resources required to nurture an additional fey would also increase significantly.3In regard to feys, the most difficult aspect was to evolve them. The resources required for each evolution was far beyond what Lin Yuan, an owner of a small spirit store, could afford.4Lin Yuan\u2019s spiritual energy was weak and frail, like a thread of hair. Back when Lin Yuan had formed contracts with domestic feys like the Hundred Questions Beast and the Sound Bird, he had fainted and had been unconscious for three full days.3After waking up, Lin Yuan had had a splitting headache for at least half a month. This had given Lin Yuan a direct cognition of how frail his spiritual energy was.When he had been born, his spiritual energy hadn\u2019t been superior, but it hadn\u2019t been inferior either. His spiritual energy had become frail at the same time when he could no longer sense spirit qi. The reason that his spiritual energy had been weak was probably due to this copper bracelet.This copper bracelet had transmigrated to this world along with him, but it was also the reason he had become weak and useless.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but have a complicated opinion of the copper bracelet.At that moment, Lin Yuan could only feel his feet stepping on the ground\u2019s hard surface. When he looked up, Lin Yuan noticed he was in another spatial zone, which was around 40 square meters. The ground was copper in color within this spatial zone, and there was a five-meter or six-meter pool.Apart from that, there was nothing else.When Lin Yuan walked to the poolside, he noticed that the water was extremely clear, and it could reflect a youth\u2019s face.The pool wasn\u2019t deep, as it was only around half a meter in depth. Lin Yuan crouched down and scooped up a handful of water. He could feel that the water was mild in temperature. When he smelled the water, he realized that it was just regular water as it didn\u2019t contain spirit qi.While pondering, Lin Yuan felt his wrist area becoming heavy. He noticed that his wrist was now wearing that simple and unadorned copper bracelet. At that moment, the copper bracelet emitted a trace of desire to communicate with him.This desire to communicate contained feelings of fondness, timidness, and confusion. It felt just like a child\u2019s wisdom that had just been developed.As soon as Lin Yuan used his consciousness to make contact with the copper bracelet, everything that Lin Yuan didn\u2019t understand ever since the age of eight had all been answered.\u201cIt turns out that this copper bracelet, which transmigrated with me, is actually a fey. When I was eight years old, I stained the copper bracelet with my blood and actually formed a contract with it because of my mistake. I actually formed a contract with a fey at the age of eight by accident!\u201d7Lin Yuan was in disbelief. He used his left hand to touch the copper bracelet that was on his right wrist, and immediately a wave of calmness washed over him, helping him recover from the state of instability. He now had a contracted fey too, and he might be able to earn much more money from now on.3Furthermore, his young sister\u2019s fey wouldn\u2019t need to be of the Normal or Elite grade anymore. If he worked hard, he might be able to give his younger sister a Bronze fey, right?1In fact, to a certain extent, only when a fey reached bronze-grade would it be considered as a true fey.1Previously, Lin Yuan had complicated thoughts toward this copper bracelet. However, after thinking it through, Lin Yuan understood why he only had a trace of spiritual energy, which had been just enough for him to lead a normal life for the past ten years.He also understood why the copper bracelet had been silent and had not communicated with him for ten years.The copper bracelet had been trying to protect the 8-year-old Lin Yuan, who hadn\u2019t had powerful spiritual energy. Thus, it had chosen to hibernate.The hibernation had slowed down the contract\u2019s forming, so it had taken ten years to form the complete contract. Today was also the day when the copper bracelet awakened.5When it sensed Lin Yuan\u2019s emotional reactions, the copper bracelet on his right wrist emitted a gentle feeling. It felt like it was trying to soothe or mentally hint for Lin Yuan to calm down.Upon sensing that Lin Yuan was calming down, the copper bracelet tightened and secured itself firmly on Lin Yuan\u2019s right wrist. It felt as though it was holding Lin Yuan\u2019s hands tightly and saying, \u201cPleased to meet you, Lin Yuan.\u201dLin Yuan revealed a smile, which was like the sunshine during dawn that broke through the darkness. It was just like the rising sun\u2019s silhouette behind the mountain.6The youth then said with a gentle and mild voice, \u201cPleased to meet you, Morbius.\u201d1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter forming a contract with a human, no matter what kind of fey, even a Normal one, would possess an ability. The type of ability was most probably a species\u2019 innate ability.1Take Jasmine Lily as an example. Even if a person were to form a contract with a Normal Jasmine Lily, they would get a healing ability.The comprehended ability was also the most fundamental. For a fey to obtain a powerful ability, it would need to evolve to bronze-grade and awaken its exclusive skill. Subsequently, the exclusive skill could be used to complement the abilities to achieve overwhelmingly powerful changes.This was also why people said that reaching bronze-grade was the true beginning of a fey. Therefore, for any spirit qi professional who had a little background, they would always pick a Bronze fey for their first contract.When a fey reached bronze-grade, they would awaken different bronze-grade skills. That also applied to feys of the same species. This uniqueness allowed spirit qi professionals to pick a fey which had awakened a skill that was more compatible or helpful to themselves.In order to form a contract with a fey, one needed spiritual energy, as it could fuse one\u2019s soul with the fey\u2019s soul. That\u2019s why once someone formed a contract, the difficulty in dissolving it would be as hard as ascending to the heavens.This was also why many experts who had formed contracts with low-grade feys due to insufficient resources didn\u2019t replace them after the former got stronger. Instead, they would use resources to evolve their low-grade feys.2Lin Yuan was observing Morbius as he wanted to check its attribute. Presently, Morbius\u2019 level of spirituality only allowed it to express subtle emotions. In order to have a regular conversation with Morbius, Lin Yuan would have to recover for some time.When checking on Morbius\u2019 attribute, Lin Yuan discovered that it was merely a Normal fey. However, Morbius\u2019 attribute wasn\u2019t like a Normal fey\u2026 Because Morbius didn\u2019t just have an ability, it had an exclusive skill!3Everyone knew that exclusive skills were something that only Bronze feys would possess.\u201cHeavens, my contracted fey, Morbius, seems rather powerful!\u201d Lin Yuan\u2019s irises expanded as he was rather surprised.5Morbius, which had come to this world at the same time as him, had an exclusive skill when it was at normal-grade. If Morbius reached bronze-grade and awakened another exclusive skill, it would possess dual exclusive skills!3However, in legends, only when someone nurtured a fey into a Fantasy Breed would it possess dual exclusive skills.5Fantasy Breeds had always been a legend, and Lin Yuan could not get any access to such privy information right now. Nevertheless, when compared with ordinary feys, Fantasy Breeds were in another league.4Soon, joy replaced Lin Yuan\u2019s amazement. Suddenly, he felt Morbius sending an emotional signal asking him to use its first ability on it.1Lin Yuan immediately used Morbius\u2019 first ability after receiving the request. Once Lin Yuan executed the first ability, he looked at Morbius and realized that all information had been presented in a data format.[Fey Name]: Morbius[Fey-Lifeform Species]: ???7[Fey Grade]: Normal (1/10)[Fey Type]: Spatial/Mystery[Fey Quality]: NormalAbilities:[True Data]: All complicated information that is invisible to the eye is turned into data. Information that is turned into data might contain truth that cannot be distinguished on the surface.12[Calm Mind]: Passive ability. Effects of Calm Mind can be improved according to the fey\u2019s grade. Calm Mind can stabilize the mind and has a certain probability of resisting negative conditions.Exclusive Skill:[Spirit Lock]: Morbius\u2019 spatial zone can be used to nurture feys. The initial grade of the fey that Morbius\u2019 spatial zone can nurture must not be higher than Morbius\u2019 grade. Morbius isn\u2019t able to increase its grade by itself, so its grade will be increased along with the fey\u2019s grade that it nurtures. At the same time, Morbius can obtain the initial ability of the fey that it nurtures. However, Morbius will not obtain abilities when its grade increases. Whenever Morbius increases a grade, it will be able to nurture one more fey. Morbius\u2019 method of growth will remain unchanged.13When Lin Yuan read the information presented by Morbius\u2019 True Data, his smile froze on his face\u2026A short moment after the frozen smile, Lin Yuan trembled as he sent a message to Morbius. After obtaining Morbius\u2019 confirmation, Lin Yuan nearly collapsed.\u201cThis is a goddamn fraud! Morbius is a Normal\u00a0I1\u00a0fey right now! That means that I can only use the Spirit Lock ability to form a contract with a Normal I fey. Moreover, the amount of resources to nurture a fey is already overwhelming, and my current spiritual energy doesn\u2019t allow me to contract with any fey, even if it is a Normal one!\u201d5The fey might be living inside Morbius\u2019 spatial zone, but Lin Yuan should still be the one that formed the contract. Lin Yuan was still traumatized by the horrible incident when he had formed a contract with the domestic beasts, Chimey and Genius.2The terrifying thing was that Morbius\u2019 Spirit Lock spatial zone could only allow one more contracted fey after an increase in grade. Morbius could only increase its grade by nurturing the fey. With so much investment, the return would only be the contracted fey\u2019s initial and fundamental ability.3The ratio of investment and return wasn\u2019t proportionate. In addition, it was challenging to evolve a fey, especially low-grade ones. When did Lin Yuan have the capability to evolve constantly low-grade feys?The Spirit Lock skill would probably deplete a rich person\u2019s wealth in an instant. Therefore, there was no need to mention a person like Lin Yuan, who was almost penniless.2A sense of loss quickly replaced Lin Yuan\u2019s joy in obtaining a contracted fey. However, Lin Yuan\u2019s optimistic attitude adjusted soon.1He was in a much better situation than before. The future might still be filled with difficulties, but his journey in this life had always been filled with thorns. At least, he could see a direction to the future right now, so there wasn\u2019t a need to be at a loss.The trouble-filled past should be forgotten as the future path was bright and dazzling.Just as Lin Yuan was adjusting his mentality, Morbius transferred a rather faint strand of spiritual energy to his mind. The strand-like spiritual energy in his mind suddenly increased by over five times. Unfortunately, it was just slightly thicker than a strand of hair and wasn\u2019t even 1/10 of a regular person.Nonetheless, this spiritual energy amount was enough to form a contract with a Normal I fey plant. It was probably insufficient to form contracts with animals.According to general knowledge, contracting animals would require more spiritual energy than to contract a fey plant.The only exception would be if one could obtain the egg of the animal. When the animal hatched from the egg, it would be the moment its spiritual energy was the most inexperienced. Thus, one might form a contract with it.2After receiving the spiritual energy, Lin Yuan felt Morbius becoming weak. Morbius had forced out some of its spiritual energy and transferred it to Lin Yuan.Everyone said that feys had spirituality, and once they formed a contract with a human, the fey would stay with the human for an entire lifetime.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have a chance to experience it before, but after witnessing Morbius\u2019 actions, Lin Yuan immediately understood the statement\u2019s significance.From now on, they would be interdependent until death!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMorbius fell back into a deep slumber after transferring its spiritual energy.Lin Yuan carefully observed the spatial zone he was in.This spatial zone should be meant for nurturing feys, as mentioned from the exclusive skill, Spirit Lock.Before Lin Yuan could conduct more detailed observations, he could vaguely hear something. A familiar voice was calling him, and it sounded rather anxious.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Little Yuan waking up? Doctor, didn\u2019t you say that his spirit merely received stimulation and is in a fatigued state? Why doesn\u2019t he look any better after half a day?\u201dThe voice belonged to Auntie Zhang, and due to anxiety, she was constantly asking questions.\u201cYuan, Yuan, meow, meow.\u201dIt was the Hundred Questions Beast\u2019s voice. Genius could communicate in human language, but it would unconsciously emit bestial sounds when it was anxious.\u201cChirp, chirp, chirp! Chirp, chirp, chirp!\u201d The Sound Bird, Chimey, was also anxiously chirping.When Lin Yuan had suddenly fainted, Auntie Zhang, Genius, and Chimey had all been shocked.At that moment, Lin Yuan\u2019s consciousness finally returned to his body. When he opened his eyes, he immediately saw Chimey standing on his nose and looking at him nervously.He then saw Auntie Zhang constantly questioning the doctor, which made the doctor\u2019s forehead sweat profusely.Lin Yuan suddenly opened his eyes and unwittingly frightened Chimey, causing it to jump up and chirp twice. It then immediately reacted joyfully and hopped on Lin Yuan\u2019s nose while chirping cheerfully.Genius also scuttled along Lin Yuan\u2019s neck area and carefully rubbed its body against his neck. Perhaps it was frightened witless earlier, as Genius was actually trembling a little.Auntie Zhang heard Chimey and Genius\u2019 responses, and when she turned around, she happened to see Lin Yuan opening his eyes. She couldn\u2019t be bothered with questioning the doctor anymore.When she saw that Lin Yuan wanted to get up, she immediately said, \u201cLittle Yuan, lie back down. I will get the doctor to check on you again. You have been unconscious for close to ten hours. It is already evening now. If you have an illness, you have to treat it as soon as possible. Otherwise, a common illness might also lead to severe illness.\u201dAuntie Zhang\u2019s concern warmed Lin Yuan\u2019s heart. He had received plenty of care from Auntie Zhang for the past few years. However, Lin Yuan knew that his body didn\u2019t have any problem. He had fainted because of Morbius\u2019 awakening and because he had formed a contract with Morbius.4Auntie Zhang was still not at ease, and just as she was about to say something, the doctor walked over and said, \u201cKid, you truly frightened your aunt with your illness. I will use the Clear Pond Carp to heal you.\u201dThe doctor immediately summoned his contracted fey, which was a half-foot-long greenish-black carp.The carp had massive scales on the side of its body, and when the doctor activated the ability, one of the sparkling scales fell off. It floated in front of Lin Yuan while he felt a warm spiritual world that was extremely comfortable.1At that moment, Lin Yuan secretly activated Morbius\u2019 ability, True Data, to check on the Clear Pond Carp\u2019s attribute.[Fey Name]: Clear Pond Carp1[Fey Species]: Carp subspecies/Carp species[Fey Grade]: Elite (4/10)[Fey Type]: Water[Fey Quality]: EliteAbilities:[Tail Lash]: Jumps up and uses the fish\u2019s tail to execute a lash attack.2[Clear Scales]: Gradually recover spiritual trauma. It is able to alleviate abnormal spiritual conditions.5Upon seeing the Clear Pond Carp\u2019s species, Lin Yuan felt that its attribute was Normal, but to his surprise, it was an Elite fey.After reading through the Clear Pond Carp\u2019s information, Lin Yuan felt that this doctor was very fortunate.Clear Pond Carps were very ordinary water-type feys, and when they were at normal-grade, their initial abilities would be physical ones, such as Tail Lash or Fin Flap.2Unexpectedly, when this Clear Pond Carp had reached elite-grade, it had awakened the rare ability, Clear Scales. It allowed the Clear Pond Carp to transform into a\u00a0dragon1\u00a0and obtain an uncommon spirit-healing ability.4Soon, more perspiration appeared on the doctor\u2019s forehead. When the Clear Pond Carp\u2019s scale lost its luster, the doctor stopped the ability, and the fallen scale turned into ashes.\u201cThere is nothing major. You will recover very quickly if you have more rest and consume more nutritional food.\u201d While speaking, the doctor was about to use his sleeve to wipe off his sweat, but Auntie Zhang handed over a tissue.\u201cDoctor, it has been hard on you. Please, clean your sweat with this.\u201dThe doctor received the tissue from Auntie Zhang and said, \u201cI am done with the healing, so I shall leave first. It is rather late. My wife is still waiting for me to have a meal.\u201dThe doctor packed up his things and walked out of the store. When he left, his forehead might still be covered in sweat, but his eyes betrayed his delight. He might be a small-time doctor, but the joy of healing and saving others was a rather satisfying reward.7After the doctor left, Auntie Zhang looked at Lin Yuan with concern and said, \u201cLittle Yuan, if you aren\u2019t feeling well, don\u2019t force yourself. Your body is your capital. If you fall sick, what will Little Ci do?\u201dAuntie Zhang was afraid that Lin Yuan would neglect his body, so she intentionally mentioned his young sister, who was studying far away.\u201cAuntie Zhang, don\u2019t worry, I will bring you the doctor\u2019s fees tomorrow. I am really sorry for troubling you for the entire day.\u201dLin Yuan had a sincere expression as he spoke. Then, he stood up and saw the Usneas growing with vines that were almost three meters in length. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh at the sight.1He then poured a cup of water for Auntie Zhang with gratitude.\u201cLittle Yuan, don\u2019t be so courteous with me. Your Uncle Li and I have watched you growing up after all.\u201dAuntie Zhang received the cup of water, downed it in one mouthful, and burped. She had been so anxious to the point she had forgotten about drinking water all day.After drinking the water, Auntie Zhang noticed that Lin Yuan was insisting on being courteous, so she didn\u2019t say anything else, aware that this youth had his own resolutions.Upon seeing Auntie Zhang\u2019s empty cup, Lin Yuan was about to pour more water, but she shook her hand. \u201cLittle Yuan, give me one pot of Jasmine Lily. I will put it at your Uncle Li\u2019s bedside later.\u201dAt the same time, Auntie Zhang took out 500 Federation dollars and placed them in Lin Yuan\u2019s hands.Lin Yuan looked at the money and said helplessly, \u201cAuntie Zhang, you have been buying a pot of Jasmine Lily every month. Sometimes, you even buy one pot within the same month. You really don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201dBefore Lin Yuan could finish his sentence, Auntie Zhang interrupted him. \u201cCan\u2019t your Auntie Zhang put more pots in her house?\u201dLin Yuan didn\u2019t have a choice but to bring a pot of Jasmine Lily to Auntie Zhang. He picked the one that was in the best condition, but Auntie Zhang had already carried the pot that had softened leaves and would only last for a few days.\u201cI shall take this as it looks rather fated with me,\u201d she said.The scene of Auntie Zhang carrying that Jasmine Lily caused Lin Yuan\u2019s heart to surge with warmth. It was always like this\u2014she would use the same tone and attitude and would carry the same kind of Jasmine Lily.1Suddenly, little \u201cthud, thud, thud\u201d sounds echoed. They came from a rabbit, which was like a middle-sized dog. Its fur was a mix of red and black, its palm-leaf-like ears were massive, almost its body height, and it also looked like a mouse.When Genius and Chimey heard its signature sounds, they quickly rushed to the entrance. Genius lay on the large rabbit\u2019s body, while Chimey landed on the large rabbit\u2019s head.This large rabbit was none other than Auntie Zhang\u2019s contracted fey. It was also Genius\u2019 and Chimey\u2019s only spirit beast friend for the past few years.The large rabbit ran toward Auntie Zhang; one of its ears was carrying a package that was wrapped in blue cloth.Lin Yuan had always been under the impression that it was a Terror Rabbit. However, when he activated True Data to check the rabbit that he was very familiar with, Lin Yuan realized that it wasn\u2019t the case!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yuan was naturally curious and consciously looked at Auntie Zhang\u2019s Terror Rabbit, which he had frequently interacted with because of the new ability.After reading through the information his True Data had compiled, it seemed that this rabbit wasn\u2019t a Terror Rabbit. Its current appearance was merely a powerful fey\u2019s camouflaging ability.2Unexpectedly, True Data also revealed that this powerful fey was in a severely injured state. This powerful fey\u2019s abilities and skills were in a locked condition.It seems like the injuries don\u2019t allow this fey to release any ability\u2026Although the new pieces of information were surprising enough, Lin Yuan was awestruck because of something else he had noticed\u2014two skills were actually locked!Could this be a legendary Fantasy Breed?2Lin Yuan suddenly recalled True Data\u2019s second part\u2014\u201d\u2026Information that is turned into data might contain truth that cannot be distinguished on the surface.\u201dIt seems that the pieces of information turned into data are indeed more reliable than seeing with the eyes\u2026This discovery left Lin Yuan rather shaken as it looked like Auntie Zhang was also a person with a story.2But who didn\u2019t have a story?4Anyway, these things were of little importance as Auntie Zhang would always be Auntie Zhang to Lin Yuan. If he became capable enough in the future, he would definitely heal Auntie Zhang\u2019s Terror Rabbit\u2026 No, the powerful fey.When Auntie Zhang noticed that Lin Yuan\u2019s complexion was no longer pale and his cheeks were even rosier than this morning, she felt at ease. Then, she removed the blue-cloth-wrapped package from her Terror Rabbit\u2019s ear and placed it on Lin Yuan\u2019s reception counter.\u201cLittle Yuan, this is a nutritional meal that your Uncle Li specially prepared for you after finding out that you fainted. Your Uncle Li\u2019s legs aren\u2019t good, and it isn\u2019t convenient for him to deliver it personally. Thus, he sent this troublemaker to deliver it to you.\u201dAfter speaking, Auntie Zhang rubbed the Terror Rabbit\u2019s ear and looked at its warm-filled eyes. Then, she passed the meal box to Lin Yuan, and before he could speak, Aunty Zhang waved her hand without turning back and left with the withered Jasmine Lily.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t say anything and watched quietly as Auntie Zhang left. He clenched his fist tightly as though he was encouraging himself and as though he had set his mind on something.A person must have some goals! Without a burden, how would one be able to progress unyieldingly?The sky gradually turned dark\u2026Presently, Lin Yuan, Chimey, and Genius were the only ones in the store. It might not have visitors, but it wasn\u2019t cheerless and cold. On the contrary, it was very lively and warm.Evidently, Genius and Chimey still had lingering fears. They were chattering around Lin Yuan and afraid that something else might happen to him.Lin Yuan knew that Chimey and Genius were worried sick, so he reached out his hand to rub Genius\u2019 chin. Soon enough, Genius let out a purring sound as it enjoyed the treatment.Chimey\u2019s little talons were holding onto Lin Yuan\u2019s ear while its tiny head plunged into his hair as though it was playing hide-and-seek.Lin Yuan unwrapped the package, and a bamboo meal box appeared. He opened up the meal box, and the fragrance of the food immediately wafted in the air. On the top-most box, there was a full layer of rice. When he removed the top-most box, Lin Yuan discovered that the bottom box was filled with red braised meat, stir-fried long beans, and pan-fried fish.3Lin Yuan had been unconscious for an entire day, and he had yet to eat or drink anything. Naturally, his stomach uncontrollably started to rumble.This wasn\u2019t the first time Lin Yuan had tasted Uncle Li\u2019s cooking. Every other day, Uncle Li would find all sorts of excuses for the Terror Rabbit or Auntie Zhang to deliver food for him.Lin Yuan had visited Uncle Li last year, and his leg injuries were already getting worse. Presently, he was no longer able to walk outside.Lin Yuan pondered over the Terror Rabbit\u2019s existence and speculated that Uncle Li and Auntie Zhang were both formidable individuals. Otherwise, it would be impossible for them to possess a Fantasy Breed, a fey with dual exclusive skills.Lin Yuan was unaware of Auntie Zhang and Uncle Li\u2019s past and could not get involved. He merely hoped that he would be formidable enough to heal the Terror Rabbit and Uncle Li\u2019s legs one day.As Lin Yuan opened the meal box, Genius and Chimey leaned over. Chimey took a whiff of the fragrance and flapped its wings, flying to a small pot of Usnea. Lin Yuan was especially nurturing this small pot of Usnea for Chimey.Chimey was a Sound Bird and was considered an omnivore, but as compared to cooked food, Chimey preferred to eat the Usnea\u2019s leaves.Chimey delightfully pecked on the Usnea leaves, while Genius was looking intently at the food in the meal box. It was sitting there, obediently.Upon noticing how Genius was staring at the red braised meat, Lin Yuan smiled and picked out the largest piece of red braised meat for Genius.\u201cGo ahead and eat, you little greedy cat.\u201dGenius looked at the large piece of red braised meat and couldn\u2019t stop swallowing its saliva. However, it used its small paw to push the meat back to Lin Yuan. It then picked the smallest piece of red braised meat in the meal box before letting out a meow. It was asking for Lin Yuan to eat the large piece of meat, while it would eat the small piece of meat.9The Hundred Questions Beast\u2019s actions made Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes warm up a little. He brought a small bowl before picking a few large pieces of red braised meat and fried fish. He then mixed them with a scoop of rice and placed it in front of the Hundred Questions Beast.2\u201cGenius, Chimey, in the future, we will be eating better.\u201dDuring the past two days, the Hundred Questions Beast and Sound Bird had suffered along with him. Such words were something that Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t able to normally say as he didn\u2019t have the confidence.2However, he now had his own contracted fey, and his body wasn\u2019t as frail as before because he could sense spirit qi. He firmly believed that their lives would definitely improve now.4The world was a difficult place, but plenty of people were able to survive and prosper. Young people should have aspirations and strive for greatness. Lin Yuan had to plan for his future, or else he would remain an ordinary person no matter how many years passed.After eating dinner, Lin Yuan conducted a routine check on the four pots of Jasmine Lilies that were left in his store. All four pots of Jasmine Lilies were growing rather well.1Since he had inspected the Jasmine Lilies\u2019 growth, Lin Yuan turned to speak with Genius, which was standing on his shoulder. \u201cGenius, what is the temperature now?\u201dGenius quickly replied, \u201cLin Yuan, the temperature is 31\u00b0C now. However, it is too humid. It is not advisable to expose the Jasmine Lilies in the night.\u201d2Lin Yuan responded by taking down the fluorescent light and black cloth. He then turned to trim the Usneas.He hadn\u2019t managed to sell any Usneas, so the vines were already over three meters long. Vines that were two days old would have a tough texture, and the majority of the herbivorous feys didn\u2019t like eating tough vines.Lin Yuan insisted on the quality of the feys that he sold, and for vines that were tough like this, he would throw them out and wouldn\u2019t sell them.After trimming the last pot of Usnea, Lin Yuan involuntarily let out a sigh. He remembered that he was still unable to store spirit qi in his body, even though he could sense it. His body was rapidly absorbing spirit qi, but Lin Yuan\u2019s hand was still holding onto the Usnea\u2019s leaves.1He circulated the spirit qi for a moment but stopped absorbing when he felt exhausted.Unfortunately, Lin Yuan noticed that his body still didn\u2019t contain any spirit qi.Genius felt Lin Yuan\u2019s disappointment and started to rub on Lin Yuan\u2019s cheek. It meowed but didn\u2019t say anything and just accompanied quietly by the side.1Lin Yuan carried Genius before he carefully carried Chimey, which had dozed off on the small pot of Usnea. He switched off the lights and went upstairs in the dark. He immediately collapsed on the bed and fell asleep.This night was serene and peaceful. A youth, a Hundred Questions Beast, and a Sound Bird were all sleeping soundly on a small bed.The youth was in a very deep sleep, but the Hundred Questions Beast and the Sound Bird could vaguely sense something. They snuggled closer toward the youth and found comfort before falling into a deep slumber with pleasant dreams.9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Because it was close to the sea, the weather was mostly rainy, and there were only a few rare days in a month when the sun could be seen. However, the sun that slowly rose up in the east would illuminate the entire city and dye half the sky in red at dawn.It was rare for the Xia Region to have such great weather and clear skies. Soon enough, the sky\u2019s color was no longer hazy as there was an entire horizon of blue, just like the sea. It was so blue that it was comforting.1When the rays of light rays passed through the windows and into the room, they happened to shine onto Lin Yuan\u2019s closed eyes. After getting dazzled by the rays of light, Lin Yuan slowly woke up from his dreams.1After waking up, Lin Yuan felt that his body was very relaxed, unlike before, when his body would remain sore and fatigued even after a night\u2019s rest. It seemed like the ability to sense spirit qi and the transference of Morbius\u2019 spiritual energy had strengthened his spiritual energy. It allowed his body condition to be significantly better than yesterday.When he picked up his phone to look at the time, it was already close to 6 a.m.Lin Yuan felt it was rather strange as Chimey and Genius were just like his alarm clocks, especially Genius, which would naturally wake up at 5 a.m. every day. Unexpectedly, Genius was actually still in a deep sleep today.Lin Yuan sat up, and just as he was preparing to wake up Genius and Chimey, he realized that they were surrounded by a pile of shed fur and feathers.A bundle of ash-black and disordered fur was next to Genius, while a bundle of dull green feathers was around Chimey.Lin Yuan got nervous, thinking that Chimey and Genius were sick!Lin Yuan subconsciously used Morbius\u2019 ability, True Data.To Lin Yuan\u2019s surprise, he realized that he could actually see Genius and Chimey\u2019s data! He had used True Data on Genius and Chimey just yesterday before checking on the Clear Pond Carp\u2019s information. However, True Data had not displayed any information on Genius and Chimey.Be it the domestic Hundred Questions Beast, or the Sound Bird, which had failed to evolve into the Songstress Bird, they couldn\u2019t be considered as feys. That was because they hadn\u2019t even reached the standards of a Normal fey.2Presently, True Data\u2019s displayed information indicated that both Genius and Chimey were Normal feys!This had overturned all of the knowledge that Lin Yuan had learned over a dozen years after arriving in this world. The Hundred Questions Beast and Sound Bird were domestic beasts, and everyone had them. Nevertheless, there was never any case of a Hundred Questions Beast and Sound Bird evolving into feys!4In fact, even the Sound Bird\u2019s evolution, the Songstress Bird, wasn\u2019t qualified to be called a Normal fey. But now, both these little fellows had evolved.4Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t understand, but he didn\u2019t immediately wake up Genius and Chimey. Instead, he carefully cleaned up the shed fur and feathers before he went out for morning exercise.1In the past, Lin Yuan\u2019s spiritual energy had been weak, and it already exhausted all of Lin Yuan\u2019s energy just to live normally. Now that his body condition had improved, Lin Yuan decided to train his body as it was all of his capital.After one hour of running and resting in the morning\u20262Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t even able to breathe normally when he returned. After all, his body was still too weak.\u201cAs expected, I am unable to adapt to the first day of training. But it is just a slow jog. As such, the distance ran must not be reduced. I have to persist.\u201d Lin Yuan gestured with his fist to encourage himself.After taking a shower, he noticed that Genius and Chimey were still in a deep sleep. Genius was even snoring softly.Lin Yuan carefully closed the curtains that had been opened for a very long time. He closed the door on the second floor and went downstairs to prepare for the store opening.At that moment, Lin Yuan noticed that one of the Usnea pots at the corner rack had actually transformed into something different from the other Usnea pots. Normally, Usneas had a tender green color, while the Usnea in that particular pot was dark green. Its vines were twice as thick as average Usnea vines, and its leaves looked firmer too.This pot of Usnea actually evolved over the night!1Lin Yuan used True Data to check on the Usnea\u2019s information, something that was previously unavailable.[Fey Name]: Usnea[Fey Species]: Arum genus/Philodendron genus[Fey Grade]: Normal (3/10)[Fey Type]: Grass[Fey Quality]: Elite\u201cIts quality is actually Elite!\u201d Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.\u201cThis Usnea is indeed incredible\u2026\u201dThis pot of Usnea hadn\u2019t just evolved\u2014its quality had actually progressed too!Lin Yuan felt that this world was truly too mystical.The Usnea might just be a plant rich in nutritions for herbivorous feys, but there were also high-grade Usneas. However, most of the high-grade Usneas were produced using energy ores and other feys, along with huge effort.However, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t use energy ores to nurture the Usneas. He immediately related it to Genius and Chimey\u2019s evolutions and then took another look at the evolved Usnea. He recalled that while he had been absorbing spirit qi the previous day, he had been holding its leaf. As for the other Usneas, they were still the same and didn\u2019t have any changes.5The feys that had evolved had been in contact with him while he had been absorbing spirit qi.Suddenly, Lin Yuan had such a bold thought that sounded unrealistic!Could it be that when I absorb spirit qi, I am not just a funnel? Instead, I can guide the spirit qi through my body and help feys evolve and even increase their quality?3While thinking that, Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help and gulp down a mouthful of saliva.3Fey evolution was an extremely difficult feat. Plenty of contracted feys were stuck at a certain grade for an entire lifetime and wouldn\u2019t be able to evolve. The difficulty of evolving feys was also why Creation Masters were the most respected spirit qi professionals. In fact, it wouldn\u2019t be exaggerating to say it was the world\u2019s most respected occupation.Among the spirit qi occupations, there were combat-class and lifestyle-class spirit qi occupations. The combat-class spirit qi occupations were further categorized into power offense-type, agile offense-type, defense-type, support-type, and healing-type.5The contracted feys mainly determined the types of spirit qi occupations because each spirit qi professional would be compatible with a certain type of fey.After sensing the fey, one would know which type they were more compatible with. As for the feys that weren\u2019t as compatible, even if one had sufficient spiritual energy, it would be challenging to form a contract and might damage the spiritual energy.Among the combat-class spirit qi professionals, the healing-type spirit qi professionals were the rarest. Out of every 100 spirit qi professionals, there might not even be a single healing-type spirit qi professional.There were plenty of lifestyle-class spirit qi occupations too, but Creation Masters were the most respected among all of them.2For combat-class spirit qi professionals to evolve and increase the quality of their fey, apart from those rare natural evolutions, the only other method was to get help from Creation Masters.However, the standard to become a Creation Master was also very high. In the entire federation, there might be fewer than 100 new Creation Masters every year.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBy comparison, becoming a Creation Master was as difficult as ascending to heaven. However, Lin Yuan could use his spirit qi channeling as a skill that was similar to Creation Masters\u2019. In fact, it was even more effective than the standard methods Creation Masters used.Creation Masters used many different medicinal ingredients to guide and induce a fey\u2019s evolution. Nonetheless, during the evolution process, there was a possibility of failure.Lin Yuan was merely channeling spirit qi into the fey\u2019s body through his hands. His method could evolve the fey and increase its quality, and calling it god-like was not an exaggeration!6The evolution of feys was actually similar to a chronic patient consuming medicine. After consuming medicine for a long time, the chronic patient would form a resistance and wouldn\u2019t be able to absorb the medicinal effects.A Creation Master\u2019s method to evolve a fey was the same as providing treatment to a chronic patient. If the fey was unable to absorb the medicinal effects, the Creation Master would use potent medicinal ingredients to form a new concoction for the fey to absorb the medicinal effects.On the other hand, Lin Yuan simplified everything and used the most fundamental method by using his body as a medium. He would take the spirit qi that was stored in the world and use himself as the medium to transfer the spirit qi for the fey to absorb and evolve.Lin Yuan\u2019s method didn\u2019t need to use up as many precious resources as Creation Masters needed. Also, according to the Usnea\u2019s condition, it seemed like the increase of grade and quality didn\u2019t require a long period.\u201cI am going to be rich!\u201d Lin Yuan muttered to himself, while his excitement was displayed through his expressions. At the same time, Lin Yuan understood that his method would definitely be a terrifying piece of news.1Thus, in order to conceal this ability, Lin Yuan would need to pass the Creation Master\u2019s test and obtain the qualification to become a Creation Master.These were just Lin Yuan\u2019s inferred thoughts, so he didn\u2019t open the store in the morning. Instead, he experimented with the rest of the Usneas by repeating what he had done the previous night.1He spent five minutes on each pot. As a result, after a few hours, about 20 pots of Usneas had transformed into a dark green color, just like the first evolved Usnea. They were all normal-grade and their quality was Elite.Lin Yuan chose one of the four pots of Jasmine Lilies and ground his teeth, while his body was rapidly circulating spirit qi for one hour.The Jasmine Lily\u2019s originally emerald green leaves had turned even more verdant. It seemed that half of the emerald green color on the leaves had gathered onto the petals\u2019 tips, making this Jasmine Lily look extraordinary.This meant that the Jasmine Lily had already reached elite-grade.[Fey Name]: Jasmine Lily[Fey Species]: Crassulaceae genus/Aeonium genus[Fey Grade]: Elite (1/10)4[Fey Type]: Wood[Fey Quality]: Normal1Abilities:[Heal]: Recover open wounds.[Fragrance]: The faint and fresh plant fragrance can alleviate anxious mood.Fragrance, the new ability, was considered a very common ability for flower feys. The effects would be enhanced as the fey\u2019s grade increased, and it wasn\u2019t anything outstanding.However, Lin Yuan realized that the Jasmine Lily\u2019s initial ability, Heal, had changed. When it was at normal-grade, Heal could only slowly recover open wounds. Now that it had evolved to the elite-grade, Heal\u2019s effect was enhanced.Lin Yuan was staring blankly at the Elite Jasmine Lily. As a basic healing-type fey, a Jasmine Lily could already be sold for 500 Federation dollars a pot, and this was because Lin Yuan had lowered the price. Larger fey stores would normally set the price of a well-developed, Normal Jasmine Lily to be over 700 dollars. But once a Normal Jasmine Lily evolved into an Elite one, the price would instantly increase by ten times.Although Lin Yuan\u2019s Jasmine Lily had only obtained a mediocre ability at elite-grade, this convention also applied to it. If he placed it on the market for 5,000 dollars, it would probably be snatched instantly.The feys\u2019 prices had always been rather high. Take Lin Yuan\u2019s little store as an example; it only had five pots of Normal Jasmine Lilies before he found this new ability.After staring blankly for a moment, Lin Yuan took a glance at the 20+ pots of Normal Usnea and the Elite Jasmine Lily.Now, he was certain about his ability. His body might not be able to preserve any spirit qi, but he wasn\u2019t useless as he could evolve feys and increase their quality.As such, Lin Yuan slapped his thigh in joy.\u201cIn the end, I am still a transmigrator who hadn\u2019t realized his cheat-like ability until now. Since I coincidentally found out about my cheat, it will allow me to rise to the top!\u201d3At that moment, Lin Yuan heard a knocking sound at the door of the store. He immediately headed over to open and see who was looking for him.After taking two steps forward, Lin Yuan felt that there seemed to be a trace of spirit qi remaining in his body. In the past, no matter how much spirit qi he absorbed, it would rapidly leak out. Could it be that when he helped feys to evolve, he could also improve his spiritual power?If this was really the case, then he would also be able to cultivate and become a spirit qi professional.After opening the store\u2019s door, Lin Yuan noticed Auntie Zhang pushing a wheelchair and standing in front of his store. An aged uncle, who had a mix of black and white hair, was seated in the wheelchair.Upon seeing Lin Yuan open the door, the aged uncle spoke with a hoarse voice. \u201cLittle Yuan, your Auntie Zhang is bringing me to the doctor. We will be away for three months, just like usual. If you have anything you are having trouble with, give a call to Auntie Zhang.\u201d1Lin Yuan looked at Uncle Li, who was sitting in the wheelchair nonchalantly. Although his lower leg was wrapped with gauze, which was permeated with purplish-black blood, Uncle Li looked as if he wasn\u2019t the one that was injured.A few years back, Lin Yuan had visited Auntie Zhang and had witnessed how she had changed the bandages for Uncle Li. There had seemed to be something hidden within the flesh of Uncle Li\u2019s leg, and it looked extremely sinister and frightening.Auntie Zhang used her hand to knock on Uncle Li\u2019s head and said, \u201cLittle Yuan is much more sensible than you. Do you even need to remind him?\u201dThe wound was secreting rotting blood, but Uncle Li didn\u2019t look like he could feel it. However, after Auntie Zhang knocked on his head, Uncle Li couldn\u2019t help but rub his head. He looked just like an obedient punching bag.After knocking on Uncle Li\u2019s head, Auntie Zhang said to Lin Yuan, \u201cLittle Yuan, my mobile phone will be constantly switched on. If you encounter any problem, you have to give me a call immediately, no matter what time it is!\u201dLin Yuan nodded to Auntie Zhang and Uncle Li. \u201cUncle, Auntie, don\u2019t worry.\u201dAuntie Zhang gave Lin Yuan plenty of reminders and then started to push the wheelchair toward the road intersection while still feeling worried. The Terror Rabbit, which was used as a cushion for Uncle Li, then shook its ears at Lin Yuan as if bidding farewell.1Uncle Li is going for his treatment more than one month in advance. It looks like his leg injury is getting worse.Lin Yuan had used True Data to check on Uncle Li\u2019s leg injury. Uncle Li\u2019s leg injury was actually caused by a type of bone-gangrene poison and not some physical wound.2This type of poison was biological, and it even carried spirit-curse effects. True Data\u2019s displayed information stated that the poison originated from a poisonous worm called Bone-Rotting Filarial Worm.The Bone-Rotting Filarial Worm was a type of very evil fey. Even the weakest Bone-Rotting Filarial Worm was Platinum, and they were extremely rare.The Bone-Rotting Filarial Worm would normally attack with a poison named Bone-Rotting Poison, but it wasn\u2019t the bone-gangrene\u2019s cause. In order to form the bone-gangrene poison, the Bone-Rotting Filarial Worm would have to dig into the target\u2019s flesh and sacrifice itself. It would then turn its lifeforce into a type of poison, forming the bone-gangrene.Evidently, the bone-gangrene was a very horrifying poison.Uncle Li has been enduring and sealing this poison inside his lower leg for so many years\u2026 Could it be that Uncle Li\u2019s spirit qi occupation is king-class!?4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe world was very big. A century after the Spirit Qi Awakening, scholars predicted that the planet had expanded by at least 100 times. Everyone wanted to understand more about this world when they were still alive, and it was the same for Lin Yuan.9That\u2019s why every step taken must be firm and steady.After Auntie Zhang and Uncle Li walked far away, Lin Yuan returned to the store and closed the door. He wasn\u2019t planning to open for business today. Before this, Lin Yuan had always been a sickly person, and he hadn\u2019t had sufficient spiritual energy or stamina to conduct a larger scale business for his store.However, things were different now. Lin Yuan planned to clean up the courtyard at the back. He was going to clean up the tables in the courtyard and stack them up to use as a storage area for feys.Before doing that, he carried the racks that he didn\u2019t use before and placed them in the store, allowing for more feys to be displayed. After all, Lin Yuan now had the energy to tend to more feys.Also, tending to feys and making them evolve was the only method for Lin Yuan to enhance his spiritual power.After packing and cleaning the courtyard for an entire afternoon, Lin Yuan was so tired that he couldn\u2019t even say a word. He sat on the chair for a long period before feeling alive again.At that moment, the door that Lin Yuan had closed tightly on the second floor was gently opened. Soon, a meowing and a chirping sound echoed. The chirping sound was much more pleasant than before.Evidently, Genius had realized that it had evolved and swiftly ran down from the second floor. It then jumped onto Lin Yuan\u2019s legs and said, \u201cYuan, Chimey and I seem to have evolved!\u201dGenius was a fey of the Intelligent Cat species. The main reason it was called a housekeeping beast was that the Hundred Questions Beasts could converse well with humans. In addition, they were just like encyclopedias that could store a lot of information.Lin Yuan reached out and rubbed Genius\u2019 head. Upon doing that, he realized that Genius\u2019 new grayish silver fur was much thicker than before. Furthermore, it had a sort of density, unlike before, when it had been sparse.In other words, the Hundred Questions Beast\u2019s fur had evolved to normal-grade, and its defense had been enhanced.Chimey\u2019s spirituality wasn\u2019t as good as Genius\u2019, so it still didn\u2019t know what was happening. Chimey felt that it had slept for a long time, and it was a little embarrassed. It was standing beside Lin Yuan\u2019s ear and gently pecking at his short hair.Upon seeing that Lin Yuan was rubbing Genius, Chimey hopped onto Genius\u2019 head and imitated Lin Yuan\u2019s action as it used its small talon to stroke Genius\u2019 fur.Before this, Chimey wouldn\u2019t act like that. Lin Yuan could see that Chimey\u2019s evolution had significantly enhanced its intelligence.\u201cGenius, do you feel anything different after you evolved?\u201d While Lin Yuan was speaking, he used True Data to check on Genius.[Fey Name]: Hundred Questions Beast[Fey Species]: Cat species/Intelligent Cat species[Fey Grade]: Normal (2/10)[Fey Type]: Spiritual[Fey Quality]: NormalAbilities:[Precise Memory]: When memorizing something, every single detail can be memorized with precision.5Precise Memory was a very contradictory ability. If Genius was unable to memorize many things in the past, then Precise Memory wouldn\u2019t make any difference.However, if Genius could already memorize many things before gaining this ability, then Precise Memory\u2019s capability was something that Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t dare to imagine.Genius let out a meow and said, \u201cYuan, I feel that I can memorize more things than before. If my memory was just a piece of red braised meat before, then my memory now is as big as 30 pieces of red braised meat!\u201d7Lin Yuan had yet to eat anything today. When he heard Genius\u2019 explanation that used food as an analogy, he suddenly felt extremely hungry. However, the starving sensation didn\u2019t take away Lin Yuan\u2019s attention.Genius\u2019 memory allowed it to memorize the contents of around three to five books in the past. If Genius\u2019 memory had really increased thirtyfold, it meant that Genius could at least memorize the contents of around 100 books. Furthermore, it could even remember things in detail!Lin Yuan had been worried about how he was going to pass the Creation Master\u2019s exam.The contents of the Creation Master\u2019s exam was to evolve a fey, which had reached its evolution bottleneck. It might sound simple, but some preconditions must be met to take the exam.The precondition to take the Creation Master\u2019s exam was to pass the primary exams for three lifestyle occupations. After obtaining the proof that one passed the three lifestyle occupations\u2019 primary exams, one would then be able to apply for the Creation Master\u2019s exam.1There were plenty of lifestyle occupations, but it wasn\u2019t easy to pass the exams.Lifestyle-class occupations, such as Blacksmiths that forged energy ores or Weavers that created silk fabrics, were all occupations that required one to have a good foundation from a young age.Forging and weaving with feys wasn\u2019t like the normal forging and weaving processes before the Spirit Qi Awakening. In the past, one would only need strength and nimble hands to complete the tasks.Like Blacksmiths and Weavers, lifestyle occupations required an understanding of feys before they could use the forging or weaving methods to allow spiritual ingredients to fuse with each other.If Lin Yuan wanted to obtain the Creation Master\u2019s exam qualifications, these kinds of lifestyle-class occupations were obviously not within his capabilities.Lin Yuan had an alternative now that Genius had evolved and obtained an ability.There were three lifestyle-class spirit qi occupations\u2019 exams that focused on knowledge. They were the Scholar, Fey Observer, and Spiritual Ingredient Analyst. These three lifestyle-class occupations were all knowledge-based.Due to the knowledge-based exams and how seriously knowledge and research were treated, the exams\u2019 standards were very strict.In each exam, one would have to answer 500 questions, and their overall score was 1,000 points. Each correct answer would award 2 points, unanswered questions would award nothing, and every wrong answer would deduct 4 points!This type of exam was trying to warn those who wanted to become researchers and scholars that they should skip the question if they didn\u2019t know the answers or were unclear. However, they must not be ambiguous and guess the answers.Furthermore, one needed at least 900 points to pass the exams.These exams might seem easy, but they were not. Putting aside the fact that the questions were crafty, if one were to answer one question wrongly, they would lose the points of two correct answers!Moreover, if one were to fail the exam, they would only be able to apply for the exam after one entire year.Due to all these reasons, the primary exams for these three lifestyle-class occupations were the least chosen. However, others might find these three exams difficult, but they were the most suitable for Lin Yuan.I just have to get Genius to memorize the primary books on the Scholar, Fey Observer, and Spiritual Ingredient Analyst occupation before attempting for the exam.1During the past century, housekeeping beasts had already become personal pets and were used as lifestyle assistants. When taking the lifestyle-class occupation exams, the examinees were allowed to bring housekeeping beasts, like the Hundred Questions Beast, as assistants.However, there were also exceptions, like the Creation Master\u2019s exam, which didn\u2019t allow the examinees to bring in anything, not even spiritual ingredients, apart from themselves. They were only allowed to use the spiritual ingredients provided in the exam venue.Despite the case, this was simply a child\u2019s play for Lin Yuan.During the exam, he just had to pour his spirit qi into the fey\u2019s body to successfully pass.11One had to admit that as the Radiance Federation\u2019s first Hundred Questions Beast, which had evolved into a Normal fey, Genius\u2019 ability was truly convenient and too timely!2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 10": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yuan knew that if he didn\u2019t have a reasonable explanation for his ability to evolve feys, it would certainly bring in trouble.As the saying went, \u201cAn outstanding tree will definitely be blown down by the wind. If a tree is too tall, the winds will never allow it to survive.\u201dIt was just like how a prodigy would have a halo over their head, but jealous people would always accompany them.In addition, he couldn\u2019t attribute his ability to him being a prodigy. Not to mention that his strength was still budding at the surface of the ground. If he were careless and exposed himself to the fierce winds, he might wither in an instant.The path to becoming a Creation Master was something that Lin Yuan had to take. Therefore, he was planning to purchase some books, which were related to the primary exams for the Scholar, Fey Observer, and Spiritual Ingredient Analyst, on the Star Web.It should be enough for Genius\u2019 capacity to memorize 100 books.3However, Lin Yuan also had things to fret about as those books weren\u2019t cheap.After the Spirit Qi Awakening, the internet had been crippled for over a dozen years before it had recovered. At the same time, the internet had undergone a revolution. The network was like a large-scale virtual world and was known as the Federation Star Web.8When entering the Federation Star Web, everyone would need to bind themselves with a federation citizen identity. The Star Web had entertainment, live streaming, virtual transactions, interactive and social contacting, or even ranking battles. During the last few decades, the Federation Star Web development was already able to support a second world for the Radiance Federation\u2019s citizens.5As for the books that Lin Yuan required, they could be purchased in the Federation Star Web\u2019s bookshop.These books were all published by high-ranked Scholars, Fey Observers, and Spiritual Ingredient Analysts. Each of these books had an average price of around 100 Federation dollars.For every book that the bookshop sold, the publisher would earn a profit of around 15%. That\u2019s why the income of a lifestyle-class professional was always commendable.A total of 100 books would cost around 10,000 Federation dollars in total, and that amount was almost Lin Yuan\u2019s entire wealth. Moreover, a large portion of this wealth had to be reserved for his younger sister\u2019s next year\u2019s school fees.Lin Yuan remembered that his young sister\u2019s school curriculum was about to start with fey contract classes. The fey contract classes were normally leaning toward actual combat. That\u2019s why he had to find a suitable high-grade fey for his younger sister first.\u201cI am still very poor!\u201d Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help lamenting.1Right now, there is nothing else more important that I need to do than to earn more money. I already have a clear direction, but this direction will need Federation dollars to remove the obstacle.1When Genius saw Lin Yuan frowning in his thoughts, it immediately pounced into Lin Yuan\u2019s embrace along with Chimey on its head.The Hundred Questions Beast, Genius, might have evolved, but deep in its bones, Lin Yuan was still the most important person. When Genius was around Lin Yuan, it would always feel warmth and a steady sense of security.Chimey was still standing on Genius\u2019 head. Perhaps it could feel the changes in its body, so it started to chirp a song cheerfully.Chimey had failed to evolve into a Songstress Bird, and at the beginning, it didn\u2019t know how to sing. After receiving Lin Yuan\u2019s guidance, it was finally able to learn one song.In this world, Lin Yuan had only heard a few songs and naturally didn\u2019t know how to sing them. Therefore, the song that Lin Yuan had taught to Chimey was a song that he had composed by taking reference to a poem before transmigrating to this world.3In the past, Lin Yuan might always be praising Chimey when it was singing, but Chimey was singing a saliva song and couldn\u2019t bring out any flavor.But now, when Chimey sang the song again, Lin Yuan felt as if it was a phoenix calling in the Kunlun Mountains, and hibiscuses and orchids were blooming with a smile.Lin Yuan felt that he had suddenly entered a plain, where there was a horizon of grassland, and orioles were flying. The jingling spring water served as the zither, the wind blowing on the willows served as a tune, while the morning dew dripping served as the screenplay.2It felt as though a bean goose was walking through the snow, and when Lin Yuan tried to look for the bean goose, it had vanished without a trace. Only the goose\u2019s footprints on the snow served as proof that it was truly there. The places where the bean goose had stepped on suddenly bloomed with wintersweet, and there was an appealing and beautiful image of a woman that was holding a book and reciting with a frown.2\u201cTrees suffer from frost, their roots unable to draw warmth.A single blossom in a snow-covered village appeared last night.The wind wafts the fragrance while the birds take a peek at its brilliance.\u201dThe winter and summer shared the beautiful scenery, and Lin Yuan was able to visualize this scenery because of Chimey\u2019s singing.If Chimey\u2019s voice was like a child playing around previously, then now, Chimey\u2019s voice was truly worthy for the palace, and it was at the pinnacle.It seemed like Chimey\u2014the only Sound Bird that had reached normal-grade\u2014had great control over tunes.As Chimey continued singing, it realized that its voice sounded better, so it flapped its wings happily and flew around the house.Lin Yuan checked on Chimey\u2019s True Data.[Fey Name]: Sound Bird[Fey Species]: Corvidae species/Kingfisher species2[Fey Grade]: Normal (3/10)[Fey Type]: Sound1[Fey Quality]: NormalAbilities:[Sound Thrust]: Fire a sharp spike that is formed by sound at a designated target.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect Chimey to be a combat-class pet.Lin Yuan immediately called out to Chimey and instructed, \u201cChimey, launch a Sound Thrust at the wooden panel by the door!\u201dWhen Chimey heard Lin Yuan\u2019s command, it instinctively let out a distinct chirp. At the same time, Lin Yuan noticed that the wooden panel by the door had shivered a little.Lin Yuan walked over to take a look and noticed that the one-centimeter-thick wooden panel hadn\u2019t gotten penetrated. However, there was a white mark left on the wooden panel, not a shallow one at that.Lin Yuan rubbed the white mark while mentally calculating Chimey\u2019s attack force. He speculated that its driving force was probably around three kilograms.11Although such an attack force wasn\u2019t considered outstanding among Normal feys, the attack method was superior as it was formless and invisible. It had a very fast attack speed, making it hard to dodge.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but think,\u00a0If I can continue nurturing Genius and Chimey, I wonder what they will become\u20265Given his current ability, would there be a day when Genius and Chimey would evolve from normal-grade to elite-grade? Would they be able to continue evolving from Elite to Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, or even Suzerain, which possessed a domain?Or was there the possibility that during the process of evolution, Genius and Chimey\u2019s quality would reach Legend, transforming them into Fantasy Breeds?3Fantasy Breed had always been a sacred term in the fey world. Fantasy Breed meant that the fey was supposed to only exist in fantasies and not in reality.When a Bronze fey\u2019s quality reached Legend, it might absorb certain Willpower Runes from mountains, rivers, oceans, or even the sky. It would allow the fey to achieve a qualitative change, and only high-ranked Creation Masters could utilize such methods.Lin Yuan felt that if his ability could continue performing like its current state, he might be able to do the same in the future.However, presently, Lin Yuan had to visit the fey marketplace to pick a certain type of fey to form a contract with Morbius\u2019 Spirit Lock skill.6Simultaneously, he had to strive to make Chimey and Genius\u2019 qualities to achieve Epic before they evolved to bronze-grade.A fey\u2019s quality was ranked as followed: Normal, Elite, Flawless, Epic, and Legend. When an\u00a0Elite/Epic1\u00a0fey became Bronze, it would undergo a gene optimization.2The so-called gene optimization was to awaken a skill.There were all sorts of fey skills, and the skill awakened was random. Therefore, plenty of feys awakened very weak skills or skills that were incompatible with the spirit qi occupation when they evolved from elite-grade to bronze-grade.After the Bronze fey\u2019s gene optimization, its quality would fall back to Normal and had to be increased from the beginning. However, if an Elite fey could increase its quality to Epic before evolving, it would obtain three different skill choices.5The contracted fey\u2019s master could choose one of the skills. Fey contacts couldn\u2019t be exchanged, so it was the same as giving the contracted master two additional chances.In conclusion, having three choices to pick was definitely better than not having any choice to pick.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 11": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAlthough it was daytime and the lights were switched off, the house appeared to be pitch-dark.Li Yuan switched on the lights before moving swiftly to the kitchen to boil a pot of vegetable porridge. Mixed with white rice grains were plenty of green vegetables of varying sizes. Although he had only added salt, the rice grains and vegetables\u2019 aroma was already making Lin Yuan\u2019s stomach grumble as he had not eaten for an entire day.Chimney was eating its Usnea as usual. However, since the Usneas had evolved to normal-grade, and Chimey had never tasted such nice food before, it ate much more than usual. While Chimey was eating, it used its wings to rub on its bulging tummy.5Lin Yuan had a big bowl of vegetable porridge, while Genius had a small one. They were both enjoying their food.After Auntie Zhang\u2019s departure, Chimey no longer needed to restrain itself anymore, so it had been singing for the entire night. Chimey might only know one song, but its singing voice was enjoyable.Genius behaved the same, resting on Lin Yuan, while he was working hard to guide the three pots of Jasmine Lilies to evolve.2\u2026Three hours after breakfast, Lin Yuan\u2019s efforts finally paid off as the three pots of Jasmine Lilies had successfully evolved from normal-grade to elite-grade.Lin Yuan realized that after a fey evolved to elite-grade, it would take much more time for it to make any progress in evolution. After two more hours of hard work, the Elite I Jasmine Lilies levelled up by 1 grade. There was no difference in quality.2It seems like, with my current strength, I will need very long to evolve the feys from Elite to Bronze. The feys\u2019 evolution speed is dependent on my spirit qi absorption speed. If I wish to increase my spirit qi absorption speed, I will need to become a spirit qi professional.Now that he had evolved three more Normal feys to Elite ones, Lin Yuan felt that his stamina and spiritual power were much stronger. If this carried on, and if he evolved 200 more pots of Jasmine Lilies from normal-grade to elite-grade, he might be able to become the lowest-ranked, D-rank, spirit qi professional.3By then, his spirit qi absorption would be much faster, and it would be easier for him to evolve feys.Lin Yuan was about to evolve a pot of Normal Usnea to become his store\u2019s first Elite Usnea when his old-fashioned mobile phone rang.Lin Yuan looked at the mobile phone screen and revealed a warm smile. The moment he picked up the phone, he heard a clear and pleasant voice.\u201cElder brother, it has been two days since I called you. How is your body now?\u201d It was a familiar opening statement. Whenever Lin Yuan answered his younger sister\u2019s phone call, she would always ask this as though it was a habit.\u201cMy body is much better than before. You don\u2019t have to worry! I have even cleaned up our house\u2019s courtyard at the back.\u201d\u201cElder brother, why are you cleaning our house\u2019s courtyard for? Your body\u2026\u201dChu Ci sounded anxious as she knew clearly about her elder brother\u2019s body condition.4From the tender age of 8 and 6, Lin Yuan and she had been relying on each other to survive.3The 8-year-old Lin Yuan had spared no effort to ensure their survival. They had already tested the 6-year-old Chu Ci, who had an exceptional talent to become a spirit qi professional, so he had been determined to support her studies. It had been nine years since then.8One could imagine how much hard work an 8-year-old frail child had to put in order to endure when he actually required care from others.4After hearing that Lin Yuan had cleaned up the courtyard, his sister knew he was planning to expand the store\u2019s scale to earn more money. But how could his body take it?Chu Ci had thought about stopping school in order to help Lin Yuan at home. In fact, she had even protested by doing her homework poorly and getting bad grades on her tests.However, during one rainy night, Lin Yuan looked at her with red eyes and said, \u201cChu Ci, you are my only family, do not disappoint me.\u201dChu Ci could still remember that when Lin Yuan had made that statement, he had been actually yelling, and this yell had woken up Chu Ci. She had discarded all of her rebellious behavior and turned into a top-class student that always ranked first in the exams from that day onward. It was all because she didn\u2019t wish to disappoint Lin Yuan.2After listening to Lin Yuan\u2019s plans, Chu Ci got anxious. At the same time, Lin Yuan could sense his younger sister\u2019s emotional state through the phone.\u201cI am just packing up a little. The store is still the same.\u201dLin Yuan did think of telling Chu Ci that he could sense spirit qi, but he was afraid that she wouldn\u2019t be convinced and would still be anxious. He thought that he would talk to Chu Ci during the school holidays.However, Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t tell Chu Ci about the fact that he could evolve feys. It wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t trust her. He simply didn\u2019t wish for this secret to be exposed and bring danger to Chu Ci.3When Chu Ci heard Lin Yuan speaking like this, she finally relaxed. This pair of siblings wasn\u2019t adept at expressing their hidden feelings, and they were both people that had a burning passion in the depths of their hearts. Therefore, after they mutually informed each other that they were fine, the conversation ended quickly.11After Chu Ci ended the phone call, she heard her roommate\u2019s envious voice from behind. \u201cIt seems like you have a rather good relationship with your elder brother! Unlike my younger brother and I that are at loggerheads whenever I get home. But you have the surname of Chu, while your elder brother has the surname of Lin. That is rather strange.\u201d6Chu Ci smiled and reflected a warm atmosphere in the room. Lin Yuan had taken the Lin surname from their father, while she had taken the Chu surname from their mother. This was the love between their father and mother. It was also the parental love from her parents that had left a very vague impression in Chu Ci\u2019s memory.14\u201cChu Ci, we are going to contract feys tomorrow. Why don\u2019t you go out for a walk with me to relax?\u201dChu Ci shook her head, pointed at the revision book on her table, and shook her hands.The roommate used a habitual tone and said, \u201cYou! Do you only know how to revise in the room? If I had your looks, I would be going out every day! Do you know how many students in the school fancy you!?\u201d5When the roommate saw that Chu Ci wasn\u2019t interested in going out, she left the room herself thinking that she might find some nice man.3Chu Ci picked up her pen and started to write neatly on the revision book. She didn\u2019t even pause as she memorized this question by heart.Chu Ci didn\u2019t repeatedly practice these questions for herself. It was for a part-time job. For each revision book she did, she could earn 20 Federation dollars. It wasn\u2019t any problem for Chu Ci to write out two to three sets of revision books.In fact, this was also Chu Ci\u2019s study method. Each revision book cost 40 Federation dollars, and Chu Ci couldn\u2019t afford it. Due to her part-time job, she simultaneously could practice and earn some allowance. It was truly killing two birds with one stone.10This was also the first year Chu Ci had a part-time job, and it was something that she didn\u2019t dare to let Lin Yuan know. If Lin Yuan found out, he would probably be angry!1What\u2019s more, Chu Ci didn\u2019t use the money to pay for her school fees. She was planning to buy some medicinal health products for Lin Yuan when she returned during the holidays.3While having this motivation, she started to fill the revision book. Her hand might be feeling sore, but Chu Ci didn\u2019t feel tired at all.At that moment, a banging sound came from Chu Ci\u2019s drawer.When Chu Ci opened the drawer, she glanced at a box with a thick shell inside. There was a gray-colored and ugly beetle that was the size of half a palm.4Tomorrow they would learn how to form a contract with a fey and then apply the knowledge with their first fey.Naturally, Chu Ci didn\u2019t inform Lin Yuan about that. She had used her own hard-earned money to find a Gray Beetle, who no one in the entire federation would wish to form a contract with.4Chu Ci looked at the Gray Beetle and gripped her fist tightly. She had a calm and determined expression as though she had made a decision.7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 12": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThat night, Lin Yuan slept well with Genius and Chimey snuggling close to him. Even in their sleep, they continued to absorb the spirit qi that he was emitting.Lin Yuan woke up to his morning routine and exercised for one hour before opening the store at 7 a.m. Soon enough, all the Elite Usneas were sold out.1The supply of nutritious food, such as Usneas, for herbivorous feys was always lower than the demand. In addition, Lin Yuan\u2019s Usneas were in great condition, and their prices were affordable.2Lin Yuan had even successfully managed to sell a pot of Elite Jasmine Lily, earning a total of 5,500 Federation dollars, while selling the Usneas.Lin Yuan earned an amount that was more than what he would make during an average month in just one morning!5Without including the Usneas, just that one pot of Jasmine Lily earned him more than what he had made last month. Thus, Lin Yuan was delighted.When Lin Yuan was about to purchase more goods from the fey marketplace, his mobile phone rang. It was an unknown number.The moment Lin Yuan answered the call, an anxious and furious voice resounded.\u201cAre you Chu Ci\u2019s guardian!?\u201dLin Yuan immediately replied after hearing the question, \u201cI am. Did something happen to Chu Ci in school? And you are?\u201dThat person was extremely impolite and started showering him with criticisms.\u201cWho am I? I am Chu Ci\u2019s homeroom teacher, Teacher Bao! What kind of guardian are you? During the fey contract class, Chu Ci actually contracted a Gray Beetle and even suffered a backlash!2\u201cAs a guardian, don\u2019t you know that you should provide a better fey for your kin!? What piece of trash is the Gray Beetle? Don\u2019t you know that you are wasting Chu Ci\u2019s exceptional talent!?\u201d2Under normal circumstances, teachers would be very polite when communicating with parents. However, this Teacher Bao was outraged.When Lin Yuan heard what Teacher Bao said, cold sweat instantly drenched his back and clothes.How could Lin Yuan not be aware of Gray Beetles? They were Normal feys that could be bought for 200 Federation dollars. Due to Gray Beetle\u2019s aggressive nature, it would be in an aggressive state during the contracting process, and the contractor would suffer a backlash.At the same time, the Gray Beetle\u2019s excavating ability was utterly useless as it was of no help to a combat occupation.Gray Beetles preferred environments that were dark and moist, while their main diet was rotting flesh. Due to their habits and preferences, the Gray Beetle ranked number one as the fey that no one was willing to form a contract with.Presently, Gray Beetles were mostly used as food for high-grade carnivorous feys.Lin Yuan\u2019s voice was unstable as he asked Teacher Bao, \u201cTeacher Bao, is Chu Ci okay now?!\u201d He was gripping the mobile phone so tightly that the veins in his hands were popping out.The other end of the phone call transmitted a very dissatisfied voice. \u201cDue to the timely rescue in class, she only suffered a minor mental backlash and is unconscious. It is fortunate that she didn\u2019t manage to form a contract with the Gray Beetle.1\u201cChu Ci has the best talent among all the students that I have taught. Her compatibility range is toward all defensive-type feys. Her aptitude is very rare, even in the entire Redbud City.\u201cIf she is properly nurtured, she might even have the chance to strive and enter the federation\u2019s Hundred Sequence. This is the kind of talent that guardians like you should pay more attention to.\u201d2Teacher Bao might be angry while speaking, but he didn\u2019t forget about his job responsibility and preached about education ideals.Upon hearing that Chu Ci was fine, Lin Yuan heaved a sigh of relief and quickly asked, \u201cTeacher Bao, is Chu Ci still unconscious? I will come right now!\u201dTeacher Bao immediately instructed, \u201cIf you come, then you\u2019d better have with you an outstanding Elite fey for Chu Ci. Otherwise, it will really be wasting her talents.\u201d7A spirit qi professional\u2019s talent was referring to the compatibility between the spirit qi professional and the feys. It was also known as the compatibility range.There were spirit qi professionals who might be compatible with support-type feys, but when trying to connect with support-type feys, they might only be compatible with snake-species feys. Therefore, they could only form contracts with snake support-type feys.As a result, the compatibility range would shrink significantly. A spirit qi professional could only form contracts with around three to five feys. However, due to compatibility, it would be difficult to find three feys that fit the criteria.This referred to individuals with average talent. It was possible for people with poor talent\u2014compatible with snake support-type feys\u2014to have an additional compatibility condition, that being venomous snakes. This would definitely shrink the compatibility range down even more.If the search for compatible feys was already so difficult, there wasn\u2019t a need to even discuss contracting more feys to form one\u2019s combat system.For a combat-class spirit qi professional, the combination of feys was crucial.Spirit qi professionals fought using the combinations and pairings with many types of feys to produce a complementing effect. Thus, the wider the compatibility range, the easier it was to form combinations.In fact, some individuals would only nurture one of the feys with the majority of the resources, while the other feys were used to enhance this main fey.This was one of the federation\u2019s effective methods to save on resources, and it was a strategy to funnel resources to the main fey.Given all these factors, it was evident how talented Chu Ci was.Lin Yuan replied, \u201cTeacher, don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll visit the school tomorrow and bring a fey for Chu Chi.\u201d4Although Lin Yuan was angry at Chu Ci in his heart, he could also understand her thoughts. Soon, his anger turned into heartache.It was good that he would visit her this time. Lin Yuan would show her that he could now absorb spiritual power and prove that his body condition was much better than before. This would allow Chu Ci to feel more at ease.4Lin Yuan\u2019s great attitude reduced Teacher Bao\u2019s anger significantly. However, he still reminded, \u201cIt is best to bring an Elite fey.\u201d6Subsequently, the phone call ended.Teacher Bao let out a long sigh in the office after he hung up the phone.He might have only taught Chu Ci for two weeks, but Chu Ci\u2019s serious attitude in studies had moved him. A teacher would always prefer diligent students, and because of her potential, it led Teacher Bao to give more preference to Chu Ci.2As a teacher, he knew a little about his student\u2019s family background. Teacher Bao had heard that Chu Ci\u2019s family wasn\u2019t well-off, so he wasn\u2019t expecting Lin Yuan to bring over an Elite fey.5Teacher Bao touched his salary card in his pocket and gritted his teeth.If Chu Ci\u2019s guardian bring a Normal fey, I will fork out from my own pocket to purchase an Elite fey for her. I cannot allow Chu Ci\u2019s incredible talent to be wasted like this.12Lin Yuan stayed silent for a very long time after ending the phone call. He only snapped back to his senses when Genius called out to him.Upon looking at the three remaining pots of Elite Jasmine Lilies, one pot of Elite Usnea, and 20+ pots of Normal Usneas, Lin Yuan immediately dismissed the plan to visit the fey marketplace.He immediately closed the store.Lin Yuan intended to work overnight to evolve all these Normal Usneas to Elite ones. He was planning to sell all of them in the fey marketplace tomorrow, in exchange for a top-notch Elite defense-type fey for his younger sister.8Lin Yuan worked hard for an entire night to channel the spirit qi to 20+ pots of Normal Usneas. Although he felt fatigued and exhausted, he didn\u2019t rest for a moment. In the end, he evolved all of them into elite-grade. Yet again, Lin Yuan felt the accumulated spiritual power in his body getting strengthened.\u2026It was daylight outside the window\u2014over 20 hours had passed, and it was already the next day!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 13": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter not sleeping for an entire night, Lin Yuan felt he had returned to the time when he couldn\u2019t sense the spirit qi and when his spiritual energy was still in a frail state.Lin Yuan shook his head, feeling that this frail state was very familiar, but he didn\u2019t have the time to rest now.Lin Yuan ran upstairs and opened a wooden box that was rather old. It contained plenty of plain and simple youth clothes. The denim clothes on the top of the clothing pile had a blue color that had already faded.Lin Yuan took out all the clothes, and a card appeared at the bottom of the box. It was a Star Web Card.The Radiance Federation would only issue one Star Web Card for each citizen. It was a genuine smart card, and it included the function of a bank card.This little card contained all of Lin Yuan\u2019s wealth, and when adding yesterday\u2019s profit, he had close to 20,000 Federation dollars.Genius was crouching obediently at the side of the bed and meowed to Lin Yuan before saying, \u201cYuan, it will probably rain later. Let me accompany you!\u201dLin Yuan rubbed Genius\u2019 head and pointed at the bed where Chimey was still snoring away. \u201cGenius, you and Chimey have accompanied me for an entire night. You should also have a rest. A Genius that rests obediently is a good Genius.\u201dGenius immediately let out a purr, lay beside Chimey, and said to Lin Yuan, \u201cGenius is a good Genius.\u201dLin Yuan took the umbrella and locked the store properly before heading toward the fey marketplace.The weather was already stiflingly hot, so the sparkling drizzle\u2019s addition made the atmosphere abnormally humid. Redbud City\u2019s residents were already familiar with such weather.The fey marketplace wasn\u2019t close to Lin Yuan\u2019s home and was around a seven-kilometer journey away.During normal times, Lin Yuan would walk there to purchase new goods. Given Lin Yuan\u2019s previous body condition, he would need to walk at least for two hours to travel seven kilometers. However, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have that much time.He had already promised the teacher that he would deliver a fey to the school for Chu Ci to form a contract. Furthermore, Lin Yuan was worried about Chu Ci\u2019s safety. If he didn\u2019t have to prepare the fey, he would have already visited Chu Ci.After walking to a transportation station that wasn\u2019t far away, Lin Yuan used the Star Web Card to register and arranged for a Thick-Hoofed Donkey Car.The Thick-Hoofed Donkey was a Normal fey. Due to its fast walking speed, it was available as the cheapest form of public transportation that was commonly used and found in every corner of the Radiance Federation. A century after the Spirit Qi Awakening, various feys had already evolved to replace the majority of the steel machines.However, it didn\u2019t stop the Radiance Federation from advancing their technology. On the contrary, after the Spirit Qi Awakening, humanity\u2019s technology had advanced greatly, and the Star Web was the best proof.Lin Yuan was seated in the Thick-Hoofed Donkey Car. The breeze that accompanied the galloping Thick-Hoofed Donkey invigorated Lin Yuan, making him comfortable from time to time.Ever since Lin Yuan had boarded the vehicle, the driver had constantly been looking at Lin Yuan. Upon seeing that Lin Yuan had already noticed him, the driver gave a friendly greeting. \u201cYoung Brother, are you going to purchase a fey at the marketplace? I have already taken plenty of trips to the marketplace today.\u201dLin Yuan let out a smile when the driver started conversing with him.\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u00a0Master1. I am going to the marketplace to take a look. Why have you taken so many trips to the marketplace?\u201dLin Yuan was only casually asking to carry on the topic with the driver.It felt as though the driver was waiting for Lin Yuan to ask this question and started to speak nonstop.\u201cThis is definitely not a coincidence. It is because there is an additional shipment to the marketplace today.\u201dUpon seeing how the driver was acting mysteriously, Lin Yuan felt curious too. Drivers who were fetching plenty of customers on a daily basis would always have first-hand information.The driver was also a forthright person and didn\u2019t try to be suspenseful. He immediately started talking. \u201cYoung Brother, have you read the news during these two days? Do you know that a dimensional rift opened around 15 kilometers away from our Xia Region\u2019s outskirts?\u201dLin Yuan didn\u2019t expect the topic on the marketplace to be related to the dimensional rift in the outskirts.However, whenever there was a dimensional rift, it was a major event for the Radiance Federation. Dimensional rifts would be connected with another dimension plane. Take this dimensional rift, for example. It was actually connected to a plane that was filled with alien insects.Redbud City had immediately mobilized the Redbud Guards and sent them to the outskirts.The Redbud Guards had spent two entire days to wipe out the alien insects that rushed out from the dimensional rift and controlled the situation.The news outlets had constantly been reporting on this incident. It was said that the Redbud Guards had left three platoons at the vicinity of the dimensional rift to stand guard.After looking at Lin Yuan\u2019s expression, the driver understood that Lin Yuan knew of this matter, and it instantly sparked his desire to continue speaking.\u201cThe dimensional rift this time didn\u2019t show any prior indications, and it just happened to open nearby a small-scaled fey breeding base. As a result, when the alien insects invaded, the breeding base was devastated. I heard that only a few of the staff members managed to escape. When the rescue team arrived, there were only a few feys that were still intact. However, some feys were severely injured and not dead yet. As such, the staff members that escaped set up a stall in the marketplace to sell off the injured and crippled feys.\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s eyes lit up after hearing that. Severely injured and crippled feys would definitely not be too expensive, and there might be a chance to pick up a great fey.\u201cMaster, then can you bring me to the nearest crossing to that stall? I will alight from there and take a look too.\u201dThe driver chuckled and said, \u201cAlright, Young Brother! However, I heard from others that those feys\u2019 injuries are so severe that they damaged their roots. Healers do not have the ability to heal the roots. In order to heal those severely injured feys, you will have to go look for Creation Masters.\u201dAfter speaking, the driver let out a sigh.\u201cThe fees required to look for a Creation Master for treatment is probably enough to purchase a brand new fey.\u201d Lin Yuan cracked a rare joke as he had already recovered and was in a much better mood.\u201cBeast is sliced, the pot is spiced, the entire village waits in delight. If it truly can\u2019t be treated, let it become marinated.\u201dLin Yuan was only joking and didn\u2019t expect the driver to actually follow up.\u201cDish is served, the stomachs are starved, all the villagers are no longer reserved.\u201cYesterday, I picked up a cheap Elite Blunt Armor Pig from that stall, and it is now hung up by my wife to become preserved meat.\u201dWhen seeing the proud expression on the driver\u2019s face, Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but give a thumbs up and reveal his white teeth. \u201cMaster, you are incredible!\u201dAfter alighting at the marketplace, Lin Yuan could feel that it was significantly more crowded than normal.Each of the stalls was filled with all sorts of feys, but they had a variety of feys that wouldn\u2019t exceed five species. Furthermore, the species would be entirely different from the stall at the side. This was obviously an agreement between the stalls to prevent any malicious contest.The feys\u2019 prices would fluctuate, but not too much. Presently, the Normal Jasmine Lilies on the stall were being sold for 450 Federation dollars, and they were 50 Federation dollars more expensive than when Lin Yuan had bought them previously.A single pot of Usnea cost 200 Federation dollars, and a Normal Usnea would be sold for 1,600 Federation dollars. Elite Usneas were much more expensive than Elite Jasmine Lilies and had a price of 14,000 Federation dollars.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 14": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayProductive spirit plants like the Usneas were very rarely available in the market.Normal Usneas would occasionally be traded in the marketplace. However, basically no one would be willing to trade Elite Usneas in the marketplace.An Elite Usnea was equivalent to a foundation, and small stores could already cover their daily operating expenses just by selling the produced Usnea vines.A high-grade Usnea was expensive because it could produce over a dozen vines unlike the Jasmine Lilies that didn\u2019t have any byproducts. If some inferior energy ores could be buried in the Usnea pot, it would be able to constantly produce vines for an entire week.It was just like a hen that could lay eggs, making the price naturally higher.Among the different feys, there were astronomical differences in prices.In the fey marketplace, the highest price of a Normal Usnea would be around 1,600 Federation dollars. However, those Usneas that were well-developed and had thicker vines would have prices of around 3,000 Federation dollars. It was nearly double the price.At that moment, Lin Yuan suddenly realized that he had actually created a huge sum of wealth over a single night.He didn\u2019t just have Normal Usneas, but well-developed Elite Usneas, and he had over 20 pots of them. The amount of wealth had astonished Lin Yuan, but he quickly composed himself.Now that I have the ability to evolve feys, I will only be making more money in the future. This is just the beginning.While walking, Lin Yuan looked at the various feys in the stalls and attempted to circulate his spiritual power. Lin Yuan could distinctly feel the instinctive compatibility with each of the feys.Lin Yuan felt that he was more compatible with healing-type and support-type feys. Apart from that, he felt that he was especially intimate with plant-type feys.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t able to feel spirit qi previously and naturally didn\u2019t know which feys he was compatible with. Since he could circulate his spirit qi, Lin Yuan could find out his compatibility direction now that there were so many different types of feys gathered in the marketplace.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but recall Teacher Bao\u2019s words.Teacher Bao had praised Chu Ci\u2019s compatibility with defense-type feys and the fact that she was qualified to become a prodigy among the Hundred Sequence.Since my compatibility range is so extensive, I wonder how talented I am\u2026Immediately after, Lin Yuan thought about his pitiful amount of spiritual energy. Given this little speck of spiritual energy, it didn\u2019t matter how great his talent was. It was useless if he couldn\u2019t form contracts with feys.The types of feys that Lin Yuan was compatible with would determine that Lin Yuan would have to use Morbius\u2019 exclusive skill, Spirit Lock, on those types of feys.Morbius\u2019 Spirit Lock was only able to use the fey\u2019s initial ability, so Lin Yuan had to choose cautiously.The healing-type and support-type were much rarer than the power offense-type.Between the healing-type and support-type, the healing-type was much rarer. Therefore, Lin Yuan planned for his first Spirit Lock fey to be a healing-type with a strong healing ability.Currently, the most important matter wasn\u2019t for Lin Yuan to decide on a fey to use Spirit Lock on. He had to pick an outstanding, Elite defense-type fey for Chu Ci.As of now, Lin Yuan had only discovered two to three species of Elite defense-type feys. One of them was a Crust Rabbit that was considered fine.It had obtained the ability Strong Skin at elite-grade and allowed the contractor to produce a layer of horn-texture skin shield to help block damage. However, this Crust Rabbit didn\u2019t reach Lin Yuan\u2019s standards.It would be better if Lin Yuan had more time, as he could simply nurture a top-notch Elite fey for Chu Ci. However, there was only one day left. The Radiance Federation\u2019s schools had very strict rules. If the student didn\u2019t successfully contract a fey before live combat lessons, the student would fail the live combat subject. It would affect their chances of being enrolled into top universities in the future.This would certainly be detrimental to Chu Ci\u2019s life.At that moment, Lin Yuan noticed there was an iron cage by the foot of the stall owner ahead. There were three little goats with curved horns inside the cage. The goats might seem small, but those horns were massive and disproportionate with their bodies.Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes lit up as these were Coiled Horn Goats![Fey Name]: Coiled Horn Goat[Fey Species]: Goat species/Horned Goat subspecies[Fey Grade]: Elite (7/10)[Fey Type]: Rock[Fey Quality]: FlawlessAbilities:[Resist]: Using the large horns on the head to defend and resist attacks.[Horn Attack]: Using the large horns on the head to smash the target.Coiled Horn Goats were considered outstanding among Elite feys. In addition, these three Coiled Horn Goats were still kids and already had flawless-quality.Their ability to adapt would be much better than adult Coiled Horn Goats. Moreover, one of the Coiled Horn Goats had an elite-grade ability called the Jolt Horn. It was a rare control-type ability that Coiled Horn Goats could comprehend.The Coiled Horn Goat could use the Jolt Horn attack to paralyze the enemy by using high-frequency vibration.The Jolt Horn was a rather rare ability that only Elite Coiled Horn Goats would learn. Therefore, this Coiled Horn Goat with the Jolt Horn was superior to the two other Coiled Horn Goats that had the Horn Attack.Lin Yuan quickly walked in front of the stall and saw the owner leaning on the chair while reading the newspaper. Lin Yuan asked, \u201cBoss, what is the price of this Coiled Horn Goat?\u201dWhen Lin Yuan asked for the price, he was silently estimating the price in his heart. However, he didn\u2019t expect this middle-aged man to look up at Lin Yuan and shake his hand while chuckling. \u201cHandsome brother, my wife isn\u2019t around. I wouldn\u2019t know the price even if you asked.\u201dLin Yuan looked at the relaxed man and felt that he was being teased.Isn\u2019t this uncle tending to the stall? How could he not know the price of the fey?Upon seeing Lin Yuan\u2019s confused expression, the man rubbed his tummy and explained, \u201cThe doctor says I have a weak stomach and can only eat soft\u00a0rice1. That\u2019s why my wife decides everything that has to do with this stall. She went over to the opposite stall to buy some meat. I should be able to have some additional dishes tonight.\u201dThis fellow\u2019s shamelessness flabbergasted Lin Yuan. He actually stated that he could only eat soft rice, as though it was natural and righteous. He was obviously the king in the world of soft rice.When looking at the man\u2019s contented expression, Lin Yuan involuntarily thought that it was rather good to eat soft rice!But Lin Yuan immediately threw this thought out of his mind. For each step taken during the past decade, everything had been tough, so he would gladly accept the hardship.Lin Yuan extended his fist and shook it in front of the middle-aged man.In response, the man put the newspaper aside and assumed a defensive posture while shouting, \u201cThere are so many eye-witnesses here! Don\u2019t think about robbing me in broad daylight! If you want to rob, go over to that stall which sells tool-type feys. It will be easier for you to snatch!\u201dWhen the middle-aged man yelled out, Lin Yuan felt awkward. The stall owner by the side obviously heard that man and was infuriated. He immediately turned around and was enlightened after seeing the situation. He then said something as though he was in wretched luck, \u201cThat means ten. You have been flipping your newspaper acting as though you have some knowledge, but you don\u2019t even know this?\u201dThe middle-aged man noticed that Lin Yuan had been looking at the cage with the Coiled Horn Goats and immediately said, \u201cIt is impossible to sell the cage for 10 Federation dollars. It might be old, but I spent 50 Federation dollars to order it from the blacksmith back then!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 15": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis man\u2019s brain had such a huge hole that rendered Lin Yuan speechless. How big must the hole be in the brain for a person to think that someone else would want to buy the old cage? The hole must be huge enough to reach straight to the neck.\u201cUncle, I mean that I want to purchase one Coiled Horn Goat for 100,000.\u201d4Lin Yuan didn\u2019t show it on his face, but he had a small comment box that was violently cursing at this man with the weak stomach.Lin Yuan gave a very reasonable price. A regular Coiled Horn Goat could be purchased for the price of around 60,000 Federation dollars. As for that Coiled Horn Goat with the rare ability, its price would be around 95,000 Federation dollars. Lin Yuan was impatient, so he added another 5,000 Federation dollars to express his sincerity.When the man heard 100,000 Federation dollars, his eyes immediately lit up. He quickly picked up his phone to call his wife.After a short conversation, the man hung up the phone and also extended up a fist toward Lin Yuan before gesturing with a peace sign. \u201c120,000 Federation dollars.\u201dLin Yuan shook his head and turned away.Elite feys were commonly traded in the market, so they had their own fixed value. Although Lin Yuan had already expressed his sincerity in purchasing the Coiled Horn Goat with the Jolt Horn ability, it didn\u2019t mean that he could accept such an astronomical price.Since this fey marketplace has other feys similar to the Coiled Horn Goats, I shall just walk around first.Upon seeing Lin Yuan turn around, the middle-aged man got anxious and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you give me 105,00 Federation dollars? I will sell you this goat and also give you this cage!\u201dThe comment box in Lin Yuan\u2019s mind was barraged with more curses. If the back of Lin Yuan\u2019s head had eyes, he would certainly roll them at the man.Who the hell would want your old cage that hasn\u2019t been cleaned in months!?If it was during normal days, Lin Yuan would definitely walk away without saying anything. However, this involved finding a defense-type fey for his younger sister.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t act rashly and turned around to say to that man, \u201cI will look around first. If there isn\u2019t anything else suitable, I will purchase that Coiled Horn Goat that is at the innermost of the cage.\u201dThe middle-aged man wasn\u2019t happy when Lin Yuan didn\u2019t immediately purchase it. \u201cIf you come back to buy later, I will not be giving you the cage!\u201d he mumbled.The comment box in Lin Yuan\u2019s mind was now filled with curses as he turned and left.1Not far away, Lin Yuan noticed a very big stall ahead that was surrounded by plenty of people.These people were all standing beside the stall while holding baskets or bags in a queue. Lin Yuan could see that these people weren\u2019t here to purchase feys.After taking two more steps forward, Lin Yuan could smell the faint stench of blood in the air. He lifted the wing of his nose and discovered that the stench of blood was coming from the stall ahead.At that moment, Lin Yuan could see a stalwart man carrying a massive woven bag and walking forward strenuously. The bag was filled with spirit beast meat.The fey marketplace wouldn\u2019t normally slaughter feys to sell. Even when the federation citizens wanted to eat some fey meat, it would be from feys that were specially bred in slaughterhouses.2After seeing this scene, Lin Yuan could guess that this stall was set up by the breeding base that had been devastated by the dimensional rift.Just as Lin Yuan was about to head over to see if he could pick up any hidden wares, a boorish voice echoed from the stall.\u201cI thank everyone for providing your support during the past few days. All of the spirit beast meat has been sold. Allow me to apologize to those who didn\u2019t get to purchase any.\u201dThe boorish man\u2019s voice sounded exhausted and slightly sorrowful.Naturally, the crowd that had been queuing for a long time to purchase the spirit beast meat was unwilling to leave like this. They started shouting at the boorish man.\u201cBoss, I can still see a few severely injured spirit beasts inside. Why don\u2019t we just slaughter them?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Boss! Injured spirit beasts must be slaughtered! I didn\u2019t even spare the Bamboo Rats that we bred in my home when they got a heatstroke. I will bring one to the riverside to barbecue. They are truly mouth-watering!\u201d3Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but approve of this person.That is a rather great speech! I will give you a double like! But you don\u2019t have your distinctive style and should practice more.The boorish man quickly shook his hand. \u201cThose inside cannot be slaughtered. I apologize to everyone that waited in vain. If you are interested, you can go in and take a look to see if you fancy any of the spirit beasts. There are only three remaining spirit beasts inside. If you buy them, you will surely profit!\u201d2Seeing that there was no more meat to buy, the crowd scattered. Purchasing a severely injured fey might be getting value for money, but who was able to afford to hire a Creation Master to heal the fey?When the boorish man saw that most of the people had left, he crouched down to carefully wipe off the stains of blood left behind by the spirit beast meat that he had sold earlier.The boorish man habitually stated when he saw Lin Yuan walking up. \u201cAll the meat has been sold. This stall will not sell any more spirit beast meat.\u201dLin Yuan could see that the boorish man was exhausted. Apart from the unwavering determination in his eyes that was supporting his body, there was intense sadness.When the alien insects had invaded from the dimensional rift, it was said that only two individuals had managed to escape from the breeding base. Furthermore, one of two had died because of shock and wound infection, as no timely treatment had been provided.The boorish man was the only survivor from the fey breeding base.\u201cBoss, I am not here to purchase any meat. I wish to see what other feys you have to sell.\u201dWhen the boorish man heard the business knocking, he quickly stopped what he was doing and stood up. When he suddenly looked into Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes, the boorish man\u2019s heavy mood seemed to have significantly calmed down.This boorish man felt that this good-looking youth had a very amiable personality, making others feel unconsciously intimate. Even all the sad and exhausting emotions were suppressed because of this youth.4The boorish man stared at Lin Yuan, feeling that it was increasingly pleasant to look at him.These changes might be slightly related to Lin Yuan\u2019s looks and personality, but Morbius\u2019 awakening was the true reason.Morbius\u2019 passive ability, Calm Mind, had been activated. Calm Mind should only be effective toward Lin Yuan, but two nights ago, he had experimented with this ability. After that, he had realized that Calm Mind\u2019s effects would affect others within a certain distance from him. Nonetheless, it wouldn\u2019t be as intense.However, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know that the Calm Mind ability wouldn\u2019t just calm others\u2019 minds, but it would also subtly allow others to have a favorable opinion of him.1It was fortunate that Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know, or else he wouldn\u2019t be using it recklessly.\u201cYoung Brother, I am only a few years older than you. You can just call me Big Brother Yang. There are three severely injured feys inside. If you wish to see them, I will bring you in.\u201dWhen the boss called Lin Yuan, Young Brother, he was astonished.Why did he suddenly call me Young Brother!?After seeing a little white hair on the back of the boorish man\u2019s head, Lin Yuan started to suspect if he looked anxious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 16": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yuan had been operating a fey store since he was eight years old, so he was rather proficient in conversations. Seeing that the boorish man was so friendly to him, Lin Yuan got friendly too.\u201cBig Brother Yang, then can I trouble you to bring me inside for a look?\u201dThe boorish man used his hand to pat on Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder and laughed heartily. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so polite with your Big Brother.\u201dIn just a few seconds, we are already addressing each other as brothers. This script doesn\u2019t feel right,\u00a0Lin Yuan mumbled in his heart.2In fact, the Calm Mind ability would help Lin Yuan to receive favorable impressions. To be honest, a favorable impression was a sensory impression.The boorish man had such an attitude toward Lin Yuan because he was a forthright person. Also, when he was at his lowest emotional state, Lin Yuan\u2019s appearance had actually dismissed the sadness. It naturally made the boorish man feel that it was due to Lin Yuan.While the boorish man was leading at the front, Lin Yuan followed behind and looked around.The exterior of the stall had already been cleaned up. Apart from the three feys left inside the shed, there was basically nothing else. Had Lin Yuan not arrived today coincidentally, this stall might not be here tomorrow.After entering the shed, Yang Mingkai pointed at the two transparent boxes and said, \u201cInside those boxes are two Web-Spraying Spiders. They might look healthy now, but their abdomens have been torn open. From the looks of it, they will only last for another two days.\u201dYang Mingkai wasn\u2019t a dishonest merchant, but he probably wouldn\u2019t get into detail about the Web-Spraying Spiders\u2019 injuries if it were someone else.This was all due to the favorable impression that Yang Mingkai had on Lin Yuan.Lin Yuan was using True Data to check on the two Web-Spraying Spiders\u2019 information.[Fey Name]: Web-Spraying Spider[Fey Species]: Arachnid species/Web-Weaving Spider subspecies[Fey Grade]: Elite (10/10)1[Fey Type]: Poison[Fey Quality]: FlawlessAbilities:[Thread Conceal]: During the moving process, the movement trajectory will be sprayed out with sharp spider threads that are hard to detect.[Poison Web]: Spray out a web of threads in front that is poisonous.These two Web-Spraying Spiders were averaging at Elite X/Flawless.An Elite X/Flawless fey was only one step away from reaching bronze-grade. Had it not been for the dimensional rift, these two Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders would have successfully reached bronze-grade and awakened their exclusive skills.This was something great that wouldn\u2019t be seen during normal days in the fey marketplace.Feys that were one breath away from bronze-grade would normally be sold on the Star Web.When Yang Mingkai saw how serious Lin Yuan was when looking at the Web-Spraying Spiders, his face turned sad again as he thought of something.\u201cDuring the alien insects\u2019 invasion, the Web-Spraying Spiders were able to survive because they are insect feys and small enough to hide inside a bigger fey\u2019s body. However, before they hid inside the body of the bigger fey, their abdomens were still stabbed by the alien insects.\u201dYang Mingkai\u2019s face revealed his sadness again, but Lin Yuan didn\u2019t use Morbius\u2019 Calm Mind this time. Some experiences could never be forgotten. It was like an obstacle on the road, and if one couldn\u2019t surpass it, they would be trapped forever and die in this state.After getting over this obstacle, it would make the person tougher, and their hearts would be stronger. This was Yang Mingkai\u2019s obstacle, and no one would help, as he had to get over it by himself.\u201cBig Brother Yang, sometimes, it is useless to continue feeling sad. Why don\u2019t you put it in the past and look forward to the future?\u201dBefore Yang Mingkai could reply, Lin Yuan said again, \u201cIf these two Web-Spraying Spiders weren\u2019t injured, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem for them to be sold for 300,000 Federation dollars on the Star Web.\u201dThe prices for support-type feys of the spider species were always very high. The Web-Spraying Spider\u2019s abilities had great control power and were slightly poisonous. It was considered a support-type fey with strong lethal power.It was able to achieve a supportive effect that was brutal and direct when controlling the enemy.The size of the Web-Spraying Spider was small, only around ten centimeters. It was very nimble and great at concealment, making it an outstanding fey for wilderness battles.Yang Mingkai felt that Lin Yuan\u2019s words had penetrated right into his heart. He was alone now, and after experiencing the disaster, it felt as though no one else had talked to him like this apart from the rescuers.While living in the harsh cold environment, a little warmth could warm the body, and a little light from a matchstick was enough to illuminate the dark house.\u201c300,000 Federation dollars is still too little. The prices on the Star Web when selling feys are normally higher, and it is due to the restrictions of talent. To people who need them, they wouldn\u2019t mind spending more money. However, these two Web-Spraying Spiders are already injured. It would already be good enough to sell both of them for 150,000 Federation dollars together.\u201dLin Yuan nodded. Given how Yang Mingkai set the prices, he knew that he was an honest person.Apart from being able to form a contract with the Web-Spraying Spiders, they were also a medicinal ingredient. The carcass of a Web-Spraying Spider was worth about 50,000 Federation dollars. Therefore, when setting the price of these severely injured Web-Spraying Spiders at 75,000 Federation dollars each, it was already very reasonable.\u201cBig Brother Yang, I wish to buy these Web-Spraying Spiders, but I do not have enough money on me. I wonder if I can trade for them with feys?\u201dLin Yuan had come to the marketplace today with the plan to use the Elite Usneas in exchange for money. The Elite Usneas were productive spirits plants that were always in demand. Thus, Lin Yuan was very certain.Yang Mingkai frowned after hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s words. If it were someone else saying this, Yang Mingkai would have already chased them out.It was common to use feys in exchange for money. However, there was a condition that the other party required the feys, or if it was a top-selling fey that was hard to find in the market.\u201cYoung Brother, I don\u2019t wish to conceal anything from you. After I finish handling this batch of feys, I plan to open up another fey breeding base and restart everything. That\u2019s why, if you use feys to trade with me, I might not need them.\u201dYang Mingkai might have a good impression of Lin Yuan, but business was still business.When Lin Yuan heard that Yang Mingkai would be opening a breeding base, he immediately smiled. \u201cBig Brother Yang, I have some Elite Usneas. Do you think I can use them for trading?\u201dAs soon as Lin Yuan spoke, Yang Mingkai asked with a pleasantly surprised tone, \u201cYoung Brother, do you want to trade with Elite Usneas? I wonder what the quality of your Elite Usneas is?\u201dYang Mingkai was planning to build a fey breeding base and start small. It was the same as destroying everything and restarting.Everything would be difficult at the start, and Yang Mingkai had been fretting about the initial feys that were required for the setup.Elite Usneas had to be nurtured through special methods, and they were able to produce plenty of regular Usneas. An Elite Usnea was already qualified to produce new seeds. However, it was almost impossible for anyone to sell Elite Usneas.Yang Mingkai had been collecting information to purchase Elite Usneas during the past few days, but he couldn\u2019t find anything.A few parties were willing to sell, but their asking prices were at least twice as much as the market rate. If Yang Mingkai were to buy them, it would lead to a huge deficit at the beginning.Now that Lin Yuan wanted to trade Elite Usneas, Yang Mingkai was immediately excited.\u201cQualitywise, they are all rather good. If Big Brother Yang agrees to trade for Elite Usneas, you can come over to my place and take a look at the goods first.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan saw Yang Mingkai\u2019s excited reaction, he knew it was going to work. Just as Lin Yuan and Yang Mingkai were speaking, Lin Yuan suddenly heard a rather weak \u2018Moo~\u2019.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one expected for the Sharp Rock Bull\u2019s horn to break during the disaster. The value of this Sharp Rock Bull isn\u2019t because of its Epic quality but its elite-grade skill. This Sharp Rock Bull comprehended a rare ability that is exclusive to the Sharp Rock Bulls, Sacrifice. Our breeding base has nurtured over 1,500 Sharp Rock Bulls during the past years, but only this Sharp Rock Bull comprehended Sacrifice.\u201dLin Yuan had also noticed the ability, Sacrifice, which could halve the damage for the contractor. He really liked the ability.If his younger sister contracted a fey that possessed Sacrifice, it would definitely be able to protect her better, making it the best meat shield.However, Lin Yuan had a feeling that this Sharp Rock Bull didn\u2019t look too smart. Rock Horn was considered a suicidal charging attack that disregarded injuries. Sacrifice was an ability that helped to endure damage. This Sharp Rock Bull was simply a brave bull that was not afraid of bleeding and death. It was a top-class iron fool, not just a normal fool.2\u201cI wonder how much you are willing to sell this Sharp Rock Bull for?\u201dIf this Sharp Rock Bull was healthy, even Lin Yuan\u2019s current pots of Elite Usneas wouldn\u2019t be able to purchase 1/3 of the Sharp Rock Bull. After all, this Sharp Rock Bull was a masterpiece.Yang Mingkai looked at the Sharp Rock Bull\u2019s broken horn and thought for a long time before speaking. \u201cWhen this Sharp Rock Bull was healthy, I was preparing to sell it for 1.5 Radiance dollars. But if Young Brother wants it, I can sell it to you for 200,000 Federation dollars.\u201cYoung Brother, I have to say something first. It isn\u2019t just this Sharp Rock Bull, the two Web-Spraying Spiders are also in the same condition. I have looked for a Healer to check on them and discovered that the three feys have injured their roots. Regular Healers won\u2019t be able to do anything. Only Creation Masters are able to heal them.\u201dLin Yuan wasn\u2019t concerned about this point.Before this, Lin Yuan had experimented with his spirit qi\u2019s ability to evolve feys, using a pot of Jasmine Lily as a test subject.Lin Yuan had cut off half of the Jasmine Lily\u2019s stalk. If it were left alone, the Jasmine Lily would definitely wither unless a Creation Master helped to nurture it with full attention.2However, after Lin Yuan had channeled his spirit qi into the Jasmine Lily, its injury had recovered automatically.Therefore, Lin Yuan was certain that his method to evolve feys with spirit qi was able to heal feys that had injured their roots.There was a point that Lin Yuan didn\u2019t guess wrongly, and it was the price of the Sharp Rock Bull, which was astronomical.The Federation dollar was the Radiance Federation\u2019s lowest class of currency, and it was mainly produced for most of the ordinary people who couldn\u2019t sense spirit qi.The Radiance dollar was the Radiance Federation\u2019s high-class currency, as high-grade feys were invaluable. The prices during transactions would easily reach tens of millions in Federation dollars, so the Radiance Federation had created the Radiance dollar.A single Radiance dollar would be equivalent to 1,000,000 Federation dollars, and it was mainly used between spirit qi professionals.If this Sharp Rock Bull was healthy, it would be sold for 1.5 Radiance dollars, which was 1,500,000 Federation dollars. It was a price that Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t afford right now.However, the severely injured Sharp Rock Bull cost 200,000 Federation dollars, and Lin Yuan was able to afford it.\u201cBig Brother Yang, I know, but I still wish to trade. Why don\u2019t you come to my place and take a look at the quality of my Elite Usneas before we talk about the trade?\u201dLin Yuan had already made the decision to buy both the Web-Spraying Spiders and the Sharp Rock Bull, so he couldn\u2019t wait to complete the trade.Lin Yuan would still need to heal the Sharp Rock Bull\u2019s injuries after the trade. If he were too late, he wouldn\u2019t have enough time to catch the last train that headed for Chu Ci\u2019s school today.Lin Yuan had already spent three hours away from his home. He might be able to sense spirit qi, but his body had yet to completely recover.He felt that his head was getting increasingly dizzy as he had not slept for an entire night and had been searching for feys on the marketplace for over two hours.When Yang Mingkai heard Lin Yuan extending the invitation to visit his house for the second time to check on the Elite Usneas\u2019 quality, Yang Mingkai immediately agreed.Lin Yuan might have promised that the Elite Usneas were well-developed, but Yang Mingkai had to check on the quality before he could relax.Yang Mingkai wanted to use the Elite Usneas and clone them to produce Usnea saplings. Therefore, the quality of the Elite Usneas must be great and of a strict standard.Yang Mingkai already planned ahead in his mind. After he saw Lin Yuan\u2019s Elite Usneas and realized they were not up to his standard, he would negotiate for the price based on the Star Web\u2019s price.If these Elite Usneas didn\u2019t reach the standard to conduct cloning, Yang Mingkai could only resell them, and it would be a waste of time and effort.However, due to his good impression of Lin Yuan, Yang Mingkai had already decided to carry out this deal.2\u201cYoung Brother, wait for a moment. I will pack up this stall and leave with you. Since you are taking all three of those severely injured feys, there is no need for this stall to continue existing.\u201dLin Yuan felt great after hearing Yang Mingkai\u2019s words as it was a feeling of being trusted. Yang Mingkai had yet to see his Elite Usneas, and the two Web-Spraying Spiders and the Sharp Rock Bull would only last for a few more days too.Packing up the stall is definitely a sign that Yang Mingkai trusts me. Even though Yang Mingkai hasn\u2019t seen the Elite Usneas\u2019 quality, he has already decided to make a deal with me. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t pack up the stall as the three severely injured feys wouldn\u2019t be able to endure harsh conditions outside of the shed.\u201cBig Brother Yang, let me help you.\u201dLin Yuan then picked up the housekeeping tools at the stall and started to clean up the stall\u2019s miscellaneous items. Yang Mingkai didn\u2019t stop Lin Yuan and was speaking as he tore down the shed.\u201cI just happen to have some Ostrich Logistics\u2019 custom boxes to store feys. Later on, we can use them to store the Sharp Rock Bull and the Web-Spraying Spiders. It will save us a lot of trouble.\u201d4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 18": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOstrich Logistics was a massive organization in the Radiance Federation, and it covered nearly half of the federation\u2019s logistics needs.Ostrich Logistics\u2019 main business was to transport all sorts of feys, and the Spirit Storage Box was their patented invention. It was a device for convenient transportation of feys, created with advanced technology.When the fey was contained in the spirit storage box, its size wouldn\u2019t shrink. However, the spirit storage box\u2019s gravity technology could negate the fey\u2019s weight, allowing heavy feys to be transported easily.4The spirit storage box had grades that were sorted according to the feys\u2019 grades. Regular-sized spirit storage boxes could be bought from Ostrich Logistics\u2019 stores.If anyone needed to transport massive feys, they would need to put a custom order on Ostrich Logistics\u2019 Star Web store.Although the spirit storage box was commonly used, it was still expensive.A spirit storage box used to store Elite feys would cost 1,000 Federation dollars, and this price was already equivalent to some of the cheaper Elite feys. If the spirit storage box was used to transport ordinary Elite feys, it would waste its value. Therefore, Elite feys that were transported with spirit storage boxes were generally the expensive kind.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect Yang Mingkai to have prepared spirit storage boxes for the severely injured feys.\u201cBig Brother Yang, then it will be much more convenient for us to transport the feys. We won\u2019t need to look for specialized transporters to help. It will save us plenty of time.\u201dElite feys, such as the Sharp Rock Bull and the Web-Spraying Spiders, had a certain lethality level, especially when they were injured. Yang Mingkai\u2019s spirit storage boxes really saved them a lot of trouble.\u201cThese spirit storage boxes were left behind in the previous breeding base. Many of them were already broken and faulty. After disposing of the rest of the boxes yesterday, I kept three. Two elite-grade spirit storage boxes to contain the Web-Spraying Spiders and one bronze-grade spirit storage box to contain the Sharp Rock Bull.\u201cSigh! This Sharp Rock Bull will probably never reach bronze-grade. It\u2019s a waste of its Epic quality and the Sacrifice ability.\u201dYang Mingkai was very efficient and quickly torn down the shed. Lin Yuan originally wanted to order a Thick-Hoofed Donkey Car, but Yang Mingkai patted on Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder before he activated his spiritual energy.A three-meter long lizard with black and red scales appeared behind Yang Mingkai. When the lizard was released, it immediately hissed and roared. Lin Yuan felt as though the surrounding air had turned scorching hot.The lizard had a wrinkled crown, and the scales on the crown looked extremely bright red. It made Lin Yuan feel as though the heat was actually emitted from the bright red crown.Beneath the crown were more mixtures of black color, and when reaching its limbs and abdomen, it was nearly black in color.Lin Yuan used True Data to check on the massive black and red lizard.[Fey Name]: Crowned Fire Salamander[Fey Species]: Crowned Lizard species/Scaled Lizard species[Fey Grade]: Bronze (7/10)[Fey Type]: Poison/Fire[Fey Quality]: NormalAbilities:[Broken Teeth]: When biting and ripping, it will intentionally break its teeth and embed them in the target.3[Rolling Rip]: When biting onto the target, it will use the mouth as the core area and revolve the body to rip off the target\u2019s bones and flesh.Exclusive Skill:[Fiery Poison]: Grow the poison gland and connect it with the salivary gland, allowing the saliva to contain fiery poison.An Elite fey\u2019s quality didn\u2019t play a major role before reaching bronze-grade. Once it reached Bronze, its quality would revert to Normal again. Afterward, it wouldn\u2019t matter what the grade of the fey was. It could only evolve into a Fantasy Breed when the quality broke through Epic and reached Legend.A Bronze fey would awaken an exclusive skill, but it wouldn\u2019t have an additional ability.1Due to the awakened exclusive skill, all of the abilities would be subtly enhanced. It was a qualitative change.This black and red lizard was a high-level Bronze Crowned Fire Salamander. It might be called a salamander, but this Crowned Fire Salamander didn\u2019t know how to use the fire-type element energy.It was due to the evolution direction during bronze-grade that enhanced the physical body. Hence, it was returning to the ancestry line.The Crowned Fire Salamander\u2019s bright red crown had a lump that contained an abnormally well-developed poison gland.The poison gland wasn\u2019t connected to the Crowned Fire Salamander\u2019s teeth, but the salivary gland. When the Crowned Fire Salamander used its teeth to bite and rip the enemy, the poison fluid from the crown would be injected into the enemy\u2019s body along with the biting action.In a very short period, the bitten location would develop a charred wound as though it was burned.This was how the Crowned Fire Salamander had gotten its name.Lin Yuan had encountered Bronze feys previously. Registered spirit qi professionals of the Radiance Federation were able to ride their feys to travel in the city, and Lin Yuan would occasionally see them when importing goods.However, this was the first time he was observing a three-meter-long Bronze Crowned Fire Salamander at such a close distance.Lin Yuan felt an indescribable impact in his heart.Everyone said that the gap between Elite and Bronze was a huge chasm, and to get across it was to rise to a higher level. From the looks of it now, it was indeed true. The prowess of a Bronze fey was utterly superior to an Elite fey.\u201cYoung Brother, my Crowned Fire Salamander is nurtured to a rather good condition, right?\u201d When Yang Mingkai was speaking, he didn\u2019t forget to pat on the Crowned Fire Salamander\u2019s neck, as he was obviously satisfied with his fey partner.The Crowned Fire Salamander was aggressive in nature and sinister in appearance, especially the layers of wrinkles on the bright red crown, making it abnormally strange. However, after seeing its owner interacting with it, the Crowned Fire Salamander looked pleased and used its head to rub against Yang Mingkai\u2019s shoulder.No matter the situation, the relationship of a spirit qi professional and the contracted fey was that of best friends.Lin Yuan would be very envious if he saw this scene in the past, but he wasn\u2019t envious now. He subtly touched the copper bracelet on his right wrist and felt warmth in his heart. Lin Yuan also had his own contracted fey now.Morbius, Genius, and Chimey were Lin Yuan\u2019s contracted feys. He was no longer an ordinary person who couldn\u2019t contract feys and sense spirit qi.\u201cBig Brother Yang, your Crowned Fire Salamander\u2019s awakened exclusive skill, Fiery Poison, is rather good. It effectively enhances the Crowned Fire Salamander\u2019s attack method.\u201d Lin Yuan praised.2Lin Yuan\u2019s statement surprised Yang Mingkai. \u201cYoung Brother, how did you know that my Crowned Fire Salamander awakened the Fiery Poison skill?\u201dYang Mingkai didn\u2019t recall mentioning his spirit beast\u2019s skill to Lin Yuan.Lin Yuan pointed at the Crowned Fire Salamander\u2019s bright red crown and said, \u201cAn average Crowned Fire Salamander\u2019s crown wouldn\u2019t be so bright and massive. Only Crowned Fire Salamanders that awakened the Fierce Fire or Fiery Poison skills would have such a crown. In addition, when Big Brother Yang interacts with your Crowned Fire Salamander, you avoid its mouth. That is how I deduced that its awakened skill is Fiery Poison.\u201d4After Lin Yuan\u2019s explanation, Yang Mingkai immediately understood and exclaimed, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Young Brother to possess such professional knowledge at such a young age that only Fey Observers have!\u201dYang Mingkai was thinking in his heart that Lin Yuan was truly incredible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As such, they could deduce lots of information concerning feys.Lifestyle occupations, like the knowledgeable Fey Observers, were always respected.Lin Yuan, who could immediately identify a Bronze fey\u2019s exclusive skill, left a deep impression in Yang Mingkai. In his eyes, this feat made Lin Yuan an incredible figure.Lin Yuan shook his hand and said, \u201cBig Brother Yang, we better go now. Otherwise, the Crowned Fire Salamander that you summoned will continue to affect the surrounding low-grade feys.\u201dYang Mingkai looked around along with Lin Yuan and realized that the stall owner beside him was already looking at him with unpleasant eyes.Yang Mingkai let out an embarrassed smile and quickly asked Lin Yuan to ride on the back of the Crowned Fire Salamander. As for the three spirit storage boxes that contained the Web-Spraying Spiders and the Sharp Rock Bull, the Crowned Fire Salamander\u2019s tail pulled them in tow.After Lin Yuan pointed out the direction, Yang Mingkai urged the Crowned Fire Salamander, which responded by galloping rapidly.When Lin Yuan had been riding the Thick-Hoofed Donkey earlier, he could only feel a refreshing breeze. Unsurprisingly, the running Crowned Fire Salamander was ultrafast, far beyond what the Thick-Hoofed Donkey could do.2The billowing and howling gales blew against Lin Yuan\u2019s body and gave him a pressuring feeling. After all, Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t a D-rank spirit qi professional yet.Had it not been for Yang Mingkai intentionally blocking the gales for Lin Yuan, the latter would have fallen off the back of the Crowned Fire Salamander.The journey\u2019s strong gales didn\u2019t just disperse Lin Yuan\u2019s mental exhaustion, but they also stirred up Lin Yuan\u2019s heart.Galloping in the wind and riding on feys was a life that a man should live!After reaching the alley where Lin Yuan resided, Yang Mingkai withdrew the Crowned Fire Salamander. It wasn\u2019t that the alley didn\u2019t allow riding feys\u2026 It was too narrow. It was impossible for the Crowned Fire Salamander, whose legs pushed outward, to move in it.Lin Yuan jumped off the Crowned Fire Salamander\u2019s back, and the wind disheveled his hair. This added to Lin Yuan\u2019s handsome looks a wild nature too.Yang Mingkai said, \u201cThe Crowned Fire Salamander generates rather intense air currents when it\u2019s running. Are you okay?\u201dLin Yuan shook his head and replied, \u201cI have to thank Big Brother Yang. This is my first time riding on the back of a Bronze fey. It was truly satisfying!\u201dYang Mingkai laughed heartily and said, \u201cRiding on the Crowned Fire Salamander isn\u2019t considered satisfying. When you take a ride on a flying fey and smell the thin air in the high altitudes, while looking down at the ground, that is satisfying!\u201d7Lin Yuan led the way, and they arrived at the store entrance swiftly. When he opened the door, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t hear Chimey or Genius calling out. He could guess that those two fellows were still sleeping.Fortunately, Lin Yuan had not forgotten to close the second floor\u2019s door before leaving, or else he might have woken up Genius and Chimey when opening the store\u2019s door.Yang Mingkai entered the store, and Lin Yuan poured two cups of water.\u201cBig Brother Yang, I don\u2019t have any beverages here. I can only offer you water, and this is for you.\u201dAfter giving the cup of water to Yang Mingkai, Lin Yuan gulped down his cup\u2019s content.Although Yang Mingkai received the water cup, he didn\u2019t take a sip. It wasn\u2019t that Yang Mingkai wasn\u2019t thirsty\u2026 He was simply flabbergasted by the rows of Elite Usneas on the racks of this small store.The rows of Usneas were all pleasantly long, had firm vines, and the leaves were all very crowded together. Water beads also suspended on the large leaves.Just the Elite Usneas\u2019 appearance betrayed their Normal and Elite quality. It had to be known that Usneas were Elite in terms of grade and quality met the criteria for cloning.This was already beyond Yang Mingkai\u2019s expectations. The 20+ pots of Elite/Elite Usneas was a shocking spectacle, and one would hardly trade them.Compared to these Elite Usneas, the three pots of Elite Jasmine Lilies looked average.When Lin Yuan saw how Yang Mingkai was staring at the Usneas, as though he wanted to approach and scrutinize them, Lin Yuan immediately offered. \u201cBig Brother Yang, why don\u2019t you get closer to check them carefully? Before these pots of Usneas evolved, they had great foundations. I always bury energy ores in the soil, so their roots are very well-developed.\u201dYang Mingkai went closer to the rack along with Lin Yuan and touched the Usneas\u2019 leaves. He realized that the leaves had a thick and fleshy texture, indicating that the ample water content in them.Yang Mingkai plucked off one of the leaves, and when he broke the leaf\u2019s stem, plenty of sap flowed out. At the same time, he observed the roots, which from just their appearance alone looked strong.Soon, he recalled what Lin Yuan had said earlier and was convinced. These Elite Usneas were superior among the Elite Usneas.After checking the 20+ pots of Elite Usneas, their grade no longer surprised Yang Mingkai. He was now wondering about their astonishing origins instead.These Elite Usneas are well-nurtured, and their conditions are unbelievable. It looks as though a Creation Master tended to them recently\u2026Naturally, Yang Mingkai didn\u2019t think that Lin Yuan was a Creation Master, as Creation Masters were the Radiance Federation\u2019s most respectable occupation.Even the lowest-ranked Creation Master could open a spacious store in Redbud City\u2019s core area. Countless combat-class spirit qi professionals would think of methods to build a good relationship with Creation Masters.If Lin Yuan was really a Creation Master, he wouldn\u2019t be cowering in this little store. Therefore, it meant that a Creation Master was backing this store.5Yang Mingkai had been working hard to operate the fey breeding base for many years but hadn\u2019t been able to form a relationship with any Creation Master. Otherwise, the epic-quality Sharp Rock Bull would have long reached bronze-grade.It wasn\u2019t like he hadn\u2019t thought of methods to seek a Creation Master\u2019s help. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have the bargaining chips to invite a Creation Master.Even if one had Federation and Radiance dollars, it was still insufficient to invite a Creation Master to enter their door. In order to invite a Creation Master, one would need to possess the Creation Master\u2019s most preferred spiritual ingredient and use it as a bargaining chip to set the appointment.Spiritual ingredients were hard to find, and Yang Mingkai was unable to obtain any. When Yang Mingkai thought that Lin Yuan had the backing of a Creation Master, he involuntarily wanted to try building a relationship with the Creation Master through Lin Yuan.However, Yang Mingkai didn\u2019t know how to make such a suggestion.When Lin Yuan noticed that Yang Mingkai was observing the Usneas for a long time without speaking, he asked, \u201cBig Brother Yang, are you satisfied with these Usneas?\u201dYang Mingkai immediately returned to his senses and responded after hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s voice, \u201cSatisfied, very satisfied. These Elite Usneas are far beyond my expectations. I wonder if Brother Lin has more of these Elite Usneas?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYang Mingkai had suddenly become reserved and even changed the way he addressed Lin Yuan, so the latter involuntarily said, \u201cBig Brother Yang, you are my senior, just call me Young Brother.\u201dWhile listening to Lin Yuan, Yang Mingkai observed his frank expression. Yang Mingkai was a forthright and straightforward person, so he patted on Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cHaha, I also feel comfortable calling you Young Brother.\u201dLin Yuan chuckled. \u201cBig Brother Yang, you said you wanted more Elite Usneas. I do have them, but I wonder how many more pots you need.\u201dLin Yuan had already planned to stay at home to increase his spirit qi occupation rank to D-rank after delivering the fey to Chu Ci. Therefore, he was definitely going to evolve plenty of feys.2It was about time to produce more Elite Usneas.Yang Mingkai carefully extended one finger. \u201cOver 70 pots, adding to a total of 100 pots. Does Young Brother think it is possible?\u201dBefore Lin Yuan could talk, Yang Mingkai quickly supplemented another statement. \u201cYoung Brother, your Elite Usneas are of Elite quality. If you sell them on the Star Web, you can get around 30,000 Federation dollars per pot. I cannot allow Young Brother to suffer a loss, so I\u2019ll add 3,000 Federation dollars for each pot. Do you think 33,000 Federation dollars for each pot is acceptable?\u201dYang Mingkai immediately offered the highest price in his mind. In fact, the price was a little lower than the high transaction prices on the Star Web. However, Yang Mingkai offered a reasonable price, which was the average price for Elite/Elite Usneas.Yang Mingkai was going to open another fey breeding base, and that would require considerable expenditure.33,000 Federation dollars for each of the 100 pots was already the highest price that Yang Mingkai could offer.Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and felt that the offer was reasonable. If he had to sell them on the Star Web, he would need to waste a lot of effort. Also, instead of wasting his time, he would be able to evolve more pots of Usneas.\u201cBig Brother Yang, your price is acceptable. However, if you need 100 pots of Usneas, you might have to give me seven days before you can collect them.\u201d4Lin Yuan would need two days to visit Chu Ci\u2019s school and return. He required slightly more than an hour to evolve each pot of Usnea. After deducting the 20+ pots of Usneas that were already available, Lin Yuan would need around 70+ hours to evolve the rest.Thus, Lin Yuan could only have them around seven days at the earliest.\u201cSeven days?\u201dYang Mingkai was even more confident that a Creation Master was backing Lin Yuan. In addition, Lin Yuan seemed to have an extremely close relationship with the Creation Master. Otherwise, it was impossible to deliver such a huge order.Seven days was simply too fast. Under normal circumstances, other suppliers would find it impossible to deliver even if they were given two months.It was definitely a divine method!Lin Yuan nodded as seven days was already his limit. Lin Yuan thought that Yang Mingkai felt it was rather slow, but Yang Mingkai actually felt it was too fast.At that moment, the second floor\u2019s door was gently opened before it was carefully closed again. A small figure rushed down the stairs quickly and pounced into Lin Yuan\u2019s embrace.After a \u201cmeow\u201d, it held Lin Yuan\u2019s hand and said, \u201cYuan, Chimey is still sleeping. Chimey is a lazy bum. Genius is already awake, Genius is diligent.\u201dLin Yuan reached out to gently scratch Genius\u2019 nose. Genius let out a sneeze with a \u2018meoow\u2019 before sitting obediently in Lin Yuan\u2019s embrace while feeling content.When Genius had come to this home, it had been rather afraid of strangers. But now, Genius was already used to it.Housekeeping beasts were feys that each federation citizen possessed, and Yang Mingkai wasn\u2019t an exception either. However, Yang Mingkai\u2019s housekeeping beast had perished during the alien insects\u2019 invasion.\u201cYoung Brother, your housekeeping beast is brilliant. This is the first time I see such a beautiful housekeeping beast.\u201dWhen Genius heard Yang Mingkai\u2019s comment, it took a glance at Yang Mingkai before burying its head into Lin Yuan\u2019s chest fondly.\u201cI feel that Genius is also the most incredible and cutest Hundred Questions Beast!\u201d While speaking, Lin Yuan rubbed Genius\u2019 silverish grey fur, which was a form of approval and acknowledgment.When Genius had been brought there, it had just been a small abandoned fellow with a messy fur that no one wanted. Despite that, Genius broke the norm for Hundred Questions Beasts and became the first Normal Hundred Questions Beasts in history.Moreover, this was just the starting point and not the ending point. As Genius\u2019 contractor and partner, whenever someone praised Genius, Lin Yuan felt proud of Genius.Subsequently, Lin Yuan and Yang Mingkai conducted the trade, a total of 23 pots of Elite/Elite Usneas for 759,000 Federation dollars.2After deducting the 350,000 Federation dollars for the Elite Web-Spraying Spiders and Sharp Rock Bull, Yang Mingkai used the Star Web account to transfer 409,000 Federation dollars to Lin Yuan.Yang Mingkai originally wanted to transfer the deposit for the remaining 77 pots of Usneas to Lin Yuan, which was 10% of the cost, but Lin Yuan rejected the idea.Lin Yuan stated that the money for the remaining Usneas would be settled together when Yang Mingkai returned to collect the goods.After adding the 20,000 Federation dollars that Lin Yuan already had in his Star Web account, he now had 429,000 Federation dollars. This was an amount of wealth that Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t dare to imagine that he would possess.Lin Yuan helped Yang Mingkai shift the Usneas from the rack onto the back of the Crowned Fire Salamander, waiting in the alley. After sending off Yang Mingkai, Lin Yuan immediately returned to the store.Lin Yuan had a very tight schedule, and he had to heal this Elite/Epic Sharp Rock Bull. After healing the Sharp Rock Bull, he would need to rush to Chu Ci\u2019s school.3Lin Yuan had money now and would only be earning more money in the future. Money would no longer be a problem for their family. Hence, Lin Yuan was planning to rent a Bronze avian fey. This way, he would be able to cut down the seven-hour journey into a one-hour trip.Lin Yuan approached Ostrich Logistics\u2019 spirit storage box and released the severely injured Sharp Rock Bull that was lying in it. When the Sharp Rock Bull was released, it immediately occupied most of Lin Yuan\u2019s store space.This Sharp Rock Bull was only a calf, and its size wasn\u2019t even two meters, which meant that it was about two years old.An adult Sharp Rock Bull\u2019s size would be at least 2,5 meters in length.However, this Sharp Rock Bull had two shattered horns, and its body had tiny wounds that would shock anyone.Lin Yuan was looking at the Sharp Rock Bull while it was also looking at him. The Sharp Rock Bull was apparently a little nervous and was waving its head while feeling uneasy.Lin Yuan carefully placed his hand on the Sharp Rock Bull\u2019s broken horn and slowly transferred his spirit qi to the Sharp Rock Bull.When the Sharp Rock Bull felt the spirit qi, it slowly let down its guard. An Elite fey was rather spiritual and could feel Lin Yuan\u2019s friendly intent, so it lay there obediently.While Lin Yuan was rapidly absorbing spirit qi, he was also rapidly injecting it into the Sharp Rock Bull.Ten minutes later, the tiny wounds on the Sharp Rock Bull had gradually recovered due to Lin Yuan\u2019s channeled spirit qi.After an hour or so, the Sharp Rock Bull continued to lay there in a weak state. All of a sudden, it let out an extremely painful \u2018mooing\u2019 sound.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 21": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Sharp Rock Bull was trembling as it endured, but even it couldn\u2019t withstand such immense pain.Lin Yuan felt a considerable pushing force against the hand that was touching the broken horn. Lin Yuan swayed a little, and the pair of horns on the Sharp Rock Bull fell off. Immediately after, a new pair of horns grew out on its head.Lin Yuan placed his hand back on the little horns before channeling his spirit qi at full force.When the sky was starting to turn dark, the Sharp Rock Bull\u2019s horns recovered, and they only stopped growing when they reached over one foot in length.It took nearly seven hours, but Lin Yuan finally healed the severely injured Sharp Rock Bull. Suppose the severely injured Sharp Rock Bull was worth 200,000 Federation dollars. In that case, the current healthy Elite/Epic Sharp Rock Bull could be easily sold on the Star Web for 1,5 Radiance dollars, or 1,500,000 Federation dollars.This was also why Creation Masters were so respected.Lin Yuan was still channeling spirit qi into the Sharp Rock Bull as he could feel an obstacle in the dark. As long as he continued channeling his spirit qi, he would be able to smash the obstacle. This Sharp Rock Bull would then undergo a qualitative change.Lin Yuan was ecstatic as this should be the obstacle blocking Elite feys from becoming Bronze ones.Lin Yuan increased his spirit qi\u2019s release speed to smash the obstacle with full strength. Finally, half an hour later, the obstacle was pulverized to dust.At that moment, Lin Yuan saw the Sharp Rock Bull, which was originally lying down, suddenly stand upright. Its body was emitting creaking and cracking sounds as its bones were shifting. In less than two minutes, the Sharp Rock Bull\u2019s appearance changed drastically.1Had it not been for Lin Yuan witnessing it, he probably wouldn\u2019t recognize the fey in front of him as the Sharp Rock Bull of just a few moments ago.Lin Yuan activated True Data to check on the Sharp Rock Bull\u2019s situation. No, it shouldn\u2019t be called a Sharp Rock Bull anymore. It should be called Sharp Iron Horn Bull.4The Sharp Rock Bull, which was originally two meters in length, had already transformed into a Sharp Iron Horn Bull that was nearly three meters in length. The Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s greatest change wasn\u2019t in its size, but the horns on its head.3The Sharp Rock Bull actually had a small horn on its nose, but it was only 2,5cm in size. Therefore, it had been useless.However, the Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s nose horn was now one meter long. It no longer had its smooth curves, and it was razor-sharp with multiple angles. Each of the angles was sharp like a blade.The two horns on the head, which were originally around 30cm in length, were now one meter long too.The horns weren\u2019t straight and were more like a bull\u2019s horns, curved and meant for charging. They were heavy and filled with power, as though they were made to penetrate the enemy.Lin Yuan was certain that this Sharp Rock Bull\u2019s evolution into the Sharp Iron Horn Bull was in the ancestry line\u2019s direction, enhancing its physical capability.Lin Yuan had actually witnessed the process of an Elite fey evolving into a Bronze one. He had witnessed the metamorphosis of life.While feeling the metamorphosis of life from where he stood, he felt his spirit getting enlightened. It was a kind of uplifting feeling that could only be felt when creating life.It was the same as seeking the legendary chapter of the book that contained the meaning of life.After the Sharp Rock Bull evolved, there were three exclusive skills to choose from due to its Epic quality.2[Scaled Skin]: The skin develops a layer of scaled armor-like skin that has a similar composition to the skin.[Trudge]: Stamina can be reserved when sprinting.[Pain Absorption]: When receiving damage, absorb a portion of the damage and turn it into vitality.6After reading through the three exclusive skills, Lin Yuan fell deep in thought.Among the three skills, two of them were rather good. The Sharp Iron Horn Bull was a defense-type fey, so Trudge was obviously useless.Scaled Skin was an exclusive skill that allowed the Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s current iron-like skin to develop a layer of thicker scaled armor. The scaled armor would also have the same properties of the Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s skin, enhancing its defensive capability.At the same time, when the Sharp Iron Horn Bull was charging, if the scaled armor scraped on the target, its sharp edges would also injure the enemy.The other exclusive skill, Pain Absorption, was rather interesting. When receiving damage, it allowed a portion of the damage to be absorbed and used to recover.It was something that an iron fool would wish for, a skill that was even more extreme and complementing.After a short conflict, Lin Yuan chose Pain Absorption.Pain Absorption could be effectively used with the skill Sacrifice. The Scaled Skin might produce an additional layer of skin armor, but if the enemy could slice open the Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s original skin, then the scaled armor would naturally be sliced open too. Hence, after a quick comparison, Pain Absorption was definitely superior.When Lin Yuan chose the exclusive skill, Pain Absorption, the Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s evolution was finally completed. The normal-grade and elite-grade learned skills would also undergo slight changes.4[Fey Name]: Sharp Iron Horn Bull[Fey Species]: Horned species/Bull species[Fey Grade]: Bronze (1/10)[Fey Type]: Metal[Fey Quality]: Normal1Abilities:[Rock Horn]: Apply a layer of metal on the horns and enhance the nose horn\u2019s metallic properties. Disregard injuries and smash into the enemy with full strength.2[Sacrifice]: When the contractor is injured, automatically split the damage with the contractor.Exclusive Skill:[Pain Absorption]: When receiving damage, absorb a portion of the damage and turn it into vitality.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t be more satisfied with the Sharp Iron Horn Bull before him. However, the more Lin Yuan observed the Sharp Iron Horn Bull, the more he felt it was like a power offense-type fey that had a defensive layer of skin.Be it the abilities or the exclusive skill, they were all very good combinations for the Sharp Iron Horn Bull. For it to be Chu Ci\u2019s first fey, it was simply as fitting as it could be.But for a girl to contract a Sharp Iron Horn Bull, it was rather strange, just like the Beauty and the Beast.4However, this Sharp Iron Horn Bull was already the best defense-type fey that Lin Yuan could obtain with his current abilities.After evolving the Sharp Iron Horn Bull, Lin Yuan felt that the increase of spiritual power in his body was the same as evolving 30 pots of Elite Usneas.1Lin Yuan concluded that evolving high-grade feys would allow his spiritual power to increase more. It was fortunate that the Sharp Rock Bull was an Elite X fey. Otherwise, it would have been impossible for Lin Yuan to evolve it to bronze-grade in such a short period.1When looking at the dark blue and hazy sky, Lin Yuan immediately arranged for Bronze air transportation with his mobile phone. While waiting for the avian fey to arrive, Lin Yuan prepared dinner for Genius and Chimey. At the same time, he also fed the Sharp Iron Horn Bull with some Usnea vines.2He then stored the Bronze Sharp Iron Horn Bull in the bronze-grade spirit storage box. Soon enough, a Bronze avian fey arrived at the alley.Lin Yuan grabbed onto the spirit storage box and bade farewell to Genius and Chimey, which had been chirping non-stop after waking up. He then boarded on the avian fey.While riding the Bronze Black-Winged Windfalcon in the night, he flew toward Chu Ci\u2019s school.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It was using its beak to accurately take the portions and put them in the crystal bottle.Not far away from the woman in the moonlight robes were a man and a woman. The man had a dignified look, while the woman looked heroic.The two of them were using their spirit qi to conceal their presence as they were afraid they might disturb the woman that was adjusting the medicine concoction.Their bodies\u2019 spirit qi was emitting a vague, mysterious, and runic aura. It indicated that the two of them were king-class experts that had comprehended the Willpower Runes from a certain mountain, river, ocean, or sky.2However, the two king-class experts were looking at this woman with extreme respect.The woman in the moonlight robes was using her spirit qi to vibrate the concoction. The medicinal smell was flowing out of the bottle, and the refreshing plant fragrance was like the smell of grass being split open after a rain. It truly gladdened the heart.When the concoction was mixed with the three portions of Hyssop Sprouts that the Vine Bird brought, it emitted a fragrance as though a giant tree instantly grew out from the place where the grass had been sliced open.2The giant tree started to get surrounded by greenery, forming a primitive forest.As the woman in the moonlight robes poured the dark red Platinum Beast\u2019s blood inside, the fragrance suddenly exploded with intense and horrifying prowess. It felt just like ferocious beasts prowling in the depths of the primitive forest and waiting to strike at the prey.The two king-class experts\u2019 foreheads were covered with perspiration as they felt rather nervous due to the prowling beasts\u2019 threatening presence.1The woman in the moonlight robes constantly injected her spiritual power into the crystal bottle. The spirit qi had stirred and fused the emerald-colored concoction and the dark red beast blood into an amber color, which was sparkling and limpid.After stirring for around ten minutes, the woman stopped.She picked up the Deep Sea Ebony and smelled it as though she was trying to determine the Deep Sea Ebony\u2019s age. Subsequently, she used her spiritual power to crush the Deep Sea Ebony into dust and poured it into the amber fluid.As soon as the Deep Sea Ebony was mixed into the amber fluid, it turned dark green.The primitive forest that was originally prowling with beasts suddenly acted out a part of history that was over 2,000,000 years ago, as there was heavy rain that would only appear during the Carnian period.1The primitive forest was instantly flooded and turned into a deep sea. The beasts in the forest that were waiting to strike had all turned into swelling corpses.The two king-class experts first felt their legs getting tangled by layers of water plants before their necks were also tangled. It felt like they were going to be sealed in this dark green, deep sea for eternity.At that moment, the woman in the moonlight robes started to stir the fluid with her spirit qi. Every time she moved, it would be like a reincarnation cycle.Those beasts in the sea that were already dead had suddenly revived, while those tangling water plants had also released their grip, turning back into the plants that lived between the reef.Light and darkness, new life and decay\u2026 Whenever the woman moved her hands, the two polar opposites would switch.Finally, the dark green medicinal fluid was stirred by the spiritual power and turned into an emerald green color with a sparkling luster.At the instant the fluid turned sparkling, the suffocating deep sea, the water plants, and the beasts vanished.There was only the sound and serenity of \u2018the falling sunset when a solitary duck was flying when the limpid autumn waters were the same color as the sky\u2019.2At that moment, the two king-class experts took a deep breath and withdrew the spirit qi protecting their bodies.The dignified man quickly went over and asked, \u201cMoon Empress, thank you for the hard work! I wonder if\u2026 this concoction is completed?\u201dThe woman in the moonlight robes lifted her head and emitted an aura that was like the moon\u2019s splendor.\u201cSummon your fey, Si Kong.\u201dThe dignified middle-aged man responded by immediately summoning his fey, which was a giant tiger beast.The woman in the moonlight robes shook her wrist, and the emerald fluid turned into a streak of fragrance. It entered the giant tiger\u2019s body through the nostrils.Subsequently, the giant tiger fey\u2019s body started cracking as though it was experiencing a new life.The woman in the moonlight robes nodded and said, \u201cIts quality has evolved from Epic to Legend. As long as you fuse the Willpower Runes that you comprehended with the fey, it can evolve into the Fantasy Breed.\u201dSi Kong was overjoyed by the statement and quickly bowed. \u201cMoon Empress, if you need my assistance in the future, just inform me! I will not cower and risk my life to complete your request!\u201dThe woman in the moonlight robes shook her hand and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to risk your life. You already helped This Empress to find a pair of dragon beast eyes. Consider this your reward.\u201dAfter hearing the Moon Empress\u2019 reply, the dignified man quickly cupped his fist again and said, \u201cSi Kong is willing to serve the Moon Empress with loyalty.\u201dAt that moment, the giant tiger fey completed its evolution and quietly awakened. When it felt its changes, it let out an invigorated growl. All of a sudden, its voice was stuck in the throat. The tiger beast then lay down sullenly.A small rabbit on the table pulled a finger-sized carrot out of a jade flower pot. Some red crystal-like sand was also pulled out.The small rabbit looked at the sand with dislike before kicking the sand off the table and leisurely nibbling the carrot.The Green Vine Bird that was preparing the ingredients earlier habitually and quickly picked up the red crystal sand grains on the ground and placed them back into the jade flower pot.The giant tiger fey had stopped growling because the little rabbit had taken a casual glance at it when it had been pulling the carrot.The Moon Empress carried the little rabbit and said to Si Kong, \u201cThe Creation Master exams have always been conducted rank by rank since it started. After each successful attempt at the promotion exams, Creation Masters will need to wait for three years before participating in the promotion exams. How can we pick out any Creation Masters with true talents like this? Si Kong, inform the Creation Master Association that if anyone passes the Creation Master exam within two hours, they can choose to bypass the three lifestyle occupations\u2019 promotion exams and immediately attempt for the Rank 2 Creation Master exam.\u201d3Si Kong memorized the Moon Empress\u2019 instructions before asking, \u201cMoon Empress, what about the promotion exam for Rank 3 Creation Master? Can they also choose to directly promote after passing the Rank 2 exam?\u201d\u201cIt is only allowed for promotion from Rank 1 to Rank 2.\u201d2The Moon Empress picked up the crystal bottle again after speaking in preparation to concoct another medicinal fluid. She was hinting for them to leave.Si Kong stored the fey, whose quality had just evolved to Legend, before bowing and quickly attending to the task requested by the Moon Empress.At that moment, the female king-class expert that was emitting a heroic aura finally spoke. \u201cMoon Empress, do you feel that there haven\u2019t been enough outstanding young individuals among the federation\u2019s Creation Masters during the past few years? Therefore, you wish to make a change?\u201dThe Moon Empress shook her head and said, \u201cThis is merely This Empress\u2019 personal matter. The Bamboo Monarch and the Chef Supreme have already taken in disciples. This Empress must not fall behind those two old things.\u201d3The heroic lady was shocked by the reply.\u00a0The Moon Empress is actually planning to accept a disciple. This is shocking news!4As one of the Radiance Federation\u2019s three Rank 5 Creation Masters, becoming the Moon Empress\u2019 disciple was the same as ascending to heaven.However, it was unknown which city the Moon Empress\u2019 disciple would be from. If that disciple came from Redbud City, as the Redbud City governor, she would definitely receive plenty of rewards from the Moon Empress.\u201cLing Xiao, do you know that the Xia Region under your Redbud City has a new Class-1 dimensional rift?\u201dThe heroic lady immediately replied, \u201cLing Xiao has already received the Redbud Guards\u2019 report. Does Moon Empress have any instructions?\u201dThe heroic lady felt a little suspicious.\u00a0Why would an influential person like the Moon Empress mention a mere Class-1 dimensional rift?\u201cThis Empress heard that the dimensional rifts have been unstable lately. It is probably due to the arrival of the dimensional wave. During each dimensional wave, the dimensional rifts with alien insects are always the most dangerous. Your Redbud City has the most Insect Dimensional Rifts. Send more guards to the Insect Dimensional Rifts\u2019 entrances to prevent them from threatening the lives of the nearby citizens during the dimensional wave.\u201dAfter receiving the Moon Empress\u2019 instructions, Ling Xiao quickly replied, \u201cMoon Empress, you don\u2019t have to worry. As Redbud City\u2019s governor, as long as Ling Xiao is around, Ling Xiao shall be Redbud City\u2019s pillar.\u201dThe Moon Empress nodded and said to Ling Xiao, \u201cSi Kong\u2019s task might need a period of time before it takes effect. Why don\u2019t you return to Redbud City and apply the new rules of the Creation Master exam for Redbud City\u2019s Creation Master Association first?\u201d\u201cLing Xiao acknowledges the order!\u201dAfter speaking, Ling Xiao felt rather astonished in her heart. The Moon Empress had emphasized on the Creation Master exam\u2019s problem twice. It seemed like the Moon Empress was really determined to accept a disciple.4\u2026At that moment, Lin Yuan was still riding on the Black-Winged Windfalcon and looking down at the mountains and the vast land.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, it had a very flat back, and the feathers on its back were very thick.Therefore, the Black-Winged Windfalcon was rather popular among the Bronze avian feys.This trip\u2019s travel fee was nearly half of the store\u2019s normal revenue, 2,000 Federation dollars. If Lin Yuan weren\u2019t in a hurry, he wouldn\u2019t be willing to spend like this.\u201cYoung lad, if you are used to the feeling of flying in the sky, I will let the Black-Winged Windfalcon fly a little higher. When at the altitude of the clouds, the air current is relatively calm, and the speed can be faster.\u201d1The Black-Winged Windfalcon\u2019s pilot knew that Lin Yuan was riding an avian fey for the first time and was nice enough not to let the Black-Winged Windfalcon travel in the high altitudes immediately.1The air in the high altitudes was thinner. Thus, those who had never ridden on avian feys before might suffer a temporary lack of oxygen due to the sudden change of altitude and faint.1Lin Yuan nodded and said, \u201cAlright then! I am ready!\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s expression turned pale as he spoke. When looking at the ground, which was dozens of meters away, and the blurry figures of people in the street at night, Lin Yuan felt a little acrophobic. Fortunately, the acrophobic feeling wasn\u2019t too intense, and he was able to endure it.The pilot gave the command for the Black-Winged Windfalcon to ascend toward the clouds. When ascending, the Black-Winged Windfalcon erected the feathers on its back to help Lin Yuan block off the oncoming air currents.Soon enough, the Black-Winged Windfalcon reached the level of the clouds and stabilized its flight.3The air above the clouds was indeed thinner, but it wasn\u2019t scorching hot. When Lin Yuan inhaled the refreshing cold wind, he felt a sense of urgency due to the lack of oxygen that made his lungs tingle.Lin Yuan circulated his spirit qi, and the sense of urgency quickly vanished. He looked around the surroundings and noticed bundles of clouds nearby that felt like they could be touched.Lin Yuan reached out. It was unknown whether it was due to grabbing the clouds or feeling unsatisfied in the clouds, but Lin Yuan actually looked down and was surprised.When riding in the clouds, the acrophobic feeling vanished and was replaced by extreme spaciousness and clarity.2The rivers looked like jade belts, while the mountains were vast and towering. At the places where the mountains intersected, they looked just like the land\u2019s spine. They had been like this since the beginning of time and were like the land\u2019s eternal veins and arteries.1At that moment, Lin Yuan could see a damaged mountain range from afar. A few months back, two Gold beasts had caused this scale of destruction.The flames from the Gold fire-type fey had incinerated the plants on the mountain. After being scorched by the flames, this should be a barren mountain. However, after months of rain, there was now a thin layer of greenery.Lin Yuan suddenly felt a surge of enlightenment in his heart.Below the green mountain is Mother Earth\u2026Mother Earth bestowed vitality to the green mountain, while the green mountain returned the favor by providing lustrous greenery\u2026The green mountain is the manifestation of Mother Earth\u2019s vitality, and it\u2019s a type of vitality that even surging flames couldn\u2019t eliminate\u2026Lin Yuan looked down at the green mountain and felt it was particularly clear in his eyes. It felt as though the green mountain\u2019s willpower was like the chilling cold air in the high altitudes and was easily absorbed into Lin Yuan\u2019s lungs.In the depths of Lin Yuan\u2019s mind, there was a sudden surge in spiritual energy, and a verdant mountain was erected in the spiritual world.When Lin Yuan\u2019s weak spiritual energy was fused into the mountain, the mountain instantly transformed into a green rune. The rune was filled with the veins of mountains and immense vitality.As the rune danced around Lin Yuan\u2019s spiritual energy, it felt as though it was nourishing Lin Yuan\u2019s spiritual energy. Lin Yuan felt his mind in a state of clarity.When looking back at the green mountain range, it was another scenery. Due to this clear and sudden understanding of the mountains, Lin Yuan nearly bit off his tongue.This, this, this\u2026 I just comprehended a kind of mountain willpower. Furthermore, the mountain willpower already formed a rune!1If some of the experts learned of Lin Yuan\u2019s situation, they would probably be seething with anger. In order to produce a Fantasy Breed, a Bronze fey\u2019s quality would need to have reached Legend.1Afterward, the contractor would need to comprehend a Willpower Rune and fuse it with the Bronze/Legend fey. From there, the fey would comprehend the spiritual willpower, and a transformation would happen, turning the fey into a Fantasy Breed.2Although a legend-quality fey was extremely hard to find, with the aid of a Creation Master and dedication in nurturing, there was a possibility.However, a Willpower Rune from the mountains, rivers, oceans, and skies could only be observed and comprehended by the spirit qi professionals.Plenty of spirit qi professionals were stuck without the Willpower Runes. Even if they possessed legend-quality feys, they wouldn\u2019t be able to evolve them into the Fantasy Breed.This was the first time Lin Yuan was riding an avian fey and looking down at the mountains and vast land. Yet he actually comprehended a type of Willpower Rune from the mountains. Lin Yuan was truly amazed.When a person was unlucky, they might have stuffed teeth when drinking cool water. Or when they poured a glass of water, the pot might break off from the handle and smash on their feet.But when a person was lucky, they would be able to get the grand prize by opening a single bottle.2Ever since I started feeling the spirit qi\u2019s presence, my great luck has been constantly around.Evolving feys\u2019 quality to Legend is just a matter of time for me. Now that I comprehended a Willpower Rune, I will be able to obtain a Fantasy Breed.5However, the Willpower Rune\u2019s attribute must be complementing the fey in order for it to be effective.If one comprehended a Willpower Rune from the land, they could still use it on an aquatic fey to evolve it into a Fantasy Breed.When evolving into the Fantasy Breed, the second exclusive skill would be related to the land due to the Willpower Rune\u2019s attribute. It would be useless for the fey. It wouldn\u2019t just be wasting a Willpower Rune, but it would also be wasting the legend-quality fey\u2019s talent.1Therefore, Lin Yuan would need to consider the first fey that he was going to use Morbius\u2019 Spirit Lock skill on, as he would need to complement it with the Willpower Rune comprehended from the mountain.1Time passed quickly, and just as Lin Yuan returned to his senses from his spiritual world, the Black-Winged Windfalcon was already preparing to land in the light-illuminated city.The city that they were landing at was none other than Redbud City\u2019s main city.4The Black-Winged Windfalcon was going to land directly at the entrance of the Redbud Intermediate Spirit Qi Academy.Lin Yuan carried the spirit storage box containing the Sharp Iron Horn Bull and alighted the Black-Winged Windfalcon. He then immediately made a call to Chu Ci.Lin Yuan had a very special aura, just like the grass after the rain, which was particularly clean.Now that Lin Yuan\u2019s body had recovered, his originally good looks were no longer as pale. He was rosy and filled with energy. As such, many of the female students that were returning to the academy after their meals and walks were looking at Lin Yuan.3At that moment, Lin Yuan\u2019s phone call connected.When Lin Yuan made the call, he was rather angry when thinking of how Chu Ci had wanted to contract a Gray Beetle without telling him.However, when he heard Chu Ci immediately apologizing and talking hesitantly, Lin Yuan\u2019s anger was immediately dismissed.2His mouth revealed a happy, helpless, and also pampering smile. \u201cWhere are you now? I am at your academy\u2019s entrance.\u201dWhile he was speaking, Lin Yuan heard a familiar voice from the other end of the phone. The voice belonged to the irascible Teacher Bao.\u201cChu Ci, your teacher is only so capable. Just take this Elite Yellow-Spotted Hound. Otherwise, if you don\u2019t have a fey when you register tomorrow, you will immediately fail in your live combat class.\u201d2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Why are you only here now? Are you not concerned about Chu Ci\u2019s academics?!\u201d1Teacher Bao suddenly recalled something, causing his words to get stuck in his throat. He had read her file and knew about her family situation. How could he blame a boy for doing his best to support his young sister to school? How could he blame the boy for not being capable enough to bring a good fey for his younger sister?2When Lin Yuan heard the irascible Teacher Bao\u2019s voice, he quickly said, \u201cTeacher Bao, thank you for your kindness toward Chu Ci. I have prepared a fey for Chu Ci. I am at the academy\u2019s entrance now. But I am not a student and cannot enter the premises. Could you ask Chu Ci to meet me at the entrance?\u201dAfter Lin Yuan finished talking, Teacher Bao immediately responded, \u201cWait at the entrance for a moment. I will bring Chu Ci to pick you up. By then, you need to help me persuade Chu Ci.\u201dBefore handing the mobile phone back to Chu Ci, Teacher Bao had already ended the phone call. He was truly a resolute and straightforward teacher.However, Lin Yuan felt it was rather strange.Why did Teacher Bao\u2019s attitude toward me suddenly turn better?1Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know that Teacher Bao\u2019s change in attitude was due to his understanding of their family situation. If Lin Yuan knew of this, he would probably let out an awkward smile.When other children had been enjoying their innocent childhood in the embrace of their parents, he had had no choice but to be independent and care for his younger sister.They had suffered in the cold, they had been starved, they had been seriously ill, but they had still survived stubbornly until now. They had never taken advantage of others, nor had they ever accepted charity from others. They might be poor, but they had self-respect, self-love, and never stopped improving themselves.1Lin Yuan had never been self-abased about his situation, nor he ever felt that Chu Ci had to be self-abased either. They had always been righteous and honest. They had never done anything that they should be ashamed of, even though their path had been difficult.Lin Yuan waited by the entrance. When the female students noticed that he wasn\u2019t going to leave for the moment, they gathered their courage, approached Lin Yuan quietly, and asked for Lin Yuan\u2019s Star Web account.Lin Yuan felt rather exhausted when dealing with them. Fortunately, after rejecting a few of them, no one else asked for his Star Web account. Well, some of them kept looking at him constantly.Lin Yuan heaved a sigh of relief because of this.After a short moment, a beautiful figure rushed toward the Redbud Spirit Qi Intermediate Academy entrance. The beautiful figure originally wanted to jump into Lin Yuan\u2019s embrace, but she seemingly recalled something and timidly stood in front of him when she got closer.She then spoke in a pitiful tone. \u201cBig Brother, I was wrong! I shouldn\u2019t have attempted to form a contract with the Gray Beetle.\u201dLin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but ridicule inside his heart.\u00a0If this lass didn\u2019t make a mistake, how could she possibly call me Big Brother? Normally, she would definitely be calling Lin Yuan every time.3\u201cDo you think I am just angry about this!? This decision impacts your future! Not only did you not discuss with me about your first fey, but you weren\u2019t even planning to tell me about forming a contract!?\u201dLin Yuan was very stern when speaking. However, he noticed that Chu Ci\u2019s eyes were turning red, so he softened his tone.At that moment, Teacher Bao\u2019s voice echoed. \u201cChu Ci, why were you running so fast? Why didn\u2019t you wait for your teacher! Your teacher isn\u2019t some combat-class professional.\u201dTeacher Bao was a Spiritual Ingredient Analyst and was the one that taught the Spiritual Ingredient class. He had been chasing after Chu Ci, so he was rather exhausted.Lin Yuan quickly took a step forward and greeted Teacher Bao.Teacher Bao took a glance at Lin Yuan and immediately regretted how severe his tone was when talking on the phone. Upon looking at Lin Yuan\u2019s clean and tidy clothes, which had already faded due to overwashing, he could tell that this youth had been very thrifty in his lifestyle.\u201cYou are Chu Ci\u2019s elder brother, right? How are you? I\u2019ve been a homeroom teacher for many years, but Chu Ci is the most talented student I\u2019ve ever taught. She is very diligent and takes her studies seriously.\u201cAs such, the matter of picking her first fey must not be neglected. It is best if her first fey is an Elite one. If it is a Normal fey, the time required for it to become Elite will certainly waste Chu Ci\u2019s potential.\u201dTeacher Bao\u2019s tone was not as domineering after meeting Lin Yuan. He was carefully explaining Chu Ci\u2019s situation and also emphasizing on the importance of the first fey.Evidently, Teacher Bao had a plan. If Lin Yuan had brought a Normal fey for Chu Ci, Teacher Bao would give Chu Ci the Yellow-Spotted Hound he had purchased with his own money.The Yellow-Spotted Hound might not be considered outstanding among the Elite defense-type feys, but it wouldn\u2019t waste too much of Chu Ci\u2019s talent.Lin Yuan seldom visited Chu Ci\u2019s school, and this was the first time he heard a teacher praising his sister before him. Lin Yuan felt involuntarily proud of his younger sister.Chu Ci was secretly tugging at the corner of Lin Yuan\u2019s clothes and blinking her eyes at him.3She was well-aware of their financial situation. Although Lin Yuan might have brought a Normal fey, she didn\u2019t wish to accept Teacher Bao\u2019s Elite fey.Given Lin Yuan\u2019s temperament, Chu Ci knew that if she accepted Teacher Bao\u2019s Yellow-Spotted, her brother would surely use the shortest period of time to gather the money required to buy an Elite Yellow-Spotted Hound and repay Teacher Bao.Chu Ci hadn\u2019t informed Lin Yuan about her decision to contract a Gray Beetle because she hadn\u2019t wanted Lin Yuan to suffer. It was the same right now.Lin Yuan lifted the spirit storage box and placed it in front of Teacher Bao.\u201cTeacher Bao, I am grateful for your help. I have brought a rather good fey to Chu Ci. I wonder if there is a suitable place for Chu Ci to form the contract with this fey?\u201dAfter listening to Lin Yuan\u2019s response, Teacher Bao immediately wanted to ask what that fey\u2019s grade was.However, when he recalled they were still before the academy\u2019s entrance, he said, \u201cIt just so happens that the deadline for students to report their first fey ends tonight. Go to my office then! Once Chu Ci is done with the contract, I will report it for her.\u201dLin Yuan looked at Chu Ci and placed the spirit storage box in her hands. \u201cThe fey you will form a contract with is in here. Hold the box first and get close to it.\u201dSoon, the massive spirit storage box was gently hovering over Chu Ci\u2019s hand. The spirit storage box might not have any weight, but Chu Ci felt that it was heavy and crucial when holding it.2At the same time, Teacher Bao\u2019s eyes were also looking closely at the spirit storage box.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

All of a sudden, his irises contracted as he recognized the marking at the side of the spirit storage box.It\u2019s a bronze-grade spirit storage box!Originally, Teacher Bao had wanted to mention the Yellow-Spotted Hound, but he held back. Although he didn\u2019t know if this spirit storage box contained a Bronze fey, he believed it was definitely better than the Yellow-Spotted Hound.After all, the amount needed to purchase a single Ostrich Logistics bronze-grade spirit storage box was enough to buy three Yellow-Spotted Hounds.As they walked inside the campus, Lin Yuan suddenly felt relaxed after seeing all the young and vibrant smiling faces. At the same time, Lin Yuan felt very glad that he had chosen to support Chu Ci to attend school instead of managing the fey store with him.Once they entered Teacher Bao\u2019s office, Lin Yuan saw a cage that contained a healthy Yellow-Spotted Hound. Evidently, Teacher Bao was planning to give it to Chu Ci.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know how to thank Teacher Bao. Although he might have enough money in his Star Web account to purchase dozens of Yellow-Spotted Hounds, kindness couldn\u2019t be measured by money, especially the kind that didn\u2019t seek repayment.Teacher Bao sat in the office chair and said to Lin Yuan, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you to actually prepare such a good fey after telling you to do so.\u201dTeacher Bao looked at Lin Yuan and lamented.\u00a0If this bronze-grade spirit storage box really contains a Bronze fey, even if it is a regular Bronze defense-type fey, it isn\u2019t something that I can obtain.I wonder how a youth like him was able to obtain something this great\u2026Teacher Bao found the thought of Chu Ci wasting her talent unbearable previously, but he was feeling heartbroken for Lin Yuan now.2Teacher Bao\u2019s words left Chu Ci rather confused. She, who had been holding this spirit storage box, didn\u2019t know what was inside, so how could Teacher Bao know?Lin Yuan noticed Chu Ci\u2019s confused expression and said, \u201cChu Ci, bring out your first fey and form a contract.\u201dChu Ci dismissed her doubts and placed her hand on the spirit storage box\u2019s lock. After injecting her spirit qi and opening the spirit storage box, a majestic ink-colored iron bull appeared. Its head was equipped with abnormally sharp horns.Chu Ci involuntarily let out a gasp.Teacher Bao also dropped the pen he was holding and exclaimed, \u201cIt is actually a Bronze Sharp Iron Horn Bull! Furthermore, this Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s appearance seems to be distinctively in the ancestry line.\u201cThe nose horn at the front is actually so long! The quality of this Sharp Iron Horn Bull is definitely top-notch among the Bronze defense-type feys.\u201cTake a look at the nose horn. It is a great ingredient that can be used to promote a fey\u2019s quality. Just this horn alone is worth 700,000 Federation dollars.\u201dOnce Teacher Bao stopped talking, the Sharp Iron Horn Bull let out a moo and knocked its hind hooves against the ground.Lin Yuan looked at Teacher Bao with an incredulous expression. A Bronze fey\u2019s spirituality allowed it to sense what the humans surrounding it were thinking. Teacher Bao\u2019s reaction after seeing the Sharp Iron Horn Bull was to put a price on its nose horn. It truly agitated the bull.Teacher Bao picked up the dropped pen and laughed in embarrassment. \u201cIt\u2019s my old habit. It is a Spiritual Ingredient Analyst\u2019s occupational habit. Haha.\u201dChu Ci was staring blankly at the Sharp Iron Horn Bull, while tears were flowing her cheeks.Lin Yuan stepped forward to wipe off Chu Ci\u2019s tears and asked, \u201cWhat are you crying for?\u201dLin Yuan was a rather reserved person and didn\u2019t know how to express his emotions or console others.4Chu Ci looked at Lin Yuan and asked, \u201cLin Yuan! Did you sell our store!?\u201dChu Ci might not know this Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s value, but based on Teacher Bao\u2019s reaction and the fey\u2019s appearance, she could tell it was not cheap.Teacher Bao left his office and closed the door for Lin Yuan and Chu Ci.Lin Yuan rubbed Chu Ci\u2019s head and said, \u201cHurry up and form a contract with it. Teacher Bao still has to report it later. Do not increase Teacher Bao\u2019s workload. When we go out for dinner later, we will talk more.\u201dLin Yuan circulated his spirit qi while talking.Chu Ci exclaimed in joy, \u201cLin Yuan, you can feel spirit qi! Then your body\u2026\u201dLin Yuan put on a warm smile. \u201cI am fine now.\u201dChu Ci\u2019s tears were quietly flowing down earlier, but now, she couldn\u2019t help it and started to wail. She was crying and laughing at the same time.Upon seeing the panicked Lin Yuan, Chu Ci said, \u201cLet me cry for a moment. These are tears of joy.\u201dChu Ci cried for five minutes. During these five minutes, the tears were the saltiest, but Chu Ci was enjoying the happiest five minutes.After forming the contract with the Sharp Iron Horn Bull, Chu Ci stored it inside her spiritual storage box.When Teacher Bao noticed that the commotion was over, he opened the door and just happened to see the scene of Chu Ci forming the contract.He said in an emotional tone, \u201cChu Ci\u2019s talent is already top-notch. Now that she is starting with a superior Bronze Sharp Iron Horn Bull, Chu Ci might have the chance to participate in the Redbud Hundred\u2019s selection during the year-end.\u201dWhen Teacher Bao mentioned the Redbud Hundred, Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cAren\u2019t only third-year students eligible to participate in the Redbud Hundred? Chu Ci is only a first-year!\u201dTeacher Bao looked at Chu Ci with limitless expectations and said, \u201cThe Redbud Hundred\u2019s selection involves picking out 100 young individuals from Redbud City and giving them the qualification to participate in the Radiance Hundred.\u201cIn order to qualify for 80 of those spots, one has to go through actual combat. As for the remaining 20 spots, they are for seeded participants. As for the criteria, it\u2019s their potential and talents.\u201cChu Ci is entirely capable of striving for those 20 spots. If Chu Ci succeeds, she will obtain the education resources Redbud City sponsors to our Redbud Intermediate Spirit Qi Academy. She would then be able to develop even better. However, all this is still depending on Chu Ci\u2019s hard work.\u201dChu Ci nodded with determination. She was naturally going to do her best and strive for it. Otherwise, she would be letting down Lin Yuan\u2019s contribution.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t really care about the sponsorship of resources. With him around, every time Chu Ci returned home during the holidays, he would be able to improve her contracted fey.Furthermore, he would nurture all of Chu Ci\u2019s future contracted feys, so she wouldn\u2019t need to rely on others for resources.Lin Yuan was more concerned about the academy\u2019s atmosphere and environment. To be competing against similar-aged individuals in this place was actually a type of growth.Such growth might be displayed with one\u2019s strength, but it was more a growth in spirit.Lin Yuan wanted to bring Chu Ci out for a meal, so she requested to take a break.Teacher Bao immediately approved Chu Ci\u2019s request.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am preparing to participate in the Creation Master exam soon.\u201dLin Yuan summarized the situation and his plans. He didn\u2019t wish to hide his participation in the Creation Master exam from Chu Ci.Creation Masters were akin to celebrities of the pre-Spirit Qi Awakening era. They would be introduced on the Star Web, so it was impossible to conceal it. He might as well tell Chu Ci and let her have peace of mind.2Chu Ci looked at Lin Yuan and felt that he had changed significantly. Of course, the changes had to do with his physical appearance, as Lin Yuan\u2019s heart was still the same.Lin Yuan might have said that things were relatively good recently, but Chu Ci knew that he would always mention the good news and not the bad news. Therefore, she was still a little worried.\u201cLin Yuan, that Sharp Iron Horn Bull must be very expensive, right?\u201dLin Yuan laughed mischievously and took out his Star Web Card while speaking. \u201cI now have the talent of a Creation Master and have earned some money. We have money now! Later on, I will transfer 100,000 Federation dollars to your Star Web Card. If you need any resources in school, just buy them. The Sharp Iron Horn Bull needs a large number of energy ores. We will purchase those strong and tough metals too.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan was speaking, he was genuinely happy. It wasn\u2019t because they were rich now. He could finally provide a great cultivating environment for Chu Ci. The feeling was truly carefree.Chu Ci nodded obediently and didn\u2019t object. From the tender age of six, when Lin Yuan was eight years old, he had been supporting her and their store. They were each other\u2019s closest family members in this world.5Chu Ci always had a certain reliance on Lin Yuan, and it was a feeling that originated from their bloodline and kinship.8At that moment, a stall owner in the street called out loudly, \u201cChinese cornbread! Four for 1 Federation dollar! Come here, come now!\u201dWhen Chu Ci heard the stall owner\u2019s sales pitch, she laughed and said to her brother, \u201cLin Yuan, I want to eat Chinese cornbread.\u201dLin Yuan looked at the stall and said, \u201cHaven\u2019t you always wanted to eat hotpot? If you eat Chinese cornbread now, your stomach won\u2019t digest fast enough for you to finish your hotpot.\u201dChu Ci took a look at the cornbread and let out a sweet smile. \u201cI want both cornbread and hotpot!\u201dLin Yuan went to purchase cornbread helplessly. Chu Ci looked at his back and felt as though time had suddenly returned to several years ago.Back then, she had been severely ill, and her condition had been getting worse. Lin Yuan had gone to look for a Healer to treat her, but the treatment had cost too much. As a result, the two of them had to eat cornbread for half a month.Back then, whenever they ate cornbread, they would feel it was coarse, hard to swallow, and very plain. Now that everything was better, Chu Ci couldn\u2019t help but think of their past when seeing the cornbread.\u201cWhat are you thinking? Here is your cornbread, but don\u2019t eat too much. Otherwise, when we are eating hotpot, you can only watch me eat!\u201d\u201cBig Brother, I know already!\u201d1Chu Ci chewed on the cornbread. Although its taste was still the same as she remembered, Chu Ci could feel a hint of sweetness. It was unknown if they had added some sugar in the cornbread or if the cornbread actually had a unique taste in her heart.11\u2026After eating the hotpot, Lin Yuan sent Chu Ci back to the academy.There was always reluctance when parting, but their lives would continue getting better.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t ride on an aviant fey to return home. Instead, he had chosen to ride a Thick-Hoofed Donkey Car. Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t trying to save money, but he wished to see the mountain from the ground this time.At the same time, he was going to make a plan for his future.Lin Yuan no longer planned to open the fey store at home. It wasn\u2019t because he didn\u2019t wish to operate it, but he was planning to open a store on the Star Web. If he wanted to sell feys, he could just sell them on the Star Web.3He would arrange for Genius to memorize the primary books related to the Scholar, Fey Observer, and Spiritual Ingredient Analyst occupations after his return. He would then directly participate in the Creation Master exam.4Once he passed the Creation Master exam, he could authenticate himself on the Star Web and receive jobs for custom-made feys.3Spirit qi professionals would ultimately have to strengthen themselves in order to progress. Lin Yuan was also considered a spirit qi professional now. Therefore, after becoming a Creation Master, apart from increasing his spirit qi by evolving feys, he would only accept jobs like custom-made orders.Under normal circumstances, he would need to continue increasing his fey\u2019s grade. Now that he had a Willpower Rune, he wondered if he could increase a Bronze fey\u2019s quality to Legend and nurture a Bronze Fantasy Breed.When a fey transformed into a Fantasy Breed at a lower grade, it meant that the fey had greater potential.1\u2026It was daybreak, and soon the morning sun\u2019s redness soaked the entire mountain range. At the same time, the Thick-Hoofed Donkey Car delivered Lin Yuan back to the Xia Region.Lin Yuan had a breezy journey. He didn\u2019t walk back home immediately and instead headed to the fey marketplace to purchase 150 pots of Usneas that weren\u2019t even normal-grade. He then asked the stall owner to deliver them to his store.After making this bulk purchase of Usneas, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t plan to purchase any more feys from the marketplace. He was planning to purchase feys from the Star Web. Although the prices of feys were slightly higher on the Star Web due to the transportation fees, it had the advantage of being safe.7Before Lin Yuan became a Creation Master, he didn\u2019t wish to expose his fey-evolving ability.3After evolving all these 150 pots of Normal Usneas to Elite, Lin Yuan reckoned that his spirit qi would reach a D-rank spirit qi professional\u2019s standard. By then, he would be a true spirit qi professional that had a rank.Lin Yuan was already at the entrance of his store, but he suddenly had a thought.Morbius\u2019 Spirit Lock exclusive skill is due to my compatibility with healing-type, support-type, and plant-type. Therefore, I can only use the Spirit Lock on those types of feys.I had already decided to form a contract with a healing-type fey a long time ago. The Spirit Lock exclusive skill only allows the use of the fey\u2019s basic ability. It\u2019s also the ability that will be obtained by the fey at normal-grade.1There was an awkward matter about healing-type feys\u2019 normal-grade ability\u2026 Most of them didn\u2019t possess healing abilities, just like the Clear Pond Carp that Lin Yuan had encountered previously. It might be a healing-type fey, but its basic ability was to use the fins to deal physical damage. Thus, such feys were unsuitable for Spirit Lock.As for the basic abilities that could heal, the most clear-cut ability would be Jasmine Lily\u2019s Heal.Lin Yuan immediately decided that the first fey to use Morbius\u2019 Spirit Lock on was simply going to be Jasmine Lily.8Therefore, Lin Yuan returned to the fey marketplace, and purposely picked a Normal I/Normal Jasmine Lily.1He was preparing to use Spirit Lock on this pot of Jasmine Lily after going home.When Lin Yuan returned home, Genius and Chimey immediately pounced at him. Lin Yuan seldom went outdoors in the past because of his body condition. Hence, it was rare for him to leave Genius and Chimey. Lin Yuan had been out for an entire night, so Genius and Chimey were especially clingy toward him now.Their reliance and caring feelings made Lin Yuan feel warm.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As such, Lin Yuan immediately evolved one pot of Usnea into normal-grade and subsequently into elite-grade.He put it high on the rack and said to Chimey, \u201cChimey, in the future, that pot of Elite Usnea will be your food. When you reach the grade of Elite, I will prepare a Bronze Usnea for you.\u201dChimey flew happily to its Usnea and started singing a song.2A delicacy like the Elite Usnea was something that Chimey had a chance to eat during the past two days. Of course, Chimey was the most delighted because this pot of Elite Usnea was something that Lin Yuan had specially prepared for it.Lin Yuan took another bowl and placed some energy biscuits inside. These energy biscuits were meant for omnivorous feys, and they contained low-grade spiritual ingredients that were rich with nutrients. In other words, they weren\u2019t cheap.Naturally, Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t afford them in the past, but things were different now. As such, Lin Yuan changed Genius\u2019 diet too.Genius lowered its head and smelled the energy biscuits in the bowl. Its eyes lit up, and it started to chew on the energy biscuits with its small teeth in a very carefree manner.After preparing the food for Genius and Chimey, Lin Yuan went upstairs to shower. Subsequently, he was preparing to use Spirit Lock on the Jasmine Lily. Afterward, he would also be considered a combat-class spirit qi professional and a rare Healer.Healers were very respected among the combat-class spirit qi occupations, and it wasn\u2019t because they were rare.Healers might be considered a combat-class occupation, but they were mainly important for their healing abilities and didn\u2019t have outstanding combat capabilities.As a combat-class professional, Healers would also need to form teams with other combat-class professionals. They would need to fight in Star Web Tournaments or receive guild missions. All those places required them to be in danger.4Healers weren\u2019t able to protect themselves, so they had to rely on their teammates. The teammates would ensure the safety of healing-type spirit qi professionals, while the latter would nurture the entire team back to health. This was the main reason why Healers were respected.Of course, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t need to worry. His compatibility direction wasn\u2019t just to the healing-type but also toward the support-type.6The definition of a support-type was rather vague. When support-type spirit qi professionals contracted some specific support-type feys, they would provide control-type abilities or weaken-type abilities.4These abilities\u2019 damage value was already negligible, but everything had its advantages and disadvantages. Support-type spirit qi professionals that specialized in amplifications were more popular among the combat-class spirit qi professionals.As Morbius\u2019 grade increased, Lin Yuan would be able to use Spirit Lock on more feys. Therefore, Lin Yuan would be able to choose the combination of healing and support abilities.1They might be basic abilities, but as the feys evolved, their basic abilities would also be continuously enhanced, strengthening their effects.When the spirit-locked feys reached bronze-grade and obtained their exclusive skill, it would also enhance the basic abilities. In addition, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t think that basic abilities would be inferior.Since he had the ability to evolve feys, before they reached bronze-grade, they would surely reach epic-quality. He was only able to use the spirit-locked feys\u2019 basic abilities, so he didn\u2019t need to consider too much about the characteristics. He simply needed to choose based on the advantages of the basic abilities.2Lin Yuan would only need to choose the future spirit-locked feys based on their types to have a better ability combination.This was something that the other healing-type and support-type spirit qi professionals couldn\u2019t compare with him. Lin Yuan believed that he would definitely become an outstanding healing-type and support-type spirit qi professional.Lin Yuan looked at the frail Normal I/Normal Jasmine Lily in his hand. He gently rubbed the Jasmine Lily\u2019s leaf while thinking that this was going to be his first spirit-locked fey.This is just the beginning.Lin Yuan used his spiritual energy to communicate with Morbius that was on his right wrist and activated the exclusive skill, Spirit Lock.Lin Yuan felt his spiritual energy connecting deeply with Morbius, while the latter released spiritual energy toward Lin Yuan\u2019s choice and formed the contract with the Jasmine Lily.Soon, Spirit Lock was completed.Lin Yuan felt that Morbius\u2019 released spiritual energy was the spiritual energy he had used to form Morbius\u2019 contract. As for the spiritual energy that he possessed right now, there wasn\u2019t any consumption.3This meant that when Morbius used Spirit Lock, Lin Yuan would only need to use the spiritual energy to communicate with Morbius and wouldn\u2019t need to use his own spiritual energy.Lin Yuan always thought that he would need to reserve some spiritual energy to form the contract before using Spirit Lock.With that step skipped, Lin Yuan felt ecstatic.This means that I can still form a contract with another fey that only requires a small amount of spiritual energy. It doesn\u2019t matter if the fey isn\u2019t even normal-grade. After all, I can nurture it like how I nurture Genius and Chimey.Lin Yuan\u2019s mind raced with thoughts again.I am compatible with healing-type, support-type, and plant-type feys. Jasmine Lily is a healing-type and support-type fey, so I can now nurture another plant-type and combat-type fey. That way, I will be able to protect myself even if I am in the wilderness.4However, all the choices had to go through careful consideration.After Morbius used Spirit Lock successfully, Morbius\u2019 attributes changed.Lin Yuan immediately channeled spirit qi into the spirit-locked Jasmine Lily.After over an hour, the Normal I/Normal Jasmine Lily had reached Elite I/Elite.Presently, the Jasmine Lily\u2019s leaves were plump and tender green. The distinct layers of green made a person\u2019s mood better just by looking at them.At that moment, Lin Yuan checked on Morbius\u2019 attributes.[Fey Name]: Morbius[Fey Species]: ???[Fey Grade]: Elite (1/10)[Fey Type]: Spatial/Mystery[Fey Quality]: EliteAbilities:[True Data]: All complicated information that is invisible to the eye is turned into data. Information that is turned into data might contain truth that cannot be distinguished on the surface.[Calm Mind]: Passive ability. Effects of Calm Mind can be improved according to the fey\u2019s grade. Calm Mind can stabilize the mind and has a certain probability of resisting negative conditions.Exclusive Skill:[Spirit Lock]: Morbius\u2019 spatial zone can be used to nurture feys. The initial grade of the fey that Morbius\u2019 spatial zone can nurture must not be higher than Morbius\u2019 grade. Morbius isn\u2019t able to increase its grade by itself, so its grade will be increased along with the fey\u2019s grade that it nurtures. At the same time, Morbius can obtain the initial ability of the fey that it nurtures. However, Morbius will not obtain abilities when its grade increases. Whenever Morbius increases a grade, it will be able to nurture one more fey. Morbius\u2019 method of growth will remain unchanged.[Normal Spirit Lock]Jasmine Lily: Elite (1/10), Quality: EliteAbility: Heal \u2013 Recover open wounds.When the Jasmine Lily evolved in grade, Morbius had also reached Elite I/Elite. In addition, the Elite Morbius\u2019 Spirit Lock spatial zone transformed.Lin Yuan held the Jasmine Lily, entered the Spirit Lock spatial zone, and noticed that the spatial zone, which was originally 40 square meters, had expanded. It was twice the size, at least 80 square meters now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 28": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt that moment, Lin Yuan suddenly heard an unfamiliar and cold, but very amiable voice.\u201cYuan, I am finally able to communicate with you after I became Elite!\u201dThe voice echoed in Lin Yuan\u2019s mind, and he quickly reacted. This voice came from his first contracted fey, Morbius.Lin Yuan was overjoyed now that Morbius could converse with him. Feys were always the spirit qi professionals\u2019 closest partners. The previous time Lin Yuan could sense Morbius, the latter was so weak that it could only transmit fuzzy thoughts.Lin Yuan had been thinking of a method to strengthen Morbius\u2019 consciousness. He never expected that this problem would suddenly be resolved with Morbius\u2019 grade advancement.\u201cMoby, you were still so weak last time. Have you completely recovered now?\u201dA cold voice replied, \u201cI can only maintain this state for half an hour a day. Now that I have recovered, I wish to tell you about the function of the Spirit Lock\u2019s spatial zone.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan heard that Morbius could only maintain this state for half an hour a day, he was even more determined to quickly evolve the Elite Jasmine Lily to Bronze.By then, Morbius\u2019 condition would certainly improve.Humans could feel their fey\u2019s thoughts, and it was the same for the feys. Morbius\u2019 originally cold voice carried tinges of warmth now.\u201cYuan, this Spirit Lock spatial zone is like a small-scale dimensional zone. You can modify this spatial zone as you wish and store feys. It is just like a secret base.\u201dLin Yuan continued the conversation with Morbius. After Morbius explained the Spirit Lock spatial zone\u2019s function, they started to have a casual conversation.Morbius had transmigrated to this world along with Lin Yuan. When Lin Yuan had been born, Morbius already existed. They were just like twin brothers.4Lin Yuan and Morbius started to talk about anything they could, and just as they were enjoying the conversation, the time limit ran up. Morbius fell into a state where it could only transmit simple thoughts.When I evolve over 150 pots of these Usneas into elite-grade, I will become a D-rank spirit qi professional and be able to channel spirit qi faster. By then, I will have the capability to evolve Elite feys into Bronze ones.4Lin Yuan didn\u2019t exit from the Spirit Lock spatial zone, and instead, he placed the Jasmine Lily by the poolside in the spatial zone. Immediately after, he dug out a piece of inferior energy ore from the Jasmine Lily\u2019s pot and threw it into the pool.Lin Yuan realized that the inferior energy ore quickly vanished into the pool, and its spirit qi fused into the pool.The limpid pool gradually emitted the spirit qi into the Spirit Lock spatial zone.Originally, the Spirit Lock spatial zone didn\u2019t have any spirit qi and wasn\u2019t suitable to store fey within. However, if Lin Yuan was able to obtain a huge batch of energy ores and tossed them into the pool, it would only be a matter of time before the spirit qi within the spatial zone would be many times more concentrated as compared to the outside world.Just by putting the feys into the Spirit Lock spatial zone, the feys would be able to evolve much faster than the outside world.With concentrated spirit qi, I wonder how fast my spirit qi channeling speed would be as compared to the outside world.Naturally, everything would need to be supported with a massive amount of Federation dollars because even the lowest grade of energy ores weren\u2019t cheap.Lin Yuan previously felt that he had already earned quite a lot of Federation dollars, but it seemed like he would need much more from the looks of it now. On the path of making money, Lin Yuan still had a long road ahead.After exiting the Spirit Lock spatial zone, Lin Yuan started to evolve the Usneas.2For the next few days, apart from eating, sleeping, and conversing with Morbius for half an hour a day, Lin Yuan would be evolving the 150 pots of Usneas.6On the seventh day, which was the day agreed upon with Yang Mingkai, Lin Yuan was barely able to evolve 100 pots of Usneas to elite-grade.4At that moment, Lin Yuan felt that the spirit qi storage in his body was going to reach the next rank. After reaching the next rank, Lin Yuan\u2019s spirit qi would be able to achieve a breakthrough. It would transform his thin and gaseous spirit qi, into concentrated and misty spirit qi.By then, he would become a D-rank spirit qi professional.1During the seven days, Yang Mingkai had been handling the matters to set up the fey breeding base. Yang Mingkai had to rent the building for his fey breeding base. After all, he didn\u2019t have enough money to build a fey breeding base.When renting a fey breeding base, all of the facilities would be available for use. Presently, Yang Mingkai was just waiting for Lin Yuan to deliver the 70+ pots of Elite Usneas.2After obtaining the Elite Usneas, Yang Mingkai could start to split and breed them.Yang Mingkai might have kept Lin Yuan\u2019s phone number, but he didn\u2019t dare to call and pester him. This was a huge order, so a Creation Master must certainly be behind the scenes.He had already reached an agreement with Lin Yuan, so if he called him halfway, it would show that he didn\u2019t trust Lin Yuan. If the task wasn\u2019t completed yet, it would also give Lin Yuan pressure.Therefore, on the seventh day, Yang Mingkai hesitantly visited Lin Yuan\u2019s small store and knocked on the door.Lin Yuan opened the door and instantly dazzled Yang Mingkai with the rows of Elite Usneas. All of the Elite Usneas were emitting an aura of Federation dollars, and it made Yang Mingkai gulp down his saliva.\u201cBig Brother Yang, the Elite Usneas are all here. Back then, you said you wanted 76 pots of Usneas. You can just pick 76 pots from the 100 pots here.\u201d4When Yang Mingkai entered, he felt that the pots of Usneas were much more than what he had requested. Upon hearing that there were 100 pots, he couldn\u2019t hold back and laughed.\u201cYoung Brother, have you found any buyers for your remaining 24 pots?\u201dYang Mingkai immediately felt that he had said something wrong. How could there be no buyers for Elite Usneas?However, Yang Mingkai was really eager to purchase all 100 pots of Usneas. By then, with over 120 pots of Elite Usneas, he could simply nurture more Usneas during the early stages of his breeding base.There was always a lack of supply for Usneas, and he simply had to accumulate them slowly, allowing the snowball to roll bigger.Lin Yuan was planning to list the remaining Elite Usneas on the Star Web and set up a fey store after Yang Mingkai took the Usneas that he needed.Lin Yuan had already applied to open a fey store, and it had been approved yesterday.However, there were no goods on Lin Yuan\u2019s Star Web store now.Since Yang Mingkai wanted all 100 pots of Elite Usneas, it would save Lin Yuan the trouble of listing them on the Star Web.\u201cBig Brother Yang, if you want them, I will sell them to you at the price we agreed upon previously.\u201dYang Mingkai was overjoyed and truly appreciated Lin Yuan.Yang Mingkai already had a very good impression of Lin Yuan. If Lin Yuan showed some intention of becoming sworn brothers with him, he would immediately pull Lin Yuan and conduct the ceremony to become sworn brothers.Looking at Yang Mingkai\u2019s happy expression, Lin Yuan took another glance at the 100 pots of Elite Usneas and felt that the Creation Master occupation was truly great.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 29": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter carefully securing the 100 Usnea pots on his Crowned Fire Salamander, Yang Mingkai left immediately.In this transaction, Lin Yuan obtained 3.3 Radiance dollars, which was equivalent to 3,300,000 Federation dollars.5The money that Lin Yuan had earned previously made him understand that his ability to evolve feys was a money-making method. The 3.3 Radiance dollars made Lin Yuan realize that money was no longer an obstacle for him.What I need to do now isn\u2019t to think of how to earn more money\u2014it is how to turn this wealth into my strength.It was fine to evolve low-grade feys, but a huge amount of resources would be required when evolving them to the higher grades.Take the Spirit Lock spatial zone for example. If Lin Yuan wanted to modify it, he would need countless resources.Lin Yuan found it necessary to become a hoarder mouse that would accumulate resources frenziedly. He would then be able to experience the joy of a hoarder mouse.3After another two days, when Lin Yuan had evolved 34 pots of Usneas into elite-grade, he suddenly felt the massive amount of gaseous spirit qi in his body being compressed. It was so intensively compressed that it turned into a streak of misty spirit qi.5My streak of mist-like spirit qi is extremely concentrated right now. It feels like it will turn into liquid if it is concentrated any further. If the misty spirit qi can turn into liquid spirit qi, then I will be reaching the entrance of a C-rank spirit qi professional.Lin Yuan picked up another pot of Elite Usnea. Soon, he realized that after becoming a D-rank spirit qi professional, he didn\u2019t even need ten minutes to evolve a Normal Usnea into an Elite one. It cut down the time by at least six times.At that moment, Lin Yuan heard two gentle sounds from his body. He looked down and noticed the two sounds were actually coming from Genius and Chimey.During the past few days that he had been evolving the Usneas, Genius and Chimey would always be leaning on him. The Normal Genius and Chimey had actually broken through the limits and became Elite!Lin Yuan checked on Chimey and Genius\u2019 data and was rather surprised after reading their elite-grade abilities.[Fey Name]: Hundred Questions Beast[Fey Species]: Cat species/Intelligent Cat species[Fey Grade]: Elite (1/10)[Fey Type]: Spiritual[Fey Quality]: EliteAbilities:[Precise Memory]: When memorizing something, every single detail can be memorized with precision.[Knowledge Analysis]: Can conduct a diverse initial analysis of the memory\u2019s knowledge.Knowledge Analysis allowed Genius\u2019 memorized knowledge to go through a systematic integration. Genius could then integrate and analyze it with the existing knowledge. This was an ability that really surprised Lin Yuan.Even a high-ranked Scholar wouldn\u2019t be able to accurately memorize the information on 100 books, let alone conduct overall analysis of the details.This elite-grade ability could allow Genius to become a Sage, a walking knowledge database, and a Data Analysis Master. Lin Yuan felt that Genius now truly lived up to the name that he had given to it back then.At that moment, the evolved Genius suddenly said, \u201cYuan, I can memorize even more things now.\u201dWhile speaking, Genius was jumping around on Lin Yuan\u2019s thighs, happily tilting its little head and asking to be praised.Lin Yuan rubbed the fur on Genius\u2019 head and asked, \u201cGenius, how much can you memorize now?\u201dGenius\u2019 size didn\u2019t change after reaching elite-grade, but the silverish gray fur\u2019s surface was now thicker and had luster.Genius tilted its head and quickly replied, \u201cYuan, my memory was about one energy biscuit previously. Now, it is as many as five energy biscuits!\u201d5After hearing Genius\u2019 comparison, Lin Yuan felt a little heartache and rubbed Genius\u2019 chin.Genius immediately started purring with enjoyment.The best food that this greedy little cat had eaten before was red braised meat. Thus, it would use red braised meat to make comparisons. Now that the energy biscuits had become the best food it had eaten, Genius changed the quantity comparison from red braised meat to energy biscuits.1The increase in Genius\u2019 memory had truly shocked Lin Yuan.In the beginning, Genius had the memory storage of three to five books. After reaching normal-grade, it had gained a memory storage of 100 books. Now that it reached elite-grade, its memory capacity had increased to 500 books.4It wasn\u2019t even possible for an ordinary person to read 500 books, let alone memorize all 500 books.39Previously when Lin Yuan had asked Genius to study the books, he had needed to make a selection. Currently, he could simply ask Genius to memorize all the primary books on the Scholar, Fey Observer, and Spiritual Ingredient Analyst occupations.3In fact, he could even ask Genius to learn other knowledge in advance.Lin Yuan had already been overjoyed with the Hundred Questions Beast\u2019s evolution to normal-grade. Now that it broke through and became an Elite Hundred Questions Beast, it brought Lin Yuan a pleasant surprise again.Lin Yuan had to admit that the evolved Hundred Questions Beast was more like a perfect housekeeping beast.The dazzled Chimey, which had also evolved, woke up.[Fey Name]: Sound Bird[Fey Species]: Corvidae species/Kingfisher species2[Fey Grade]: Elite (2/10)[Fey Type]: Sound/Qi[Fey Quality]: EliteAbilities:[Sound Thrust]: Fire a sharp spike that is formed by sound at a designated target.[Turbulence]: The flap of the wings emits a consistently fast and random flow of air current.Just as Chimey was preparing to fly toward Lin Yuan\u2019s ear, it extended and wings and noticed its feathers. Chimey immediately chirped with surprise.Perhaps due to its failure to evolve into a Songstress Bird, Chimey always had a special preference toward the color of blue as all Songstress Birds had blue feathers.Presently, Chimey\u2019s feathers had already transformed from green to blue.However, Chimey\u2019s appearance was completely different from a Songstress Bird.Firstly, Chimey was still the size of half a palm, and its size didn\u2019t transform because of its progress in grade. Instead, it got even more delicate and refined. The blue feathers weren\u2019t a deep blue color like the Songstress Birds\u2014it was more like the azure sky blue in the skies of a sunny day.It was an azure blue that would attract anyone\u2019s eyes in a single glance.The azure blue feathers on Chimey had faint patterns, and their color was slightly lighter. Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t able to see anything at first and merely felt that they were like cloud patterns.2One had to look out for markings after a fey\u2019s evolution. They wouldn\u2019t develop a unique trait for no reason and disappear by the next evolution. Therefore, the specialty and function of the cloud pattern would only be clearer after reaching bronze-grade.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 30": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChimey was now absurdly exquisite. Its appearance should be in the top ranks even among the Elite avian feys.Chimey looked at its blue feathers and stared blankly for a long time before it jumped onto Lin Yuan\u2019s ear and started singing happily.Chimey\u2019s singing voice had also changed. Chimey\u2019s singing voice was at the concert hall\u2019s standard in the past. But now, its singing voice was just like the song of the legendary Thorn\u00a0Birds1.Every change of tune was like a praise toward life, the clear humming of a siren, an ode of the sun and moon in the universe.This was an ability to make use of the singing voice to the extremity.This was perhaps Chimey\u2019s unique talent as a Sound Bird, as it was the only Elite Sound Bird in history.As compared to the singing, Lin Yuan paid more attention to Chimey\u2019s type.Chimey wasn\u2019t just purely sound-type after reaching elite-grade, as it had a dual-type of sound and qi now.Lin Yuan had been rather worried that Chimey might continue down the sound-type path, and it would only make the path narrower.Now that it had evolved into the sound and qi types, it would definitely expand the spaciousness of Chimey\u2019s future path.Lin Yuan walked to the entrance and took out the wooden board that was previously used to test Chimey\u2019s attack power. He said, \u201cChimey, use the ability, Turbulence.\u201dWhen Chimey received Lin Yuan\u2019s command, it immediately flapped its wings, and a small surge of energy shot out of its small body. It produced a turbulent flow of air that expanded out of Chimey\u2019s body.Immediately after, Chimey controlled Turbulence and smashed it at the one-centimeter-thick wooden board.The wooden board let out a \u2018buzzing\u2019 sound as though something sharp was scraping it. The turbulent flow of air was constantly shrinking the size of the wooden board.When it was finally shrunk by a third of the size, the wooden board\u2019s edges were already turned into wooden shavings because of Turbulence.Chimey\u2019s elite-grade attack power was far beyond its normal-grade attack power.Lin Yuan looked at Chimey with approval and took out a metal board that was used for the racks. He walked into the courtyard and placed the metal board on the ground.\u201cChimey, use Turbulence again and attack this metal board.\u201dIt was the same as before, but the metal board was only letting out \u2018clunking\u2019 sounds after getting hit by Turbulence. There wasn\u2019t any damage.At that moment, Chimey let out a clear chirp, and a small hole was pierced open in the metal board.Turbulence then found its target and rushed toward that small hole frenziedly.The metal board was quickly ripped apart by Turbulence. By the time Turbulence ended, Lin Yuan looked at the destroyed metal board and gave Chimey a thumbs up.The combination of Sound Thrust and Turbulence was surprisingly good.Sound Thrust was just like a hidden weapon that could sneak an attack, while Turbulence was mainly for consistent damage and control effects.When Chimey executed Turbulence, it would first flow around Chimey\u2019s body, which also allowed to be used as a method of defense. It could help Chimey to block attacks that it couldn\u2019t dodge in time.After getting praised by Lin Yuan, it flew around the courtyard happily before landing on Genius\u2019 head and hopping around. It looked as though it was telling Genius how great it was.Genius\u2019 and Chimey\u2019s evolutions had given Lin Yuan more confidence.All of a sudden, Lin Yuan recalled something and said silently, \u201cNot good!\u201dFor this entire time, he had totally forgotten about the two Web-Spraying Spiders. The two Web-Spraying Spiders should still be alive, right!?Lin Yuan rushed back into the house, opened up the two elite-grade spirit storage boxes, and found them lying there motionlessly.Lin Yuan had the thought to heal a dead horse as though it was still a living\u00a0horse1. He placed one hand on each of the Web-Spraying Spiders and transferred the spirit qi.A few minutes later, the two Web-Spraying Spiders moved their legs slightly. Lin Yuan was finally relieved to see that they weren\u2019t dead.However, if he was another moment late, they might have perished.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t in a hurry to evolve the grade of the two Web-Spraying Spiders. Instead, he cut off a few of the Elite Usneas\u2019 vines and fed them to the Web-Spraying Spiders.The Web-Spraying Spiders were omnivorous. They might not enjoy eating Usnea vines, but the rich nutrients in them were definitely the best for replenishing the Web-Spraying Spiders\u2019 stamina.The two Web-Spraying Spiders ate five Usnea vines before recovering their strength. When they recovered, Lin Yuan started to evolve them from Elite X/Flawless to Bronze/Normal.Lin Yuan was planning to evolve them to bronze-grade before putting them on the Star Web for sale. He wasn\u2019t planning to increase their quality to Epic.Even if they evolved with epic-quality, they would merely be able to choose a better exclusive skill after reaching bronze-grade. However, the time and cost invested wouldn\u2019t be proportionate.Normally, a Creation Master would only push an Elite fey\u2019s quality to Epic when it was a custom order.After reaching epic-quality, the customer would bring back the fey and gamble on whether any of the three exclusive skills was what they wanted.Even if an Elite fey\u2019s quality was Epic when they reached bronze-grade, there might not be an incredible exclusive skill among the three exclusive skills.As compared to feys reaching bronze-grade with flawless-quality, the chances were merely three times better.Two hours later, the two Web-Spraying Spiders let out terrifying roars before evolving to bronze-grade. They took on an entirely different appearance as compared to before.One of the Web-Spraying Spiders\u2019 hind legs grew longer, and its abdomen grew bigger. The two hind legs that grew longer were also known as the weaving legs. This Web-Spraying Spider\u2019s evolution direction was toward spirituality variant. Its size didn\u2019t become bigger, but the ability to spray and weave webs became better. The exclusive skill was Adhesive Spider Web. It enhanced the spider web\u2019s adhesiveness and gave a better control ability.The other Web-Spraying Spider\u2019s size grew by two times, and its originally brownish yellow color had some faint green colors. The evolution direction was obviously toward the ancestry line. This Web-Spraying Spider awakened the exclusive skill, Violent Venom. It gave a strong venom to the body and also the spider webs. It was a rather good exclusive skill, and even though it didn\u2019t increase the control power, it increased the poison-type\u2019s lethality.Lin Yuan nodded with satisfaction as these two Web-Spraying Spiders should be able to sell for a good price on the Star Web. The exclusive skills of these two Web-Spraying Spiders might not be top-notch, but they were above average.Lin Yuan managed to evolve two similar Web-Spraying Spiders to bronze-grade. He finally understood why people would say that the diversification of attributes would increase after reaching bronze-grade.A different evolution direction and a different exclusive skill would create a significant difference between the same feys.Such diversifications during evolutions made Lin Yuan feel that the evolution of feys was a cool process. It felt like the creation and innovation of life.The evolutions of the two Web-Spraying Spiders made Lin Yuan experience and understand the significance of life.The sunlight from outside the window came inside the small fey store and shone on Lin Yuan\u2019s face. It plated Lin Yuan\u2019s body with a layer of warm light.The ray of light on Lin Yuan made the two newly evolved Web-Spraying Spiders feel that it was the dawn.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, in the eyes of the two Web-Spraying Spiders, this faint light of dawn was the redemption of life.The hands that were placed on their backs were constantly channeling spirit qi and pulling them back from the doors of hell.However, the Web-Spraying Spiders didn\u2019t know that the dawn in their eyes would soon sell them on the Star Web store.In fact, when Creation Masters evolved feys and sold them, it was to search for a new contractor for the feys.Spirit qi professionals and feys would always mutually benefit from each other.Spirit qi professionals would think of all methods to nurture their feys. When the feys were stronger, they would be able to enhance the spirit qi professionals\u2019 combat capabilities.Lin Yuan had already used the Star Web Card to log into the Star Web. Lin Yuan always liked to visit those fey websites to acquire more knowledge on how to nurture feys.For websites like fey ones, they were still maintained in the same appearance before the Spirit Qi Awakening. The Star Web was different as it was the same as a second world for humans.By using the Star Web Card to enter the Star Web, it was just like entering a brand new world of network.Lin Yuan seldom visited the Star Web, so his Star Web account didn\u2019t have anything else apart from his name, age, and basic information of his identity.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t immediately fill up all the personal information, like his spirit qi rank, contracted feys, or interests and hobbies. Instead, he entered the Star Web store that he had applied for and just gotten approved.In order to apply for the store, the application fee had cost Lin Yuan 100,000 Federation dollars, and he felt the pinch.The store didn\u2019t have a name yet, so Lin Yuan conveniently changed the store\u2019s name to Purchase With No Loss Fey Store.After changing the name, Lin Yuan immediately confirmed it with convenient procedures. Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but nod with satisfaction.Lin Yuan still remembered an advertisement in his previous life. \u201cPurchase with no loss, purchase with no fraud, to see the items that are truly worth the price, enter the house to take a look.\u201dNow that my store is called Purchase With No Loss Fey Store, the name immediately demonstrates this store\u2019s conscience and sincerity. Awesome!Genius was seated on Lin Yuan\u2019s thighs and looking at Lin Yuan while tilting its head.Genius didn\u2019t know why the radiant smile on Lin Yuan\u2019s face made him look like a silly kid.A newly approved Star Web store was still a Class 1 Star Web store. It might be a Class 1 one, but the size of the store wasn\u2019t small.Lin Yuan might feel the pinch after spending 100,000 Federation dollars, but he was feeling a little better now.Lin Yuan\u2019s actual fey store was only around 80 square meters, including both the first and second floors. But this store on the Star Web was at least 200 square meters, and it was already two times as big.In the Star Web, a Class 1 store that was newly approved would be an empty house with a standard size of 200 square meters. Lin Yuan\u2019s current store was nothing but an empty shell apart from the four clear and white walls. In order to decorate the store, he would need to purchase the decorations in the Star Web.The Star Web was a world that was entirely made up of data, but these data really existed.Lin Yuan used the Star Web Card to scan the Elite Usneas and the two Web-Spraying Spiders into data before listing them onto the store to sell.The Elite Usneas and the two Web-Spraying Spiders were turned into data, and their virtual images appeared in Lin Yuan\u2019s store.In terms of appearance, they were entirely the same when they were in the actual world. Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but lament at how amazing the Star Web was.At that moment, the Star Web notified and asked Lin Yuan if he wished to change his Star Web account\u2019s name.If he didn\u2019t change it, the default name of the store owner should be the actual name.Lin Yuan immediately cursed in his heart.\u00a0Isn\u2019t the Star Web account name the same as a web name?Lin Yuan immediately changed his name into Deep Mountain Elder Lin.The name Deep Mountain Elder Lin was actually the meaning of his actual name, Lin\u00a0Yuan1.In the virtual world, it was better to change one\u2019s name when setting up a store.Lin Yuan\u2019s store had just opened, so he didn\u2019t think that anyone would be coming in soon. Therefore, he looked for a bookstore in the Star Web Community.When walking into the Star Web Community, Lin Yuan had his eyes opened.As he was in the Star Web, apart from some special decorations, most of them were real scanned items.Inside the community, one could see high-ranked spirit qi professionals riding all sorts of feys and inviting eyes of envy.It was very rare to see Bronze feys and above in the Xia Region, but in the Star Web Community, Lin Yuan could already see several Silver feys.He could even see the figures of Gold feys occasionally.Spirit qi professionals who possessed Gold feys would normally be B-rank.B-rank spirit qi professionals were considered the core strength of the Radiance Federation.Lin Yuan walked into a book store and noticed there weren\u2019t any owners. The storekeeper was an AI robot.AI robots were sold on the Star Web. Those with lesser functions would be around 40,000 Federation dollars. Those with better functions would be around 80,000 Federation dollars.They had a warranty of five years.After some calculations, the robots with lesser functions would be around 8,000 Federation dollars per year and around 600 Federation dollars per month.Those with better functions would be around 16,000 Federation dollars per year and around 1,300 federation dollars per month. It was considered to be very affordable.AI robots could only handle simple jobs. For bookstores where the items\u2019 prices were fixed, an AI robot could easily fill in the role.For fey stores, like spiritual ingredient stores that required communication with customers to conduct business, the AI robots wouldn\u2019t be sufficient. In that case, one could hire a storekeeper from the Star Web, but the price would be several times more expensive than AI robots.There were plenty of people who could take up part-time jobs in the Star Web or even full-time jobs.However, hiring a storekeeper had its pros and cons. There were certain aspects when a storekeeper wasn\u2019t as reliable as an AI robot.The robot assisted Lin Yuan, and he quickly purchased all the books he required.After the purchase, Lin Yuan had to sign a confidentiality contract and promise that the purchased books wouldn\u2019t be given to others apart from direct relatives.After the Spirit Qi Awakening, all knowledge, even the low-ranked occupation knowledge, would need to be purchased. In addition, a confidentiality contract must be signed after the purchase.Lin Yuan involuntarily sighed.\u00a0No matter the time and place, the saying of \u2018Knowledge is wealth\u2019 remains unchanged.There were a total of 327 books that were tested for primary Scholars, Fey Observers, and Spiritual Ingredient Analysts. Lin Yuan purchased all of them.After making the purchase, Lin Yuan just had to wait for Ostrich Logistics to deliver the 327 books\u2019 information chips. He could then allow Genius to memorize the contents of the books.By then, I can go participate in the Creation Master exam.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 32": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayEarlier on, when Lin Yuan had entered the bookstore, he had felt that the renovations were rather classical and stylish. While thinking of his own store, Lin Yuan headed to the Star Web\u2019s furniture and decoration store.After visiting a few furniture and decoration stores, Lin Yuan made a firm decision not to buy any furniture. This furniture and decoration store sold items that were at least ten times more expensive than the other stores.He took a look at a white wooden chair that had a price of 5,500 Federation dollars.1Lin Yuan decided not to buy anything. He felt that his little store just had to sell things, while furniture and decorations weren\u2019t necessary.However, Lin Yuan still planned to purchase an AI robot for automatic selling. The selling price for Elite Usneas and similar feys were all fixed, and Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t planning to give any chance for negotiations. It was better to set a fixed selling price.As for other superior feys, when Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t in the store, those interested parties could just leave a message with the AI robot. When Lin Yuan came online, they could then converse.AI robots might not be great, but the store was only starting, and Lin Yuan could easily handle the business. Furthermore, hiring a reliable storekeeper wasn\u2019t an easy task, and it was dependent on fate.Lin Yuan returned to his store, and just as he was preparing to purchase an AI robot, he realized there was a customer in the store.There was a young girl wearing denim clothes but wearing a bumblebee hat. She was bending over and carefully observing the two Web-Spraying Spiders in the store.2She would look at one of them and switch over to the other from time to time. She was pursing her lips as though she wasn\u2019t satisfied.Since there was business, Lin Yuan quickly went over and asked, \u201cI wonder if you fancy any of the two Web-Spraying Spiders?\u201dIt was unknown when this girl had arrived, but it seemed like she had been waiting for some time.After hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s question, she said to Lin Yuan, \u201cAre you the store owner? Your store actually doesn\u2019t even have an AI robot! I could only wait here foolishly, not knowing when you would return!\u201dLin Yuan let out an apologetic smile and said, \u201cMy small store just opened today. I didn\u2019t have time to prepare an AI robot.\u201dThe girl looked as though she understood and said, \u201cNo wonder. I have been looking for a store that is selling Bronze spider feys recently, but I only found your store today. For a silly store name like Purchase With No Loss, if I saw it previously, it would be impossible for me not to enter.\u201d2Lin Yuan\u2019s smile immediately froze and couldn\u2019t help twitching.While looking at this bumblebee-hat-wearing girl, who was around his younger sister\u2019s age, why did he feel that this unruly child was asking for a beating?1She must have done too little homework\u2026The girl felt that she had said something wrong, so she stuck out her tongue and said, \u201cUncle, what is the price for these two spiders? Don\u2019t set a price that is too expensive! Your store\u2019s name is called Purchase With No Loss!\u201d1Lin Yuan was normally addressed as Young Brother and Little Brother. This was actually the first time he was addressed as an Uncle. However, thinking that this was the store\u2019s first customer and he must provide a smiling service, he endured and said, \u201cThe smaller Web-Spraying Spider with long weaving legs awakened the exclusive skill, Adhesive Spider Web. The bigger greenish Web-Spraying Spider awakened the exclusive skill, Violent Venom.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan said Violent Venom, the young girl let out an \u2018ahhh\u2019 and consciously moved back.Without anything to lean back on, the girl immediately sat her buttocks on the ground. It just so happened that her bumblebee hat dropped down.Lin Yuan subconsciously wanted to help and pull up the girl, but when he saw the top of the girl\u2019s head, he immediately slipped out the words, \u201cBraised egg!\u201d1\u201cAHHH!\u201dAs compared to her fall earlier, she shouted even louder.The girl immediately picked up the bumblebee hat and wore it on her head. After wearing it tightly, she said, \u201cThis is an injury by a Ghost Shadow Bristled Spider and the aftereffects of the treatment. It will be fine after a few months, and it is not some braised egg!\u201d2When looking at the girl\u2019s angry expression, Lin Yuan involuntarily rubbed the back of his head. He was rather apologetic, but he silently thought in his mind,\u00a0I really didn\u2019t mean it when I exclaimed \u2018braised egg\u2019. But all the irritation after being told that the store\u2019s name is silly and being addressed as an uncle has been wiped out.4After hearing the Ghost Shadow Bristled Spider\u2019s mention, Lin Yuan felt that he had heard of someone being bitten by a Ghost Shadow Bristled\u00a0Spider1, but he couldn\u2019t remember.3Since this girl had received treatment even after getting stung by a Ghost Shadow Bristled Spider, it meant a Healer with a Gold healing-type fey had treated her as soon as she had been stung.The girl turned around and ignored Lin Yuan as she continued to observe the two Bronze Web-Spraying Spiders.Lin Yuan saw the situation and immediately asked, \u201cDo you like spider feys?\u201dThe girl responded by jumping up as though she was stung on her injured spot again. \u201cI hate spider feys the most. Who would like a big and hairy bug?\u201dWhile speaking, the girl\u2019s mouth sunk down as she added another statement, \u201cBut my innate compatibility range is pointing toward spider feys.\u201dLin Yuan first felt that it was rather comical that a person who hated spider feys was actually compatible with them.Immediately after, Lin Yuan was shocked by this girl\u2019s innate talent.Spider feys were also considered arachnids, and it was a classification that was extremely diverse among insects.1Most of the combat-class feys would have the shadows of an arachnid.If this girl was compatible with spider-species, it meant that she had plenty of choices when contracting a fey and her direction of development was very extensive.After taking a closer look at the two Web-Spraying Spiders, the girl shook her head and said to Lin Yuan, \u201cThis won\u2019t do. I want to contract with a spider fey that has a strong control ability. The exclusive skills of these two Web-Spraying Spiders are still a little weak. It will be best if I can order Elite/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders. I will surely roll out the exclusive skill, Transparent Spider Web!\u201dAfter hearing the girl\u2019s words, Lin Yuan clicked his tongue silently.The Transparent Spider Web was an extremely rare exclusive skill. It was a skill that wasn\u2019t good when used by itself, but it might produce an unexpected result when used in combination with other feys.However, in order to roll for a specific skill, it wasn\u2019t possible with just one or two epic-quality Web-Spraying Spiders. If one didn\u2019t have good luck, it might need up to around 10 or 20 spiders.2Just as the girl was walking outside, Lin Yuan pondered for a moment before speaking. \u201cDo you wish to make custom orders for epic-quality Web-Spraying Spiders? I have a method! How many do you need?\u201d2The girl immediately turned around and looked at Lin Yuan warily and said, \u201cUncle, do you think I am innocent, cute, and easy to deceive? Or do you think you look good, and I will believe you?\u201d2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 33": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlaySame-species feys, even if they were Elite/Epic ones, their price would be more than two times higher than a Bronze fey.To Lin Yuan, evolving an Elite fey\u2019s quality to Epic would require much more time than evolving an Elite/Flawless fey to Bronze/Normal.No regular Creation Master could achieve pushing an Elite fey\u2019s quality to Epic. At least, it was impossible for Rank 1 Creation Masters.Lin Yuan looked at the girl with the braised-egged head with an annoyed expression and shook his hand. \u201cHurry up and leave! Go to the other shops and take a look. You might find a Web-Spraying Spider that you want.\u201dLin Yuan had already turned around and was preparing to purchase an AI robot, but he was held back by the girl.The girl blinked her big eyes, and when her bumblebee hat was swaying around, it did look like a little bumblebee. \u201cUncle, why don\u2019t we add each other as Star Web friends?\u201dLin Yuan looked at the girl with the braised-egged head and said, \u201cThere isn\u2019t a need. If you wish to buy something from the store, you can just come back.\u201d\u201cUncle, you aren\u2019t angry, right? Take a look at your store. It doesn\u2019t have a single piece of furniture and decoration. I have already been deceived so much that I am afraid. It is fine to occasionally be wary, right!?\u201dUpon looking at the girl\u2019s crafty eyes, Lin Yuan cursed in his heart,\u00a0You would get deceived? It will be good enough if you don\u2019t go and deceive others!However, this time, Lin Yuan directly handed his Star Web name card to the girl. The girl also directly handed her Star Web name card to Lin Yuan in return.When Lin Yuan was looking at the girl\u2019s name card, he heard a burst of laughter from the side. \u201cHahaha, Deep Mountain Elder Lin! What a silly name!\u201dLin Yuan read the name on the girl\u2019s Star Web name card\u2014it was Stream in the Cloud.\u201cIsn\u2019t the Shark\u00a0Eagle1\u00a0a fish that lives inside the stream in the cloud?\u201d\u201cWhat? You actually say I am a fool!?\u201d\u201cNo! I said Stream in the Cloud.\u201d\u201cNo, I just heard you saying that I am a fool.\u201dIn the end, Lin Yuan signed a contract with the girl, who had the Star Web name Stream in the Cloud.Stream in the Cloud would pay 2 Radiance dollars for each Elite/Epic Web-Spraying Spider. She then immediately put down an order for five of them.2While signing the contract, Lin Yuan watched the girl swipe the Star Web Card without hesitation, causing him to lament in his heart.\u00a0Wealth truly gives a person confidence.When signing a contract on the Star Web to order feys, there wasn\u2019t any deposit, as it had to be paid in full.Therefore, Stream in the Cloud didn\u2019t hesitate and immediately paid the cost of 10 Radiance dollars.Of course, if Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t able to prepare the feys stated on the contract, then he would need to pay the penalty fee. At the same time, the credibility of Purchase With No Loss Fey Store would drop greatly.A store with low credibility would naturally have bad business. When the credibility fell to a certain extent, the store might have its rights taken away.After sending off Stream in the Cloud, Lin Yuan purchased an AI robot that had a better function. Once he set the Elite/Elite Usneas\u2019 price, Lin Yuan went out to visit other fey stores.He would need to purchase five Elite Web-Spraying Spiders. The best option was to purchase Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders. Lin Yuan would only have to evolve them to epic-quality afterward.Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders weren\u2019t considered rare. Therefore, Lin Yuan got them easily for around 200,000 Federation dollars each. It cost Lin Yuan a total of 1 Radiance dollar for these five Web-Spraying Spiders.2The books, AI robot, and the five Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders immediately reduced half of the funds on his hand.He didn\u2019t even have time to warm up the 3.3 Radiance dollars that he had just earned this morning and had already spent them.2Presently, Lin Yuan was only left with 2.4 Radiance dollars. He couldn\u2019t help but sigh. \u201cMoney is something that will be used up so quickly!\u201dSince Lin Yuan had purchased the five Elite/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders, he searched for Star Web stores. This time, he was very serious and careful with his selection.Lin Yuan was looking for an Elite fey to use Morbius\u2019 Spirit Lock on. Only after evolving both the spirit-locked Normal and Elite feys to Bronze, Morbius would then be able to reach bronze-grade too.Lin Yuan already had a plan for the Elite fey to use Spirit Lock on. However, the choice was truly a challenge for Lin Yuan. He had chosen a support-type fey that no one would basically choose\u2014the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.No one picked the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, not because it didn\u2019t have a good ability. On the contrary, the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s basic ability was one of the most popular abilities among the support-type feys, Spirit Injection.Spirit Injection allowed the spirit qi professionals to quickly replenish their used up spirit qi in battle.The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish had such a favorable basic ability, but no one would pick it because it would only absorb pure spirit qi. It would reject most of the spirit qi produced by spiritual ingredients.Furthermore, the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish required a huge amount of spirit qi in order to evolve. It would need 10 times more spirit qi than other feys of the same grade.These factors made the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish a fey that Creation Masters didn\u2019t like.Due to the difficulty of evolving it, no one would pick the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish as their own contracted fey.Even though the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish wasn\u2019t a great choice, its price wasn\u2019t low at all. When a Spirit-Siphon Goldfish swam, it would release spirit qi into the environment.The higher the grade of the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, the more spirit qi would be released. This made the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish become a superior fey that could support spirit qi professionals to absorb spirit qi.There were plenty of stores on the Star Web selling Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, but most of them would be selling Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. There were basically no stores selling Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.2Lin Yuan finally chose a Class 3 store as it didn\u2019t just have Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, but it also sold spiritual ingredients.It just so happened that Lin Yuan could purchase all the things he needed in this store.After entering the Class 3 store, Lin Yuan realized its size wasn\u2019t just big, it was close to 800 square meters!After taking a glance, there were all sorts of spiritual ingredients and feys that were arranged neatly and orderly in the store. It made this 800 square meter store a little congested.At that moment, Lin Yuan heard a gentle female voice that echoed beside his ear. \u201cLet me bring you to what you want to buy. My staff members have the day off today, so please forgive me for any mistakes.\u201dThe woman let out a friendly smile while speaking, and subtly built a closer relationship.Lin Yuan went straight to the point and said, \u201cBoss, I wish to buy a Spirit-Siphon Goldfish from here.\u201d\u201cThis way, please.\u201dThe middle-aged lady led the way at the front and swiftly brought Lin Yuan to a pond that was around six to seven square meters in size. The pond had Spirit-Siphon Goldfish that were in all sorts of colors, and they were swimming around smoothly and quickly.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 34": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWhen Lin Yuan approached the pond, he felt that the spirit qi was much more concentrated.1The middle-aged lady pointed at the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish inside the pond and said, \u201cThe smaller ones in the pond are all normal-grade. That reddish goldfish, which is twice as big as the other Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, is elite-grade.\u201dLin Yuan asked curiously, \u201cBoss, what are the prices for Normal and Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, respectively?\u201dThe middle-aged lady chuckled and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep calling me Boss. I should only be slightly older than you. Just call me Big Sister Xin.\u201cNormal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, regardless of subspecies, cost 0.5 Radiance dollar each. The Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish costs 5 Radiance dollars.\u201d18Lin Yuan already knew that the Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish would be expensive, but after hearing it cost 5 Radiance dollars, he couldn\u2019t help but be surprised.Zhou Jiaxin noticed Lin Yuan\u2019s surprised expression and explained, \u201cI have already quoted a very reasonable price for the Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, and that is due to its poor subspecies. If it was a superior subspecies, the price would be at least 7 Radiance dollars. The other places sell Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish of different subspecies with different prices too. But at my place, I sell them for the same price. Most of the time, people would pick them based on their looks. Not many Creation Masters are willing to take the task of evolving these feys.\u201dLin Yuan nodded in response.The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was actually the commonly-called goldfish before the Spirit Qi Awakening. The Telescope, Ranchu, Lionchu, Ryukin, Butterfly Telescope, and so on were all subspecies of the goldfish, and they were all called Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.The different subspecies of Spirit-Siphon Goldfish didn\u2019t have a great difference at normal-grade and elite-grade, but their evolution direction would be different after reaching bronze-grade.For this time, Lin Yuan wanted to purchase a Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. It was said that if the Telescope subspecies evolved toward the ancestry line, it might activate the thin dragon-species bloodline.That would be the same as jumping through the dragon gate. However, the possibility of it happening was minute.2Previously, a high-ranked Creation Master had nurtured a Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to bronze-grade, and it had evolved toward the ancestry line, awakening the dragon-species bloodline.The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish that had awakened the dragon-species bloodline had immediately been placed in the Star Web\u2019s Rare Lifeform Pavilion for an auction and sold for an astronomical price.Lin Yuan wanted to attempt and see if he could activate the dragon-species bloodline within the Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish at bronze-grade. In fact, even if he couldn\u2019t activate the bloodline, it wouldn\u2019t be bad either. The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s basic ability was already incredible enough.Lin Yuan wanted to purchase a Spirit-Siphon Goldfish and experiment to see how long he would need to evolve it. He would then see if the Spirit Lock spatial zone, which had concentrated spirit qi, could allow the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to evolve at a speed that was several times faster.1If his Spirit Lock spatial zone was able to evolve the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish faster, then his store could focus on selling Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. Such a store would have a reputation that would spread swiftly.Of course, all of this would have to wait until Lin Yuan finished the order for the five Web-Spraying Spiders.After all, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have enough capital to purchase Spirit-Siphon Goldfish right now.Lin Yuan picked a black and healthy Normal I/Normal Telescope Goldfish from the pond. He was planning to purchase some energy ores with the rest of the money to enhance and check the limits of the spirit qi concentration in his Spirit Lock spatial zone.Lin Yuan purchased the inferior energy ores from Zhou Jiaxin at the price of 500 Federation dollars for each catty. He purchased a total of 2,000 catties, leaving him with just 0.9 Radiance dollars.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t spare the 0.9 Radiance dollars either and purchased some Butterfly Shells.The Butterfly Shell Beast was a kind of deep-sea fey, and Butterfly Shells were made by polishing and grinding the Butterfly Shell Beast\u2019s shell. There were all sorts of patterns and shapes.The Butterfly Shell Beast had plenty of different colored shells, which didn\u2019t have a big difference in price.Lin Yuan chose the yellow ginkgo-leaf-shaped Butterfly Shells. After delicate polishing and grinding, the Butterfly Shell was shining with pearl-like luster.1These Butterfly Shells were mainly used as fodder for the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. As spiritual ingredients, the Butterfly Shells had a slight effect of awakening a water-type fey\u2019s bloodline.Also, when these golden-yellow ginkgo-leaf-shaped Butterfly Shells were placed at the bottom of the Spirit Lock spatial zone\u2019s pool, they gave off a serene deep autumn scenery. It was spectacular.2Lin Yuan spent his 0.9 Radiance dollars and bought a bunch of Butterfly Shells. There were roughly over 100 Butterfly Shells, and they should be enough to feed the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish for three to five months.Lin Yuan hoped that the Spirit Lock spatial zone could enhance the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s growth. It wasn\u2019t difficult for him to increase the grade of the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish because he could purify the spirit qi in the air before channeling it into the fey\u2019s body. This method would allow a fey to absorb the spirit qi directly, so the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish wouldn\u2019t reject it.The time required to evolve a Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was actually ten times longer than other feys. Evolving the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was actually not good for him. When evolving feys, Lin Yuan also wanted to increase his strength. He didn\u2019t wish to nurture the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish and not be able to increase the speed of spirit qi absorption.Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t expect her store to suddenly receive such a huge order. Therefore, she asked Lin Yuan, \u201cYou are purchasing so many inferior energy ores to nurture a huge number of low-grade feys, right?\u201dLin Yuan didn\u2019t nod or shake his head. He smiled and said, \u201cBig Sister Xin, I require quite a bit of energy ores for my daily operations.\u201d1Zhou Jiaxin looked at Lin Yuan, feeling that he was emitting a plant\u2019s refreshing presence after rain and made her feel indescribably closer.2Zhou Jiaxin immediately sent a request to add Lin Yuan\u2019s Star Web account.\u201cLet\u2019s add each other to the friend list. If you need anything else next time, you just have to tell me directly. If the store doesn\u2019t have the spiritual ingredient, I can help you to get them with the proper price.\u201dLin Yuan gladly agreed. Most of the spiritual ingredient stores would sell mostly low-grade or mid-grade goods. Even if the store owner had high-grade spiritual ingredients, it wouldn\u2019t be displayed in the store.All spirit qi professionals would think of all methods to evolve feys, so some of the rarer spiritual ingredients would never have sufficient supply.After adding Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s Star Web account, it would save Lin Yuan plenty of trouble. If he needed anything, he would just make a direct order.This Class 3 store\u2019s spiritual ingredients might not be the cheapest, but their quality was all of a certain standard.\u201cI might have to purchase more energy ores and Butterfly Shells from Big Sister Xin next time. I might even purchase a few more Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.\u201d\u201cWill you still need the same inferior energy ores next time?\u201dLin Yuan nodded. The higher the grade of the energy ores, the purer the spirit qi contained within. It would be easier to channel the spirit qi out of the energy ores for the feys to absorb.However, the Spirit Lock spatial zone\u2019s spirit pool could dissolve the inferior energy ores into spirit qi. Since that was the case, inferior energy ores were naturally more worth it.Zhou Jiaxin noted it down but was rather surprised in her heart. Inferior energy ores could only be used to nurture Normal and Elite feys. How big must the fey breeding base be to need such a huge amount of low-grade energy ores?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 35": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIf it was really a large-scale fey breeding base, then it would certainly require a significant amount of spiritual ingredients.If I can secure this customer, I will have an additional steady flow of orders.While thinking like that, Zhou Jiaxin spoke to Lin Yuan eagerly. \u201cAs long as you tell me in advance, I will be able to prepare the goods in half an hour. Ostrich Logistics will deliver it to your place within a few hours. That\u2019s right! If you have any good feys, you can sell them to me too. Or you can also purchase some severely injured feys from me. Those feys are still alive, and I can guarantee the freshness of the spiritual ingredients.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan heard the words \u2018severely injured\u2019, his eyes lit up.\u00a0Doesn\u2019t this mean that I have a chance to pick up great hidden goods again?1Lin Yuan didn\u2019t plan to sell feys to Zhou Jiaxin, as he was going to use the superior feys to increase his store\u2019s reputation.When Zhou Jiaxin saw Lin Yuan\u2019s shining eyes, she couldn\u2019t help smiling. \u201cToday is the 6th of September. On the 27th of September, there will be a batch of severely injured feys arriving in the store. By then, you can come over to take a look. Those feys have all been vetted by a Class 2 Creation Master, and the Class 2 Creation Master couldn\u2019t save them. It is basically impossible for them to recover.\u201d2Zhou Jiaxin spoke very clearly and was trying to dismiss Lin Yuan\u2019s thought of finding some great feys that were missed out. Lin Yuan understood Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s intention too.A Class 2 Creation Master might not be able to heal the injured feys, but it doesn\u2019t mean that I cannot heal them.1For Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store, even if the fey was severely injured, it shouldn\u2019t be any higher than gold-grade and would at least be a Silver fey.To heal such feys, a Class 3 Creation Master would need to be hired, and the price was already higher than Silver feys.Therefore, when Class 2 Creation Masters couldn\u2019t heal such feys, they were basically sentenced to death.1The Class 2 Creation Master would use simple methods to maintain the feys\u2019 lives to guarantee the freshness of the spiritual ingredients.Instead of saying that Zhou Jiaxin was selling severely injured feys, it would be better to say she was selling extremely fresh spiritual ingredients.Lin Yuan was currently a D-rank spirit qi professional, and he wasn\u2019t confident in healing a severely injured Silver fey immediately. However, he was certain that the channeling of spirit qi would constantly make the Silver fey better. After a period of time, it would be possible to heal it.\u201cThen, I shall revisit the store on the 27th. Big Sister Xin, I have been here for quite some time now. Why don\u2019t I see any customers coming into the store?\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s question didn\u2019t have any meaning to hint that Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store had a lack of customers. It was a genuine question.For a Class 3 store that had great credibility, it should be constantly filled with customers. Thus, why was it so quiet today?Zhou Jiaxin pointed at the poster on the wall of her store and said, \u201cThere is a tournament at the Starry Tower\u2019s Brilliance Celestial Stairway. It just so happens that two Sequence members are dueling. Everyone went to watch the duel. My staff members requested for half a day off to watch the duel too.\u201dZhou Jiaxin saw Lin Yuan blinking his eyes and didn\u2019t think that there was someone who didn\u2019t know of such a huge event in the Star Web.Sequence member?The only known Sequence in the Radiance Federation was the Radiance Hundred. The rankings of the Radiance Hundred were in sequence from 1 to 100.The Radiance Hundred Sequence members were the young generation of the federation, and most of them had an age gap that wasn\u2019t more than 10 years.Every year, ten of the Hundred Sequence members would retire, and ten new members would fill the ranks.There were two types of scenarios when the Radiance Hundred were retired. The first type was if their rankings were from the 91st to the 100th. They would be automatically eliminated from the Radiance Hundred Sequence, and new members would replace them.The other type was when they remained in the Radiance Hundred for ten years and would retire with glory. This method of retirement was filled with honor.This would definitely increase the competitive spirit between the Radiance Hundred Sequence.No matter when or how intense the competition was, the Radiance Hundred would be the most dazzling stars in the Radiance Federation\u2019s young generation. At the same time, they would also develop into the Radiance Federation\u2019s new pillars.It was unexpected for two Sequence members to actually duel with each other in the Starry Tower\u2019s Brilliance Celestial Stairway.No wonder the Star Web\u2019s streets are empty. Everyone has gone to watch the duel between the Sequence members.Lin Yuan immediately settled the bill, and he took 4,000 Federation dollars out of his remaining 90,000 to purchase a ticket.4However, after purchasing the ticket, Lin Yuan realized that the duel had already started for nearly ten minutes. A duel between two Sequence members on the Brilliance Celestial Stairway was rather rare, especially when these two Sequence members were individuals with great popularity.That\u2019s why this duel had already gone through a large scale advertising on the Star Web for a long time.Both the indoor and outdoor tickets had already been sold out, so Lin Yuan hat to spend 4,000 Federation dollars to purchase a tall-platform ticket.3There was no limit to the sale of tall-platform tickets, so anyone who wanted the duel could purchase them and stand on the tall platform to watch.However, the view was utterly inferior to the outdoor tickets, let alone the indoor tickets.Star Web, Celestial Stairway Duel Ground, tall platform\u2026Inside the Celestial Stairway Duel Ground, cheers and yells constantly echoed, creating a vibrant atmosphere.When the passionate soundwaves hit the tall platform, Lin Yuan got a shock.Lin Yuan looked around the tall platform and saw a bumblebee hat from afar. Its owner\u2019s head was shaking as she watched the duel.It seemed like Stream in the Cloud had immediately come here to watch the duel after leaving his store.There was still an empty space beside the girl. Lin Yuan walked over and heard her yelling loudly, \u201cWhite Devil Lordress, do your best! Unknown Flame Lordress, you will surely win!\u201d3When Lin Yuan heard Stream in the Cloud\u2019s passionate cheers, he didn\u2019t feel anything at first. But after listening to the entire cheer, he looked at the excited Stream in the Cloud in astonishment. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cWho exactly are you cheering for? This is the first time I see someone cheering for both sides in a duel!\u201dStream in the Cloud heard someone teasing her and turned around to see that it was Lin Yuan. When she noticed it was a familiar person, she revealed a smile, but it was immediately followed by a \u2018mind your own business\u2019 look.\u201cDeep Mountain Elder Lin, both White Devil Lordress and Unknown Flame Lordress are my idols. I will be happy no matter who wins!\u201dIt seemed like Stream in the Cloud was a fanatical follower.The clamor from the live venue was filled with plenty of people doing their best to yell and cheer. The atmosphere had already affected Lin Yuan and caused a blood-boiling feeling.\u201cDeep Mountain Elder Lin, who do you support more? White Devil Lordress or Unknown Flame Lordress?\u201d Stream in the Cloud looked at Lin Yuan with curiosity.Lin Yuan was startled by the question. Before this, he had been a busy person who barely managed to survive by struggling. His weak spiritual energy would make him dizzy after a short browse of the old-modeled mobile phone. Therefore, Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t very familiar with these two Sequence members and naturally didn\u2019t know who to support.3Individuals who could enter the Radiance Hundred Sequence were all future guardians of the Radiance Federation.Lin Yuan said, \u201cI support both of them just like you.\u201d1Stream in the Cloud\u2019s eyes lit up. Under such circumstances, supporters of the same side would definitely have a closer relationship. As such, Stream in the Cloud suddenly initiated the conversation and continuously talked to Lin Yuan.2\u201cWhite Devil Lordress might be Sequence #18 while Unknown Flame Lordress is Sequence #47, but I feel that Unknown Flame Lordress has a better chance to win. Unknown Flame Lordress is a power offense-type spirit qi professional, while White Devil Lordress is a healing-type spirit qi professional.\u201d2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even though, Sequence $18, White Devil was a Healer without many attack methods.3Lin Yuan took a closer look at the battleground and could see that White Devil was a young lady in long white robes and had graceful black hair.At that moment, she was standing there calmly and holding a long scepter.At the front end of the scepter was a birdcage, but it didn\u2019t contain a bird. Instead, it contained a beautiful emerald jade-like butterfly. It was constantly emitting a green glow and healing the two Gold feys that were defending the young lady at the front.In this Celestial Stairway Dueling Ground, two famous analysts from the Star Web were commentating on the duel with intense tones and explaining the duel\u2019s situation.Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes were totally attracted by the four feys that appeared in the battleground. All four feys were gold-grade, two were healing-type, and they belonged to White Devil.When resisting damage, they were also conducting appropriate counterattacks.The healing-type fey might have mostly healing abilities, but when a fey reached gold-grade, even a healing-type fey would have considerable combat power.The other two were both Lava Bears, violent and power offense-type feys.One of the Lava Bears had reddish purple fur, and when it mauled with its bear claws, it emitted paint-like reddish-purple flames that were like paint. The paint would stick onto the surface of the target and burn. It was just like a liquid flame, and it would corrode and burn anything it touched.3The other Lava Bear had a bigger size, and its fur was bright red. Every time it attacked, the fur would burn with blazing flames. When the flames burst out of the body, they would immediately explode.The two Lava Bears\u2019 attacks gave a hard time to the two plant- and healing-type feys.Unknown Flame\u2019s red pelt armor would also respond according to the two Lava Bears\u2019 attacks on the battleground. She looked at White Devil, who was losing ground, and said, \u201cDaisy, this battle of attrition has been going on for around 10 minutes. The spirit qi in your body is almost exhausted, right?\u201dWhile speaking, Unknown Flame was still rather cautious as she gave a signal to the Lava Bears. The two Lava Bears immediately attacked at the\u00a0Fusang1\u00a0Snow Tree that was struggling to stand.With the addition of two different destructive fire skills, the two Lava Bears\u2019 power severely injured the Fusang Snow Tree, which was weak against fire.This opened up a gap in White Devil\u2019s frontal defense line. White Devil\u2019s forehead was filled with perspiration, but she still said calmly, \u201cThe difference between #18 and #47 isn\u2019t as simple as you imagine.\u201dAfter speaking, White Devil pointed at the severely injured Fusang Snow Tree and yelled, \u201cUse Snow Chill!\u201dIn a split moment, the battleground was enveloped in a layer of frost.Subsequently, she pointed at the Ice Soul Grass, which was struggling to defend, and shouted, \u201cExtreme Cold Block!\u201dThe frost layer that was on the battleground instantly dispersed and all the cold intent formed a pair of massive ice crystals.The two ice crystals sealed up the two Lava Bears in the midst of their battle stances!The two healing-type feys didn\u2019t possess powerful attacks, but when they coordinated their abilities, they were able to seal two power offense-type feys.Unknown Flame leaped backward and looked at White Devil while smirking. \u201cYour Ice Soul Grass and Fusang Snow Tree are unable to fight. Once my two Lava Bears break out of the ice, the outcome of the battle might not be according to our rankings.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget that I am a Healer!\u201dWhite Devil raised the scepter in her hand, and the emerald green butterfly in the birdcage started to radiate lustrous green light.1\u201cRevival Swallowtail Butterfly! Use Wings of Revival!\u201d3At that moment, the Revival Swallowtail Butterfly was enveloped in green light, and all of the power was gathered in the two wings. Subsequently, two green and hazy images of butterfly wings flew to the severely injured Fusang Snow Tree and Ice Soul Grass.All of a sudden, the Fusang Snow Tree and the Ice Soul Grass were like the new sprouts that had been in a drought. They rapidly recovered their injuries.Their injuries might not be fully recovered, but they were combat-ready.Unknown Flame thought it wasn\u2019t good and raised her hand. In an instant, a flaming whirlwind appeared above Unknown Flame\u2019s head and caused the surrounding air to become scorching hot.Boom!A giant bear, the height of seven meters, smashed at the Fusang Snow Tree and Ice Soul Grass, which had just recovered.The sudden attack didn\u2019t allow the Fusang Snow Tree and Ice Soul Grass to dodge in time as they were struck. It was highly possible that the Fusang Snow Tree and the Ice Soul Grass would be severely injured and unable to continue fighting.White Devil looked at Unknown Flame and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect your Flowing Flame Giant Bear to actually reach platinum-grade! However, this duel\u2019s outcome is still going to be the same.\u201dWhite Devil plunged the scepter into the ground and channeled all her spiritual power into the Revival Swallowtail Butterfly before opening the door of the birdcage.When the Revival Swallowtail Butterfly flew out of the birdcage, White Devil\u2019s black hair instantly turned snow white. The Revival Swallowtail Butterfly, which was originally emerald green and filled with vitality, became dark red and gave off a destructive presence.The dark red Revival Swallowtail Butterfly flapped its wings and looked as though its body was a flower that scattered. Then, it split into countless miniature dark red butterflies.These miniature butterflies were just like bullets that shot at the flame-blazing Flowing Flame Giant Bear. The strong burning whirlwind was unable to hinder the dark red Revival Swallowtail Butterflies\u2019 speed.The dark red Revival Swallowtail Butterflies dove into the Flowing Flame Giant Bear\u2019s body and flew out without resistance. They produced a bloody flower as though it was a bright red rose that had just blossomed. This bright red rose blossomed and immediately extinguished the flames on the Flowing Flame Giant Bear.Remarkably beautiful butterflies were flying around in a dance as though it was a rain of flowers.One big and two smaller bear feys were lying on the ground. It was the same as declaring White Devil the victor.Unknown Flame stared blankly at the fallen Flowing Flame Giant Bear and looked up to give White Devil a thumbs up.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect your Revival Swallowtail Butterfly to actually evolve into a Gold Fantasy Breed. I have lost this duel fair and square.\u201dWhite Devil might have a pale face, but she was still calm. \u201cWhen the Revival Swallowtail Butterfly evolved into a Fantasy Breed, it obtained another name\u2014Disaster Swallowtail Butterfly.\u201dThe cheers in the Celestial Stairway Dueling Ground didn\u2019t stop even for a split moment. When White Devil threw her arm over Unknown Flame\u2019s shoulder and raised her hand into the sky, a unified cheer echoed, shaking everyone\u2019s hearts.Stream in the Cloud grabbed onto Lin Yuan\u2019s clothes excitedly and shouted, \u201cWhite Devil Lordress is too cool! Unknown Flame Lordress might have lost, but she is indeed worthy of her power to control bears. She is also overwhelmingly cool!\u201dLin Yuan ignored the excited Stream in the Cloud.Presently, Lin Yuan\u2019s heart was also resonating with indescribable excitement. The warm blood in his heart was like a fountain, and Lin Yuan felt like screaming out.All of a sudden, Lin Yuan heard the analyst announcing.\u201cWhite Devil Lordress, Daisy, defeated Unknown Flame Lordress, Anna. One Star of Celestial Stairway Glory shall be rewarded.\u201dDaisy and Anna, huh?Lin Yuan lamented softly.Daisy, Sequence #18: White DevilAnna, Sequence #47: Unknown FlameLin Yuan finally found out the true names of Sequence #18 White Devil and Sequence #47 Unknown Flame.Is this the top-class combat power of the Radiance Federation\u2019s young generation?Gold Fantasy Breed, Platinum fey\u2026All these were things that he could only look forward to, hopefully.However, in the not so distant future, Lin Yuan also wanted to chase this radiant light.I might have been born as a spot of light on the duckweed, but I will also be able to gather into a vast river of stars. I will catch up one step at a time until I reach the pinnacle of brilliance!8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 37": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 37Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yuan left the Star Web and returned to his little store. His mind focused on the duel between the Radiance Hundred Sequence members.This duel allowed Lin Yuan to find out about the standard of the Radiance Federation\u2019s young generation. At the same time, Lin Yuan also had a deeper understanding as to what a Fantasy Breed was.A Gold Fantasy Breed, healing-type fey was actually able to overwhelm and defeat a Platinum combat-class fey.Lin Yuan had also obtained a Willpower Rune, and it was still floating around Lin Yuan\u2019s spiritual zone with spiritual energy.The floating Willpower Rune formed a mountain pattern, and it was reenacting the rebirth of plants after a great destruction. It emitted a feeling of boundless vitality from a green mountain.This Willpower Rune was very suitable for healing-type feys, and as of now, Lin Yuan\u2019s only healing-type fey was the Jasmine Lily.It was unknown what the Jasmine Lily would transform into when its quality reached Legend, and it fused with this Willpower Rune to become a Fantasy Breed.Not long after returning to the little store, Lin Yuan evolved the remaining pots of Usneas to elite-grade.At that moment, apart from the contracted feys, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have other feys to evolve.The book microchips, the five Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders, the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, the energy ores, and the Butterfly Shells that he had purchased on the Star Web had yet to arrive.Seeing that his house had nearly no food ingredients, Lin Yuan carried Genius and Chimey out.Genius stood on Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder while Chimey stood on Genius\u2019 little head. Chimey was chirping out loudly and was in a great mood.Lin Yuan smiled at Genius and Chimey while saying, \u201cGenius, Chimey, I will bring the two of you out for shopping. Let\u2019s go.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan was previously maintaining the store, it wasn\u2019t earning much money. Even if it earned some money, Lin Yuan would save them up for Chu Ci\u2019s future school fees.Apart from purchasing goods, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have many chances to bring Genius and Chimey out for a shopping trip.Now that Lin Yuan had money, he naturally wouldn\u2019t be as thrifty as before.On this trip, apart from the purchase of fruits and vegetables, the rest of the Federation dollars were used to purchase the daily necessities.Of course, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t need much of any daily necessities, and most of them were actually for Genius and Chimey.Lin Yuan had already purchased several bags of energy biscuits that were suitable for elite-grade omnivorous feys. He had also purchased some consumable spiritual ingredients for Chimey that could enhance its feathers\u2019 durability.After pushing a whole stack of daily necessities back home, someone knocked on the door of the store.Lin Yuan opened the door to see a man wearing the Ostrich Logistics\u2019 uniform. He had put down several spirit storage boxes on the ground.\u201cI am Ostrich Logistics Courier No.75457. I have delivered this sir\u2019s goods that were purchased on the Star Web on time. Please sign for them here.\u201d3Lin Yuan quickly signed. All the things that he had purchased from the Star Web had already arrived.\u201cThank you.\u201dAfter obtaining Lin Yuan\u2019s signature and ensuring that the items were correct, the courier left.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but be amazed at the efficiency of Ostrich Logistics. It was truly living up to its reputation.As long as it was within the Radiance Federation, Ostrich Logistics would be able to deliver the goods within three hours.6After signing for the goods, Lin Yuan shifted the spirit storage boxes into the house and started off by taking out the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.When Lin Yuan took the Normal I/Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish out of the spirit storage box, it was very frail. It felt as though Lin Yuan would take this little fellow\u2019s life with just a light grip.The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish struggled lightly in Lin Yuan\u2019s hand. The two protruding black eyes on its head looked very silly and cute.Lin Yuan immediately used Morbius\u2019 exclusive skill, Spirit Lock, to turn the Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish into Morbius\u2019 Elite spirit-locked fey.Subsequently, Lin Yuan started to evolve the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. When the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish reached elite-grade, Lin Yuan took a glance at the time.It took me over one hour to evolve the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. Furthermore, the growth of spiritual power in my body is exactly the same as the growth when I evolved a pot of Usnea to elite-grade.The difficulty of evolving the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was truly living up to its notorious fame.It was no wonder the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was an unpopular fey among Creation Masters.After the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish reached elite-grade, it became more than two times bigger than before. The scales on its body weren\u2019t as mottled, and it became smooth like satin. It felt just like a layer of black silk wrapping on the body. The tail had bloomed like a half-opened umbrella. The two massive eyes on the head didn\u2019t change, but there was a layer of faint golden scales around the eyes. The golden scales might be weaved together with the black scales, but it was rather prominent when observing it closely.1The Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was considered a famous subspecies. If Lin Yuan were to put this Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to sell on the Star Web store, he would easily earn 8 Radiance dollars.After evolving the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, Lin Yuan entered the Spirit Lock spatial zone and poured the 2,000 catties worth of inferior energy ores from the spirit storage box into the spirit pool.The inferior energy ores immediately disintegrated inside the spirit pool and turned into spirit qi that was released into the Spirit Lock spatial zone.Lin Yuan was constantly pouring the inferior energy ores into the pool, and when he poured in around 1,700 catties, the spirit pool didn\u2019t continue disintegrating the inferior energy ores.Lin Yuan knew that this was the spirit qi\u2019s concentration limit in the Spirit Lock spatial zone.When making a comparison, Lin Yuan realized that the spirit qi concentration in the Spirit Lock spatial zone was around five times more than the outside world.Lin Yuan was extremely satisfied as the Spirit Lock spatial zone would constantly be upgraded when Morbius evolved. By then, the spirit qi concentration would only become denser.As for the remaining 300 catties of energy ores that were poured into the spirit pool, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t bother. Be it the Jasmine Lily or the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, they would be rapidly using up the spirit qi within the Spirit-Lock spatial zone.Once the spirit qi concentration in the spatial zone was reduced, the spirit pool would automatically disintegrate the remaining energy ores for replenishment.Lin Yuan placed the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish into the Spirit Pool, and it immediately swam around with content.5At that moment, Lin Yuan could feel the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish gradually absorbing the spirit qi in the spatial zone.Lin Yuan compared and analyzed the speed of him evolving the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish personally and the speed of the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish absorbing the pure spirit qi in the spatial zone automatically.If the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was to evolve from normal-grade to elite-grade in this Spirit Lock spatial zone, it would need about ten days.Of course, the precondition was to have a constant supply of energy ores within these ten days.2After calculating the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s growth speed in the Spirit Lock spatial zone, Lin Yuan decided the direction of the Star Web store\u2019s development. He was going to rely on selling Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to build his reputation.If a huge quantity of Elite- Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, which were highly demanded, were to appear in the Purchase With No Loss Fey Store, it would probably cause his store\u2019s reputation to soar.3Lin Yuan then scattered the Butterfly Shells at the bottom of the Spirit Pool.When the Butterfly Shells entered the water and landed on top of the white energy ores, they looked like scattered ginkgo leaves in autumn. It was an especially beautiful scenery.The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish immediately bit one of the Butterfly Shells and consumed it, gradually absorbing its energy.1The Butterfly Shells would have more or less some effects to awaken the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s bloodline.However, the effects weren\u2019t significant.Lin Yuan thought that if he could obtain the blood of a dragon-species fey before the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s quality reached Epic, it would increase its chances of awakening the rare dragon-species bloodline greatly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 38": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayA dragon fey\u2019s blood was considered a precious spiritual ingredient, and the prices were naturally extremely high.Most of the dragon feys were above gold-grade.If the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish reached bronze-grade and awakened the rare dragon-species bloodline, it wouldn\u2019t be considered a dragon-species fey unless the bloodline concentration reached a certain standard.From this point, it was obvious that the dragon-species fey\u2019s blood was very hard to obtain.Rare spiritual ingredients, such as a dragon fey\u2019s fresh blood, were all sold by the drop.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t really understand the dragon-species feys\u2019 price, but it was fortunate that he had added Zhou Jiaxin on the Star Web as a friend. By then, he just had to ask Zhou Jiaxin.He might not know how much a dragon-species fey\u2019s blood cost, but it was certainly very expensive.1Lin Yuan wanted to earn more money and prepare the amount needed to purchase the dragon-species blood in advance.He was going to set a small target to earn 100,000,000 Federation dollars, which was also 100 Radiance dollars.3The spirit qi concentration inside the Spirit Lock spatial zone was five times more concentrated than outside.Lin Yuan circulated the spirit qi and realized that even though the circulation speed didn\u2019t change, the efficiency increased to around five times the speed due to the concentrated spirit passing through his body. This discovery left Lin Yuan pleasantly surprised.Lin Yuan quickly took an Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders out of the spirit storage box and placed it inside the Spirit Lock spatial zone. He then rapidly channeled the spirit qi to enhance the Web-Spraying Spider.1When Lin Yuan was enhancing Web-Spraying Spider, he could feel a boundary inside the Web-Spraying Spider\u2019s body. The boundary felt like it could be shattered if Lin Yuan charged into it a few times with spirit qi.However, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t do so. If he broke through the boundary, the Web-Spraying Spider would evolve from elite-grade to bronze-grade with flawless-quality. That wasn\u2019t what Lin Yuan wanted.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t use the spirit qi to smash through the boundary, but instead constantly poured the spirit qi into the Web-Spraying Spider\u2019s body. He allowed the Web-Spraying Spider to absorb as much spirit qi as possible to enhance its quality.2After a certain period of time, the Web-Spraying Spider\u2019s quality reached Epic, so Lin Yuan stopped channeling the spirit qi. He looked at the time and realized that it took him over two hours to break through Flawless to Epic.Had he not been enhancing the Web-Spraying Spider in the Spirit Lock spatial zone, he would probably have needed to spend over a dozen hours. Furthermore, this speed was because he had progressed into a D-rank spirit qi professional.The results stated that it was much harder to increase the quality of a fey than to evolve it. Furthermore, this was just enhancing it from Flawless to Epic. How much more time and effort would be required to enhance them from Epic to Legend?Lin Yuan suddenly realized that the spirit qi concentration in the Spirit Lock spatial zone was no longer five times more concentrated than outside.He looked at the Spirit Pool and realized that the 300 catties of inferior energy ores at the bottom of the Spirit Pool had already vanished. They had been used up when Lin Yuan increased Web-Spraying Spider\u2019s quality.Lin Yuan made a calculation by using the number of inferior energy ores used. In order to enhance one Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spider to Elite X/Epic, it would need 700 catties of inferior energy ores.It was around 0.35 Radiance dollars according to the purchase price of the materials. There was a certain price to pay to make use of the increased speed of enhancement and evolution in the Spirit-Lock spatial zone.2However, the price to pay was nearly negligible when comparing it with the speed. The biggest problem that Lin Yuan had right now was the lack of funds. Without enough funds, he wouldn\u2019t be able to purchase more inferior energy ores, and it was rather vexing for Lin Yuan.Lin Yuan brought the Elite X/Epic Web-Spraying Spider out of the Spirit Lock spatial zone and didn\u2019t continue to enhance the four remaining Web-Spraying Spiders.Instead, he made the preparations for Genius to memorize the books on the primary rank of Scholar, Fey Observer, and Spiritual Ingredient Analyst.The Hundred Questions Beast required time to memorize new knowledge, but it was rather fast. To memorize 300 over books it would only require around 20 days.When it was time for Lin Yuan to visit Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store to look for hidden goods, Genius would have already memorized the needed knowledge. Afterward, Lin Yuan could take the exam for the Creation Master occupation.Once he passed the exam to become a Creation Master, he would be like a flood dragon entering the sea or a peacock returning to the forest. His future path would be headed for the sky, and it would be particularly spacious.3Lin Yuan applied for a Star Web account for Genius and entered the book microchips into Genius\u2019 Star Web account.Genius then sat there, obediently to study carefully. It had always been passionate about studying.Lin Yuan logged into the Star Web and entered his small store. He suddenly noticed that all the pots of Usneas had been completely reserved.Lin Yuan was rather surprised that all the Elite/Elite Usneas would be sold out in such a short period of time. Also, numerous people had actually left messages saying that they wanted to order more Elite Usneas.It seemed like there wasn\u2019t a need to worry about the hot-selling items, no matter the timing.It was different from other feys, which might also be great, but due to the limited demand, they might not be able to sell out quickly.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t reply to these messages as he was planning to only use Bronze Usneas for the next sale. Lin Yuan was preparing to break through from a D-rank spirit qi professional into a C-rank spirit qi professional.1After becoming a C-rank spirit qi professional, I will be able to evolve feys to bronze-grade with a much faster speed.Lin Yuan knew that he was able to evolve feys to bronze-grade, but he felt a little unmotivated if he had to increase the quality of a Bronze fey.Only after becoming a C-rank spirit qi professional, Lin Yuan would be able to increase the Bronze fey\u2019s quality to Legend and allow it to transform into the Fantasy Breed.Lin Yuan hadn\u2019t set a fixed price for the two other Web-Spraying Spiders so that the ones that were willing to purchase them would leave the price with the AI robot. The prices offered were actually more than what he expected.Three individuals had made an offer for the Web-Spraying Spider with the Adhesive Spider Web skill, and the highest offer was 1.1 Radiance dollars.As for the other Web-Spraying Spider that had awakened the Violent Venom skill, only one person had made an offer, and the price was 1.3 Radiance dollars.The bids weren\u2019t considered high, but if Lin Yuan was willing to wait, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem to sell the Bronze Web-Spraying Spiders for 2.7 Radiance dollars.However, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have the choice to wait. He immediately responded to the two individuals who had offered the highest price and sold the two Bronze Web-Spraying Spiders.3Immediately after, he used his store\u2019s name to contact Ostrich Logistics and make the delivery.Newly opened stores on the Star Web could sign a contract with Ostrich Logistics for them to arrange and deliver the goods. However, for each item that Ostrich Logistics delivered, they would take a commission based on the goods\u2019 price.Ostrich Logistics took a rather high commission, but they were fast and safe. If something happened, they would compensate for the losses. It was also why so many individuals were willing to choose Ostrich Logistics.1Now that the two Web-Spraying Spiders and the Elite Usneas had been sold, Lin Yuan\u2019s financial crisis was immediately resolved.1\u2026Chimey was chirping and singing. After singing for quite some time, it felt rather bored. When it saw Lin Yuan and Genius busy using the Star Web, Chimey\u2019s eyes flickered before it jumped onto Genius\u2019 head.It chirped and said, \u201cGenius, Genius, do you think my singing is nice?\u201d\u201cIt is nice! And it is getting better!\u201dGenius didn\u2019t know why Chimey was asking this question, as Chimey was normally very shy.\u201cGenius, can you secretly apply for a Star Web account for me? I want to start a live stream!\u201dAfter speaking, it let out two chirps and took a glance at its azure blue feathers, and said confidently, \u201cI want to become an attractive host with a beautiful voice! My name shall be Sparrow Voice Loli Goddess!\u201d4\u201cBut you are a bird!\u201d2When looking at Genius\u2019 silly expression, Chimey felt it was the smarter of the duo. \u201cYou can just help me put on a GIF, right?!\u201d7Chimey felt that it was the prettiest and most clever Sound Bird with the best singing voice right now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 39": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 39Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChimey would be singing at home whenever it didn\u2019t have anything to do. Lin Yuan was already used to Chimey\u2019s singing, its routine activity at home.Therefore, Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t paying attention to Chimey when it was singing seriously.After Genius reached elite-grade, most of its capabilities were already comparable with humans. In fact, its memory was several times better than humans. Soon, Chimey successfully became a beautiful host with an amazing voice with Genius\u2019 help.At that moment, a cute GIF of a loli was blocking half the screen, and Chimey was singing behind the GIF.When a host just started their channel, it was normal not to have many viewers\u2014one or two occasional people would pass by and quickly exit the channel.However, Chimey\u2019s singing was just like that phoenix\u2019s clear chirping on the Kun Mountain and the rustling leaves of the purple bamboo forest. It sounded interesting and appealing, even mellower than the morning dew that dripped down from the pandan leaves.Therefore, Chimey\u2019s live streaming room became a \u2018Cave of the Silken\u00a0Web1\u2018 where one couldn\u2019t escape after entering.3Those who entered had no thoughts of leaving.\u201cWow! How can there be such a nice voice in this world!? It is a fairy singing!\u201d1\u201cLittle Sister, why are you using a GIF to block your face? Shouldn\u2019t a beautiful host be showing their face?\u201d\u201cCould this song be Little Sister\u2019s original song? I have searched for the lyrics on the Star Web but couldn\u2019t find any match!\u201dEach of the viewers that entered the room couldn\u2019t help but start to praise Chimey like a violent storm. There was even a generous viewer that instantly rewarded Chimey with 500 Federation dollars!3These people had been blasting messages for a long time but realized that the host didn\u2019t reply to them. They actually felt that the host had a unique personality, so they turned into dogs that continued to lick and shower the host with praises.5The current circumstances were mainly due to Chimey\u2019s great singing that was simply too amazing.Chimey might be calm on the surface, but its heart was already racing. Chimey wanted to send a message for the viewers to praise it more, but it didn\u2019t know how to reply, and Genius was diligently studying the books Lin Yuan had arranged.Chimey had no choice but to pretend that it didn\u2019t see the messages and continued singing. After Chimey was tired from singing, it casually switched off the live stream.However, Chimey didn\u2019t know that when it had been singing earlier, one of the viewers had actually recorded the live stream and posted it on the Star Web.1The name \u2018Sparrow Voice Loli Goddess\u2019 spread like wildfire. It was like a spark in the plains during autumn that turned into a raging prairie fire.A short moment later, a knocking sound echoed in Lin Yuan\u2019s store.When Lin Yuan opened the door, he saw a 1,7-meter tall girl. She was wearing the Ostrich Logistics\u2019 uniform and had short dark-red hair. It was a cool hairstyle, but it was particularly bashful on this girl\u2019s face.\u201cHello. Are you the store owner for Purchase With No Loss, Mister Deep Mountain Elder Lin?\u201dWhen speaking, the girl was silently clenching her hands as she was rather nervous, and her tone sounded a little shaky.Upon noticing the Ostrich Logistics\u2019 uniform on the girl, Lin Yuan knew that she was here to pick up the goods. He immediately replied, \u201cThat\u2019s right. It is me. You should be here to pick up the goods, right?\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s acknowledgment allowed the girl with the short dark-red short heave a sigh of relief. She let out a shy laugh and said, \u201cI am the newcomer Courier No.3451. My name is Ah Neng. According to your contract, I shall be Purchase With No Loss Store\u2019s dedicated courier.\u201dLin Yuan felt that Ah Neng was very cute when he saw her actually place her fist at her chest to encourage herself.\u201cThen, I shall trouble you from now on, Miss Ah Neng.\u201d\u201cDoes this mean that Mister Deep Mountain Elder Lin agrees for me to be the dedicated courier for Purchase With No Loss Store and will not change me?\u201d2Ah Neng was pleasantly surprised as she smiled and revealed her two tiger teeth. It looked as though she had encountered a great thing.1At that moment, Lin Yuan recalled that the contract with Ostrich Logistics mentioned the service to apply for a change of dedicated courier.Upon seeing Ah Neng\u2019s expression, Lin Yuan could imagine that Ah Neng had been switched out more than once.After Lin Yuan gave the affirmative nod, Ah Neng immediately yelled out, \u201cYeah!\u201dSubsequently, she circulated her spiritual energy and summoned two of her contracted feys.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect a young-looking girl like her to actually possess Gold and Silver feys.\u201cI am very formidable! Super aggressive! That\u2019s why there will be no problem with the goods as long as you hand them to me! If there are any accidents, I will use my Bullet Rain to extinguish the enemies with pain!\u201d2Ah Neng was afraid that Lin Yuan might not be at ease and was doing her best to prove her strength.Upon seeing the two feys Lin Yuan knew that she was a spirit qi professional with high potential that Ostrich Logistics had nurtured. However, he couldn\u2019t understand why she would become his dedicated courier.Gold Armor-Piercing Insect.Silver Canister Shot Insect.These two feys\u2019 attacks would be just like a concentrated rain of bullets that had extreme lethality.2It seemed like Ah Neng wasn\u2019t as bashful as she seemed, and deep down inside, she was a person that worshiped violence.5Ah Neng happily packaged the goods that had to be delivered for Lin Yuan and said, \u201cThis might be my first task, but I can guarantee that I will deliver all of them safely within two hours. I will not even need the three hours stated in the contract.\u201dShe then left cheerfully.Surprisingly, just as Ah Neng left, Lin Yuan saw a few pieces of paper dropping on the ground. He quickly picked them up and chased after Ah Neng while calling out to her. He then handed over the courier lists that had dropped on the ground.Ah Neng was originally in a great mood, but after seeing the courier lists Lin Yuan handed over, her face immediately turned red. She ran off like a little rabbit immediately after receiving the courier lists.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but criticize in his heart. He felt that newcomers were definitely not as reliable.After returning home, Lin Yuan realized that he had already received 3.9 Radiance dollars within two hours. This amount was for the sale of the Elite Usneas and the two Bronze Web-Spraying Spiders.Lin Yuan immediately felt invigorated with the 3.9 Radiance dollars, so he logged into the Star Web to contact Zhou Jiaxin.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cBig Sister Xin, I wish to order another 4,000 catties of inferior energy ores! And three Butterfly Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish of random colors.\u201dWithin a few minutes, Lin Yuan spent the money that he had just earned. He was left with merely 0.4 Radiance dollars.Lin Yuan would need 1,000 Federation dollars for three months\u2019 expenses, and he would still have some spare in the past.However, now, Lin Yuan felt that it was irresistible to spend Radiance dollars. He didn\u2019t know if it was because of his confidence or that he was stronger for him to actually have such thoughts.Zhou Jiaxin: \u201cYou still need 4,000 catties of inferior energy ores? I have the stock. If you need them, I will send them to you immediately. As for the three Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, I remember there are three rather good-looking Butterfly Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish in the pond. I will fish them up for you.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: The Importance of ConnectionsZhou Jiaxin quickly saw the order and responded to Lin Yuan.However, she couldn\u2019t understand why this customer of hers would need so many inferior energy ores for.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cThen I shall thank Big Sister Xin! Does Big Sister Xin have any dragon blood?\u201dZhou Jiaxin pondered for a long time before replying to Lin Yuan: \u201cI do have some stock of dragon blood. I wonder how much you need?\u201dLin Yuan had been searching on the Star Web and hadn\u2019t been able to find any store selling dragon blood. He vaguely felt that it was impossible to purchase spiritual ingredients with just money and would need better connections.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cBig Sister Xin, what is the price for dragon blood now?\u201dZhou Jiaxin: \u201cThe price of gold-grade dragon blood is 80 Radiance dollars for one drop. The price of platinum-grade dragon blood is 2,000 Radiance dollars for a drop.\u201dZhou Jiaxin had already made a decision in her heart to build a good relationship with Lin Yuan. One of the factors was due to her good impression of Lin Yuan during the day. Another factor was because of Lin Yuan\u2019s purchasing power.Lin Yuan had only visited the store for the first day and had already spent 5 Radiance dollars in a few hours. Such a customer was definitely worth tying down.Lin Yuan had already given a higher estimation for the price of dragon blood, but he didn\u2019t think that it would actually be so expensive.If a single drop of platinum-grade dragon blood cost 2,000 radiance dollars, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t dare to imagine the price of a Platinum dragon fey.In order to activate the rare dragon bloodline in the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s bodies when they reached bronze-grade, gold-grade dragon blood might already be enough. If he was lucky, a single drop of the dragon blood would do the trick, but it would be more conservative in preparing three drops.In regards to his own feys\u2019 evolutions, Lin Yuan wanted to be properly prepared for everything.When Zhou Jiaxin noticed that Lin Yuan didn\u2019t reply for a long time, she immediately sent another message.Zhou Jiaxin: \u201cThe price I offered to you might be higher than the lowest price in the market, but I can ensure that the concentration of the dragon blood hasn\u2019t been diluted at all.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan saw Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s message, he couldn\u2019t help but have a better impression of her.When purchasing spiritual ingredients, the terrifying thing was to guarantee the spiritual ingredient\u2019s quality. If the spiritual ingredient\u2019s quality didn\u2019t reach a certain standard, when a Creation Master was evolving a fey, it might cause the evolution to fail or an incomplete evolution.If it was a failed evolution, the process could be restarted. But if it was an incomplete evolution, then certain aspects of the fey would definitely be weakened after the evolution.Evolution was a gift to life and the most creative process of natural selection in the natural world. Thus, evolutions were never reversible.It was why the quality of spiritual ingredients played a huge role.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cBig Sister Xin, I might order a batch of Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish from your store in the next few days. I want the Butterfly Telescope subspecies. As for the dragon blood, we will make a deal when I visit your store on the 27th.\u201dZhou Jiaxin: \u201cDon\u2019t you worry. I will pick out all the Normal Butterfly Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish for you. I guarantee that all of them are great-looking.\u201dWhen reading that Lin Yuan was preparing to make so many orders, Zhou Jiaxin was delighted. In her heart, she felt that it was the correct decision to build a good relationship with Lin Yuan.Now that Lin Yuan learned the dragon blood\u2019s price, he started to calculate in his heart. The gold-grade dragon blood\u2019s price was 80 Radiance dollars for a drop, and Lin Yuan required three drops. It meant that Lin Yuan would need to prepare at least 240 Radiance dollars.240 Radiance dollars wasn\u2019t a small sum for Lin Yuan, but it wasn\u2019t an astronomical amount that he couldn\u2019t collect.Therefore, Lin Yuan made a plan to earn money.\u2026After receiving the goods from Zhou Jiaxin, Lin Yuan would enter the Spirit-Lock spatial zone and enhance the four remaining Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders.As for the three Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, Lin Yuan was going to place them in the spirit pool in the spatial zone.Lin Yuan had chosen Butterfly Telescope goldfish because this was the best-selling subspecies among all the Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.The tea-colored Butterfly Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish were swimming around cheerfully in the spirit pool, and they looked delighted.It was obvious that the high concentration of spirit qi in the Spirit Lock spatial zone was the best living environment for the Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.The three Spirit-Siphon Goldfish were just like amber-colored camellias blooming in the depths of the spirit pool. Along with the spirit-locked Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, the four Spirit-Siphon Goldfish gave off a poetry-like feeling to this spirit pool.In the beginning, the three Normal and one Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish were living together nicely in the spirit pool. However, when the three Normal Butterfly Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish wanted to eat the Butterfly Shells, the Elite Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish attacked them.It started to brandish its tail in the water and lash at the three Normal Butterfly Telescope goldfish.Although the tail lash\u2019s power might not be great and humans wouldn\u2019t feel anything, when it lashed on the three obviously smaller Butterfly Telescope goldfish, the trio was sent tumbling in the spirit pool. They tumbled for three rounds before gradually stopping.After a few attacks, even though the three Normal Butterfly Telescope goldfish felt that the Butterfly Shells could benefit them, they still didn\u2019t dare to take a bite.Lin Yuan burst out in laughter. It was fortunate that this Elite goldfish could protect the Butterfly Shells. Otherwise, he would need to think of a method to isolate the three Butterfly Telescope goldfish.These three tea-colored Butterfly Telescope goldfish would be able to reach elite-grade within five days. Lin Yuan was planning to put them on sale in the Star Web store when they reached elite-grade, setting a price of 8 Radiance dollars.Therefore, letting these three Butterfly Telescope goldfish eat the Butterfly Shells would be just a waste.However, Lin Yuan was rather surprised. These four Spirit-Siphon Goldfish had been living together in the pond at Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store previously. However, after Lin Yuan\u2019s spirit-locked goldfish reached elite-grade, it actually attacked its previous companions because of resources.Lin Yuan realized that this wasn\u2019t just the process of natural selection. It was also the survival of the fittest.It made Lin Yuan understand why strong individuals would grow stronger while weak individuals would have a hard time rising up.The Elite Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish swam around the spirit pool willfully while the three Butterfly Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish would gather and cower in a corner. They didn\u2019t dare to swim toward the center of the spirit pool at all.Lin Yuan could vaguely feel that even though the spirit pool no longer had any energy ores, there was still a trace of spirit qi constantly pouring into the Spirit Lock spatial zone.This was the great effect of breeding Spirit-Siphon Goldfish in the Spirit-Lock spatial zone.However, the speed of spirit qi being released from the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish and its consumption speed was truly disproportionate.During this period of time, Lin Yuan had constantly been pouring the 4,000 catties of inferior energy ores into the spirit pool.For the next two days, Lin Yuan finally enhanced the five Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders to Elite X/Epic.Lin Yuan let out a relaxed breath and stood up to stretch his body. \u201cIt is time to hand these custom feys to that braised egg head, Stream in the Cloud.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: A Surprising CustomerLin Yuan entered his Star Web store and realized that there were actually two individuals in an intense quarrel beside the AI robot.Lin Yuan was a little baffled as all of the items in the store had already been sold. What exactly was the duo\u2019s objective? Why were they quarreling?At that moment, Lin Yuan heard a rather strange and unique voice. \u201cA woman is fundamentally weak. Those who become mothers would become strong-willed. This Big Sister is very noble, are you even fit to speak with this Big Sister like this?\u201dThe woman placed a hand on her waist, and it seemed like that she was extremely enraged.In the next instant, Lin Yuan heard an abnormally calm voice. \u201cI have prayed to Buddha, and Buddha said that you shouldn\u2019t think of snatching from me no matter what\u2014\u201dBefore the calm voice could finish talking, the enraged woman immediately followed up. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t the Buddha ask you to toss your bone ashes? Previously, you and I entered together, but you said that you are in a hurry, so I allowed you to order first. But you actually ordered all of the Elite Usneas! Shameless!\u201d\u201cBuddha said\u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me what the Buddha is saying! Do you think you are karma!? Since I helped you, you should return the favor! You aren\u2019t going to return the favor, and I have to help you again!? I have helped you previously, but you actually reprimanded me! Let\u2019s see if I will stab you!\u201d\u201cBuddha said I didn\u2019t reprimand you, when did I\u2014\u201d\u201cStop all this nonsense! If you are unhappy, add me as a Star Web friend, and we will arrange for a meeting in real life. See if I will really stab you!\u201d\u201cBuddha said\u2026\u201dLin Yuan gasped in amazement. This violent-tempered woman was actually able to quarrel with a person that was more inclined to Buddhism than Buddha himself.At the same time, the violent-tempered woman was going to be enraged to death.Before the violent-tempered woman was about to make a move, Lin Yuan quickly stopped them.\u201cWhy are the two of you quarreling in my store!? I have nothing on sale in my store now. Come back again once there are goods to sell.\u201dAfter speaking, Lin Yuan minded his own business and displayed the five Elite X/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders in the Star Web store.Lin Yuan then heard two gasps.These were five Elite X/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders, so it was no wonder the duo was astonished.Elite X/Epic feys represented a kind of foundation. For five to appear together, it meant that a Creation Master backed this little store.There were plenty of stores in the Star Web, but ones that were supported and backed by Creation Masters were rare. Only large stores were qualified to be supported by Creation Masters.However, no one expected an unknown Class 1 store to be backed by a Creation Master.When Lin Yuan heard the duo mentioning his Web-Spraying Spiders, he informed them, \u201cThese are custom-ordered feys. They are not for sale.\u201dAfter hearing that these were custom-ordered feys, the duo looked at Lin Yuan with even more respect.In order to enhance Elite feys to epic-quality, one would need to be a Class 2 Creation Master.A Class 1 Creation Master could accomplish it, but they would need to use a large number of spiritual ingredients to do so. It was fine for Class 1 Creation Masters to increase the grade, but to enhance the quality, Class 1 Creation Masters had a much lower efficiency and speed.In order to enhance five feys to epic-quality at once, it was only possible for a Class 2 Creation Master.Class 1 Creation Masters were already limited in numbers\u2014among every 30 Class 1 Creation Masters, only one of them would achieve in becoming a Class 2 Creation Master. It was truly the cream of the crop.Since a Class 2 Creation Master was overseeing the place, it was a must to curry favor with the one in charge.\u201cI wonder what kind of spiritual ingredients are required to make a custom order in this store?\u201dWhen he heard the duo\u2019s questions, Lin Yuan realized that these two hadn\u2019t read the custom order rules that he had written on the AI robot\u2019s information board.\u201cThe store is currently accepting Radiance dollars for custom-ordered feys. The price will be based on the required custom-ordered fey.\u201dThe duo felt it was unbelievable, and they subsequently became ecstatic.There is actually no need for spiritual ingredients!? And the only requirement is Radiance dollars? Since when did Creation Masters\u2019 standard of making custom-ordered feys Creation Masters become so low?\u201cMay I ask if I can custom order feys now?\u201dLin Yuan shook his head.He had signed a custom-order contract with Stream in the Cloud, which stated that the contract would only end after producing the exclusive skill, Transparent Spider Web.The first phase was to produce five custom-ordered feys.If all 15 choices of exclusive skills from these five Web-Spraying Spiders didn\u2019t contain the Transparent Spider Web, Stream in the Cloud would continue to make custom orders of Elite/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders from him.Moreover, Lin Yuan was planning to achieve a significant progression for his feys\u2019 grade and quality before visiting Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store on the 27th. He wanted to enhance Genius, Chimey, the spirit-locked Jasmine Lily, and the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to elite-grade and epic-quality first.As such, Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t planning to accept any custom orders during this period of time.As for the money to purchase the gold-grade dragon blood, he would constantly be producing Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish in the Spirit Lock spatial zone during these 20+ days.He would be able to nurture four batches of Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. By then, he would have enough after selling all of the Elite goldfish.\u201cI will only be accepting custom orders next month.\u201dThe duo revealed delighted expressions and nodded after hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s response.When they recalled the objective of their visits, they quickly asked Lin Yuan, \u201cI wonder if you still have any Elite Usneas?\u201dSo far, the duo seemed to be in sync as they would always be saying the same thing, just with different mouths.They didn\u2019t expect the other party to dare mention about the Elite Usneas. Unsurprisingly, they were immediately enraged and about to start bickering again.Lin Yuan had a headache and immediately stopped them. \u201cIf I am selling anything else, I will not be selling any more Elite Usneas.\u201dThe two individuals were disappointed, but they didn\u2019t expect Lin Yuan to turn the topic around.\u201cI might not be selling Elite Usneas, but the store will sell Bronze Usneas and Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish in the future. You are welcome to make reservations.\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s objective was to earn Radiance dollars quickly. If he wanted to increase his strength, the expenditure of Radiance dollars would be the same as a river\u2019s water flowing straight into the sea.Therefore, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t mind putting on an advertisement for his store.One should know that the clothes one wore in the real world would be materialized in the Star Web. The two individuals\u2019 clothes were spiritual ones, meaning Weavers, the lifestyle-class spirit qi occupation, had produced them.Thus, it was logical to assume that their spending capability would be of a certain standard.When they heard Lin Yuan\u2019s statement, their jaws nearly dropped to the ground. At the same time, they started to suspect their lives.Bronze Usneas?Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish?These feys were rarely available in the Star Web!One might occasionally discover Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish in Star Web stores, however, no one would be silly enough to sell Bronze Usneas in their store.One could frequently buy a Bronze Usnea\u2019s vines from high-class stores on the Star Web, and a batch of 5,000 vines was worth 1 Radiance dollar.A Bronze Usnea would need merely one and half a year to produce 5,000 vines. Therefore, a Bronze Usnea was equivalent to a hen that would automatically produce Radiance dollars.If a person was able to buy a Bronze Usnea, it was the same as purchasing a house, and selling the vines would be the same as receiving rent.The Bronze Usnea would remain the same, and the vines produced on a daily basis would serve as pure profit!\u201cYoung Brother, may I ask about the price of the Bronze Usneas and the Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish?\u201dLin Yuan had already set a price long ago.\u201cThe Bronze Usneas\u2019 price is 5 Radiance dollars. As for the Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, they will all be of the Butterfly Telescope subspecies. Their price is 8 Radiance dollars.\u201dThen, Lin Yuan supplemented with another statement. \u201cBy then, the buying process will still be the snap up scheme\u2014first come, first served. But if you quarrel in here again, you will enter the store\u2019s blacklist and will never be able to buy any fey from here again.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Revival SoilAs Lin Yuan stated this, he was thinking of setting a rule for his store. It wouldn\u2019t be that kind of rule that was so rigid as the old saying, \u201cIf there are no rules, there will not be a proper perimeter\u2026\u201dHowever, Lin Yuan just didn\u2019t wish to handle such pointless conflicts. If someone was to fight in his store, it wouldn\u2019t be great for his store\u2019s reputation or development.The violent-tempered woman and the Buddhism-inclined person expressed that they would closely monitor Lin Yuan\u2019s store for the next two days. If there were any new items for sale, they would snatch them up.The Buddhism-inclined person left, but the violent-tempered woman stayed behind. She stood in place, unwilling to leave.Lin Yuan took a glance and understood that this violent-tempered woman had something to say but didn\u2019t know how to say it.Lin Yuan took the initiative and asked, \u201cIf you have anything, you can ask me directly. But this store doesn\u2019t have anything to sell right now.\u201dAfter hesitating for a long time, the violent tempered woman asked carefully, \u201cMay I know if this store is able to heal feys with severely injured roots?\u201dLin Yuan thought that it would be something else. He was naturally able to heal a severely injured fey. However, he was still a D-rank spirit qi professional, and the fey that he would be healing couldn\u2019t be higher than silver-grade.If the fey was above silver-grade, Lin Yuan\u2019s healing session would be several times longer, and it would be extremely slow.Currently, Lin Yuan was only confident in healing a Bronze fey swiftly.\u201cThe store is indeed able to heal severely injured feys, but only ones below Silver. The store isn\u2019t going to accept jobs to heal Silver feys and above.\u201dAs soon as Lin Yuan ended the statement, the violent-tempered person suddenly yelled out with tears, \u201cMy daughter\u2019s fey is finally going to be saved! It is finally going to be rescued!\u201dThe moment the violent-tempered woman teared up, Lin Yuan involuntarily recalled the words she had uttered when he had just arrived at the store.\u201cA woman is fundamentally weak. Those who become mothers would become strong-willed.\u201dHowever, no matter how strong-willed a mother was, she would always be gentle and fragile when facing her children.After crying for a period of time, the violent-tempered woman continued to say, \u201cIt is a Bronze fey. My daughter\u2019s Bronze fey had been at the previous dimensional rift\u2019s vicinity to train. The flames of a Horn Demon burned its root.\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s heart sank when he heard the two words, \u2018Horn Demon\u2019.The Horn Demon was a monster from the Demon Dimensional Rift. It had a body of a barbaric bull, and it was extremely strong.While charging its giant horns would attack the target. When the horns struck at the target, they would automatically ignite and activate the Burning Charge. The attack\u2019s damage was truly dreadful.No matter how powerful a regular flame was, it wouldn\u2019t damage the roots of a fey. However, the Horn Demon\u2019s flames had a withering effect.The withering effect was unexpectedly lethal against plant-type feys, and the Horn Demon\u2019s Burning Charge would only injure plant-type feys\u2019 roots.\u201cThen make an appointment in advance. In October, bring your daughter and her fey to the store. I will diagnose it before arranging for the treatment.\u201dAfter Lin Yuan agreed, the violent-tempered woman finally relaxed, and she constantly thanked him.\u201cOwner, what are the fees for the treatment? I am afraid that I do not have enough money now. But don\u2019t you worry, I will definitely gather enough money by next month!\u201dLin Yuan pondered for a moment and gave the price.\u201cI don\u2019t need Radiance dollars. You just need to find me a bag of Revival Soil.\u201dOnly Class 2 Creation Masters could achieve in healing a Bronze fey\u2019s damaged roots.The best methods for Creation Masters to earn money were evolving feys and enhancing their quality. In order to heal a fey\u2019s damaged roots, the Creation Master would have to use spiritual ingredients to assist in the recuperation. It would be wasting time and experience.At the same time, it might not be a 100% recovery.Thus, it was very hard to hire a top-class Creation Master to heal a fey\u2019s damaged roots without any special connections.A fey contract couldn\u2019t be changed, and if the fey\u2019s roots were damaged, it would be the same as damaging the potential of a spirit qi professional.As such, Creation Masters didn\u2019t just create hope for evolution, but they also created hope for rescue.The Revival Soil was a supporting ingredient that Lin Yuan was planning to use to nurture and enhance the Jasmine Lily\u2019s quality to Legend when it was bronze-grade. Such ingredients were extremely hard to find, and it required planning right now.The violent-tempered woman desperately thanked Lin Yuan upon hearing his request. He had given the most compassionate price by requesting for a bag of Revival Soil.Had she looked for another Class 2 Creation Master and offered this price, they would not even let her step through their door.Lin Yuan offered this price because he could effortlessly heal the fey\u2019s damaged root. It was even easier than to increase the fey\u2019s quality.Spiritual ingredients like the Revival Soil had the same status as Bronze Usneas and were extremely hard to find.Before this, Lin Yuan had already asked if Zhou Jiaxin had any Revival Soil, and unfortunately, she didn\u2019t. Hence, Lin Yuan wanted to see if this violent-tempered woman could obtain it.It would be best if she could. If she couldn\u2019t obtain it, Lin Yuan would change the price to Radiance dollars and wouldn\u2019t leave them for dead.The violent-tempered woman gritted her teeth and guaranteed that she would obtain a bag of Revival Soil. She then repeatedly thanked Lin Yuan, making him feel a little embarrassed.Suddenly, Lin Yuan thought that he could add the service of healing feys\u2019 damaged roots within his private custom jobs. It would definitely allow him to receive plenty of rare ingredients that no amount of Radiance dollars could buy.While thinking like this, Lin Yuan let out a sigh.I am not just lacking Radiance dollars. I also lack all sorts of rare ingredients.For the Jasmine Lily\u2019s quality to reach Legend, he would need a portion of Revival Soil, two Mahogany Tree Cores, and 1L of Grasswood Fountain Water.Presently, it could be considered that he had obtained the Revival Soil.The Grasswood Fountain Water was something that could be bought with a huge amount of Radiance dollars. However, Lin Yuan was still witless on how to obtain the two Mahogany Tree Cores.The Mahogany Tree Cores were treasures that were qualified to enter the Rare Lifeform Pavilion.It seems like my grand plan of earning money is still far from enough.When the violent-tempered woman walked out of Lin Yuan\u2019s store, she noticed that the short and fat Buddhism-inclined person who had angered her was standing at the entrance of the store.The violent-tempered woman immediately wiped off the tears on her face.The short Buddhism-inclined fatty had obviously heard the conversation in the store and wanted to console the violent-tempered woman.\u201cBuddha said\u2014\u201dWhen the violent tempered woman heard the words \u201cBuddha said\u201d, she gave a glare and yelled, \u201cBuddha said that all things have consequences, and your retribution is me!\u201dOnce Lin Yuan\u2019s peace and quiet returned, he sent the message to Stream in the Cloud on the Star Web.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cThe five Elite/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders are in the store now. Come over and take a look.\u201dStream in the Cloud: \u201cWhat? Uncle, you have already obtained five Elite/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders so quickly!? You aren\u2019t cheating me, right?\u201dDeep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cYou are so clever, who would dare to cheat you? Hurry up and come over so that I can deliver the goods to you.\u201dLin Yuan urgently needed to sell the five Elite/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders for 10 Radiance dollars. Once he received the money, he would then have the capital to nurture Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.Otherwise, Lin Yuan\u2019s current wealth wasn\u2019t enough to even purchase one Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, let alone nurturing anything.Stream in the Cloud: \u201cI understand, Uncle. I will be there right away!\u201dStream in the Cloud quickly arrived at Lin Yuan\u2019s store, and when she saw the five Elite/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders, she clicked her tongue in amazement and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think that you would actually be so fast! I am uber-lucky, and I will definitely be able to produce the Transparent Spider Web from these five Web-Spraying Spiders. Hurry up and deliver them to me!\u201dPreviously, it was Lin Yuan who had been anxious. However, he didn\u2019t expect Stream in the Cloud to be even more anxious than him after seeing the Web-Spraying Spiders. She was already asking him to expedite the delivery!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Make Itself Better for ConsumptionLin Yuan suddenly chuckled upon seeing Stream in the Cloud\u2019s excited expression and her shaking bumblebee hat.Naturally, Lin Yuan\u2019s chuckle infuriated Stream in the Cloud.\u201cYou are not allowed to laugh at this young lady\u2019s hair! I didn\u2019t want to be injured by the Ghost Shadow Bristled Spider either!\u201dAs she spoke, Stream in the Cloud took off her bumblebee hat and pointed at her head. \u201cTake a closer look at my hair! They are about to grow out fully!\u201dLin Yuan felt that Stream in the Cloud wasn\u2019t really a smart person.After logging out of the Star Web, Lin Yuan immediately contacted Ah Neng to make a delivery.Just like the last time, Ah Neng arrived quickly and helped Lin Yuan to store the five Elite/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders into the spirit storage boxes.Lin Yuan praised Ah Neng for her quick and efficient work.\u201cYour previous delivery of goods was amazing. You delivered everything within two hours. I shall give you a \u2018Like\u2019!\u201dLin Yuan knew that newcomers would always need some encouragement. It might be a simple statement of encouragement or very ordinary words, but it would subconsciously bring joy and delight for the other person.As expected, Ah Neng\u2019s face immediately revealed a shy smile, but it was glowing with vigor and high spirits.\u201cThank you, Mister Lin. I will continue to work hard!\u201dFor the past few days, Lin Yuan had been playing the game of rolling a snowball.The Spirit Lock spatial zone\u2019s spirit pool was nurturing batches of Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, and simultaneously Lin Yuan started to put Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish on the Star Web store for sale.Lin Yuan did think about setting a purchase limit and for each individual who visited the store to only purchase one Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. However, after deep contemplation, Lin Yuan rejected the idea.The price he set for the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish wasn\u2019t exactly low, and it was a realistic market price. Due to the same subspecies of Butterfly Telescope, Lin Yuan actually set the price slightly higher than the market price.Things that were rare would be expensive. Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish were rare feys, and a store would seldom sell them. It was needless to say about the Butterfly Telescope\u2014a subspecies that had the best appearance among the Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.Therefore, whenever Spirit-Siphon Goldfish appeared in his store, they would be immediately snatched up.Lin Yuan was thinking to leave it be since he wasn\u2019t making a loss. At the same time, such a selling method would actually increase the buyers\u2019 competitive spirit.Lin Yuan had purchased another 30 pots of Usneas. This time, he wasn\u2019t going to sell them after evolving them to elite-grade. He was going to evolve the Usneas all the way to bronze-grade.It had to be known that the evolution path of Bronze Usneas was truly bizarre.All other feys would enhance their survival or combat capabilities, but the Usnea would think of all methods to make itself better for consumption. It was no wonder they were known as herbivorous feys\u2019 super energy food.This effort for trying to make itself better for consumption was truly worthy for all production-type feys to study from\u2026As a production-type fey, the Usnea was definitely very successful.If it awakened the exclusive skill \u2018Thick Fibres\u2019 at bronze-grade, it would increase the digestion speed for herbivorous feys. It allowed the herbivorous feys to absorb the energy from the Usneas quickly and increase consumption speed. It would certainly be subtly increasing the speed of evolution.The exclusive skill \u2018Grayish Green Leaves\u2019 might make the Usnea\u2019s appearance unpleasant, but it would actually increase chlorophyll\u2019s content in the leaves. The chlorophyll increase subsequently increased the Usnea vines\u2019 nutritional value.All of the Usnea\u2019s exclusive skills were basically to make itself better for consumption or how to grow more vines to increase the vine production.In an exaggerated way, it felt as if the Usneas were telling all living things\u2014\u201dI am a food producer, and I am delicious! As such, you all have to take care of me and treat me well! Nurture me meticulously!\u201dWhen Lin Yuan evolved Usneas, he didn\u2019t really pay attention to the Usneas\u2019 quality as he would be concentrated on making the Usneas break through to bronze-grade.When an Elite Usnea broke through to bronze-grade, it felt as though Mother Nature had been meticulously caring for it for more than ten years. The leaves would grow by over twice in size, the vines would be longer, and the closer to the tip of the vine, the bigger the leaves.The leaves at the top portion would be especially fresh and tender as they didn\u2019t have time to grow into new leaves, making them particularly soft.Lin Yuan held the leaves at the bottom portion and immediately felt that the weight of the leaves was rather heavy. The vines that suspended down wouldn\u2019t be as greenish as before and would have a layer of wood-like shell.After using strength to break the outer shell, it would immediately ooze out with a richer and more nutritious sap.Lin Yuan always felt a magnificent scale of life evolution whenever he observed a fey transforming through evolution.Lin Yuan looked at the Bronze Usnea and asked Genius, \u201cGenius, if you had a choice, would you choose to evolve to become more delicious to escape danger?\u201dGenius purred and looked at Lin Yuan with a confused expression. Before it was going to recite the information on the Usnea\u2019s evolution it had memorized from the books, Lin Yuan added, \u201cIf it were me, I would evolve myself and make myself nastier, as nasty as possible.\u201dGenius turned its head to the side and looked at the handsome young man doubtfully.\u00a0Am I too smart? Causing me to look at Yuan and still feel that Yuan isn\u2019t very clever?As Genius was deep in thoughts, it was unaware that Chimey, which thought it was the smartest one, was singing with delight.Chimey watched as tens of thousands of fans appeared in its streaming room after just a few days, and it felt as though it was only its path to the pinnacle of birdlife.The screen was constantly flooded with the words \u2018Sparrow Voice Loli Goddess\u2019.After being busy for the past few days, Lin Yuan felt like going out for a walk by himself.In my previous life, I couldn\u2019t even stay in the house for a day. Why am I becoming more like a nerd in this life?After waking around the alleys twice, Lin Yuan decided to purchase a new set of clothes in the mall. He then sat in a restaurant in the mall and ordered a set meal.The set meal consisted of red braised meat, barbecued fish pieces, and a portion of rice.For a meat lover like Lin Yuan, vegetables had never been in his range of choices.After taking a bite of the red braised meat and the barbecued fish, Lin Yuan felt that the set meal here wasn\u2019t as nice as Uncle Li\u2019s cooking.I wonder how the treatment for Uncle Li\u2019s leg is? How long will Auntie Zhang and Uncle Li go for this time? Last year, it seemed like they were gone for three months before returning.The mall was playing the news. Most of the news outlets were reporting about the duels in the Star Web\u2019s Celestial Stairway and some of the incidents in the real world.Lin Yuan listened to the news while eating his set meal. He felt as though he had broken free from the busy days and was enjoying the rare serenity.This contented sensation made Lin Yuan feel very comfortable. It was also this contented sensation that wiped out the fatigue that had accumulated from days of endless work.However, all of a sudden, a news report made Lin Yuan\u2019s hand freeze.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Spirit GuardsAs the news was playing, the large screen in the mall also displayed a video with diagrams that corresponded with the broadcast.\u201cThe Radiance Federation\u2019s Creation Master Association will be conducting a change for the Creation Master exam.\u201d\u201cAnyone who can complete the Class 1 Creation Master exam within two hours will be exempted from the exams for three lifestyle-class occupations. They will be able to immediately enter the Class 2 Creation Master exam.\u201d\u201cThe current measures have yet to be fully generalized, and it will only be conducted under the supervision of Lordress Ling Xiao in Redbud City. The rest of the regions will be implemented with the measures concurrently.\u201dAlthough this was totally outside of Lin Yuan\u2019s expectation, it was certainly great news for him.Previously, I was only planning to become a Class 1 Creation Master. If I am able to complete the exam to become a Class 1 Creation Master within two hours, can I directly promote and become a class 2 Creation Master?For the three lifestyle-class occupations, be it the Scholar, Fey Observer, or Spiritual Ingredient Analyst, the knowledge content for Class 2 was entirely different from Class 1 content.Even with Genius\u2019 help, Lin Yuan would need to spend a huge effort and a lot of time to prepare.Presently, there was an opportunity to be exempted from taking the promotion exams for those three lifestyle-class occupations and taking a shortcut to becoming a Class 2 Creation Master. No matter what, Lin Yuan was going to strive for it.Before Lin Yuan could think more into it, another news report, which Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t normally care about, made him frown.\u201cRecently investigations from the Federation states that the dimensional rifts will be entering the active period in half a year.\u201d\u201cDuring the active period, the dimensional rift will erupt with alien beast waves. Therefore, the Radiance Federation will be entering a war preparation state from now on. We advise the Federation\u2019s citizens to also make preparations in advance and do not panic.\u201d\u201cThe Federation will be mobilizing Spirit Guards during the active period to assist defending against the alien beast waves.\u201dEver since Lin Yuan had arrived in this world, his sentience had been intact and clear. Even when he had an infant, his thoughts weren\u2019t like an infant\u2019s. Thus, he remembered everything that had happened from his infancy and onward.\u2018Active period of dimensional rift\u2019 were words that stung Lin Yuan deep inside. As for the reason they stung\u2026 Lin Yuan had lost his parents of this life in such an incident, and he had to struggle to survive with his younger sister.Lin Yuan clenched his hands tightly when he saw the crest that suddenly appeared on the mall\u2019s large screen. He had seen these crests before, and two of them were sitting inside his little store.These were the rare few remnants his parents had left behind. It was only now that Lin Yuan realized they were the Spirit Guards\u2019 insignia.Lin Yuan suddenly felt rather regretful as he truly knew too little about this world. He had only logged into the Star Web recently too.If he had tried to understand more of this world and that his parents\u2019 deaths were inevitable, he may also have found out how they had perished.Lin Yuan\u2019s thoughts return back to that rainy and pitch-black night. A dimensional rift had appeared at the Xia Region\u2019s outskirts, and countless alien beasts rushed out of it.The dimensional rift had opened up without any prior signs. At that time, his parents, who looked just like ordinary people, immediately sprinted toward the direction of the dimensional rift, and\u2026 they never returned afterward.After eating his meal, Lin Yuan carried his heavy thoughts and returned home.He logged into the Star Web and carefully checked the information on the dimensional rift that had erupted ten years ago, as well as on the Spirit Guards.Fortunately, the Star Web had records on the dimensional rift that had opened up in the Xia Region\u2019s outskirts. It was a Subterranean Dimensional Rift, and a massive number of subterranean lifeforms invaded the Xia Region. In addition, there were a Class 4 and a Class 5 alien beast among them.Class 4 alien beasts were equivalent to Platinum feys, while Class 5 alien beasts were equivalent to Diamond feys.Lin Yuan had already witnessed a Platinum Flowing Flame Giant Bear\u2019s prowess, so it was imaginable how much more destructive power a Diamond fey possessed.Lin Yuan read until the end. The article clearly stated the Spirit Guard members that had successfully defended the Xia Region. They had also wiped out Subterranean Dimensional Rift\u2019s beast waves and sealed up the rift.At that moment, Lin Yuan read another crucial point that caused his irises to contract.The Class 4 alien beast that had appeared from the Subterranean Dimensional Rift was the Marsh Dragon Musca. As for the Class 5 alien beast that hadn\u2019t appeared at the beginning of the beast wave, it was stated to be the Bone Rotting Filarial Worm.Lin Yuan immediately recalled Uncle Li\u2019s leg injury.Back when he had used True Data to check on Uncle Li\u2019s leg injury, it stated that it was inflicted with Bone Gangrene. The Bone Rotting Filarial Worm would only use Bone Gangrene when it was going to sacrifice itself to take its enemy with it.One could imagine how terrifying a Class 5 alien beast\u2019s sacrificial attack would be.After pondering for some time, Lin Yuan suddenly pinpointed some clues and realized something.From the looks of the situation, his parents should be members of the Spirit Guards. Lin Yuan felt his heart getting stuffy and urgently wished for Auntie Zhang and Uncle Li to return quickly. He wanted to ask what exactly had happened.Lin Yuan lay on the table for a long time before checking the information on the Spirit Guards carefully.He knew that this world was humongous. There were famous mountains, long rivers, massive lakes, and raging seas. Mountains and forests stretched across the lands. To the south of the federation was the Magma Zone, to the north was the Icebound Polar Region, to the west was the Desolate Desert, and to the east was the Mud Wetlands.In this massive world were countless feys, and naturally, there were good and bad ones.The Radiance Federation had a simple method to determine if the feys were good or bad. Those that were friendly toward humans and didn\u2019t destroy nature were good, while those that attacked humans and destroyed the environment were bad.The Spirit Guards were individuals that protected the Radiance Federation in all parts of the world and dealt with feys. They would eradicate bad-natured feys below platinum-grade lighting fast and make thorough preparation to deal with those above platinum-grade.After reading about the Spirit Guards and understanding how they contributed to the Radiance Federation with their strength, Lin Yuan felt he had a deeper understanding of his parents.In his eyes, his ordinary-looking parents were actually the unnamed heroes of this world.\u201cSpirit Guards.\u201dLin Yuan spoke of the words silently before returning to his room. Then, he took something out of the nightstand. It was a large box that contained two smaller red boxes.Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes felt sore when he opened and looked at the two small red boxes. They contained all the milk teeth that he and Chu Ci had dropped when they were young. Their parents had carefully collected them and stored them in the boxes.Their parents had told them they would bury the teeth when Lin Yuan and Chu Ci were ten years old in order to live a comfortable life. Unfortunately, after that night, they could no longer bury all the meticulously collected teeth in the soil\u2026Lin Yuan carefully picked up the two crests by the side of the boxes. While holding the two crests, they felt surprisingly light, but they somehow suppressed Lin Yuan\u2019s strength and made his hands shake.At that moment, Lin Yuan looked through the window and noticed that the lights\u2019 of the house opposite his store had suddenly lit up. At the same time, someone knocked on the door of his little store.Despite the case, Lin Yuan knew that the person knocking on the door wasn\u2019t Auntie Zhang. If it was Auntie Zhang, he would probably have heard her unique and friendly voice from far away.Who else could it be that is knocking at this time?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: Source SeedThe knocking sound constantly echoed. It had a steady rhythm that wasn\u2019t too gentle nor too harsh. However, Lin Yuan\u2019s heart was in disarray.It wasn\u2019t Auntie Zhang or Uncle Li that had lit up their house\u2019s lights. At the same time, someone was knocking on his door.Although Radiance Federation\u2019s public security might be great and Lin Yuan had never heard of any cruel incidents, he still hid a razor-sharp knife\u2014the one that he would use to cut off the Usnea vines\u2014in his sleeve.He also called out to Chimey softly and asked it to stand on his shoulder. He then walked toward the entrance and prepared to open the door.Before opening the door, Lin Yuan said softly, \u201cChimey, when I open the door later, and if I step back, it doesn\u2019t matter what is at the entrance. You just have to execute Turbulence and Sound Thrust at the door.\u201dUpon receiving Lin Yuan\u2019s command, Chimey became vigilant. It looked as though it was preparing to activate the attack as soon as Lin Yuan moved.There were cases of people knocking on Lin Yuan\u2019s door in the night, but it was unknown why he felt particularly nervous on this night.He finally learned about his parents\u2019 identities, and Auntie Zhang\u2019s house was lit up on the same day. All of these coincidences made Lin Yuan\u2019s senses abnormally sensitive.The knocking sound suddenly changed. Previously, it was a rhythmic sound that was neither gentle nor harsh. The knocking sound was slightly heavier now, and it stopped after two \u2018knock, knock\u2019.Lin Yuan frowned as he noticed that there wasn\u2019t just one person outside the door. There were at least two individuals.After opening the door, Lin Yuan spotted a man and a woman standing around one meter away from the door.The man looked like he was slightly over 30, while the woman looked a little younger.The man noticed Lin Yuan\u2019s tensed hand, which was gripping the hidden knife tightly in his sleeve.The woman\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change, but the 30-year-old man chuckled and said, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t be nervous. I just want to ask about the name of your parents.\u201dThe 30-year-old man asked again, \u201cAre your mother and father Chu Yan and Lin Jian?\u201dLin Yuan took a deep look at the man and the woman before nodding and replying, \u201cYes. May I ask what is the matter?\u201dWhen they heard his answer, Lin Yuan felt that the duo was looking at him differently. Their gaze became gentler and more amiable.The silent woman handed a letter to Lin Yuan. \u201cYour Auntie Zhang wrote this letter,\u201d she said.\u201cRead the letter first. After you finish, there is something else for you,\u201d she added.Lin Yuan opened the letter, and two things fell out.One of them was a piece of cloth.Lin Yuan opened up the cloth and felt that it was rather dirty. It was stained with grayish-black dirt, and there were actually two red-colored and rather ugly smiley faces.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know what to do with it, so he put it down and proceeded with reading the letter.Soon, Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes turned red, and a bean-sized tear dropped on the letter, mottling the ink on the paper.One drop, two drops, three drops\u2026Lin Yuan could no longer see the letter\u2019s content clearly.After his parents\u2019 death, Lin Yuan had never cried as he must stay strong to support the store and Chu Ci\u2019s hope.But now, thousands of emotions surged into his heart as the peaceful bliss of his childhood floated in front of his eyes.The commandment that stated a man\u2019s tears shouldn\u2019t drop so easily had been broken.Lin Yuan kept the letter and used his hands to wipe his eyes. Now that Lin Yuan was looking at that strange cloth, he felt that it was the warmest thing in this world.During the alien beast wave, his young parents had been severely injured, and at the crucial moment, they had torn off a piece of cloth and drawn two smiley faces with their fresh blood before death.It was unknown what the smiley faces signified. Nonetheless, Lin Yuan looked at the smiley faces and could imagine his parents\u2019 faces, which would always be smiling no matter what.The smiling faces might be expectations, concern, or an instinctive action that was carried out subconsciously.Lin Yuan solemnly folded the cloth and put it close to him. He then said to the duo that had been waiting silently for him to read the letter, \u201cThank you.\u201dThe man immediately got closer and patted Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder. \u201cWhat is there to thank? A person of your age can just call me Uncle Dong. Later on, I will leave behind my contact information. If you have any issues, you just have to look for me.\u201dUncle Dong was a chatterbox and pulled Lin Yuan closer before starting to inquire about his life.In regards to this sudden concern, Lin Yuan rubbed the back of his head and felt a little exhausted when dealing with it.All of a sudden, the woman coughed lightly, and Uncle Dong immediately stopped talking. He then turned around in embarrassment.\u201cLin Yuan, this is a gift from your Uncle Li.\u201dLin Yuan received the box and thanked her. The woman immediately shook her hand and said gently, \u201cJust call me Auntie Su.\u201dLin Yuan nodded and greeted her appropriately.At that moment, Uncle Dong was so shocked that his jaws nearly dropped. \u201cOld Su, I didn\u2019t think that you were a person with feelings!\u201d he exclaimed.Before he could finish, he received a cold glare and didn\u2019t dare to continue speaking.When Auntie Su noticed that Lin Yuan was going to keep the box, she said, \u201cOpen the box now and take a look inside. I will tell you what it is. It is something very precious.\u201dLin Yuan responded by opening the box and saw a sphere, which was the size of a big toe, embedded in the center of the box.Lin Yuan picked up the sphere and took a closer look but wasn\u2019t able to identify it. However, from its appearance, it looked like a dried-up plant\u2019s seed.\u201cIt was exchanged for the merits of your father, mother, Auntie Zhang, and Uncle Li. It is a Source Seed.\u201dLin Yuan felt a lashing pain in his heart first before a trace of warmth replaced it. \u201cAuntie Su, what is a Source Seed?\u201d he asked.Auntie Su didn\u2019t explain immediately. Instead, she asked Lin Yuan, \u201cDo you know how dimensional rifts are sealed?\u201dLin Yuan shook his head.\u201cA dimensional rift may produce an alien beast wave, but it is also a treasure trove. This Source Seed was extracted from a Class 2 dimensional rift. The opening of a dimensional rift produces source-type items. If one extracts the Source Seed, the dimensional rift will lose its ability to produce source-type items and close. There are all sorts of source-type items, and the Source Seed in your hand is one of them.\u201dLin Yuan observed the Source Seed but couldn\u2019t find anything special. It looked just like a piece of hardened lump that was dark green in color.\u201cThis Source Seed is very suitable for you. You cannot sense spirit qi and have weak spiritual energy, so you cannot form contracts with feys. This Source Seed only requires fresh blood to nurture it. In other words, it can form contracts with humans without the need for spirit qi and spiritual energy.\u201dFinally, Lin Yuan learned about the Source Seed\u2019s function!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: A Pack of Wolves HuntingSu Jin explained further upon seeing that Lin Yuan understood.\u201cThe Source Seed\u2019s evolution is different from regular feys. It is equivalent to a seed that you can mold as you wish. By feeding it, nurturing it, and guiding it, you can be certain of the Source Seed\u2019s ability and evolution direction. I advise you to nurture the Source Seed into a healing-type fey as it will be useful for your condition.\u201dLin Yuan had a good grasp of the Source Seed\u2019s function now.Simply put, this Source Seed was like an empty canvas. The Source Seed\u2019s owner could create willfully on the canvas and decide the Source Seed\u2019s evolution form, type, and ability.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t planning to nurture the Source Seed into a healing-type fey. On the contrary, he was planning to nurture it into a pure combat-class plant-type fey. That way, he would be able to protect himself at any time and place.In terms of combat, Lin Yuan had this insistence that he had to possess combat capabilities no matter what. Otherwise, if he became a pure Healer, he wouldn\u2019t be confident in protecting his life.Su Jin and Dong Hai gave Lin Yuan their contact information and told Lin Yuan to call them if there was any problem.Lin Yuan nodded in agreement out of courtesy. Based on Lin Yuan\u2019s personality, he would never seek help from others unless it was absolutely necessary.However, their kind intentions were something that Lin Yuan would remember in his heart.Auntie Su then took out another box and handed it to Lin Yuan. \u201cThis is my personal gift.\u201dLin Yuan opened it and saw that it was filled with Radiance dollars. It was unknown how many there were in the stack, but it was at least 100.Before Lin Yuan could say anything, Uncle Dong spoke unhappily. \u201cHey! Su Jin, didn\u2019t we say we will give it together? Why did you give it first without telling me?\u201dHe walked in front of Lin Yuan and took out a box smilingly. \u201cLittle Yuan, I also have a gift for you. Be it nurturing the Source Seed or supporting your younger sister at school, money is needed. Don\u2019t you save on it. Your Auntie Su and I will be giving you Radiance dollars every now and then.\u201dHe then stuffed the box into Lin Yuan\u2019s hand.Lin Yuan received it at first before he seriously latched the two boxes and returned them to Su Jin and Dong Hai.\u201cAuntie Su, Uncle Dong, I cannot accept the money.\u201dLin Yuan didn\u2019t explain much and just stood still with a smile. His eyes were filled with determination and sincerity.Dong Hai got anxious in response and tried to persuade him. \u201cLittle Yuan, keep them, be good.\u201d\u201cI feel that I cannot accept them.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need you to feel, I just need me to feel it is okay!\u201dLin Yuan suddenly didn\u2019t know what to say.\u00a0Why did this Uncle suddenly become so slippery[1]?Oil Alert!As Lin Yuan was speaking, Su Jin had been looking at his eyes.Su Jin was a member of the Spirit Guards that had seen life and death. She suddenly felt that this youth\u2019s eyes were actually clear, sincere, and genuine. From these eyes, she understood that no matter what they said today, Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t accept the money.\u201cDong Hai, enough! It is fine if Little Yuan doesn\u2019t want it.\u201dShe then took back to the two boxes from Lin Yuan. She kept one box to herself and tossed the other box to Dong Hai.She didn\u2019t forget to say to Dong Hai, \u201cDon\u2019t speak another word tonight.\u201dDong Hai felt wronged and closed his mouth in embarrassment.Lin Yuan realized that Dong Hai\u2019s temperament became very straightforward and wasn\u2019t as slippery as before.It seems like Auntie Su is an expert in eliminating oil!Su Jin suddenly changed the topic and said to Lin Yuan, \u201cThis time, a Class 1 dimensional rift appeared in Xia Region. It is connected with an insect world. As for now, there are still numerous alien insects in the rift\u2019s vicinity. I can bring you along to see a Spirit Guard\u2019s work. Do you wish to go?\u201dLin Yuan immediately agreed and said firmly, \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dDimensional rift, insect world, all these were things that Lin Yuan had never come in contact with before. However, it was inevitable to encounter these things in this world, so now that there was a chance, Lin Yuan naturally wanted to go.Moreover, Lin Yuan wanted to understand more about the Spirit Guards\u2019 work. It would also allow him to understand his parents\u2019 experiences as they had also been members of the Spirit Guards.Perhaps, there would be a day when Lin Yuan would venture into dimensional rifts alone.There wasn\u2019t a need to talk about the distant future. According to the news, the dimensional rifts would become active in another half a year, and alien beast waves would start to surge out from the dimensional rifts. By then, it would be something that he had to face.Now that someone was offering to let him understand things in advance, it was truly a great chance.Su Jin looked at Lin Yuan with approval and said to Dong Hai, \u201cLater on, you will clear the alien insects. I will protect Little Yuan.\u201dDong Hai\u2019s eyes immediately lit up, and he quickly nodded.Instead of acting as a bodyguard, fighting and clearing the alien insects was more fitting to Dong Hai\u2019s style.Su Jin circulated her spiritual energy and summoned her fey.A snow-white avian with a wingspan of ten meters and thick and soft feathers, which were pure white, appeared in the air. The talons under the body had a dazzling metallic luster.The avian\u2019s head was slightly different from regular birds. Regular birds had a smaller head, but Su Jin\u2019s contracted fey\u2019s head was close to a third of the body.Lin Yuan used True Data to check on this fey\u2019s information.[Fey Name]: Silk Feather Snowy Owl[Fey Species]: Conceal Feather genus/Snowy Owl subspecies[Fey Grade]: Platinum (8/10)[Fey Type]: Qi/Ice[Fey Quality]: FlawlessAbilities:[Feather Assault]: Use the wings to activate an extremely fast flap. At the same time, shoot out razor-sharp side feathers from the wings.[Feather Shield]: Use the body\u2019s thick feathers to put on a damage defense.[Snow Feather Thrust]: When shooting out cold-attribute feathers, the feathers will condense ice and execute a scattering attack.[Snow Walk]: The extremely cold air currents form a snow avalanche on the surface of the ground to execute a snowstorm and ice burying attack.[Protection of Snow]: Summon the power of extreme cold and condense hard ice to protect multiple targets and also to increase the resistance toward ice and snow.Exclusive Skill:[Rapid Cold]: Increase affinity with ice and frost, allowing all ice-type abilities to have the Rapid Cold effect.The Silk Feather Snowy Owl was a flying and defense-type fey. But just by looking at the Silk Feather Snowy Owl\u2019s talons, Lin Yuan knew that its attack power would definitely be extraordinary.After reaching platinum-grade, without the abilities and skill, the fey\u2019s physical body would already possess powerful damage output.Su Jin\u2019s Silk Feather Snowy Owl\u2019s exclusive skill and nurture method was leaning toward offense.It allowed this defense-type fey to have extraordinary defense and also outstanding offensive power.When the Silk Feather Snowy Owl appeared, Chimey was frightened, and Lin Yuan quickly comforted it. After comforting Chimey, Lin Yuan left Chimey at home.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t want to bring along Genius and Chimey as it wouldn\u2019t just be dangerous for them. At the same time, their extraordinary traits might be detected by Su Jin and Dong Hai. It wasn\u2019t something that Lin Yuan wanted.When Chimey evolved to bronze-grade, it wouldn\u2019t matter if Chimey evolved into the ancestry line or had a spiritual variation. Its looks would definitely undergo an extreme change. By then, people would no longer treat it as a Sound Bird.Under Su Jin\u2019s instructions, Lin Yuan climbed at the Silk Feather Snowy Owl\u2019s back.This was the first time Lin Yuan was observing a Platinum fey from such a close distance, and it was also his first time riding on a Platinum flying fey.He had to admit that the Silk Feather Snowy Owl was so cozy that it was absurd. When stepping on the Silk Feather Snowy Owl\u2019s back, Lin Yuan felt he was stepping on a bed weaved with goose feathers. It was an absolute enjoyment.When the Silk Feather Snowy Owl was flying in the sky, it was just like a floating cloud.In just a short moment, it flew out of the Xia Region and arrived at the vicinity of the dimensional rift.As soon as Lin Yuan got off the Silk Feather Snowy Owl\u2019s back, he could hear faint sounds from all sorts of alien insects on this black night. It felt just like the insatiable butcher that was hidden in the dark.At that moment, a part of uniformed personnel approached them. Su Jin handed her credentials and her crest. The uniformed personnel immediately saluted and left to patrol other places.By looking at the outfit of these people, Lin Yuan immediately recognized them as the Redbud City\u2019s famous Redbud Guards.It was said that each Redbud Guard possessed a Gold fey, and they were considered the core strength of the Redbud City.He didn\u2019t expect so many Redbud Guards to be in the vicinity of the Class 1 dimensional rift. As of now, Lin Yuan already encountered more than three platoons.Seeing Lin Yuan\u2019s confused expression, Su Jin patiently explained, \u201cThe Class 1 dimensional rift is connected to an insect world. It might only be Class 1, but the danger level isn\u2019t inferior to a Class 2 dimensional rift. The alien insects have strong reproductive abilities and can also evolve by eating their enemies. Their growth rate is extremely fast, so it is very hard to deal with them.\u201dAll of a sudden, Lin Yuan heard a frail sound from behind, and he immediately saw Dong Hai brandishing his fist at the back.An alien insect collapsed on the ground due to Dong Hai\u2019s fist, and the poisonous fluid in its body was spraying out. It was obvious that it wouldn\u2019t be able to survive.Dong Hai was extremely stern and serious as he informed, \u201cWe are almost reaching the dimensional rift. By then, Little Yuan will be able to see exactly how dangerous this dimensional rift is.\u201dSoon enough, Lin Yuan looked at the front and could see a black and red crack that stretched across nearly half the place.Inside the crack, he was able to vaguely see a wonderful world. From time to time, there would be some alien insects falling out of the crack.It was such a shocking sight that caused Lin Yuan\u2019s irises to contract.From the looks of it, around 100 alien insects would be falling out of the dimensional rift at every moment.It was unending and felt as though they were being forced out.At that moment, Dong Hai shouted to the front, \u201cSpirit Guard Dong Hai is requesting to lift the restriction on the dimensional rift to conduct a fundamental clean up!\u201dAn individual flew over immediately after Dong Hai\u2019s statement. After checking the credentials, the person started to give orders to the Redbud Guards that were guarding the dimensional rift\u2019s vicinity.Subsequently, Lin Yuan noticed a layer of faint obstruction under the dimensional rift had suddenly vanished. The dimensional rift felt as though it had ruptured, and all sorts of alien insects were rapidly gushing out.Su Jin stayed beside Lin Yuan and was constantly describing and explaining the knowledge in regards to the dimensional rift.\u201cLittle Yuan, there might be numerous alien insects bursting out of the dimensional rift, but most of these alien insects are elite-grade, and only the minority are bronze-grade. There are basically just a few silver-grade.\u201dLin Yuan said with shock, \u201cEven if that is the case, it will also take a long time to clean up, right?\u201dLin Yuan had never witnessed such situations, and it was even more shocking than those scenes in sci-fi films.Lin Yuan could hear Dong Hai speaking. \u201cLittle Yuan, I alone am enough to handle this small situation.\u201dThis statement made Lin Yuan feel that Dong Hai was emitting that indescribable aura again, as though he had drunk down big bowls of oil.Dong Hai snapped his fingers, and a Platinum fey appeared under his feet. It was a giant azure-blue wolf that was emitting a faint purple glow.Dong Hai extended his hands and brandished them as though he was a conductor and yelled out, \u201cSeek and hunt my wolves!\u201dThe azure-blue giant wolf suddenly flashed, and Lin Yuan realized there were countless wolves that revolved around him.The pack of wolves sprinted at the alien insects and started a hunting spree.Lin Yuan took a glance at the azure-blue giant wolf with True Data, and his irises contracted.[Fey Name]: Hidden Shadow Dire Wolf[Fey Species]: Dire Wolf species/Canis genus[Fey Grade]: Platinum (10/10)[Fey Type]: Dark[Fey Quality]: EpicAbilities:[Tear]: Use its fangs to tear up the prey and inflict penetrative damage.[Claw Attack]: Use its sharp claws to sweep at the enemy and also rip the target\u2019s flesh.[Terror Howl]: Let out a horrifying howl that terrorizes the enemy and lowers the enemy\u2019s defense capability.[Hidden Dark Wave]: The wolf\u2019s mouth emits an extremely destructive dark wave that is lethal within a short range.[Shadows of Myriad Wolf]: Possess the energy to produce clones. Produce shadow wolf clones that are weaker than the actual grade. The number of wolf shadows is determined by the energy allocation.Exclusive Skill:[Energy Extraction]: During the hunt, rapidly absorb energy from the prey to replenish energy.The Hidden Shadow Dire Wolf was nurtured into an utterly superior fey. The exclusive skill and abilities had the perfect combination.The clone wolf pack was able to hunt the alien insect to extract the energy and continue to split into more clones, forming a cycle that was to counter low-grade prey.This Hidden Shadow Dire Wolf was truly a killing machine meant to deal with low-grade alien insects.The Hidden Shadow Dire Wolf allowed Lin Yuan to have new knowledge on the evolution direction, exclusive skill, and abilities. It was the same as opening the door to a new world.Under the moon, the battle between the wolf pack and the alien insects was like an extremely beautiful flower of massacre that was blooming.However, Lin Yuan shook his head as he watched. Dong Hai, who was like a music conductor, revealed a handsome and charming man\u2019s expression. Especially the moment when Dong Hai spread out his arms, Lin Yuan\u2019s mind flashed with the words: A leap of apocalypse![2].Immediately after, Lin Yuan noticed an oil field that was as far as the horizon that had suddenly appeared![1] This is trying to describe a person that likes to brag[2] This is supposedly taking reference to a League of Legends\u2019 champion, Fiddlesticks\u2019 ultimate spellPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Red ThornUnder the chilly moonlight, a massacre commenced. Soon, the giant wolf that exuded a purple luster slaughtered all the alien insects.After the massacre, Dong Hai, Su Jin, and Lin Yuan departed, leaving behind a ground filled with insect corpses for the Redbud Guards to clean up.At that moment, an unassuming black crow was standing on a tree branch quietly and watching the insect corpses scattered throughout the ground.The crow\u2019s eyes betrayed its ruthlessness and viciousness, as well as traces of disdain.After standing quietly for a moment, the black crow flew straight for the dimensional rift with a burst of speed.\u2026When Lin Yuan returned, he realized he had obtained another Willpower Rune.Aren\u2019t Willpower Runes very difficult to obtain? Why does it seem like I am able to obtain them easily? Is it because I am too smart?\u00a0Lin Yuan ridiculed in his heart.Lin Yuan comprehended this Willpower Rune while witnessing the alien insects getting slaughtered. The slaughterfest represented destruction, but it brought hope to Xia Region\u2019s people.Destruction and hope were always contradicting or intersecting with each other. However, in different circumstances, hope and destruction had a different significance.This Willpower Rune represented hope that was released during the massacre, and it was a true offense-type rune.As for the Source Seed, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t use it immediately after returning. Instead, he spent quite a fair amount of money on the Star Web to purchase Source Seed-related books.Unfortunately, he realized that all those books were only giving simple introductions. They introduced the Source Seed as a kind of source-type item but only briefly mentioned its usage.There might be plenty of active dimensional rifts and many dimensional rifts that had been sealed and destroyed, but among all sorts of source-type items, there were only two Source Seeds had ever been obtained.The owner of the other Source Seed mentioned that one drop of fresh blood was enough to form a contract with the Source Seed. Afterward, they should bury the Source Seed in energy ores and just wait quietly for it to germinate.Not long after, because the person who had obtained the Source Seed had only been an ordinary person, he had perished during a calamitous Class 3 dimensional rift.As such, the research on Source Seeds had reached an end. The research result determined that Source Seeds were considered weaker among the source-type items.Otherwise, no matter how many merits and contributions Lin Yuan\u2019s parents, Uncle Li, or Auntie Zhang had wouldn\u2019t matter. It would be impossible for them to exchange for the only remaining Source Seed.After reading all the books on Source Seeds, Lin Yuan had a greater understanding of his Source Seed.Concurrently, Lin Yuan also decided to form a contract with the Source Seed. He took out the wrinkly Source Seed and observed it, feeling that it was nothing special.While observing the ordinary-looking Source Seed, Lin Yuan suddenly caught a glimpse of four hearts that were boiling with warmth.Lin Yuan made a cut on his finger and squeezed out a drop of fresh blood. The drop landed on the Source Seed, and he noticed that the seed absorbed it at breakneck speed. At the same time, he realized that the bloodline contract between him and the Source Seed had already formed!Since the contract was formed, Lin Yuan decided to stop the bleeding. However, before he could do that, another drop of blood fell on the Source Seed.Just as Lin Yuan was preparing to wipe off the blood, he discovered that the Source Seed had completely absorbed the drop of blood.Surprisingly, Lin Yuan felt that his connection with the Source Seed had deepened. Thus, he simply allowed his blood to drip onto the Source Seed.After six drops of blood, Lin Yuan could vaguely feel the Source Seed\u2019s emotional state. It was now emitting a desire for its contractor\u2019s blood.Naturally, Lin Yuan that the Source Seed-related books he had purchased on the Star Web had discrepancies. Logically speaking, the books\u2019 authors must have taken reference from the previous contractor\u2019s experience of dripping one drop of blood on the Source Seed and the fact that he had sensed that his connection had stopped.Lin Yuan could sense the Source Seed\u2019s desire. Thus, he bit on his hand, opening up the wound, and a surging flow of blood bespattered the Source Seed, which fearlessly absorbed the blood.After one minute of continuous blood loss, and when Lin Yuan felt a spell of dizziness, the Source Seed finally stopped its wanton absorption.Lin Yuan swiftly used his Jasmine Lily to heal himself. The Jasmine Lily\u2019s Heal ability might not be able to immediately heal Lin Yuan\u2019s wound, but in just a few seconds, the bleeding had stopped.An Elite X Jasmine Lily was already considered a full-fledged healing-type fey.Lin Yuan took a closer look at the Source Seed and noticed that it was gradually shedding off the hard scab on its surface. The layer of hard scab was now soft and dark red in color.The dark-red scab was withdrawn inside the Source Seed, and its front grew out soft sprouts that were around 3cm in height.At that moment, Lin Yuan could clearly feel that the Source Seed was waiting for his instruction to decide on its evolution direction and form.Lin Yuan had already made a plan regarding the Source Seed\u2019s evolution direction, so he immediately instructed, \u201cYou will follow the carnivorous plants\u2019 path, and your two soft sprouts will grow into a mouth!\u201dLin Yuan would first nurture the Source Seed into a predator plant and then evolve it toward the other directions.After receiving Lin Yuan\u2019s instructions, the Source Seed\u2019s soft sprouts went through a drastic transformation and turned into two cylinder-shaped stems that were 40cm in height.The stem\u2019s center was like a stomach sack, and when Lin Yuan touched it, it felt like it was hollow. The top of the stems were two red-colored multiflora roses.Lin Yuan took a closer look at the flowers. Although they might be like simple multiflora roses, their petals had sharp barbs. The moment the petals were rolled open, a saw-toothed mouth appeared.Lin Yuan never expected that a single command would allow the Source Seed to evolve a completed predator organ. Truth be told, it seemed like the Source Seed was as weak as stated in the books. However, Lin Yuan felt that the Source Seed was exceptionally strong, and it wasn\u2019t even at normal-grade yet!In addition, Lin Yuan even speculated that a Normal offense-type fey, such as the Gray Fur Hound, wouldn\u2019t be the Source Seed\u2019s match and would become its food source instead.Lin Yuan channeled the spirit qi into the Source Seed, but it didn\u2019t absorb the channeled spirit qi to his surprise.It seemed like the information was correct, and the only method to evolve the Source Seed was through energy absorption.As a combat-class plant, Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t going to allow the Source Seed to be absorbing energy from the soil as the main source of energy. If the plant was too reliant on the soil, it would suffer more restrictions in combat.Currently, the Source Seed could consume food to increase its energy and allow itself to evolve. As such, it didn\u2019t have to rely on its roots to absorb energy.Lin Yuan was planning to make the roots undergo a different transformation. He wouldn\u2019t forbid the roots to absorb energy from the soil. He would make the roots less reliant on absorbing energy from the soil and turn it into a method instead.For example, he would allow the Source Seed to instantly absorb the soil\u2019s energy to recuperate its body or enhance the roots\u2019 defensive ability.Of course, these were all ideas that Lin Yuan had just thought of. As for the exact evolution path, Lin Yuan would make a careful decision after evolving it to bronze-grade and choosing its exclusive skill.Lin Yuan looked at the Source Seed and decided to give it a name\u2014Red Thorn!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Mouth of RelinquishFrom now on, Lin Yuan would need to supply food to Red Thorn as he did for Genius and Chimey.Lin Yuan had already come to a decision about Red Thorn food supply. What else could be more suitable than the alien insects as a food source for Red Thorn?The alien insects had hard shells, while their flesh had corrosive properties.If these alien insects were used to feed Red Thorn, they would increase Red Thorn\u2019s digestive ability and allow Red Thorn\u2019s predator organs to produce a potent corrosive fluid in order to digest them.The alien insects were products of the dimensional rift and insect world. They weren\u2019t available in this world.On the Star Web, the carcasses of alien insects were sold as spiritual ingredients. Lin Yuan immediately went to purchase insect carcasses for Red Thorn to see how many of them it had to digest before reaching normal-grade.After entering his Star Web store, Lin Yuan noticed that plenty of people were waiting inside. There were many new faces, but Lin Yuan didn\u2019t feel strange toward their intentions as they were all waiting for him. They probably wanted to order Bronze Usneas and Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.These people were actually willing to increase the price to make orders with him, but Lin Yuan rejected all of them without exception.When operating a small store, especially a small fey store on the Star Web, apart from the selling feys, the store would be accepting private orders. Each private order would be different from the previous one, so the price would be different. However, as far as the store\u2019s normal fey were concerned, Lin Yuan chose to treat everyone fairly.Lin Yuan hadn\u2019t known how to operate a store in his previous life. He had accumulated all the knowledge for operating a store in this life by watching how his parents acted.Enthusiasm and perseverance were required when opening a store. Lin Yuan had already inherited the enthusiasm and perseverance traits and wouldn\u2019t change so easily.\u201cOwner, I wish to order 30 pots of Bronze Usneas at a price higher than the market price.\u201d\u201cOwner, I wish to order 100 Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish from you. I wonder if we can have a discussion.\u201dLin Yuan was rather tempted after hearing the offers, but he firmly rejected them.\u201cWhen the store brings new merchandise, you are all welcomed to snatch them.\u201dAfter sending these people away with a smile, Lin Yuan sighed.Due to the increase in transactions on the Star Web, there would always be new customers, and the usefulness of the AI robot would start to decrease. Lin Yuan really wanted to hire a staff member for his Star Web store.After the passage of a dozen days or so, Lin Yuan\u2019s store was no longer unknown as in the beginning. He had constantly been selling feys that were rarely available on the Star Web. As such, his store had been categorized by the Star Web as a Premium Goods Store.Naturally, since his store carried the Premium Goods Store title, it received yet another boost in popularity. Nonetheless, with more people visiting due to its reputation, Lin Yuan\u2019s supply of goods was not enough for the demand.Many Star Web stores were trying to think of methods to sell their goods, but Lin Yuan\u2019s store would only have available stock for ten minutes before selling out.During this period of time, the Bronze Usneas and Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish had brought Lin Yuan a profit of 400 Radiance dollars. In other words, Lin Yuan had already accumulated enough money to purchase three drops of gold-grade dragon blood.There were still a few days before the 27th, and Lin Yuan would definitely be able to earn more Radiance dollars during this period of time. He would then have the capital to purchase the great feys that people might miss out on.In Lin Yuan\u2019s case, who was urgently trying to increase his strength, no amount of Radiance dollars was enough to spend.Lin Yuan only had one Willpower Rune in the past, and he was already under great pressure. He was in a hurry to help his Jasmine Lily increase its quality to Legend at bronze-grade. From there, he would enhance it into a Fantasy Breed.Now that he had another Willpower Rune, Lin Yuan was already thinking of upgrading Red Thorn to become a Fantasy Breed at bronze-grade too.Red Thorn wasn\u2019t a regular fey that Lin Yuan could channel his spirit qi to evolve it and enhance its quality. Red Thorn would require the full support of resources, making it a sweet burden.Just as Lin Yuan was preparing to contact Zhou Jiaxin, he saw a message from a friend. He took a glance and couldn\u2019t help but lament.Stream in the Cloud is really not an uber lucky person. She even said she would definitely be able to roll out the Transparent Spider Web.To think about it, how can a person who got bitten by a Ghost Shadow Bristled Spider be uber lucky?As such, Lin Yuan had to continue preparing five more Elite X/Epic Web-Spraying Spiders for the Stream in the Cloud. It wasn\u2019t a problem for Lin Yuan as he considered an easy task to complete.After replying to the Stream in the Cloud, Lin Yuan contacted Zhou Jiaxin.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cBig Sister Xin, do you have any alien insect carcasses for sale?\u201dZhou Jiaxin: \u201cI do have low-grade alien insect carcasses and quite the collection at that. Do you need them? If you don\u2019t need too many, I can send them to you as a gift.\u201dZhou Jiaxin was rather surprised and didn\u2019t know why Lin Yuan wanted to purchase alien insect carcasses. Although the alien insect carcasses\u2019 prices weren\u2019t considered low, Zhou Jiaxin was willing to gift them because she wanted to build a better relationship with Lin Yuan.This was also considered a method to enhance the relationship with customers.Another factor was the recent dimensional rifts opening in various places; the alien insect carcasses\u2019 prices had plummeted.Since the alien insect carcasses\u2019 prices had declined, Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t mind giving away three or four of them.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cBig Sister Xin, there is no need for the gift. I will need a huge quantity of alien insect carcasses in the future. This time, I will need 100. I will also need another 10,000 catties of inferior energy ores, half a catty of Butterfly Shells, 40 Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, and five Elite X/Flawless Web-Spraying Spiders.\u201dLin Yuan decided to just purchase everything from Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store. After purchasing so many spiritual ingredients and feys from Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store, he didn\u2019t have to worry about the quality.Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t expect Lin Yuan to purchase so many goods in one go. She found the constant increase of Lin Yuan\u2019s purchasing power truly delightful. At the same time, she already treated Lin Yuan as her VIP customer and would open up all spiritual ingredients and resources from the store to Lin Yuan.As a Class 3 store owner, Zhou Jiaxin had plenty of collections. Those precious spiritual ingredients and feys were all resources to build ties with customers. As such, Zhou Jiaxin had been cautiously using them.However, Zhou Jiaxin was going to be extremely generous in offering her resources to Lin Yuan in the future. Of course, the precondition was that Lin Yuan could afford them.After logging out of the Star Web, Lin Yuan quickly received Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s goods. The 100 alien insect carcasses were stored in Ostrich Logistics spirit storage boxes, so there wasn\u2019t a need to worry they might rot.Lin Yuan tossed the alien insect carcasses to Red Thorn.Red Thorn probed and sensed the alien insect carcasses\u2019 taste before the two red flowers opened up and formed a red basin mouth that could fit a basketball. It then gobbled up two of the alien insect carcasses.Red Thorn\u2019s digestion speed of the alien insect carcasses was surprisingly fast, and it took just five to six minutes to disintegrate them.Lin Yuan continued to feed Red Thorn until the 80th carcass. When Red Thorn finished digesting the 80th alien insect carcass, it stopped eating.Its body started to shiver violently as it evolved and produced other body structures.At that moment, Lin Yuan checked on Red Thorn\u2019s normal-grade ability, and his irises shrunk as it was the Mouth of Relinquish!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Thousand Questions BeastRed Thorn\u2019s body was shivering with increased intensity. As it shivered, thorns started to grow out of Red Thorn\u2019s body. There were around ten thorns, around one and a half meters, with sharp spikes covering them.The spikes weren\u2019t ordinary spikes as they curved in a reverse direction. If this thorn pierced into the flesh, a slight pull of the vine would rip off the flesh.While looking at Red Thorn\u2019s normal-grade state, Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but get amazed by Red Thorn\u2019s offensive capability.Red Thorn\u2019s evolution felt as though it was meant for combat, but the evolution had yet to complete.At the center of Red Thorn, there was a fruit-shaped part that suddenly grew out. It was light red in color and around half a meter in height. As compared to the two digestive organs by the side, the fruit-shaped part was taller and much more robust.The two digestive organs that Red Thorn produced previously were gradually integrating with the fruit-shaped part. Red Thorn\u2019s evolution stopped here.Lin Yuan checked on Red Thorn\u2019s True Data.[Fey Name]: Red Thorn (Predator Plant)[Fey Species]: Rafflesia genus/Vine subspecies[Fey Grade]: Normal[Fey Type]: Source[Fey Quality]: EliteAbilities:[Mouth of Relinquish]: Secrete vigorous digestive fluids with powerful corrosive properties, allowing a faster speed to absorb the energy in the food.Red Thorn looked rather sinister and fearsome right now, however, Lin Yuan paid more attention to the newly grown fruit-shaped part as it was a new organ.This new organ was precisely due to the Red Thorn\u2019s normal-grade ability, Mouth of Relinquish.Red Thorn\u2019s digestive organs could only be described as complete before, but they were considered perfect right now.A single command from Lin Yuan had allowed Red Thorn to evolve into a nearly perfect route at the normal-grade. The newly grown organ was a digestive smelter. It allowed the digestive organs to dissolve the alien insect carcasses with extreme speed and also secrete large amounts of plant corrosive fluid.The corrosive plant fluid wasn\u2019t just able to help with the digestion of food, but the two multiflora flowers could also spat it out as an attack.Lin Yuan followed up quickly and continued to feed the alien insect carcasses. He noticed the Mouth of Relinquish had opened up multiple crevices that were filled with sharp teeth.Lin Yuan tossed ten insect carcasses into the Mouth of Relinquish, and it merely wriggled a few times before crushing all the insect carcasses.Due to the digestive fluids that were even more powerful than acid, it took just a few minutes to digest everything.Lin Yuan was shocked by Red Thorn\u2019s digestion speed.However, he wasn\u2019t hesitant and immediately ordered another 3,000 alien insect carcasses from Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s Star Web store. Lin Yuan was planning to constantly feed Red Thorn and for it to digest the alien insect carcasses to quickly reach elite-grade.Apart from listing up the new goods on the Star Web, Lin Yuan would be purchasing resources during this period. At the same time, he helped Stream in the Cloud to finish the custom orders.For the rest of the time, Lin Yuan had constantly been enhancing the Jasmine Lily, Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, Genius, and Chimey.It had to be known that regarding the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, Lin Yuan truly had a love-hate relationship with it.But as his spirit-locked fey, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have any choice and had to be patient as he increased the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s grade and quality. As for the other Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have the time to bother with them.However, due to the Spirit Lock spatial zone\u2019s ample spirit qi, the Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish in the spirit pool were all evolving rather quickly.Naturally, evolving the Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to elite-grade brought the main bulk of revenue for Lin Yuan.Days passed by, and Lin Yuan continued to operate Purchase With No Loss Fey Store. The small financial snowball had been constantly pushed by Lin Yuan and started to accumulate more snow, producing great rewards.At that moment, Chimey and Genius were cuddling with Lin Yuan. Under Lin Yuan\u2019s nourishment and channeled spirit qi, they were already Elite X/Epic feys.When Lin Yuan circulated the spirit qi to break through the limits in Genius and Chimey\u2019s bodies, the two of them simultaneously evolved to bronze-grade.Genius\u2019 body emitted the sound of intense bone formations, and it was meowing and purring as though it was experiencing extreme pain.The evolution to bronze-grade was considered a metamorphosis for any fey, and naturally, Genius was no exception. However, as a Hundred Questions Beast, Genius\u2019 foundation was much weaker than regular feys. Therefore, the evolution to bronze-grade was even more intense for Genius.In a few short minutes, Genius\u2019 fur had been withering and falling off layer by layer and growing new fur layer by layer. When Genius had reached elite-grade, it had already been the size of an adult domestic cat. Now that it evolved to bronze-grade, Genius actually shrunk by more than two times. Genius now had the size that was the same as the time before any evolution.Genius\u2019 fur had constantly been transforming, and after a period of time, it finally stopped. Genius\u2019 fur was completely white right now. But it wasn\u2019t white like the snow, but more like white nephrite that was sparkling and moist looking.Genius opened its eyes, and Lin Yuan noticed that its eyes were like amber and felt they were absurdly quick-witted.After waking up, Genius looked at its transformation and licked its little paws happily. All of a sudden, Genius looked at its tail and let out an alarmed meow.Lin Yuan looked over and noticed that Genius\u2019 tail had transformed from one into three. When Lin Yuan used True Data to check on Genius\u2019 attributes, he noticed that Genius\u2019 name had changed from a Hundred Questions Beast to a Thousand Questions Beast.Genius was still panicking because of its three tails. It used its little paw to grasp the tails and shook them back and forth. It made Genius\u2019 quick-witted eyes lit up.Since Genius evolved to bronze-grade with Epic quality, three exclusive skills appeared, and Lin Yuan had to make a choice.Lin Yuan carried Genius and discovered that its fur was ridiculously silky and soft. When Genius sensed that it had shrunk in size, it scuttled onto Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder and sat on its favorite spot.Lin Yuan read Genius\u2019 three exclusive skills and started to ponder.[Dust Avoidance]: All dust will be repelled, and the environment will be free of dust.[Tool Transformation]: Capable of transforming into a tool for the contractor to use.[Deepened Pain]: After attacking the target, it will cause the target to feel pain. Make use of the spiritual energy to decide and increase the pain.The three exclusive skills made Lin Yuan frown.Dust Avoidance was an exclusive skill that was like a smart vacuum cleaner and was very fitting for a housekeeping beast. If the Dust Avoidance skill was used in appropriate situations, it could be used to deal with and counter feys with Sandy Soil abilities.However, Genius wasn\u2019t an offense-type fey, so the effects in battle would be very limited.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Streamcloud Azure BirdDeepened Pain was also an exclusive skill of the same category. It was considered an elite combat-class exclusive skill that had horrific lethality in combat. But for Genius, it was obviously useless.Genius\u2019 physical body might obtain offensive capabilities as it continued to evolve, but it was unrealistic if Genius had to injure feys of the same grade.Genius was all in all a housekeeping or domestic fey.As for the Tool Transformation skill, Lin Yuan also had a headache. It was a skill that people would either love or hate.Only gamblers would prefer to use Tool Transformation as entertainment. According to different fey species, the Tool Transformation would be slightly different.However, it still couldn\u2019t lower the unpredictability of Tool Transformation.A huge and burly man had once picked the Tool Transformation skill for his fey, and the fey transformed into\u2026 a colorful and beautiful little hand-held fan. The scene had been so \u2018beautiful\u2019 that people couldn\u2019t bear watching.A delicate and petite little girl\u2019s fey had also awakened Tool Transformation, and it transformed into\u2026 a large steel hammer. It had angered the little girl so much that she could only wipe her tears and couldn\u2019t even cry out loud.If Tool Transformation gave out a weapon, it was rather good. But if it was a defense item, it was horrendous.Spirit qi clothes might be expensive now, but it was still possible to purchase them. If a fey transformed into a defense item, it was the same as losing a reliable helper in combat. But if they didn\u2019t use the exclusive skill, it was the same as the fey having one less exclusive skill.Furthermore, there were successful cases of Tool Transformation, and such cases were rather common.Since it was a matter with regards to one\u2019s fey, and there was only one chance, who would dare to take the risk?For people whose feys evolved with Flawless quality, they didn\u2019t have a chance. Now that Lin Yuan had three choices, he wasn\u2019t really willing to take the risk.However, the two other exclusive skills were truly useless for Genius, and it wasn\u2019t going to help to have them.Finally, Lin Yuan steeled his heart and decided to take the risk. If he made this bet, there was a possibility that a motorcycle might turn into a sports car, and if he failed, the motorcycle would turn into a bicycle at worst.As compared to the two other exclusive skills, the difference wasn\u2019t that much.Once Lin Yuan chose Tool Transformation, Genius let out a meow, and its body glowed and started to transform. Subsequently, it transformed into a classic white-framed pair of glasses. The glasses had amber-like decorations and looked just like Genius.When having a fey with Tool Transformation, there would certainly be an additional effect for the contractor. After wearing the glasses, Lin Yuan felt that his mind had obtained knowledge that he couldn\u2019t understand previously.This knowledge was mostly for primary rank Scholar, Fey Observer, and Spiritual Ingredient Analyst.Lin Yuan immediately understood. It seemed like when he wore the glasses, he could actually share the knowledge that Genius had learned.When Lin Yuan moved the glasses, he realized that the glasses had a second form. There was a switch at the back of the ear, which immediately turned the glasses into a white mask with amber patterns. Lin Yuan felt it was refreshing as Genius reverted to its original appearance after transforming twice.When Genius evolved from a Hundred Questions Beast to a Thousand Questions Beast, it was such a complete transformation that Lin Yuan would never have expected.If Genius wasn\u2019t able to use Tool Transformation and turn into a pair of glasses, Lin Yuan felt that it would be rather awkward to bring Genius into the exams for the lifestyle-class occupations.After checking on Genius\u2019 attributes after evolving to bronze-grade, Lin Yuan nodded.[Fey Name]: Thousand Questions Beast[Fey Species]: Spirit Cat species/Intelligent Cat species[Fey Grade]: Bronze (1/10)[Fey Type]: Spiritual[Fey Quality]: NormalAbilities:[Precise Memory]: When memorizing something, every single detail can be memorized with precision.[Knowledge Analysis]: Can conduct a diverse initial analysis of the memory\u2019s knowledge.Exclusive Skill:[Tool Transformation]: Capable of transforming into a tool for the contractor to use.After Genius\u2019 evolution, Chimey had also completed its evolution.The azure blue feathers on Chimey looked to have a layered effect like the different tones of blue in the clear blue sky. Its size didn\u2019t have an obvious change, but as compared to before, it looked more exquisite.The cloud patterns that weren\u2019t as distinct previously were now very distinct. The cloud patterns were clear, and the color had a metallic luster, just like a blue color from an artwork using the cloisonn\u00e9.Chimey\u2019s fey name was no longer Sound Bird. Instead, it was called Streamcloud Azure Bird now.As for Chimey\u2019s exclusive skill, Lin Yuan was very decisive.[Oily Feather]: The feathers secrete oil and can help to repel damage effectively.[Clear Sky]: After a chirp, the clouds will disperse and clear up the sky.[Wind Loan]: When flying, reduces stamina consumption and borrows the power of air currents effectively.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t hesitate after checking the three exclusive skills and immediately picked Clear Sky. It was an exclusive skill that Lin Yuan had never heard of. The effects of Clear Sky sounded like a water evasion ability, but if one was to exaggerate it, it was also able to change the weather.Most importantly, after using Clear Sky, Chimey would be facing the sun directly. Would Chimey be able to make use of the exclusive skill, Clear Sky, to comprehend the mysteriousness of the scorching sun? It might allow Chimey to have an opportunity to advance toward a higher bloodline.Lin Yuan checked on Chimey\u2019s True Data.[Fey Name]: Streamcloud Azure Bird[Fey Species]: Corvidae species/Azure Bird species[Fey Grade]: Bronze (1/10)[Fey Type]: Sound/Qi[Fey Quality]: NormalAbilities:[Sound Thrust]: Fire a sharp spike that is formed by sound at a designated target.[Turbulence]: The flap of the wings emits a consistently fast and random flow of air current.Exclusive Skill:[Clear Sky]: After a chirp, the clouds will disperse and clear up the sky.From the information displayed on True Data, Chimey\u2019s basic ability had also obtained a slight upgrade. It was now capable of being a combat-class fey.Chimey and Genius\u2019 evolutions to bronze-grade were all toward spiritual variations. Their sizes didn\u2019t get bigger, but they became comprehensive.Lin Yuan had also evolved the Jasmine Lily from Elite X/Epic to Bronze/Normal.Among the three exclusive skills, Lin Yuan repeatedly considered and finally picked the skill, Recovery Imprint.After picking Recovery Imprint, an imprint that was just like the Jasmine Lily appeared on Lin Yuan\u2019s forehead. He could feel that the imprint was constantly storing the healing energy released by the Jasmine Lily.This imprint was just like a lock that would seal all of the healing energy that was constantly released from the Jasmine Lily. When Lin Yuan opened up the lock, all of the accumulated healing energy would be immediately released.The Jasmine Lily\u2019s basic ability, Heal, had also changed after reaching bronze-grade. It wasn\u2019t a single target healing ability anymore. Depending on the spirit qi and the contractor\u2019s target, it could heal multiple targets until the contractor\u2019s spirit qi was fully exhausted.The change of the ability was also one of the reasons why Lin Yuan had chosen Recovery Imprint as the exclusive skill. When releasing the healing energy accumulated in the Recovery Imprint, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have to exhaust his own spiritual power.As for the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, it was now already Elite VII/Epic. The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s evolution speed had forcefully imbued Lin Yuan with patience.In addition, Lin Yuan still required the gold-grade dragon blood to incite the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s ancestry bloodline, so he wasn\u2019t in a hurry.Lin Yuan\u2019s strength had undergone a qualitative leap.Red Thorn was still rapidly digesting the alien insect carcasses and evolving toward elite-grade. Lin Yuan believed that Red Thorn would soon evolve to elite-grade and even bronze-grade with a massive amount of resources. By then, Lin Yuan\u2019s combat strength would increase significantly.Lin Yuan was in a hurry to increase his strength as he wanted to climb the Star Tower in the Star Web.Lin Yuan had already brought Chimey and Genius into the Star Web, and now, they were heading for the Star Tower.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Duels When Climbing the TowerThe most popular place in the Star Web would always be the Star Tower. At the Star Tower\u2019s vicinity, one would be able to feel how prosperous the Star Web was as the Radiance Federation\u2019s second world.After reaching the Star Tower\u2019s entrance, Lin Yuan was amazed by the things he saw and heard along the way. He saw all sorts of feys. They were all copied and uploaded data in the Star Web, but the high-grade feys retained their genuine prowess, giving off a pressure that blasted one right in the face.In order to climb the Star Tower, one would need to register first. Of course, it wasn\u2019t necessary to register every time before climbing the tower. Everyone would only have to register their information for the first time they climbed the tower.The most important objective for registering their information was to enter the spirit qi professionals\u2019 rank and the contracted feys\u2019 strength.Subsequently, the information would produce the data, and when challenging the tower, the data would produce a virtual image.In the real world, it was very difficult for spirit qi professionals to fight without any restraint. An all-out fight might result in one of the parties getting injured, or it might actually result in both parties being injured.When high-ranked spirit qi professionals were fighting at their full strength, they might not be able to control the damage their feys caused and might even result in casualties.The Star Web just so happened to compensate for this factor.A fight in the Star Web was the same as recording all the spirit qi professionals\u2019 information and the feys. During combat, the sense of pain, touch, and everything else would be the same as in the real world.Even if there were any casualties in the Star Web during combat, the spirit qi professionals and their feys in the real world wouldn\u2019t receive physical damage.The significance of climbing the Star Tower brought glory to the people at the high rankings and enabled spirit qi professional and their feys to work on their teamwork. It also gave them the chance to try combat techniques.For the first 100 floors of the Star Tower, challengers would be randomly picked on the same floor for combat. The winner would rise up by one floor, while the loser would drop down by one floor.After reaching the 100th floor, one would need to go through the Celestial Stairway Tribulation, which was also known as the promotion duels.During the promotion duel, three challengers that were participating in the promotion would be randomly picked to conduct three duels.After two consecutive duels, the third duel could be skipped, and the challenger would promote to the Celestial Stairway.If the challenger lost one duel, the promotion to the Celestial Stairway would fail. If the challenger lost two duels, the challenger wouldn\u2019t even be able to stay on the 100th floor and would drop down to the 99th floor.If the challenger lost three duels, they would drop directly to the 98th floor and would need to climb back up to the 100th floor before being able to challenge for the promotion duels again.The rules to climb the tower were very simple. However, when climbing the tower, it was possible to be paired up with an unlucky spirit qi professional who was actually very formidable but was stuck on the lower floors.Such people were also known as the Star Tower\u2019s goalkeepers.Everyone who climbed the Star Tower would be targeting the Celestial Stairway. Only people who were promoted to the Celestial Stairway were considered as the Star Tower\u2019s formidable individuals. Such people were known as the God Class.As this was the first time Lin Yuan was climbing the Star Tower, he had no choice but to register himself obediently.The identity information required to register for the Star Tower was different from others. The Star Web Card bound the Star Tower\u2019s identity information. It also meant that each Radiance Federation citizen would only be able to use their true identity to participate in the Star Tower\u2019s Star Tower.The Radiance Federation had plenty of unions, and most of them had huge amounts of resources and high salaries to attract the spirit qi professionals. All of the unions would form teams to participate in some large-scale tournaments.The higher-ranked duelists with potential would normally become recruitment targets for the unions.When entering the Star Tower\u2019s newcomer registration room, Lin Yuan noticed that it was extremely quiet.There was a young man flipping and browsing through a book that was related to feys. When he saw Lin Yuan entering, he immediately said, \u201cNew climber, hurry up and come over to fill up the form! After filling up the form, I will bring you inside to input the information.\u201dThe young man then swiftly placed the form on the table for Lin Yuan. He then looked at Genius and Chimey standing on Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulders and said with an intrigued tone, \u201cYour two feys look rather good! I didn\u2019t think that there would be spirit beasts that I cannot recognize.\u201dLin Yuan let out a smile in response. Genius had evolved from a Hundred Questions Beast, while Chimey had evolved from a Sound Bird.Genius was already a Bronze Thousand Questions Beast, while Chimey was a Bronze Streamcloud Azure Bird.No one had ever evolved the Hundred Questions Beast and the Sound Bird to bronze-grade. Therefore, they were unique in this world, and it was natural that no one could recognize them.Lin Yuan swiftly handed over the form with his personal information.The young man received it and took a glance. Seeing that there was no problem, he stood up and walked in front of Lin Yuan. \u201cFollow me then. It might be rather troublesome to input the information for the first time, but you will have proof of registration on the Star Web after the first input. The next time your occupation rank increases or you have new feys or newly evolved feys, you could enter the information by yourself in the Star Web system.\u201dThe young man informed Lin Yuan of the important matters. After completing his job role, he took out that same book he was reading earlier. He was carefully flipping through it while walking and seemed to be memorizing it.Lin Yuan saw the name of the book, and it was one of the books that was related to the primary rank Fey Observer. He then asked, \u201cBy the looks of your book, are you going to participate in the primary rank Fey Observer\u2019s exam?\u201dThe young man was surprised. He didn\u2019t expect the young Lin Yuan to actually be so clear about the examinable topics for primary rank Fey Observers.He looked at Lin with surprise and said, \u201cYes, I am going to pass the exam for the primary rank Fey Observer and prepare for the Creation Master exam next month.\u201dThe young man had an extremely prideful expression, and his tone was filled with confidence and the desire to flaunt.After the young man explained the necessary processes and completed Lin Yuan\u2019s registration, Lin Yuan left. To the young man, the thing he had to do right now was to memorize more knowledge on the Fey Observer occupation. Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t going to continue disrupting him.For anyone with the talent to take on the Creation Master exam and pass it, it would be the same as leaping through the dragon gate. Even a Class 1 Creation Master was a person that would receive respect and admiration, no matter where they went.Lin Yuan had already inputted the information for Morbius, Genius, and Chimey. As for Red Thorn, it was still a Normal fey and wasn\u2019t qualified to participate in the Star Tower\u2019s combat format. Thus, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t input Red Thorn\u2019s information.After registering in the Star Tower\u2019s list, an identity card that contained information on Lin Yuan was produced.Name: Lin YuanGender: MaleHeight: 178cmWeight: 61kgStar Tower Floor: 0th FloorSpirit Qi Occupation: Healing-Type ProfessionalOccupation Rank: D-RankContracted fey:Morbius (Elite 7/10, Epic)Thousand Questions Beast (Bronze 1/10, Normal)Streamcloud Azure Bird (Bronze 1/10, Normal)Duel Record:Duels: 0, Wins: 0, Losses: 0, Highest Floor: 0After seeing the identity card, Lin Yuan immediately chose to conceal all the information apart from the duel record and spirit qi occupation.The Star Web was the Radiance Federation\u2019s second world, and in terms of the assurance of privacy, it was even better than the real world.Now that Lin Yuan had inputted all the information, he immediately chose to enter the Star Tower.Lin Yuan had not participated in any duel in the Star Tower and was only a person among the innumerable bottom feeders. After choosing the option to match with an opponent, Lin Yuan was quickly matched with a duelist that was also on the Star Tower\u2019s bottom floor.When Lin Yuan saw the opponent\u2019s information, he was rather shocked. The opponent had already participated in 471 duels and the highest floor recorded was the 3rd floor.It meant that he had been pinned down in almost all of the 471 duels. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t still be at the Star Tower\u2019s bottom floor.The duel record couldn\u2019t be hidden, and before the duel, both parties would be able to see each other\u2019s records.The opponent was an old man that was roughly over 80 years of age and half his hair was already white. But after seeing Lin Yuan\u2019s duel record, he immediately laughed heartily. \u201cAn old man like me is actually able to encounter a newcomer! After I win this duel and climb to the 1st floor, I will not climb the tower anymore! This way, I will be able to stay on the 1st floor for one month, and I will be able to flaunt it to that Old Liu next door for one month.\u201dThe Star Tower was a testing ground where all spirit qi professionals in the Radiance Federation would participate. Certain rules and countermeasures were taken to prevent any spirit qi professionals from maintaining their floor record by not participating in any duels after climbing to a certain floor with luck.Any duelist that was climbing the tower would need to participate in one duel per month. It was also because of this rule that uber lucky individuals were unable to maintain their incorrect standard.Lin Yuan noticed that the old man on the other side had summoned a Normal Gray Beetle, which was charging at him. Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know what to do for a moment. He originally wanted to greet his opponent, but it seemed like there wasn\u2019t a need to greet, and the battle would end soon.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t ask Chimey to activate its ability. Instead, he asked Genius to charge forward. With a swing of the three tails, the Gray Beetle was knocked over.The old man evidently had only one contracted fey, so he immediately lost the duel.After losing the duel, the old man looked at Lin Yuan and put on a show. He lay down on the ground and bawled, \u201cAiyo, my poor old waist. The youngsters nowadays are truly merciless!\u201dLin Yuan looked at the dramatic old man and scratched the back of his head awkwardly.\u00a0This old uncle should participate in the Birth of An Actor[1]**.Sensing that the old man wasn\u2019t going to end his show anytime soon, Lin Yuan said, \u201cUncle, this is the Star Web. Even if you break your waist here, it will be fine.\u201dThe old man jumped up in response and rolled his eyes at Lin Yuan. \u201cI shall give you the win today. Back then, I was an expert that was able to execute the Angry Crow Takes Flight and Tornado Desecrates Trailer Park[2]! Forget it, forget it! This old man is going home to eat my medicine!\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s current Star Tower\u2019s record already displayed that he was on the 1st floor of the Star Tower.Lin Yuan felt that the duel at the bottom floor was surprisingly easy, but the old man\u2019s performance was amusing too. Lin Yuan\u2019s momentum increased as he continued to participate in more duels and quickly reached the 9th floor.Now that Lin Yuan reached the 9th floor, he finally and painstakingly encountered an opponent who used Elite feys.As soon as the duel started, the two opposing Elite Yellow-Spotted Hound and the Tusked Digging Boar were defeated by Chimey\u2019s Sound Thrust.Lin Yuan continued to climb the tower, and when he reached the 22nd floor, he met an opponent that actually used Bronze feys like him.However, the opposition\u2019s Bronze feys seemed rather powerful.[1] A variety show in China[2] These are all moves by Hak-Foo from Jackie Chan AdventuresPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: VictoryLin Yuan looked at his opponent and gasped a mouthful of cold air.While looking at the opponent\u2019s information, Lin Yuan realized he was facing a 27-year-old power offense-type spirit qi professional. His name was Huang Chenglin.His information card stated he had three Bronze feys\u2014Poison Fire Python, River Water Python, and Acid Mist Python. They weren\u2019t concealed at all.Although his honesty left Lin Yuan rather surprised, he didn\u2019t appreciate it. In a duel, not letting the opponent know of one\u2019s contracted feys was a trump card by itself.To expose one\u2019s own feys without any concealment\u2026 Instead of saying that he was particularly confident, it was better to say that he was simple-minded.Naturally, all feys had a bane that would counter them. When fighting against a fey that was your fey\u2019s weakness, it was rarely possible to turn the tables.However, Huang Chenglin was on the 22nd floor and was already considered an expert. As such, he had the capital to throw in a little advantage for the opponent.Huang Chenglin\u2019s highest floor record was 37th floor, which meant that Huang Chenglin had probably been unlucky and dropped to the 22nd floor. Even if he were to expose all of his feys\u2019 information and lost the advantage, it wasn\u2019t possible for him to drop to the 22nd floor.While Lin Yuan was reading Huang Chenglin\u2019s information, the same was happening on the other side.Before Lin Yuan could speak, the opponent spoke first.\u201cHey! Looking at your duel record, you are still a newcomer. But why did you only climb the Star Tower when your feys are at bronze-grade? You wouldn\u2019t be somebody that is unlicensed, right?! Hiding all of your information like this. Since you are a healing-type professional, I will let you prepare first before receiving your death.\u201dHuang Chenglin shrugged his shoulders in an extremely relaxed manner.A contractor\u2019s mental state would affect the fey\u2019s mental state. Huang Chenglin was totally relaxed and nonchalant, so the three Bronze python-species feys didn\u2019t adopt an offensive posture like before. Instead, they revolved around Huang Chenglin and waited for his command.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t respond. Among Huang Chenglin\u2019s three Bronze feys, Lin Yuan only knew a little about the Poison Fire Python. He didn\u2019t know anything about the River Water Python and the Acid Mist Python.As such, Lin Yuan commanded Genius to execute Tool Transformation. Genius turned into a pair of glasses, and when Lin Yuan wore them on his nose bridge, he took another glance at the Poison Fire Python, Acid Mist Python, and the River Water Python. All of a sudden, he had a comprehensive understanding of three pythons.It was different from how he understood knowledge that was provided by Morbius\u2019 True Data.True Data provided knowledge on the fey\u2019s grade, quality, abilities, and exclusive skill. The knowledge provided by Genius allowed Lin Yuan to understand the movement and attack behavior of this species. Such knowledge required accumulation of experience.At that moment, Lin Yuan suddenly realized that after he wore the glasses, it seemed like he could see the opponent feys\u2019 weak spots in their defenses.These weak spots were blind spots that could be deduced by observing the opponent\u2019s movement. If Lin Yuan were to attack those spots, the opponent wouldn\u2019t be able to put up an effective defense.It was the same as a person extending their hands to push forward and being unable to defend the attacks on their ribs.This discovery made Lin Yuan rather excited.When Huang Chenglin noticed that Lin Yuan had yet to reply to him and didn\u2019t move either, he said with a dissatisfied tone, \u201cHey! Unlicensed person! Stop with your pretense. Your cat that seemed to be the only one with attack power has actually turned into a pair of glasses with Tool Transformation. What use does your little bird have? Since you are a healing-type professional, your little bird wouldn\u2019t start producing bird\u2019s nests for others to eat and heal, right?\u201dChimey might not be able to speak after evolving to bronze-grade, but it could still understand Huang Chenglin\u2019s words. It was so angry that it started to hop around Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder. It was chirping loudly as though it was quarreling with Huang Chenglin.Lin Yuan finally spoke. \u201cI am ready, you may begin.\u201dAs soon as Lin Yuan spoke, he commanded Chimey to charge at the Poison Fire Python.When the Poison Fire Python saw Chimey charging over, it immediately responded by spraying a lump of poisonous flames.Lin Yuan immediately used Jasmine Lily\u2019s ability, Heal, and targeted it at Chimey.Using the air current, Chimey dashed into the flames. The powerful flow of air helped Chimey to effectively resist the poison fire attack.Before the flames could burn Chimey, it responded to Lin Yuan\u2019s command and released Turbulence.Turbulence would first be formed around Chimey\u2019s body, and because Chimey was in the middle of the poison flames, it scattered the Poison Fire Python\u2019s flames toward all directions when it executed the Turbulence ability.At that moment, the Acid Mist Python sprayed acid mist toward Chimey.When the acid mist contacted the poison fire blown away by Turbulence, they immediately exploded.The Poison Fire Python\u2019s poison fire wasn\u2019t considered powerful, but it was more than twice as powerful when blown by Turbulence. When the poison fire contacted the acid mist and exploded, the explosion extended and followed the acid mist.The blazing poison fire immediately surged into the mouth of the Acid Mist Python. It caused the Acid Mist Python to convulse on the ground immediately, rendering it unable to continue fighting.When feys reached bronze-grade, apart from their strength, strategy was also required.Huang Chenglin didn\u2019t expect to make such a huge mistake and actually allow his own fey to injure his own fey due to the chaotic battle.Seeing the convulsing Acid Mist Python on the ground, Huang Chenglin yelled at the Poison Fire Python with a tinge of blame, \u201cPoison Fire Python! Shot another Poison Fire at that silly bird!\u201dHowever, when Huang Chenglin gave the command, Chimey had already let out a loud chirp. Just as the Poison Fire Python opened its mouth to shoot Poison Fire, three invisible and formless Sound Thrusts pierced into the Poison Fire Python\u2019s mouth.A single Sound Thrust might not be able to strip off the Poison Fire Python\u2019s combat capability and might only severely injure its mouth. However, when three consecutive Sound Thrust pierced into its mouth, they immediately penetrated the weak oral cavity and opened up a hole in the head.An injury of this degree immediately sent the Poison Fire Python out of commission.Chimey had already used up half of its spirit qi.Lin Yuan quickly used the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s ability, Spirit Injection, on Chimey and helped it to recover a portion of the lost spirit qi. It was completed within the spark of flints.Huang Chenglin suddenly noticed that among the three of his python species feys, only the River Water Python could continue fighting.Originally, he thought that winning this duel was within his grasp, but he had immediately lost 2/3 of his major combat strength due to his incompetent commands.Huang Chenglin ground his teeth and yelled at Lin Yuan, \u201cIf you are capable, fight me with power! Winning with schemes is the behavior of a coward!\u201dLin Yuan looked at Huang Chenglin with a shocked expression and said, \u201cDo you actually want a healing-type professional like me to compare attack power with a power offense-type professional like you? A duel is settled with victories and defeats. This isn\u2019t playing house and seeing who has greater strength.\u201dWhen listening to Lin Yuan, Huang Chenglin suddenly let out a sly peal of laughter. \u201cYou have been duped!\u201dA water pillar suddenly burst out of the ground, targeting Chimey with rapid speed.When Huang Chenglin was speaking earlier, he had already arranged for the River Water Python to launch a sneak attack on Chimey. Seeing that his sneak attack was a success, he yelled at Lin Yuan, \u201cOf course this isn\u2019t playing house! You should understand that a duelist should not detest trickery\u2014\u201dBefore Huang Chenglin could finish his statement, Lin Yuan shouted, \u201cClear Sky!\u201dChimey received Lin Yuan\u2019s command, and the cloud patterns on its azure blue feathers suddenly lit up. They emitted a gentle light. The radiance was very gentle, but it became scorching hot when making contact with the water pillar.Clear Sky instantly evaporated the massive water pillar!Instead of saying that that massive water pillar had evaporated, Lin Yuan felt that it instantly vanished into the air when the water pillar contacted the radiance.Huang Chenglin was originally absorbed in frenzied laughter, but the sudden change caused his mouth to expand widely.It felt as though he couldn\u2019t understand what had happened.Just as Huang Chenglin was dazzled, Chimey released Turbulence to control the River Water Python. After another loud chirp, Sound Thrust pierced into the eyes of the River Water Python mercilessly.As a result, Lin Yuan successfully secured this duel\u2019s victory.Although Chimey was able to win, it was not because of its strength. The major factor that contributed to this duel was Lin Yuan using the glass-transformed Genius to help Chimey point out the three pythons\u2019 weak spots.This duel allowed Lin Yuan to receive plenty of rewards. This was also the first time Lin Yuan had participated in a disadvantageous duel.Lin Yuan ignored the defeated Huang Chenglin and logged out of the Star Web after rising up to the 23rd floor.Lin Yuan noticed he was lacking in this duel, especially when it came to attacking methods.If Lin Yuan was to encounter another opponent like Huang Chenglin and had no intel on the opponent\u2019s feys in advance, it would be hard for him to arrange a suitable strategy to win with Chimey alone.After all, not every opponent would be as arrogant as Huang Chenglin and display all of their feys.If Lin Yuan wanted to increase his attack methods, he would need to do his best to nurture Red Thorn.It seems like it isn\u2019t enough to just feed Red Thorn with low-grade alien insect carcasses. I have to think of methods to find high-grade flesh to help Red Thorn evolve quickly.For the next few days, Lin Yuan had spent 240 Radiance dollars in advance to purchase three drops of gold-grade dragon blood from Zhou Jiaxin. He was preparing to evolve his spirit-locked Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to bronze-grade.This way, Morbius\u2019 grade would also advance to bronze-grade, and it would obtain a new exclusive skill.Lin Yuan entered the Spirit Lock spatial zone and looked at the Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish in the spirit pool. It was growing bigger and more incredible-looking.He then took out a small jar, scooped up half a jar of water from the spirit pool, and placed the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish inside the jar.After enhancing the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to Elite X/Epic, just as it was about to reach the juncture of reaching bronze-grade, Lin Yuan immediately put in all three drops of dragon blood into the jar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Spirit-Gather GoldfishThe three drops of gold-grade dragon blood in Lin Yuan\u2019s hand felt as though they were flowing mercury. They didn\u2019t just have great density, but they also exuded a special luster that normal blood didn\u2019t possess.Normal blood would stain the enclosed bottles\u2019 walls, but the gold-grade dragon blood didn\u2019t stain the walls at all.When Lin Yuan was pouring them out, he could feel the dragon blood emitting pressure.The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was already at the evolution threshold, and when Lin Yuan used the spirit qi to assist in breaking through that barrier, the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s body transformed drastically.When the three drops of gold-grade dragon blood entered the water, they didn\u2019t fuse with the water immediately. Instead, they were absorbed by the evolving Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s traces of dragon beast bloodline.While the Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s body was constantly transforming, the three drops of dragon blood entered its body. The moment the dragon blood entered, the Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish reacted even more drastically.All of a sudden, the Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish looked as though it went berserk and started to smash against the water jar\u2019s walls. With each smash, there would be plenty of fresh blood seeping out of its scales and fusing into the water.Lin Yuan watched the Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s berserk behavior and could sense the agonizing pain it was suffering right now.After each smash, there would be some scales that would fall off of its body.Lin Yuan might be concerned for the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, but he knew that it was in the process of awakening the dragon-species bloodline in its body. It was absolutely necessary.The most precious part of a dragon-species fey was its blood. The concentration of the dragon-species blood would also determine the fey\u2019s value.At that moment, the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was activating the traces of dragon bloodline in its body with the three drops of gold-grade dragon blood. It was going through a process to change its entire body\u2019s blood.The Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish struggled in the water jar for three hours, and Lin Yuan watched intently for three hours too.The Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s fish scales were already like dilapidated decorations that hung on the body. They were in such bad condition that it had no defensive capabilities at all.The blood that flowed out of the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish didn\u2019t fuse with the water anymore and was creating a thin layer of protection on the wounds of the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish instead. Lin Yuan knew that the traces of dragon beast bloodline in the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish had been completely activated, and it had completed the blood-changing process.The dragon-species bloodline in the Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish might be very thin, but it was still a dragon-species fey now.Lin Yuan circulated the spiritual power in his body to gather the spirit qi in the air and channeled it into the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, which had awakened its bloodline.The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s evolution speed was much faster than before, and its body was gradually growing with a layer of black scale armor. It was completely different from its previous fish scales.The ink-black scale armor had a very pearl-like luster. Each piece of scale armor was covering a faint dark gold substance. The damaged fishtail had instantly grown longer, and it only stopped after it was as long as the body.The massive black tail was just like a layered skirt.The Telescope eyes that the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish had previously had almost withdrawn completely after this evolution. However, the upper eye areas had bumps that weren\u2019t as obvious.Lin Yuan took a deep breath.\u00a0This Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish has finally been evolved into a Bronze dragon-species fey. Now that it evolved into a dragon-species fey, it means that the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s evolution path will reach a higher level. The higher level brings about endless possibilities.When checking through True Data, the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish didn\u2019t have the same name. It was now called the Spirit-Gather Goldfish.Siphoning spirit qi was just a minor advantage, and gathering spirit qi was considered a good fortune.Lin Yuan could feel that the Spirit-Gather Goldfish was emitting concentrated spirit qi. After some calculations, the Bronze Spirit-Gather Goldfish would release spirit qi that was equivalent to the spirit qi contained in 1,000 catties of inferior energy ores.Of course, the Spirit-Gather Goldfish was able to release so much spirit qi mainly because it had awakened the dragon-species bloodline\u2019s traces in its body. Otherwise, even if it evolved to bronze-grade, it wouldn\u2019t be able to emit so much spirit qi.Since the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish reached bronze-grade with Epic quality, Lin Yuan could now pick its exclusive skill.[Spirit Qi Flare]: Increase the release of spirit qi with extreme speed.[Spirit Qi Absorption]: Increase the absorption speed of spirit qi and also have an increased speed when making progress in grade and quality.[Spirit Qi Imprint]: The spirit qi that is constantly released to the environment will be stored within the Spirit Qi Imprint instead. It will be branded on the contractor\u2019s body, and the contractor can release the spirit qi contained within the Spirit Qi Imprint.These three exclusive skills were all exceptional for the Spirit-Gather Goldfish.Spirit Qi Flare would allow the Spirit-Gather Goldfish to have an additional motive force and become a spirit qi fountain.Spirit Qi Absorption would allow the Spirit-Gather Goldfish to increase its evolution speed. It could actually negate the Spirit-Gather Goldfish\u2019s flaw\u2014evolution difficulty.If this Spirit-Gather Goldfish was in the outside world and had the Spirit Qi Absorption choice among the exclusive skills, eight out of ten individuals would probably pick Spirit Qi Absorption without hesitation.However, this was for the others who had extreme difficulty in evolving the Spirit-Gather Goldfish. It wasn\u2019t much of a problem for Lin Yuan apart from spending more time and energy.As such, Lin Yuan immediately chose the third exclusive skill, Spirit Qi Imprint. It was an exceptional exclusive skill, but for Lin Yuan, the biggest advantage was that it would be enhanced along with the Spirit-Gather Goldfish\u2019s grade.The Spirit-Gather Goldfish\u2019s exclusive skill, Spirit Qi Imprint, and the Jasmine Lily\u2019s exclusive skill, Recovery Imprint, were both similar in tune. The Jasmine Lily\u2019s Recovery Imprint accumulated healing energy, while the Spirit-Gather Goldfish\u2019s Spirit Qi Imprint accumulated the spirit qi that would be released by the Spirit-Gather Goldfish.If the Spirit Qi Imprint was used appropriately, it meant that Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t need to worry about the volume of his spirit qi for a certain period of time and would be able to release the fey\u2019s abilities freely.In Lin Yuan\u2019s opinion, it could actually be treated as a method to save his life.Since the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish evolved to bronze-grade, Morbius also successfully evolved to bronze-grade.When evolving to bronze-grade, Morbius had also awakened from its slumber. Morbius\u2019 bronze-grade exclusive skill, Pure Land of Bliss, also appeared.[Pure Land of Bliss]: The Spirit Lock spatial zone will produce soil that is great for recovering near-death fey\u2019s injuries. The fey\u2019s recovery time will be determined by the grade of Morbius and the dying fey.A clear and calm voice echoed in Lin Yuan\u2019s ears.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54: Pure Land of Bliss\u201cYuan, after this evolution, I will hibernate for a period of time to completely recover from the damage inflicted on my spiritual energy during the contract\u2019s formation.\u201dTheir spiritual energy would decide the number of contracted feys that a spirit qi professional could have. Each additional contracted fey would be the same as splitting out another portion of spiritual energy.This was also why everyone had different numbers of contracted feys.Lin Yuan had contracted Morbius at the age of eight when his spiritual energy was frail. In order to protect Lin Yuan, Morbius had forcefully suppressed its spiritual energy, causing damage to Morbius\u2019 source.\u201cHow long would you need to recover? Do you need me to purchase some spiritual ingredients for recovery?\u201d Lin Yuan asked in a calm and concerned tone. It felt as though they were old friends that knew each other for a long time, or like a partner or family.\u201cThere isn\u2019t a need for spiritual ingredients. I don\u2019t know how long I will be hibernating for this time. Yuan, I didn\u2019t think that you would be able to evolve me to bronze-grade within such a short period. Come, before I hibernate. Let me bring you to see the transformations to the Spirit Lock spatial zone and also to explain about the Pure Land of Bliss.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan entered the Spirit Lock spatial zone, he realized that it was twice as big as before. This spatial zone was about the size of his small store in the Star Web now.The spirit pool size didn\u2019t just become twice as big, and even the concentration of spirit qi in the spatial zone also significantly increased\u2014from five times to eight times.However, all the inferior energy ores that were placed at the bottom of the Spirit Pool had all disintegrated. It seemed like eight times the spirit qi concentration wasn\u2019t the upper limit of this bronze-grade Spirit Lock spatial zone.A clear voice echoed. \u201cThe spirit qi concentration\u2019s upper limit is ten times as much as the outside world.\u201dBefore this, Lin Yuan would need to figure out everything about the Spirit Lock spatial zone by himself. Now that Morbius\u2019 consciousness was sober, Lin Yuan simply needed to think, and Morbius would resolve his doubts.The spirit qi concentration had increased from five times to ten times. It was the same as shortening the time by half when evolving Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to elite-grade. The increase in the size of the spirit pool would also allow more Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to be nurtured.This would, in turn, allow Lin Yuan to earn Radiance dollars with increased speed. He would be able to produce one batch within three days.Given the spirit pool\u2019s size, he would be able to nurture about 100 Spirit-Siphon Goldfish each time. He would at least be able to earn 800 Radiance dollars within three days after selling all the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. Lin Yuan had yet to include the money he could earn for selling Bronze Usneas.Presently, earning Radiance dollars was already effortless for Lin Yuan. In fact, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have to accept any more custom-ordered Elite feys after completing the transaction with Stream in the Cloud.If the amount of time required to prepare custom Elite feys was used to produce Bronze Usneas, he would be able to earn much more Radiance dollars.Lin Yuan might be earning more money now, but he was also spending much more. The more money he earned, the more he felt that he wasn\u2019t earning enough.The evolution of feys was like a boat sailing against the flow of water and would need to overcome plenty of waves.A single rare spiritual ingredient would already cost an unknown amount of money. Therefore, it was impossible to have enough Radiance dollars that would be enough for his expenditure.In order to enhance the Jasmine Lily\u2019s quality to Legend at bronze-grade, two Mahogany Tree Cores were required, and they already caused Lin Yuan big headaches.Lin Yuan had arranged a simple setup in the Spirit Lock spatial zone as he put in some simple furniture, like a massive workbench and a chair.At that moment, the Bronze Jasmine Lily was placed on the workbench. After evolving to bronze-grade, the Jasmine Lily was significantly different in appearance. But as compared to the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, which had undergone a complete metamorphosis, it wasn\u2019t much.The Bronze Jasmine Lily had turned from stalks into bunches. The half woody stems had also vanished. Layers and stacks of Jasmine Lily flowers were all gathered, and it looked just like jadeite. Just by looking at it, one would feel as though they were being healed.\u201cYuan, look over there. That is the exclusive skill, Pure Land of Bliss.\u201dLin Yuan looked over and saw a new piece of land in the Spirit Lock spatial zone that was around 20 square meters.Scarlet red fences encircled the space, and inside was sparkling jade-white soil.Lin Yuan walked over and grabbed the soil. He couldn\u2019t feel any rough or craggy texture from the soil as it was extremely soft.\u201cThe Pure Land of Bliss can heal Bronze feys rapidly and can gradually heal Silver feys. As for Gold feys that are in a dying state, placing them in the Pure Land of Bliss can maintain their dying state. As long as nutrients are constantly provided, they won\u2019t die.\u201dMorbius introduced the ability of the exclusive skill, Pure Land of Bliss, to Lin Yuan. He didn\u2019t expect Morbius\u2019 exclusive skill to actually be so incredible.Only Class 3 Creation Masters would have the confidence to make an attempt to save Gold feys in dying states.In fact, it was possible that Class 3 Creation Masters wouldn\u2019t be able to save a dying Gold fey. There wasn\u2019t a need to talk about severely injured Gold feys, but dying and severely injured were two different things.A dying fey would have already exhausted its source and vitality. They could only remain standing because of their powerful gold-grade physique. Such a kind of dying fey would be sold as fresh spiritual ingredients.Before obtaining the Pure Land of Bliss, Lin Yuan only dared and hoped to pick up left out Silver feys. Now, with the Pure Land of Bliss, he could guarantee that the dying Gold fey wouldn\u2019t die.Given the Spirit Lock spatial zone\u2019s spirit qi concentration, which was ten times more than the outside world, Lin Yuan could use his ability to gradually recover the dying Gold fey\u2019s injuries.Every time a Gold fey appeared, it would be put up for auction in the Star Web\u2019s Rare Lifeform Pavilion. There weren\u2019t any stores in the Star Web that would directly sell Gold feys.Lin Yuan had the capability to be involved with Gold feys right now.\u201cMorbius, this Pure Land of Bliss is truly practical.\u201dAfter hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s amazed tone, Morbius chuckled and said, \u201cIt isn\u2019t the only function. You can use the spiritual power in your body to summon a piece of Pure Land of Bliss in the outside world and use it to heal feys that suffered damage to the source. The range of the Pure Land of Bliss will be directly related to the amount of spiritual power you use.\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s eyes widened after hearing the explanation.\u00a0This Pure Land of Bliss can actually be used in the outside world as an ability?! This means that I won\u2019t need to expose my spirit-qi-channeling ability! I can just use the Pure Land of Bliss to heal the feys\u2019 damaged source.Lin Yuan had the talent of a healing-type spirit qi professional, and he always had the objective of becoming one too.Therefore, when nurturing the Jasmine Lily, Lin Yuan had never been complacent. In fact, he had also chosen the Jasmine Lily to be the first fey to be enhanced into a Fantasy Breed.Lin Yuan suddenly felt that the Recovery Imprint, Spirit Qi Imprint, and the Pure Land of Bliss were forming a perfect combination.After days and months of spirit qi accumulation in the Spirit Qi Imprint, will I be able to see a Pure Land of Bliss that reaches the horizon when I open up the Spirit Qi Imprint? After opening up the Recovery Imprint, will I be able to heal the entire battlefield during a dimensional rift invasion?Of course, Lin Yuan knew that he was still very weak. If he wanted to become stronger, he would need to take one step and continue pressing forward.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55: Five Fortune RanchuAfter exiting the Spirit Lock spatial zone, Morbius started hibernating and recovering its injured source.At this moment, Morbius\u2019 attributes were displayed to Lin Yuan with True Data.[Fey Name]: Morbius[Fey Species]: ???[Fey Grade]: Bronze (1/10)[Fey Type]: Spatial/Mystery[Fey Quality]: NormalAbilities:[True Data]: All complicated information that is invisible to the eye is turned into data. Information that is turned into data might contain truth that cannot be distinguished on the surface.[Calm Mind]: Passive ability. Effects of Calm Mind can be improved according to the fey\u2019s grade. Calm Mind can stabilize the mind and has a certain probability of resisting negative conditions.Exclusive Skill:[Spirit Lock]: Morbius\u2019 spatial zone can be used to nurture feys. The initial grade of the fey that Morbius\u2019 spatial zone can nurture must not be higher than Morbius\u2019 grade. Morbius isn\u2019t able to increase its grade by itself, so its grade will be increased along with the fey\u2019s grade that it nurtures. At the same time, Morbius can obtain the initial ability of the fey that it nurtures. However, Morbius will not obtain abilities when its grade increases. Whenever Morbius increases a grade, it will be able to nurture one more fey. Morbius\u2019 method of growth will remain unchanged.[Pure Land of Bliss]: The Spirit Lock spatial zone will produce soil that is great for recovering the injuries of near-death fey. The fey\u2019s recovery time will be determined by the grade of Morbius and the dying fey.[Normal Spirit Lock]:Jasmine Lily: Bronze (1/10), NormalAbility \u2013 [Heal]: Rapidly recovers external injuries and gradually recovers vitality.Exclusive Skill \u2013 [Recovery Imprint]: Accumulate the healing energy that is released by the Jasmine Lily during normal times. The contractor can activate the imprint to release the accumulated healing energy.[Elite Spirit Lock]:Spirit-Gather Goldfish: Bronze (1/10), NormalAbility: [Spirit Injection]: Restore a certain amount of spiritual power at once and gradually restore the lost spiritual power.Exclusive Skill \u2013 [Spirit Qi Imprint]: The spirit qi that is constantly released to the environment will be stored within the Spirit Qi Imprint instead. It will be branded on the contractor\u2019s body, and the contractor can release spirit qi contained within the Spirit Qi Imprint.While looking at Morbius\u2019 attributes, Lin Yuan scratched his head.\u00a0If I wish to evolve Morbius to silver-grade, I will need to spirit-lock a third fey.After selling another batch of Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, Lin Yuan realized that Red Thorn had already progressed to Normal IX/Flawless as it had constantly been digesting alien insect carcasses.The alien insect carcasses cost more than 100 Radiance dollars, but Red Thorn had yet to break through to elite-grade.At that moment, Lin Yuan noticed that if he couldn\u2019t channel spirit qi to the fey, it would actually be that difficult to evolve them.Red Thorn\u2019s evolution was Lin Yuan\u2019s number one priority now. The Source Seed would evolve according to Lin Yuan\u2019s will, and the evolution method he had chosen for Red Thorn was food consumption. Therefore, in order to receive any enhancement during evolution, it would need to come from the source of food.The flesh of a high-grade fey or a high-grade dimensional lifeform would be especially beneficial for Red Thorn\u2019s evolution. However, be it high-grade fey or dimensional lifeform flesh, most of them were considered precious spiritual or food ingredients.Lin Yuan\u2019s wish to purchase large quantities of high-grade fey flesh wasn\u2019t practical. But since it was the crucial juncture for Red Thorn\u2019s evolution, Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t afford to be stingy.He logged into the Star Web and immediately contacted Zhou Jiaxin.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cBig Sister Xin, I wish to order another batch of Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. This time, I want ten Telescope Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.\u201dLin Yuan was planning to nurture the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish and reserve ten of them. These ten would be seeded candidates that would be nurtured to bronze-grade before being sold.Bronze Spirit-Siphon Goldfish would be able to enter the doors of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion. If Lin Yuan wished to purchase the Mahogany Tree Cores, he would need to rely on the Bronze Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.Of course, Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t exchange such precious feys like Bronze Spirit-Siphon Goldfish for Radiance dollars. He would put them up in the Rare Lifeform Pavilion and trade them for Mahogany Tree Cores.Trading for items might be primitive, but it was the most effective method to obtain spiritual ingredients and feys.Zhou Jiaxin: \u201cAlright, I will pick the best Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish for you. That\u2019s right, I have a female Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish that is already pregnant. I wonder if you are interested?\u201dFemale Spirit-Siphon Goldfish weren\u2019t that rare, but it was extremely difficult for Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to get pregnant. The higher the rarity of a fey, the harder it was for it to reproduce.It was a lock that was put down by nature, and humans couldn\u2019t unlock it.When Lin Yuan read that Zhou Jiaxin had a pregnant Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, his eyes lit up. A female Spirit-Siphon Goldfish could give birth to around 1,000 Spirit-Siphon Goldfish each time.A Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s eggs had a hard time surviving, and it was mainly because there wasn\u2019t enough spirit qi for the eggs to absorb. However, it would no longer be a problem in the Spirit Lock spatial zone\u2019s spirit pool.The spirit pool might only be able to contain 100 Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish at once, but the eggs would need to be nurtured, and Lin Yuan could split them up into different tanks for breeding.This way, he would be able to save a huge portion of money and would no longer need to purchase Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cBig Sister Xin, I want the female Spirit-Siphon Goldfish! I wonder what is the price?\u201dZhou Jiaxin: \u201cThe female Spirit-Siphon Goldfish might be a little expensive. It costs 80 Radiance dollars.\u201dLin Yuan frowned at the reply.If this was the price, Lin Yuan would rather purchase Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish each time and nurture them.A single Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish would only be 8 Radiance dollars, and it was due to the good species. An ordinary species would only be worth 5 Radiance dollars.The Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was pregnant and could be sold for 80 Radiance dollars. The price was truly a little high.Lin Yuan felt that 15 Radiance dollars should be the limit.Zhou Jiaxin: \u201cThat\u2019s right, I forgot to mention that the pregnant female Spirit-Siphon Goldfish is a Five Fortune Ranchu. That\u2019s why it is expensive. The prices Big Sister Xin offers will never make you suffer losses.\u201dFive Fortune Ranchu!? No wonder it\u2019s so expensive!Even a century after the Spirit Qi Awakening, humans still had the instinctive preference for auspicious things. The Five Fortune Ranchu was a rare and auspicious species among the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.Its round body had five colors, which signified five fortunes. It might have the same function as a regular Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, but it cost ten times more than a regular one.Elite Five Fortune Ranchus were basically not available in the market. One could only purchase one from Creation Masters that had nurtured it personally.Lin Yuan had been purchasing spiritual ingredients from Zhou Jiaxin mainly because she was honest when doing business. Lin Yuan realized that he had underestimated Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s connections.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s ThoughtsDeep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cBig Sister Xin, I shall purchase that female Five Fortune Ranchu. Does Big Sister Xin sell high-grade spirit beast flesh?\u201dAfter Lin Yuan\u2019s multiple Spirit-Siphon Goldfish purchases, Zhou Jiaxin had made a brief investigation on Lin Yuan. As a result, she had found out that Lin Yuan\u2019s account, Deep Mountain Elder Lin, was also an owner of a fey store.Zhou Jiaxin had observed it for some time. After Lin Yuan\u2019s store obtained the Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, they would all become elite-grade in a short period of time.These were Spirit-Siphon Goldfish!Zhou Jiaxin made a bold guess and was quickly frightened by her own conjecture.In order to evolve 100 Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish to elite-grade within three to five days, one must at least be a Class 3 Creation Master. Of course, Class 2 Creation Masters couldn\u2019t be excluded either.However, if this was the work of a Class 2 Creation Master, to evolve Spirit-Siphon Goldfish at such a large scale, there must be at least 20 Class 2 Creation Masters.Nonetheless, Zhou Jiaxin couldn\u2019t understand why a Creation Master would want to evolve Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. Wouldn\u2019t it be better to evolve a few Silver feys instead of spending so much effort to evolve Spirit-Siphon Goldfish?It didn\u2019t matter what Zhou Jiaxin was guessing as she was certain about something. There must be a Creation Master backing Lin Yuan\u2019s store, and it was highly possible that it was a Class 3 Creation Master.Class 3 Creation Masters were individuals that even Class 5 stores might not have, and they would most certainly be considered VIP guests.Zhou Jiaxin had operated her store for many years, and she sold the best quality of spiritual ingredients every time. After so many years of hard work, she had finally reached the standard of a Class 3 Star Web store. This was mainly because she had been suppressing her prices and selling in huge quantities.Zhou Jiaxin wasn\u2019t able to upgrade her store to Class 4 because she didn\u2019t have a Creation Master\u2019s backing.Previously, Zhou Jiaxin was only thinking of developing Lin Yuan into her loyal customer, but now, she thought whether she could create a better relationship with Lin Yuan.She could purchase rare items from Lin Yuan\u2019s store that wouldn\u2019t be available in the market at high prices. That way, she would be able to build the reputation of her store and upgrade it to Class 4. With a larger store space, she would be able to manage it even better.To manage the Star Web store well had always been Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s persistence. However, she couldn\u2019t find any Creation Master as her backer, and it had been a difficult journey.Zhou Jiaxin did think of recruiting a Creation Master, however, most of the ones she found were Class 1 ones. Even the conditions Class 1 Creation Masters set were already so high that Zhou Jiaxin couldn\u2019t afford them.Most of the Creation Masters in Class 5 stores were young talents chosen by the store, and they used resources to nurture the Creation Masters.Zhou Jiaxin had nurtured young and talented people too, and she wasn\u2019t stingy with the resources. However, they all ended up as failures. Evidently, it wasn\u2019t that easy to produce Creation Masters.Zhou Jiaxin wanted to import some rare feys from Lin Yuan\u2019s store, but it wasn\u2019t that easy to open this kind of conversation topic.Even if one wanted to become a bootlicker, they couldn\u2019t simply lick without any reason. It was important to use a method of licking that the boss could accept and to lick without leaving any traces.After being the owner of a spiritual ingredient store for many years, even the most reserved person would be able to turn the method to recruit Creation Masters into an art.However, the high-grade spirit beast flesh that Lin Yuan wanted was something that Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t have in her store right now. Zhou Jiaxin knew that if she said she didn\u2019t have any and if Lin Yuan required them, he would definitely find others for it.Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t wish for the situation to turn like that. If Lin Yuan sought out other store owners and became their regular customer, wouldn\u2019t she suffer losses?Therefore, Zhou Jiaxin made a decision and replied: \u201cI do not have any high-grade spirit beast or dimensional lifeform\u2019s flesh. In order to sell high-grade dimensional lifeform\u2019s flesh, a special certificate is required. There are only a few stores that have the certificates. if you wish to buy them, I can recommend you to them.\u201dLin Yuan didn\u2019t expect Zhou Jiaxin to be willing to share her contacts with him. Contacts were the livelihood for spiritual ingredients and fey stores. Each store had its own unique contacts, and this was a capital that allowed them to continue surviving.It didn\u2019t matter for what reason Zhou Jiaxin was willing to share her contacts, Lin Yuan was going to remember this favor.After seeking for survival in the darkness for many years, Lin Yuan already knew how to be grateful.Deep Mountain Elder Lin: \u201cThen I shall thank Big Sister Xin. I am now really in urgent need of some high-grade spirit beast flesh or high-grade dimensional lifeform flesh.Zhou Jiaxin was delighted to see Lin Yuan\u2019s response. She was afraid that Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t appreciate her help at first. Now that Lin Yuan gave his thanks, it meant that he accepted her favor.When the conversation was over, Lin Yuan followed Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s instructions and arrived at the recommended Star Web store that didn\u2019t have any banner.Lin Yuan saw a tall and stalwart man, who was flipping through a book, seated there. He was constantly recording something in the book, as though he was tallying the inventory of the goods.Sensing that someone was inside, the tall and stalwart man looked up and said, \u201cThis isn\u2019t a store, I don\u2019t attend to visitors!\u201dLin Yuan quickly responded, \u201cZhou Jiaxin recommended me to purchase high-grade spirit beast and dimensional lifeform flesh here.\u201dUpon hearing that it was Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s referral, the tall and stalwart man glanced at Lin Yuan. He contacted Zhou Jiaxin to verify Lin Yuan\u2019s identity before speaking. \u201cSince Jiaxin recommended you, you can call me Big Brother Feng.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan saw how cautious the tall and stalwart man was, he already speculated something. This store probably didn\u2019t have the special certificate and was probably an illegal store.Although the Star Web was a place with great ability for checks and inspections, there were plenty of illegal stores in the Star Web. Each time a store was caught, there would be a corresponding punishment. It was natural for the tall and stalwart man to be sensitive and anxious.\u201cBig Brother Feng, do you sell high-grade spirit beast flesh here?\u201dThe tall and stalwart man shook his head and said, \u201cI am only able to obtain one batch of high-grade fey flesh every month. Furthermore, those scrap parts couldn\u2019t be treated as spiritual ingredients or used for delicacies. There isn\u2019t a choice of species. One catty of bronze-grade flesh would cost 20,000 Federation dollars, one catty of silver-grade flesh would cost 50,000 Federation dollars, and one catty of gold-grade flesh would cost 1 Radiance dollar. Presently, I have sold out all the goods, and half a year of goods have already been reserved.\u201dLin Yuan frowned at the response, but Big Brother Feng added, \u201cIt is hard to buy high-grade fey flesh everywhere. After all, high-ranked spirit qi professionals would use fey flesh to feed their carnivorous feys. But if you need dimensional lifeform\u2019s flesh, I have quite the stock, and I can sell them to you for a lower price.\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s frown had relaxed at this point.Since he was feeding them to Red Thorn, either high-grade fey flesh or dimensional lifeform flesh would do. However, high-grade fey flesh would contain more spirit qi than dimensional lifeform flesh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: Lord RangerLin Yuan had already decided to purchase the flesh of high-grade dimensional lifeforms.\u201cBig Brother Feng, then I shall get some high-grade dimensional lifeform flesh. I wonder how much are you selling the dimensional lifeform flesh for?\u201d\u201cTo be honest with you, the high-grade dimensional lifeform flesh that I received isn\u2019t edible like the high-grade spirit beast flesh. I am unable to receive any edible high-grade dimensional lifeform flesh, either. Most of the dimensional lifeform flesh I received are from the Abyss Dimensional Rift and Insect World Dimensional Rift.\u201dWhen Big Brother Feng explained, Lin Yuan could obviously feel the helplessness in the other party\u2019s eyes. Apparently, the sale of such dimensional lifeform flesh that caused harm to the human body wasn\u2019t doing well.However, there wasn\u2019t a need to consider such things for Red Thorn. In fact, the kind of dimensional lifeform flesh other feys couldn\u2019t consume might actually be beneficial for Red Thorn\u2019s evolution.\u201cI wonder what is the price for the dimensional lifeform flesh?\u201dBig Brother Feng didn\u2019t think that Lin Yuan would express an intention to purchase and wash rather delighted.\u201cClass 1 dimensional lifeforms are equivalent to Bronze feys and cost 500 Federation dollars for each catty. Class 2 dimensional lifeforms are equivalent with Silver feys and cost 8,000 Federation dollars for each catty. Class 3 dimensional lifeforms are equivalent to Gold feys and cost 100,000 Federation dollars for each catty.\u201dLin Yuan was rather surprised and didn\u2019t think that dimensional lifeform flesh was actually so cheap. It was several times cheaper than fey flesh.Gold dimensional lifeform flesh only cost 100,000 Federation dollars for each catty. It also meant that 100 Radiance dollars could purchase 1,000 catties.Of course, Red Thorn was only at normal-grade now, and even if it could digest dimensional lifeform flesh, it would also need a gradual adaptation.Previously, Lin Yuan had been feeding it with gradeless alien insect carcasses. The amount of energy contained within those carcasses might be comparable with Normal feys.Therefore, Lin Yuan was planning to start feeding Red Thorn with bronze-grade fey flesh.\u201cBig Brother Feng, I will order 3,000 catties of Class 1 dimensional lifeform flesh this time. Let\u2019s provide our contact details. In the future, if I require more dimensional lifeform flesh, I will order directly from you.\u201dBig Brother Feng immediately smiled when he heard that Lin Yuan was going to purchase dimensional lifeform flesh. He said, \u201cOkay! I will give you a little more this time. A Class 1 alien insect is around 60 catties. I will give you 55 alien insects, and the surplus will be considered a gift.\u201dLin Yuan originally felt that high-grade dimensional lifeform flesh was cheap, but after using 1.5 Radiance dollars to purchase 3,000 catties only to receive 55 corpses, he felt that it wasn\u2019t that many.He had already fed Red Thorn 1,000 alien insects. Of course, the energy from 1,000 gradeless alien insects might only be equivalent to three of these Class 1 alien insects.After making the purchase, Lin Yuan was planning to enter seclusion.Apart from some duels in the Star Tower or evolving the Bronze Usneas, the rest of the time would be spent on watching Red Thorn\u2019s evolution.Once Red Thorn evolved to elite-grade, Lin Yuan could attempt to mix the fleshes of Class 1 and Class 2 dimensional lifeforms. He believed that Red Thorn would evolve to bronze-grade soon enough.\u2026When Lin Yuan was feeding Red Thorn, he could feel that Red Thorn was in a pleasant mood.As Red Thorn was rapidly consuming the Class 1 dimensional lifeform flesh, a problem occurred. A Class 1 alien insect\u2019s blood had a corrosiveness that could instantly turn a piece of wooden block into black charcoal.The corrosiveness had a certain impact on the Normal Red Thorn at first. Even the Red Thorn\u2019s Mouth of Relinquish had withered and turned dark because of the Class 1 alien insect\u2019s blood.Lin Yuan silently thought,\u00a0Not good, it seems like I am too anxious.Just as he was preparing to ask Red Thorn to spit out the Class 1 alien insect\u2019s flesh, Red Thorn\u2019s Mouth of Relinquish was already gradually recovering as it had absorbed the energy from its flesh.During the process of recovery, the Mouth of Relinquish would be corroded again. It would still wither and turn dark, but it wouldn\u2019t be as severe as before.Looking at the situation, Lin Yuan gave up on his plan to change Red Thorn\u2019s evolution through food consumption. After all, Red Thorn was obviously adapting to the Class 1 alien insect\u2019s corrosiveness and simultaneously was increasing its resistance toward corrosive blood.This was the evolution direction that the Class 1 alien insect had directly influenced. It was an evolutionary trait that was introduced afterward. Even if the Red Thorn was a Source Seed, there were some characteristics that couldn\u2019t be produced just because the contractor wanted it.Red Thorn had a harder time fully digesting the Class 1 alien insect. However, Lin Yuan could obviously feel that Red Thorn had a better resistance against the Class 1 alien insect\u2019s corrosive blood.At that moment, Lin Yuan suddenly felt that Red Thorn was asking for Lin Yuan\u2019s intention.Lin Yuan immediately said, \u201cEnhance your attack power. Enhance the vines that grew out previously!\u201dLin Yuan was most expectant of Red Thorn\u2019s attack power.When Red Thorn evolved to normal-grade, it had already grown out some vines that were two meters in length, and there were over a dozen of them.These vines allowed Red Thorn to have a certain level of combat capability. But in Lin Yuan\u2019s opinion, the vines were still rather weak.The vines might have extremely sharp reversed spikes, but it was still very hard to defeat and kill defense-type feys with these reversed spikes.After receiving Lin Yuan\u2019s command, Red Thorn fell into hibernation. Hibernation was an evolutionary process that was required for Red Thorn.The other feys would evolve according to their genus and would have a specific direction of evolution. Even though exclusive skills would increase the variation of the fey, there was still a rough model.Red Thorn didn\u2019t have such a model in its evolution, so it required instructions from Lin Yuan to grow, and the process required a long period of time.After one day, Lin Yuan realized that Red Thorn was still not moving. However, he could feel Red Thorn\u2019s current state due to the contract, and it was in a great condition.Genius jumped onto Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cYuan, I have already memorized everything in the books. I guarantee that I memorized all the details!\u201dAfter speaking, Genius used its little head to rub on Lin Yuan\u2019s cheek and enjoyed the intimate time with Lin Yuan.During these two days, Chimey had been obsessed with live streaming and didn\u2019t really pester Lin Yuan. Whenever Chimey met something it couldn\u2019t resolve, it would call for Genius. Genius was just like Chimey\u2019s super room manager and would make sure everything was in order.Chimey was only fooling around because it enjoyed singing and had started a live stream accidentally.However, the name of Sparrow Voice Loli Goddess was abnormally prominent. Its reputation was already able to crush all the other singing hosts.Of course, there was another reason why Sparrow Voice Loli Goddess was famous. It was due to the Radiance Hundred\u2019s Sequence #81, Lord Ranger.Lord Ranger had made huge donations during Sparrow Voice Loli Goddess\u2019 live stream and immediately became a top contributing fan.Each sequence member\u2019s words and actions in the Radiance Hundred would be closely followed by everyone else. The news that Lord Ranger had donated to Sparrow Voice Loli Goddess had immediately turned into the most hyped-up piece of news in the Star Web.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Creation Master AssociationThis matter might have attracted the attention of the entire Star Web, but be it Chimey itself or Lin Yuan, none of them noticed it.When Chimey was singing, it would still be looking at the messages and the praises that would constantly flow. It wouldn\u2019t bother about the other comments.Lin Yuan had constantly been making himself stronger and didn\u2019t even know that Chimey had started live streaming on the Star Web.Genius had completed its study on primary Scholar, Spiritual Ingredient Analyst, and Fey Observer occupations. Lin Yuan saw that there were still three days left before the appointment date with Zhou Jiaxin, so he decided to go for the Creation Master exam.The Creation Master exam wasn\u2019t conducted on the Star Web. It was conducted in the city, and only the main cities would have Creation Master Associations.The Creation Master Association for the Redbud City was established within the main city area.Lin Yuan brought Genius along and rode on a Bronze Black-Winged Windfalcon toward Redbud City.After taking a ride on a Platinum avian fey, Lin Yuan no longer had the same sensation he had when riding this Bronze avian fey for the first time in the past.When he arrived at Redbud City, it was already afternoon. Lin Yuan suddenly thought to call Chu Ci out for lunch, but he immediately recalled he was here to participate in the Creation Master exam. He decided to participate in the Creation Master exam and share his success with Chu Ci later.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t worried there might be any hiccups during the Creation Master exam. In fact, he was even wondering if he could complete the Class 1 Creation Master exam within two hours and obtain the chance to be exempted from the promotion exams of three lifestyle-class spirit qi occupations. He would then be able to participate in the Class 2 Creation Master exam.Lin Yuan immediately flagged for a car and headed to the Creation Master Association.All sorts of facilities and infrastructures in Redbud City were superior to the Xia Region.The Redbud City\u2019s streets were 30 meters in width, and even Platinum feys were able to traverse on the streets with ease. However, almost no one would summon their Platinum feys in the city area of Redbud City. Even the formidable spirit qi professionals would use transportation machines. It allowed Redbud City to have a peaceful and prosperous atmosphere.At the Creation Master Association entrance, Lin Yuan looked at the large doors of the Creation Master Association and took another glance at the city lord residence that wasn\u2019t far away.Lin Yuan felt that the Creation Master Association was probably even grander than the city lord residence.One could easily see the amount of respect that the Creation Master Association had.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t pick a time to participate in the Creation Master exam, and it was a pure coincidence.However, there were plenty of apprehensive people at the Creation Master Association entrance as they headed inside. Most of the people were here to participate in the exam. Some of the people entered with apprehensive expressions, while others entered with a face filled with confidence. When these people exited, almost every one of them would be from the dejected batch.On average, only one out of a hundred individuals would exit with extremely excited and delighted expressions. It showed how difficult the Creation Master exam was.The majority of the people who participated in the Creation Master exam would be properly prepared. Otherwise, they wouldn\u2019t be able to make another attempt within the year if they failed. Not many people would be willing to take one entire year as a bet if they didn\u2019t have any confidence.Despite the fact that they were amply prepared, it was still very difficult to pass the exam.Lin Yuan had already asked Genius to transform into the glasses with Tool Transformation. After wearing the glasses, Lin Yuan had an additional scholarly aura that made him a little more amiable.When Lin Yuan entered the Creation Master Association, he was immediately stopped by the attendants inside.Each attendant in the Creation Master Association would be attending to 30 individuals who were here to participate in the Creation Master exam.Lin Yuan observed quietly and noticed there was only one individual in his group that was rather confident. The rest of the people were obviously very nervous. There was even a plump person whose legs would shiver when he walked.When there were 30 individuals, the attendant said, \u201cLater on, show me the proof that you have obtained the primary rank of three lifestyle-class occupations before you participate in the exam. When you exit, bring your scorecard to me, and you can leave with your proof.\u201dThe attendant was an extremely gentle elder sister, and her voice was so gentle that it felt as though water was dripping out.After giving the instructions, she sat on the chair and gave a \u2018good luck\u2019 gesture to the people participating in the exam and said, \u201cI wish that all of you can pass the exam and have a great future ahead.\u201dThe encouragement before the exam was truly invigorating. As an attendant in the Creation Master Association, she was a Creation Master herself. For a Creation Master to be working in the Creation Master Association meant that she was extremely talented.For a person with such a transcending status, there wasn\u2019t a need to say anything. Since she was saying something, then it must be from the bottom of her heart.At this moment, Lin Yuan scratched his head embarrassedly. When everyone else had headed for the exam, Lin Yuan stood still and said, \u201cErm, I heard that I could participate in three primary ranked lifestyle-class occupation exams in the Creation Master Association. Therefore, I didn\u2019t have any proof prepared in advance. I wish to take all the exams at the Creation Master Association.\u201dNing Xuejun was a person with a gentle and calm temperament and wouldn\u2019t be surprised by anything she encountered. However, she was flabbergasted by Lin Yuan\u2019s words and only replied after a long time, \u201cYou can indeed participate in primary rank lifestyle-class occupation exams in the Creation Master exam. However, the Creation Master Association only has the exams for the Scholar, Fey Observer, and Spiritual Ingredient Analyst occupations. If you wish to participate in other occupation exams, you need to participate in other associations.\u201dNing Xuejun shook her head helplessly when looking at Lin Yuan as she spoke. It had been many years since anyone had come to the Creation Master Association to participate in other occupation exams apart from the Creation Master exam. Which of the participants here weren\u2019t amply prepared beforehand?This was Ning Xuejun\u2019s first time seeing such a sloppy person. However, Ning Xuejun was flabbergasted again after hearing the subsequent response.\u201cI wish to participate in those three occupation exams. It just so happens that the Creation Master Association is able to conduct all of them.\u201dNing Xuejun nearly burst out with vulgarities and felt that this youth in front of her must be some deity.She had never heard of anyone using these three knowledge occupations as proof to participate in the Creation Master exam. In order to participate in those three lifestyle-class occupation exams, one would need to memorize over 300 books. It was already heavy enough to carry all of those books, but that didn\u2019t matter. All the contents inside those books had to be memorized in order to pass the exam.How could a person be able to memorize all of those books at this young age?Even if someone used these knowledge occupations as proof, they could only use one of them. Ning Xuejun had never seen anyone using two of those occupations as proof.Most of the people that participated in the Creation Master exam would be spirit qi professionals. Who would be willing to spend so much time to learn such knowledge instead of increasing their strength?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59: A ProblemNing Xuejun still had an uncertain expression as she asked, \u201cYou are really not joking?\u201dLin Yuan nodded seriously.How can I be joking right now? Even if I wish to make a joke, I will also need the correct occasion, right?After hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s confirmation again, Ning Xuejun looked at him with a rather complicated expression.Ning Xuejun really wanted to ask if Lin Yuan was playing the fool.The Creation Master Association\u2019s exams would normally have lenient entry requirements but difficult passing requirements. People who came for the exam didn\u2019t need a high standard, however, it was extremely difficult to pass the exam.This was also how the Radiance Federation gave more attention to the occupation of Creation Master and didn\u2019t wish to lose out on any talented but unknown individuals.In Ning Xuejun\u2019s opinion now, Lin Yuan was a troublemaker.Normally, Ning Xuejun should be going through the protocol and bring Lin Yuan to go through the exams for the primary rank Scholar, Spiritual Ingredient Analyst, and Fey Observer occupations.However, Ning Xuejun didn\u2019t follow the normal protocol. If she were to follow the protocol and conduct all three knowledge occupation exams alone, it would definitely attract the upper echelons\u2019 attention.It was fine if Lin Yuan could pass all the exams, but if he couldn\u2019t, he would probably be considered as a troublemaker at the Creation Master Association. It was a small matter to create trouble at the Creation Master Association. It was highly possible that it might be recorded into Lin Yuan\u2019s resume as a Radiance Federation\u2019s citizen.Therefore, Ning Xuejun tried to persuade again, \u201cLooking at the information you filled in, your name is Lin Yuan, right? Lin Yuan, the questions that are given for these three lifestyle-class occupations are different when you attempt them at the respective associations than when attempted at the Creation Master Association. Since these three occupation exams are given to the Creation Master Association, the Creation Master Association would be in charge of the questions. Questions given by the Creation Master Association will be craftier and more difficult than other associations. So I advise that\u2014\u201dBefore Ning Xuejun could finish speaking, an aged voice echoed. \u201cLass, what is the reasoning for us to push participants to other associations when they are here at our Creation Master Association to attempt the knowledge occupation exam? And who said that the questions here are craftier? This old one has never tested anything outside of the exam\u2019s topics. All these questions are within the testable topics, and if the participant understands all the contents, they will naturally be able to answer them.\u201dThe old man sounded very calm and was rather benevolent.But when Ning Xuejun heard the old man\u2019s voice, she immediately turned around and said, \u201cVice President, aren\u2019t you nurturing Platinum Spiral-Toothed Sharks? Just let me handle these small matters.\u201dThe old man\u2019s face turned stern after hearing Ning Xuejun\u2019s words. \u201cJust call me grandfather. There is nothing to hide in the association, I will not give you special attention either! This old one is tired, can\u2019t I come out to have a breather? Little Xuejun doesn\u2019t care about grandfather at all.\u201dThe old man might not have mentioned Lin Yuan in his reply, but his eyes were carefully sizing up Lin Yuan.Ning Xuejun gestured with her hand and gave Lin Yuan an eye signal for him to leave quickly.Her grandfather might look benevolent, but his face-changing speed wasn\u2019t inferior to those face-changing opera artists.He had an eccentric temperament. If he encountered someone that he liked, he would do anything to protect that person. However, if he encountered someone he disliked, he wouldn\u2019t even think they were worth a single cent.Her grandfather might have an eccentric temperament, but Ning Xuejun knew that he hated people who weren\u2019t serious toward knowledge.Lin Yuan saw the eye signal from Ning Xuejun and responded with a smile of a passionate young man.At that moment, the old man said to Lin Yuan, \u201cLittle kid, you are rather confident, huh? You didn\u2019t do any preparations in advance before participating in the Creation Master exam. The three knowledge occupation exam questions set by the Creation Master Association aren\u2019t as easy to answer.\u201dWhile speaking, the old man\u2019s expression was rather calm, and it felt he was just nonchalantly having a casual chat.Lin Yuan heard the old man\u2019s words and replied indifferently, \u201cWhat the Vice President said is true. However, aren\u2019t all questions difficult if you don\u2019t know them, but once you know them, they aren\u2019t difficult?\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s answer made the old man take another glance at Lin Yuan. \u201cAren\u2019t all questions difficult if you don\u2019t know them, but once you know them, they aren\u2019t difficult, huh? What a great way to say it. If you are truly capable, you will be considered a young elite. But if you aren\u2019t truly capable and are using these words to muddle this old one, I will be furious.\u201dUpon hearing her grandfather\u2019s words, Ning Xuejun knew that he was being serious toward Lin Yuan. She looked at Lin Yuan with sympathy.Ning Xuejun was truly helpless when it came to her grandfather\u2019s temper and eccentric temperament.Lin Yuan was naturally filled with respect toward the Creation Master Association\u2019s Vice President. These people were the pioneers for the path of Creation Masters. Each evolution they contributed had produced plenty of high-ranked spirit qi professionals. The Radiance Federation\u2019s present great situation was definitely related to these pioneers.\u201cThis junior naturally is speaking the truth and doesn\u2019t dare to be sloppy.\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s words were very ordinary, but now that he wanted to attempt all three knowledge occupation exams, it felt rather arrogant and conceited.The old man didn\u2019t give any reaction but suddenly changed the topic.\u201cSince you are so confident, it must mean that you are rather well-learned. During the planet\u2019s prehistoric time, there were two lifeforms, the Megalodon and the Livyatan. These two species are considered the ocean\u2019s true dictator during the Tertiary period in history. They have been contesting each other for tens of millions of years and still couldn\u2019t settle an outcome of who was stronger. In your opinion, do you feel the Megalodon is stronger, or the Livyatan is stronger?\u201dThe old man\u2019s indifferent question made Ning Xuejun\u2019s expression change as she felt that it wasn\u2019t good.This question had been a constant debate even in the academic world, and there wasn\u2019t a definite answer. Both the species were top-class predators and dictated the ocean during the Tertiary period. They were ruler-class lifeforms and commanded the resources in the ocean during their time.In terms of attack power, the two lifeforms were almost on par, so the stronger one would be dependent on the individual combat strength, ability to grasp opportunities, and combat experience.It was a question that wouldn\u2019t be considered wrong no matter how Lin Yuan answered, however, Ning Xuejun\u2019s grandfather was a strong supporter of the Megalodon party. He was determined that the Megalodon was the ruler of the ocean during the Tertiary period.It was fine if Lin Yuan said it was the Megalodon, but if he said it was the Livyatan, her grandfather might just flip out and turn hostile here.As such, Ning Xuejun quickly said, \u201cGrandfather, you have been debating on this topic with Grandfather Zheng. What else is there to ask? You feel that the Megalodon is the ruler, right?\u201dNing Xuejun\u2019s statement was very subtle and ingenious as she was sending information to Lin Yuan. In Ning Xuejun\u2019s opinion, if Lin Yuan was smart enough, he would know how to answer this question.The old man had also heard the intention within Ning Xuejun\u2019s words and felt that his question was no longer interesting.Lin Yuan was proficient in ways of the world and naturally understood Ning Xuejun\u2019s intention. However, after showing respect to the old man and summarizing the knowledge in his mind, Lin Yuan considered for a moment and replied, \u201cI feel that the answer for this question has already been decided long ago.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60: An AnswerThe old man didn\u2019t expect to be able to hear a new perspective from Lin Yuan. Therefore, he was interested and asked nicely, \u201cYoung kid, speak then! This old one loves to hear analysis and opinions. Speak boldly.\u201dNing Xuejun was jumping as she listened. Before her grandfather flipped out, it seemed like he would always say the same words.Lin Yuan pondered for a moment and said, \u201cThis answer is actually derived because both the species had been eliminated during evolution, so they are both weak. Otherwise, we would still be able to see Megalodons and Livyatans in the ocean now. Even if the sharks in the ocean evolved back to the ancestry line and evolved more like the Megalodon, ultimately, they will never be Megalodons or Livyatans.\u201dThis perspective made the old man silent. All along, he would hear that either the Megalodon or the Livyatan was stronger or that both were equally great. Without any exceptions, people would be saying they were strong. This was actually the first time someone was saying they were weak.However, the mention of weak was from the angle of natural selection, and it wasn\u2019t wrong. Perhaps Lin Yuan\u2019s perspective was too fresh and unique, so the old man didn\u2019t burst out immediately even though someone said that the Megalodon was weak. Instead, he asked, \u201cWhy so?\u201d\u201cThe Megalodon and the Livyatan had conquered the ocean of the Tertiary period for tens of millions of years. However, be it the Livyatans or the Megalodons, they were too high at the top of the food chain, and it caused the other Tertiary period ocean creatures to have a slower evolution speed. As such, 65 million years ago, nature decided to use a meteorite to stop the contest between the two species without any room for negotiation. The impact welcomed the Quaternary period and a new period for the ocean. At the same time, they wiped out the Megalodons and Livyatans. Therefore, from the Creation Master\u2019s point of view, in terms of survival and evolution, the Megalodons and Livyatans are considered weak.\u201dLin Yuan spoke of his opinion, and this wasn\u2019t just based on the knowledge he learned from Genius. It was also Lin Yuan\u2019s knowledge from his previous lifetime and the comprehension of the fey\u2019s evolution in this lifetime.In the river of time, everything would turn into dust sooner or later.A successful evolution wasn\u2019t to allow one to reach the pinnacle and look down on every other living thing. A truly successful evolution was to understand how to overcome each calamity and disaster in order to survive for tens of millions or hundreds of millions of years. By allowing the species to continue was the true path of survival in evolution to achieve eternal victory.After hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s explanation, the old man stayed silent for a long time as though he was thinking through Lin Yuan\u2019s words.Ning Xuejun was no longer looking at Lin Yuan as though she was looking at a troublemaker. These were words that wouldn\u2019t come out from the mouth of a person who didn\u2019t have knowledge.Lin Yuan stood there quietly without showing any proud or impatient expression.At that moment, the old man suddenly laughed heartily and clapped. \u201cGreat!\u201dThe old man\u2019s voice was very loud and instantly attracted the attention of many. However, the old man didn\u2019t mind and said to Lin Yuan, \u201cYoung kid, your words are truly marvelous! However, why do you think the meteorite 65 million years ago would eliminate the Megalodons and Livyatans, but there are still shark and whale species existing today?\u201dWhen asking this question, the old man\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t contemplating anymore, and it was obvious that he knew the answer clearly. He was asking this question to test Lin Yuan. He wanted to see whether Lin Yuan\u2019s answer earlier came from his feelings, or it was a true understanding.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t contemplate this time and immediately said, \u201cActually, the higher a lifeform reaches in the food chain, the weaker it is. 65 million years ago, when the meteorite landed, it first impacted the algae. The death of the algae quickly devastated the krills. The krills are the main source of food for baleen whales and large filter-feeding fish species. The baleen whales and the large filter-feeding fish species are the same food source for the Megalodon and Livyatan. Standing at the apex of the food pyramid, they were the weakest cycle among the lifeforms, and that is the reason they were wiped out.\u201dWhen the old man heard how Lin Yuan clearly spoke of the answer in his heart, he looked at Lin Yuan and felt that he was very pleasant looking. A well-learned person would always cherish talented individuals, especially when the said individual was so young. It gave him a feeling of succession and made the old man very pleased.The old man turned to look at Ning Xuejun at the side and said, \u201cLass, the people attempting the exam will be coming out soon. You will be busy, I shall bring this kid and conduct the three knowledge occupation exams and see the standard of young people nowadays.\u201dNing Xuejun placed the form that Lin Yuan filled up in her grandfather\u2019s hand and secretly gave Lin Yuan a thumbs up.Lin Yuan responded politely by giving his thanks and entered a classroom together with the old man.The old man turned to look at Lin Yuan. \u201cI will be invigilating the exams later. In fact, it is very interesting to be an invigilator. A person\u2019s answers can determine three values.\u201dThe old man didn\u2019t care if Lin Yuan replied as he continued speaking. Perhaps, he was in a great mood, so he had been talking nonstop.\u201cA person\u2019s attitude when answering questions can show their mental state. The answers from a person\u2019s answer sheets can show their attitude toward knowledge. A person\u2019s procedure in answering questions can show their inner qualities. It has been ten years since this old one invigilated an exam!\u201dWhile speaking, the old man\u2019s eyes looked like he was reminiscing.Lin Yuan listened quietly.He felt that the Vice President of the Redbud City\u2019s Creation Master Association was someone that even the City Lord would need to be respectful, but he was actually a stubborn old man at times when talking about something in regards to knowledge.During the exam, the old man didn\u2019t hold back and handed all three exam papers to Lin Yuan at once.Lin Yuan became highly concentrated during the exam, and it felt as though everything in the outside world was unrelated to him.When Lin Yuan started answering the questions, the old man didn\u2019t feel anything, but after a short period of time, the old man actually had a delightful feeling as he watched Lin Yuan answering the questions.The pen tip was rustling on the paper with a consistent frequency that was neither hurried nor slow\u2014it was calm and collected.As for Lin Yuan, he had an unchanged expression as he answered each question on the paper in sequence. This was a calm attitude that the old man admired. At the same time, he was suddenly looking forward to seeing Lin Yuan\u2019s answers.When answering the questions, Lin Yuan understood why Ning Xuejun would say that the Creation Master Association\u2019s questions would be crafty.10% of the questions on the paper actually came from the remarks page of the books. There were even some questions that contained answers from the preface of the books.These questions were simply trying to make things difficult for the participants. However, it was still the same for Lin Yuan\u2014\u2019Aren\u2019t all questions difficult if you don\u2019t know them, but once you know them, they aren\u2019t difficult?\u2019Thus, Lin Yuan answered smoothly without hesitation and used just two hours to complete the exam papers for all three exams.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: GuidanceAs Lin Yuan was answering the questions, he didn\u2019t feel the flow of time. He successively answered from the first question to the last question, without any pause in between.In fact, when answering the questions, Lin Yuan was wearing the glasses that Genius had transformed into. At that moment, he was learning and sorting through the information.The knowledge learned by Genius still belonged to Genius, and if Genius didn\u2019t use Tool Transformation and transformed into a pair of glasses, Lin Yuan\u2019s mind wouldn\u2019t have the knowledge that Genius possessed.Lin Yuan knew that learning was an unending path. Lin Yuan was currently using some tricks to pass the exams on the lifestyle-class knowledge occupations. Naturally, this kind of knowledge was something that Lin Yuan had to learn slowly.Take the exam questions on this paper, for example. During the process of answering, Lin Yuan would be able to have a rough memory, and the transferred knowledge would subtly turn into his own knowledge after he wrote what he learned once.This was a gain. There were plenty of gains that were insignificant, but when all the small gains were accumulated, they would achieve a transformation.Elder Ning had been watching as Lin Yuan answered the questions, and he hadn\u2019t realized how much time had passed either.When he saw Lin Yuan standing up to hand over the exam papers, Elder Ning looked at the time and was shocked and couldn\u2019t understand what happened.Elder Ning had been watching Lin Yuan answering the questions and could see that Lin Yuan had answered them calmly. However, the time taken to answer all those questions was just too fast! Back when he had drafted up the questions, he had put in plenty of time and effort in order to make the questions tricky.Elder Ning couldn\u2019t believe that Lin Yuan had answered them so quickly, but he could also see that Lin Yuan\u2019s calm manner when answering the questions wasn\u2019t a pretense too.Elder Ning simply took over Lin Yuan\u2019s exam papers and read them. Lin Yuan stood in place as his mind was blank when he was in a deep state of learning. He enjoyed the feeling when he was in control of knowledge.Elder Ning read the papers, which had Lin Yuan\u2019s neat and pleasant handwriting. A good handwriting wasn\u2019t considered a big deal after the Spirit Qi Awakening, but it was able to give a good impression.The more Elder Ning read, the more surprised he was. These questions were all answered with a standard answer.First page, second page, third page\u2026From start to finish, Elder Ning couldn\u2019t find a single mistake. As such, Elder Ning started from the beginning and checked through again with detail and very seriously.However, after checking again, the result was still the same\u2014there wasn\u2019t a single mistake. In other words, full marks for all three lifestyle-class spirit qi occupations\u2019 primary exams. It was an unbelievable fact, but there was no way to dispute it.Had it not been for the fact that Elder Ning had set the questions himself and was certain that they hadn\u2019t been leaked out, he would think that Lin Yuan was holding onto the answer sheet to answer the questions.After staying silent for a long time, Elder Ning lifted his head and looked at Lin Yuan with grave eyes and admiration. His eyes were grave because this was simply too unbelievable. The admiration was because of Lin Yuan\u2019s results on the exams, and also how Lin Yuan had answered them with a calm attitude. It was also because of the level of detail in Lin Yuan\u2019s study that didn\u2019t allow Elder Ning to pick out any mistakes.Lin Yuan looked at Elder Ning and asked, \u201cElder Ning, can I participate in the Creation Master exam now?\u201dElder Ning shook his hand and said, \u201cGreat kid, heroes are truly born from the youth. You are truly capable. But you will not be able to take the Creation Master exam today. Leave your information here and just come over to participate in the Creation Master exam tomorrow.\u201dLin Yuan was rather confused.\u00a0I have already finished the exams for the knowledge spirit qi occupations. Why can\u2019t I participate in the Creation Master exam immediately? If I participate in the exam tomorrow, and if I wish to rush straight to become a Class 2 Creation Master, I might miss out on the appointment time with Big Sister Xin. I will not be able to pick up on any hidden wares.\u201cElder Ning, can\u2019t I take the exam today? I wish to try and see if I can complete the Class 1 Creation Master exam within two hours.\u201dElder Ning\u2019s mouth twitched as he looked at Lin Yuan with solemn eyes, and he nearly poured out praises from his mouth.\u201cKid, you are rather ambitious to complete the Class 1 Creation Master exam within two hours. Could it be that you wish to rush straight for Class 2 Creation Master?\u201dElder Ning might be speaking like this, but Lin Yuan\u2019s exam results made Elder Ning believe Lin Yuan a little. His intuition told him that Lin Yuan was really able to complete the Class 1 Creation Master exam within two hours.\u201cEven if that is the case, you still have to come again tomorrow. Who asked you to obtain such high marks in the exams and break the records for the Creation Master Association\u2019s knowledge spirit qi occupations\u2019 primary exams? Therefore, I need to report your results for the three exams to the lifestyle-class spirit qi occupations\u2019 associations. I have to go through the necessary process.\u201dLin Yuan nodded after hearing Elder Ning\u2019s reply.Just as he was about to leave, Elder Ning called out to him. \u201cDon\u2019t be in a hurry to leave. Follow me to the breeding room to see the Spiral-Toothed Sharks that I have nurtured. Take a look at this old man\u2019s research.\u201dLin Yuan had yet to pass the Creation Master exam, but it was obvious that Elder Ning had already treated Lin Yuan as a junior with great potential. Even his words had the implied meaning to offer guidance.In fact, it was due to Elder Ning\u2019s admiration for Lin Yuan. Otherwise, even if Lin Yuan was a Class 3 Creation Master, Elder Ning couldn\u2019t be bothered either.To become a Vice President in a city\u2019s Creation Master Association, one must definitely be a Class 4 Creation Master.There was a tradition in the Creation Master Association. There were no presidents in all cities\u2019 Creation Master Associations, even in the Radiance Federation\u2019s royal capital\u2019s Creation Master Association. The person with the highest level of authority would be the Vice President.Among the Creation Masters, there were three absolute experts, and they were the Class 5 Creation Masters at the pinnacle\u2014Bamboo Monarch, Chef Supreme, and Moon Empress.Bamboo Monarch and Chef Supreme were veteran Class 5 Creation Masters. They had been the earliest batch of Creation Masters since the Spirit Qi Awakening and stood at the peak of the Creation Masters.The Moon Empress rose up afterward and used her talents to become a Class 5 Creation Master. She had then concealed herself, and no one else knew about her progress.During the recent decade, the Moon Empress had been laying low. But since she had been given the title of empress, no one else had dared to proclaim themselves as empress.The Bamboo Monarch, Chef Supreme, and Moon Empress didn\u2019t wish to take on the role of a President in the Creation Master Association, so they were given the title of Honorary Elders.As such, to show respect to the Bamboo Monarch, Chef Supreme, and Moon Empress, the Creation Master Association didn\u2019t appoint any Presidents and only appointed Vice Presidents.For Lin Yuan to be admired and acknowledged by Elder Ning, it would definitely cause countless Creation Masters to be envious if it was made known.When an elder offered an invitation, Lin Yuan naturally didn\u2019t dare to refuse. In addition, he was very interested in Platinum feys. To be invited by Elder Ning to his breeding room to observe was truly a pleasant surprise for Lin Yuan.The Creation Master\u2019s breeding room was considered a private territory, and it was rare for outsiders to be invited inside, especially to observe a Platinum fey that was being nurtured.Lin Yuan followed Elder Ning into the latter\u2019s breeding room. As soon as Lin Yuan entered the room, he could smell a unique smell that could only be found from seawater. There was also a violent pressure that enveloped the room.The scenery in the breeding room was truly a surprise for Lin Yuan. It was massive, and when Lin Yuan took a glance, he could see a huge pool that had a width of close to 1,000 meters. It was just like a small-scaled artificial sea.The intimidating pressure from the sea felt as though it had mighty attack power.At that moment, Lin Yuan felt Elder Ning circulating the spirit qi. Three Willpower Runes were emitted from the body and released powerful spiritual power waves.The spiritual power had an aura that allowed Lin Yuan to know that Elder Ning was a Class 4 Creation Master and also a king-class expert.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 62": "Chapter 62: Spiral-Toothed SharkA king-class expert\u2019s prowess was being completely displayed at this moment.Lin Yuan felt that he was like a lonely boat in the middle of the ocean and might be engulfed by the waves at any moment. This was because Elder Ning had intentionally withdrawn his prowess from Lin Yuan. Otherwise, a king-class prowess would instantly pressure Lin Yuan to the ground.As Elder Ning released his prowess, a massive shadow appeared in the small-scale manmade sea.The bright silver dorsal fin had dark red patterns, and it looked just like a sharp sword that was splitting the surface of the sea.A massive body that was ten meters in length leaped out of the sea surface before smashing back down again, causing a huge wave.When the current rushed over, Lin Yuan immediately staggered and nearly fell.Elder Ning then gestured to Lin Yuan and gave a simple introduction. \u201cThis is my newly nurtured Spiral-Toothed Shark.\u201dThe Spiral-Toothed Shark had already swum near their vicinity. The teeth of this giant shark were in the shape of a spiraled wheel. It wasn\u2019t only the case, as the upper jaw also had a vertical row of sharp teeth. When used together with the lower spiraled teeth, it would form scissors that could slice and cut.This allowed the Spiral-Toothed Shark to turn into a killing machine in the sea, using its spiraled teeth and front teeth to sever and slice the lifeforms in front of it.This Spiral-Toothed Shark didn\u2019t just have special traits of the prehistoric Megalodon, but it even had the complimenting traits of the Edestus. It was simply a fascinating breeding result toward the ancestry line.Lin Yuan looked at the Spiral-Toothed Shark while leaning his ear toward Elder Ning. It was obvious that Elder Ning had other things to tell him other than showing him the Spiral-Toothed Shark.\u201cKid, I have already nurtured this Spiral-Toothed Shark to Platinum X/Legend, but I didn\u2019t allow it to evolve to diamond-grade yet. It is because I want to guide its mutation toward the direction of Megalodon at the juncture of diamond-grade.\u201dAfter speaking, Elder Ning brought over a platinum-grade fey storage box from the side and took out many glass test tubes. He then opened up the test tubes and started to pour the golden-red fluid into the Spiral-Toothed Shark\u2019s mouth.Lin Yuan could recognize this golden-red fluid.\u00a0Isn\u2019t this a Platinum dragon beast\u2019s blood?According to Big Sister Xin\u2019s price quotation, Platinum dragon beast\u2019s blood cost 2,000 Radiance dollars per drop. Each of these test tubes had around 100 drops. Elder Ning had already poured in 10 test tubes, and they would cost at least 2,000,000 Radiance dollars. Lin Yuan had a new mindset of what was luxurious.While Elder Ning was feeding the Spiral-Toothed Shark, he explained, \u201cThe Megalodon lived in the sea by hunting dragon beasts. Using dragon beast blood to feed the Spiral-Toothed Shark can guide it toward the mutation of the Megalodon. The word \u2018Creation\u2019 in Creation Master might mean that there is nothing we cannot do, but you need to remember that all lifeforms\u2019 evolutions have traces that have to be followed.\u201dLin Yuan was carefully pondering over Elder Ning\u2019s words while looking at the Spiral-Toothed Shark. He was thinking that if the Spiral-Toothed Shark evolved toward Megalodon\u2019s direction again, its size would surely burst exponentially. At the same time, it would grow a full mouth of giant teeth apart from the spiral teeth and vertical row of teeth.This would allow the Spiral-Toothed Shark to slice and also rip. Lin Yuan didn\u2019t dare to imagine how much stronger the Spiral-Toothed Shark would be by then.After feeding the Spiral-Toothed Shark, Elder Ning led Lin Yuan out of the breeding room while Lin Yuan repeatedly pondered the meaning in Elder Ning\u2019s words.All of a sudden, Elder Ning spoke again. \u201cA Creation Master\u2019s job isn\u2019t just to create and evolve life, it is also to save lives. You may leave now, come earlier tomorrow for the exam.\u201dLin Yuan nodded and bade farewell. When he exited the Creation Master Association, he realized that it was already rather dark.Inside the Creation Master Association, Elder Ning was personally writing a letter and said to the assistant who was standing beside him, \u201cDeliver this letter directly to the region lord residence and hand it over to the City Lordess Ling Xiao.\u201dAfter the assistant left, Elder Ning lamented softly while filled with expectations. \u201cLin Yuan, there will be a chance for you to rise to the top tomorrow. It will be determined if you can pass the Class 2 Creation Master exam.\u201dLin Yuan didn\u2019t know the reason for the Creation Master Association\u2019s reformation, but as the Vice President of Redbud City\u2019s Creation Master Association, Elder Ning knew.The Creation Master Association\u2019s reformation was due to the Moon Empress\u2019 plan on accepting her first apprentice.It had been many years since the Creation Master Association in the Redbud City had produced a true talent. It was unknown if the Redbud City\u2019s Creation Master Association could produce a shining star for the Radiance Federation.Lin Yuan immediately headed for the Redbud Intermediate Spirit Qi Academy. Lin Yuan called Chu Ci\u2019s phone number on the car, but he didn\u2019t expect someone to pick up the call after ringing for half a minute. It wasn\u2019t Chu Ci. It was another familiar voice, and it was none other than Teacher Bao.\u201cYou are Chu Ci\u2019s elder brother, right? Chu Ci is injured and is currently going through treatment. If there isn\u2019t any urgent matter, I will ask Chu Ci to return your call after she receives treatment.\u201dWhen Teacher Bao was speaking, Lin Yuan could still vaguely hear crashing and smashing sounds, as though there was a fight.Lin Yuan asked with a worried tone, \u201cTeacher, why is Chu Ci injured? I am arriving at the academy soon.\u201dAfter hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s question, Teacher Bao answered calmly, \u201cChu Ci pulled the muscles on both her arms because she was blocking an attack. Our academy has been assigned with a Silver healing-type fey, and she will be treated quickly. As a senior in the family, you don\u2019t need to worry. It is inevitable to have injuries during live combat class. Almost every student would suffer some injuries during the live combat class. This is the only way to build their live combat skill.\u201dTeacher Bao\u2019s statement made Lin Yuan relax. At the same time, Lin Yuan felt that Chu Ci was injured because the Sharp Iron Horn Bull wasn\u2019t a pure defense-type fey. If the Sharp Iron Horn Bull didn\u2019t have the exclusive skill Sacrifice, it would be the same as an offense-type fey.If I prepared a traditional defense-type fey for Chu Ci, she might not have gotten injured.Defense-type spirit qi professionals always had a title, and they were called the thickest armor and the best at enduring attacks.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t wish to see Chu Ci getting injured, so he suddenly thought of an idea to forge Chu Ci into an iron bucket. That wasn\u2019t enough, though. She must not just be an iron bucket, but one that could prevent vibrations.Lin Yuan would only be at ease when he forged Chu Ci into an iron bucket.It just so happens that Chu Ci is able to contract her second fey. I shall just prepare Chu Ci\u2019s second fey before the holidays.\u201cTeacher Bao, I am at the academy\u2019s entrance. I wish to enter the infirmary to see Chu Ci.\u201d\u201cWait at the entrance for a moment. Chu Ci needs just a few more minutes for a complete treatment. It just happens that it is dinner time too, so I will allow her to meet you at the academy entrance. You two can have dinner together.\u201dAfter hanging up the call, Lin Yuan stood at the entrance and contemplated what defense-type fey he should prepare for Chu Ci.The primary rank Fey Observer knowledge allowed Lin Yuan to quickly lock onto a few defense-type feys.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: As an Elder BrotherThere were countless species of defense-type feys. If someone did a serious study, they would find at least one million species of defense-type feys. But when each species of fey evolved, it might learn similar abilities, or it might be completely different.It was even rarer for exclusive skills to be the same, so one must be very cautious when choosing a fey. After all, the combination between feys was a spirit qi professional\u2019s true trump card and power.While thinking like this, Lin Yuan had a headache. He felt that feys that were suitable for Chu Ci were all rare, and they required some direction nurturing.Since Lin Yuan had a method to expedite the evolution of feys, he preferred to pick a Normal fey for Chu Ci. Feys that were nurtured from a young age and constantly evolved would have certain aspects that were stronger than same grade feys when at higher grades. It would also have a better mutual understanding with the spirit qi professional.As such, there wasn\u2019t a reason why Lin Yuan shouldn\u2019t pick a low-grade fey and nurture it for Chu Ci.Just as Lin Yuan was pondering, he suddenly felt a pat on his arm, followed by a pleasant voice. \u201cLin Yuan, why are you here to visit me?\u201dSince the previous time Chu Ci had parted with Lin Yuan, she had been under the impression that she would only be able to see Lin Yuan during the holidays. She didn\u2019t expect Lin Yuan to visit her again so soon.Lin Yuan took a closer look at Chu Ci first and moved her arms around. When he realized that she was indeed fully healed, he relaxed and said, \u201cI am here to participate in the Creation Master exam. It is also convenient for me to bring you out for a meal. Let\u2019s go. Didn\u2019t you say you wanted to eat barbequed meat the previous time? Let\u2019s find a barbeque shop.\u201dAfter speaking, Lin Yuan pulled Chu Ci toward the streets and away from the Redbud Intermediate Spirit Qi Academy.From time to time, female students would come over to flirt with Lin Yuan, making him rather exhausted after dealing with them.Chu Ci let out a sweet smile and asked, \u201cThen, can I order one plate of mutton?\u201dLin Yuan used his hand to gently pat on Chu Ci\u2019s head and said, \u201cIsn\u2019t fish your favorite? Why do you still want to eat mutton? Later, I will grill fish for you at the barbeque shop.\u201dChu Ci stuck out her tongue. She might know that her family was rather wealthy now, but she still wasn\u2019t used to it yet. After all their young years\u2019 suffering and hard times, the habits were already engraved in their bones.Of course, it didn\u2019t mean that Chu Ci gave money huge importance. On the contrary, she hadn\u2019t held back on the spending of the 10,000 Federation dollars that Lin Yuan had transferred to her.The metallic food that she fed to the Sharp Iron Horn Bull was superior among the food meant for a Bronze Sharp Iron Horn Bull.Presently, nothing much was left from the 10,000 Federation dollars.There was an old saying, \u201cChildren from poor families would be responsible household heads much earlier.\u201dChu Ci wasn\u2019t a household head, but she understood how the world worked. When looking up from the bottom, the eyes would be filled with reality\u2019s harshness. While living in this harsh reality, Chu Ci understood who she was going to rely on in this world. She, too, understood what she had to do in order to survive better in this world and make Lin Yuan happy.It was to study well and increase her strength. If she could become a formidable individual, she would be able to help Lin Yuan, her elder brother.Therefore, after parting with Lin Yuan previously, Chu Ci hadn\u2019t taken any side jobs to earn money. She had devoted all her efforts to her academics.At that moment, Chu Ci had this indescribable ease and joy when she was looking at Lin Yuan. Chu Ci\u2019s ease didn\u2019t come from the change into a wealthier lifestyle\u2014it was due to Lin Yuan\u2019s recovered body. Her joy came from the fact that she and Lin Yuan had persisted until now and never separated even in this harsh world.Lin Yuan called for a car and asked after boarding the car, \u201cChu Ci, how do you feel when you are using the Sharp Iron Horn Bull? What direction do you wish to develop in regards to your next fey selection?\u201dLin Yuan could just pick Chu Ci\u2019s second fey for her, but he still wanted to respect Chu Ci\u2019s opinion for the general direction.After being asked by Lin Yuan, Chu Ci\u2019s face suddenly changed, and she waved her fist with a little anger. \u201cThe Sharp Iron Horn Bull is especially good, and I like it a lot. But a few of my classmates gave me a nickname\u2026 Great Iron Bull! They are really too much!\u201dLin Yuan involuntarily slapped his forehead after hearing Chu Ci\u2019s response.\u00a0When I was picking the fey previously, I only cared about the fey\u2019s strength and didn\u2019t consider the appearance.Firstly, the conditions back were restricted. Secondly, the Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s exclusive skill, Sacrifice, was truly a divine skill in Lin Yuan\u2019s opinion.The Sacrifice skill was something that could be used by the fey from start to end. As the fey got stronger, the Sacrifice skill would only become better. If Lin Yuan hadn\u2019t picked the Sharp Iron Horn Bull back then, it would truly have been a waste.In addition, after the Spirit Qi Awakening, strength was a person\u2019s roots. Everything else was just a useless display of beauty and couldn\u2019t even be considered help in time of need.Given his previous life\u2019s memories, Lin Yuan\u2019s mental state was no longer like a hot-blooded youth\u2019s. As an elder brother, he should bring his younger sister along and take revenge by teaching a lesson to those people who had given her that nickname. However, Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t do so.Chu Ci was now an independent person, and in order to mix in into the society, everything that happened was something that she had to experience herself\u2014only with experience would one grow.Unless Chu Ci was in a true crisis, Lin Yuan would disregard everything and step in.After Chu Ci finished her statement, she immediately followed up. \u201cThe Sharp Iron Horn Bull is incredible. Presently, even the seniors might not be able to defeat me.\u201dWhen speaking of her own results, Chu Ci was delighted. She was a very humble and reserved person, but she was now speaking of her results in hopes of sharing the joy with Lin Yuan.Seeing Chu Ci\u2019s confidence and how pleased she was to talk about her live combat lesson\u2019s experience, Lin Yuan could only feel contentment and happiness in his heart.The truth had proven that his insistence on sending Chu Ci to the academy no matter the suffering was the right choice.After the conversation, Lin Yuan and Chu Ci decided on the next defense-type fey that Chu Ci was going to form a contract with.This time, Lin Yuan and Chu Ci\u2019s ideologies were rather matching. It was for Chu Ci to form a contract with a traditional and pure defense-type fey.Furthermore, it wouldn\u2019t be like the Sharp Iron Horn Bull, an offense-type fey that was wearing a layer of defense-type skin and tricking others.During this meal, Lin Yuan and Chu Ci had eaten three grilled fish.After the Spirit Qi Awakening, the ocean was now even wider and deeper, making the level of danger immeasurable.Although the Xia Region was beside a port, even with such a great location, fish prices were still astronomical compared to meat.In the past, even when celebrating the new year, Lin Yuan would only go to the market to buy a normal-grade fish\u2019s head for Chu Ci and then make fish head stew. If they really wanted fish\u2019s flesh, Lin Yuan would probably have to starve and tighten his belt for one month after the new year celebration.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "Chapter 64: Redbud City\u2019s Rare Lifeform PavilionPresently, with Lin Yuan\u2019s earning speed of Radiance dollars, eating a few fish was truly not a big deal.After finishing the meal, Lin Yuan transferred 50 Radiance dollars to Chu Ci\u2019s Star Web account. This was the first time Chu Ci had seen so much money, but when she took a glance at Lin Yuan, she felt the warmth in her heart and felt at ease.\u201cChu Ci, the Sharp Iron Horn Bull has to eat more now. Use various metals to enhance the defense of the Sharp Iron Horn Bull\u2019s skin and its horn\u2019s destructive power. After a period of time, I will mail you a pot of Silver Usnea. The Sharp Iron Horn Bull is a herbivorous fey, and apart from the metals that you feed it, complementing it with the Silver Usnea will make the Sharp Iron Horn Bull even stronger.\u201dChu Ci nodded.No thanks were needed between siblings. If Chu Ci had to thank her elder brother, then she would have countless things to thank him for from the age of six.Previously, Teacher Bao had asked Chu Ci to strive hard to obtain the academy\u2019s recommendation within the year and, before the end of the first year, to become a seeded participant of the Redbud Hundred.Chu Ci constantly reminded herself of this in her heart.After returning, Chu Ci was planning to apply for a solitary room in the academy. Lin Yuan had given her a shocking amount of resources, and it wasn\u2019t suitable for her to show it in a sharing room.After successfully applying for a solitary room, Chu Ci would work extra hard and use all her efforts to strive and take the title of a seeded participant in the Redbud Hundred. After being selected to join the Redbud Hundred, she would then strive for the dream of all students in the Radiance Federation\u2014the Hundred Sequence!This was Chu Ci\u2019s ambition.An insignificant person was like a firefly that would want itself to just be an instantaneous burst of light for a short span of February.Chu Ci was very determined with her ambition, and it was also her objective. A small firefly was trying to become an undying radiance.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t continue giving Chu Ci instructions as he was at ease and proud of his young sister.Chu Ci and Lin Yuan had been shopping around and bought some delicious snacks and fruits. These were all specially picked by Lin Yuan, and he asked for Chu Ci to give them to Teacher Bao as a sign of gratitude.While walking around, they just happened to enter the Redbud City\u2019s Rare Lifeform Pavilion.The Rare Lifeform Pavilion had been around since the Spirit Qi Awakening, and it was the biggest and also the only auction organization on the Star Web. It was established by the Radiance Federation\u2019s officials.Apart from the Star Web\u2019s Rare Lifeform Pavilion, a large-scale auction would be held every once in a while.On normal days, if anyone wanted to sell off their items through the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s auction, they would need to pay a certain fee before putting them on sale in the Rare Lifeform Pavilion.During a special period of time, the item would be bid by others. The Rare Lifeform Pavilion would only show the highest price at the moment, so if anyone else wanted to obtain the item, they would need to bid again.Of course, they could also contact the seller and use a trading method to conduct a private transaction. If that was the case, the fee that was paid to put the item on the Rare Lifeform Pavilion wouldn\u2019t be refunded.Most of the people didn\u2019t care about the fee. If anyone paid the fee to place their item on sale in the Rare Lifeform Pavilion and had a special intention, they would normally leave a note to conduct a special transaction.The fees they paid were just to make use of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion as a platform to complete the transaction.The Rare Lifeform Pavilion on the Star Web was different as the merchandise on the Star Web was all interconnected.In the Radiance Federation\u2019s main cities, the items for sale on the Rare Lifeform Pavilion would have to be auctioned, and it was the same as on the Star Web. However, the feys listed in the main city\u2019s Rare Lifeform Pavilions weren\u2019t connected with other pavilions. Each local pavilion\u2019s items were all sold by the locals.As compared to the Star Web, the standard and audit for actual shops would be much harsher. It was rather rare for general items to qualify for auction in the Rare Lifeform Pavilion.Lin Yuan patted Chu Ci\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go inside and take a look.\u201dAs for most of the feys and spiritual ingredients in the Rare Lifeform Pavilion, Lin Yuan admitted that he wouldn\u2019t be able to afford them. However, there was a specified section in the actual shops that the Star Web didn\u2019t have.The section would be selling rarely seen Normal and Elite feys. It was the section that Lin Yuan wanted to visit tonight.Chu Ci looked rather reserved as she had never stepped into this place before.\u201cWe are just taking a look. You might just find something suitable to be your second fey.\u201dAfter entering the Rare Lifeform Pavilion, one would need to verify their identity with the Star Web Card.After verifications, Lin Yuan and Chu Ci were now able to shop around the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s first floor without obstructions. In order to go to the second floor, one would need a certain rank in their spirit qi occupation.For combat-class spirit qi professionals, they would need to be at least C-rank. For lifestyle-class spirit qi professionals, they would need to be at least Class 2.If one was a Creation Master, even a Class 1 Creation Master would be free to enter the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s third floor.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t a Creation Master yet, and none of the conditions were enough for him to enter the second floor either.It just so happened that the section Lin Yuan wanted to visit was on the first floor. Therefore, he led Chu Ci toward the special section.The first floor of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion was very crowded. After all, there weren\u2019t any restrictions, and one could move around freely after scanning their Star Web Card. The first floor of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion gave Lin Yuan a feeling like he was shopping around in a temple fair.Lin Yuan had a matured soul from another world, so he had quickly adapted to this world because he had a home, a young sister, and responsibilities in this world. Another important reason was due to the fact that this world wasn\u2019t dark.Those at the bottom might have difficulties, and there were evil people, but this world wasn\u2019t cold and indifferent. Take the Rare Lifeform Pavilion, for example, they were a government transaction organization that had great standards, but they still opened up the first floor to all Radiance Federation citizens. Even if one wasn\u2019t a spirit qi professional, they would be able to enter after registration.This was a kind of attitude.\u201cLin Yuan, look at that little white fox! It has two tails and is so cute! But I have never seen this fey before in class.\u201dLin Yuan looked at the direction Chu Ci had pointed and recognized the fey. It wasn\u2019t a little fox, but a Two-Tailed Snow Ferret.The Two-Tailed Snow Ferret looked cute as it was lazing in the fey storage box. However, it was an extremely rare offense- and ice-type fey. It would only occasionally appear in the forest of the extreme northern glacier regions.If Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t wearing the glasses transformed from Genius and possessed the True Data ability, he wouldn\u2019t be able to recognize that this cute little critter was a Two-Tailed Snow Ferret.The Two-Tailed Snow Ferret\u2019s Freeze ability was only found in a few Silver elemental-type feys, making it a pinnacle existence.This little Two-Tailed Snow Ferret\u2019s price was already raised to a price of 1,100 Radiance dollars.In terms of the price, the fey\u2019s grade would have a great impact, but it was in regards to feys that were frequently traded in the market.As for the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s feys that people might not even see in their entire lifetime, the price and grade didn\u2019t have a huge relation.After all, people who could afford such feys would naturally have the ability to search for Creation Masters to evolve the feys further.For Silver feys like the Two-Tailed Snow Ferret, it wasn\u2019t within Lin Yuan\u2019s consideration.At that moment, Lin Yuan noticed a person wearing a mask and squatting there.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Butterfly CocoonsThe Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s first floor was as lively as the temple fair that Lin Yuan would visit in his previous life. Most of the people walking around had happy faces.As a matter of fact, most of the people shopping around the first floor were those that couldn\u2019t harness spirit qi. The spirit qi professionals were the minority here.The Rare Lifeform Pavilions\u2019 first floors in the Radiance Federation\u2019s main cities would always be the place where ordinary people could get closest to spirit qi professionals.Every display store would have a fey seller by the side.The Two-Tailed Snow Ferret\u2019s seller was currently introducing the fey to a young loli and her mother.One could see that the young loli was genuinely fond of this cute Two-Tailed Snow Ferret. However, it was evidently not suitable to be contracted as a first fey.The spirit qi professionals\u2019 spiritual energy would constantly become stronger. Nonetheless, due to the first fey contract\u2019s limits, it could only be a Bronze fey.If they wished to go further and contract a Silver fey, the contractor might not be able to take it and would receive a backlash from the fey.Within the Radiance Federation, there were cases of high-grade feys being recklessly contracted, resulting in a backlash. It caused the spirit qi professionals\u2019 spiritual energy to collapse.Once the spiritual energy collapsed, the person would become a vegetable. Even if one could find a high-ranked spirit qi professional to awaken those in a vegetative state, their spiritual spatial zone\u2019s damage could never be repaired.It would cause a spirit qi professional to become an ordinary person who could only feel spirit qi but couldn\u2019t form a contract with a fey.The masked man sitting on the ground gave Lin Yuan a feeling that he didn\u2019t really fit into the surrounding environment.The surrounding environment was very relaxed and carefree. However, the masked man was sitting cross-legged. It might be hard to see his face clearly, but he was emitting a particularly gloomy aura.The gloomy aura had a trace of emptiness and numbness.This was a feeling that Lin Yuan was rather familiar with. It was the same when Lin Yuan had realized that he couldn\u2019t sense spirit qi. At the same time, his mental strength had been so weak to the point he was in despair.However, their family had undergone a major change, and he had to bring Chu Ci around to seek survival. There wasn\u2019t a chance for Lin Yuan to immerse himself in his own world. As such, he had suppressed his despair into the bottom of his heart. That despair had finally been resolved only until recently when his body recovered.Of course, Lin Yuan would look at the masked man directly due to the display shelf beside him. There were four cocoons wrapped in layers of silk.Three of the four cocoons were about the size of a red date, while the other cocoon was around the size of half a fist. The white silk was weaved together neatly and with a certain pattern. The red-date-sized cocoons\u2019 silk was in different shades of white, while the fist-sized cocoon had a light green color.These cocoons had caught Lin Yuan\u2019s attention because he had activated the True Data ability.These four cocoons were all precious.One of the red-date-sized white cocoons might look very ordinary, but according to True Data\u2019s information, it was nurturing a Blue Flash Butterfly.It had to be known that the Blue Flash Butterfly wasn\u2019t well-known among the Radiance Federation citizens. It was a Normal fey, had a bright blue color, and its wings would flash with light when it flew. It was due to the blue scale powder on their wings. Therefore, instead of saying they were flying, it would be better to say they were flashing.The Blue Flash Butterfly may not be commonly known, but its evolved form, the Blue Light Goddess Butterfly, was crowned as the sixth most beautiful fey among the top ten.It was also the only insect-type fey among the top ten most beautiful feys.In fact, there was always a dispute about the rank of the Blue Light Goddess Butterfly. During the rankings, the popularity of the Blue Light Goddess Butterfly had been among the top three.However, the Blue Light Goddess Butterfly only possessed a basic ability that was strong, while its high-grade abilities were all rather useless. As such, it could only rank No.6 even though its popularity was among the top three.This incident still created a lot of dissatisfaction among the voters.Lin Yuan just so happened that he wanted the Blue Flash Butterfly\u2019s basic ability, Silence Scale Powder. When the Blue Flash Butterfly\u2019s scale powder was released, it had the Silence effect.Silence was a very powerful control-type ability.When feys evolved, there were only two different directions. One was toward the ancestry line, while the other was toward spiritual mutation.Spiritual mutation feys were all treading on the path of magic attacks. Silence Scale Powder was a counter for spiritual mutation feys.When enveloped by the Silence Scale Powder, feys wouldn\u2019t be able to release their abilities. However, the Silence Scale Powder was not invincible, as it couldn\u2019t counter exclusive skills.In fact, if the opposing fey was able to disperse the Blue Flash Butterfly\u2019s Silence Scale Powder, the affected fey would be able to restore its abilities immediately.Despite the case, the Silence Scale Powder was still among the strongest control abilities.Lin Yuan had been deliberating over the next fey for Morbius to use its Spirit Lock. He had thought of many options, but he had never considered the Blue Flash Butterfly.The reason was simple and straightforward\u2014Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have the capability to obtain a Blue Flash Butterfly.But now, the cocoons in the masked man\u2019s display shelf had given Lin Yuan the thought.Butterfly-species feys were part of the Order Lepidoptera, which was one of the four major orders among the insect species. They were considered the true royalty among the insect-type feys.After the Spirit Qi Awakening, the butterfly-species feys had evolved under the influence of spirit qi, allowing them to become bigger and more beautiful.It also allowed the butterflies\u2019 natural enemies to capture them easily. Thus, 90% of the Order Lepidoptera feys had gone extinct during the Spirit Qi Awakening. The remaining 10% had also been gradually eliminated due to various reasons. It was also why butterfly-species feys rarely appeared and were very hard to find.The beauty and rarity of the butterfly-species feys made their price high for a hollow reason.Had it not been for only a few rare butterfly-species feys that were dominant and that most of them weren\u2019t adept in combat, the butterfly-species feys\u2019 prices would not have been this high.As such, Lin Yuan hadn\u2019t dared to even consider the Blue Flash Butterfly\u2019s basic ability as a choice before this.The butterfly-species feys had a special trait\u2014it was impossible to determine the butterfly species when they were still in their cocoons. If some other method was used to check the butterfly species, it might just cause development problems to the butterfly-species fey.This was also the reason why no butterfly-species feys still in their cocoons appeared in the market.Coincidentally, among the four cocoons was an Earth Powder Butterfly, which was extremely suitable for Chu Ci.The Earth Powder Butterfly wasn\u2019t rare, but it had an extreme variation during its evolution path. Hence, when the Earth Powder Butterfly evolved, its evolution direction was truly varied.One of the evolution directions was the one Lin Yuan planned for Chu Ci.When the Earth Powder Butterfly evolved with pure spirit qi until bronze-grade, it would evolve into the Vajra Butterfly. Once it became a Vajra Butterfly and fed with special gemstones and spirit qi, it would evolve into the Jadeite Butterfly.If the Jadeite Butterfly had the chance to reach the Fantasy Breed realm, it could even evolve into the legendary Tourmaline Emperor Butterfly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 66": "Chapter 66: MishapsLin Yuan pulled Chu Ci toward the masked man\u2019s counter.Before encountering it, Lin Yuan hadn\u2019t even dared to choose the Blue Flash Butterfly. He hadn\u2019t put the Blue Flash Butterfly within his consideration during his contemplation because of the rarity. However, since he found one now, and it was a coincidental encounter, it was definitely a great opportunity.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have a reason not to grab this opportunity. Thus, he had already silently decided to obtain this Blue Flash Butterfly no matter what.Chu Ci could see that Lin Yuan\u2019s expression had turned serious when he was walking toward the four cocoons. She simply followed Lin Yuan silently and carefully observed the four cocoons. She couldn\u2019t see anything abnormal with them, but she knew that the cocoons were extraordinary because Lin Yuan viewed them with such seriousness.\u201cCould I ask for the price of the four cocoons?\u201d Lin Yuan asked.When the voice reached the masked man\u2019s ears, he didn\u2019t stand up and just responded indifferently, \u201cI will only accept if you take them all. You just have to pay me 120 Radiance dollars, and you can take them all.\u201dLin Yuan was astonished. Although 120 Radiance dollars wasn\u2019t a price that was enough to purchase a Blue Flash Butterfly, it was still too expensive for cocoons.After all, it was impossible to check what the cocoons contained. Each cocoon was like a fortune bag as it was unknown what would fly out of the cocoon. As such, it was extremely rare for cocoons to be sold on the market.Lin Yuan might want the Blue Flash Butterfly, but he wouldn\u2019t immediately decide to purchase these four cocoons.Just as he was thinking of how to counteroffer, a middle-aged lady beside Lin Yuan suddenly said, \u201cYoung man, don\u2019t be cheated! This person has been here for several days. It is unknown what backhanded methods he has actually used to set up a stall with four butterfly cocoons! How can butterfly cocoons be qualified to be sold in the Rare Lifeform Pavilion!? The other stalls are only selling butterfly cocoons for 50,000 Federation dollars, but this person is selling one cocoon for 30 Radiance dollars. Will a Bronze fey fly out of it directly?\u201dThe middle-aged lady was obviously afraid that Lin Yuan might be swindled and had spoken slightly louder. Numerous people in the vicinity started to look in their direction.At that moment, Lin Yuan heard the masked man\u2019s exhausted and hoarse voice. \u201cThese four cocoons are all butterfly cocoons. They all came from the depths of the Endless Forest.\u201dThe masked man spoke indifferently and stopped talking afterward.The middle-aged lady beside Lin Yuan was even angrier now as she said, \u201cThe shortest tree in the depths of the Endless Forest is already 30 meters in height. The cocoons are hidden under the leaves of those giant trees. How can you even find them?\u201dWhen Lin Yuan heard the masked man\u2019s words, he felt an obstinate tone within those words stimulated his heart. The explanation might be obstinate and was weak in strength, but it was lonesome and abnormally determined.Clamor echoed in the surroundings, constantly getting louder. This store was now the liveliest place on the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s first floor.All things in this world couldn\u2019t escape a phenomenon like the eye of a hurricane. It was how everyone was gathered in the same direction. The store was now the eye of the hurricane, and it was constantly attracting everyone.At that moment, a Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s attendant wearing special clothing approached. When the attendant took a look at the situation, he immediately said to the middle-aged lady, who was chattering nonstop, \u201cAuntie, I know you might be kindhearted, but the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s stores are all approved by the Rare Lifeform Pavilion.\u201dWhen the middle-aged lady heard that, and mostly due to the Rare Lifeform Pavilion as a guarantee, she didn\u2019t speak in a tone as though she was speaking with a swidler. However, she still pointed at the four cocoons and asked, \u201cWhy are these four butterfly cocoons qualified to be in the Rare Lifeform Pavilion? Isn\u2019t it impossible to check the butterfly species while they are still metamorphosing within the cocoon?\u201dThe middle-aged lady\u2019s words stumped the staff member as he didn\u2019t know what to say for a moment.\u00a0I cannot possibly say that the management asked me to provide special treatment, right?The staff member was also feeling doubtful as to why the management would provide such great treatment to a depressed masked man. They had even broken a common rule regarding the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s first floor by making an exception.Could it be because of wealth and authority? But it\u2019s obviously impossible with the likes of this masked man. What else could it be? I really cannot think of a reason.At that moment, the masked man\u2019s mobile phone rang. He picked up the call, and his body immediately tensed up.Lin Yuan might not be able to see the masked man\u2019s face, but he knew that it was definitely not calm.After the call, the masked man looked at Lin Yuan and said, \u201cIf you wish to buy them tomorrow, come at the same time in the evening. I can give you proof that I obtained these butterfly cocoons in the depths of the Endless Forest.\u201dThe masked man then left the Rare Lifeform Pavilion in a hurry.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect that his slight hesitation had caused so many mishaps.Now that the seller had left, it was obvious that the trade wasn\u2019t going to happen. Since the masked man had already said he would be there the next day, Lin Yuan decided to return tomorrow.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t really have peace of mind since he hadn\u2019t completed the trade and obtained the Blue Flash Butterfly. At the same time, Lin Yuan had an idea. If he were to find another good fey, as long as he could afford it, he wouldn\u2019t hesitate. Otherwise, the opportunity might just slip away in an instant.After experiencing this incident, Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t in the mood to continue shopping around the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s first floor.If he could complete this trade tomorrow, one of these four butterfly cocoons would contain the Vajra Butterfly. Thus, Chu Ci would also obtain her second fey. Everything would be decided tomorrow night.After sending Chu Ci back to the academy, Lin Yuan took a car and arrived at the Creation Master Association\u2019s vicinity. He then looked for a place to reside and prepared to participate in the Creation Master exam tomorrow morning.\u2026In the city lord residence, which wasn\u2019t far from the Creation Master Association, was a woman seated on the city lord residence\u2019s lord seat. She was wearing alizarin, crimson clothes.She spoke to three individuals who were standing before her.\u201cAdd twice as many men at the dimensional rifts around Redbud City\u2019s vicinity. Reinforcements must be provided within two months. Put tomorrow\u2019s matters aside and prepare a proposal to discuss with me at night.\u201dTwo of the men acknowledged and withdrew from the place, while an old man continued to stand there. \u201cLordess Ling Xiao, may I know your opinion on the seeded participants from this batch\u2019s spirit qi students?\u201d he asked.Ling Xiao took out a massive silk book. It was filled with rows of personal information, but almost all of them had been crossed out.The silk book had over 100 nominations of seeded participants, and there were only five that had been given a tick. There were also close to 30 that were given a question mark.\u201cI have already decided on 5 of the 20 Redbud Hundred\u2019s seeded participants. The remaining 34 will be kept for observation. Pay more attention to the student whose Elite fey has the Sacrifice ability. If the student has great potential, then add that student too.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 67": "Chapter 67: Class 1 ExamThe white-haired elder stood below and listened seriously to Ling Xiao\u2019s arrangements. However, he was obviously unclear with Ling Xiao\u2019s arrangement and asked, \u201cLordess Ling Xiao, according to the norm, the lower grade students are all put in reserve. Their potential would only be determined in the second year, according to their first year\u2019s performance. Why would you pay so much attention to a first-year student?\u201dThe white-haired elder was the Redbud Advanced Spirit Qi Academy\u2019s dean. The Redbud Intermediate Spirit Qi Academy was considered Redbud Advanced Spirit Qi Academy\u2019s sub-academy.Therefore, the elder had already vetted the name list before handing it over to Ling Xiao. The elder would provide ranking information every month.The names on the ranking would constantly be changing, and they would be evaluated with their growth for each month.Redbud City was a large-scale city in the Radiance Federation, and it was filled with resources. However, their nurturing toward the young generation wasn\u2019t as outstanding as Redbud City\u2019s economy. Redbud City was ranked top five among the 32 large-scale cities within the Radiance Federation in terms of economy.Presently, Redbud City only had three members within the Radiance Hundred. One of them had even dropped out of the Radiance Hundred Sequence two years ago due to some reason. This was why Ling Xiao paid extra attention to the younger generation\u2019s nurturing and development.Ling Xiao had given to the white-haired elder the heavy responsibility of collecting the information on every potential youth within Redbud City. Afterward, Ling Xiao would act as the filter to select 20 seeded participants for the Redbud Hundred. The remaining 80 members wouldn\u2019t be selected by Ling Xiao and would be decided through competition.The white-haired elder didn\u2019t understand her reasoning because this first-year student had just participated in live combat class and could only determine the student\u2019s innate talent. It was impossible to see the potential, but Lordess Ling Xiao picked the student, nonetheless.One\u2019s innate talent was natural, and it was indeed very important. However, the elder felt that the potential for hard work and diligence was also very important.\u201cJust do it according to my words.\u201d After speaking, Ling Xiao stopped talking and lowered her head. She was carefully looking at the name list in her hand and using a pen to write down the sequence for the students with question marks.The white-haired elder asked to be dismissed. When he left, he couldn\u2019t help but lament. Lordess Ling Xiao\u2019s personality was really getting increasingly overbearing, but since it was a task appointed by her, the elder would naturally do his best to complete it.The grand hall was in silence. Ling Xiao\u2019s alizarin, crimson clothes felt as though they dyed the grand hall with layers of bright colors.After a long time, Ling Xiao stood up and used her hand to stroke the spiritual ingredient ornament.\u201cThis year, the Redbud Hundred should have a higher chance of making it into the Radiance Hundred. The exclusive skill, Sacrifice, actually appeared again. However, all these things are considered trivial as compared to the event tomorrow. The young man who broke the record of getting full marks for the three knowledge spirit qi occupations, will he be able to pass and become a Class 2 Creation Master?\u201cThe Moon Empress actually said to report to her if the young man is able to pass the Class 2 Creation Master exam on the first try. Even if that young man, Lin Yuan, is a heavenly prodigy, if he isn\u2019t able to make it directly to become a Class 2 Creation Master, he won\u2019t stand a chance.\u201cHad it not been for Redbud City\u2019s previous calamity, things wouldn\u2019t be so difficult like now.\u201cEverything will be up to tomorrow.\u201d\u2026Lin Yuan woke up early the next day. He noticed that Genius was still sleeping soundly within his embrace. Lin Yuan then used his hand to gently stroke Genius\u2019 snow-white fur. It was soft to the touch, and he was reluctant to let go.Genius used its small head to rub against Lin Yuan\u2019s hand and gave off a lazy feeling.Lin Yuan smiled and scratched Genius\u2019 chin, which made Genius so comfortable that it started purring.While looking at Genius, Lin Yuan involuntarily recalled Chimey and wondered what it had been doing in the small store for the past day or so.Genius then let out a meow.Lin Yuan was worried about Chimey, but Genius wasn\u2019t. It didn\u2019t even know what time Chimey had slept yesterday night. Well, it might have constantly been streaming on the Star Web.When the sun was up in the sky, scattering warmth, the streets started to become busy.Lin Yuan immediately headed toward the Creation Master Association. When he arrived at the Creation Master Association, he could see Elder Ning standing at the entrance from afar.After taking a deep breath of the morning air, Elder Ning waved to Lin Yuan and said, \u201cCome on then. Follow me to the Class 1 exam. This old man will personally preside over your Class 1 Creation Master exam.\u201dLin Yuan quickly bowed in response. \u201cI shall trouble Elder Ning.\u201dElder Ning then patted on Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cLet\u2019s go. I have prepared a solitary breeding room for you today. You will conduct the exam in the breeding room.\u201dWhen a Creation Master was nurturing a fey, an extremely serene environment was required. Nurturing feys with the use of spiritual ingredients, was a very delicate job, and there must be no disturbance.Lin Yuan followed behind Elder Ning.The Class 1 Creation Master exam is very simple for me, but I have to carefully consider how to perform during the exam.How exactly should I perform?If I am able to complete the Class 1 Creation Master exam easily, will it really be beneficial to me?The wind would definitely destroy an outstanding tree in the forest. This was a problem that Lin Yuan would always have to face.In this world, Lin Yuan had to rely on himself for everything as he didn\u2019t have any foundation. Each of the steps he took would require careful consideration. If he took a wrong step, he wouldn\u2019t just be harming himself, but he would also implicate Chu Ci.Just as Lin Yuan was contemplating, Elder Ning turned around and spoke after seeing Lin Yuan\u2019s expression. \u201cThere is no need to be nervous. Didn\u2019t you say that all questions are difficult if you don\u2019t know them, but once you know them, they aren\u2019t difficult? If you are really able to make it to Class 2 like what you said yesterday, even this old man will be envious of you.\u201dAfter hearing Elder Ning\u2019s words, Lin Yuan ground his teeth.\u00a0I will go all out!Since I have already gotten full marks for the three knowledge spirit qi occupations\u2019 exams and broken the records, I shall also put in all my effort in the Creation Master exam and take this step forward. If Elder Ning is speaking like this, he surely wouldn\u2019t mean harm to me. I just don\u2019t know if it is worth it for Elder Ning to be envious of me.\u201cWhy does Elder Ning say so?\u201dElder Ning laughed heartily. \u201cKid, you are rather ambitious. If you wish to know of the benefit, you will need to ask after passing the Class 2 Creation Master exam.\u201dLin Yuan could see that Elder Ning was looking at him with eyes that were filled with expectations. Lin Yuan naturally wouldn\u2019t let Elder Ning down.It seemed like passing the Class 2 Creation Master exam directly would really have a great benefit.The Creation Master Association\u2019s reformation was naturally for a reason, and there was probably a very deep consideration for it.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t able to guess the details of the consideration, but he could guess that this reformation was to pick new Creation Masters that had potential.After walking into the breeding room, Lin Yuan saw an Elite fey that was locked up on the table. It was an Elite IX/Flawless fey.Lin Yuan then saw the exam topic on the table\u2014he had to evolve this Elite IX/Flawless Ironhead Stoat to bronze-grade.The Creation Master exam had a time restriction. If the participant couldn\u2019t evolve the Elite Ironhead Stoat to a Bronze one within eight hours, it would be considered a failure.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 68": "Chapter 68: Ling XiaoIf Lin Yuan wished to evolve this Ironhead Stoat, he would only require one hour to evolve it from the Elite IX/Flawless to bronze-grade. Even if he wanted to increase the quality to Epic before evolving to bronze-grade, he would only require around two hours.Lin Yuan looked at the spiritual ingredients on the table. Among them, there was the Sharp Pine Needle and the Heavy Iron Ore. Both spiritual ingredients were rather expensive.If these spiritual ingredients on the table were sold outside, they would at least be able to fetch 2 Radiance dollars.This was just a Class 1 Creation Master exam, and it was already enough to see the resources and cost required for higher class Creation Master exams. This was also enough to see that the Radiance Federation was putting in plenty of effort and resources to nurture Creation Masters.Once these resources were used up, they wouldn\u2019t be compensated. It was no wonder the Creation Master exams would only be conducted once a year.Lin Yuan picked up the spiritual ingredients on the table. Unlike other Creation Masters, he didn\u2019t use his own method to make a concoction with the spiritual ingredients. Instead, Lin Yuan fed the spiritual ingredients to the Elite Ironhead Stoat directly and started to transfer spirit qi into its body.Although feeding the spiritual ingredients to the Ironhead Stoat wouldn\u2019t cause it to evolve directly, it could help Lin Yuan to speed up the evolution process. It originally required one hour, but it was now shortened to 40 minutes.The Ironhead Stoat started to evolve with an intense reaction. After the evolution, the Ironhead Stoat was now a Bronze fey.As such, Lin Yuan had completed the Class 1 Creation Master exam and simply walked out of the breeding room. Since he had decided to showcase himself, he wasn\u2019t going to hold back. Only by exposing his talents would he be able to receive more attention.After exiting the breeding room, Lin Yuan noticed that there was another lady in an alizarin, crimson dress by the entrance along with Elder Ning. This lady looked to be no more than 28 years old, however, her aura showcased that she was someone important. A regular 28-year-old lady wouldn\u2019t possess such an aura. She was probably a powerful person.Elder Ning walked over and asked Lin Yuan with a frown, \u201cDid the concoction of spiritual ingredients fail? Why did you exit the breeding room so quickly?\u201dEven if Lin Yuan had failed, Elder Ning wouldn\u2019t blame Lin Yuan. On the contrary, he would still admire Lin Yuan for his knowledge exams\u2019 results.But now, Lin Yuan had already walked out of the breeding room after only 40 minutes, and in Elder Ning\u2019s opinion, Lin Yuan must have given up halfway through. Even if the spiritual ingredients\u2019 concoction had really failed, Lin Yuan should still have tried to see if the rest of the spiritual ingredients could produce an effect to help the fey complete its evolution.This was a kind of attitude.Ling Xiao looked at Lin Yuan and didn\u2019t say anything.When Lin Yuan exited, he wanted to tell Elder Ning that he had already completed the exam, but he didn\u2019t expect Elder Ning to feel that he had already failed.\u201cElder Ning, I have already succeeded. The concoction of the spiritual ingredients didn\u2019t fail. I have completed the exam.\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s words stunned Elder Ning. The latter immediately walked into the breeding room to check on Lin Yuan\u2019s result.At that moment, Lin Yuan noticed the silent lady walk over, and she said, \u201cYour participation in the three knowledge spirit qi occupations\u2019 exams yesterday was very exciting. Now it seems like your Creation Master\u2019s talent is also very promising.\u201dThe lady\u2019s method of speaking made Lin Yuan at a loss of how to reply for a moment. When this lady was speaking to him, Lin Yuan felt that she wasn\u2019t praising him, but she was standing from a certain angle to state the facts. The flow of conversation made Lin Yuan feel very strange. Her tone was filled with admiration but also felt very distant.At that moment, Elder Ning walked out of the breeding room, and when he saw the lady conversing with Lin Yuan, he introduced them. \u201cLin Yuan, this is our Redbud City Lordess. Lordess Ling Xiao.\u201dAfter introducing Ling Xiao, Elder Ning looked at Lin Yuan with a face that was overflowing with pleasant surprise and admiration.\u201cKid Yuan, well done! You have completed the Class 1 Creation Master exam within 40 minutes.\u201dLing Xiao didn\u2019t reply to Elder Ning\u2019s words immediately and bowed to Ling Xiao solemnly. \u201cGreetings to the City Lordess.\u201dLin Yuan finally understood why he would feel so strange when this lady was speaking to him. Redbud City was scorching and rainy, and it was always covered in dark clouds.City Lordess Ling Xiao was famous for her Fantasy Breed fey, the High Firmament Flower. Every time a hurricane that could create a flood would arrive, the High Firmament Flower would smash the rain clouds.It was also why Redbud City might be stuffy and humid, and there would be rain every few days, but there had never been a flood.It wasn\u2019t only the case. A very long time ago, a super-scaled dimensional rift had appeared within Redbud City\u2019s region, and in order to protect Redbud City, City Lordess Ling Xiao had been severely injured.She might have been healed in the end, but it affected her emotions, causing her to be in this state.Lin Yuan lived in Redbud City and was protected by Ling Xiao, so Lin Yuan felt respect for Ling Xiao from the bottom of his heart. Had she not tried to protect Redbud City, a king-class expert like Ling Xiao wouldn\u2019t have been severely injured.Ling Xiao shook her hand and patted on Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder. She might not have any emotions when speaking, nor did she have any change in expressions, but Lin Yuan felt as though he could feel that sudden joy.\u201cAre you going to participate in the Class 2 Creation Master exam immediately?\u201dLin Yuan nodded and heard Ling Xiao speaking again. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go through the Class 2 Creation Master exam tomorrow? You have just completed the Class 1 Creation Master exam today and should rest for a day. You will then be able to participate in the Class 2 Creation Master exam tomorrow at your best state and produce a more stable performance.\u201dLing Xiao didn\u2019t know why, but he could feel that Ling Xiao viewed his Class 2 Creation Master exam with great importance. It was the same for Elder Ning too.Lin Yuan replied, \u201cIt is fine for me to participate in the Class 2 Creation Master exam now. I didn\u2019t really use up much energy during the Class 1 Creation Master exam.\u201dLing Xiao looked toward Elder Ning and saw the latter nodding. Ling Xiao didn\u2019t say anything else.\u201cGreat, kid. You can just go into the same breeding room and conduct the Class 2 Creation Master exam. The Class 2 Creation Master exam isn\u2019t as simple as the Class 1 Creation Master exam. You don\u2019t just have to upgrade an Elite/Normal fey to the Epic quality. You still have to heal a Bronze fey with damaged roots,\u201d Elder Ning said to Lin Yuan.Elder Ning was obviously more worried about Lin Yuan\u2019s Class 2 Creation Master exam. Class 1 Creation Masters would normally need years of experience before they were qualified to participate in the Class 2 Creation Master exam. In addition, the passing rate was pitifully low.The Class 1 Creation Master exam was just to evolve a fey to the next grade, but the Class 2 Creation Master exam involved the fey\u2019s quality and roots.When one became a Class 2 Creation Master, they would be considered to have stepped into the true world of the Creation Masters.Each Class 2 Creation Master was the Radiance Federation\u2019s important capital.As for the current Lin Yuan, even if Elder Ning had great expectations, he still couldn\u2019t relax.In fact, when the Moon Empress proposed for the reformation, Elder Ning felt that the Moon Empress\u2019 standard for accepting a disciple was too harsh.Lin Yuan had already entered the breeding room and was preparing to go through the challenge for the Class 2 Creation Master exam.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 69": "Chapter 69: A Fey\u2019s GratitudeThe Class 1 Creation Master exam was just a doorstep. It was a filter to see if one had the qualifications to become a Creation Master, and it was considered the easiest exam. However, it was an exam that blocked out countless people.The Class 2 exam was much harder because becoming a Class 2 Creation Master would mean that one was an all-round Creation Master.It wasn\u2019t just to increase the fey\u2019s grade, but it was also to upgrade the quality of the fey and heal a severely injured fey\u2019s roots.Therefore, this obstacle wouldn\u2019t be so easy for a regular Class 1 Creation Master to surpass. Moreover, Lin Yuan was still so young.Ling Xiao still had that indifferent expression, but her hands were tightly clenched together.Lin Yuan entered the breeding room and picked up the exam topic. It stated that Lin Yuan had to evolve a fey, and it was an Elite/Flawless Jasmine Lily.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but lament his fate with Jasmine Lilies. The other fey made Lin Yuan\u2019s brows knit together, as it was actually a cyan crab that was the size of a small round table.The massive crab was lying there with its dying breath, and it felt as though it was experiencing extreme suffering. It was a Shear Pincers Crab.It was a Bronze fey that could fight in water, and its massive pincers could produce a burst of strength that could snap steel reinforced bars.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t see the injuries just from the appearance of the Shear Pincers Crab, however, it was supposed to be a very lively fey. It was currently lying there at its dying breath, and its mouth was bubbling with foam every now and then.Lin Yuan immediately understood that the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s injuries were extremely severe. As soon as Lin Yuan touched the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s shell, he knew what was wrong with it.When Lin Yuan touched the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s hard shell, it actually sank in a little when it was supposed to be hard like an armor. As soon as Lin Yuan pressed down, the Shear Pincers Crab would shiver with pain. Lin Yuan didn\u2019t dare to use any more strength as it was obvious that the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s shell was completely shattered. But due to the membrane on the back, the shattered shells were still connected.If the membrane wasn\u2019t around, the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s shell would have already broken into pieces. If the outside shell was already in such a state, it was obvious that the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s innards had suffered from the impact too.If such injuries persisted, in just a short moment, the Shear Pincers Crab would perish.Looking at the pained Shear Pincers Crab, Lin Yuan immediately reached out and touched the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s body. This time, he didn\u2019t immediately channel spirit qi to help recover the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s injuries. Instead, he used Morbius\u2019 exclusive skill, Pure Land of Bliss.In an instant, a sandy shore appeared under the Shear Pincers Crab, and it was just enough to accommodate the Shear Pincers Crab. The lustrous and jade-like sand emitted energy to heal the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s roots, allowing the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s injuries to heal in a short moment.The Shear Pincers Crab was trying to move its pincers with difficulty as though it was feeling its body recovering.When Lin Yuan activated the Pure Land of Bliss, he had also reached out to press on the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s body to channel spirit qi to heal its roots.In around two hours, Lin Yuan gradually healed the Shear Pincers Crab with Pure Land of Bliss\u2019 activation. He didn\u2019t enter the Spirit Lock spatial zone to heal the Shear Pincers Crab. The Spirit Lock spatial zone was Lin Yuan\u2019s trump card, and he would never expose it.This was Lin Yuan\u2019s first time using the Pure Land of Bliss. Previously, when Lin Yuan had healed a Bronze fey\u2019s roots, it had taken him four hours. With the help of Pure Land of Bliss, half the time was cut down.This meant that the Pure Land of Bliss\u2019 healing power was similar to his channeling of spirit qi to heal the fey\u2019s roots.Lin Yuan involuntarily lamented at the power of Pure Land of Bliss. The effects of Pure Land of Bliss was actually related to the spirit qi density in the surroundings. It also meant that if the fey was placed within the Spirit Lock spatial zone, the recovery time could be further shortened.Once Lin Yuan finished healing the Bronze Shear Pincers Crab, he prepared to upgrade the Jasmine Lily\u2019s quality. He suddenly noticed the Shear Pincers Crab snipping on the protruding part above its shell.It snipped off a huge protruding piece and handed it to Lin Yuan before blowing bubbles in a silly manner.Lin Yuan had obtained a Creation Master\u2019s capability for some time now, but this scene still gave him a shock that he had never experienced before.All living things had intelligence and knew how to be grateful.According to the knowledge that Lin Yuan had learned from Genius, Shear Pincers Crabs cherished their Crab Stone on the top of their shell almost obsessively.The Crab Stone was a kind of spiritual ingredient. It might not be expensive, but it was the most important possession to a fey like the Shear Pincers Crab. When harvesting the Crab Stone from the Shear Pincers Crab\u2019s shell, it would risk its life to protect it.The Shear Pincers Crab knew that Lin Yuan had rescued it and had personally removed the Crab Stone as a gift for Lin Yuan. This was a form of gratitude that transcended species, and it gave Lin Yuan an indescribable feeling. It was a throbbing sensation.The throbbing sensation contained an instinctive understanding toward all living things. Feys were just like humans and possessed feelings.After Lin Yuan received the Crab Stone from the Shear Pincers Crab, the latter then started to roam around the breeding room in a silly manner. It had now restored its originally lively personality.Lin Yuan stored the Crab Stone within the Spirit Lock spatial zone in a serious manner. He would keep this Crab Stone as a token of encouragement and responsibility as a Creation Master.Lin Yuan was already proficient in upgrading an Elite fey\u2019s quality to Epic. Thus, Lin Yuan completed the Jasmine Lily\u2019s upgrade without any problems.Now that Lin Yuan had already completed the Class 2 Creation Master exam, he looked at the spiritual ingredients that he had yet to use. He then took out a portion of the spiritual ingredients that he should use and stored them in the Spirit-Lock spatial zone.After bidding goodbye to the Shear Pincers Crab, Lin Yuan exited the breeding room again.Before Elder Ning could even ask, Ling Xiao asked as soon as she saw Lin Yuan exiting the room, \u201cHow is it?\u201dLin Yuan revealed a sunshine boy\u2019s unique smile and said, \u201cThe Shear Pincers Crab is healed, and the Jasmine Lily\u2019s quality has become Epic.\u201dAfter hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s response, Ling Xiao\u2019s clenched fists were finally relaxed before she said three consecutive \u2018great\u2019 while looking at Lin Yuan with admiration.Elder Ning quickly entered the breeding room to check. After verifying that Lin Yuan had completed the exam, he laughed heartily and walked out.\u201cHeroes are really born from the young generations. You took just three and a half hours to complete the Class 2 Creation Master exam and even completed it with such outstanding results. You are the most talented Creation Master this old man has seen in so many years. Later on, this old man will personally register your proof as a Class 2 Creation Master and issue you with the crest of a Class 2 Creation Master, and also the special privileges that Creation Masters can enjoy.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 70": "Chapter 70: Class 2 Creation MasterLin Yuan\u2019s heart was finally at ease after he finished the Class 2 Creation Master exam. This was a plan that Lin Yuan had decided early on, and now that he had accomplished it, he was able to relax.\u201cAfter passing the Creation Master exam in Redbud City, the Creation Masters will obtain a merchant store. Later on, I will ask someone to send the merchant store\u2019s information to your Star Web account. It will be easier for you to make a choice on the Star Web store.\u201dLing Xiao left the Creation Master Association after informing Lin Yuan. Ling Xiao\u2019s footsteps were very light as she walked, and it was easy to see that she was delighted.Previously, if Ling Xiao encountered a Class 2 Creation Master who had just completed the exam, she would definitely try to recruit and make the Class 2 Creation Master stay within Redbud City. A Class 2 Creation Master could greatly develop no matter which major city they chose. They could even have a good store in the royal capital.All the major cities were also competing, be it the qualifications for the Radiance Hundred or the resources for the Creation Masters. These were all crucial factors to compete over.As for Ling Xiao, she would definitely prepare a good store. However, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t feel the need to recruit Lin Yuan. After all, Lin Yuan had already fulfilled the Moon Empress\u2019 criterion, and she would report Lin Yuan\u2019s information to the Moon Empress.The Moon Empress will make her arrangements and will also take care of Redbud City\u2019s matters. This will be enough.Lin Yuan scratched his head. He already knew that the Creation Masters had great benefits, but he didn\u2019t think that the Redbud City would actually reward Class 2 Creation Masters with a store. The Redbud City was a major city in the Radiance Federation, and it wouldn\u2019t be exaggerating to say that every inch of land was considered gold.Possessing a store in Redbud City was something that Lin Yuan would never dare to think about in the past. But now, even if Lin Yuan obtained a store in Redbud City, he wasn\u2019t going to leave the Xia Region. After all, establishing a store in Redbud City wasn\u2019t within Lin Yuan\u2019s current plan.Lin Yuan\u2019s current plan was still to snowball and accumulate resources, as well as increase the grade of his feys and his spirit qi occupation rank. He wanted to reach the top 100 floors of the Star Tower and progress to the Celestial Stairway.After Lin Yuan completed the registration with Elder Ning and obtained the Creation Master Association\u2019s authentication, he was now approved as a Class 2 Creation Master. In addition, it was bound to his Star Web account.From now on, Lin Yuan would be an approved Class 2 Creation Master.A pair of aged hands held onto a crest that was decorated with life symbols and two stars. The hands then solemnly pinned the crest on Lin Yuan\u2019s chest.\u201cLin Yuan, from now on, you are a Class 2 Creation Master that is officially recognized by the Radiance Federation\u2019s Creation Master Association. Do your best on the path of a Creation Master.\u201dElder Ning\u2019s \u2018do your best\u2019 made a huge impact, and it felt as though they had a magical power that struck Lin Yuan\u2019s heart after passing through his ears. It felt like a kind of inheritance. It was a recognition and encouragement from a senior to a junior.Lin Yuan nodded in a serious manner. \u201cElder Ning, I will continue to work hard and will not be complacent at all times.\u201dIn the beginning, becoming a Creation Master was Lin Yuan\u2019s method to continue surviving. However, the Creation Master occupation was now something that Lin Yuan enjoyed. Be it the ability to feel the transformation of life or the process of saving a life, they were all things that Lin Yuan felt proud of.Elder Ning laughed heartily while his eyes were filled with benevolence. \u201cYou have also done something good today.\u201dLin Yuan couldn\u2019t really understand what Elder Ning meant. \u201cWhat good?\u201d\u201cNaturally, something good! This Bronze Shear Pincers Crab is a contracted fey with an owner. Since you healed this Shear Pincers Crab, you have also rescued the life of a spirit qi professional. Is this not considered a good thing?\u201dLin Yuan didn\u2019t expect that the injured Shear Pincers Crab was actually a contracted fey with an owner.Elder Ning explained, \u201cWhen spirit qi professionals are training in the outside world if they encounter sudden danger, the fey might suffer injuries to their roots. Most of these spirit qi professionals don\u2019t have the capability to heal their feys\u2019 injured roots. During the Creation Master Association\u2019s Creation Master exams, these people are given a chance. If the Creation Master passes the exam, they will naturally save a person. If they don\u2019t pass, it will be a risk that the spirit qi professionals have to bear.\u201cThis is a proposal that was agreed upon by the three top masters. After the three top masters made the exam topic, the Creation Master Association would spend huge resources every year to conduct the exam. However, this old man thinks that it is very worth it.\u201dAfter listening to Elder Ning\u2019s explanation, Lin Yuan understood what was going on when Elder Ning said he had done something good. Today, he had passed the exam and also rescued a stranger, giving it twice the meaning.The Creation Master Association\u2019s actions showed a warm side of this world. This warmth came from the Radiance Federation, and it was the place where Lin Yuan lived. The warmth was constantly strengthening Lin Yuan\u2019s sense of belonging.Elder Ning helped Lin Yuan to carefully wear his Class 2 Creation Master crest and said, \u201cYou can just wear this Class 2 Creation Master crest during normal times. It can also be used as a decoration when entering the Star Web. Wearing this crest will bring you plenty of conveniences. Also, this is another Star Web Card. Take it.\u201dThis particular Star Web Card was something that Lin Yuan always wanted. When one\u2019s status reached a certain level in the Radiance Federation, they would be able to obtain a second Star Web Card.The Radiance Federation approved this Star Web Card, and it was the same as giving a person two identities in the Star Web. Creation Masters could use this Star Web Card as their second identity, providing them a kind of protection.Lin Yuan planned to split his identity as a Creation Master and his identity in the Star Tower. He was going to use his identity as a Creation Master to build the Star Web store, while his other identity would challenge the Star Tower.Lin Yuan received the Star Web Card from Elder Ning, stored it, and was just about to bid farewell. However, Elder Ning stopped him.\u201cWhy are you in such a hurry? Take this as well.\u201dElder Ning handed him a small box. When he opened the box, two crests that were engraved with two stars and a shield appeared.\u201cThese are retainer crests for Class 2 Creation Masters. Class 2 Creation Masters are able to accept two spirit qi professionals as their retainers, and they serve as vassals. However, the Creation Master needs to help nurture the retainers\u2019 feys. These two crests represent that the Radiance Federation can recognize that you have two retainers. For retainers that violate the retainer responsibilities, you can propose for arbitration to the Radiance Federation. But when choosing a retainer, you must carefully inspect their character.\u201dElder Ning gestured upon seeing Lin Yuan store the box. \u201cKid, you can go now. When you are free, come over to Redbud City to visit this old man. If there is anything else, Ling Xiao and I will contact you.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan stepped out of the Creation Master Association\u2019s entrance, it was already dark. Different from when he arrived, he was now a genuine Class 2 Creation Master!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 71": "Chapter 71: Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s CommotionIf there was a difference before and after becoming a Class 2 Creation Master, Lin Yuan felt that it was the peace of mind.Lin Yuan had already made plenty of plans for himself, but he would need to obtain the qualifications of a Class 2 Creation Master first for these plans to work. He had already achieved the first step.Having the confidence to obtain it was just an unrealistic rosy view before actually obtaining it.Once the unrealistic goal turned into a reality that was pinned on his chest, it had indeed given Lin Yuan much more confidence. Being a Class 2 Creation Master was already enough for him to guarantee a safe life in this world. As for the benefit that Elder Ning and the City Lordess Ling Xiao mentioned, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t really put too much thought into it.Presently, Lin Yuan had to go to the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s first floor and conduct the trade with the masked man he had encountered yesterday.Lin Yuan might be a Class 2 Creation Master now, but if he lost the Blue Flash Butterfly trade, it would probably be impossible to find another one.Beautiful and rare feys might not be used for forming contracts. Some of these beautiful feys were kept as pets and as decorations. Their unique beauty had given these feys a value that couldn\u2019t be measured with money.No matter which world humans were in, and no matter how many billions of years they had been evolving, their desire for beautiful things had never changed.Lin Yuan needed this Blue Flash Butterfly, not for its beauty, but for its basic ability. It was for him to increase his strength, and it had great compatibility with Morbius\u2019 Spirit Lock. Therefore, Lin Yuan had to obtain it.While having such thoughts, Lin Yuan arrived at the Rare Lifeform Pavilion. As soon as Lin Yuan swiped his Star Web Card, an attendant immediately rushed to welcome him with a bow.\u201cEsteemed Class 2 Creation Master, welcome to the Rare Lifeform Pavilion. I wonder which floor are you going to visit? If you need any specific fey, you can go to the third floor\u2019s tea room to have a cup of spirit tea. Allow me to help you find the fey that you are interested in.\u201dThe appearance of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion staff member startled Lin Yuan. He was now a Class 2 Creation Master, and he wasn\u2019t just limited to the first floor of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion. He was able to roam throughout all four floors of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion without any obstruction.\u201cThank you, but I don\u2019t need any help. I will just shop around casually on the first floor. Please continue with your own work.\u201d After replying, Lin Yuan smiled and nodded before heading into the Rare Lifeform Pavilion.The attendant had been working for two years in the Rare Lifeform Pavilion, yet she was standing still with a stunned expression. Her young lady face was dyed with a rosy tint.She didn\u2019t expect this handsome young man to be a Class 2 Creation Master, as well as so friendly when treating others. A person\u2019s status didn\u2019t matter. If they had the upbringing of being polite, it would always give others a good impression.Once Lin Yuan entered the first floor of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion, he noticed that there were one or a few \u2018eyes of a hurricane\u2019. The customers of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion were all subtly attracted toward a direction. It was either the appearance of some great fey or a commotion.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t really interested, but as he walked toward the direction of the masked man\u2019s counter, he noticed that the \u2018eye of the hurricane\u2019 was in the direction of that masked man\u2019s counter too.Lin Yuan walked a little closer and noticed it was really as he expected. There were plenty of people gathered in front of the masked man\u2019s counter, more than yesterday night.The masked man was standing there and had placed his hands on the counter without saying anything. At that moment, Lin Yuan heard a rather arrogant voice. \u201cYou said you are able to prove that you caught these four butterfly cocoons in the wild. Thus, I am willing to buy two to try my luck. Now that I am able to pay the price you offered, why do you still want to wait for the customer you met yesterday? Did you sign an agreement, or did you receive a deposit?\u201dThe voice originated from a middle-aged man, who had black hair that was mixed with white strands. But it wasn\u2019t really accurate to judge that he was middle-aged just because of his hair color. One could maintain their hair color with good care treatments to slow down the white hair growth. The skin could also maintain its young luster through care treatments. However, the wrinkles and those age spots showed that this man was considered an old man who maintained his youth rather well.The masked man looked at the time on his mobile phone and said, \u201cIt is 19:00 now. I have arranged the time to meet him at 20:00. If he doesn\u2019t arrive by 21:00, I will choose to sell these cocoons.\u201dBefore the arrogant middle-aged man spoke, a young man beside him spoke with dissatisfaction. \u201cHow can my lord wait two hours for you? You are selling goods, but you aren\u2019t accepting the deal when we are willing to pay. Aren\u2019t you looking down on my lord?!\u201dWhile speaking, the young man puffed up his chest and patted on the crest on his right chest.Lin Yuan looked over and saw one star and a shield on the crest. It was the crest of a Class 1 Creation Master\u2019s retainer.Class 1 Creation Masters could also have a retainer. Evidently, this young man was the middle-aged man\u2019s knight retainer, while that middle-aged man was a Class 1 Creation Master.The young man was now rather anxious. His master was a gambler, and whenever his master saw a wild butterfly cocoon, he would have the urge to buy one. If his master was rejected, it would cause his master to be unhappy, and the young man would be the one to receive the blame.Although a Creation Master\u2019s retainer might be able to receive help from the Creation Master, and the retainer crest allowed them to act with higher authority, the retainers were still vassals. Due to his master\u2019s status, there were things that his master couldn\u2019t say, so he had to stand at the front as a retainer.The young man took a silent glance and received an eye signal from his master. The young man immediately stood up with a ramrod-straight back.The surrounding people had placed their thoughts on this commotion and didn\u2019t observe carefully. As such, they didn\u2019t expect to see an esteemed Creation Master on the first floor.Most of the people on the first floor of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion were ordinary people, and it was naturally very hard for them to make any contact with low-ranked spirit qi professionals, let alone Creation Masters.Currently, most of the onlookers\u2019 eyes were filled with curiosity and reverence. However, they were plenty of people whose eyes contained dissatisfaction.It was due to the retainer\u2019s words that were obviously trying to use his status to put on pressure. One might not be able to feel anything if such things didn\u2019t happen to them, but those with righteousness found it hard to enjoy.The masked man walked to the corner and sat on the ground without saying anything else.When the retainer saw that the masked man was unwilling to comply, he was about to reprimand him, but an indifferent voice echoed from behind. \u201cThose who are out to make trades can choose to sell, but they can naturally choose not to sell too. Selling feys isn\u2019t like a regular trade of merchandise. There is a need to suit the intentions of both parties. Don\u2019t you understand such a simple reasoning?\u201dLin Yuan saw that the retainer was going to continue making things difficult for the masked man, so he quickly commented.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 72": "Chapter 72: A Near-Death Source-Type LifeformLin Yuan wasn\u2019t really helping the masked man out of a difficult situation. The masked man was in this situation mainly because of their verbal appointment yesterday night.When a gentleman gave his words, he must keep to it.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect the masked man to keep to the deal after yesterday night\u2019s verbal appointment and rushed departure. It would be false if Lin Yuan said he wasn\u2019t moved. If this masked man didn\u2019t keep to his words and keep to his promise, Lin Yuan\u2019s Blue Flash Butterfly would have flown away.The retainer could only speak in a harsh tone, as the Rare Lifeform Pavilion wasn\u2019t like the outside. The retainer understood that this place wasn\u2019t his master\u2019s store where his words held authority. Even when a C-rank spirit qi professional visited, they would need to be polite to him. If a B-rank spirit qi professional sought help from his master, they would also need to treat him with respect.The Rare Lifeform Pavilion was a place where his words weren\u2019t useful at all. In fact, if he caused trouble in the Rare Lifeform Pavilion, he would need to bear responsibility for any losses. If the Rare Lifeform Pavilion came after him, even his master wouldn\u2019t bother about him. Even if his master wanted to help, what could his master do? It might not be useful.The Rare Lifeform Pavilion wasn\u2019t backed by some private organization\u2014the Radiance Federation supported it.When the retainer heard that someone was trying to meddle in his business, his pent up anger finally found an exit. \u201cWhat Tom, Dick, or Harry are you to meddle in my business\u2014\u201dWhile speaking, the young retainer turned around, but before he could finish, his words were all stuffed back into his mouth.As a person who was extremely mindful of his status as a Class 1 Creation Master\u2019s retainer, he always hoped that others could see the crest on his right chest. Therefore, he would also subconsciously notice others\u2019 right chest too.If he didn\u2019t look, it wouldn\u2019t matter, but he got a shock once he saw it.This 17- or 18-year-old youth actually wore a crest that was almost similar to his master\u2019s crest, but it didn\u2019t have one star. It had two stars.He is actually a Class 2 Creation Master!In the young retainer\u2019s memory, when he was following his master, he was fortunate enough to see a few Class 2 Creation Masters, but they were all old men. A young Creation Master like Lin Yuan, a Class 2 one at that, had immediately broken the young retainer\u2019s knowledge.Upon recalling his master\u2019s respectful behavior toward those Class 2 Creation Masters and recalling how he said Lin Yuan was a Tom, Dick, or Harry, the young retainer was petrified. He felt his tongue turning numb, and he couldn\u2019t even utter half a word.The young retainer\u2019s reaction was too dramatic. Previously, he had been behaving all high and mighty, but he suddenly turned timid and cowardly. This transformation immediately made everyone\u2019s attention shift to Lin Yuan.Right now, Lin Yuan had turned into the eye of the hurricane for the first floor of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion.When everyone focused their attention, they quickly noticed that Lin Yuan was wearing a Class 2 Creation Master\u2019s crest on his chest. They couldn\u2019t help but exclaim, \u201cHe is actually a Class 2 Creation Master!\u201d\u201cThis is my first time seeing a Class 2 Creation Master!\u201d\u201cHow can a Class 2 Creation Master be so young?!\u201dMost of the people here were ordinary people. They might know that Creation Masters had noble status, but a Creation Master\u2019s life was still too remote for them.Therefore, Class 2 Creation Masters would only be a term of respect for ordinary people. But to a Class 1 Creation Master, they viewed Class 2 Creation Master with a different outlook.Becoming a Class 2 Creation Master was what they aimed for, and it was also a huge mountain pressing down from above. When the middle-aged man saw that Lin Yuan was such a young Class 2 Creation Master, his previously prideful attitude had been withdrawn. His overbearing attitude was now cautious and humble.He immediately smiled and said, \u201cI didn\u2019t think I would be able to see the esteemed sir here! It is truly an honor!\u201dThe Class 1 Creation Master didn\u2019t know Lin Yuan at all, but seeing how young Lin Yuan was, the middle-aged man looked at Lin Yuan with an additional layer of reverence.Creation Masters could receive an inheritance, and a mentored Creation Master would advance at a much faster speed. At the same time, the Creation Master occupation was one that used up an extreme amount of resources. Each advancement would require a massive accumulation of spiritual ingredients.Creation Masters relied on senses, and there was also a need to increase the technique. The price for Creation Masters to evolve a fey was so high because of the massive amount of resources required by the Creation Masters.This was also why poor families couldn\u2019t produce nobles.In the Class 1 Creation Master\u2019s opinion, Lin Yuan was a person with authority and wealth. His age and achievement stated everything. However, the Class 1 Creation Master didn\u2019t know that Lin Yuan was actually an anomaly. His Creation Master standard was entirely achieved by himself.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t interested in the Class 1 Creation Master\u2019s greetings at all. Therefore, he ignored the middle-aged man and walked straight for the masked man. \u201cI am here to trade, and I thank you for keeping your promise.\u201dThe Class 1 Creation Master didn\u2019t mind Lin Yuan\u2019s indifference at all. Instead, he let out a relieved smile because Lin Yuan\u2019s indifference meant that Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t pursue the matter.He didn\u2019t expect that this masked man\u2019s promise was made with a Class 2 Creation Master. The Class 1 Creation Master looked at the masked man and felt his teeth getting achy.Couldn\u2019t you just tell me that you made a promise with a Class 2 Creation Master!? The way you stayed silent and not saying anything is the same as you trying to frame me!However, the Class 1 Creation Master didn\u2019t know that the masked man was looking at Lin Yuan\u2019s in a clueless manner, as the masked man didn\u2019t know that his promise was made toward a Class 2 Creation Master.The masked man stood up and said, \u201cI will provide you the proof that these four butterfly cocoons were found in the Endless Forest, and you will pay in full.\u201d The masked man\u2019s words didn\u2019t sound like a question and were more like a statement.Lin Yuan nodded and said, \u201cOkay!\u201dLin Yuan was able to use his ability, True Data, to check on the butterfly-species fey inside the cocoon, so he didn\u2019t need proof from the masked man. However, he didn\u2019t stop the masked man.The masked man had been treated as a swindler yesterday, and some people were specially here to watch the show. As such, when this masked man showed the proof, it would also prove to everyone else. The masked man activated his spiritual energy, but he took a very long time until his body was shivering, only to summon a purple insect cocoon.The insect cocoon was huge, and it wasn\u2019t the same as the butterfly cocoons. It had a flesh-like cocoon wall and looked rather tough. It was just like a small heart that was breeding a life within.At that moment, Lin Yuan used True Data to check on the insect cocoon. When he read the information of the insect cocoon, his pupils contracted. This insect cocoon wasn\u2019t a normal fey but actually a source-type lifeform. However, this source-type lifeform was in a near-death state!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 73": "Chapter 73: Insect QueenSource-type lifeforms could be said to the most amazing and rare things. Each of the source-type lifeforms had different unique traits.Lin Yuan\u2019s Source Seed didn\u2019t require any spiritual energy and used fresh blood to form the contract. It could also evolve according to the contractor\u2019s will, and it was different from the other Source Seeds that were recorded.Lin Yuan had allowed Genius to specifically learn information on Source Seeds.Upon seeing how the masked man used his spiritual energy to summon the purple flesh cocoon, Lin Yuan had a subtle conjecture that this source-type lifeform was an Insect Queen.An Insect Queen was like a breeding machine and could use the insects that she devoured in each grade to use as models. It could then produce and replicate insects of the same model and gene.One could say that an Insect Queen was equivalent to an insect swarm. However, an Insect Queen required an insane amount of spiritual energy from the host. After forming a contract with an Insect Queen, the spirit qi professional wouldn\u2019t be able to form contracts with other feys.This was the difference between the Source Seed, Red Thorn, and this source-type Insect Queen.Presently, this Insect Queen was in a near-death state, and its roots must have received a severe injury. The Insect Queen didn\u2019t have a choice but to maintain its life through a cocoon form.Source-type lifeforms always had a flaw, and after so many years, the Radiance Federation could still not resolve this problem. When source-type lifeforms were severely injured, they could be maintained by using large amounts of spiritual ingredients. However, once a source-type lifeform was in a near-death state, it couldn\u2019t recover like other feys by using spiritual ingredients.The source-type lifeform was a lifeform that had a hard time getting injured. It also meant that the roots of the source-type lifeform were extremely hard to damage. Since the source-type lifeform was in a near-death state, it had regressed to its initial state. This was already the lowest form for the source-type lifeform to maintain its life.At that moment, the source-type lifeform could only receive the purest spirit qi, and only a massive amount of pure spirit qi could allow it to recover. This was rather similar to the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish.However, the spirit qi\u2019s purity required by the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish was far below the near-death source-type lifeform. Spirit qi with high purity could be extracted with the right concoction of spirit ingredients.However, highly concentrated spirit qi that was extracted from spiritual ingredients had a certain level of medicinal effects. Even if the medicinal effects were mild, it was still fatal for a source-type Insect Queen in the near-death state.Lin Yuan finally understood why this masked man would be in such a depressed state. Lin Yuan understood the depression and could actually feel it himself.The depression originated from the injury of the Insect Queen. The requirement of spiritual energy from the Insect Queen didn\u2019t allow the masked man to form contracts with other feys. This was the same as severing the masked man\u2019s path as a spirit qi professional.Everyone present, even the Class 1 Creation Master, didn\u2019t recognize what kind of fey the masked man\u2019s purple flesh cocoon was.The world had massive amounts of information, and if Lin Yuan hadn\u2019t used True Data and hadn\u2019t allowed Genius to study information related to Source Seeds, Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t have been able to recognize it.The masked man looked at the purple flesh cocoon on his hand for a long time before saying to Lin Yuan, \u201cPlace your hand on the insect cocoon, and you will be able to see the scene of me finding the four butterfly cocoons in the depths of the Endless Forest.\u201dIf there were categories among the source-type lifeforms, the Insect Queen was considered a production-type and spiritual-type. The Insect Queen\u2019s spiritual-type trait was to allow for the viewing of memories.The masked man didn\u2019t mind others\u2019 opinions, and it was fine as long as he could prove the origin of the four butterfly cocoons. As for the doubts of others, the masked man didn\u2019t care at all.Lin Yuan took two steps forward and placed his hand on the purple flesh cocoon, and he could feel a mild warmth from the flesh cocoon. The lifeform within the flesh cocoon was already extremely frail and weak. It felt as though a small flame that could be extinguished from a breeze.If this was a regular commotion, when the others saw this method of proof, they would think if this was actually a show. However, with Lin Yuan\u2019s status as a Class 2 Creation Master, no one had such thoughts.Four butterfly cocoons for 120 Radiance dollars might be an astronomical price, but it was just a small matter to a Class 2 Creation Master. Therefore, it wasn\u2019t worth it for a Class 2 Creation Master to act such a show.Seeing that there wasn\u2019t any more show to watch, the crowd scattered.When the middle-aged Class 1 Creation Master saw that his young retainer was still in a state of shock, he was so enraged that he slapped at the neck of the young retainer, waking the retainer up immediately.The young retainer shrunk his neck after seeing his master\u2019s enraged expression. He then followed the middle-aged Creation Master to exit the Rare Lifeform Pavilion in a dejected manner.If it was any other time, the middle-aged Class 1 Creation Master would definitely stay behind to see if he could build a good relationship with Lin Yuan, a young Class 2 Creation Master. It would be the same as paving an additional path for himself.But after recalling how his retainer had spoken out of his turn earlier, the Class 1 Creation Master was afraid that Lin Yuan might take revenge later on. Hence, he didn\u2019t dare to continue staying here and left this place of commotion.The \u2018eye of the hurricane\u2019 had now calmed down, and the Rare Lifeform Pavilion was restored back to normal.Lin Yuan placed his hand on the purple flesh cocoon and felt the spiritual waves from within the flesh cocoon. His mind formed with a scene of how the masked man collected the four butterfly cocoons.The masked man had indeed found these four cocoons within the Endless Forest.Just as Lin Yuan was sensing the scene within his mind, he felt the purple flesh cocoon emitting a painful struggle from within. Lin Yuan was able to sense the pain from the insect cocoon\u2019s spiritual world.However, the struggle of pain was also pitifully weak. This intense spiritual wave felt like it was the final spurt of energy before death.The masked man\u2019s expression suddenly became nervous. He could obviously feel the pain of this Insect Queen, and his palm was shaking.Since Lin Yuan felt the Insect Queen\u2019s pain, he quickly circulated his spiritual power and poured in extremely pure spirit qi into the Insect Queen\u2019s body. If the Insect Queen\u2019s pain was like boiling water that was about to burst out from the edges, then Lin Yuan\u2019s spirit qi was like clean, warm water. When the clean, warm water was added to the boiling water, it might not be able to stop the boiling state immediately like cold water, but it used the most gentle method to restore peace for the Insect Queen.As expected, when Lin Yuan\u2019s pure spirit qi entered the Insect Queen\u2019s body, it awakened the Insect Queen and its source-type recovery capability.A few short minutes might not be able to heal the Insect Queen\u2019s injuries, but it was enough to bring the Insect Queen from the dying state back to the near-death state.Lin Yuan withdrew his hand, and when he lifted his head, he saw the masked man looking at him with fixed eyes.Different from before, the masked man\u2019s eyes weren\u2019t filled with depression. It looked like there was a rainbow that suddenly appeared within the darkness that lasted for several years. The light in the eyes was hope that broke out and also indescribably joy.There was some hesitation, too, as he looked at Lin Yuan and wanted to say something but didn\u2019t know what to say.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe masked man hesitated for a long time before his eyes gradually became determined. \u201cThat, I don\u2019t know if I can\u2026\u201dThe masked man spoke in a stuttering manner, but Lin Yuan could already guess what the masked man wanted to say.Lin Yuan took the initiative and said, \u201cFollow me to the tea room upstairs before we have a good talk.\u201dThe Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s tea room on the third floor was actually a private room with a graceful and comfortable environment. It had been specially built with sound isolation, so the people inside wouldn\u2019t need to worry that others might overhear their discussion in the tea room or be disturbed.The masked man quickly replied, \u201cOkay!\u201dAfter speaking, he was preparing to follow Lin Yuan. Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect this masked man, who was always calm and steady, to actually become flustered.Lin Yuan pointed at the four butterfly cocoons on the counter and said, \u201cLet us complete the trade for these four butterfly cocoons first.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan was collecting the four butterfly cocoons, he looked at one of the white and ordinary cocoons with excited feelings. Lin Yuan placed the Blue Flash Butterfly\u2019s cocoon in a box by itself. The Vajra Butterfly that was reserved for Chu Ci had also been put aside specially. As for the two other cocoons, one was a Poison Powder Butterfly, while the larger white cocoon was a Hunter Butterfly.The Vajra Butterfly was the fey with the most evolution variations among the butterfly feys. It might not be especially rare among the butterfly feys, but the price wasn\u2019t low either. An Elite Vajra Butterfly would cost around 40 Radiance dollars.The Poison Powder Butterfly and the Hunter Butterfly were both less than 10 Radiance dollars.Therefore, without the Blue Flash Butterfly, Lin Yuan\u2019s purchase of these four butterfly cocoons would be making a loss. However, since he obtained the Blue Flash Butterfly, it would be considered a pure gain.After the trade, Lin Yuan was about to transfer the money to the masked man\u2019s Star Web account, but the masked man wouldn\u2019t accept it.Lin Yuan patted on the masked man\u2019s shoulder and said, \u201cThis matter is this matter. Since I purchased your butterfly cocoons, I naturally have to pay you the Radiance dollars. If you have something to say, we can talk in the tea room.\u201dAfter hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s statement, the masked man finally agreed.Lin Yuan looked for the staff and proposed to use one of the tea rooms, so they were directly led to the third floor.The tea room environment was truly great, and there were several pots of Silver flowers and plants that were blooming brightly, allowing the room to be filled with a graceful fragrance.After sitting on the tea room sofa and sipping on the spirit tea made with feys, one would involuntarily feel that their fatigue was all washed clean by the tea fragrance.Obviously, the masked man didn\u2019t have the thoughts to bother about the spirit tea that he would rarely see.Lin Yuan opened his mouth and said, \u201cWhat is on your mind? You can just tell me directly.\u201dLin Yuan didn\u2019t immediately expose the masked man\u2019s thoughts. These were things that Lin Yuan hoped for the masked man to speak personally, and it would serve as a method to overcome his past.The masked man looked at Lin Yuan for a long time before he reached out and took off his mask. The face behind the mask wasn\u2019t as old as a middle-aged man that Lin Yuan imagined. The man looked to be around 25 or 26 years old, but his eyes had an aged feeling that didn\u2019t suit his face.After taking off the mask, the man circulated his spiritual energy. A deep purple rune appeared and revolved around the man. The man then started to circulate his spiritual power too.There might not be a whirlpool formed, but there was already a current.Lin Yuan raised his brows and didn\u2019t expect this masked man to have a Willpower Rune. From the looks of it, his spirit qi rank was at the A-rank. If he progressed further and obtained a fantasy breed fey, he could be considered a king-class expert.Given this man\u2019s age and talent, it was impossible for him to be ordinary. Such talent would be considered top-notch within the Radiance Federation, and not to mention he possessed a source-type lifeform, the Insect Queen.If the Insect Queen wasn\u2019t severely injured and reached a near-death state, this man should be an expert among the young generation\u2019s top ranks.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t ask, and it was the masked man who spoke first this time. \u201cLet me introduce myself. My name is Liu Jie, 27 years old. Previously, I was a B-rank combat-class spirit qi professional. I possess the Insect Queen, a Platinum III/Epic lifeform.\u201dLiu Jie introduced himself in a serious manner while Lin Yuan listened seriously too. After giving an introduction on his personal information, Liu Jie supplemented. \u201cTwo years ago, I was also part of the Radiance Hundred, Sequence #39, Heart of Insect Swarm.\u201d1After hearing this statement, Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes widened open, and his pupils contracted.\u00a0Sequence #39, Heart of Insect Swarm?Even though Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t really passionate about news, he had still heard of news on Sequence #39, the Heart of Insect Swarm.During a Class 3 dimensional rift that had opened up in the nearby Cold Frost City, the dimensional rift had been connected to a Dark Subterranean World. The subterranean world\u2019s lifeforms were famous for being greedy and ruthless. They would hunt and kill all living lifeforms.The Class 3 dimensional rift hadn\u2019t brought much damage to Cold Frost City because of Sequence #39, Heart of Insect Swarm, commanding the insect swarm. He alone had stalled the Class 3 dimensional rift\u2019s subterranean beasts for half an hour. It had been this half an hour that had prevented the Cold Frost City from turning into a purgatory.However, Sequence #39, Heart of Insect Swarm, had vanished afterward, never to appear again.Two years weren\u2019t enough to wipe out everything. However, as compared to the other Radiance Hundred, the Heart of Insect Swarm wasn\u2019t as famous as before.One year ago, the Radiance Hundred had been sorting their Sequence again, and because the Heart of Insect Swarm hadn\u2019t appeared, he had been removed from the Radiance Hundred. It was truly a pity.However, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect that a person who had become a Radiance Hundred and Sequence #39 would be wearing a mask and bringing his injured source-type lifeform around. He had actually been seeking survival by searching and selling butterfly cocoons on the Rare Lifeform Pavilion\u2019s first floor.This made Lin Yuan feel an indescribable pressure.Perhaps Liu Jie was able to see the change in Lin Yuan\u2019s expression, so he continued to explain, \u201cAfter that battle, the Insect Queen and I weren\u2019t supposed to survive. It was the Bamboo Monarch who used three months to heal me. At the same time, he was able to maintain the Insect Queen at a barely near-death state. I am the one that chose my current lifestyle. I didn\u2019t wish to become someone useless who lived in my glorious past.\u201dLin Yuan could feel Liu Jie\u2019s pride in his words. Lin Yuan might not be able to understand Liu Jie fully, but he was still filled with admiration.Perhaps, this was the life of contribution that was chosen by a heroic person.At that moment, Liu Jie heard Liu Jie speaking again. \u201cBut today, you allowed me to see hope again. It is unknown why your spirit qi is able to recover my Insect Queen\u2019s injuries.\u201dWhile speaking, Liu Jie knelt on one knee and made a retainer\u2019s posture swearing the oath.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75: The First Retainer KnightA determined voice echoed. \u201cI use the Willpower Rune as an oath to become Class 2 Creation Master Lin Yuan\u2019s retainer. I shall solemnly obey the responsibilities of a retainer, and if I violate the oath, I shall receive punishment from the willpower of the world.\u201dOnce Liu Jie\u2019s words turned silent, the purple Willpower Rune that was revolving around Liu Jie suddenly stopped. The rune appeared with a layer of mysterious chain, and it was locking up Liu Jie\u2019s Willpower Rune tightly on this end. On the other end of the chain was Lin Yuan\u2019s spiritual energy.Liu Jie could feel himself and Liu Jie forming a superior and subordinate relationship.This was a rune oath, and only people who comprehended Willpower Runes could take the oath. Violating it would cause the world\u2019s willpower to form a barrier, disallowing them to feel spirit qi again.It could be said to be the oath that was most intolerant of violation after the Spirit Qi Awakening. Once the rune oath was violated, an expert who could comprehend the world\u2019s willpower and form the rune would become an ordinary person who couldn\u2019t even feel spirit qi. Such a punishment was even harder to accept for spirit qi professionals than to kill them.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect Liu Jie to suddenly make the rune oath. Lin Yuan looked at Liu Jie and didn\u2019t know what to say for a moment.After obtaining two retainer crests today, Lin Yuan did think about taking in two retainers. However, he didn\u2019t expect to encounter such a situation and accept a retainer who was once a member of the Radiance Hundred\u2019s top Sequence member.Liu Jie might not be Sequence #39 of the Radiance Hundred anymore and had been neglected for two years, but if Liu Jie\u2019s Insect Queen fully recovered, it was possible for him to reach the same heights again.The two neglected years weren\u2019t actually wasted either. He might not have any increase in strength over two years, but the growth in his mental state was something that Liu Jie would have never obtained in the past.Liu Jie looked at Lin Yuan with an extremely calm expression and said, \u201cWith the oath taken, I am now your retainer or guardian knight. I wish to plead for you to help my Insect Queen recover. However, I have nothing on me as a repayment. I can only use myself. If you grant me a new life, I hand over the rest of my life to you.\u201dAfter observing Liu Jie\u2019s calm expression for a long time, Lin Yuan asked in return, \u201cIs it worth it to sacrifice the rest of your life?\u201dWhen Liu Jie heard Lin Yuan\u2019s question, he recalled how the Bamboo Monarch had said that the Insect Queen could only gradually recover with extremely pure spirit qi that didn\u2019t have any medicinal effects.It was something that even the Bamboo Monarch couldn\u2019t achieve. If a Class 5 Creation Master couldn\u2019t do it, then it was the same as giving Liu Jie a death sentence.During the past few years, Liu Jie had tried to look for other Creation Masters, but it was useless. As time elapsed, he no longer had any hopes. But it was unknown why this youth in front of him had spirit qi that could help his Insect Queen recover.This was Liu Jie\u2019s only opportunity. Let alone saying if it was worth it, since the choosing of a spirit qi occupation, one would have to face various choices and decisions. Each choice would cause the individual to enter a completely different path.Liu Jie had constantly been making choices, choosing the source-type lifeform, Insect Queen; choosing to strive and become Sequence member of the Radiance Hundred; choosing to protect the Cold Frost City; and choosing to become Lin Yuan\u2019s retainer knight now.Liu Jie didn\u2019t dare to say that each of his choices was absolutely perfect or were definitely great choices, but Liu Jie would never regret his choices.Liu Jie suddenly smiled, and that determined face revealed a little silly look. \u201cWorth it.\u201dThe days that Liu Jie couldn\u2019t be a spirit qi professional made him feel as though he was a walking corpse. Right now, the hopeful light was so dazzling that Liu Jie couldn\u2019t turn his eyes away.Lin Yuan reached out his hand solemnly and shook Liu Jie\u2019s hand.The duo might not be using much strength, but their handshake was rather firm.Lin Yuan pulled up Liu Jie and said, \u201cSince you chose to become my retainer knight, then I shall also fulfill my responsibilities. In a few days, I will help you Insect Queen to conduct an initial treatment.\u201dThe rune oath had subtly bound Liu Jie and Lin Yuan together. Liu Jie made the oath while Lin Yuan bearer, the latter could be at ease and accept Liu Jie\u2019s loyalty. In fact, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have to take responsibility, but Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t such a person.After receiving Liu Jie\u2019s loyalty, Lin Yuan immediately felt a heavier responsibility on himself.Liu Jie was an ex-member of the Radiance Hundred Sequence. If Lin Yuan said that such a person was his retainer, no one would believe him.After hearing Lin Yuan\u2019s response, Liu Jie let out an even sillier smile as Liu Jie knew that he didn\u2019t swear his loyalty to the wrong person.\u201cActually, even if you had asked me directly to heal your Insect Queen, I wouldn\u2019t have refused either.\u201dLiu Jie had risked everything for the Cold Frost City\u2014he had risked his glory and his dream just to offer protection. Such a person was someone that Lin Yuan would definitely respect and admire.Therefore, since Lin Yuan found out about Liu Jie\u2019s identity, he already had the thought of helping Liu Jie to heal his Insect Queen. However, he didn\u2019t think that Liu Jie would be so straightforward and choose to become his retainer knight.\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t do everything to walk to the end of their lives? Previously, I couldn\u2019t see any hope, so I could only live my life in a muddle-headed manner. Now that hope appeared, how can I not work hard to grasp it? From today onwards, I shall be the young master\u2019s sword and shield.\u201dWhen Liu Jie called Lin Yuan a young master, Lin Yuan immediately said, \u201cJust call me Lin Yuan. Will you go to the Xia Region with me right now? My home isn\u2019t in Redbud City.\u201dLiu Jie thought for a moment and said, \u201cLin Yuan, why don\u2019t I look for you in the Xia Region three days later? I have some things to settle for the next two days.\u201dLiu Jie might be living a muddle-headed life with no hope, but he had earned quite a lot of money during the past two years.Liu Jie had used the money to provide for over a dozen children and prepared an education fund for these children on the Star Web. The education fund included their school fees and also the expenditure required for choosing feys. Now that Liu Jie received another 120 Radiance dollars from Lin Yuan, it was enough for Liu Jie to save up the education fund\u2019s required money.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t ask what Liu Jie had to settle. If Lin Yuan knew, he would only feel more admiration. However, Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t do the same\u2014this might be due to his world outlook, choices, and priority.Lin Yuan opened up the box containing the two retainer crests.Lin Yuan had just obtained this box a few hours ago. He would never have imagined he would be giving out one of the retainer crests in just a few hours.Seeing the retainer crest handed over my Lin Yuan, Liu Jie grasped it in his hand and immediately wore it on his left chest.Liu Jie was surprised to receive the retainer crest, but it was also within his expectation.Liu Jie had conducted an oath towards Lin Yuan using his Willpower Rune, and the Radiance Federation didn\u2019t need any laws to ensure that Liu Jie would keep to the oath. But when Lin Yuan handed the retainer crest to Liu Jie, it was Lin Yuan\u2019s approval and validation toward Liu Jie.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTwo years ago, let alone Class 2 Creation Masters, Liu Jie had encountered plenty of Class 3 Creation Masters. He had even met one of the three Class 5 Creation Masters\u2014the Bamboo Monarch.But now, when Liu Jie wore this Class 2 Creation Master\u2019s retainer crest on his left chest, he felt as though the crest was emitting heat and made his heart scalding hot.Liu Jie looked at the small shield beside the two stars on the crest and knew of his responsibility for the rest of his life.After parting with Liu Jie, Lin Yuan headed straight to the Xia Region. He wasn\u2019t really at ease with leaving Chimey at home alone. Even if Chimey was a Bronze fey, Lin Yuan was still afraid something might happen to it. Ever since Lin Yuan had brought Chimey back home, this was the first time he had been away from Chimey for such a long time.After returning to the fey store, Lin Yuan opened the door, and Chimey immediately flew onto Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder when it heard the sound. It then jumped onto Lin Yuan\u2019s ear and used its little head to rub on his hair to express its yearning feelings.It had been a long time since Chimey had seen Lin Yuan, and it had truly missed him. In fact, Chimey hadn\u2019t even had the mood to stream its singing, causing a riot among Chimey\u2019s fans.Chimey had plenty of fans now, and none of the current music streamers on the Star Web were able to compete with it.Before Lin Yuan had the time to pacify Chimey, he suddenly saw the racks in the house that had all collapsed in a pathetic state. The wooden parts of the racks were all shattered, and the metallic parts had been distorted.Previously, Red Thorn was only slightly over half a meter in height. After evolving to elite-grade, it had grown to over one and a half meters. In addition, this was only the height of the Mouth of Relinquish.At that moment, the Mouth of Relinquish was like a wrinkled and thorny sphere. The thorns had several mouths, and they were all baring teeth on the outside.The previous multi-flora flowers\u2019 corrosive cavities had already transformed after evolving to normal-grade. Presently, there were eight more flowers like the two multi-flora flowers. They formed a circle with ten flowers and surrounded the Mouth of Relinquish.The multi-flora flowers were as big as a washbowl, and it was opened in an abnormal way.Lin Yuan could feel the Source Seed\u2019s data changing.If the ten flowers launched an attack, each of the flowers could spray out five liters of corrosive fluid within an instant. The intensity of the corrosive fluid was able to corrode sandstone and soil.As for the thorny vines that Lin Yuan asked for Red Thorn to enhance, they were now filled with five-centimeter-long spikes. Each of the vines could reach up to four meters, and there were a total of sixteen of them.If they started to thrash around, they would probably be able to rip and tear the enemy into pieces within an instant. Some vines were as long as six meters on the outer part, and these were newly grown vines. They didn\u2019t seem to be as lethal as the vines within the inner part. The jade-like vines were filled with three-centimeter-long reversed spikes. During combat, these vines were able to extend and retract.Lin Yuan noticed Red Thorn\u2019s elite-grade ability, Armor Shatter Rip. He felt that Red Thorn had already evolved into a lifeform that had extremely aggressive attacks.The Armor Shatter Rip was a great complement to both the outer vines, which had three-centimeter-long reversed spikes, or the inner vines, which had five-centimeter-long reversed spikes. When the vines were brandished, they had the Armor Shatter effect, and even a defense-type fey would have their flesh ripped open after a few lashes from the vines. In addition, the spikes were in a reversed hooked shape, so when the vines pulled, it would definitely rip off a piece of flesh.After evolving to elite-grade, the Source Seed, Red Thorn had intelligence. The blood contract formed with Lin Yuan allowed Red Thorn to feel close blood ties with him.Red Thorn then extended one of its inner vines. This vine was similar to the other inner vines, but it didn\u2019t have any spikes.The vine coiled around Lin Yuan\u2019s wrist, and he was able to clearly sense the intimate emotional waves that were emitted from Red Thorn. It was like a coquettish wheedle.Lin Yuan was able to vaguely feel Red Thorn\u2019s thoughts. It seemed like this vine was specially grown when Red Thorn evolved to elite-grade due to the intelligence, enabling Red Thorn to get closer with Lin Yuan.When Red Thorn felt Lin Yuan by its side, it gave off a delightful emotion and quickly influenced Lin Yuan. While looking at Red Thorn, Genius, Chimey, and also Morbius on his wrist, Lin Yuan felt particularly fulfilled.There was no longer any trace of fear for the unknown future. He was now looking forward to the future and wanted to move ahead at twice the speed.After preparing the Bronze alien insect flesh for Red Thorn, Lin Yuan logged onto the Star Web.He was rather apologetic for missing the appointment with Zhou Jiaxin. At the same time, he felt rather regretful that he couldn\u2019t pick out any rare and hidden goods.Lin Yuan was now planning to purchase a massive number of inferior energy ores.Firstly, after nurturing several Spirit-Siphon Goldfish batches, including those fish eggs produced by the Five Fortune Ranchu and the female Spirit-Siphon Goldfish, the inferior energy ores were running out.Secondly, Lin Yuan required a huge amount of pure spirit qi to heal the Insect Queen.In fact, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t feel that it was difficult to treat the Insect Queen\u2019s injuries. He just had to provide a large amount of pure spirit qi and keep up with the Insect Queen\u2019s consumption.As a source-type lifeform, the Insect Queen had a certain recovery capability, and with enough spirit qi supplied, it would only need a very short time to recover.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t send a message to Zhou Jiaxin this time and visited her store instead.After arriving at Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store, Lin Yuan quickly entered when he saw her standing inside.\u201cBig Sister Xin, I had been busy for the past two days, so I didn\u2019t make it for yesterday\u2019s appointment to pick those severely injured feys with damaged roots.\u201dZhou Jiaxin was looking through the store\u2019s accounts, and when she saw Lin Yuan, she immediately stood up.Zhou Jiaxin had thought through many things when Lin Yuan missed yesterday\u2019s appointment. She had sent a message to Lin Yuan but hadn\u2019t received a reply. After making an estimation, she had made a harsh decision to sell off a portion of those severely injured feys that arrived yesterday, but she had left behind the best ones.She had wanted to wait for Lin Yuan to visit and still have goods for him to choose.Zhou Jiaxin was a person who had bold ideas and actions. Since she had already determined that Lin Yuan had the backing of a Creation Master, before Lin Yuan expressed an obvious attitude, she was going to do everything that was required of her.When she was looking through the accounts, Zhou Jiaxin was rather distracted. Now that Lin Yuan visited the store, her heart was immediately at ease.As she stood up, she saw that Lin Yuan was wearing a Class 2 Creation Master crest. Zhou Jiaxin knew plenty of things about Creation Masters. For Lin Yuan to become a Class 2 Creation Master at such a young age, it had already answered her questions. Lin Yuan must have a huge pool of resources behind him that she could never imagine.Even if Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have any resources, Zhou Jiaxin felt that it was worth it for her to go all out to build a great relationship with Lin Yuan, who was such a young Class 2 Creation Master.\u201cWhy are you so polite? Big Sister Xin specially reserved a few of the better feys for you to pick. If you don\u2019t fancy any of them, I will sell them later.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 77Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayZhou Jiaxin\u2019s reply astonished Lin Yuan a little. A severely injured fey with damaged roots was extremely hard to store. Once the fey perished, the price wouldn\u2019t just drop by 10%. On any other normal business day, Zhou Jiaxin definitely wouldn\u2019t do the same. Otherwise, she would surely be making a loss when selling injured feys like this.Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store shouldn\u2019t have any Creation Master, but even if there was a Creation Master, wasting a Creation Master\u2019s time to maintain a severely injured fey\u2019s life was a losing business already. It was obvious that Zhou Jiaxin was doing so for Lin Yuan.No matter the reason, Lin Yuan was going to accept this favor.\u201cThen I shall thank Big Sister Xin for reserving those severely injured feys for me.\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s Spirit Lock spatial zone was already rather big after Morbius evolved to bronze-grade. By working in unison with Pure Land of Bliss and the highly concentrated spirit qi, it was extremely suitable to heal those feys with damaged roots.The prices of feys with damaged roots were only slightly higher than the price of the feys when broken down into spiritual ingredients. It was unknown how much cheaper it was as compared to a healthy fey. If Lin Yuan were able to purchase such injured feys and heal them before reselling them again, he would be able to earn much more than what he was doing now.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t just need a massive amount of dimensional lifeform flesh to nurture Red Thorn, but he also had to make preparations to upgrade the Jasmine Lily\u2019s quality to Legend.Lin Yuan had already made an appointment with the violent-tempered woman for the Revival Soil, and he would be able to obtain it in a few more days. As for the two Mahogany Tree Cores and one liter of Grasswood Fountain Water, Lin Yuan had yet to find a solution.The Grasswood Fountain Water might be available on the market, but one liter of Grasswood Fountain Water wasn\u2019t exactly cheap. Therefore, the accumulation of resources was Lin Yuan\u2019s first priority. While accumulating resources, Lin Yuan would also be subconsciously increasing his strength.When Zhou Jiaxin heard Lin Yuan expressing his thanks, her smile was even brighter. She had taken such measures before to build a good customer relationship in the past, but before doing so, the customer must be willing to accept the favor first. Otherwise, even if she did more than expected, it would be useless if the customer wasn\u2019t grateful for it.\u201cCome, follow me to the warehouse where I reserved three of the severely injured and near-death feys. Those three feys are the best among this batch of delivery.\u201dAfter speaking to Lin Yuan, Zhou Jiaxin informed the store staff, who was busy, and brought Lin Yuan toward the warehouse.Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s store staff was a lively and slightly chubby young lady. When Lin Yuan visited previously, the young lady hadn\u2019t seen him. Thus, this time, she finally encountered him.The young lady took a few glances at Lin Yuan. As a staff member of a fey and spiritual ingredient store, she noticed the Class 2 Creation Master crest on Lin Yuan\u2019s chest. Due to the instinctive reverence toward Creation Masters, even the lively young lady didn\u2019t dare to approach and greet Lin Yuan.When Lin Yuan was following Zhou Jiaxin to the warehouse, he could feel that Zhou Jiaxin had something to ask but didn\u2019t know how to ask even though she was making constant conversation.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expose it. He had a mere customer relationship with Zhou Jiaxin. If Zhou Jiaxin required his help on business matters, Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t mind helping. However, Zhou Jiaxin must be able to afford the price. If it was other matters that should be rejected, Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t hesitate to refuse as he wasn\u2019t a person who tried to be on good terms with everyone.After walking into the warehouse, Lin Yuan immediately saw a dying fey that was resting on the floor. It was an antelope.\u201cThis is a Sword Horn Speed Antelope, a rather good Silver fey. This Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s sword horn is in a good shape, and it is already at Silver X/Elite. It is just one step away from reaching gold-grade. Therefore, the flesh of this Sword Horn Speed Antelope is a good choice, be it to feed to a fey or for your own consumption.\u201d Zhou Jiaxin introduced the Sword Horn Speed Antelope.Zhou Jiaxin had put in quite the effort for this Sword Horn Speed Antelope as she had fed plenty of Bronze Usneas to it. Otherwise, the Sword Horn Speed Antelope wouldn\u2019t have survived until now.Lin Yuan walked over to look at the Sword Horn Speed Antelope and reached out his hand before placing it on the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s horn. The Sword Horn Speed Antelope struggled to lift its head and took a glance at Lin Yuan before its head sank back down again.The Sword Horn Speed Antelope obviously knew about its body condition, and given the intelligence of a Silver fey, it already understood the fate awaiting it. The vitality that was slowly leaking made the Sword Horn Speed Antelope feel increasingly weaker.Lin Yuan checked on the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s condition and stood back up. Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know the limits of his healing capability, so he was planning to use this Sword Horn Speed Antelope as an experiment. He wanted to see how much the Sword Horn Speed Antelope could recover if he used the Pure Land of Bliss within the Spirit Lock spatial zone and circulated his spirit qi at full force for one hour.Zhou Jiaxin might already know that Lin Yuan was a Class 2 Creation Master, but as a habit, she still gave detailed information of the Sword Horn Speed Antelope to Lin Yuan. \u201cThe injuries of this Sword Horn Speed Antelope might not be visible on the surface, but the injuries are rather bad on the inside. This Sword Horn Speed Antelope received a strong smashing impact, causing its inside organs to displace, and some of the organs have even ruptured. When I was feeding it some Bronze Usneas, it helped the Sword Horn Speed Antelope recover some energy. But from the condition now, the Sword Horn Speed Antelope won\u2019t last for more than five hours.\u201dLin Yuan had already inspected the injuries of the Sword Horn Speed Antelope earlier. Still, after listening to Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s explanation, he couldn\u2019t help but lament Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s method of business.For such severely injured feys, as long as it was still alive, the seller wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to explain about the injuries and predict the time of death. Just like the Sword Horn Speed Antelope, which didn\u2019t have any external injuries, other store owners would never specify that it would die within five hours. By doing so, it would cause the value of the fey to drop drastically.Lin Yuan was truly filled with admiration toward Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s business method, which was nothing but sincerity.\u201cBig Sister Xin, what is the price of this Sword Horn Speed Antelope?\u201dThe price of this dying Silver Sword Horn Speed Antelope wouldn\u2019t be very high. Even if the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s sword horn was in good condition, it wasn\u2019t considered some rare spiritual ingredient.When using the antelope\u2019s horn as a spiritual ingredient, it would normally be ground into powder form, so there wasn\u2019t a requirement for it to look good.The price of a Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s sword horn was comparable with the flesh price of a Silver fey that was over 70 catties.The Sword Horn Speed Antelope was an agile and nimble offense-type fey. It provided great damage and was easy to nurture. Thus, it was considered a rather popular fey.\u201c100 Radiance dollars will do.\u201d Zhou Jiaxin was very forthright.Lin Yuan calculated the price. It was rather fitting for 100 Radiance dollars to purchase a dead Sword Horn Speed Antelope. For a Sword Horn Speed Antelope in this condition, the price should be around 150 Radiance dollars. It was evident that Zhou Jiaxin had lowered the price for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUpon recalling how Zhou Jiaxin had been hesitant to say something, Lin Yuan understood. After this trade, Zhou Jiaxin wouldn\u2019t probably say what she wanted to say.Lin Yuan looked at Zhou Jiaxin and realized that she was looking at him too. Lin Yuan smiled and said, \u201cAlright.\u201dWhen Zhou Jiaxin saw Lin Yuan\u2019s expression, she was delighted too. Her actions were already very obvious, and a clever person could vaguely guess the meaning within her words. Since Lin Yuan didn\u2019t refuse, it meant it was possible for her to make the conversation later.After dealing with the Sword Horn Speed Antelope, Zhou Jiaxin pointed at a charred tree trunk at the side and said, \u201cThe next fey is this.\u201dLin Yuan could see that the pitch-black trunk was filled with scorched marks. Lin Yuan walked over and used his hand to touch on the scorched marks. He realized the spot he touched immediately withered upon contact. Lin Yuan was astonished.This tree trunk should have been burned by the flames of a demon from the Abyss Dimensional Rift. The marks on the trunk and the withering effects were very similar to the abyss flames.The trunk was bare, and there was nothing left. The roots under the trunk were only about half a meter long, and the rest were severed. There was also an opening on the tree trunk, and it was obvious that the tree core had been dug out. However, Lin Yuan could still feel faint traces of vitality within the tree.Only a high-grade wood-type spirit plant would be able to grow a tree core. Spirit plants with tree cores were silver-grade at worst. In other words, the pitiful tree that had been burned by the abyss flames was at least a Silver fey.Lin Yuan felt that if this tree could survive for so long and retain a trace of vitality after losing its core, it proved that this spirit plant wasn\u2019t normal. It might be a Gold spirit plant.Lin Yuan used True Data to check on the tree, and he got a shock after seeing the information.[Fey Name]: Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus[Fey Species]: Osmanthus genus/Osmanthus Fragrans species[Fey Grade]: Gold (4/10)[Fey Type]: Wood[Fey Quality]: FlawlessAbilities:[Osmanthus Fragrance]: The osmanthus fragrance could lift the mind\u2019s attention and eliminate fatigue.[Falling Flower]: Flowers bloom and wither to fall in four seasons. The fallen flowers can rapidly eliminate the poison within the target\u2019s body.[Clarity Flower Bud]: The flower buds that didn\u2019t manage to bloom contain nectar that could recover spiritual injuries.[Spirit of Osmanthus]: The osmanthus contains a fortuitous aura that could resist and eliminate damage from curses and also curse marks.Exclusive Skill:[Poison and Curse Removal]: Effectively remove all sorts of poisons that are hard to cure and break curse- and incantation-type spiritual poisons.At that moment, Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s voice echoed again. \u201cThis fey went through an appraisal and is a Gold spirit plant. It should be an osmanthus species.\u201dZhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t know much about this spirit plant either. She had only been able to find out that it was gold-grade and of the osmanthus species when she imported it.It had already been reduced to this state. If it weren\u2019t a Gold fey of the osmanthus species, Zhou Jiaxin wouldn\u2019t have kept it. Of course, even if this Gold osmanthus was in this state, if the core was still around, Zhou Jiaxin wouldn\u2019t have been able to afford it.Since ancient times, the osmanthus was one of the ten famous flowers. After the Spirit Qi Awakening, all ten of the famous flowers remained at the top, and the osmanthus was a luxurious and fortuitous flower too. Therefore, the osmanthus\u2019 price had remained at the top among the plant-type feys. In addition, the petals of the osmanthus were high-grade spiritual ingredients and also food. It made the price of the osmanthus even more ridiculous.Humans were always mindful of auspicious signs, and when it was combined with beauty, the price would definitely rise up many times more. As for existences that were auspicious, beautiful, and also had powerful effects, people would treat them as treasures. The osmanthus was such an existence.However, Zhou Jiaxin had brought back an osmanthus that was almost like charcoal, and the only thing that was worth some value was the thin layer of wood that wrapped around the core. It could be used as spiritual ingredients for gold-grade plants. However, it was only an ordinary spiritual ingredient, as most of the effective parts on the osmanthus plant were on the flower and leaves and not on the tree trunk.At that moment, Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t know that Lin Yuan was having completely different thoughts from her. This wasn\u2019t an ordinary osmanthus but a Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus, and it was one with the best combination of abilities and exclusive skill. The exclusive skill was able to enhance all four of the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus\u2019 abilities.This Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus was simply the nemesis of poison-type and curse-type feys. It wasn\u2019t just able to remove all sorts of poison. It could even cure and remove spiritual-type poisons. Even the curse-type poisons and curse marks that were hardest to remove could also be dealt with by this Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus.It was truly a cardinal treasure and could be known as the classic and pure healing-type fey. Apart from its abilities and exclusive skill, the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus was also a famed species among the osmanthus species. The flowers that bloomed would number in thousands as they hung on the branches and were even more radiant than the clouds during sunset.It was such a fey with a great auspicious aura, but the current state was truly miserable. If this Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus was placed in front of others, it might be useless and could only be used as a spiritual ingredient. However, when placed in front of Lin Yuan, if he planted it in the Pure Land of Bliss within the Spirit Lock spatial zone, the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus would certainly obtain new life in just a matter of time. It would bloom with numerous flowers that would cover the branches.This Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus was something that Lin Yuan must get. He might not be able to form a contract with the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus, but if it was planted within the Spirit Lock spatial zone, Lin Yuan could use the flowers from the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus to remove poisons.The Jasmine Lily might be able to heal injuries, but it couldn\u2019t remove poisons.Lin Yuan might not be able to use the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus\u2019 ability during combat, but he could make use of it daily when he was nurturing and healing feys.If he missed out on this Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus, he would need to spend a price that was hundreds or thousand times more to get another one.Take the Gold dragon-species feys\u2019 blood, for example. One drop of their blood would cost 80 Radiance dollars, but the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus\u2019 transaction price was even higher than Gold dragon-species feys.\u201cBig Sister Xin, how much are you selling this charred fey?\u201dWhen Lin Yuan was looking at the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus, he was tempted to release his spiritual power toward it. He held back, nonetheless. It was impossible that no Creation Masters had seen this fey before him. For a Gold fey like the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus, it was probable that Class 4 Creation Masters had also viewed it to see if it was worth healing. Presently, Lin Yuan was only a Class 2 Creation Master, and if he healed the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus here in front of Zhou Jiaxin, it wouldn\u2019t be a good thing for him.\u201cLin Yuan, don\u2019t be in a hurry. Another fey was delivered together with the osmanthus. Take a look at this fey first, and we will calculate the price together. To be honest, I was only able to obtain this osmanthus fey by chance. Osmanthus feys might be precious, but its current state isn\u2019t really helping. Furthermore, the other fey is said to have grown on this osmanthus tree previously. When they were transported over, it was cut down and placed in this box.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79: Cinnabar Osmanthus HaworthiaAfter speaking, Zhou Jiaxin approached the table by the side and searched through the brocade boxes. Most of the brocade boxes on this table were precious spiritual ingredients, and they were Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s treasured collection.While searching through them, Zhou Jiaxin said, \u201cThe third fey might have been living together with the osmanthus fey, but it isn\u2019t that obvious anymore. It has already withered, and it might lose all its vitality in just a short period of time.\u201dAfter searching for a long time, Zhou Jiaxin took out a brocade box and handed it over to Lin Yuan. She let out a bright smile and said, \u201cI shall only charge your 300 Radiance dollars for the osmanthus fey earlier. Treat this brocade box as a gift from Big Sister Xin to you.\u201dZhou Jiaxin hadn\u2019t been able to identify what was inside this brocade box either. However, when she had been inspecting it, it gave off spirit waves that belonged to a Gold fey. Therefore, it should be something good. Nonetheless, even if it was something good, Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t know what it was used for.When importing the feys, she had also obtained this brocade box as a gift for buying the osmanthus fey. Thus, she was just going to give it to Lin Yuan as a favor.Lin Yuan had put all his thoughts on that Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus and didn\u2019t really bother about the fey that Zhou Jiaxin handed over. However, he was stunned when he took a glance. The Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus was no longer able to grab Lin Yuan\u2019s attention.True Data revealed that the shriveled and black thing was actually a treasure that could enhance spiritual energy.[Fey Name]: Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia[Fey Species]: Haworthia species/Asphodelaceae genus[Fey Grade]: Gold (8/10)[Fey Type]: Grass[Fey Quality]: Flawless qualityThe Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia was a kind of companion fey, and it would only grow on places that were filled with auspicious and pure energy.Companion lifeforms were extremely rare, and even in the annual large-scale auction of the Rare Lifeform Pavilion, the Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia could serve as the final auction item.The Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia grew as the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus\u2019 companion, hence its name. When the haworthia grew with other plants, its name would change according to the plant.The Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia was part of the haworthia species and carried the traits. Instead of saying that the Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia was a fey, it was more like a spiritual ingredient that could evolve.The Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia didn\u2019t have any ability or exclusive skill, but it possessed lethal poison too. The Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia would only bear fruits once when reaching platinum-grade. It would bear three to five crystal-like fruits each time.It was always said that a spirit qi professional\u2019s injured spiritual energy was extremely hard to heal. It wasn\u2019t impossible to heal because the Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia\u2019s fruit could heal the spiritual energy to a certain degree. It was also one of the rare sacred lifeforms in the world that could heal injured spiritual energy.Even if a person didn\u2019t suffer from any spiritual energy injury, eating the Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia\u2019s fruit would have some effects. It would stimulate the brain and enhance spiritual energy.The Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia was truly a great treasure for Lin Yuan. His spiritual energy had been pitifully weak ever since he had contracted Morbius. Lin Yuan had also contracted Genius and Chimey when they weren\u2019t even considered feys. Moreover, Lin Yuan had gone unconscious for several days afterward.If Lin Yuan\u2019s spiritual energy could be enhanced, it would be considered a total transformation. Even if the increase in spiritual energy wasn\u2019t enough for Lin Yuan to contract more feys, it would still allow Lin Yuan to have a clearer mind. If the increase in spiritual energy was enough, it would be possible for Lin Yuan to contract new feys.As compared to the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus, the Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia was a greater surprise for Lin Yuan. However, in order for this Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia to grow, it had to grow on the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus.Currently, Lin Yuan wanted to purchase the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus and the Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia as soon as possible so that he could plant them and heal them.\u201cBig Sister Xin, I shall take both the feys, including the Sword Horn Speed Antelope. I will transfer the money together.\u201dSoon enough, Lin Yuan completed the transfer to Zhou Jiaxin.Zhou Jiaxin then stored the three near-death feys into the Ostrich Logistics\u2019 fey storage box and immediately arranged for delivery in front of Lin Yuan.Lin Yuan was truly grateful toward Zhou Jiaxin. She had reserved three feys for him, and it was the same as giving him a fated opportunity.When Lin Yuan saw that Zhou Jiaxin wanted to say something but was observing his expression, he spoke first. \u201cBig Sister Xin, since I am considered your regular customer, you can just speak.\u201dLin Yuan might have already guessed what Zhou Jiaxin wanted to say, but he couldn\u2019t be certain before she said it.Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t expect Lin Yuan to take the initiative before she could speak, and she was certainly overjoyed. If Lin Yuan didn\u2019t wish to help, he wouldn\u2019t take the initiative to ask. Since he asked, there might be a chance.Zhou Jiaxin had been in the trade for years, and when Lin Yuan said that he was a regular customer, Zhou Jiaxin heard it clearly. Lin Yuan clearly stated that he would be willing to help if it was in regards to her business. He was also stating that he might not help if it was something else. However, Zhou Jiaxin wasn\u2019t asking for Lin Yuan\u2019s help on other things as she just wanted to import goods from Lin Yuan\u2019s place.\u201cLin Yuan, Big Sister Xin knows that you have a store too, and it is selling those rare feys. I wonder if Big Sister Xin can import goods from your store?\u201dLin Yuan blinked his eyes. It seemed like he had guessed it correctly as it was about the importation of goods.His store might be selling common feys that had evolved, like the Usnea that wasn\u2019t even at normal-grade, and the Normal Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. These feys might be very common on the market when they were at the low-grade, but the Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish and the Bronze Usneas were rarely circulated in the market.Zhou Jiaxin had been operating her Star Web store for many years and had her own connections. It was possible for her to obtain one or two Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish and a pot or two of Bronze Usneas. However, it was impossible for her to import them in bulk.Lin Yuan had been producing around 100 Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish every three days on average. After another period of time, he would release a batch of Five Fortune Ranchu.Lin Yuan wanted to increase his spirit qi occupation rank and would need to evolve large numbers of Bronze Usneas. Therefore, selling some to Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t really matter.Zhou Jiaxin saw the contemplative look on Lin Yuan\u2019s face, so she quickly said, \u201cLin Yuan, Big Sister Xin isn\u2019t trying to purchase them from you at a low price. Big Sister Xin can purchase the goods from you at your store\u2019s cost price, plus 3%. To be honest with you, this is already the limit of my Class 3 store as I don\u2019t have any Creation Master\u2019s support. Big Sister Xin wishes to import some rare goods from you and see if I can promote the store to a Class 4 one by the end of the year.\u201dZhou Jiaxin spoke in a very sincere tone, and by telling her difficulties to Lin Yuan, she put out her attitude for a collaboration.Lin Yuan listened to Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s words and smiled before saying, \u201cThen let\u2019s do it according to what Big Sister Xin said. Every month, I can provide a limit of 200 Elite Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. But the Bronze Usneas will be a little lesser. I can only provide 50 pots.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 80": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 80Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter listening to Lin Yuan\u2019s response, Zhou Jiaxin was pleasantly surprised.Previously, Zhou Jiaxin felt that it would be good if she could import 20 Spirit-Siphon Goldfish and thought that she would only be able to import around 10 pots of Bronze Usneas a month. She never expected Lin Yuan\u2019s supply to be several times more than her imagination.With these resources, her store would no longer be a store that could only attract customers with the quality of her spiritual ingredients. With these rare goods, she would just need to supply a limited quantity, and the store\u2019s reputation would quickly improve. She would then host some activities to thank the customers.With such a trump, it was possible for her store to promote into a Class 4 one by the end of the year. It was a dream that she had for many years but didn\u2019t have any method to achieve.A single statement from Lin Yuan gave her the opportunity to make her dream into reality. The calm and composed Zhou Jiaxin didn\u2019t know what to do for a moment.Zhou Jiaxin was truly rejoicing from the decision that she made previously. If she hadn\u2019t shown any kindness to this young man previously, he wouldn\u2019t have reciprocated with so.Given the goods that the young man possessed, other stores that wanted to promote their class grade would be snatching for the chance even if the cost was increased by 10%.Zhou Jiaxin had already heard of the rumors on the feys that Lin Yuan sold. The quality was incredible, and the price affordable. Every time they appeared on the shelves, they would be wiped out in three minutes. It wasn\u2019t only the case, just the fact that Lin Yuan was a Class 2 Creation Master, it was already worth it for Zhou Jiaxin to build a good relationship.However, Lin Yuan\u2019s forthright actions made Zhou Jiaxin feel that the two of them didn\u2019t just have a relationship of benefits, but they were more like friends.\u201cLin Yuan, Big Sister Xin shall thank you first then. In the future, if you purchase spiritual ingredients from Big Sister Xin\u2019s store, I will sell them to you at cost price. Or if you need any spiritual ingredients that you cannot find, I can also help you to spread the news and find out.\u201dZhou Jiaxin had already opened up all her channels and connections to Lin Yuan. Actually, Zhou Jiaxin knew that her connections and channels were nothing for a Class 2 Creation Master. Well, it was more for those veteran Class 2 Creation Masters. For a new Class 2 Creation Master like Lin Yuan, who might still be respected because of his capability, but he wouldn\u2019t have sufficient connections, it was a boon.From now on, Zhou Jiaxin would become Lin Yuan\u2019s first connection and channel.\u201cBig Sister Xin, if you wish to aim for the promotion for a Class 4 store, I can provide you with 20 Elite Five Fortune Ranchus next month and 20 pots of Silver Usneas.\u201dAs one of his connections and channels, if Zhou Jiaxin could promote her store to a Class 4 one, it would be beneficial for Lin Yuan. Therefore, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t mind to offer Zhou Jiaxin help at this crucial moment and allow her to promote further. As a result, Zhou Jiaxin would bring more help and advantage to him.When Zhou Jiaxin heard Lin Yuan\u2019s proposal, she wasn\u2019t just delighted\u2014she was shocked. She was now certain that a veteran Class 3 Creation Master was backing Lin Yuan. It might not be a Class 3 Creation Master\u2014it could even be a Class 4 Creation Master!In the Radiance Federation, if a Class 5 Creation Master didn\u2019t interfere, the Class 4 Creation Masters were already the limit at the ceiling. Class 4 Creation Masters were existences that Zhou Jiaxin would never be able to encounter even if she wished for it. She finally understood that she had underestimated the strength of Lin Yuan\u2019s background.She was the one that had sold the Five Fortune Ranchu to Lin Yuan. In order to nurture the mother Five Fortune Ranchu\u2019s babies to elite-grade within a short one month, it was already more than what a regular Class 3 Creation Master could do. Moreover, there was the addition of those 20 pots of Usneas.Usneas were plants that weren\u2019t at normal-grade at first. It was far harder to evolve it to silver-grade than any other feys. There wasn\u2019t a need for the 20 Five Fortune Ranchus; just the impact of the 20 pots of Silver Usneas was enough for her store to promote to Class 4.Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s current priority was to prepare enough money to purchase those 20 Five Fortune Ranchus and 20 pots of Silver Usneas within this month. Normally, Zhou Jiaxin\u2019s money was mostly held up by the goods. For her to prepare so much money within a month was a challenge that was facing Zhou Jiaxin.After completing the trade with Zhou Jiaxin, Lin Yuan ordered another 50,000 catties of inferior energy ores from Zhou Jiaxin. She sold them to Lin Yuan at her cost price, which allowed Lin Yuan to save nearly half the money. It was evident that selling spiritual ingredients was truly profitable.After logging out of the Star Web, the Ostrich Logistics\u2019 courier arrived.Lin Yuan poured all of the inferior energy ores into the spirit pool, and after it dissolved a portion of them, there was a thick stack still remaining at the bottom.Immediately after, Lin Yuan brought the fey storage boxes that contained the Sword Horn Speed Antelope, Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia, and Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus to the Pure Land of Bliss within the Spirit Lock spatial zone.He then opened up the box that contained the Sword Horn Speed Antelope first. The concentrated spirit qi entered the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s skin and nourished its body while also repairing the damaged organs within the Sword Horn Speed Antelope while it breathed.Lin Yuan stroked the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s body gently and rapidly channeled spirit qi to help the Sword Horn Speed Antelope recover.The Sword Horn Speed Antelope looked at Lin Yuan with gratitude and used its cheek to rub on Lin Yuan\u2019s hand. Subsequently, it laid down on the Pure Land of Bliss to rest under Lin Yuan\u2019s instruction.1The Sword Horn Speed Antelope was very small and took up a small place within the Pure Land of Bliss. It curled up its body and quickly fell asleep while spirit qi gradually entered its body, slowly healing its injuries.Next up, Lin Yuan was going to be busy with a huge project.He opened up the two gold-grade fey storage boxes. Lin Yuan put in a huge effort to plant the charred Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus at the Pure Land of Bliss\u2019 border. At the same time, he carefully placed the Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia in the wrinkled part of the tree trunk. He believed the Cinnabar Osmanthus Haworthia would grow roots on the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus soon enough.Lin Yuan then circulated his spiritual power at full force to channel spirit qi into the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus.After some hard work, even inside the Pure Land of Bliss, the effects weren\u2019t obvious. The Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus was a Gold fey for a reason. With Lin Yuan\u2019s D-rank spirit qi professional\u2019s spiritual power, it was still rather difficult for him to heal a Gold fey.Lin Yuan sensed the spirit qi capacity within his body. After many days of effort in evolving feys, Lin Yuan was already making progress from a D-rank spirit qi professional as his spirit qi capacity was only half of a C-rank spirit qi professional.Lin Yuan immediately purchased a huge number of Usneas. For the next period of time, Lin Yuan was planning to break through and become a C-rank spirit qi professional first. As such, Lin Yuan reverted to the state where he forgot about sleep and food.He was constantly evolving feys without rest.Soon enough, three days passed, and Lin Yuan was just one step from becoming a C-rank spirit qi professional.At that moment, a knocking sound came from the small store\u2019s door.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81: A Reborn Liu JieLin Yuan looked at the time and didn\u2019t know that three days had already passed. After three full days of fey evolution, Lin Yuan could feel the significant increase in his spirit qi capacity.After glancing at the Bronze Usneas that filled the house, he stood up and stretched his body before walking toward the entrance. He opened the door and saw Liu Jie standing there.Liu Jie was already different from before as his entire aura had undergone an obvious change. His eyes were filled with vigor and vitality. A living person should have an objective, and even if there wasn\u2019t an objective, there should be a direction. The reborn Liu Jie now had an objective and also a direction.\u201cCome, enter the house. Have the last three days been smooth?\u201dLiu Jie nodded.\u201cI have already done everything I needed to do during the past three days. In the future, I will only be heeding instructions from the Young Master.\u201dLin Yuan didn\u2019t correct Liu Jie\u2019s way when addressing himself. After the Spirit Qi Awakening, retainers were considered a new kind of relationship between humans.Liu Jie was only complying with the etiquette of being a retainer, so there wasn\u2019t a need for Lin Yuan to correct Liu Jie every time.Lin Yuan then led Liu Jie into the house.Chimey and Genius immediately ran up Lin Yuan\u2019s shoulder and looked at Liu Jie curiously. Red Thorn, which was still consuming food by the side, had also sensed a stranger entering. That spikeless vine was immediately placed on Lin Yuan. It felt just like an alarm, and once Lin Yuan gave the instructions, Red Thorn would immediately launch out its vines to envelop Liu Jie.When Liu Jie saw Genius and Chimey on Lin Yuan, and also Red Thorn behind Lin Yuan, he lamented before being envious.Genius was a small cat with two tails and tender, soft fur while having limbs of uneven length.Chimey was only half a fist in size and was a small bird with azure blue feathers that had beautiful cloud patterns.No matter who saw these two little fellows, they wouldn\u2019t be able to know that it was the Hundred Questions Beast, a domestic pet, and also the Songstress Bird that could only sing.Red Thorn\u2019s sinister appearance was filled with murderous intent, and a single glance was enough for Liu Jiu to know that Red Thorn was a fey with extreme lethality.Watching how intimate Lin Yuan was with his three feys, Liu Jie involuntarily recalled about his source-type lifeform, the Insect Queen.Even though Liu Jie knew that Lin Yuan could heal his Insect Queen, before the Insect Queen completely recovered, Liu Jie would remember his Insect Queen, which had transformed into a cocoon due to its near-death state, causing throbbing pain in Liu Jie\u2019s heart.Liu Jie poured a cup of water for Liu Jie while explaining to Genius, Chimey, and Red Thorn about Liu Jie\u2019s status. Red Thorn finally calmed down and continued to consume food and take in energy in order to evolve.\u201cWhat are you planning to do in the future? If I don\u2019t have any arrangements for you.\u201dLin Yuan put the teacup on the table beside Liu Jie before he sat on the chair and drank his own tea.Lin Yuan\u2019s question made Liu Jie frown and contemplate.A retainer\u2019s responsibility was to follow by the Creation Master\u2019s side since the retainer was the Creation Master\u2019s shield and also the sword. Most of the retainers would be acting according to the Creation Master\u2019s instruction.After being asked by Lin Yuan about his future plans, Liu Jie truly didn\u2019t know what to answer because he was planning to listen to Lin Yuan\u2019s instructions and heed to Lin Yuan\u2019s plans.Lin Yuan saw Liu Jie was contemplating, so he spoke, \u201cYou must be unwilling to accept the fact that your status as Sequence #39 was removed from the Radiance Hundred because of your injuries two years ago, right?!\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s question immediately probed on the problem that Liu Jie had been avoiding all this time. Becoming a member of the Radiance Hundred was always the glory that Liu Jie sought for.Liu Jie didn\u2019t regret protecting Cold Frost City, and if he was given a chance to choose again, he would still risk his life to do the same. However, Liu Jie would still be unwilling to accept the fact that he was removed from the Radiance Hundred.Therefore, once Liu Jie had found that his Insect Queen couldn\u2019t recover, he never even participated in the Radiance Hundred\u2019s ranking matches. Given Liu Jie\u2019s contribution, if he went, he might even be able to retain his sequence ranking in the Radiance Hundred. At worst, Liu Jie would also be able to enter the Radiance Hundred\u2019s honorary hall.However, due to his pride and the fact that he didn\u2019t wish to be pitied, Liu Jie gave up on the opportunity. He gave up on the Radiance Hundred by missing out on the ranking matches and used his own effort to strive to become a Sequence member again.Am I willing to accept? Of course not!Lin Yuan saw Liu Jie\u2019s expression and already knew of Liu Jie\u2019s thoughts. Lin Yuan smiled and said, \u201cI know that you will be unwilling to accept. If so, why don\u2019t you stand back up again? Stand back up as a Sequence member of the Radiance Hundred?\u201dLiu Jie\u2019s words were like an explosion that blasted on Liu Jie\u2019s head. Liu Jie didn\u2019t dare to think like this. He had already used the Willpower Rune to swear an oath to be this young man\u2019s retainer. From that moment on, Liu Jie had already expelled thoughts for himself and considered everything from the angler of a retainer.Lin Yuan\u2019s words gave Liu Jie an indescribable feeling.Am I still able to do so?Immediately after, Liu Jie\u2019s gratitude toward Lin Yuan was overflowing like the endless ocean.Liu Jie, who had gritted his teeth and endured it after finding out that his Insect Queen couldn\u2019t recover, he who had tasted both the ruthlessness of this world now had red eyes. Hot tears rolled down and dripped into the cup, causing splashes and giving the cup of water a salty and bitter taste.Lin Yuan looked at Liu Jie and immediately patted on Liu Jie\u2019s shoulder. \u201cSummon your Insect Queen. I want to see how long it will require for your Insect Queen to recover. If it is fast enough, you might even make it for the Radiance Hundred\u2019s ranking match at the end of the year. If you go there, I am sure it will not be a problem for you to get the qualification to participate.\u201dLiu Jie didn\u2019t wipe the hot tears that were rolling down. Instead, he lifted his head up and looked at Lin Yuan with a deep gaze, as though he was trying to remember the moment.After a long period of time, Liu Jie revealed a rather silly smile. With his tears still around, this smile looked rather miserable.However, Lin Yuan knew that Liu Jie\u2019s smile was the sign that the dark days were over, and Liu Jie had finally obtained a new life.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but recall Elder Ning\u2019s statement. \u201cA Creation Master doesn\u2019t just save feys, but also humans.\u201dLiu Jie summoned his Insect Queen and held it carefully in his hands.Lin Yuan placed his palm on the Insect Queen\u2019s flesh cocoon, and he circulated his spiritual power to rapidly channel spirit qi into the flesh cocoon.The dark purple flesh cocoon actually started thumping like a heart. With each thump, it would emit a mild and light purple radiance. At the same time, Lin Yuan could feel that the Insect Queen had completely absorbed all the spirit qi he channeled.After absorbing the pure spirit qi for one hour, Lin Yuan could feel that the Insect Queen could constantly thump gently and wouldn\u2019t stop once he stopped channeling his spirit qi.This meant that the Insect Queen\u2019s vitality and life functions had been reactivated. The Insect Queen might still be in a near-death state, but it wouldn\u2019t be in a state where it was in suspended animation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 82": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 82Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yuan made calculations. He might not be able to make an accurate calculation of the Insect Queen\u2019s recovery time. Still, after a preliminary calculation, if the Insect Queen recovered in the Pure Land of Bliss inside the Spirit Lock spatial zone, it would take around two months to reach about 80% recovery.As the Insect Queen\u2019s contractor, Liu Jie was naturally able to sense the Insect Queen\u2019s changes. When the Insect Queen was able to thump constantly, Liu Jie\u2019s heart had also started to thump suddenly.Liu Jie was able to sense that his Insect Queen couldn\u2019t recover its spiritual consciousness yet, but its body was gradually recovering, and Liu Jie could feel it clearly.During this one hour, Liu Jie had been carefully holding the cocoon and didn\u2019t dare to move an inch as he was afraid of disturbing Lin Yuan. When Lin Yuan shifted his hand away from the cocoon, Liu Jie asked carefully, \u201cThis\u2026 How is my Insect Queen\u2019s situation?\u201dFor a person who had just been given hope, he wasn\u2019t able to receive another blow of disappointment.Therefore, Lin Yuan immediately replied, \u201cIf you leave your Insect Queen with me, it will be healthy again in around two months. You will also be able to make it for this year\u2019s Radiance Hundred rankings match.\u201dLiu Jie already knew that Lin Yuan could heal the Insect Queen, but he didn\u2019t expect Lin Yuan was actually able to heal it so quickly. It was truly a pleasant surprise.Liu Jie then handed the constantly thumping Insect Queen to Lin Yuan. Lin Yuan held onto the Insect Queen and started to constantly channel pure spirit qi into it.\u201cYoung Master, what instructions do you have for me during this period?\u201dWhile Lin Yuan helped him heal the Insect Queen, Liu Jie didn\u2019t want to idle around. He wanted to help out Lin Yuan as a retainer.Lin Yuan did have something for Liu Jie to do. \u201cLiu Jie, how much do you know about the Royal Capital?\u201dLiu Jie immediately replied after Lin Yuan asked the question, \u201cI studied in the Royal Capital\u2019s university and lived there for around seven to eight years. I am rather familiar with the Royal Capital and can be considered a local tyrant. However, I haven\u2019t been to the Royal Capital for over two years, so I don\u2019t know how much it has changed by now.\u201dLin Yuan nodded and asked another question, \u201cWhat do you feel if I am to open a store in the Royal Capital after this year?\u201dLin Yuan had his own plans too. After Chu Ci finished studying at the Redbud Intermediate Spirit Qi Academy, she should study in the Royal Capital if she wanted to further her studies.The Royal Capital was the Radiance Federation\u2019s central hub, and it took up the land space of up to four Redbud Cities. Lin Yuan might as well set up a store in the Royal Capital earlier and pave the path for Chu Ci.Before the end of the year, Lin Yuan was going to strengthen himself several times and upgrade his spirit qi occupation to C-rank. At the same time, he wanted to evolve all his feys to silver-grade and above.All those things weren\u2019t considered too difficult. The most difficult task was to upgrade the Bronze Jasmine Lily\u2019s quality to Legend quality and transform it into a Fantasy Breed.The second Willpower Rune that Lin Yuan had comprehended from the massacre was very suitable for Red Thorn. Lin Yuan still had a method to upgrade the Elite Red Thorn\u2019s quality to Epic, but he didn\u2019t think he could upgrade the Bronze Red Thorn\u2019s quality to Legend. It was because Red Thorn couldn\u2019t absorb spirit qi and could only accumulate energy from flesh.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t a true Creation Master, after all. He could only use his unique method to evolve feys, upgrade their quality, and heal their roots.Seeing how Lin Yuan could heal the Insect Queen, Liu Jie couldn\u2019t help but lament at Lin Yuan\u2019s Creation Master skill and potential. Now that Lin Yuan had the intention to develop in the Royal Capital, Liu Jie was definitely approving with both hands raised.The Royal Capital was a place where only people with true capabilities were able to establish themselves and hold firm. The number of resources and opportunities there weren\u2019t something the Redbud City could compare with.Given Lin Yuan\u2019s talent and capability, it would truly be a waste if he didn\u2019t develop in the Royal Capital.\u201cYoung Master, I feel that if you wish to develop, it is best to head for the Royal Capital. Only after reaching the Royal Capital will you realize that the difference between a prosperous city and the Royal Capital isn\u2019t just \u2018slightly\u2019.\u201dLin Yuan went into deep contemplation and felt that Liu Jie naturally wouldn\u2019t be wrong with his knowledge and experiences.Since Lin Yuan already had the thoughts, he immediately made the decision. He was going to seal up this little store as it would be the warm home that belonged to himself and Chu Ci forever. It was also the place where he started off in the beginning.Lin Yuan was a person that dared to act on his ideas. He immediately transferred 500 Radiance dollars to Liu Jie\u2019s account. Lin Yuan\u2019s current earning speed was far beyond what he could before. Thus, Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t as frugal as before when spending.\u201cGo to the Royal Capital and help me to scout out the situation. Find a suitable place for a store, and if a good store is being sold, contact me directly.\u201d2The prices of the stores in the Royal Capital were far higher than Redbud City\u2019s. In order to find a good spot in the Royal Capital to open a store, the prices would definitely be high.Lin Yuan had the confidence to say such words due to the Five Fortune Ranchus that were about to hatch\u2014they numbered around 1,000! Another reason was due to the piece of land in Redbud City that Ling Xiao had given him when he became a Class 2 Creation Master.Instead of saying that that piece of land had a store, it was better to say that it was a manor that was more than 1,800 square meters. Lin Yuan had chosen the land, and the land deed had already been delivered by Ostrich Logistics to him two days ago.Lin Yuan was free to do anything with that piece of land. If there was really a suitable store in the Royal Capital, Lin Yuan could just sell off the manor in Redbud City. This way, he would have the initial deposit required for the store in the Royal Capital.His earning speed would be increased by several times after some time, especially when he progressed to a C-rank spirit qi professional. Lin Yuan spoke with more confidence due to all these conditions.\u201cYoung Master, do you have any requests for the store?\u201d\u201cBest if it has a large space. I don\u2019t have any other requests.\u201dLin Yuan believed that with his capability and batch production of rare feys, even if he was located in a secluded place in the Royal Capital, it wouldn\u2019t affect his development.Liu Jie was originally prepared to note down Lin Yuan\u2019s request as this was the first mission Lin Yuan had given him, so he was particularly serious. However, Liu Jie didn\u2019t expect Lin Yuan to only have one request.After acknowledging the instructions, Liu Jie headed for the Royal Capital. Lin Yuan placed the Insect Queen inside the Pure Land of Bliss and then added plenty of inferior energy ores into the spirit pool.During the past few days, the consumption speed of inferior energy ores was very fast, so Lin Yuan had to purchase another large batch of inferior energy ores. They were all stocked up inside the Spirit Lock spatial zone and prepared to supply to the spirit pool.However, after purchasing this batch of inferior energy ores, Lin Yuan already had plans to purchase low-grade energy ores. In terms of value, inferior energy ores were better for the spirit pool, but it took up time for Lin Yuan to add the energy ores into the spirit pool.Presently, Lin Yuan was no longer as free as before. Different circumstances called for different solutions, and low-grade energy ores were indeed more suitable than inferior energy ores right now.Lin Yuan then started to enhance feys for seven days without any care for fatigue or hunger. He felt that he was just one step away from becoming a C-rank spirit qi professional.Just as he was planning to log into the Star Web and order another batch of goods, he noticed that he received information from the Redbud City Lordess, Ling Xiao.Lin Yuan lifted his brows as he didn\u2019t know why Ling Xiao was looking for him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs the City Lordess of Redbud City, it wasn\u2019t exaggerating to say that Ling Xiao had to make use of every minute of the day. All major and minor matters within Redbud City required her attention and decisions.Previously, when Redbud City had issued the reward to him, Ling Xiao hadn\u2019t appeared personally. It was one of her subordinate officers instead. In Lin Yuan\u2019s opinion, it was already his great honor, nonetheless.But now, the Redbud City Lordess, Ling Xiao, actually looked for him personally.Ling Xiao: \u201cLin Yuan, I am Redbud City Lordess Ling Xiao. Two days later, someone will fetch you from the Xia Region. By then, someone will contact you directly. You might need to make preparations for a long-distance trip.\u201dWhen Lin Yuan received Ling Xiao\u2019s message, he used his hands to rub his temples. The message came in a very sudden manner, and Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know the purpose of the trip. The message that Ling Xiao sent didn\u2019t contain any information either. When Ling Xiao sent this message, instead of saying it was an inquiry, it was more of a notification.Lin Yuan recalled the benefits that Elder Ning had mentioned before. As of now, he had only obtained a piece of land with a store within Redbud City. However, the benefits that Elder Ning had mentioned definitely didn\u2019t refer to this store and land. In other words, this trip might be for a benefit that even Elder Ning would be envious of.If it was a long-distance trip, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have much he had to prepare for. If there was anything to prepare, it would be to accumulate more energy ores within the Spirit Lock spatial zone so as to have a constant supply.Thus, Lin Yuan directly purchased another 10,000 catties of low-grade energy ores and 10,000 catties of mid-grade energy ores from Big Sister Xin.Low-grade energy ores contained spirit qi that was five times as concentrated as inferior energy ores, while mid-grade energy ores contained spirit qi five times as concentrated as low-grade energy ores.When purchasing this batch of low-grade and mid-grade energy ores, the price was indeed much higher than the inferior energy ores. However, when purchasing such fundamental resources, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t feel any constraint at all.When transporting the 10,000 catties of low-grade and mid-grade energy ores into the Spirit Lock spatial zone, Lin Yuan noticed that the Sword Horn Speed Antelope was already standing up on the Pure Land of Bliss.Lin Yuan approached to check and realized that the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s injuries had already recovered during this period of time. When the Sword Horn Speed Antelope saw Lin Yuan walking over, it immediately rushed over and stopped in front of Lin Yuan. It extended its tongue to lick at Lin Yuan\u2019s fingers. It was a sign of it thanking Lin Yuan for rescuing it from its severely injured state.Lin Yuan then took some Bronze Usnea vines and fed them to the Sword Horn Speed Antelope. After recovering, the Sword Horn Speed Antelope ate the leaves on the Bronze Usnea vines. Its great appetite had finally been restored.Lin Yuan watched the Sword Horn Speed Antelope eat. The Sword Horn Speed Antelope was already a Silver X/Elite fey when it was injured, and it was just one step away from reaching gold-grade.In addition, Lin Yuan felt that his spirit qi concentration within his D-rank spirit qi professional\u2019s body had already reached the full capacity. The misty spirit qi within his body felt as though it could transform into liquid spirit qi at any moment.Previously when Lin Yuan had been promoted into a D-rank spirit qi professional, the amount of misty spirit qi within his body had only one streak. Right now, his body was filled with spirit qi that had all converted into misty spirit qi.When the misty spirit qi clashed and was about to condense into liquid form, it would scatter again. Lin Yuan knew that he required an opportunity. If he wanted to continue evolving Bronze Usneas to break through this barrier, it would be the same as dripping water to penetrate a stone. If he was able to evolve this Silver Sword Horn Speed Antelope to gold-grade, it would be the same as a concentrated torrent, allowing Lin Yuan to blast through this obstacle.Lin Yuan placed his hand on the Sword Horn Speed Antelope, which had already eaten to its full, and he circulated his spiritual power at full force. He made use of the spirit qi within the Spirit Lock spatial zone, which was several times more concentrated than the outside world, to enhance the Sword Horn Speed Antelope.Lin Yuan was uncertain how long it would take to evolve a Silver fey to gold-grade, but in order to not delay the appointment he had two days later with Ling Xiao, Lin Yuan set an alarm.It was unknown how long passed as Lin Yuan converted and channeled spirit qi for thousands of times. Ultimately, it broke through the obstructive layer within the Sword Horn Speed Antelope with undying determination and spirit.The moment when the obstruction was broken through, the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s body glowed with a resplendent golden luster. At that moment, the Sword Horn Speed Antelope was going through a life-changing metamorphosis. It was progressing from Silver X to Gold.During the metamorphosis, the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s horns were the first to transform. The Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s sword horns were straight like a sharp sword, but now, its straight horns didn\u2019t continue growing. Instead, they were actually shrinking and transforming into curved horns.The Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s body size shrunk in just a moment until it was just a third of the original size. Its coffee-colored fur was also constantly turning lighter and finally ending toward more of a khaki and milky color.When the originally nimble Sword Horn Speed Antelope reached gold-grade, it underwent a thorough spiritual mutation. It was now a small cute lifeform.After shrinking down, the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s legs became slender and longer. They were filled with power, and it gave the body a streamlined shape and more explosive power, allowing it to become even more nimble.The Sword Horn Speed Antelope wasn\u2019t just able to use its basic ability to smash enemies with its sword horns, but it could even use the sword horns to slice at the air to form air blades that could attack enemies from a distance. With the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s nimble movements, it could easily take the role of a long-distance assassin.Lin Yuan used True Data to check on the Gold Sword Horn Speed Antelope. This cute little antelope in front of him already had a different name after reaching gold-grade. It was no longer called the Sword Horn Speed Antelope.[Fey Name]: Wind Speed Rapid Antelope[Fey Species]: Artiodactyla genus/Antelope species[Fey Grade]: Gold (1/10)[Fey Type]: Wind[Fey Quality]: EliteAbilities:[Horn Smash]: Using the horns on the head to smash the enemy.[Horn Blade]: Using the sharp horns to slice the air and form air blades to attack and slash enemies from afar.[Protection of Wind]: Wind energy floats around the body\u2019s surface, forming a layer of wind force shield.[Sword Strike Storm]: Summons a storm that covers a massive area, conducting a large sweeping attack. The storm is filled with air swords that could slice metal plates.Exclusive Skill:[Agile Wind]: When controlling the wind, it could increase the flow of wind and increase the speed of wind-type abilities.The Wind Speed Rapid Antelope was a rather uncommon evolution path for the Sword Horn Speed Antelope. It gave up on its close-combat capabilities and turned into a violent spellcaster.It was rather obvious just by looking at the gold ability, Sword Strike Storm. The Wind Speed Rapid Antelope could circulate spiritual power to summon a storm that covered a massive area, conducting a sweeping attack. The storm even contained air swords that could cut metal plates.It was considered an extremely violent multi-target ability. Apart from the Sword Horn Speed Antelope\u2019s basic ability, all the other abilities were a perfect combination for the Wind Speed Rapid Antelope.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 84": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 84Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOther than this Wind Speed Rapid Antelope\u2019s cute appearance, its price could definitely grow by a few times.Lin Yuan patted the evolved Wind Speed Rapid Antelope with satisfaction and thought to himself,\u00a0This fellow has really done well and will fetch a good price.The Wind Speed Rapid Antelope was looking at Lin Yuan with bright, sparkling eyes while using the soft fur and cute horns to rub at Lin Yuan\u2019s hand. It was thanking Lin Yuan for allowing its life to transform. Perhaps, not long after, Lin Yuan would sell off this Wind Speed Rapid Antelope and allow it to have its own spirit qi professional as a partner. It would also be benefiting the spirit qi professional. This was the best outcome for the Wind Speed Rapid Antelope.At that moment, Lin Yuan felt the return of spirit qi from the Wind Speed Rapid Antelope, allowing him to immediately break through the barrier from a D-rank to a C-rank spirit qi professional.Once the spirit qi entered his body, the misty spirit qi started to condense within his body. Finally, the misty spirit qi condensed a drop of glistening water droplet. Subsequently, more misty spirit qi gathered toward the water droplet and enlarged the water droplet\u2019s size.At that moment, Lin Yuan knew that he had officially become a C-rank spirit qi professional.The alarm that Lin Yuan had set previously had yet to ring, but his phone rang instead. When Lin Yuan picked up the phone, he saw an unfamiliar number. Lin Yuan\u2019s contact list had only a few phone numbers: Chu Ci\u2019s number and a few of the numbers he used for importing goods. The numbers included Yang Mingkai, Liu Jie, Ah Neng, and a few others.Even Zhou Jiaxin was only contacted on the Star Web.If his phone was ringing now, it was probably the person that Ling Xiao had sent.After picking up the phone call, before Lin Yuan could speak, a rather respectful voice was transmitted. \u201cLord Lin Yuan, I am one of Lordess Ling Xiao\u2019s subordinate officers. My name is Ling Wu, and I am now at the Xia Region\u2019s governor residence waiting for your arrival.\u201dLin Yuan never expected for anyone to address him as a \u2018lord\u2019. According to Lin Yuan\u2019s status as a Class 2 Creation Master, it was fine for him to be called a \u2018lord\u2019, but it depended on the other party.If it was someone looking for Lin Yuan\u2019s help or some spirit qi professionals, addressing Lin Yuan as \u2018lord\u2019 was very normal. However, Ling Wu was the City Lordess Ling Xiao\u2019s subordinate officer, and for Ling Wu to address him as a \u2018lord\u2019, Lin Yuan was rather surprised.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have many things to pack along, and the Spirit Lock spatial zone already had sufficient stock of energy ores. The Blue Flash Butterfly\u2019s cocoon was also placed on a table within the Spirit Lock spatial zone, and Lin Yuan was just waiting for it to hatch. Lin Yuan reckoned that the hatching would take place in the next two days.In fact, during the recent period of time, Lin Yuan never channeled any spirit qi into the butterfly cocoon to help with the Blue Flash Butterfly\u2019s hatching process. There was a reason\u2014the Blue Flash Butterfly\u2019s hatching was nature\u2019s work. If Lin Yuan were to hasten this process, it would be as if he was trying to change nature\u2019s divine work to a certain degree.The Blue Flash Butterfly might hatch earlier, but the vitality and evolution potential would suffer a huge decline as compared to natural hatching. Thus, even if Lin Yuan was in a hurry to make the Blue Flash Butterfly into Morbius\u2019 Bronze spirit-locked fey, Lin Yuan still waited patiently.Creation Masters might be able to evolve feys and upgrade their quality, and in certain aspects, Creation Masters were just like omnipotent gods. However, when feys were transforming, if a Creation Master interfered, it would only harm the said living creature\u2019s evolution potential.Since there was nothing to pack, Lin Yuan replied, \u201cAfter receiving Lordess Ling Xiao\u2019s message, I have already finished packing. I will head over to the governor residence now.\u201dAfter hanging up the phone call, Lin Yuan exited from the Spirit Lock spatial zone and circulated his spiritual energy to store Genius, Chimey, and Red Thorn into his Spirit Lock spatial zone.In normal times, Lin Yuan wouldn\u2019t store Genius, Chimey, and Red Thorn into the Spirit Lock spatial zone, as he preferred to let them live in the outside world along with him. For this long-distance trip, even though Lin Yuan might have methods to bring Genius and Chimey along by his side, they didn\u2019t work for the massive Red Thorn. Hence, Lin Yuan decided to store them all within the Spirit Lock spatial zone.Originally, Lin Yuan was planning to check his capabilities\u2019 changes after progressing into a C-rank spirit qi professional. He wanted to see how much faster he could evolve Usneas and whether his healing ability could affect the Cinnabar Sweet Osmanthus more. Unfortunately, he didn\u2019t have the time.After donning a neat attire, Lin Yuan looked into a mirror at a radiant and handsome youth. He let out a smile, revealing his white teeth, before heading straight for the regional governor residence.Even though Lin Yuan had been living in the Xia Region for many years, he was still very unfamiliar with the regional governor residence. Previously, Lin Yuan had always been living his life in a routine and had never stepped foot into the regional governor residence.Lin Yuan felt as though he was living another life as he headed to the regional governor\u2019s residence.After alighting the Thick-Hoofed Donkey Car in the regional governor residence\u2019s vicinity, Lin Yuan walked less than three minutes to reach his destination.Numerous people were at the regional governor residence\u2019s entrance, and a rather tanned man was in the center, surrounded by the group. Lin Yuan actually recognized a few of the individuals within the group.As a Xia Region citizen, Lin Yuan naturally knew how the Region Governor looked, and he was none other than the man standing beside the tanned man.The other individuals standing beside the Region Governor were people that Lin Yuan had met before too. He had to talk with them before opening his little fey story. However, the conversation back then was one way. Lin Yuan knew them, but they wouldn\u2019t remember an insignificant person like the Lin Yuan from back then.The tanned man had also seen Lin Yuan and quickly walked a few steps forward before he waved and said, \u201cLord Lin Yuan arrived really quickly. I just arrived here, and Lord Lin Yuan is already here.\u201dThe Region Governor only knew that Ling Wu was the subordinate officer under Lordess Ling Xiao. When Ling Wu had arrived here, he hadn\u2019t said anything apart from that he was waiting for someone.Thus, they had spontaneously chosen to stand beside Ling Wu and wait. Little did they expect that the person Ling Wu was waiting for a youth. What was even more unbelievable was that Ling Wu addressed this youth as a \u2018lord\u2019.Nonetheless, when everyone saw the Class 2 Creation Master crest on Lin Yuan\u2019s chest, they immediately understood. To have become a Class 2 Creation Master at such a young age meant that the youth had an influential background.After some conventional greetings, Ling Wu summoned his Platinum fey, the Scarlet Feather Fire Eagle. He then informed Lin Yuan to sit on the fey.Lin Yuan had already sat on a Platinum fey previously, so he wasn\u2019t as excited and nervous as compared to his first time sitting on a Platinum fey.This Scarlet Feather Fire Eagle was a formidable power offense-type fey, and its wings would flow with flames when it flapped the wings.The Platinum fey brought Lin Yuan to Redbud City at a very fast pace.While seated on the Scarlet Feather Fire Eagle\u2019s back, Ling Wu constantly conversed with Lin Yuan and appeared to be rather friendly.Lin Yuan understood that when City Lordess Ling Xiao sent Ling Wu to fetch him, it was actually a display of her attitude. She could have asked for Lin Yuan to travel to the Redbud City by himself, but instead, she had asked for her subordinate to fetch him.If one observed Ling Wu\u2019s reaction, they would notice he was rather respectful toward Lin Yuan. This had indirectly shown that Ling Xiao actually put a lot of importance on Lin Yuan.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t understand what sort of benefit would allow a City Lordess like Ling Xiao to treat him with such importance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When one took a glance over the city, everything looked so harmonious.It was originally a great afternoon, but all of a sudden, the sky turned gloomy. Thick clouds that were dyed with ink had started to extend their sharp claws across the clear sky. It was just like an avaricious and ruthless demon that wanted to occupy the blue sky.When the dark clouds covered the sky, it felt as though the sky had lowered significantly and gave off some pressure from above the Royal Capital.Between darkness and light, a beautiful arc split the sky into two equal parts.Everything happened within a burst of spark as the dark cloud exploded with bright electric arcs, and they looked just like slithering silver snakes. The dark marsh was actually tumbling and overflowing.Gusts of wind blew across violently and caused ripples in the lake outside of the Royal Capital. The wind also blew across the trees, causing leaves to fall and produce a magnificent sight.In the Royal Capital\u2019s Leaning Moon Mountain, inside the garden of the Radiant Moon Palace\u2026A lady in moon-colored long robes lifted her head to look at the sky, which portrayed gloominess and brightness, darkness and light, pressure and ease, heaviness and lightness, all of which complemented each other.While looking at this wonderfully fused scene, she sighed and said, \u201cDarkness clears up when encountering the morning sun, while the afternoon sun will turn dark when encountering the shades of rain.\u201dA breeze gently blew across the lady\u2019s fringe, giving her additional gentle beauty.The clash of extremities would always be nature\u2019s most charming display, and the charm could cause a shock that could cleanse the mental state.The lady lowered her head and stirred up the water jar with a lotus flower within. The lotus flower felt as though it was spiritual and was emitting fragrance when the lady was fiddling with the water.At that moment, an icy cold female voice echoed beside the lady. \u201cMoon Empress, this Sunset Jade Leaf Lotus has been nurtured by you in this garden for slightly more than two years and has already evolved to diamond-grade.\u201dThe Moon Empress lowered her head, picked up an amber bottle, and sprayed the fluid within the Sunset Jade Leaf Lotus bottle. The Sunset Jade Leaf Lotus glowed with multi-colored sunset light as though it treasured the fragrant mist produced from the amber bottle.\u201cThis Sunset Jade Leaf Lotus might have already reached diamond-grade, but the diamond-grade ability isn\u2019t a support-type ability. It is an offense-type ability,\u201d The Moon Empress\u2019 voice sounded a little regretful as she replied to the woman with the icy cold voice.\u201cCold\u00a0Moon1, bring this Sunset Jade Leaf Lotus and put it in the lotus pond behind the palace. It is a waste of the lotus fragrance and sunset colors if it is placed in this garden.\u201dCold Moon nodded, and a set of footsteps resounded. As the footsteps were getting closer, a gentle male voice echoed. \u201cMoon Empress, the information I provided to you previously belongs to that young prodigy who immediately passed the Class 2 Creation Master exam at Ling Xiao\u2019s Redbud City. I have already confirmed that all his three lifestyle-class spirit qi occupation exams did obtain full marks. Elder Ning set the questions, and they were said to be much craftier than the lifestyle-class associations.\u201dThe man\u2019s voice made the Moon Empress raise her head while her eyes were filled with bright light.\u201cCompleting the Class 2 Creation Master exam at the age of 18. Furthermore, he actually got full marks for all three lifestyle-class spirit qi occupation exams. He is truly worthy for his title as a \u2018Young Prodigy\u2019!\u201dThe man\u2019s gentle voice continued. \u201cMoon Empress, I have already informed Ling Xiao to bring that young prodigy over.\u201d\u201cYou have done well, Mystic Moon.\u201dOnce the Moon Empress finished her words, the noisy wind inside the garden suddenly stopped, and there was no more wind. It was unknown if it was a coincidental stop or whether the words stopped the wind.Mystic Moon quickly bowed. \u201cThese are things that I ought to do. There is another thing, the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association heard that the Moon Empress has the intention to accept a disciple. They have chosen and sent the number one genius among the young Creation Masters, Creation Master Tribunal Sun.\u201dBefore the Moon Empress could speak, Cold Moon\u2019s cold voice echoed first. \u201cCreation Master Tribunal Sun? A young Creation Master actually has a title? Could he be a Class 4 Creation Master at a young age?\u201dMystic Moon looked at Cold Moon and laughed lightly before replying in a gentle tone, \u201cNo matter how much of a genius a person is, Class 4 Creation Masters aren\u2019t something that the youth generation could reach. This Tribunal Sun is only a Class 2 Creation Master, but I heard that he is already qualified to progress to Class 3. Tribunal Sun is a title that is given by the Creation Master Association\u2019s three Vice Presidents. He is now 24 years old.\u201dCold Moon\u2019s face didn\u2019t change, and her voice was still as cold. \u201cTribunal Sun? The heavens have offered a tribute of the light of the sun? This title is truly majestic. Is the Tribunal Sun going to govern the entire Radiance Federation?\u201dThe Moon Empress chuckled and said, \u201cCold Moon, how can you bear to say such things? But from the looks of it, Creation Master Tribunal Sun must have been carefully nurtured by the Creation Master Association.\u201dAfter hearing the Moon Empress\u2019 words, Cold Moon pursed her lips and said, \u201cAfter learning that the Moon Empress wants to accept a disciple, the Creation Master Association has already sent over seven or eight individuals. If this Tribunal Sun is really exceptional, why didn\u2019t they send him earlier? He even has a title now? Who knows if this title is newly conferred?\u201dMystic Moon nodded. \u201cCold Moon guessed correctly. This Tribunal Sun is called Cheng Rui, and he was the first person that the Creation Master Association sent. Back then, he was rejected because Moon Empress was busy. They gave him a title and sent him again. I wonder what the Moon Empress\u2019 opinions are?\u201dThe Moon Empress shook her hand. \u201cForget it, since the Creation Master Association is sending him a second time, it wouldn\u2019t be nice for this Empress to reject again. When that young prodigy comes over, ask the Creation Master Association to send that self-titled Tribunal Sun to come along too.\u201dMystic Moon acknowledged. \u201cYes, Moon Empress. But at the same time, Dean Wang from the Creation Master Academy of the Royal Capital\u2019s Advanced Spirit Qi University has also recommended someone. This person isn\u2019t just a Creation Master. He is also Sequence #3 of the Radiance Hundred. His title is Overflowing Sea.\u201dThe Moon Empress replied, \u201cThen send him over together. Let the young prodigy see the strength of those who stand at the apex of the young generation.\u201dAfter hearing the Moon Empress\u2019 statement, Cold Moon\u2019s cold voice was suddenly filled with surprise. \u201cFor Moon Empress to consider so much for the young prodigy, is Moon Empress going to immediately accept him as your disciple? Does that mean that Mystic Moon and I will have a young lord?\u201dThe Moon Empress smiled. \u201cI will only know if I accept him after seeing him and personally testing him.\u201dThe Moon Empress might be saying this, but she recalled the information on Lin Yuan that Mystic Moon had sent over previously.The lines of words stated that he was a youth that sought survival with his younger sister.After his parents\u2019 honorable death, he had sent his younger sister to school with diligence and determination. He had done everything he could to prepare a fey for his younger sister.He always stuck to his principle when doing business and was never proud or rash. These were all character qualities that the Moon Empress admired.A person\u2019s character was actually more important than talent at times. However, she would still need to see Lin Yuan personally before it counted.As one of the Moon Empress\u2019 two Moon Envoys, Mystic Moon was going to relay the Moon Empress\u2019 message to the Creation Master Association and the Royal Capital\u2019s Advanced Spirit Qi University. However, when he left, his heart already knew he had an additional young lord.Otherwise, with the Moon Empress\u2019 temperament, she would not have divulged any biased feelings.\u201cCold Moon, follow me to the breeding room. As a mentor, my welcome gift must be appropriate.\u201dThe Moon Empress was now thinking of how the Chef Supreme and Bamboo Monarch treated their disciples as treasures.The Moon Empress felt that it was nothing.Comparing who dotes on their disciple more? Who can compare to This Empress?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It showed how massive Redbud City was.The Scarlet Feather Fire Eagle didn\u2019t land at the area where Redbud City specifically reserved for flying feys to land. Instead, it flew straight toward the city lordess residence and landed at the limestone stairs outside.\u201cLord Lin Yuan, please enter with me. Lordess Ling Xiao must have been waiting for some time.\u201dThis statement made Lin Yuan raise his brows. When Ling Wu had contacted Lin Yuan, he had already headed for the Xia Region\u2019s regional governor residence almost instantly without delay. Therefore, even if Ling Xiao had been waiting for some time, it wasn\u2019t because Lin Yuan was late. It was due to the fact that Ling Wu felt that Ling Xiao wanted to see Lin Yuan urgently.Since Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t able to think of a reason, he simply put his thoughts aside first. After all, once he saw Ling Xiao, she would probably give him an answer.After following Ling Wu into the city lordess residence\u2019s main hall, there was only Ling Xiao in there alone. Once Ling Wu informed Ling Xiao he had brought Lin Yuan here, he excused himself to deal with his other tasks.When Ling Xiao was looking at Lin Yuan, her expressionless face might not show any trace of delight, but Lin Yuan could feel happy emotions from her actions.\u201cIt must have been a tiring journey. Have a casual lunch with me, and I will bring you to the Royal Capital in the afternoon.\u201dAfter hearing the two words, \u2018Royal Capital\u2019, Lin Yuan felt as though he cleared up his previous doubts.It seems like the benefit that even Elder Ning felt envious of is in the Royal Capital.Benefits that are connected to Creation Masters in the Royal Capital and even the Class 4 Creation Master, Elder Ning, is envious. Could it be related to the three esteemed ones that are above the clouds?\u201cCity Lordess, this one isn\u2019t tired. May I know why we are going to the Royal Capital?\u201dLing Xiao hesitated for a moment and said, \u201cThe Moon Empress wishes to see you.\u201dThere were no other words.Originally, in case Lin Yuan didn\u2019t ask, Ling Xiao wasn\u2019t planning to say anything and would just bring Lin Yuan to the Moon Empress. As for the Moon Empress\u2019 plans to accept a disciple, Ling Xiao might know of it, but she wouldn\u2019t divulge it to Lin Yuan.Ling Xiao truly hoped that the Moon Empress\u2019 disciple would originate from Redbud City, and the mentioning of it might give Lin Yuan some advance notice to perform well in advance. However, Ling Xiao understood that some things could be said while some others must not.As for the Moon Empress\u2019 plans, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t dare to say too much. Staying silent was the best choice.Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t believe that he had guessed correctly. It seemed like the great benefit that Elder Ning mentioned was related to the Moon Empress.Ling Xiao sized up Lin Yuan and said, \u201cAfter the meal, go for a shower and get a change of clothes. I will ask someone to prepare clothes for you. When meeting the Moon Empress, you must not be lacking in manners.\u201dLin Yuan suddenly felt that he was being despised. He looked at the jeans that had faded after all the washing and the short-sleeved shirt before looking at Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes again. Lin Yuan was certain now that he was being despised.Ling Xiao immediately called for two individuals. They were the city lordess residence staff members, and she instructed them to bring Lin Yuan to shower and change his clothes.After some dressing up, when Ling Xiao saw Lin Yuan again, her eyes lit up. She had picked spirit qi clothes that were definitely conforming to the norms of society.The black spirit qi clothes had some dark patterns, with appropriate trims, and a matte texture. Some simple metallic decorations accompanied them. Seeing Lin Yuan in the extremely simple spirit qi clothes, even Ling Xiao involuntarily muttered, \u201cA beauty in the high places is like a jade, while a handsome young man is unmatched.\u201dThis young man wasn\u2019t just a sunshine-boy, handsome and bright, but there was even a type of composure. This was a quality and aura that Lin Yuan had been wearing but in secret. When the hidden aura was released, it really added a manly feeling to Lin Yuan.The lunch that Lin Yuan ate wasn\u2019t simple. It was a full table of eight courses, and they were only for himself and Ling Xiao. Among the dishes, most of them used ingredients from Gold feys. This meal allowed Lin Yuan to understand what it meant to be rich and imposing. This entire meal was the same as eating half a Gold fey, which cost close to 10,000 Radiance dollars.However, after consuming these delicacies, Lin Yuan had a subtle feeling that his spirit qi was constantly increasing. The food cooked with Gold spiritual ingredients actually had the effects of gradually increasing one\u2019s cultivation.Upon seeing the Lin Yuan was almost done, Ling Xiao said to the butler behind her, \u201cGo and prepare a portion of Spirit Luster Rhino\u2019s milk and make it into a double skin milk dessert for Lin Yuan.\u201dThe Spirit Luster Rhino was a Platinum fey, and it was said that its milk had great effects on strengthening the bones. To think they would actually use it to make a double skin milk dessert\u2026After eating this meal, Lin Yuan understood that one\u2019s cultivation was really the same as rolling a snowball. It was very strenuous to roll a small snowball into a large snowball. If one used too much strength in the middle, the snowball would scatter.However, when the small snowball became a large snowball, no matter how it was rolled on the ground, there wasn\u2019t a need to worry that it might scatter. But it would be hard to feel the size of the snowball getting bigger.Hence, in order to make the snowball bigger, one must not even miss out on any snow and fuse them all into the snowball. This was why high-ranked spirit qi professionals would use food nutrition to support their cultivation.Upon feeling the transformations to his spirit qi and bones, Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t help but think that he could still afford food made with Bronze spiritual ingredients. In fact, he could also afford the occasional meals that were made with Silver spiritual ingredients.Should I give Chu Ci and myself some food that is made with these spiritual ingredients?After the meal, Ling Xiao summoned her aerial fey.Lin Yuan was looking at this spirit horse that was entirely white with a blue jade-like horn. It even had a pair of giant white wings that had spots of blue gemstones. It was suave and graceful.When using True Data, Lin Yuan finally found out that this graceful horse was actually a Diamond Fantasy Breed, the Blue Jade Pegasus.After riding onto the Blue Jade Pegasus\u2019 back along with Ling Xiao, Lin Yuan never expected there would be a day where he could actually ride on a Fantasy Breed.The Blue Jade Pegasus flapped its wings and soared into the sky. The sharp horn on its head was emitting a fantasy- and jade-like blue luster. It felt like a blue field where the sun warmed the jade and produced magnificent colors.The Blue Jade Pegasus was flying at an extreme speed, and when Lin Yuan looked down, he felt that the mountains were all fuzzy images that were just like illusions.\u201cIt will take over one day to reach the Royal Capital from Redbud City when traveling on the Blue Jade Pegasus. During this period of time, you can rest up on the horse\u2019s back.\u201dLin Yuan had also nodded and agreed.\u201cCity Lordess, if even the Blue Jade Pegasus will need over a day to reach the Royal Capital, then we must be very far away from Redbud City!\u201dLin Yuan looked down at the illusory mountains and couldn\u2019t help clicking his tongue again.Previously, he had been lamenting at the speed of the Blue Jade Pegasus, and right now, he was lamenting at the distance between Redbud City and the Royal Capital. Or it should be said that he was lamenting at the size of this world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Among the 32 cities, Redbud City is situated on the central-southern side and is considered the 14th closest major city to the Royal Capital. Cold Frost City in the extreme north, Scorch Flames City in the extreme south, and Dwelling Pool City in the western Great Pool are cities that are considered far from the Royal Capital. With the Blue Jade Pegasus\u2019 speed, it will need around half a month to complete the journey.\u201dLing Xiao didn\u2019t talk much normally, but she was willing to give a thorough explanation to Lin Yuan.After listening to Ling Xiao\u2019s explanation, he felt that all the books\u2019 knowledge was just numbers. Numbers weren\u2019t as shocking as when he was seated on a Fantasy Breed fey. He could feel the speed and use time to measure the Radiance Federation\u2019s vast land.\u201cIf we traveled across water, wouldn\u2019t the time be shortened?\u201dLin Yuan realized that Ling Xiao had been instructing the Blue Jade Pegasus to travel above land. Even if they went across water regions, it would be over rivers and lakes, but not the sea region.Ling Xiao used her hand to stroke the Blue Jade Pegasus\u2019 neck and combed up its hair. However, her expression was much more serious.\u201cWhen you possess a fey that can fly across the horizon, the first lesson to learn is that you must not fly above the ocean.\u201dAfter the Spirit Qi Awakening, the ocean that allowed humans to hunt freely was now the world\u2019s most treacherous place. No matter how spacious the land was, it occupied only less than 40% of this planet. The remaining 60% was made of the ocean.The ocean was deep and immeasurable. Even in the coastal waters, there were chances of encountering wild Gold feys. A Gold fish-type fey could easily overturn a fishing boat in the sea.Occasionally, Platinum feys would also visit the coastal waters, making it very dangerous even in the coastal waters.If one was flying above the sea region and encountered a giant whale fey, they might be accidentally injured by the water pillars that the giant whale feys blasted out.After hearing the serious tone in Ling Xiao\u2019s words, Lin Yuan immediately memorized Ling Xiao\u2019s statement.He might have memorized the statement, but he still asked, \u201cNot even a Diamond/Fantasy fey?\u201dLing Xiao turned back to look at Lin Yuan with a face of approval. She didn\u2019t expect Lin Yuan to immediately recognize that this Blue Jade Pegasus was a Diamond/Fantasy fey.It wasn\u2019t hard to see that the Blue Jade Pegasus was a Fantasy Breed, but in order to let Lin Yuan have a comfortable journey, Ling Xiao had already withdrawn the Blue Jade Pegasus\u2019 imposing aura.Lin Yuan was still able to see that the Blue Jade Pegasus was a Fantasy Breed, nonetheless. This level of knowledge and experience wasn\u2019t something that a new Class 2 Creation Master would have.Ling Xiao might have given her approval, but she still sounded particularly stern.The stern words made Lin Yuan feel as though his hair was standing on end. \u201cBecause there is a possibility of Myth Breed feys appearing in the deep sea.\u201d\u201cMyth Breed?\u201d Lin Yuan asked in return.Myth Breed was something that Lin Yuan had never heard before. In fact, there wasn\u2019t any mention among the information on the Star Web.It was unknown why the words \u2018Myth Breed\u2019 gave off a magically stunning sensation.\u201cYes, Myth Breed! It is an existence that is beyond the Fantasy Breed. When a fey reaches the Legend quality and is fused with a Willpower Rune formed by the world\u2019s willpower, it will be known as a Fantasy Breed. Fantasy Breed feys are lifeforms that are already beyond the range of science. They are feys that only exist in fantasies.\u201cAs for Myth Breed, it is to gradually transform fantasies into realistic myths. Whenever a Myth Breed fey appears, it is the same as a new myth being born. Each of them possesses the power to create a myth and legend.\u201dWhen talking about the Myth Breed, Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes were filled with respect and also expectations.This conversation had opened up a door to the new world for Lin Yuan. Previously, he always thought that Fantasy Breed was the peak.Lin Yuan knew that Creation Masters could evolve feys limitlessly, but he didn\u2019t think that there was a Myth Breed above the Fantasy Breed.Ling Xiao looked at Lin Yuan\u2019s shocked expression and thought silently.\u00a0It isn\u2019t considered too early for me to say such things. If Lin Yuan became the Moon Empress\u2019 disciple, Lin Yuan would be able to make contact with a myth. Because the Moon Empress is a living myth.\u201cLin Yuan, the Myth Breed is the Radiance Federation\u2019s secret that isn\u2019t circulated in the Star Web. Therefore, you must not divulge it. Apart from that, do you know the different grades of Fantasy Breeds?\u201dLing Xiao\u2019s question was something that Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know either. However, these questions had already stimulated Lin Yuan\u2019s thirst for the unknown.\u201cThis junior doesn\u2019t know. Will the City Lordess please enlighten me?\u201dLing Xiao pointed at the Blue Jade Pegasus below and said, \u201cThis Blue Jade Pegasus is a Fantasy I fey. Fantasy Breed feys are graded by the Fantasy Five Transformations. Each transformation is taking one step closer to heaven. Five transformations will be equivalent to an ascension.\u201dLin Yuan had recorded the words, \u2018Fantasy Five Transformations\u2019 into his mind.Ling Xiao looked at Lin Yuan and suddenly said, \u201cIf possible, as you progress as a Creation Master, your combat capability should not lag behind too.\u201dWith regards to Ling Xiao\u2019s words, Lin Yuan had deep sentiments. Creation Masters were just a great option to evolve feys. It was also considered a kind of strength, but there were times when a combat-class spirit qi professional\u2019s capability was a true lifesaver.After reaching this subject, Ling Xiao and Lin Yuan didn\u2019t speak anymore.The sun was setting in the west and night was descending. The thin air in the sky was filled with cold temperatures.After October, it was already considered autumn.The bright moon suspended in the horizon, and when Lin Yuan was looking at the moon, he felt as though he could touch it. However, when he reached out, the bright moon felt as though it was infinitely far away.Lin Yuan was observing the night with the bright moon until daybreak when the sun and moon switched places.During the switch, Lin Yuan had a sudden comprehension, and a Yin-Yang Willpower Rune appeared within his mental world.Lin Yuan closed his eyes to feel the Willpower Rune that was derived from the switch between the sun and the moon.Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes were wide open. Even if Ling Xiao had lost her emotions, she still wished she could yell out,\u00a0What a goddamn prodigy!While riding on my Blue Jade Pegasus, this kid was actually able to comprehend a Willpower Rune just by looking at the sunrise.When had it been that easy to comprehend a Willpower Rune?If Ling Xiao didn\u2019t possess any Willpower Rune and if Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t so close to her, Ling Xiao wouldn\u2019t have been able to sense the formation of Lin Yuan\u2019s Willpower Rune.However, Ling Xiao didn\u2019t know that Lin Yuan didn\u2019t just have one Willpower Rune. He had a total of three Willpower Runes constantly revolving in his spiritual energy.If Ling Xiao knew, she would have wanted to kick Lin Yuan off her Blue Jade Pegasus\u2019 back.5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 88": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLing Xiao was amazed by Lin Yuan\u2019s talent as he was able to comprehend a Willpower Rune just by looking at the sunrise, and she even wanted to trample on Lin Yuan a little. However, she was circulating her spiritual power, using it to isolate the air currents in the sky.It allowed Lin Yuan to be in the most suitable environment for him to comprehend, while Ling Xiao quietly protected Lin Yuan.Ling Xiao only withdrew her spiritual power after Lin Yuan opened his eyes. She then said to Lin Yuan in a serious tone, \u201cBy comprehending a Willpower Rune, you have taken a step closer to obtaining a Fantasy Breed. But remember my words. If you wish to let your fey become a Fantasy III fey, you must not allow it to become a Fantasy Breed after evolving to the grade of Platinum.\u201dAfter hearing Ling Xiao\u2019s statement, Lin Yuan subconsciously asked, \u201cThen what about Fantasy V?\u201d\u201cI am not exactly sure on how to achieve Fantasy V, but your fey should become a Fantasy Breed during the grade of Gold. Otherwise, unless there is a huge fated opportunity, the fey would only reach Fantasy III.\u201dLin Yuan memorized Ling Xiao\u2019s explanation. Such information was truly precious for a combat-class spirit qi professional who had just comprehended a Willpower Rune.\u201cThen what if a Bronze fey\u2019s Legend quality is upgraded to Fantasy. Would there be a chance to reach Fantasy V?\u201dLing Xiao took a deep breath and fixed her eyes on Lin Yuan. \u201cDo you think the difficulty in upgrading a Bronze fey into a Fantasy Breed is the same as to upgrade a Gold fey into a Fantasy Breed? To upgrade Bronze feys to the Legend quality is more than 100 times harder than to upgrade Gold feys to the Legend quality. Even if a Class 4 Creation Master did their best, they might not be able to achieve it. In addition, do you think Willpower Runes are that easy to comprehend?\u201cEven among the young generation\u2019s Radiance Hundred, not everyone possesses a Fantasy Breed. Most of their feys are either stuck at the Legend quality, or they do not have any Willpower Runes.\u201dIt was true. After becoming a Sequence member of the Radiance Hundred, one could enjoy the Radiance Federation\u2019s resources and also access to Creation Masters.Even if a Gold fey\u2019s quality couldn\u2019t reach Legend, it shouldn\u2019t be a problem to reach the Legend quality at platinum-grade.As for Willpower Runes, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t feel any difficulty at all. His three Willpower Runes had come smoothly and naturally without obstructions, just like how he drank water.Ling Xiao\u2019s words also reminded Lin Yuan something. Subconsciously, Lin Yuan had thought that the difficulty in upgrading a fey to the Legend quality was the same from Bronze and above.Be it Bronze, Silver, or Gold, as long as the spirit qi reached a certain point, all feys\u2019 quality could reach Legend with the correct combination of spiritual ingredients.However, Lin Yuan realized he had thought it wrongly. Such situations were only suitable for him and not for other Creation Masters.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have to worry about feys not being able to reach the Legend quality, but he didn\u2019t have any idea on how to upgrade his source-type lifeform, Red Thorn. Red Thorn\u2019s progress was considered the greatest challenge that Lin Yuan faced so far. Even now, Lin Yuan still didn\u2019t have any solution.After one entire day of flight, Lin Yuan was already able to see the Royal Capital\u2019s outline under the rising sun. The grand Royal Capital was truly spectacular, and it made Lin Yuan feel like he was on a heroic journey.\u00a0Royal Capital, I, Lin Yuan, am here!\u2026\u201cOh? Isn\u2019t this Lord Overflowing Sea, the Radiance Hundred\u2019s Sequence #3? The Radiance Hundred should currently be participating in the tribulation missions. Why is Lord Overflowing Sea here at the Leaning Moon Mountain?\u201d The one speaking was a youth with thin lips.The youth might have a genuine smile while speaking, and his actions were passionate too, but they were still unable to cover the feeling of pretense.Cheng Rui looked at Long Tao, who stood beside him, with arrogance. He was Sequence #3 of the Radiance Hundred and also known as Overflowing Sea. It gave Cheng Rui a pressure that was several times heavier.Long Tao might be Sequence #3 of the Radiance Hundred, a formidable combat-class spirit qi professional to boot, but he was also an extremely talented Creation Master.Cheng Rui\u2019s combat capability wasn\u2019t comparable to Long Tao, but in terms of Creation Master talent, Cheng Rui was certain that he was better even though they had yet to compete.After all, he was known as the best Creation Master among the young generation and already had the title of Tribunal Sun as a Class 2 Creation Master.Long Tao didn\u2019t even look at Cheng Rui. Instead, he looked at the elder standing behind Cheng Rui as he said, \u201cIf you aren\u2019t genuinely calling me as Lord Overflowing Sea, then don\u2019t. I have never liked such pretentious behaviors. To have a title as a Class 2 Creation Master\u2026 Our ages are similar, but why didn\u2019t the Creation Master Association give me, Long Tao, a title too?\u201dLong Tao\u2019s words weren\u2019t just targeting Cheng Rui, but also the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association that backed Cheng Rui.As for the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association\u2019s action, it didn\u2019t just dissatisfy Long Tao, but it had also dissatisfied the Creation Master Academy of the Royal Capital Advanced Spirit Qi University.Even if one\u2019s potential was great, they would naturally receive a title with honor when the individual reached that status. But to receive a title at Class 2 and openly declare that Cheng Rui was the No.1 Creation Master among the young generation, it would certainly cause dissatisfaction among all the extremely talented youths.Cheng Rui\u2019s face was turning white and green while the elder standing behind Cheng Rui quickly responded, \u201cLittle Long, you are being too much with your words. Cheng Rui is indeed capable enough to receive this title.\u201dThis elder behind Cheng Rui was the Vice President of the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association, and he was famed for a very long time.Long Tao\u2019s words might be criticizing and overbearing, but with his status as Sequence #3 of the Radiance Hundred, the elder didn\u2019t dare to berate him. In addition, standing beside Long Tao was the Dean of the Creation Master Academy of the Royal Capital Advanced Spirit Qi University.The Royal Capital Advanced Spirit Qi University\u2019s Creation Master Academy had always been competing with the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association. If the elder from the Creation Master Association were to say more, the old rival would have joined the battlefield.Long Tao still had the same expression and didn\u2019t look at Cheng Rui. \u201cA few days ago, I successfully passed the Class 3 Creation Master exam at the Creation Master Association in Ascending Dragon City. If Cheng Rui is capable enough for this title, I wonder if I can also receive my title from the Creation Master Association in advance? However, even if the Creation Master Association wishes to give me a title, I will not accept it. Once I become a Class 4 Creation Master, I will naturally seize the title that belongs to me.\u201dLong Tao\u2019s words were like slaps after slaps. There was nothing wrong with his words, but they were slaps that ruthlessly smacked on Cheng Rui\u2019s face. His words had also caused the Vice President of the Creation Master Association to turn gloomy.However, Long Tao\u2019s words weren\u2019t wrong at all.Had it not been for the Moon Empress accepting a disciple, even if Cheng Rui was talented, he wouldn\u2019t have obtained a title as a Class 2 Creation Master. The conferring of a title was to elevate Cheng Rui\u2019s status as the No.1 Young Creation Master.But now that Long Tao was already a Class 3 Creation Master, even if Cheng Rui also had a Class 3 Creation Master\u2019s potential, he still wasn\u2019t one yet.As the Vice President of the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association, he no longer had as much confidence in Cheng Rui as before. However, he thought for a moment and felt that it should be the Moon Empress who would make the decision in the end. The Moon Empress would take just a split moment to make her choice, and it didn\u2019t mean that Cheng Rui didn\u2019t have a chance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89: An Important PersonThe dean of the Royal Capital Advanced Spirit Qi University\u2019s Creation Master Academy stood there while twirling two jade spheres in his hand. He looked at the Creation Master Association\u2019s Vice President and said, \u201cOld thing, right now, even the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association is inferior to our academy when nurturing Creation Masters. Therefore, the No.1 young Creation Master of this generation isn\u2019t from your association. He is from our academy!\u201dAfter criticizing, the elder with the jade spheres laughed heartily. It was a burst of very forthright laughter, and it was genuinely from the bottom of his heart.However, it was also this laughter and angered the Vice President of the Creation Master Association so much that his body was shaking gently. He was obviously quite enraged.\u201cYou old thing, what is there worth being happy for?! In the end, Long Tao is registered as a Class 3 Creation Master under our Ascending Dragon City\u2019s Creation Master Association. He is still considered a member of our Creation Master Association.\u201dThe Dean from the Creation Master Academy had stopped twirling the jade spheres too and said in a flabbergasted tone, \u201cYou idiotic old man are too shameless! How can you even say something like that!? Shouldn\u2019t you ask if the Ascending Dragon City\u2019s Creation Master Association admits if they are on the same side with your Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association? If you can say it like that, then I can also say that all the students in the federation are students from our academy!\u201dCreation Master Associations between cities had a competing relationship as they would strive for more resources for their city\u2019s Creation Masters. When a Creation Master participated in the city\u2019s Creation Master Association exam, they would be recorded as the city\u2019s Creation Master.The Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association might be in the Royal Capital and was just like a headquarters for all the Creation Master Associations, but the truth wasn\u2019t so. Instead of saying they were the headquarters, it was better to say that they were the top rival for each Creation Master Associations.The two elders started a dispute as soon as they met under the Leaning Moon Mountain. It made Cheng Rui and Long Tao rather embarrassed.Cheng Rui didn\u2019t dare to mention that he was the No.1 young Creation Master in front of Long Tao. In fact, he was no longer proud of his title like before and actually felt rather ashamed.However, Long Tao was obviously not planning to let go of Cheng Rui. \u201cI have watched your interview on the Star Web. You don\u2019t look the same as you do in real life as compared to the Star Web. On the Star Web, you look as though you are really the leader of the young generation!\u201dLong Tao might be speaking indifferently, but this statement was more like a heavy punch as compared to the slaps earlier. Cheng Rui was so agitated that his expression turned from green to red.\u201cLong Tao! You are too much! You are one year older than me. One year later, I will definitely become a Class 3 Creation Master too! Your Creation Master talent might not be better than mine! I am just one year younger, that\u2019s all.\u201dInstead of looking at his weakness, he found an excuse.\u00a0Just by this attitude, Long Tao felt that Cheng Rui was a weakling.Long Tao believed that after he entered the Radiance Hundred Sequence, all of the competitors he faced were all senior to him. The eldest would be ten years older than him, as a Sequence member could remain in the Radiance Hundred for ten years.Long Tao had been on a path of obstacles and used four years to reach his position as Sequence #3, while his Creation Master\u2019s progress didn\u2019t get delayed either. This was because Long Tao had never found an excuse for himself to fail. He confronted failure, analyzed failure, and treasured failure. He treasured failure because the number of failures was getting increasingly low and close to zero.Cheng Rui\u2019s attitude was something that Long Tao despised.\u201cYou are not thinking to say that the river that flows to the east for thirty years will flow to the west for the next thirty years, so I shouldn\u2019t bully you just because you are young, right?\u201dCheng Rui did want to say these words, but they were exposed by Long Tao first. At that moment, Cheng Rui understood that he wasn\u2019t going to be a match for Long Tao in terms of words. The more he said would just be seeking more trouble for himself.Cheng Rui had never met with Long Tao before this. In the matches, Long Tao always had the dominant and aggressive style, while his interviews were seldom as conversational. Cheng Rui didn\u2019t expect Long Tao to be such foul-mouthed, and his words to be truly infuriating.There was a gentle and clear voice that echoed throughout Leaning Moon Mountain.\u201cI am here on the Moon Empress\u2019 orders to receive Elder Du and Elder Meng.\u201dThe gentle voice caused Long Tao to narrow his eyes. The voice felt as though it was right beside him, but there was no one to be found. After a period of time, Long Tao still couldn\u2019t find the source of the voice.Elder Du, the Vice President of the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association, and Elder Meng, the Dean of the Royal Capital Advanced Spirit Qi University\u2019s Creation Master Academy, suddenly spoke loudly toward the air. \u201cWe have troubled Envoy Mystic Moon.\u201dOnce Elder Meng and Elder Du responded, a man with long silver robes suddenly appeared in the passageway leading to the Leaning Moon Mountain. The man was walking over unhurriedly, but in less than two steps with ease, he had traveled across dozens of meters and arrived in their vicinity.\u201cElder Du and Elder Meng still look so brilliant. However, we cannot ascend the mountain yet as we still need to wait for an important person to arrive.\u201d Mystic Moon turned silent after speaking.Elder Du and Elder Meng looked at each other and could see the astonishment in each other\u2019s eyes.Mystic Moon was a king-class expert, and he was already at the pinnacle of king-class. His contracted feys were all mainly spiritual-type, and he might be a support-class spirit qi professional, but any of the same class experts would say that the most troublesome foe they faced were spirit qi professionals with spiritual-type feys.Putting aside Mystic Moon\u2019s strength, just his status as one of the Moon Empress\u2019 two Moon Envoys, he represented the will of the Moon Empress wherever he went.Mystic Moon might look gentle, but his way of doing things was abnormally tyrannical. He was just like a razor-sharp thread hidden in the snow\u2014there was no shadow or form. But once someone made contact, they would be severed into pieces.Mystic Moon might not be as emotionless as Cold Moon when dealing with matters, but he was abnormally arrogant.We are supposed to wait for an important person here?The words \u2018important person\u2019 stated that this person should be rather familiar with the Moon Empress and could already be considered one of her own. Otherwise, the words would be an important guest and not an important person.For Mystic Moon to mention the word important, it was easy to imagine the status of that person.Elder Du and Elder Meng pulled Cheng Rui and Long Tao to the side.Even Long Tao, who was Sequence #3 of the Radiance Hundred, had also withdrawn his aura and was abnormally obedient.At that moment, a snow-white figure with a blue jade horn flew over from far away. A pegasus with wings glistening with a blue jade-like texture was flying toward the Leaning Moon Mountain.The gentle and expressionless Mystic Moon put on a smile.The Blue Jade Pegasus finally landed.Ling Xiao led Lin Yuan and leaped off the pegasus.Elder Du and Elder Meng took a glance at Ling Xiao and immediately averted their gaze before fixing their eyes on Lin Yuan.Lin Yuan\u2019s hair was rather messy due to the wind, but when he was standing under the sunlight, he gave off an indescribable aura that lit up the eyes of Elder Du and Elder Meng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even as the City Lordess of Redbud City, it still wasn\u2019t enough for Mystic Moon to use the word important. Therefore, the important person mentioned by Mystic Moon could only be this youth standing beside Ling Xiao.Lin Yuan could obviously feel five pairs of eyes staring at him apart from Ling Xiao right now. While feeling the gazes, he didn\u2019t know any of these people. However, due to respect, he still nodded in response as a greeting.Ling Xiao originally wanted to make an introduction, but Mystic Moon\u2019s gentle and clear voice echoed. \u201cEveryone is here. Follow me to the Leaning Moon Mountain. Lin Yuan, come beside me. We shall walk together.\u201dLin Yuan had already noticed the silver-robed man that spoke. The silver-robed man\u2019s aura was like a torrential undercurrent underneath the deep sea with no signs of ripples on the surface.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect this silver-robed man to actually know him. He looked toward Ling Xiao and saw her make a gulping motion but didn\u2019t say a word. She merely nodded to Lin Yuan.As such, Lin Yuan walked beside Mystic Moon in a relaxed manner. Mystic Moon let out a bright smile and led Lin Yuan up the mountain.Ling Xiao walked together with Elder Meng and Elder Du, while Long Tao and Cheng Rui walked by the side. The five of them followed behind Ling Xiao and Mystic Moon.At that moment, Elder Du and Elder Meng looked at Ling Xiao. She gave Elder Du and Elder Meng an expressionless greeting while saying, \u201cIt is what Elder Du and Elder Meng are thinking.\u201dElder Meng and Elder Du looked at Lin Yuan with rather complicated eyes. They had a feeling that this youth that made their eyes light up was actually here to harvest the peach. Moreover, from Mystic Moon\u2019s actions, could this Lin Yuan be the person that the Moon Empress had already decided to accept?Long Tao looked at Lin Yuan with probing eyes. Cheng Rui was looking at Lin Yuan with eyes of jealousy and complication.After a few questions from Elder Du and Elder Meng, the rest of the people knew of Lin Yuan\u2019s identity. He was the one that had directly passed the Class 2 Creation Master exam in Redbud City.The Creation Master Association\u2019s reformation started off with Redbud City and was now conducted over the Radiance Federation\u2019s 32 cities. What was the implication of the reformation? Elder Du and Elder Meng understood, but they never expected someone to actually meet such harsh requirements. In addition, this person arrived so quickly!Long Tao was rather calm on appearance, but Cheng Rui\u2019s face was filled with obvious reluctance to accept this outcome. Cheng Rui gritted his teeth and thought,\u00a0He is just a kid that passed the Class 2 Creation Master exam. What is so great about that? He might have been lucky at that time. I am already almost capable enough to take the Class 3 Creation Master exam. To crush this kid, wouldn\u2019t it be as easy as playing with toys?Long Tao looked at Cheng Rui\u2019s expression and burst out with a laugh. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you compare yourself with him and see how much younger he is than you?\u201dCheng Rui\u2019s expression was always rich, and especially after being criticized by Long Tao, he looked as though he had eaten 30 lemons followed by 30 bitter gourds.One had to admit that the Leaning Moon Mountain was filled with beautiful sceneries. Lin Yuan activated True Data along the way, and apart from his conversation with Mystic Moon, he saw plenty of Gold feys and even some Platinum feys.These feys were mostly plant-type ones, with the occasional butterflies, dragonflies, bees, and small avians. The rare feys that were hard to see in the outside world could be seen everywhere in the Leaning Moon Mountain.At that moment, Mystic Moon said, \u201cWe will be reaching the Radiant Moon Palace in a few more steps.\u201dMystic Moon\u2019s words weren\u2019t just for Lin Yuan, but they were also for the people behind them.After passing through a gallery of mountains, Lin Yuan saw a palace that looked as though it was constructed with fluorite. The palace\u2019s main body was white like white jade, but it was emitting sparkling light like the moon in the sky.There were two straight trees in front of the palace that were close to ten meters in height. The trees were blooming with delicate flowers that were a fusion of gold and silver. The flowers were so dense that it made the branches hang downward.These two trees were actually Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassias!When looking at the True Data, Lin Yuan felt he was going to fall over. These two Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassias were actually Diamond X. Of course, that wasn\u2019t important. The crucial point was that their quality was Legend.Such precious species were planted at the palace entrance without anyone contracting them, and they were only used as a part of the scenery. This was something that Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t imagine.When Mystic Moon saw Lin Yuan look at the two Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassias, he took the initiative to introduce, \u201cThe two cassias are rather good-looking and have been planted here. The Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia is rather special, but it doesn\u2019t have any fragrance. However, the flowers can be used to make osmanthus honey. Cold Moon is great at making osmanthus honey. I will ask Cold Moon to prepare one bowl for you later.\u201dFeys like the Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia were actually beyond Lin Yuan\u2019s knowledge. He could only know of its name through True Data. Lin Yuan might not be sure, but Ling Xiao, Elder Du, and Elder Meng knew what they were.After hearing that Mystic Moon was going to casually give a bowl of osmanthus honey to Lin Yuan, even the three authority experts wanted to try and ask for a portion, even if it was just a few drops.The Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia\u2019 nectar was great for eliminating impurities. Normally, others would dissolve one drop into a cup and dilute it several times for consumption.If Lin Yuan were to drink an entire bowl of Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar, it was probable that all of his body\u2019s impurities would be cleansed.The world only had two Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassias, and they were in the hands of the Moon Empress but were planted in front of the Radiant Moon Palace.The Moon Empress might harvest ten drops of nectar for the Royal Capital Advanced Spirit Qi University and the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association, but even if they accumulated for a few dozen years, they still couldn\u2019t gather a bowl.\u201cMystic Moon, the osmanthus honey is brewed by me, and you actually want to give it to others. Even if it is a gift, it should be from me.\u201dThe voice sounded limpid like the ice water in the icy pool.Lin Yuan looked at the lady and noticed a blue-robed lady looking at him.Mystic Moon let out a bright smile. \u201cAlright, Cold Moon, bring them to see the Moon Empress. I still have other tasks given by the Moon Empress.\u201dCold Moon nodded and said to everyone, \u201cFollow me into the Radiant Moon Palace.\u201dAfter entering the Radiant Moon Palace, Lin Yuan felt that every spot in the palace was emitting grace. There was a platform with a table at the front and two boxes.Cold Moon pulled Lin Yuan to her side and said to Elder Meng and Elder Du, \u201cThe Moon Empress has placed a treasure in each of the boxes. Both parties can allow your young talents to pick one of the boxes. The treasure within the box shall be considered a gift from the Moon Empress.\u201dCold Moon\u2019s words made Elder Du and Elder Meng\u2019s eyes light up. But at the same time, they didn\u2019t understand why there were only two brocade boxes while there were three young talents?Lin Yuan stood beside Cold Moon and watched indifferently. He might not know what was happening, but he knew it wasn\u2019t simple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91: Apex Battle Between the Youth GenerationsAfter Long Tao and Cheng Rui received instructions from their elders, they stepped forward and walked toward the platform.As soon as they stood on the platform, one of the four female attendants that stood in the four corners of the palace hall stepped forward as well. The attendant arrived on the platform with a flash.The female attendant looked around 30 years old, but she gave off a tender and delicate feeling.\u201cI am one of the Radiant Moon Palace\u2019s tea attendants. My name is Cai Cha, and I am here to inform you that the treasure in the golden box is superior to the one in the gray box.\u201d After speaking, she bowed to Cold Moon. Once Cold Moon nodded, Cai Cha withdrew to the platform\u2019s side instead of the corner of the palace hall.The platform had two boxes, one was gold, and the other was gray. Lin Yuan immediately saw Long Tao and Cheng Rui\u2019s hands reaching toward the gold box.At that moment, Long Tao\u2019s spirit qi burst out and caused Cheng Rui to take a few steps back, allowing Long Tao to open the gold brocade box.Once the gold box was opened, Lin Yuan could smell a refreshingly sweet smell. There was a light purple pearl within the box, and it was the size of a thumb.It might be a light purple pearl, but it was emitting a mild purple light. The refreshingly sweet smell felt like it didn\u2019t come from the pearl itself but from the mild light.Next to the light purple pearl was an exquisite wooden token, and apart from these two things, there was nothing else.Cai Cha, who was standing at the side, said, \u201cThis treasure is a pearl produced by the Diamond Purple Coral Shellfish. It is greatly beneficial for water-type feys, and there is a chance to help a water-type fey evolve.\u201dCai Cha\u2019s words caused Long Tao\u2019s indifferent face to turn grave, and his breaths were heavier. His eyes were filled with extreme delight.Lin Yuan looked at the light purple pearl, and involuntarily clicked his tongue. This wasn\u2019t just a Diamond spiritual ingredient, but it was also a Diamond spiritual ingredient from the deep sea. Shellfish feys had another name\u2014deep-sea treasure. It was because shellfish feys could produce pearls and only formidable individuals were qualified to explore the deep sea.Just because of the danger level, the pearl produced by the Purple Coral Shellfish was considered a priceless treasure, let alone the astonishing effects of the Purple Coral Shellfish\u2019s pearl.Lin Yuan wasn\u2019t able to estimate the price of the Purple Coral Shellfish\u2019s pearl. However, just by looking at Ling Xiao\u2019s envious eyes, he knew that the Purple Coral Shellfish\u2019s pearl was very rare.Long Tao held the Purple Coral Shellfish\u2019s pearl in his hand and picked up the wooden token beside the pearl. The wooden token was carved with a small sword.Cai Cha continued talking. \u201cThe wooden token is carved with a small sword and is the Radiant Moon Palace\u2019s sword tablet. You can carry out a contest with those who possess a sword token. The sword token possessor would have strength that is equivalent to yours. If you win, you can use this sword token to exchange for another treasure. It is fine if you lose too as it is only a contest.\u201dLong Tao turned around to look at Elder Meng and saw the latter nodding at him. Long Tao then asked Cai Cha, \u201cI wonder if the contest is referring to a contest between combat-class spirit qi professionals or between Creation Masters?\u201dCai Cha smiled and said, \u201cSince it is a sword token, it is naturally a contest between combat-class spirit qi professionals. If the token is carved with a tool, then it is a contest between Creation Masters.\u201dLong Tao gripped the token in his hand and said loudly, \u201cI am willing to accept the contest.\u201dSince Long Tao took the Purple Coral Shellfish\u2019s pearl, Cheng Rui was looking at Long Tao with such gloomy eyes that a tear might drip out. However, no one was paying any attention to Cheng Rui\u2019s expressions as all the attention was gathered on Long Tao, especially Lin Yuan, who didn\u2019t think that he would actually be able to see a match fought by Sequence #3 of the Radiance Hundred.After watching this match, Lin Yuan would be able to understand the standard of combat strength for Sequence members at the top of the Radiance Hundred.Lin Yuan had watched the match between the White Devil and the Unknown Flame. At the end of the battle, White Devil\u2019s Revival Swallowtail Butterfly had been released from the cage and transformed into a Disaster Swallowtail Butterfly. It had allowed the White Devil to end the battle with overwhelming dominance.In addition, White Devil might be Sequence #18 of the Radiance Hundred, but she was a healing-type spirit qi professional, and she was more proficient in tactics rather than actual combat.However, Long Tao was Sequence #3 of the Radiance Hundred and had the Overflowing Sea title. He was a true combat-class spirit qi professional.Cai Cha waved the sword token in her hand, and all the female attendants with similar attire came out of the palace hall\u2019s corner and stood on the platform.Lin Yuan looked over and noticed that all four female attendants actually looked exactly the same. The only difference would be the hair accessories on their heads.Cold Moon looked at Lin Yuan\u2019s reaction and gave an explanation. \u201cCai Cha, Xi Cha, Peng Cha, and Yin Cha[1] are the Radiant Moon Palace\u2019s tea attendants. They are quadruplets, and the Moon Empress found them when they were babies 30 years ago. They have been serving the Radiant Moon Palace ever since.\u201dLin Yuan nodded. However, he didn\u2019t understand why Cold Moon would give him such a detailed explanation of the Radiant Moon Palace\u2019s members, as though he would need to know them later on.\u201cAll four of us share this sword token. I am the strongest among all of us, while the three of them have similar strength. You can choose any of us as your opponent,\u201d Cai Cha said to Long Tao.Long Tao didn\u2019t have any trace of hesitation as he chose Cai Cha, who was speaking and also the strongest.After seeing this scene, Lin Yuan felt that Cai Cha\u2019s thoughts weren\u2019t simple as her simple statement was actually an open conspiracy.Cai Cha might have stated who was strong and weak, but in this situation and with Long Tao\u2019s temperament and pride, he would definitely pick the strongest among the four.When Elder Meng saw that Long Tao and Cai Cha adopted their fighting postures, Elder Meng quickly asked Cold Moon, who was standing beside Lin Yuan, \u201cEnvoy Cold Moon, would a fight in the Radiant Moon Palace cause damage to the items here? What if Long Tao doesn\u2019t reserve himself and severely injures the tea attendant?\u201dThis wasn\u2019t Elder Meng\u2019s first time at the Radiant Moon Palace, and he naturally knew about the four tea attendants. Every time he visited the Moon Empress, he would be able to drink the spirit tea brewed by the four tea attendants. However, Elder Meng had never heard that the four weak-looking tea attendants could actually fight.Cold Moon responded with a cold voice, \u201cThe palace hall is constantly supported with the ability, Harden of a Fantasy V, Resolute Diamond Resplendent Tortoise. If a junior could easily destroy it, then the Radiant Moon Palace would have been destroyed a long time ago. As for the contest, it was specified by the Moon Empress.\u201dAfter Cold Moon finished speaking, she circulated the spiritual power within her body and enveloped herself and Lin Yuan in a qi barrier.Since Cold Moon had already said so, Elder Meng naturally didn\u2019t dare to go against the Moon Empress\u2019 intention.Elder Du pulled Cheng Rui over and reserved the space for Long Tao and Cai Cha.Lin Yuan heard Cold Moon\u2019s words clearly. She wasn\u2019t polite at all when speaking with Elder Meng. Since the Moon Empress had specified it, Elder Meng didn\u2019t even dare to make an additional statement.Elder Meng was the Dean of the Creation Master Academy in the Royal Capital Advanced Spirit Qi University. But he didn\u2019t dare to showcase any of the authority he possessed in the Royal Capital.After thanking Cold Moon for using her qi to protect him, Lin Yuan put all his attention into this apex battle between the youths.[1] These four sisters have names that are related to tea.

    "Chapter 92": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yuan noticed that Cai Cha and Long Tao were both circulating their spirit qi.Long Tao summoned a shark-like fey that was around two to three meters long but had dragon patterns on its body.Using True Data, Lin Yuan recognized that this was a Platinum VI/Epic Reef Sturgeon.As for Cai Cha, there was a tea tree that bloomed with white camellia.Lin Yuan took a glance and noticed that both the feys were Platinum ones, but Cai Cha\u2019s fey was a Fantasy Breed. Furthermore, the tea tree was a Fantasy II.Cai Cha commanded the tea tree, \u201cDark Dream Fragrant Tea, Tool Transformation!\u201dAfter receiving Cai Cha\u2019s command, Lin Yuan watched as the Platinum/Fantasy II tea tree turned into a five-string pipa and landed in Cai Cha\u2019s hands.Cai Cha used her delicate hands to strum the strings. The large strings were clamoring, while the small strings were distinctive.The sounds of the strings were like an army of thousands of troops and horses. They broke through the air and blasted at Long Tao.Long Tao quickly jumped onto the Reef Sturgeon\u2019s back, but the sound of strings sliced it. Bone-deep wounds appeared on the Reef Sturgeon. The Reef Sturgeon was in so much pain that it let out a roar.Long Tao\u2019s eyes immediately turned sharp and serious. By experiencing the burst of sound damage, Long Tao knew that this woman might look weak, but she was dangerous.Cai Cha let out a gentle smile and continued to strum the pipa.Long Tao quickly commanded the Reef Sturgeon to bring up a wave to block the string sounds\u2019 damage. At the same time, Long Tao circulated his spiritual power again, and two figures appeared. One was blue, and the other red, and they were half a meter in size.The blue and red feys were actually two Deep Blue Dragon Jellyfish.The Deep Blue Dragon Jellyfish might possess dragon-species bloodline, but they weren\u2019t considered dragon-species feys. These two Deep Blue Dragon Jellyfish were actually two Deep Blue Jellyfish that were nurtured from young with dragon blood. When they turned into Fantasy Breed feys, they would undergo a transformation.The two different-colored Deep Blue Dragon Jellyfish were Platinum/Fantasy I. When Long Tao summoned the two Fantasy I feys, an immediate downpour of rain followed.The rain formed lines, which were filled with the grim and murderous intent of the deep sea. The raindrops were sharp like needles and felt as though they could pierce through all life that they came in contact with.When enveloped by the murderous intent, Lin Yuan only saw Cai Cha changing her stance. She raised the pipa over her shoulder and strummed it. The string sounds formed a barrier around Cai Cha, which bloomed with camellias. They rapidly restored the spirit qi within Cai Cha\u2019s body.Cai Cha\u2019s eyes turned stern as she formed a claw and grabbed the strings before forcefully twirling them. The mild and reserved string sound was scattered out with a flick of her fingers.The string sound carried an unstoppable force and broke through the boundary formed by the heavy rain. It then smashed into the two Deep Blue Dragon Jellyfish and the Reef Sturgeon.The two Deep Blue Dragon Jellyfish and Reef Sturgeon had created a water boundary, but it was still smashed open by the unstoppable and murderous string sound. It caused minor injuries to the two Deep Blue Dragon Jellyfish. The Reef Sturgeon also received severe injuries and lost its ability to fight.Cai Cha turned the pipa around and sat on the back of it while she smiled and said, \u201cRadiance Hundred Sequence #3. You might be known as the Overflowing Sea, but you are also known as the Son of Dragon. Your contracted feys are mostly dragon-species ones. But if you don\u2019t use your trump card in this battle, then you will never be able to obtain the sword token and redeem another treasure.\u201dLong Tao\u2019s aura suddenly changed, and his violent spirit qi suddenly burst to the peak.A massive figure appeared behind Long Tao while he said, \u201cIf this is your only capability, then I shall be taking the sword token for sure. As Sequence #3, I naturally have the strength to protect my spot as Sequence #3!\u201dOnce Long Tao finished talking, the massive figure behind him finally revealed its full appearance. It was a giant sea dragon that was close to 30 meters in length. It was the size of those prehistoric sea dinosaurs, and it was rather similar to a Tylosaurus.When Lin Yuan was looking at this dragon-species fey, he felt his blood was boiling. This was the dragon-species fey that had allowed Long Tao to rise up to fame and also the reason for his title, Overflowing Sea.Lin Yuan had read about the information on the Radiance Hundred on the Star Web previously, but now that he saw this massive fey\u2019s full appearance, he felt as though he was looking at a scene of the prehistoric times.Lin Yuan used True Data to check on this sea dragon fey\u2019s name.[Fey Name]: Sea King Cretaceous Dragon[Fey Species]: Mosasaurus species/Emperor Dragon genus[Spirit-Lifeform Grade]: Platinum (10/10)[Fey Type]: Water[Fey Quality]: Fantasy IIIAbilities:[Whirl Flow]: Stir up the water region and cause extreme suction flow in the water.[Eight Dragon Shadows]: The dragon shadow moves and transforms into eight dragon shadows. Each dragon shadow possesses 60% of the original body\u2019s attributes.[Sea Bite]: Control the flow of the sea to form a bite. The biting force is equivalent to the biting force of the original body.[Sea Emperor\u2019s Dragon Breath]: Shoot out a destructive breath that belongs to the emperor dragons.[Wrath of the Ocean]: Utilize all of the innate energy within the ocean to conduct a devastating tremor. The extreme tremor within the water has the power to destroy everything within the sea region.Exclusive Skill:[Water Overseer]: Delicate control when using the power of water and can control the flow of water.[Extremity of Sea]: Gather water elements and form rivers. Allow the rivers to flow into the sea and control a portion of the sea region.Sea King Cretaceous Dragon\u2026 What kind of name was this? Having the title of Sea King meant that it ruled during the Cretaceous period. It was indeed worthy of being the most respected Emperor Dragon genus among the dragon-species feys!Cold Moon looked at Lin Yuan and nodded with satisfaction when she noticed that he was carefully observing the match.Once the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon appeared, it let out a deafening roar. Water elements from the surrounding rapidly gathered and formed a massive sea region.Cai Cha strummed the pipa swiftly and opened up a boundary within the sea region so as not to be engulfed by the seawater.However, a whirlpool formed within the sea region. The originally unpredictable whirlpool was like a pair of devil\u2019s hands at the bottom of the sea\u2014it pulled everything at the water\u2019s surface back into the bottom of the sea.Lin Yuan\u2019s pupils contracted as the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon\u2019s attack was a flawless combination of the exclusive skills, Water Overseer, Extremity of Sea, and the ability, Whirl Flow.It took just a split moment to control the state of battle. Cai Cha\u2019s forehead perspired a little as she was already exhausted from dealing with the suction flow. Cai Cha thought to herself,\u00a0If this carries on, I will lose my ability to resist and will be engulfed by the seawater.Cai Cha circulated her spirit qi, and a small black beast immediately appeared within her self-created boundary.It was a small deer without horns and had big eyes. The moment it appeared, it spat out a bundle of white mist. When the white mist reached Cai Cha\u2019s fingertips, they fused into the pipa through her fingers.Cai Cha then strummed the pipa thrice, sending out a pipa sound that felt like it could explode a silver bottle.At this moment, Long Tao yelled out, \u201cWhite, use Sea Bite!\u201dIn an instant, the water around Cai Cha looked as though it turned into sharp fangs. With the biting force of the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon, which was at least 10,000 tons, it bit down at the boundary that Cai Cha created.1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93: The Result is EvidentWater was always this world\u2019s softest thing, however, when the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon activated the Sea Bite ability, sharp fangs formed with seawater appeared outside of the boundary Cai Cha had created.The sharp claw might be formless, but the stirred up water flow allowed for a rough view of the fangs\u2019 shape.The size of the fangs was almost the same as the mouth of the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon. The intense pressure caused an ear-piercing boom as though metal plates were clashing.At the crucial moment, Cai Cha quickly scattered the white mist produced by the small black deer that was fused into the pipa strings and fused it into the strings by the neck, causing it to suddenly tighten.The devastating pressure from the sharp fangs nearly deformed Cai Cha\u2019s boundary.Lin Yuan was obviously able to see seawater leaking into Cai Cha\u2019s boundary. There were clear bite marks on the boundary, and the seawater was seeping inside from the bitemarks.However, as Cai Cha was using all her strength to strum, the boundary was able to withstand the pressure and rapidly mend the cracks.Lin Yuan was astonished. The Sea Bite ability was truly a divine ability within the water region. If the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon wanted to rip its prey, it didn\u2019t even need to fight at close range. Any place in the water region with a flow of water could be turned into the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon\u2019s sharp fangs.The Sea Bite ability could be executed formlessly, and the enemy could only endure the attack. In addition, the strength of the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon\u2019s bite didn\u2019t come from the pressure\u2014it was the penetrative power of the sharp fangs. It was the sharp fangs that made an opening in Cai Cha\u2019s boundary.Long Tao stood on the back of the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon and said to Cai Cha, \u201cShall we end it here? Your boundary is already broken, and I am not adept at controlling my power in combat.\u201dLong Tao didn\u2019t try to cover the meaning in his words and immediately stated that he had already controlled his attack power earlier and didn\u2019t wish to injure Cai Cha.Cai Cha\u2019s face turned grave in response, but she smiled and said, \u201cIt is rather boring to settle the match like this. You might not be adept at controlling your power, but I am.\u201dAfter speaking, that small black deer lit up with a luster was like the dark night. It quickly swallowed all of the visible light in the sea region before letting out a clear cry.All of the light gathered toward Cai Cha\u2019s fingers, and in a split moment, the water within the violent sea region was forcefully isolated by Cai Cha\u2019s pipa sound. Everywhere the pipa sound passed through, the water elements vanished.\u201cRain Cutting Zither Sound.\u201dThe seemingly gentle and night mist-like pipa sound made Long Tao feel as though the surroundings were bizarre.The two lightly injured Deep Blue Dragon Jellyfish that were floating beside Long Tao and the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon had produced a water barrier. When the pipa sound smashed into the water barrier, the night mist scattered.The pipa sound was like a light drizzle that entered through all gaps. The pipa sound fused into the water but was able to slice the water barrier.Long Tao responded decisively and commanded the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon, \u201cWhite, Eight Dragon Shadows!\u201dAll of a sudden, the eight illusory dragon shadows appeared in front of the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon. Eight dragon shadows rushed at the pipa sound, and the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon executed the Sea Bite simultaneously.The pipa sound still managed to shatter the eight dragon shadows. The residual force damaged the Deep Blue Dragon Jellyfish and left them in a severely injured state. Long Tao then withdrew them into his spiritual spatial zone.Long Tao said in a cold tone, \u201cSince there isn\u2019t a need to reserve anymore, then I shall not hold back anymore.\u201dThree of his Long Tao\u2019s feys were severely injured, so he was truly enraged.Elder Meng knew it wasn\u2019t good and circulated the spiritual power within his body. If Cai Cha wasn\u2019t able to resist the attack, he would immediately rescue her. Elder Meng knew clearly how powerful Long Tao\u2019s attack was. Even if he was to receive this attack, he wouldn\u2019t end up good.The water elements gathered again, and the sea region instantly expanded by over two times.The Sea King Cretaceous Dragon\u2019s exclusive skills, Water Overseer, and Extremity of Sea were now utilized fully. The sea was moving violently, and such violent movements weren\u2019t possible with just the use of Whirl Flow. When the sea moved violently, Cai Cha\u2019s boundary shrunk down until it was only one meter.Cai Cha suddenly yelled, \u201cLast move!\u201dIn an instant, Cai Cha threw the pipa, which was transformed from Dark Dream Fragrant Tea using Tool Transformation, into the sky. The pipa reverted into the Dark Dream Fragrant Tea\u2019s original state.The moment the Dark Dream Fragrant Tea appeared, its body lit up with green radiance. The boundary that was originally shrunk down to one meter was instantly expanded to ten meters. It was just like a clean land in the midst of the ocean.As the seawater was shaking more intensively, the boundary that Dark Dream Fragrant Tea expanded was shrinking again.Cai Cha circulated all the spirit qi in her body.\u201cDark Dream Fragrant Tea, Dream Transformation.\u201d\u201cDream Beast of Night, Dream Consume.\u201dWith a burst of spiritual power from Cai Cha\u2019s body, the Dark Dream Fragrant Tea\u2019s entire tree body suddenly shrunk down into the size of a tea leaf. The small black beast jumped up and consumed the tea leaf into its body. All of a sudden, an aura of nature descended and shrunk the sea region, emptying out a piece of land that contested with the sea region.After the small black deer consumed the tea leaf, its hornless head suddenly grew out giant deer horns.The deer horns were like branches that were blooming with white flowers. The black pelt of the deer turned white instantly, and its size increased by several times. It was now a white stag that was over four meters in height. Wherever the hoofs stepped on, green grass would grow.The Dream Beast looked at Cai Cha, and the latter said gently, \u201cGo on.\u201dThe Dream Beast\u2019s horn lit up with green radiance and great power as it smashed at the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon.Long Tao didn\u2019t let the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon gather the surrounding water anymore and gave the command. \u201cWhite, Wrath of the Ocean! Sea Emperor\u2019s Dragon Breath!\u201dAt that moment, the sea finally stirred up. As compared to this moment, the sea was just playing around previously. The sea movements were so violent and loud that Lin Yuan could easily hear the sounds even when he was inside Cold Moon\u2019s spirit qi barrier.Lin Yuan watched as the wrath of the ocean, along with the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon\u2019s white dragon breath, collided with the pure white stag.Elder Meng, who had been standing by, suddenly rushed out, used his spirit qi to protect Cai Cha, and stood beside her.When the stag smashed toward the seawater, the clash was even, but the white dragon breath shattered the deer horn and was rushing at Cai Cha.The white dragon breath finally vanished after smashing into Elder Meng\u2019s protective barrier.Elder Meng\u2019s face looked very unpleasant right now. Not because Long Tao\u2019s attack was powerful, but he was rather upset as to why this Long Tao didn\u2019t hold back at all.This battle allowed Lin Yuan to finally know why the Radiance Hundred of the Radiance Federation was the federation\u2019s glory.The prowess of Sequence #3, Overflowing Sea, allowed Lin Yuan to find out the standard of the young generation that stood at the apex.Lin Yuan knew deeply that he was indeed still far inferior. However, he wasn\u2019t in a hurry to diminish his worth. After all, it had only been two months since he had changed from an ordinary person into a person who could sense spirit qi. The road ahead was still long, and no matter how high a mountain was, one would always start from the bottom.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 94": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 94Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCai Cha withdrew the injured feys into her spiritual spatial zone before bowing to Elder Meng as thanks. She then said to Long Tao, \u201cI lost. I am nearly ten years older than you, but I cannot even block your full-powered attack. No wonder you are Sequence #3.\u201dLong Tao\u2019s attack nearly wiped out all of his spiritual power, and he wasn\u2019t able to stand for a moment. Long Tao put his hand on the Sea King Cretaceous Dragon to support himself while he panted loudly. He didn\u2019t even have the strength to speak. Long Tao\u2019s current state was the symptom of spirit qi exhaustion.Upon seeing his state, Lin Yuan immediately used the Spirit-Gather Goldfish\u2019s ability, Spirit Injection, and released a portion of pure spirit qi toward Long Tao\u2019s body. It immediately helped Long Tao\u2019s exhausted spirit qi to recover a little. It might not be able to recover half the spirit qi, but it recovered enough for Long Tao to move normally.Long Tao cupped his fist toward Lin Yuan as an expression of thanks. When Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes met with Long Tao\u2019s eyes, Lin Yuan realized that Long Tao was looking at him with a scrutinizing gaze.Lin Yuan smiled and cupped his fist in return.Long Tao then turned to look at Cai Cha again. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t use the last move, I would not be able to defeat you either.\u201dLong Tao\u2019s statement might seem unreserved, but it was also his approval toward Cai Cha\u2019s strength.Apart from this, Lin Yuan realized that Cold Moon, Elder Meng, Elder Du, and Ling Xiao\u2019s eyes were all fixed on him. Lin Yuan silently thought whether it was rude to replenish Long Tao\u2019s spiritual power when all these experts were around.However, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know that these people were actually surprised at Lin Yuan\u2019s ability to replenish spiritual power in an instant.Lin Yuan hadn\u2019t summoned his fey when using the Spirit Injection ability, but instead, Lin Yuan just executed it casually.When healing-type and support-type spirit qi professionals were using healing-type and recovery-type abilities, they didn\u2019t have to summon feys and could use the abilities directly. But it would definitely cause the ability effect to receive a huge decline.Despite that, it was still enough for Long Tao to recover from a spirit qi exhaustion state.Before this, everyone only knew that Lin Yuan was a young prodigy that had directly passed the Class 2 Creation Master exam. They didn\u2019t expect that Lin Yuan would actually have such impressive support abilities.There were only a few rare abilities that could directly increase spiritual power, and the most common fey with the ability would be the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. However, the Spirit-Siphon Goldfish\u2019s trait was a reason why basically no one would choose it as their contracted fey.Therefore, when Lin Yuan revealed this ability, even these experts were rather surprised.Cold Moon\u2019s normally icy cold face had a trace of joy as she said to Lin Yuan, \u201cAn ability to replenish spiritual power is able to significantly increase your capability to fight and survive in the wild. Very good.\u201dAfter being praised by Cold Moon, Lin Yuan felt a little embarrassed.Cheng Rui was now the one that had been neglected. Elder Du, who stood behind Cheng Rui, had much gloomier eyes when he looked at Long Tao and had this additional trace of fear.If someone else possessed Long Tao\u2019s combat capabilities, Cheng Rui might not feel anything. Nevertheless, Long Tao\u2019s Creation Master capability was even better than Cheng Rui\u2019s right now. This made Cheng Rui know that he couldn\u2019t seek trouble with Long Tao.However, when Cheng Rui looked at Lin Yuan, his eyes weren\u2019t just filled with jealousy. They were also filled with gloom, like when he looked at Long Tao.Lin Yuan felt Cheng Rui\u2019s eyes. Given his two lives\u2019 experiences, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have a youth\u2019s mentality anymore, and after encountering eyes like Cheng Rui\u2019s, he roughly understood that someone was jealous of him. Such eyes made Lin Yuan frown a little.Cold Moon witnessed everything.Originally, Cai Cha should hand over the sword token to Long Tao for him to exchange a treasure, but Cold Moon stepped up and said, \u201cOriginally, the treasure you can exchange with the sword token is some high-grade spiritual ingredient, and it is similarly precious to the pearl you\u2019ve obtained previously. Since Cai Cha injured three of your feys, I shall change the reward to ten drops of Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia\u2019s nectar.\u201dCold Moon\u2019s words caused Long Tao\u2019s face to involuntarily light up with delight, and even Elder Meng\u2019s face was smiling with radiance.When Lin Yuan saw this scene, he immediately understood how precious the Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia\u2019s nectar was. Lin Yuan still remembered that the silver-robed man had even said that he wanted to give Lin Yuan an entire bowl to drink. Back then, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t feel anything and thought it was only a part of the reception. But now, Lin Yuan knew that he couldn\u2019t accept such precious things so casually.After speaking, Cold Moon changed the topic and looked at Cheng Rui. \u201cThere is only the gray box left. It is your turn to open the box.\u201dCheng Rui had a delighted expression as he quickly went up to open the box. After opening the box, he saw a bottle of blood that had a trace of purple and a token.Just as Cheng Rui was preparing to pick up the bottle of blood, Cold Moon\u2019s words made him withdraw his hand. \u201cThe blood in the bottle belongs to a Diamond snake-species fey. But there is a rule to obtain this gray box. If you don\u2019t win the contest, you will not only be unable to obtain a new treasure, but you will also not be able to obtain the Diamond snake blood.\u201dAfter speaking, Cold Moon gave an eye signal to one of the tea attendants, while the three others, including Cai Cha, returned to their corners.When Cold Moon returned to Lin Yuan\u2019s side, the remaining tea attendant said, \u201cI am Xi Cha. I will be the one to have a contest with you.\u201dCheng Rui had already picked up the token and saw an exquisite tool drawn on it. It meant that this was a contest between Creation Masters, which gave Cheng Rui a boost of confidence.Despite that, Cheng Rui didn\u2019t understand why the gray box\u2019s treasure could only be obtained after he won the contest, while Long Tao didn\u2019t have to. He couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cI wonder why my contest rule is different from the other box?\u201dXi Cha was a person with a hot temperament, so when Cheng Rui asked like this, she immediately replied, \u201cBecause this is the Leaning Moon Mountain\u2019s Radiant Moon Palace.\u201dXi Cha\u2019s temperament was simply like a chili pepper, and her words were truly stinging.Lin Yuan immediately saw Elder Du step forward and say to Xi Cha, \u201cCheng Rui doesn\u2019t know the rules. Will the tea attendant please forgive him!\u201dCheng Rui was originally filled with confidence, but after hearing Xi Cha\u2019s response, his mental state became a little unstable.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t understand what was happening either, but Cold Moon was looking at Cheng Rui with eyes of contempt.Back when Cheng Rui looked at Lin Yuan with those jealous eyes, Cold Moon was already unhappy.The Moon Empress might not have officially accepted Lin Yuan as a disciple, but Mystic Moon wasn\u2019t the only person who understood the Moon Empress. Cold Moon was the same too.Lin Yuan becoming the Moon Empress\u2019 disciple was something that was already determined, so Cold Moon was a little protective.Even if Cheng Rui was just a junior, Cold Moon didn\u2019t ignore him. Cold Moon had an icy cold demeanor, and she didn\u2019t have a protective personality. However, after following the Moon Empress for a long time, she was slightly affected by the Moon Empress\u2019 personality.Therefore, her protective behavior might not be obvious, but she had already arranged all the difficulties for Cheng Rui.It was also because of Cheng Rui that caused Cold Moon to look at Elder Du with unfriendly eyes.Lin Yuan, who was standing by the side, didn\u2019t know of Cold Moon\u2019s thoughts. Instead, he was looking at the contest that was considered an apex contest between the young Creation Masters.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 95": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 95Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLin Yuan never knew what the standard of his Creation Master\u2019s capabilities was. After all, Lin Yuan had never made contact with any proper Creation Master before. Take Elder Ning, for example. Lin Yuan only knew that Elder Ning was a Class 4 Creation Master, but never saw him at work.Lin Yuan knew that a regular Creation Master would be using the concoction of spiritual ingredients to enhance a fey and upgrade its quality. As for the proper method of concoction, it was something that Lin Yuan had never seen before. Even a Class 1 Creation Master\u2019s method was something that Lin Yuan had never witnessed before.Since there was an opportunity now, Lin Yuan was watching in a particularly serious manner.Cold Moon didn\u2019t have much reaction as she felt that it was rather boring, so she shifted most of her attention to Lin Yuan.Cai Cha, who was standing at one of the four corners, was looking at Cheng Rui with rather interested eyes.\u00a0I wonder what this Cheng Rui did to offend Cold Moon and caused her to choose Xi Cha to conduct the contest.Among the four sisters, Xi Cha was the one with the best Creation Master talent. Even if she hadn\u2019t gone through any Creation Master exam, she was definitely at the standard of a Class 3 Creation Master. This contest should have a rather obvious result.Xi Cha used her hand to knock on the platform and asked with a fiery tone, \u201cFor the Creation Master contest, do you want to evolve a fey, upgrade the fey\u2019s quality, or to heal a fey with damaged roots? You can choose the method of contest.\u201dCheng Rui\u2019s face was instantly overjoyed after hearing the question. His nervous and affected mental state was now finally reverted to normal. He quickly said, \u201cLet\u2019s compete by healing a fey\u2019s damaged roots.\u201dCheng Rui\u2019s extremely fast response made Lin Yuan involuntarily raise his brows.\u00a0It seems like this Cheng Rui is very adept at healing a fey\u2019s damaged roots. He actually believes that his chances of winning are higher. Otherwise, he wouldn\u2019t be in such a hurry to make a decision.Xi Cha clapped thrice before she said indifferently, \u201cAs you wish.\u201dSoon enough, two black hound-like feys were brought over. The two hound-like feys were both half a meter in size. They had pointed ears, but they had plenty of teeth that were jutting out, making them abnormally sharp.Lin Yuan could recognize that these were Violent Blood Terror Wolf pups and were considered extremely rare feys.The Violent Blood Terror Wolf was a mighty Platinum fey, and the pups that were produced were already Silver.These two Violent Blood Terror Wolf pups were only born for a few months and already had damaged roots.Upon noticing their dying state, Lin Yuan carefully observed the two Violent Blood Terror Wolf pups. He might be rather far away, but Lin Yuan could still see that the two Violent Blood Terror Wolf pups\u2019 eyes were already so swollen that they nearly couldn\u2019t open. Their sharp-pointed ears also had large amounts of black blood scabs.All these symptoms clearly indicated that the two pups had suffered trauma, and the injury was in the head. Their brains might have been damaged even with their tough skulls\u2019 protection. The brain was where wisdom came from, and beast-type feys with damaged brains were extremely hard to heal.Before becoming a C-rank spirit qi professional, if Lin Yuan used the Pure Land of Bliss within the Spirit Lock spatial zone, he would need to use several days in order to rescue these pups. To be reserved, he would need at least two full days.After becoming a C-rank spirit qi professional, Lin Yuan still didn\u2019t know his capability to enhance feys yet. However, he could imagine that he would definitely spend less time than before.At that moment, Lin Yuan saw that Cheng Rui and Xi Cha had started to move. Both of them used a specific proportion and made a concoction with the spiritual ingredients within the crystal tool.Both of them had proficient skills, but there were subtle differences.Lin Yuan could obviously feel that Xi Cha\u2019s spiritual ingredients preparation was faster than Cheng Rui\u2019s, but it wasn\u2019t significantly faster.Different types of spiritual ingredients were steadily added to the crystal bottle. Every time a new spiritual ingredient was added inside, the medicinal fluid within the crystal bottle would undergo a different transformation.As they concocted, Lin Yuan could see that although Cheng Rui and Xi Cha possessed the same spiritual ingredients, their recipes weren\u2019t really the same. One could see the difference just from the color and texture.Xi Cha\u2019s concoction was a medicinal fluid that was amber in color and viscous like honey. Cheng Rui\u2019s concoction was dark green, and it was constantly bubbling with opaque spirit fluid.The duo took a concoction time of around three to four hours.As Lin Yuan watched carefully, he had a rough idea of how Creation Masters worked. As compared to the concoction of spiritual ingredients, his method was still more direct and simple. However, the efficiency of Lin Yuan\u2019s simple and direct method would depend on his spirit qi rank.Therefore, Lin Yuan only required to increase his spirit qi professional rank to enhance his Creation Master\u2019s capability. For Lin Yuan to increase his spirit qi professional rank, he could only do so by evolving more feys. As a result, Lin Yuan\u2019s objectives to increase his spirit qi professional rank and Creation Master\u2019s capability would become the same matter.Cheng Rui was steadily concocting the spiritual ingredients. During the concoction, Cheng Rui suddenly placed the crystal tool on the platform, and he let out a deep smile when he looked up to see Xi Cha still concocting the spiritual ingredients.Lin Yuan could see the Cheng Rui was circulating the spiritual power within his body. When circulating the spiritual power, Cheng Rui\u2019s face appeared to be in pain as it nearly distorted.After a moment, Cheng Rui\u2019s skin under his sleeve appeared with a rather big bump, and it was moving toward Cheng Rui\u2019s hukou\u00a0acupoint1. At the hukou acupoint, the bump was getting increasingly bigger as though something was bursting out.Cheng Rui let out a grunt, and a five- or six-centimeter figure emerged, and it was like a small spine. It was an insect with dozens of legs.Cold Moon frowned and asked Elder Du in a cold voice, \u201cThis is the source-type lifeform, Spine\u00a0Gu1?\u201dElder Du nodded in response.Lin Yuan never expected the thing that emerged from the flesh was actually Cheng Rui\u2019s contracted source-type lifeform.This source-type lifeform lived in the contractor\u2019s body, and when called upon, it would bring extreme pain to the contractor. Even with such a source-type lifeform, Cheng Rui still chose to summon it during the contest. It meant that he was striving his best to win this contest.But from the looks of things now, Xi Cha was only left with a few spiritual ingredients she had yet to use, meaning that Xi Cha\u2019s concocted spirit fluid was about to be completed.On the contrary, Cheng Rui still had half the spiritual ingredients he had yet to use.Elder Du didn\u2019t think that Cheng Rui would actually summon the source-type lifeform, Spine Gu. He sighed and said, \u201cCheng Rui\u2019s grandfather is Cheng Wu, and this Spine Gu is separated out from Master Cheng Wu\u2019s Gold Ring Spine Gu.\u201dWhen mentioning Cheng Wu\u2019s name, Elder Du didn\u2019t look good. After hearing Elder Du\u2019s words, Lin Yuan might not know who Cheng Wu was, but Elder Du was a Class 4 Creation Master, and if he addressed Cheng Wu as a master, it meant that Cheng Wu was one of those pinnacle Class 4 Creation Masters just a step away from reaching the Class 5 Creation Master.It seemed like Cheng Rui was a rather powerful third-generation descendant.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 96": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 96Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCold Moon responded by looking at Elder Du with her deep eyes and said, \u201cIt seems like Cheng Wu has really taken up a role in your Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association. It is such a huge matter, but why didn\u2019t you announce it?\u201dElder Du quickly replied, \u201cElder Cheng has only arrived at the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association recently. For the recent period of time, he doesn\u2019t have any plans of becoming a Vice President. When Elder Cheng makes the decision, we will announce it.\u201dCold Moon was rather surprised that Cheng Wu, a pinnacle Class 4 Creation Master, would actually choose to take the role as a Vice President in the Royal Capital\u2019s Creation Master Association, instead of being an honorary elder. But after slight contemplation, Cold Moon understood.\u201cThat is true. Since he already knows that he doesn\u2019t have a chance of becoming a Class 5 Creation Master, he should plan for the Cheng Family\u2019s younger generation. But if this Cheng Rui is really talented, why would Cheng Wu allow Cheng Rui to form a contract with the source-type lifeform, Spine Gu?\u201dCold Moon\u2019s words were clear and cold, but when Elder Du heard them, he revealed an awkward expression and didn\u2019t know what to say for a moment.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t really understand the conversation between Cold Moon and Elder Du, but he knew that it would be extremely inappropriate for him to suddenly seek clarification.Who would have expected for Cold Moon to look at Lin Yuan and ask, \u201cLin Yuan, do you know what is the source-type lifeform, Spine Gu?\u201dLin Yuan shook his head. Cold Moon could see the desire for an answer in Lin Yuan\u2019s eyes, so she explained, \u201cThe Spine Gu is a source-type lifeform, and after forming a contract with it, it won\u2019t be stored within the spiritual spatial zone like other feys. The Spine Gu will reside within the contractor\u2019s spinal column and empty out one of the spine segments as its nest. Those who form contracts with the Spine Gu will damage their innate vitality. Therefore, Creation Masters who form contracts with the Spine Gu will never reach Class 5.\u201dLin Yuan was flabbergasted and didn\u2019t know that the Spine Gu was such a source-type lifeform. But it was rather understandable too, as his Red Thorn was also very special. However, Red Thorn\u2019s special trait was its need for fresh blood when forming the contract, and that it didn\u2019t follow a specific model, requiring the contractor to specify the evolution.Red Thorn\u2019s peculiarity allowed Lin Yuan to quickly accept the existence of a special source-type lifeform like the Spine Gu.Seeing that Lin Yuan had already digested her information, Cold Moon continued talking, \u201cThe Spine Gu might damage the contractor\u2019s innate vitality to a certain extent, but to Creation Masters, they are supreme treasures. The Spine Gu can rapidly synthesize massive amounts of spiritual ingredients that the contractor consumes and form a concentrated spirit fluid within the body. When concocting spiritual ingredients, the Spine Gu can devour and catalyze all the spiritual ingredients accumulated in the body, allowing the effects of the spiritual ingredients to be pushed to the greatest extent.\u201cHowever, there is also a disadvantage\u2026 By fusing spiritual ingredients in this way, it will use up the Spine Gu\u2019s bodily fluids. After the concoction, the contractor will need to consume a great number of spiritual ingredients. Otherwise, the Spine Gu will not have sufficient spirit fluids and will consume the spinal cord within the spine.\u201dCold Moon got rid of her cold and indifferent personality as she explained all the information to Lin Yuan with details.Finally, Lin Yuan learned what Spine Gu\u2019s use was. However, after knowing, Lin Yuan\u2019s impression of the Spine Gu became bad.When contracting a fey, the fey should be a partner, unlike the Spine Gu, which would use the contractor\u2019s spine as a residence. Slicing off flesh to feed to the eagle might be good, but it was to slice the flesh of a lamb. If one was slicing their own flesh to feed the eagle, Lin Yuan felt it would be very foolish.At that moment, Cheng Rui commanded the Spine Gu to rapidly devour the spiritual ingredients, and it suddenly increased the efficiency. In just a few short minutes, Cheng Rui was already catching up to Xi Cha\u2019s pace.When Cheng Rui had summoned the Spine Gu earlier and grunted, Xi Cha had already been looking at Cheng Rui with dissatisfaction. It was a huge taboo to disturb a Creation Master when they concocted spiritual ingredients. When the contest had started, Cold Moon had already used her spiritual power to isolate the platform from the outside world as she had been afraid something or someone might affect the contest.Unexpectedly, Cheng Rui had publicly affected his opponent during the spiritual ingredient concoction.Just as Xi Cha was about to complain, she saw Cheng Rui summoning the Spine Gu. She then said helplessly, \u201cI didn\u2019t actually plan to use a fey\u2019s support, but since you have done so, I shall do it too.\u201dXi Cha had also circulated her spiritual power and summoned a pitcher plant-like fey. Xi Cha then grabbed the concocted but not purified spirit fluid and poured it into the pitcher plant-like fey. She then constantly poured spiritual power into the fey.After a sequence of actions, Cheng Rui and Xi Cha had finished the spirit fluid\u2019s concoction at almost the same timing. However, Cheng Rui\u2019s concocted spirit fluid was produced from the Spine Gu\u2019s abdomen, while Xi Cha\u2019s spirit fluid was produced from the pitcher plant\u2019s body.The duo then fed their respective spirit fluids to the Violent Blood Terror Wolf pups that had severely injured heads.In just a few short minutes, the two Violent Blood Terror Wolf pups were treated simultaneously. They immediately turned better and started to move. From time to time, they would be using their fangs to bite at the cage.The Violent Blood Terror Wolves were extremely violent even as pups.After the contest, it seemed like an evenly matched outcome, but Cheng Rui spoke first. \u201cI won because my Violent Blood Terror Wolf upgraded from Silver III to Silver IV.\u201dCheng Rui then immediately reached out for the Diamond snake-species fey\u2019s purple-red blood. But before he could touch the bottle of snake blood, a mocking voice echoed. \u201cDo you think you have won just because you upgraded the Violent Blood Terror Wolf from Silver III to Silver IV and also treated it? Why? Didn\u2019t you see that my Violent Blood Terror Wolf\u2019s quality has also been upgraded from Elite to Flawless?\u201dAfter speaking, Xi Cha bowed to Cold Moon before returning to her corner. Xi Cha\u2019s words had stunned Cheng Rui, whose face was as red as a pig\u2019s liver.Elder Du wanted to go up and console Cheng Rui, but Long Tao unexpectedly gave a big applause and laughed heartily. \u201cTruly exciting!\u201dCheng Rui\u2019s eyes turned blood-red after getting agitated by the applause, and he glared at Long Tao. Long Tao didn\u2019t think anything of it and raised his leg to pat off the inexistent dust on his boots. It felt as though Long Tao had casually swept off Cheng Rui\u2019s glare.\u201cLong Tao, I swear that we will always be in hostile terms!\u201dLong Tao didn\u2019t even bother about the enraged Cheng Rui and ignored those harsh words.As Cheng Rui flipped out, a bone-chilling pressure nearly froze Cheng Rui in place. It caused Cheng Rui to stagger, and he was about to kneel on the ground.Elder Du quickly went forward to help Cheng Rui and said to Cold Moon, \u201cEnvoy Cold Moon, Cheng Rui isn\u2019t intentionally being presumptuous in the Radiant Moon Palace. This is Cheng Rui\u2019s first visit, and he doesn\u2019t know the rules. Will Envoy Cold Moon please forgive him?\u201dCold Moon\u2019s aura instantly burst out as she said with a chilly voice, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t dare to be presumptuous, but it still happened. To speak of such threatening words in the Radiant Moon Palace, are you the one that asked him to do it? Or did you not teach him the rules of the Radiant Moon Palace before bringing him here?\u201d1Cold sweat was dripping off Elder Du\u2019s head.During this decade, the Moon Empress had been in seclusion, and the two Moon Envoys had been quietly cultivating in the Leaning Moon Mountain. Thus, they rarely ventured into the world.How could Elder Du have forgotten about Envoy Cold Moon\u2019s temperament?One of the aristocrats in the Royal Capital, Marquis Jing Shi, had been insufferably arrogant 15 years ago and had been disrespectful to Envoy Cold Moon. She had simply broken his legs, and he had been sitting in the wheelchair ever since.On that night, Marquis Jing Shi\u2019s residence had been completely frozen. The marquis residence hall had been cleaved into two, and no one knew what had happened.Given Marquis Jing Shi\u2019s strength as a high-ranked king-class expert, his legs should have already recovered by now, but he didn\u2019t dare to stand back up from the wheelchair until now. He had been sitting in the wheelchair for 15 years, and there wasn\u2019t a need to explain why.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 97": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Fey Evolution MerchantCH 97Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayMarquis Jing Shi had been truly influential in the Royal Capital back then. Plenty of king-class experts had met with setbacks from Marquis Jing Shi. With a Diamond X/Fantasy III, Desert Mad Lion, along with the old marquis backing him up, few of the same age dared to confront him.Nonetheless, when the intolerably arrogant Marquis Jing Shi had had a few drinks in a banquet and spoken disrespectfully to Envoy Cold Moon, he had even started to provoke her in public. The result was having both his legs frozen to the bones, nearly shattering. It was truly pitiful.Elder Du quickly replied, \u201cEnvoy Cold Moon, how would I dare to not teach him the rules of the Radiant Moon Palace? It is Cheng Rui who is slow-witted and didn\u2019t learn them well. I will bring Cheng Rui back to give him a harsh lesson and teach him well on the rules of the Radiant Moon Palace.\u201dWhen Elder Du was speaking, his back was already drenched with cold sweat. As a Class 4 Creation Master, Elder Du believed that he was considered outstanding among the other Class 4 Creation Masters, however, he still had a very long way before he could reach the pinnacle of Class 4 Creation Master. As for Class 5 Creation Master, Elder Du didn\u2019t even dare to think about that level from a Class 4 Creation Master\u2019s perspective.Even among king-class experts, his combat capability was far inferior to his own Creation Master capability. He was only barely a king-class expert, and his status was simply negligible in the Radiant Moon Palace. If he said something wrong, he might be crippled, and there was a chance that he might not even be thrown off the Leaning Moon Mountain.Cold Moon seldom ventured out for the past dozen years, but her title as \u2018Ironman Triathlon\u2019 was still etched in many people\u2019s memories due to the Marquis Jing Shi\u2019s incident.Ironman Triathlon didn\u2019t refer to Cold Moon\u2019s sports capability. It was her style of handling matters\u2014iron wrist, iron fist, and an iron heart.Cold Moon\u2019s bone-chilling aura didn\u2019t reduce, and all of a sudden, her eyes looked as though they appeared with a pair of whirling frost. Within a split moment, Elder Du felt as though he was being buried under a giant glacier. Elder Du was able to support Cheng Rui earlier, but now, even Elder Du was getting unsteady.The blood color in Cheng Rui\u2019s eyes had already scattered, and after sensing Elder Du shivering, he suddenly felt that he was at his wits\u2019 end and lost all reliance. When Cheng Rui panicked, he yelled out with a sobbing tone, \u201cMy grandfather is Cheng Wu, a pinnacle Class 4 Creation Master!\u201dCheng Rui yelled out very loudly as though he was trying to use his yells to give himself some courage.When Cold Moon heard the statement, her emotionless face suddenly revealed a smile, and brilliance of frost immediately burst out.As soon as Cheng Rui yelled out that his grandfather was Cheng Wu, Elder Du knew things weren\u2019t going to end well.In the Radiant Moon Palace, let alone your grandfather is a pinnacle Class 4 Creation Master. Even if the Class 5 Creation Masters, Bamboo Monarch, and Chef Supreme were here, Cold Moon wouldn\u2019t let this matter rest so easily.The Moon Empress had always been dominant, and the two Moon Envoys represented the Moon Empress\u2019 will. Pinnacle Class 4 Creation Masters were still Class 4 Creation Masters, after all. The gap between Class 4 and Class 5 Creation Masters was like a chasm between heaven and earth.A Class 4 Creation Master\u2019s limit was to nurture a fey to Fantasy V, while Class 5 Creation Masters were qualified to ascend into myths.Looking at the tense situation, Lin Yuan felt as though his heart was getting suspended too. Cold Moon\u2019s aura might not be targeted at him, but he could still feel a pressure within his soul. It was a pressure as though someone was looking down at you from the clouds. It was a feeling that couldn\u2019t be resisted.Cheng Rui\u2019s Creation Master capabilities were considered exceptional, especially on his usage of the Spine Gu. He was basically at the standard of a Class 3 Creation Master. For the current Lin Yuan, Cheng Rui was considered a formidable foe. But after seeing Cheng Rui\u2019s earlier performance, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t treat Cheng Rui as a formidable foe anymore.All of a sudden, Cold Moon turned to look at Lin Yuan and asked, \u201cTell me, how should rude individuals be punished?\u201dLin Yuan looked at Elder Du, who was perspiring with cold sweat, first. It was unknown why Lin Yuan felt as though he could see Elder Ning\u2019s shadows behind Elder Du. They were all Creation Masters that were helping the Radiance Federation to enhance and rescue feys, to help spirit qi professionals with the breakthrough of their feys\u2019 limits.From the looks of Cold Moon\u2019s expression, if Elder Du and Cheng Rui didn\u2019t pay a certain price, they wouldn\u2019t be able to leave unscathed.When Lin Yuan looked at Cold Moon, he realized that Cold Moon was very seriously looking at him. As of now, Lin Yuan still didn\u2019t know what to say. However, he didn\u2019t wish for Elder Du to perish in this place just because of a few statements. Since Cold Moon asked him, Lin Yuan followed his heart and said, \u201cA rude individual should naturally be punished, but there is a reason for the rude words. Elder Du did so to protect Cheng Rui, therefore, his intention is to protect the young generation.\u201dCold Moon\u2019s aura suddenly pressed harder, allowing Lin Yuan to feel the pressure that Elder Du and Cheng Rui were feeling earlier. Lin Yuan\u2019s forehead was already starting to sweat. However, due to his three Willpower Runes\u2014they didn\u2019t just enhance his spiritual energy, but they also toughened Lin Yuan\u2019s spiritual defense to a certain extent\u2014he didn\u2019t look miserable.When Cold Moon saw it, she was rather surprised.Cold Moon spoke. \u201cDo you mean that all of this is Cheng Rui\u2019s fault and punishing him alone is enough?\u201dSince Lin Yuan had already spoken, he shook his head in response to Cold Moon\u2019s question. \u201cWhen judging a person, I will never see how high their capability can bring them. Instead, I will see how low their mistakes can drop them. Cheng Rui\u2019s words have implicated the person beside him and the elders in his family. After returning, he will have plenty of punishments waiting for him. As such, why don\u2019t you allow Elder Du to bring Cheng Rui back for some teachings and also to tell Cheng Rui\u2019s elders about his wrongdoings today?\u201dLin Yuan remained silent for three seconds before speaking again. \u201cCreation Masters are precious resources in the Radiance Federation. Even if they should be punished, they should be punished by asking them to heal more feys.\u201dAfter Lin Yuan finished speaking, he felt Cold Moon\u2019s aura suddenly being withdrawn. When he looked at Cold Moon again, he noticed that Cold Moon\u2019s eyes had already changed. She was now looking at him with approval and compassion.Cold Moon looked at Lin Yuan.\u00a0I didn\u2019t expect this young prodigy to actually be rather kind. He is finding all sorts of reasons and hoping that I will not be too harsh. In the end, Lin Yuan\u2019s reasons are all in consideration of the Radiance Federation.From Lin Yuan\u2019s information, Cold Moon felt that Lin Yuan should be a young man who had basically received zero benefits from the Radiance Federation. His ability to look for the light even when he was in desperate straits was truly a quality that was very rare and precious.When Cold Moon asked Lin Yuan the question, she wanted to test him and see what Lin Yuan answered. This question didn\u2019t have a model answer. Nonetheless, Lin Yuan\u2019s answer gave Cold Moon a pleasant surprise.When Cold Moon withdrew her aura, Elder Du pulled Cheng Rui and thanked Lin Yuan. But when Cheng Rui bowed to give his thanks, the fear in his eyes had already scattered, and they were now even redder than before. His eyes concealed a bitter tinge of resentment that was slowly accumulating.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 98": "Chapter 98: The Perturbed Moon EmpressCold Moon didn\u2019t bother about Elder Du, who bowed to thank Lin Yuan, and immediately walked to the platform. She then said to Elder Meng, who was watching the show, \u201cYou may return after receiving the gift from the Moon Empress. Three days later, I will deliver another 20 drops of Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar to Elder Meng. After all, Elder Meng has been forced to watch a charade at the Radiant Moon Palace.\u201dElder Meng quickly bowed to Cold Moon. The earlier situation with Elder Du had really shocked Elder Meng, and if he were to speak out of turn, he might suffer the same fate. However, the additional 20 drops of Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar made Elder Meng so overjoyed that he couldn\u2019t cover his mouth.\u201cEnvoy Cold Moon, then I shall bring Long Tao back.\u201d Elder Meng could see what was happening.Just by looking at Cold Moon\u2019s attitude toward Lin Yuan, he already knew that Long Tao and Cheng Rui were just here to put on a show. However, this trip\u2019s gifts were already enough to compensate for Elder Meng\u2019s disappointment.As Elder Meng was preparing to lead Long Tao back, he turned to see Long Tao standing with Lin Yuan.\u201cThank you for helping me to recover my spiritual power. Otherwise, I would have made a joke of myself.\u201dLin Yuan laughed heartily and said, \u201cIt is just a small matter.\u201dAfter hearing and seeing Lin Yuan\u2019s smile, Long Tao didn\u2019t know why he started laughing too. \u201cIf Brother Yuan is going to have a meal in the Royal Capital, remember to look for me for a drink.\u201dElder Meng then departed with Long Tao from the Leaning Moon Mountain.Elder Du quickly apologized to Cold Moon again before he dragged Cheng Rui away from the Leaning Moon Mountain in an unpleasant mood.When going down the mountain, Elder Du especially stopped midway the mountain before he continued on his way down again. Elder Du didn\u2019t have the face to meet with Elder Meng, who had received great rewards, right now.Apart from Cold Moon and Lin Yuan in the Radiant Moon Palace, only the four tea attendants that were looking at Lin Yuan curiously and Ling Xiao were left.Ling Xiao might be standing there and looking at Lin Yuan with calm eyes, but her heart was filled with joy. She could naturally see how Cold Moon and Mystic Moon treated Lin Yuan. She could also see how protective Cold Moon was toward Lin Yuan. Therefore, the chance of Lin Yuan getting picked as the Moon Empress\u2019 disciple was already 70%.Cold Moon walked toward Lin Yuan and said, \u201cThe two contests today were arranged by the Moon Empress. She wanted you to witness the Radiance Generation\u2019s young generation\u2019s pinnacle standard, be it in Creation Master capability or spirit qi professional capability. Walk toward the inner palace yourself. After walking through the hallway, you will reach the inner palace. The Moon Empress is waiting for you there.\u201dLin Yuan never expected that these two exciting contests had actually been prepared for him. At first, Lin Yuan had been wondering why he hadn\u2019t needed to go through any contest. But after watching the two contests and understanding their standards, Lin Yuan knew that his strength was still not competent enough.While walking in the hallway, Lin Yuan was feeling apprehensive. He was about to meet one of the three Class 5 Creation Masters of the Radiance Federation, the Moon Empress. In the past, Lin Yuan would have never imagined that he could make such close contact with a pinnacle expert of this era.Lin Yuan was very smart. When he had been ascending the Leaning Moon Mountain with Mystic Moon, he had been paying attention to the conversation between Elder Meng. Elder Du, and Ling Xiao. He had found out that the purpose of coming to this place might be to become the Moon Empress\u2019 disciple, and it was the great benefit that Elder Ning had been envious of.At that thought, Lin Yuan became even more nervous. Unbeknownst to Lin Yuan, another person was more perturbed than him.In the inner palace was a lady that was arranging brocade boxes on a rack by the side of the lotus lake while muttering something, \u201c\u202696, 97, 98, 99, 100. 100 gifts should be enough! I don\u2019t know how to be a Master either. Will it be too stingy to only give 100 gifts to a precious disciple on the first meeting?\u201dThe lady in the moon robes was holding her chin and looking at the brocade boxes on the rack. She was uncertain whether she should bring out more precious treasures.If someone else was watching from the side, even Cold Moon and Mystic Moon would be shocked. Was this the Moon Empress who was always calm like the lonely moon? 100 boxes of treasures were enough to shock the entire Radiance Federation, so who would actually feel it was stingy?The Moon Empress looked at the brocade boxes and couldn\u2019t help but recall the scene when she was young and with her master. While reminiscing, the Moon Empress was so angry that the roots of her teeth started to ache.Apart from teaching me knowledge on the Creation Master profession, that old bastard would bring me to all sorts of treacherous places and was always so fierce. But when I became a Class 3 Creation Master, that old bastard actually passed away.It was a painful memory that was etched in the Moon Empress\u2019 heart. After so many years, she had removed the pain, and it had now turned into yearning.The Moon Empress never had any disciple, so now that she was going to accept one, she was a little out of place. However, after recalling her late master\u2019s way of teaching, she decided that she would pamper her disciple.Since the moment the Moon Empress had decided to accept a disciple, she had already been prepared to give herself another status as a master. Therefore, when Lin Yuan had appeared, and she found out about Lin Yuan\u2019s history, she might not have mentioned it, but she had already had plans in her heart.With this thought, and since Lin Yuan had arrived at the Leaning Moon Mountain, the Moon Empress used her spiritual energy to sense everything Lin Yuan said and did. She had been very satisfied until the moment Cold Moon tested Lin Yuan. When Lin Yuan spoke in defense of Elder Du and Cheng Rui, the Moon Empress had a deeper impression of Lin Yuan. It allowed the Moon Empress to have a more solid impression of Lin Yuan.Originally, the Moon Empress had been planning to test Lin Yuan, but she was now busy considering how to pamper her disciple.When Lin Yuan\u2019s footsteps got nearer, the Moon Empress could already hear them clearly. She took a deep breath and reverted to her regular attitude.When Lin Yuan arrived at the inner palace, he was shocked by the scenery. It couldn\u2019t be just described as luxurious, as it wasn\u2019t due to the precious decorations. It was the number of powerful and rare feys within this place.The inner palace was just like an immortal realm. The massive lotus lake had dozens of species of lotus flowers that he didn\u2019t know the names of. But after using True Data to check, none of the lotus feys were lower than diamond-grade.However, before Lin Yuan could notice the information, he was attracted by a figure in a moon-colored robe. Lin Yuan didn\u2019t know how he should address her, but the Moon Empress walked forward and asked, \u201cDo you have any request to become my disciple?\u201dThe Moon Empress was thinking of how to be more amiable on her approach, but she immediately asked for any request when she spoke.After speaking, the Moon Empress was rather regretful.\u00a0Does it seem too obvious that I want to accept him as a disciple?Lin Yuan didn\u2019t think that the Moon Empress, a Class 5 Creation Master, would actually ask such a question for her first statement. However, while Lin Yuan had been on his way there, he had already thought about it. Even if he were to become the Moon Empress\u2019 disciple, he had to tread on the path of becoming an expert on his own and with determination.\u201cMoon Empress, I don\u2019t have any request to become your disciple. However, I wish that I can rely on my own diligence to walk on my own path.\u201dThese words instantly threw off the Moon Empress.If that\u2019s the case, didn\u2019t I prepare these 100 precious treasures for nothing? Why is my disciple so considerate!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, he quickly sorted out the thoughts in his mind.When speaking with the Moon Empress, Lin Yuan was originally very nervous, but he had a subtle feeling that she was even more nervous than him. After some idle conversation, the Moon Empress didn\u2019t mention the matter of accepting a disciple.It was already rather late, so the Moon Empress arranged for Lin Yuan to stay in the pavilion inside of the Radiant Moon Palace\u2019s inner palace.When Lin Yuan was looking at this room\u2019s furnishing, an orchid started emitting a faint fragrance. The orchid\u2019s leaves were lush green, and the stalk was straight. Within the lush leaves was a spotlessly white flower that bloomed. Just by watching, it would invigorate a person.If the Moon Empress said that she wanted to take Lin Yuan as a disciple, he felt that it was rather sudden, and he wasn\u2019t mentally prepared at all. If the Moon Empress was really accepting a disciple, no one would refuse. But Lin Yuan was different.Since young, Lin Yuan had a pitiful number of constraints. As of now, apart from Chu Ci, Lin Yuan\u2019s only constraint was Liu Jie, who he had recently accepted as a retainer.Since ancient times, once a Master, always a father. The term \u2018Master\u2019 carried a deep constraint. It was a relationship that could be considered as close as kinship.The affection between Master and disciple was very important, but now, Lin Yuan didn\u2019t have much affection toward the Moon Empress. At best, it would be respect. Therefore, if Lin Yuan had to call the Moon Empress his Master, he really didn\u2019t know how to deal with it.While Lin Yuan was in contemplation, the Moon Empress was gently swirling the water within the lotus lake.At that moment, large fish that were half a meter in length emerged from underneath the lotus leaf. They looked like peonies that were blooming in the water. Their tails were like dresses that were layered and filled with grace and grandeur.If Lin Yuan saw these fish, he would certainly be astonished as they were all Spirit-Siphon Goldfish. These Spirit-Siphon Goldfish in the lotus lake had already evolved to platinum-grade.The Moon Empress was currently using her fingers to swirl in the water and causing ripples. The Spirit-Siphon Goldfish had all come closer to the Moon Empress. When she was swirling the water, she was thinking about her first meeting with Lin Yuan.The Moon Empress was very satisfied with Lin Yuan and admired him. After knowing about Lin Yuan\u2019s experiences when growing up, she was actually filled with tender affection toward him. However, she too knew that she had treated the acceptance of a disciple too simply.The Moon Empress was always dominant and dealt with matters with extreme simplicity, but after today\u2019s conversation, she suddenly realized that the acceptance of a disciple wasn\u2019t as easy as how a Creation Master evolved a fey.The Moon Empress recalled her casual question to Lin Yuan. \u201cWhat is most important between a Master and disciple?\u201d\u201cAffection is the most important between a Master and disciple.\u201dLin Yuan\u2019s answer caused the Moon Empress to ponder carefully.Originally, the Moon Empress had been planning to accept Lin Yuan as a disciple today, but now, she didn\u2019t think it was that urgent anymore. Since the most important thing between a Master and disciple was affection, it was something that had to be accumulated through time and slowly formed.At that moment, the Moon Empress heard footsteps.Cold Moon walked into the inner palace and saw the Moon Empress, who was swirling the lotus lake\u2019s water and seemed to be considering something. At the same time, she didn\u2019t see Lin Yuan.Cold Moon silently thought,\u00a0Is the Moon Empress not satisfied with Lin Yuan?Just as Cold Moon was trying to guess the Moon Empress\u2019 thoughts, she heard the Moon Empress asking softly, \u201cCold Moon, do you think that after standing in a high place for a long time, we should learn to consider problems from the angle of an ordinary person?\u201dSurprise replaced Cold Moon\u2019s regularly cold expression due to the Moon Empress\u2019 question. Cold Moon thought deeply and replied, \u201cI feel that after a person becomes formidable, they should consider problems from the angle of an expert.\u201dCold Moon\u2019s answer was what the Moon Empress was thinking.For a person to become an expert, they had to go through hardships and overcome obstacles, as well as toil for long hours and experience difficulties, along with outstanding talent.In this world, experts represented special rights. Why would they lower their statuses to consider matters as an ordinary person? Wasn\u2019t it better to consider matters in a simpler and more direct manner as an expert?The Moon Empress stood up, and all the water from the lotus lake slid off her white jade hands before returning back to the lake.Cold Moon saw the Moon Empress shaking her head and smiling. \u201cYour ideals are right and also wrong. Cold Moon, bring a spiritual ingredient recipe book for me. Since affection is needed to accept a disciple, then I shall start with the simplest action!\u201dCold Moon\u2019s mouth opened so wide that she could actually swallow an egg.\u00a0What? Did I hear wrongly!? The Moon Empress is actually going to cook a meal, and it is to nurture the affection of the master-disciple relationship between her and Lin Yuan!? When has the Moon Empress made a meal before? This is simply too surreal!It was impossible that the Moon Empress was unsatisfied with Lin Yuan\u2014she was simply too satisfied with Lin Yuan. However, Cold Moon didn\u2019t understand why it was so complicated to accept a disciple. Wasn\u2019t just a single statement from the Moon Empress enough?When Lin Yuan was getting extremely bored by being so reserved in the room, he heard two clear and distinct voices from outside his pavilion. \u201cLord Lin Yuan, we are here on the Moon Empress\u2019 orders to deliver a change of clothes for you and also to prepare the hot water in the pavilion\u2019s bath.\u201dAfter hearing the voices outside the door, Lin Yuan allowed the duo to enter. It was two young girls, who were of similar age to him, with bright eyes and white teeth. They were both wearing light yellow robes.However, it was obvious that one of them had exquisite makeup while the other didn\u2019t have much makeup. The pavilion\u2019s bath was connected to an underground hot spring. During normal times, the spring\u2019s mouth would be sealed up. When it was time to use it, the spring\u2019s mouth would be opened up, and spring water of a perfect 40\u00b0C would flow out.After the preparations, the young girl with the exquisite makeup looked at Lin Yuan with glittering eyes and handed him the spirit qi clothes. \u201cLord Lin Yuan, do you need me to help you bathe and change your clothes?\u201d she asked softly.Lin Yuan quickly shook his head and said, \u201cI can do it myself.\u201dThe young girl with the exquisite makeup looked rather disappointed. \u201cThen we shall dismiss ourselves for now, Lord Lin Yuan.\u201dThe two young girls headed to the pavilion and did some simple cleanup.Lin Yuan observed and noticed that the young girl with the exquisite makeup had been standing beside him and trying to open up a conversation topic. On the other hand, the young girl without much makeup was doing all the work, and she was obviously exhausted after unsealing the restriction on the spring\u2019s mouth.These two young girls were wearing robes that were light yellow in color. Earlier on, the Moon Empress had given Lin Yuan a simple introduction to the Leaning Moon Mountain departments.These young girls with light yellow robes should be part of the Radiant Moon Palace\u2019s spirit attendants. These spirit attendants were all rather talented individuals among the young generation of Creation Masters, and they were all young females.These spirit attendants should have equivalent status, but it was obvious that one was bullying the other. Even if this was the cause, Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t interfere. After all, any place with humans would be a harsh world.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: Cleansing All the Impurities and TransformingWhen in the harsh world, it was hard to say that one didn\u2019t have any choice, but being able to excel would be dependent on one\u2019s own capability. It was naturally easy to do well if one was capable, but if one wasn\u2019t capable, it was natural to do badly.However, those that could be chosen as spirit attendants were definitely people with great talents. Nonetheless, this situation was truly something that Lin Yuan didn\u2019t expect.Lin Yuan didn\u2019t wish to bathe in the hot spring yet, so he stood by the window at the pavilion. The pavilion window was opened, and the sky was already turning dark as a new moon was gradually rising up.Lin Yuan never expected to actually see such a scene by the window. The two spirit attendants that were helping to tidy up the pavilion were standing near the pavilion and talking about something.They were rather far, and Lin Yuan couldn\u2019t really see their expressions clearly, however, the wind blowing in the pavilion carried their conversation into Lin Yuan\u2019s ears.\u201cWen Yu, if you spread the things that I said to Lord Lin Yuan today, I shall let you pay the price if I get punished!\u201d The young girl was speaking with a threatening voice, and it was unlike the pleasant voice within the pavilion earlier.\u201cJin Qi, the words you said earlier clearly aren\u2019t part of the Moon Empress\u2019 intentions. When has the Moon Empress asked you to help with the bathing and changing of clothes? What are you planning with such intentions!\u201dLin Yuan could vaguely see Jin Qi pushing Wen Yu. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to bother about what plans I have. If I can get myself involved with the lord in this pavilion, my status will be better than a spirit attendant. If you don\u2019t wish to progress, it is your problem!\u201d\u201cI do wish to progress, but I know what I can do and what I cannot do!\u201dAfter hearing the statement, an angered voice echoed. \u201cYou know what you can do and what you cannot do? Then why did your fey\u2019s roots get injured when you were rescuing others? You spent half a year just to recover, and during this half a year, we are all becoming Class 2 Creation Masters. You are just an intermediate Class 1 Creation Master and far behind us. Half a year later, it will be the spirit attendant test, and you shall be eliminated. You will not even fit to stay on the Leaning Moon Mountain.\u201dThe voice was dying down, but the wind carried all the words into Lin Yuan\u2019s ears. After hearing the voice, Lin Yuan had a subtle feeling that there was an unknown personality hidden in darkness.If the personality was hidden in the heart, how could anyone open up the heart to see if the person was kind- or evil-hearted?Lin Yuan closed the window and turned to walk toward the hot spring.The hot spring washed off all the dirt and fatigue, but it couldn\u2019t cleanse off the impurities that filled the body.At that moment, Lin Yuan saw Cold Moon walking inside and holding a massive green jade bowl. \u201cThis is the Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar prepared by the Moon Empress. This huge bowl contains the quantity of two portions. You just have to finish half of it. Drinking more would just be a waste.\u201dAfter speaking, Cold Moon left. Until now, Cold Moon was still in a rather shocked state as she couldn\u2019t understand why the Moon Empress treated Lin Yuan so well.It was extremely common to give precious treasures. Cold Moon wouldn\u2019t have such a feeling even if the Moon Empress gave the most precious treasure. But the Moon Empress was spending time and effort to make a meal for Lin Yuan. What did such an action prove? It was already evident.It proved that the Moon Empress was really treating Lin Yuan as a big deal and was already treating him as her disciple.When this huge bowl of amber-colored Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar was placed in front of Lin Yuan, it didn\u2019t have any smell. The more precious an item was, it would always be more reserved. The Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar might not have any smell, but it was because all the essence was locked within the nectar.After seeing this huge bowl of nectar meant for two portions, Lin Yuan\u2019s heart felt a sudden warmth. He felt as though he could feel the Moon Empress\u2019 intention. Since only one portion of the nectar was going to be useful, then the other portion could be saved up to help a person that was closest to Lin Yuan. That person was none other than Chu Ci.For such a precious treasure that could eliminate the body\u2019s impurities and enhance a person\u2019s foundation, Lin Yuan would probably reserve half the bowl for Chu Ci, even if it was a small bowl. It was obvious that the Moon Empress had actually thought of this possibility.All of a sudden, Lin Yuan\u2019s mind popped out with a saying, \u201cLove me, love my dog.\u201dHowever, Lin Yuan quickly shook his head.\u00a0The Moon Empress doesn\u2019t know Chu Ci, so it isn\u2019t suitable for the saying of \u2018Love me, love my dog.\u2019 As such, the Moon Empress is just being considerate to me.Lin Yuan discerned the feeling of being cared for by a senior, and it was a little bittersweet as Lin Yuan recalled about his parents, Auntie Zhang, and Uncle Li. These people had always helped Lin Yuan without asking for anything in return, and they were genuinely helping out. It was similar for the Moon Empress.Lin Yuan believed that he didn\u2019t have anything he could use to repay the Moon Empress. The Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar was a precious treasure, and the reactions from Elder Du and Elder Meng were enough to know of its value. Such a big bowl of Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar would definitely be worth 500 drops.Lin Yuan could work hard for several years and still wouldn\u2019t be able to afford this bowl of Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar. In addition, there were only two Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassias in the world, and they were exclusive to the Moon Empress.It meant that the Moon Empress was doing all these as a Master. Although she might not have officially accepted Lin Yuan as a disciple, she was already doing what a Master should do.As such, an indescribable feeling bloomed in Lin Yuan. Was it warmth or being touched? Or was it something else?In any case, in Lin Yuan\u2019s opinion, the Moon Empress wasn\u2019t just a Class 5 Creation Master who stood at the top. She was a senior that gave a trace of warmth.The Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar could cleanse the body\u2019s impurities and raise the body\u2019s constitution. Thus, Lin Yuan simply drank down half the bowl of nectar.When the Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar entered the throat, it had a concentrated sweetness that was refreshing, and it also contained the fragrance from an osmanthus. When the nectar that wasn\u2019t very viscous entered the belly, the base of the tongue produced this unique bitterness from herbs.When the bitterness faded, an immediate sweet aftertaste replaced it. It allowed his mouth to relive the refreshing sweetness of the Silver Stamen Gold Luster Cassia nectar.Soon enough, Lin Yuan felt his body getting hot.His skin started to secrete massive amounts of oil. The oil wasn\u2019t the color of the regular yellow oil, but it was dark red with spots of black. Once these oils emerged, Lin Yuan could smell an unbearable stench.Lin Yuan immediately entered the hot spring again to rub and wash off the impurities.It was fortunate that the mouth of the spring was unsealed, and the water was constantly flowing. Otherwise, the massive amount of impurities would have turned the spring water into foul-smelling water.After washing for more than two hours, Lin Yuan finally realized that his body had stopped secreting the nauseating impurities.These impurities were in the body from the moment a person was born. When a person ate more grains, the impurities would accumulate. For ordinary people, having too many impurities would cause incurable diseases. For spirit qi professionals, these impurities would affect their foundation and their cultivation speed.Lin Yuan circulated his spiritual power and realized that his spiritual power circulation was faster by 30%. This was truly a pleasant surprise for Lin Yuan.Immediately after, Lin Yuan suddenly noticed his hand, and he got an instant shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
