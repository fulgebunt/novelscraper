It is very rich. The Grand Canal, which spans from the south of the Yangtze River to the capital city, also crosses He Cheng County, making it very prosperous. Hexi Village is close to the county town, making the villagers\u2019 lives naturally very good.Today is a big day for Jiang Chengxiang, the third son of Jiang\u2019s family, a wealthy household in Hexi Village. The village is even more lively.The Jiang family sits on 15 mu of good paddy fields, 10 mu of fine mulberry forest, plus 10 mu of dry land. Old Jiang very skilled at butchering pigs and sheep, so the life of a family is naturally not bad.You know, Hecheng County is not a sparsely populated area. There are many people but little land, but the land is fertile. Because the rivers cross it vertically and horizontally and are not far from the sea, there are no droughts or floods. Generally speaking, as long as you are willing to take care of the land, the harvest in the field will not be bad. Usually, people that have seven or eight mu of paddy fields plus a few mu of dry land can already achieve a good life.The Jiang\u2019s third child studied in the county school. Although he did not even pass the entrance examination for young students, he found a good job two years ago because of his literacy. He went to work at the county pier every day. As long as he recorded how many bags of rice and pieces of clothes were carried by laborers on the dock, he could be paid two or three times as much as these laborers.Because he gained a little face, he can introduce the men of the village as a laborer on the dock in their spare time, and he has a lot of prestige in the village.Today, for Jiang\u2019s third son wedding, one after another, the people in the village took their best tables, chairs, bowls, and chopsticks to the Jiang family so that the Jiang family could hold the wedding with dignity. There was not enough space in the Jiang residence, so some families also gave their own family halls to assist them in welcoming their guests.Dressed in a brand-new red robe adorned with big red flowers on his chest, Jiang third son, with a high-spirited appearance, welcomed Zhu Shufen, the youngest daughter of the Zhu Xiucai family, back from the neighboring village.Zhu Shufen is the daughter of the scholar, and she is very good-looking. All the men in the village were envious that Jiang\u2019s third son was able to marry her. The people who spoke to Jiang third son came forward one after another to congratulate him, and the joy on Jiang\u2019s third son\u2019s face added to him a few more points.The wedding was very lively and respectable. The Jiang family killed two pigs yesterday and bought back a lot of fish. There was a bowl of pork, a bowl of pig blood soup, a bowl of pig\u2019s tail and a bowl of steamed fish on each table plus a lot of seasonal vegetables. The tables are full.There are thirty tables for the Jiang family\u2019s relatives and friends, as well as for the people who came to help from the village. After the lunch, there is another meal in the evening, making the atmosphere lively.A relative of Jiang\u2019s family grabbed some tea leaves and put it in a bowl. With a gourd ladle, he scooped a spoonful of boiling water from the iron pot, washed the tea, and looked at the smiling old man standing by the tea bowl. \u201cUncle Jiang, where\u2019s Eldest Jiang? His brother got married. Why haven\u2019t we seen him? \u201cThe families in the village get married early, and there are no shortage of grandparents in their thirties. They generally looked older, looking like in their forties or fifties, and they could be regarded as long lived when they reach their sixties and seventies. But old man Jiang is still very strong and stands tall although he is nearly fifty years old. When he heard someone ask about the eldest son, his brows wrinkled. His eldest son was a good worker. At this time, he should be at home to help. Why hadn\u2019t he seen him today?Puzzled, old man Jiang went to the kitchen to find his mother-in-law. \u201cMother, where\u2019s the eldest one?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he fall into the river a few days ago? He became ill. I asked him to go to the old house at the western end of the village, \u201d Old Madam Jiang said. Her drooping eyes were full of dissatisfaction. \u201cEven if he falls into the water, he should have been better after three or four days. I think he is just lazy. After today, I will take good care of him!\u201dOld man Jiang was not in charge of family affairs, and he was also very displeased with the eldest Jiang. When he heard his mother-in-law say so, he frowned. \u201cThat unproductive bastard!\u201dOld man Jiang reprimanded the eldest Jiang and soon left him behind. He got busy with Jiang third son marriage.Everyone celebrated the happy event in a lively manner, completely forgetting the eldest son Jiang, who had never had much presence.In the western part of Hexi Village, there are several dilapidated houses where the Zhao family, that has a very bad life in Hexi Village, resides in a piece of land, which is next to the Jiang family. The dilapidated dirt house was handed down by the old generation of Jiang\u2019s family. The House is so run-down that it has long been uninhabitable. But right then, a man was inside, lying on the ground.When Jiang Zhen woke up, he felt dizzy and felt a pain in his stomach.For a moment, he could not see what was around him. He blinked several times before his vision became a little clearer, Then he saw the broken roof and shining sun through the hole.Wasn\u2019t he dead? How can he feel the cold and pain again?Even if he had survived, he should have been in the hospital by now. How could he lie in such a dirty and messy place?Jiang Zhen instinctively felt that something was wrong. He wanted to jump up from the ground, but he couldn\u2019t even move.Jiang Zhen almost fainted again because of his heavy body and severe stomachache. At that moment, his head ached and some memories that did not belong to him suddenly poured into his mind.The memories belong to an ancient man.This ancient man, like him, was surnamed Jiang, but his name was not Jiang Zhen. They called him Jiang Zhenwei. He was the eldest son of the family, and the villagers generally called him Eldest Jiang. He was born on the fifth day of May. May is the evil month. This day is ominous. Therefore, the term, 'suppressing evil,\u201d is used on this day to stave it off.It is said that children born on this day will interfere with their parents, and eldest Jiang indeed \u201cinterfered\u201d with his parents.The day before Eldest Jiang was born, old man Jiang was taken away for military service. His parents were no longer alive at that time, and Lady Jiang\u2019s family was far away, so she had to give birth alone at home. It was difficult to give birth to her first child by herself; she almost lost her life that night.After birth, old Lady Jiang remained unattended and was hungry for a day. After that, she had to get up to cook and clean the soiled clothes and bedding. She couldn\u2019t sit for a month at all.She never knew how difficult it was, being alone at home and having to take care of a child. From the beginning, Madam. Jiang did not like her eldest son and decided that her eldest son was a star of suffering.It\u2019s just that old man Jiang left for military service, and he was bound to die outside. At that time, if the child died, Madam. Jiang would certainly be driven out of the house by Jiang\u2019s uncle and he would seize the field. Although she wished she could drown Eldest Jiang, Mrs. Jiang still pinched her nose to feed him.But it\u2019s only limited to feeding.Mrs. Jiang often beat and scolded Eldest Jiang. She ate and drank well but only gave him a mouthful of leftover food. When she went out to work, she tied the eldest Jiang to a straw rope at home. She never wanted to touch this star of suffering.When old man Jiang returned from military service five years later, the eldest Jiang, who was already five years old, was thin and small and could not even talk.When old man Jiang came home, life became easier for the Jiang family. Old man Jiang brought back some money to buy land, and he would butcher pigs and sell them at home during the holidays. Old men Jiang was still a good silkworm farmer. In the end, the Jiang family finally became the richest family in the village.But for Eldest Jiang, life was no easier.Old man Jiang has always been concerned with his work regardless of his family\u2019s affairs. He would not interfere with the disobedient children disciplined by his wife, and Eldest Jiang, who can\u2019t speak clearly, did not please him at all.One year after old Jiang came back, the second son in the Jiang family was born. Two years later, the third member of the Jiang family was also born, and two years later, a little Jiang sister was born. These three children were born and raised by old man Jiang. He loved them very much. What about old lady Jiang? When she gave birth to three more children, her family was doing well enough that they can eat and dress warmly. Old man Jiang even hired an old woman in the village to wait on her. She live a comfortable life and fell in love with these three children.For a long time, the second brother, the third brother and the Jiang sister were the darlings of the Jiang family, but the eldest boss is the existence that the Jiang family dislikes.At a young age, Eldest Jiang had to take his brother and sister and work in the field. That\u2019s not all. Madam Jiang was even reluctant to let him have enough to eat. If they had eggs and fish at home, he would never have a share.Because he was beaten and scolded and squeezed out of the family from an early age, the oldest Jiang child became quieter and quieter. He only knew how to bury his head in his work. Because of this, when he was sixteen or seventeen years old, he was basically doing all the farmwork for the family.He was diligent and did a good job with the farmwork, and the Jiang family still had money, so naturally, some people were willing to act as a matchmaker for him. But old man Jiang had the money to send the second and third brothers to go to the county town to study, and he also had the money to make new clothes for the Jiang little sister, but he did not have the money for the eldest Jiang to marry. This wasted time lasted for 10 years.This day, the eldest Jiang is 26 years old and is one of the oldest bachelors in Hexi Village. When a man in the countryside has not gotten a wife at this age, he can\u2019t expect to marry a woman for the rest of his life.Eldest Jiang became more and more silent and had not said a few words in a year. In addition to working and sleeping, like an invisible man, the rest of the Jiang family had a prosperous life.Jiang\u2019s second son married his wife two or three years ago, and now, he has a son. Jiang\u2019s third son is eighteen this year, and today he is getting married. The Jiang\u2019s daughter is sixteen years old. Countless people for ten miles and eight townships want to marry her.And eldest Jiang is dead.Madam Jiang had him prepare a lot of things for the third Jiang son\u2019s marriage. A few days ago, Madam Jiang asked the eldest Jiang to catch fish. Eldest Jiang can do farmwork. He learned to kill pigs with Mr. Jiang, but he knew nothing about catching fish. When he was young, he didn\u2019t have a chance to play like crazy like the other children in the village. He couldn\u2019t swim and fish at all. But he dared not ignore Madam Jiang\u2019s words and went into the water after all.While catching fish, the eldest Jiang accidentally fell on the water and nearly lost his life. Later, someone in the village saw him and saved him, but he developed a high fever the next day.If anyone in the Jiang family had a fever, even if they did not invite a doctor, they could rest in the house and eat good eggs and fine grain served to them. But when the eldest Jiang had a fever, Madam Jiang asked the unlucky second son was asked to use his cart to push him into an abandoned house of the Jiang family and he was left alone.Jiang burned with fever so badly and he was thrown into a ventilated room, and that was all. Madam. Jiang was so busy preparing for the third son\u2019s wedding that she forgot to deliver food to the eldest Jiang.Eldest Jiang starved to death.He was hungry before, when he was catching fish, and he was hungry for three days in that worn-down house. The dripping water from the roof did not reach him, so he starved to death.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2 - That boy is handsomePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2 \u2013 That boy is handsomeReceiving such memories, Jiang Zhen felt extremely constricted and had a nauseous feeling that he could not swallow or spit out.This Jiang family is really annoying. While giving all his family\u2019s work to this Eldest Jiang, they can still curse at him and think that he is the star of suffering.Jiang Zhenwei was so evil that, as a 26-year-old man, he was crushed to such an extent that he didn\u2019t even know how to resist! They know he\u2019s doing all the work at home. Can\u2019t even he get some food to eat and fill his stomach? Even if you don\u2019t put up a fight, nowadays, when you are so hungry and someone passes you by, cry out for help so you will not lose your life!Jiang Zhen, who was always unwilling to suffer losses, could not understand Eldest Jiang\u2019s actions, but after a moment of anger, he became silent.He guessed that this Eldest Jiang did not want to put up a fight and was, as a result, forced to suffer problems within his mind. That should be the case.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know much about mental illnesses, but after careful consideration, he found that many of the symptoms Eldest Jiang exhibited were similar to depression, which was often mentioned.Jiang Zhen, a rough old man who had lived for a long time, could not understand the feelings of \u201cdepression,\u201d but he was not unfamiliar with psychological problems. He had even seen a psychiatrist himself.In the past, he was in the special forces. When he was on a mission, he was used to have a lot of blood on his hands, and his life was different from that of ordinary people. When he retired from the army, he was afraid that people like him would have problems when they returned to ordinary society directly. So he asked the psychiatrist to chat with him and help him adapt to normal life. He had to say that those psychiatrists are really useful. At least, he was not so violent when they brought him back into society.It was also the psychiatrists who helped Jiang Zhen understand psychological problems.Eldest Jiang had not said a word in a year. He was silent. He was starving to death and did not cry for help. It was clear that he had psychological problems. He didn\u2019t want to live anymore.Also, forced by family members to become like this, how can normal people want to live?Jiang Zhen was a little annoyed at the thought of this, but at the moment, he had no time to think about Eldest Jiang\u2019s matters. He just wanted to live now.While he was rescuing people before, he had received two bullet wounds and several knife wounds. But he didn\u2019t go to see the King of Yama. Now he has a chance to live again. Vaguely hearing a voice outside, Jiang Zhen immediately began to cry for help. \u201cHelp!\u201dHe was so thirsty that he was unable to move his throat, and this body had not spoken for a long time. Jiang Zhen\u2019s voice was not very loud. It was so small and hoarse that he was disgusted with himself.But soon, there was a deep but very pleasant voice outside, asking, \u201cWho is it?\u201dAs the voice rang out, the other person marched towards the house. At the sound of his footsteps, Jiang Zhen breathed a sigh of relief and lay on the ground peacefully without any further struggle.The broken-down house had no doors at all, so it was blocked by reeds tied together and opened as soon as it was pushed. After the visitors pushed the reeds in, Jiang Zhen saw the other person\u2019s appearance.It was a young man in his early twenties. He was very tall, dressed in coarse cloth, dark but handsome with thick eyebrows and big eyes; and he had a deep scar on his brow, which added to his manliness . . . He is Jiang Zhen\u2019s favorite type of man.That\u2019s right. Jiang Zhen likes men. Unfortunately, he was embroiled in the army his entire past life. He couldn\u2019t hit on his brothers. Later, he died not long after he retired from the army, so he could not find himself a companion.\u201cGive me something to eat.\u201d Jiang Zhen took a look at the other\u2019s appearance and weakly asked for help. Although the man\u2019s looks was to his taste, right now, he wanted something that could fill his stomach.\u201cEldest Jiang? Why are you here?\u201d Zhao Jinge looked at the man lying on the ground and frowned. \u201cToday is the day the Jiang\u2019s third son is getting married, you . . . \u201d Jiang\u2019s family is very lively nowadays. Why is Jiang Zhenwei lying alone in a broken house?\u201cGive me something to eat,\u201d Jiang Zhen said again. He was so dizzy that he almost fainted again.Zhao Jinge also saw that Jiang Zhen\u2019s situation was not quite right. After taking a look at Jiang Zhen\u2019s clothes, his voice became even angrier. \u201cAre you still wearing the clothes you were wearing when you fell into the water? Your family . . .\u201d He looked at Jiang\u2019s crumpled clothes and the dilapidated hut before him and thought that, even though he had been beaten in the head and bleeding, he had never shouted in pain. But now he asked for food at his own initiative. . . He couldn\u2019t help sighing.\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten anything these days?\u201d Zhao Jinge picked up Jiang Zhen from the cold and wet mud and quickly placed him on a pile of straw inside the thatched hut. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019ll get you something to eat.\u201dAfter that, Brother Zhao Jinge left without looking back.He moved so fast that the man had disappeared in the blink of an eye, but Jiang Zhen was relieved. He found out from the memory of Eldest Jiang who this man was and knew that he would not deceive him.That man is called Zhao Jinge, a child of the Zhao family living near the thatched cottage. It was Zhao Jinge who saved Eldest Jiang after he fell into the water. Unfortunately, he saved the Eldest Jiang\u2019s life, and in a twinkling of an eye, it was ruined by the Jiang family. Eldest Jiang was dizzy and could not move. The Jiang family did not even change his clothes. As a result, how could he not have a fever?After Jiang Zhen remembered Zhao Jinge\u2019s identity, he had a better impression of him, but he went further along the memory of Eldest Jiang. And suddenly, he learned something extraordinary.He crossed over, but not to any of the dynasties he knew. The place where he is right now is called Daqi, and it has existed for hundreds of years that ordinary people, who have not gone to school, are completely unaware of the previous dynasties and of the war. Of course, that is not the point.The point is . . . in addition to men and women, there is another kind of person in this place known as ger.According to the birth population, about 50% are men, about 40% are women, and the remaining 10% are the ger.They look the same as men, but they have a cinnabar mole between their eyebrows. They are much weaker than men. They are as small as women and can have children like women.Because of this, for a long time, gers are raised like women, raised to marry, and their status in Daqi is the same as that of women.And this Brother Zhao Jinge is a ger.Some men can have children in this place . . . It must be said that Jiang Zhen was shocked. He learned about Zhao Jinge through Eldest Jiang\u2019s memory.Zhao Jinge\u2019s father, Zhao Fugui, is an ordinary farmer in Hexi Village. He married a woman surnamed Liu from the same village. His life was not good or bad. He had two children in total. His eldest son, Zhao Jinhu, is a man, and his second son, Zhao Jinge, is a ger.Zhao Jinge\u2019s parents fell sick when he was a child, but with his brother, life was very good. When he was six or seven years old, his parents had already told him to have a good marriage. Although it was much more difficult for a ger to have children than women, it was not easy for a countryman to have a wife. Even the gers are scrambled after.However, in this world, there are always all sorts of accidents.Zhao Jinge\u2019s brother, Zhao Jinhu, drowned when he was sixteen years old while swimming down the river. When he was fished out, he had already lost his breath for some time.The son, who had grown up, has disappeared. Zhao Fugui and his wife have been hit hard. Liu became even more ill and nearly died. In their helplessness, the Zhao family could only sell the few acres of land they own to treat Liu\u2019s illness.The Zhao family\u2019s lifestyle has fallen sharply. At that time, the family that had been engaged to Zhao Jinge suddenly backed out from the engagement. The family\u2019s son had a good woman, and they would soon see the children. What\u2019s more, the Zhao family was in a very bad situation at that time, and they didn\u2019t want to marry such a drag.Zhao Jinge was only twelve years old at that time, and his brother was dead. Naturally, he couldn\u2019t do the same work as in the past. In order to support his family and cure his mother\u2019s illness, he followed Zhao to work everywhere. When he was busy with farming, Zhao would take him as a part-time worker.Generally, both of them are thin and small, just like women, but Zhao Jinge worked all day long and looked more and more like the men, being even stronger than ordinary men.After the death of his eldest son, Zhao Fugui thought it would be easy to recruit a man for Zhao Jinge to go with them and continue the Zhao family line.Families with many sons in the countryside are often unable to arrange a daughter-in-law for every son. Men who have not given their family a daughter-in-law will work at home all their lives, In the future, they will be given to the children of their brothers. They will not have a warm bed, and yet, if they are too old to do anything, they will probably be driven out by their nephews. Compared to being an old bachelor, many men are more willing to go to other people\u2019s homes, even though their children will not bear their surnames, they are their own children. And then, they can sleep with a wife in their arms!Therefore, although it\u2019s a bit disgraceful to become a son-in-law, there are still many old bachelors willing to become son-in-laws, even those with better family backgrounds. Some poor male bachelors at home take the initiative to find a person to choose. The shame of being a son-in-law is better than being hungry at home.However, the Zhao family is not well-off. Zhao Jinge is not a woman. He is a ger who looks like a man.Most men still like women. It\u2019s not impossible to see a couple like Zhao Jinge, but Zhao\u2019s family is still very poor. Since they still go hungry after joining Zhao\u2019s family and there are no women to warm their beds, those old bachelors are naturally reluctant to join Zhao family.Zhao Jinge left it like that.Last year, Zhao Jinge, 24, who is old and single, living in the countryside, knows that he has no hope of marrying a man. He can\u2019t marry for his parents. He simply cut off his cinnabar mole with a knife, and completely treated himself as a man. This year, he went to a rich family to work as a longtime laborer. Though earning money, since his mother, Zhao Liu, remains in poor health. from time to time, he has to spend some money on medicine. His family will also always lack money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They grow potatoes and vegetables, and their house is right next to this place.Zhao Jinge stepped into the house and smelled the aroma of food. At the same time, his mother, Zhao Liu, also welcomed him home. \u201cJinge, you are back?\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t have any work to do today, so I came back first.\u201d Zhao Jinge said that he had done almost all the work, so he had spoken to his employer and came back early. He planned to turn over his land and plant something in the afternoon.\u201cJinge, you\u2019ve worked hard.\u201d Zhao Liu looked at her youngest son\u2019s tough face and the deep scar on his eyebrow. She felt sad. If it wasn\u2019t for Jinhu, how would Jinge suffer so much?He\u2019s a ger who wants to support his family like a man.When Zhao Jinge saw his mother\u2019s appearance, he knew that she was thinking too much. He could not comfort people. He just said, \u201cMother, do you have anything to eat?\u201d\u201cYes. Mother made sweet potato porridge,\u201d Zhao Liu said, lifting the lid of the pot.In the pot is orange sweet potato porridge. The porridge is made with sweet potatoes and a bit of rice. As for the steamer rack, there is a large bowl of pickles.They usually eat two meals a day, and these are basically what they eat.Zhao Liu wanted to get a bowl for Zhao Jinge, but Zhao Jinge grabbed a big porcelain bowl first and filled the bowl with porridge. \u201cMother, I\u2019ll go out.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhao Liu asked puzzled.\u201cEldest Jiang asked me for something to eat.\u201d Zhao Jinge walked towards the door.Eldest Jiang, the one who hasn\u2019t spoken for years, still wants to eat? Zhao Liu\u2019s face showed her surprise, and she said, \u201cIsn\u2019t this Jiang family having a wedding? Will he have nothing to eat? The Jiang family gave meals when they invited their neighbors to help them prepare yesterday. The people who went there said that they had a very good meal. Why did Eldest Jiang want food from others?\u201d\u201cHe is lying there. I guess he hasn\u2019t eaten for days.\u201d Zhao Jinge pointed to the road that led to the broken-down thatched cottage about half a mile away from Zhao\u2019s house and strode over there after he had spoken.Zhao Liu was shocked when she heard her son\u2019s words. The dilapidated hut had not been inhabited for a long time. What had happened to Eldest Jiang, who had just fallen into the water a few days ago? Moreover, these days, she clearly had not heard anything, nor had she seen anyone coming from Jiang family.This Jiang family is too hard on Eldest Jiang.Zhao Liu couldn\u2019t help sighing, but by that time, Zhao Jinge had already carried the bowl inside the thatched hut.Jiang Zhen was very weak at the moment, barely supporting himself. When he saw Zhao Jinge return, he breathed a sigh of relief. He was finally saved.Zhao Jinge did not know Jiang Zhen\u2019s thoughts. He entered the house to support Jiang Zhen, and he placed the porridge bowl to his mouth.The sweet taste of sweet potatoes made Jiang Zhen want to eat the porridge in one bite, but considering his physical condition, in the end, he still ate slowly in small bites.The porridge was no longer hot, but it was still warm. Jiang Zhen felt like he had come back to life after the bowl of porridge was eaten.\u201cThank you.\u201d Jiang Zhen thanked Zhao Jinge for the bowl of sweet potato porridge and water, but it made his throat bitter.\u201cNo.\u201d Zhao Jinge watched Jiang Zhen drink up the porridge and immediately let Jiang Zhen go. He let Jiang Zhen lie in the hay pile and asked, \u201cWould you like me to help you go to Jiang\u2019s house?\u201dHearing the words, \u201cJiang house,\u201d Jiang Zhen felt a tightness in his chest. This sentiment does not belong to him, and it seems that Eldest Jiang is still unwilling.\u201cThey don\u2019t care about me.\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at Zhao Jinge again. \u201cThe Jiang family . . . what are they doing now?\u201d\u201cToday is your third brother\u2019s day of marriage,\u201d Zhao Jinge said with a puzzled look at Jiang Zhen. When Eldest Jiang mentioned Jiang family, he was too distant.\u201cI see. Thank you.\u201d Jiang Zhen once again thanked him.Zhao Jinge heard Jiang Zhen\u2019s thanks twice in succession. He was a little embarrassed and asked, \u201cAre you full? Shall I fetch you another bowl?\u201d\u201cNo. I\u2019ll go home after getting more rest,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. He couldn\u2019t eat so much at the moment.\u201cUm,\u201d Zhao Jinge answered, \u201cthen I\u2019ll go first.\u201dZhao Jinge left soon, and Jiang Zheng closed his eyes.Perhaps because of the fever, his eyes were so sore that even opening them was a burden. After closing them, he finally felt better.Jiang Zhen was powerless, but because of his strange experience, he was drowsy and wanted to fall asleep when he suddenly felt that the door had been opened again.He listened to the footsteps twice. He was already familiar with them. Who was it if it weren\u2019t Brother Zhao Jinge?After entering the house, Zhao Jinge\u2019s saw that Eldest Jiang was sleeping, his eyes closed. Zhao Jinge\u2019s footsteps could hardly be heard. He came to Jiang Zhen\u2019s side and covered him with some straw. He also laid bundles of straw around Jiang Zhen.Country people often rely on straw to warm themselves up in winter. When the bed is covered with thick straw, they regard it as a mattress. Zhao Jinge was afraid that Eldest Jiang was too cold to cover himself up.Zhao Jinge laid down the straw and left again. Jiang Zhen, however, could not help but find the memories of Zhao Jinge in his mind.Jiang Zhenwei, in fact, had originally thought of Zhao Jinge. Knowing that his parents would not let him marry, he wanted to go to the Zhao\u2019s house as a son-in-law and marry Zhao Jinge.His life in Jiang\u2019s family was very difficult, so he did not care about Zhao\u2019s family situation at all. Zhao Jinge was ugly, but he did not care. But although he had this idea, he could not speak or dare to speak. So until he died, nobody knew about this except himself.This Eldest Jiang\u2019s life is a bit of a mess . . . The more memories Jiang Zheng uncovered, the more annoyed he was. Instead, he did not care about those people in the Jiang family. As soon as he packs up his belongings, he would go directly to the Zhao family and rely on Zhao Jinge.Of course, that\u2019s a bit shameless . . . Jiang Zhen pondered that he still had to take good care of his health as soon as possible and then think about other things. Food is very important if he wants to be healthy.Jiang Zhen thought about what to do next, smelled the scent of straw, and finally fell asleep.When Jiang Zhen woke up again, it was already dark.He had been dying before, but after drinking a bowl of porridge and sleeping, he had recovered, but his hands and feet were still weak. . . This body\u2019s constitution is still good, but it had been through too much hardship before and it still falls short.Jiang Zhen took a deep breath and stood up and walked out of the hut.It\u2019s still cold that day. He doesn\u2019t want to spend the night in this thatched hut.With his memories as a guide, Jiang Zhen went all the way back to Jiang\u2019s house.Now it\u2019s very late, but the Jiang family is still awake. Jiang\u2019s family had been at its busiest with Jiang Chengxiang getting married. They waited until the wedding was over, and they tidied up their home again before they had time to sit down and eat together.After the banquet, Madam Jiang shared some of the various dishes they served to people who came to help them and kept a lot for herself. Now the food is being eaten by the whole family.\u201cLittle sister, don\u2019t you like chicken wings? Here you go.\u201d Madam Jiang clipped a chicken wing with chopsticks to give to Jiang Xiaomei and put two chicken legs in an empty bowl next to her. \u201cYuan Wen likes to eat chicken legs. I specially kept them hidden in the house and did not serve them on the table. I will give them to him when he wakes up tomorrow.\u201dYuan Wen is the only grandson in old lady Jiang\u2019s family. He is two years old. Since he was born, he has been the sweetheart of old Madam Jiang. Now he is asleep.Jiang Chengwen, the second eldest son of Jiang\u2019s family, put a piece of pork in his mouth with chopsticks and suddenly remembered. \u201cWhere is the eldest?\u201d Today, the third married. He was so busy that his feet had not touched the ground, but Eldest Jiang had not shown his face . . .Jiang Chengwen also studied for two years when he was a child, but he did not like reading and did not want to continue after two years. Since he had stopped studying, he was supposed to cultivate the fields, but Eldest Jiang was so capable that, even though he was now twenty years old, he could not do any work. He went to the fields only twice.Today, when Jiang Chengxiang got married, he just helped to lift the table and serve the dishes. He could not bear it. He could no longer stand it and complained about Eldest Jiang. If Eldest Jiang had been here, how could he be required to do these jobs?\u201cThe debt collector doesn\u2019t know where the hell you are going, so don\u2019t come back if you can!\u201d Old Madam Jiang said, her face with its drooping eye corners looked extremely mean.When Jiang Zhen entered the house, he happened to hear such a remark, and there was another burst of indignation in his heart.It was not his emotion. He would not get angry with such a remark.\u201cBig Brother?\u201d Jiang Xiaomei was the first to see Eldest Jiang.Among so many people in the Jiang family, Eldest Jiang\u2019s favorite is Jiang Xiaomei. Although Jiang Xiaomei likes to be lazy and delicate, she is the only person in the Jiang family that will take Eldest Jiang\u2019s opinion into account. For example, during the New Year\u2019s festival, the family has made some dumplings and other kinds of food. Madam Jiang refused to let Eldest Jiang eat them, and no one else would think of giving them to him to eat, but Jiang Xiaomei will take some to Eldest Jiang.Only Jiang Xiaomei would call Eldest Jiang as elder brother. Jiang\u2019s second and third eldest brothers had always directly called Eldest Jiang \u201cEldest.\u201dJiang Zhen took a look at Jiang Xiaomei, who was gnawing on chicken wings. His eyes fell on the other members of the Jiang family, and he remembered all their looks and demeanor.\u201cYou\u2019re dead, little beast! There\u2019s no one at home who\u2019s not busy!\u201d When old lady Jiang saw her eldest son come in quietly, she immediately cursed at him angrily.Jiang Zhen looked at her coldly. \u201cI had a fever. I spent three days lying in the thatched hut on the western side. I was hungry for three days, and no one delivered a meal.\u201dEldest Jiang used to bow his head all day, but Eldest Jiang looked up and revealed to them his appearance completely so that one could clearly see his thin face and cold eyes.Old Madam Jiang is cold-hearted when she looked at her eldest son. However, she does not care about his feelings and continued to curse at him, \u201cLittle bastard, you dare to talk back to me. You are such a big person, do you have to be fed?\u201dAs soon as old Man Jiang saw that Jiang Zhen looked haggard, he was still a little uncomfortable. But after hearing the scolding of old lady Jiang, he frowned again. His son has been acting strangely all day, and now he\u2019s blaming them? Even if you\u2019re hungry, don\u2019t you know how to squeak? Does such a big man need his parents to deliver meals to him?Madam Jiang continued to scold, and had she not been eating still, she would have found a stick to beat him with. But both Jiang couple and Jiang Xiaomei looked at Jiang Zhen in some surprise\u2014This man actually spoke? And such a long sentence?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4 - Scolding you to deathPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 4 \u2013 Scolding you to deathJiang Zhen turned a deaf ear to Madam Jiang\u2019s scolding, but once again he was clearly aware of Madam Jiang\u2019s position in this family.If Eldest Jiang was idle and lazy, it would be not surprising that he would be rejected by his family. But, as a matter of fact, most of the physical work in this family is being done by Eldest Jiang.Over the past two years, Eldest Jiang always felt that he was sore and his footsteps were heavy, and he could not keep up his spirits to do anything, but at the request of his parents, he still worked in the fields all day long. He never spoke, nor did he communicate with others. He had a hard and muddled life. The only consolation was that Jiang Xiaomei occasionally shouted, \u201cBrother,\u201d and paid a little attention to him.\u201cYou bastard . . .\u201d Old Madam Jiang was still cursing, but Jiang Zhen suddenly went forward and sat down at the table then took the chopsticks and began to eat.\u201cWho gave you permission to eat at the table?\u201d Old Madam Jiang was already angry, but when she saw Jiang Zhen sitting at the table, she became even more angry.By the way, for a long time. Eldest Jiang was not allowed to eat at the table. After everyone finished eating, and he washed the dishes and he ate some leftovers. Occasionally, when there were no leftovers, he was left hungry.Fortunately, when cooking in an iron pot, there is always a hard and unpleasant layer of scum, which kept Eldest Jiang from starving.Jiang Zhen could only eat with chopsticks and didn\u2019t listen to old Madam Jiang\u2019s words. Without taking his rice bowl, he only kept on eating vegetables. Because his body had not fully recovered, he didn\u2019t dare to eat too much meat, so he ate half-meat and half-vegetarian dishes.But old Madam Jiang could not stand it. She stood up and robbed Jiang Zhen of the dishes and chopsticks in his hand. \u201cThis dish is for tomorrow. Who allowed you to eat it?\u201dWith that, the thin old Madam Jiang also stood up and took a broom from the side to hit Jiang Zhen.When old Madam Jiang stood up, Jiang Zhen stood up with her . . . He took the big bowl with two chicken legs, and put a large bowl of rice into it from the rice bucket. He piled up the bowl to the top.\u201cBoss, what are you doing?\u201d Jiang Chengwen saw his eldest brother unexpectedly take the chicken leg left for his son to eat and frowned. As soon as his voice fell, he saw Jiang Zhen hold the bowl in one hand, grasped the corner of the table with the other, and directly overturned the table.The wooden eight Immortals table fell to the ground, the porcelain bowls on the table broke into several pieces, and the dishes were mixed on the ground.Jiang Xiaomei was stunned, chopsticks still in one hand and chicken wings in the other. Old Man Jiang, who was sitting opposite Jiang\u2019s boss, was the first to bear the brunt after the table was overturned. His clothes were covered with vegetable soup and oil, and he was so angry that he could not speak. Even old Madam Jiang, who was about to hit someone with a broom, froze.Eldest Jiang had always been quiet. They all thought that he would probably be beaten without saying a word.\u201cGoddamn it, you dared to lift the table. You turned against us!\u201d Old Madam Jiang, holding a broom, rushed to Jiang Zhen. There was a lot of good stuff on that table, and now she had lost half of her dishes and a lot of dishes were broken. She was so distressed that she could hardly breathe.Eldest Jiang would stand at her beck and call, but Jiang Zhen would not. He took the big bowl with two chicken legs and a bowl of rice, got rid of Old Madam Jiang and went into the Jiang family\u2019s storeroom where Eldest Jiang\u2019s resides.\u201cSon of a bitch, you\u2019re going against the sky!\u201d Old Madam Jiang chased him and was about to go into the storeroom to hit people, but Jiang Zhen has already bolted the door. How could Old Madam Jiang get in?She could not get in but was able to swear outside, and every word that sprang out of her mouth was like it was not her son in the room but the enemy who killed her family.But in fact, Jiang Zhenwei never hurt her.When Old Man Jiang went to join the army, it had nothing to do with him at all. Even if she hadn\u2019t given birth to Jiang Zhenwei, she might have been robbed of land by Uncle Jiang, because, after five years of military service, everyone thought her husband was dead.Later, Madam Jiang\u2019s life got better and better, and she could not get rid of her relationship with Eldest Jiang. Jiang Zhenwei was bent on making his mother treat him nicely and, so, listened to wherever she said.Listening to the sound outside, Jiang Zhen\u2019s heart burst into a sullen rush, which made him inevitably grumpy.With a sneer, Jiang Zhen pulled out a machete from the storeroom and opened the door in a few steps.\u201cLittle beast.\u201d When old Madam Jiang saw the door open, she opened her mouth to curse him but stopped abruptly.There was a knife, a big knife right in front of her face. In the dark light, it seems murderous. If she rushed forward quickly, she might have been cut in the face by the knife.\u201cYou scold. Keep scolding. Come on!\u201d Jiang Zhen took the knife and took a step forward with a sneer.Old Madam Jiang subconsciously drew back and looked at Jiang Zhen as if she had seen a ghost. \u201cYou, you . . .\u201d\u201cYou can continue to scold if you have the ability. Do you believe that I will not cut you to death?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at old Madam Jiang with ruthless eyes. In fact, he was quite violent. When he first retired from the army, he was bullied by a few short-sighted people. He always had the impulse to break other\u2019s necks. Thanks to the brainwashing education of psychiatrists in the army, they had been unable to kill civilians in order to protect the people, and he did not become a homicidal maniac and even lost his life in order to save people.Old Madam Jiang was arrogant at home, but she had not dared to point a knife at others. Now she saw Jiang Zhen holding the knife in a vicious manner. Her legs shook, and then her legs weakened, and she fell to the ground. For some reason, she felt that her son was really going to kill her.This little bastard!\u201cYou\u2019d better leave me alone!\u201d Jiang Zhen waved his knife, went back to the room with a cold hum, and slammed the door again, leaving only the rest of the Jiang family outside to look at his door in shock.This . . . This . . . Is this man still the honest Eldest Jiang?Old man Jiang was a butcher and was very strong. He had just been splashed with the dishes. He wanted to teach his eldest son a good lesson, but when he saw the knife and heard his son\u2019s cold voice, he didn\u2019t dare move.Jiang Chengwen; his wife, Huang Min, and Jiang Xiaomei were even more afraid to move and stood there foolishly.\u201cThat bastard . . .\u201d Old Madam Jiang was still in a state of shock, but when she opened her mouth, she cursed others, and after cursing, she could not help shaking.\u201cCough, well, today is the third wedding night. Let\u2019s not quarrel so that the third wife will not see this joke,\u201d old man Jiang said, looking at his second son. \u201cChengwen, you and your wife go back to your rooms. Don\u2019t wake Yuan Wen up with such a big noise.\u201dOld man Jiang gave old Madam Jiang a signal, and the frightened old Madam Jiang calmed down.She was so angry that she wanted to beat up her eldest son, but she was still afraid of what had just happened.Wait till tomorrow to clean up that little bastard! Old Madam Jiang got up from the ground and saw the mess in the hall. She was so sad that she quickly told Jiang Xiaomei, \u201cLittle sister, little sister! Go and pick up those dishes, especially the meat. They can still be eaten after we wash them!\u201dThe Jiang family was a rich family in Hexi Village, but they could not afford to live in a brick house. Their house was built with earth. Although the beams were covered with tiles on top, the ground below was still mud. Those dishes fell on the muddy ground and can\u2019t be eaten without washing.\u201cThere were only a few bowls in the family, and he broke several at once. Why doesn\u2019t the debt collector just die?\u201d Old Madam Jiang saw several pieces of broken porcelain bowls and only felt pain in her heart.Jiang Xiaomei was usually very popular at home, but this time, she did not dare to say a word. She silently tidied up the food that can be eaten and fed the pigs food that cannot be eaten. She followed Madam Jiang for most of the hour to wash the dishes before going to bed.Jiang family went to bed, and there was no movement outside. Jiang Zhen was finally able to sleep in peace.Just now, after driving Old Madam Jiang away and bolting the door, he collapsed to the ground. This body was really useless.It is most urgent to take good care of my health.There was no bed in the storeroom, but there was a lot of straw in the corner, and this was Eldest Jiang\u2019s bed.The land in the south of the Yangtze River is fertile, and every family grows rice. Apart from the Zhao family, which is so poor that they have to eat sweet potato every day, the average household has two meals of rice and porridge. The firewood used for cooking is mainly straw.The Jiang family had a lot of land and a lot of straw. Eldest Jiang dug a hole in the straw pile in the Jiang\u2019s storeroom and lived there. He would not freeze, but it was a little uncomfortable to sleep like this.Jiang Zhen has the memories of Eldest Jiang. After returning to the Jiang\u2019s house, he wanted to take the bed of the old Jiang couple. After all, old Madam Jiang would not treat herself badly, and their bed would be comfortable to sleep in. But he still didn\u2019t do that because Boss Jiang used to live in a grocery room with a knife, and for now, he needed to have enough deterrence.Old man Jiang was a butcher. He had two knives on hand. One was a sharp knife that is used to stab a pig in the neck. It was less than a foot long but two fingers wide. The other was a machete that could cut up pig bones. It was as thick and heavy like an axe. That knife is the one Jiang Zhen used to scare people.Jiang Zhen got into the thatched pile, put the knife beside him, and fell into a deep sleep. He only woke up when the light shone through the paper window.After a night\u2019s sleep, Jiang Zhen felt that his whole body was much more relaxed and stronger. He got out of the straw hole where he had laid several rags and slowly began to eat the bowl of rice he had picked up before he overturned the table yesterday.The ancient rice was not as clean as later generations, but the rice of the Jiang family was relatively good. On the other hand, Jiang Chenwen and Jiang Chenxiang did not like to eat brown rice, but the Jiang family raised several pigs. Brown rice can be used to feed pigs.Jiang Zhen slowly chewed the rice in the bowl, ate a chicken leg and almost swallowed all of it in one breath. Then he went to the stack of straw to continue to rest.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5 - Don\u2019t mess with mePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 5 \u2013 Don\u2019t mess with meJiang Zhen was resting inside the house, but outside, the rest of the Jiang family had already met their new daughter-in-law.There aren\u2019t many people who can write and read in the south of the Yangtze River, so it is very difficult for them to pass the scholar\u2019s examination. Jiang Chengxiang new wife, Zhu Shufen, is the daughter of a scholar, and her father, Zhu Xiucai, is expected to be elected in the examination. Because of this, the Jiang family attaches great importance to the marriage, not only paying a large amount of money to marry her but also holding her in high regard.But even so, Shufen was still not happy.Last night, she was trying to talk to her husband on her wedding night. There was a lot of noise outside. Her mother-in-law kept insulting her brother-in-law like a shrew.Even if her brother-in-law was out of his mind and could not speak or do things, her mother-in-law should be embarrassed to behave like that.After pursing her mouth, Shufen first looked down on old Madam Jiang, but she did not show it on her face. She still appeared gentle and courteous.\u201cShufen, I made you sugar eggs. Eat.\u201d Old Madam Jiang put a bowl in front of Zhu Shufen. Inside the bowl are two poached eggs boiled in brown sugar water.On the first day, Jiang Chengwen\u2019s wife, Huang Min, married into Jiang\u2019s family, she got up early in the morning to help old lady Jiang cook, but she did not get to eat sugar eggs. Now that she saw the treatment of her sister-in-law, she could not help but feel a little angry. But old lady Jiang did not pay attention to her and invited Zhu Shufen to eat meat. She also complained again about Jiang Zhen. \u201cThe table was overturned yesterday, and all the good dishes fell on the floor. I had to wash them and cook them again . . .\u201dZhu Shufen wanted to stretch out her chopsticks to eat chicken, but when she heard this, she took them back. Yesterday, her mother-in-law scolded for a long time, and she understood the context. She lost her appetite when she thought that the things on the table had been picked up from the ground.Zhu Shufen didn\u2019t want to eat anything at the table anymore. She used the chopsticks to eat the eggs in her bowl. At the same time, she felt like complaining again. There was too little sugar in the sugar water, and the sugar was not sweet enough. As for the eggs . . .Zhu Shufen took a bite, the uncooked egg yolk flowed out, and her face changed. \u201cWhy is this egg not cooked? As I said before, I like cooked egg.\u201dZhu Shufen knew Jiang Chengxiang before her marriage. Jiang Chengxiang would send her something from time to time. At that time, he sent her boiled eggs, and once, Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s eggs were not boiled thoroughly. She told Jiang Chengxiang that she did not like to eat eggs that were raw and uncooked.After that, all the eggs sent by Jiang Chengxiang were well-cooked, but how could they bring her such eggs today?\u201cHalf-cooked egg tastes better,\u201d old Madam Jiang said. The third had told her that his wife wanted to eat well-cooked eggs, but poached eggs would use more firewood to fully boil, so she took them out when they were almost done and packed them in a bowl.What\u2019s more, eggs are obviously more delicious. Jiang Xiaomei liked to eat half-cooked eggs. If she could eat an egg occasionally, she had to wait for her to prepare a meal before putting them on the steamer. She steamed them half-cooked with the hot air bellow.Zhu Shufen pushed the bowl in her hand to Jiang Chengxiang and refused to eat the sugar eggs.Old Madam Jiang regarded this scene with some disapproval and dissatisfaction but still said, \u201cShufen, if you do not like to eat them like this, I will cook for you a boiled egg later.\u201d\u201cEggs, eggs!\u201d Jiang Yuan Wen, the only grandson of the Jiang family, knocked his bowl with a spoon and asked old lady Jiang for food.\u201cThere must always be eggs for our family, Yuan Wen. Don\u2019t worry.\u201d Old Madam Jiang had always loved her grandson the most.Although there was a little unhappiness, everyone in the Jiang family was able to meet the new daughter-in-law.Zhu Shufen ate something then went back to her room with Jiang Chengxiang. Old Madam Jiang asked Jiang Xiaomei to tidy things together and asked, \u201cThe one who has jumped into the river hasn\u2019t come out yet?\u201dNo matter who Madam Jiang scolded, he was the only one who was called like that.\u201cI didn\u2019t see him come out,\u201d Jiang Xiaomei said. Thinking of what happened last night, she couldn\u2019t help but feel frightened.Old Madam Jiang was also frightened by what had happened last night. She didn\u2019t sleep well all night. Now she looked at the direction of the storeroom with a gloomy face. \u201cHe can never come out. It\u2019s best if he starves to death in it!\u201dIf Eldest Jiang was not feeling well before or was not busy with farming, he would occasionally lie motionless in the house for a day without eating or drinking. Jiang Zhen did not leave the storeroom after last night, which made Madam Jiang think of the past, and she was not very afraid of him.She is his mother. Does the guy who has no balls really dare to kill her?With this in mind, Madam Jiang wanted to go over and rattle the door again.\u201cMother.\u201d Just as Madam Jiang was about to teach her eldest son a lesson, the newlywed Jiang Chengxiang suddenly entered the kitchen.\u201cWhat is the third son doing here? This is no place for you men to come,\u201d Old Madam Jiang said, but she completely forgot that all the work in the kitchen, such as washing dishes and pots, was done by Eldest Jiang after he came back from the field.The only reason that Eldest Jiang didn\u2019t cook was because Old Madam Jiang was afraid he would steal food.\u201cMother, I have something to tell you,\u201d said Jiang Chengxiang. \u201cIn the future, when you make eggs for Shufen, they must be cooked. She doesn\u2019t like to eat uncooked eggs. In fact, she likes scrambled eggs best.\u201d\u201cShe is too choosy. Where can I get so much oil for her scrambled eggs?\u201d Old lady Jiang disgruntledly muttered. It is good enough to have eggs to eat, how much oil is needed for scrambled eggs? Eggs are already the greatest food!\u201cIsn\u2019t it alright to spoil her little in the family?\u201d Jiang Chengxiang smiled and said, \u201cThere is also big brother. Mother, don\u2019t always catch him and scold him all the time. It\u2019s so ugly. Yesterday, we heard your scolding from the bedroom. Although Shufen did not say anything, but I was very embarrassed. Her parents\u2019 arguments are usually as short as a single sentence.\u201d\u201cWhat is that?\u201d Old Madam Jiang frowned. \u201cShe will give me the cold-shoulder?\u201dOld Madam Jiang was told off by her son; her heart was on fire, and she was not happy with Zhu Shufen. But she thought that she is the daughter of Master Xiucai, so she needed to give her face. After that, she wanted to find trouble with her eldest son, but thinking about her daughter-in-law, she did not do so in the end. She just chattered on and on about the two chicken legs that were supposed to be left for Yuan Wen.However, thinking that Yuan Wen did not get to eat chicken legs, old Madam Jiang, who was rarely generous, steamed six eggs in one breath while cooking.When the meal was ready, Madam Jiang ate one by herself. When she arrived at the table, she gave Jiang Yuan Wen two eggs, Zhu Shufen two eggs, and the rest went to Jiang Xiaomei.Old man Jiang did not like to eat dry eggs and sat at the table, picking fat meat to eat. Huang Min looked at her brother-in-law and sister-in-law with jealousy. With mother-in-law staring at her, it was impossible for her to take a bite of the eggs her son was eating.\u201cAre you eating?\u201d The crowd was about to eat when a hoarse voice suddenly rang out.When the Jiang family looked over, they saw a tall, black, thin, and angry man coming towards them with a sharp knife attached to his waist and a big knife in his hand and looking at them menacingly.Old Madam Jiang subconsciously wanted to swear, but when she saw the knife in Jiang Zhen\u2019s hand, she could no longer make a sound in her throat. Old man Jiang was also a little stupefied, and the others were even more afraid to greet Jiang Zhen.Honest Eldest Jiang, how did he become like this in the twinkling of an eye?For a moment, there was no sound in the room.Jiang Zhen was very satisfied with this scene. When he saw that the eight members of the Jiang family had filled the eight seats next to the eight Immortals tables, he sneered at Jiang Chengwen. \u201cSecond son, make way.\u201dJiang Chengwen saw Jiang Zhenwei last night. When he heard Jiang Zhen\u2019s cold words, he subconsciously gave way and pulled away Huang Min, who was sitting next to him.Jiang Zhen sat down and put the knife on the table.This knife, which can easily cut off the bones of a pig\u2019s leg, was very heavy. When it was placed on the table, the whole table was in shock . . . Jiang Zhen pressed his left hand on it and did not let go, but his right hand took Jiang Chengwen chopsticks and picked the cooked vegetables to eat. Then he went on to eat Jiang Chengwen\u2019s bowl of rice.\u201cEldest Jiang, if you want to eat, why won\u2019t you take the bowl yourself?\u201d Old man Jiang killed pigs and had been a soldier who has seen the world. At that time, he finally came back to his senses and glared at Jiang Zhen, who had driven Jiang Chengwen away.Jiang Zhen simply buried his head into the bowl while eating and did not respond to the words of old man Jiang. His action made old men Jiang forget his fear last night.\u201cBastard, I\u2019m talking to you!\u201d Old man Jiang slapped his hands on the table, and the dishes on the table shook.\u201cYou son of a bitch, you give me so much trouble yesterday and still dare to eat at the table today. I will beat you to death!\u201d Old Madam Jiang went to find the broom again.\u201cEldest Jiang, what\u2019s the matter with you? Shufen has just married in. Can you stop making trouble?\u201d Jiang Chengxiang had not seen Jiang Zhen holding a knife last night. He was not afraid of Jiang Zheng at all. \u201cYou are too disgraceful!\u201dJiang Zhen ate very quickly, put three or two bowls of rice into his own mouth. After eating, he stood up.Why do these people like toasting instead of drinking fine wine?Standing up, Jiang Zhen suddenly picked up his knife and chopped the table. He only split one side of the wooden table: \u201cHave you forgotten what I said yesterday? Curse me again and I will cut you to death!\u201dThis time, the dishes on the table were not only shaken but were even directly overturned. Old man Jiang\u2019s rice bowl fell to the ground and broke in half.Old man Jiang was so angry when he stared at him. The new daughter-in-law was right next to him. He didn\u2019t want to show weakness, so he stood up and said, \u201cWho do you think you are? How dare you talk to your father like that?\u201dJiang Zhen looked at him coldly, pulled out his knife from the table, and while moving aside, cut off the broom handle held by old lady Jiang.The knife almost cut her own hand! Old Madam Jiang screamed uncontrollably. Jiang Zhen gave her a cold look but suddenly reached out and snatched the two eggs for Jiang Yuan Wen, who was sitting next to Jiang Xiaomei, and held them in his arms. Then he robbed the two eggs for Zhu Shufen. Finally, he took a look at Jiang Xiaomei. Even the egg in Jiang Xiaomei\u2019s hand was not left behind.Five eggs were all packed in his arms. Jiang Zhen raised his foot and kicked the table over again. \u201cYou\u2019d better not mess with me in the future!\u201dHe had not planned to do anything to the Jiang family. He even thought that if these people were good enough, he would take a few rest and recuperation meals in the Jiang family and leave the Jiang family when he was well. But what was the result?He just had a meal at the table, and these people were making a lot of noise.They don\u2019t let him eat well, so he doesn\u2019t have to let them eat well too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Of course, if the family is poor, they can only eat two meals a day.Everyone gets up at dawn in the morning, do some work first, and then eat the first meal of the day at around seven o\u2019clock. This is basically just porridge for most households. Of course, a wealthy family can eat it in a different way.After eating, they will continue with work, and towards noon\u2014that is, around twelve noon\u2014they will have the second meal. Families with enough basic food will have a dry meal. When food is insufficient, they will continue to eat porridge.And in the evening, they will eat another meal. Most farmers\u2019 meal in the morning is porridge.Although they eat three meals a day, the most important one is the noon meal, which Jiang family had just eaten.Because they were too busy until the late hours yesterday, the first meal of the Jiang family today was much later than usual. And because the morning meal was the dry meal cooked for the guests yesterday, they were not very hungry, so the second meal was delayed by an hour. Jiang Zhen looked at the sky and estimated that it was a little bit after two o\u2019clock at the moment.Waking up after one day and night of rest and after eating well, he finally feels well-rested. Jiang Zhen now has a little strength, so now he does not feel tired, carrying a big knife of about ten kilograms. But after lying down for a long time, his body was very sore.The wind in early spring was a little cool, but this body was not afraid of being frozen. It was well adapted . . . While turning around the memories of Eldest Jiang in his mind, Jiang Zhen observed the situation around him and began to understand the world.This area is a plain. As far as Jiang Zhen can see, he saw only a small hill, which was not very high at all. At the same time, it has a large population and many rivers.Although Jiang Zhen did not know Daqi\u2019s history, he felt that the environment here was almost the same as that of ancient China.This Hexi Village does not only have a river but also several ponds. The fields are full of vegetables, such as lettuce, and at a distance of two or three hundred meters, the houses, which are the residences of Hexi villagers, are scattered far from each other.Right then, the sun was high. On the stone steps by the river, several women were washing vegetables or washing clothes while talking.They saw Jiang Zhen walking by the river, but no one wanted to say hello to silent Eldest Jiang. When they saw Jiang Zhen holding a big knife, they only asked those around them, \u201cEldest Jiang is holding a knife. Who wants to have their pig killed?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t heard about that.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll follow and see if someone is killing a pig. I\u2019ll buy it a kilo of meat.\u201d\u2026Several women said a few words to others, so some people followed Jiang Zhen. However, instead of killing pigs, Jiang Zhen turned to the thatched hut that belonged to the Jiang family. It was where he had lain before.The hut was a little far from the other village houses, so when the Jiang family had money, they moved away, leaving only straw and bundles of mulberry strips.Apart from the fact that the house was too broken-down, Jiang Zhen liked it very much. It is quiet and Zhao\u2019s family house can be viewed not far away.Carrying a bundle of straw from the house to the door, Jiang Zhen sat down and put the knife next to him.Sitting alone was boring. After thinking about it, Jiang Zhen found another bundle of mulberry strips and began to peel them.In order to make mulberry trees grow bigger and easier to pick, the families that breed mulberry trees cut all the branches of mulberry trees every year. When the skins of these branches are peeled off, some people will buy them for several copper plates. The thin wooden poles with thick branches, like straw, are used to build a fire for cooking.The old Eldest Jiang did not know what the mulberry bark was for. But Jiang Zhen could guess that most of the mulberry bark was used for making paper.In ancient times, if you could make paper by yourself, you would have a means of making a living. However . . . Jiang Zhen\u2019s understanding of papermaking was limited to the point the teacher had told him about the four greatest inventions during a lesson in history and the occasional explanations he gathered from reading a book later. But he did not know the details, not to mention, he was currently poor and broke.How to support myself in the future? Kill pigs?In the past, Eldest Jiang worked with old man Jiang and learned how to butcher pigs. The pig butcher was also responsible for turning over pig intestines and other dirty work. Old man Jiang had not done it for a long time and let Eldest Jiang do it by himself. These jobs have little technical content. Jiang Zhen turned over those memories, trying to learn, but he also knew that it would be very difficult to live a good life on that alone.Forget it. The first thing to do is to be a long-term worker. Isn\u2019t Zhao Jinge living by being a long-term worker?Jiang Zhen slowly peeled off a pile of mulberry strips and was about to walk back when he saw Zhao Jinge walking along the road in front of his door.\u201cZhao Jinge!\u201d Jiang Zhen shouted and stood up.Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen in surprise and walked towards Jiang Zhen, but he stopped a few steps away and said, \u201cIs something wrong?\u201dAfter asking, he said, \u201cEldest Jiang, how are you?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m all right. Thank you yesterday.\u201d Jiang Zhen, took out two eggs and passed them to Zhao Jinge. \u201cFor you.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t take your eggs. A bowl of sweet potato porridge is not worth it.\u201d Zhao Jinge refused immediately. His family did not have a surplus food to raise and feed chickens. Eggs and similar things were very expensive to him.\u201cThese eggs are not used to return sweet potato porridge but to repay you for your life-saving grace. Is my life not worth two eggs?\u201d Jiang Zhen wanted to shove the eggs towards Zhao Jinge.Zhao Jinge subconsciously avoided it and paused then said, \u201cYou keep it yourself. It will help mend your body.\u201d\u201cI still have more. Look.\u201d Jiang Zhen took out three more eggs and showed them to Zhao Jinge.Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen in astonishment. He also knew that Eldest Jiang had been neglected by his parents. Where did this man get five eggs now?\u201cYou saved me once yesterday, and you rescued me from the river once before. You can\u2019t help this, but you must let me repay you.\u201d Jiang Zhen grabbed Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand and tucked two eggs in his hand.Jiang\u2019s figure is very tall. Eldest Jiang height is also quite high in this village. Zhao Jinge is about the same height as him, his hands are also very big, so the two eggs can be easily held.Jiang Zhen grabbed his rough hand and suddenly felt a little confused, but before he could understand his mood, Zhao Jinge had already thrown off his hand.Jiang Zhen looked up and saw Zhao Jinge say, \u201cThank you,\u201d and left without looking back.Originally, he wanted to say a few more words to Zhao Jinge, but Jiang was a little stunned, but he soon realized, Zhao Jinge seems shy?While whistling, Jiang Zhen hid the remaining three eggs in the thatched cottage and planned to give them to Zhao Jinge the next day.He had already eaten two chicken legs today, and no matter how much he ate, he probably couldn\u2019t absorb it. It was better to chat with Zhao Jinge using the eggs.And . . . this body of Jiang Zhenwei, though it still has some deficiency, it still is somehow nurtured. How about Zhao Jinge\u2019s body? The Zhao family did not have enough food. Zhao Jinge used to work around the city as a short-time worker. His health was no better than that of Eldest Jiang.Having met his life-saving benefactor, Jiang Zhen picked up his knife and went back to the Jiang house, intending to go back and wait for dinner.At that time, Zhao Jinge had already returned to his home while holding the two eggs. His attitude was rather strange.He once saw that a beautiful woman in the village was sent eggs by an admirer, but ever since he grew up, no one had ever sent them to him.But Eldest Jiang\u2019s egg delivery must be different from those of those people. He is no different from a man now, and everyone else treats him like one.\u201cJinge, you are back?\u201d Zhao Liu saw her son and welcomed him with a smile on her face.\u201cUm,\u201d Zhao Jinge answered and gave her an egg, \u201cyesterday I gave Eldest Jiang a bowl of porridge, and he gave me two eggs.\u201d\u201cHow is a bowl of porridge worth two eggs? Give them back soon.\u201d Zhao Liu felt that this eggs should not be accepted.\u201cHe also said thank you for saving him,\u201d Zhao Jinge added.Speaking about that, Zhao Liu felt that taking eggs was nothing. \u201cYes, he should thank you. If it hadn\u2019t been for our Jinge, Eldest Jiang would have drowned.\u201d As Zhao Liu said this, she thought of the way the Jiang family did not say a word of thanks that day, and she was somewhat dissatisfied. \u201cAlthough Eldest Jiang was silent all day, he is still a reasonable one, and his mother was too much. Jinge, you saved her oldest son that day. I can\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t even know how to thank you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. When he saw Eldest Jiang drowning, he remembered his brother who drowned, so he wanted to go into the water to save him. He had not thought about repayment.\u201cWhat is nothing? You saved his life. If you are in play, he should have left his life in your hands,\u201d Zhao Liu spoke out.\u201cMother.\u201d Zhao Jinge interrupted his mother. Who is willing to marry him?Zhao Liu saw it and sighed again. Since he had dug out the cinnabar mole between his eyebrows, the people in the village actually viewed Jinge as a man. He saved a big man from the water, and no one thought that that was wrong.It would be nice if Eldest Jiang would join the family. Although the man is not talkative, he is honest and willing to work. He could live a long life. Unfortunately, a few years ago, when some people in the village helped them to visit Jiang\u2019s family, old Madam Jiang refused.She knew that old lady Jiang wanted to keep the eldest Jiang at home for work, but she could not say anything about it to an outsider.Zhao Liu felt lost but still served a bowl of porridge. She peeled an egg and brought it to Zhao Jinge.\u201cMother, you eat this porridge. You\u2019re not in good health. You should eat a few eggs to make up for it,\u201d Zhao Jinge said, cutting the remaining egg with a knife. \u201cMy father and I will be fine.\u201dZhao Liu could not refute her son. In the end, she ate the egg. Zhao Jinge also cherished his half of the egg.While eating the egg, he inevitably thought about Eldest Jiang, and then he felt something was wrong.Today\u2019s Eldest Jiang spoke generously and clearly and kept his head up straight, as if he has become a different person from before.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7 - The Second Uncle Of The Jiang FamilyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 7 \u2013 The Second Uncle Of The Jiang FamilyJiang Zhen, carrying a knife, slowly returned to the Jiang house and saw a large number of people gathered at the gate of Jiang\u2019s house.The villagers of Hexi Village basically built a few houses to the south as accommodations. These main houses often have smaller houses behind it, either thatched houses or storerooms. There were many children, so they often built a more structures behind the houses to serve as living spaces for their children.The Jiang family has four main houses facing the south\u2014two for the Jiang old couple; the third one for the second son, in the east; and another one for the third son, in the west. The second house in the west is the hall house, the place where the Jiang family ate.There was no house behind the hall, only a courtyard. There was also a well next to courtyard. Next to the courtyard, there was a storeroom, a kitchen, and Jiang Xiaomei\u2019s house. In northernmost side is a thatched house and a pigsty.Ordinary people have no money to build a large courtyard to wrap around the front and back of the house, but every household will have drying area, and the gate of the hall will never be closed during the day. Right then, Jiang Zhen saw a dozen or so uncles of his family smoking and chatting at the drying area of the Jiang family, and some people were gathered together to watch the fun at the drying area of their neighbors.These people, I\u2019m afraid, are waiting for me . . . Jiang Zhen knew this, but he was not afraid and walked forward. When he approached, he found that old lady Jiang was crying to those uncles, and in the hall, the dishes that he had knocked over that afternoon had already been cleaned up. A Jiang relative, who knew a little about carpentry, was working there with some Jiang butchers to repair the table.He split the wooden table with a knife and kicked it hard. The wooden Eight Immortal table was obviously worn out and broken.\u201cStinky boy, you dare come back!\u201d With the support of a group of Jiang family uncles, old lady Jiang forgot what she had been scared about before. She stood up, hating Jiang Zhen so much that her teeth itched.This \u201cdebt collector\u201d did not know what was going on. Yesterday, he came back like a changed person. Today\u2019s uproar made his family lose so much face. How could he have not drown the other day?Considering what had happened before, Madam Jiang\u2019s eyes were filled with bitterness.After Jiang Zhen grabbed the eggs and kicked the table over, the rest of the Jiang family became confused.They were all frightened. Zhu Shufen, who had just entered the house, immediately began to cry and then shouted that she wanted to live in the county town. Jiang Chengxiang had been working in the county town all this time. Although it was a half-an-hour walk to Hexi Village, he was impatient about walking back and forth every day and so rented a house in the county town.In the beginning, there was reason Zhu Shufen was willing to marry Jiang Chengxiang. Jiang Chengxiang promised her that they will live separately from the Zhu family in the county town. Although the Zhu family did not have much money because Zhu Xiucai wanted to study, Zhu Shufen grew up pampered and was unwilling to wait on her rural mother-in-law.She was very unhappy with the environment of the Jiang family. Now when she saw Jiang Zhen swinging a knife in front of her, she wanted to live in the city at once.The new daughter-in-law was going to leave a day after she got married. Old lady Jiang felt very embarrassed, but Zhu Shufen was determined to leave. She couldn\u2019t stop her. She watched Jiang Chengxiang and Zhu Shufen pack up their things and went away. Zhu Shufen didn\u2019t plan on living in the countryside since the beginning. The bed frame and bedclothes that she brought along with her were simply carried to the city, but she didn\u2019t need to collect them at all. They didn\u2019t have much to pack at all.Old Mrs. Jiang cleaned up the dishes on the ground, sent away her son and daughter-in-law, discussed it with old man Jiang, called for several of Jiang uncles, and made up her mind to teach Eldest Jiang a good lesson.There were many families living in Hexi Village, and there are more than 10 families surnamed Jiang. They were related to old man Jiang, but when old lady Jiang went out to cry for help, a lot of people came.Although these people learned from Madam Jiang how abominable Eldest Jiang had been, they didn\u2019t really take it seriously. What can Eldest Jiang really do? They were all clear about it. He was weak and easy to bully. He was beaten and never complained. Some of them were the same age as Eldest Jiang, and when they were young, they had bullied him, such as robbing Eldest Jiang hard of cut grass or pushing him down the ditch.Eldest Jiang would pull a knife at his parents? Is that a joke?Most of the table was chopped by Jiang butchers, who split it with their own knives.These people were standing around Jiang\u2019s drying area, chatting, and were very relaxed until they saw Jiang Zhen coming from a distance with a knife on his person.The men were still the same people, but they did not know why the current Eldest Jiang was making their hair stand up.\u201cLittle villain, you\u2019re back!\u201d A voice rang out, and with it, a thin old man with a long pipe came out, frowning at Jiang Zhen.\u201cHmm.\u201d Jiang Zhen knew the old man. He was his grandfather\u2019s brother and Jiang\u2019s uncle and a butcher brother. He should call the other party, Second Uncle. Living up to seventy years old was rare. The second uncle in Jiang\u2019s family was over seventy years old. He was the oldest person in the village, so he took himself very seriously.The second uncle looked at Jiang Zhen with a cold hum and slowly smoked his pipe. Then he continued, \u201cBad boy, did you throw over your dishes at home? Did you cut the table? I heard you robbed some things?\u201d\u201cSecond Uncle, who is it if not him? There were only a few bowls in our house, and he threw them over. And the table, it was a good one. He just split it like that!\u201d Old lady Jiang pointed to a pile of broken porcelain at the door.In the countryside, every family only had a few bowls. If one of them fell to the ground, it was enough to be distressed for a half a day. But right then, a pile had fallen off, not to mention that old lady Jiang was distressed. Even her second uncle and the others looking at her felt distressed for her.\u201cHe\u2019s still pointing a knife at us. He\u2019s trying to kill two old masters!\u201d Madam Jiang said again.\u201cVillage villain, is what your mother said true?\u201d The second uncle looked at Jiang Zhen coldly. Among the younger generation of children in the village, the one he disliked the most was the eldest Jiang. When other young people saw him, they all respectfully called him, \u201cSecond Uncle.\u201d This man never called him that. When he bumped into him, he just bowed his head as if he hadn\u2019t seen him. Just seeing him made him angry.Jiang Zhen felt that it was still necessary for him to explain. After all, he was a reasonable man.\u201cI fell in the water a few days ago and was thrown into a broken-down cottage in the west in the end. I could not get up because of the fever but didn\u2019t even have any water to drink for a few days. If it weren\u2019t for the good person who had given me a bowl of porridge, I would be dead.\u201d Jiang Zhen spoke in a faint voice about Jiang Zhenwei\u2019s experience. He felt that his chest was full of the strong feelings of resentment. \u201cI felt nothing. I was used to it. But when I come home yesterday, they didn\u2019t even give me a meal. I turned over the table from carelessness.\u201dJiang Zhen\u2019s plain remark drew the sympathy of the majority of the people present. The village head of Hexi Village, Jiang Ping, who is a generation apart from old man Jiang said, \u201cButcher Jiang, Eldest Jiang is also your son. You can\u2019t be so inattentive to him. This child almost drowned, and you left him alone. It\u2019s too much.\u201dHexi Village is close to the county town; the law in the village is insignificant. The village head had little power. Usually, when the villagers quarrel, they come to him to resolve it. Old lady Jiang did not take Jiang Ping seriously.\u201cIt\u2019s just falling in the water. When I married my third child in those days, I was busy all day long. When did I have time to take care of him? Isn\u2019t he already good?\u201d old lady Jiang said.Butcher Jiang had a nickname, \u201cOld Knife,\u201d and his temper was not good. He did not like this son. He was very disgusted with his son\u2019s actions these past two days. Now, he said, \u201cThis bastard doesn\u2019t take us seriously as his father and mother. How come it our fault in the end? He\u2019s such a big man. Do we have to cater to him when he wants to eat or drink?\u201dAt this point, Jiang Ping became silent. Although he sympathized with Eldest Jiang, it was other people\u2019s house matter, so he could not be too speak out about it.The tobacco leaves in the second uncle\u2019s pipe had gone out. He tapped a few times on the peach tree by the house, poured out the ash from the pipe, and said to Jiang Zhen, \u201cEvil boy, kneel down!\u201dJiang Zhen frowned and looked at him without saying anything.\u201cKneel down and kowtow to your parents to apologize, and then take 20 hits from the sticks. When that\u2019s over, remember to be filial to your parents in the future!\u201d Second uncle Jiang said it, but there was no ancestral temple in Hexi Village, and no lynching had ever happened been done before. However, second uncle Jiang had heard of such things in other villages, so he used this rule now.Kneel down and be hit by a stick twenty times . . . What if you break him? Jiang Ping frowned immediately. As for the rest of the people, some gloated over the other person\u2019s misfortunes while others showed sympathy.\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d Old madam Jiang felt that it was not enough.\u201cSo you want me to kneel and kowtow?\u201d Jiang Zhen suddenly asked.\u201cYes, kneel down!\u201d the second uncle said again. His pipe struck the to peach tree full of peach blossoms.Jiang Zhen sneered and went straight for the second uncle. He grabbed his clothes and directly picked up the skinny old man. \u201cIf you want to kneel, go kneel on your own!\u201dAfter saying that, Jiang Zhen directly pushed him down and grabbed the pipe in his hand.\u201cYou . . . You . . . What do you want?\u201d The second uncle lay on the ground, looking up at the tall Jiang Zhen foolishly.\u201cYou said to respect the old and love the young. I won\u2019t hit you.\u201d Jiang Zhen stepped over the second uncle with a pipe in one hand and a knife in the other, then he went to the other people present, smiling, and for some reason, the man standing opposite him could not help but feel the coldness in his heart.\u201cI already died twice, once when I fell in the water and later when I died of hunger. I\u2019ve died twice, and I can\u2019t afford to be a loser anymore.\u201d Jiang Zhen smoked the pipe hard while looking at someone about the same age as Eldest Jiang and who had bullied him before. He kicked that man and then kicked him again on the crotch. \u201cIf you came to cause me trouble again, I will kill you. One life is not worth much, and I have nothing to lose!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8 - Beating people up and killing chickensPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 8 \u2013 Beating people up and killing chickensHexi Village is located in the land of fish and rice. It has always been rich and has no natural or manmade disasters. It is also very close to the county town. People who live here are not violent. When villagers fight with each other, it is usually the \u201cif you push me, I will push you\u201d sort.Jiang Zhen came up and beat his prestigious second uncle up. These people could not help but feel foolish. After Jiang Zhen kicked a sturdy man on his crotch and that man wailed, they all became white-faced.Jiang Zhen\u2019s body had not fully recovered as of yet. But when he was on a mission before, he was still able to fight with drug lords after being shot. Now he had to deal with a group of farmers. What is so difficult about it?Even if he couldn\u2019t fight hard, he could exploit other people\u2019s weaknesses . . . like the crotch, couldn\u2019t he?As he spoke, Jiang Zhen walked toward those people. The knife in his hand was shining with cold light. People almost unconsciously took a step backward.Their way of life had always been soft; they were fearful of pain and afraid of death. Right then, Jiang Zhen was deadly.These people were called for by old lady Jiang in order to reprimand the eldest Jiang, but they didn\u2019t want to fight with him. When they saw the knife in Jiang Zhen \u2018shand, they all wanted to run away.\u201cEldest Jiang, are you crazy?\u201d Jiang Ping was the head of the village, so he still had some courage to speak out.\u201cI\u2019m not crazy. But if you don\u2019t give me a way to live, I\u2019ll fight like hell with you!\u201dJiang Zhen smiled at these people, but in the next second, he saw a man who had bullied Eldest Jiang before and kicked him in the crotch. The man saw other people suffer, but he was too excited to run away. As a result, Jiang Zhen put down his leg and threw ashes at the back of the former bully\u2019s neck with the pipe.The second uncle\u2019s pipe was made out of bamboo as thick as a thumb. And its bottom section was specially shaped to a certain hardness. Jiang Zheng smoked then directly stunned the other man with the pipe, which made him fall to the ground.\u201cYou . . . You will get in a lot of trouble . . .\u201d Even Jiang Ping was frightened.Jiang Zhen did not speak and continued to walk towards them. Naturally, he did not kill the person who fell down. Before, when peeling mulberry strips, he got a good idea as to the level of strength of his body. Right now, a blow to the back of the man\u2019s neck could make a person faint but never die.All the men retreated.\u201cBastard!\u201d Butcher Jiang, holding a door bolt, suddenly rushed towards Jiang Zhen and tried to hit him with it.Jiang Zhen had been paying close attention to the situation around him. Of course, it is impossible for him not to know the action of Butcher Jiang. He threw his pipe and knife to the ground. He first evaded the bolt, moving to the side, then grabbed it and then pushed and pulled it, snatching the bolt directly out of Butcher Jiang\u2019s hands.He jabbed Butcher Jiang with the door bolt, making him fall down.With the door bolt in hand, Jiang Zhen looked coldly at the people around him with a sneer and said, \u201cDo you want to fight again?\u201dOf course not! People around him shook their heads.\u201cEldest Jiang, you can\u2019t commit a crime . . .\u201d Jiang Ping\u2019s voice shook.\u201cIf no one provokes me, of course, I will not do anything. If anyone provokes me, I will come into their house at night. Clean knives will go in, and red knives will come out!\u201d Jiang Zheng looked around, and his eyes finally fell on old Madam Jiang. \u201cYour neck, I guess it\u2019s a little easier to cut off than a pig\u2019s neck.\u201dWhen old lady Jiang shouted for people and called for some men, some of the women took their children to Jiang family\u2019s house to watch the hustle and bustle. At that moment, several children were frightened and burst into tears.The people standing in front of Jiang Zhen also wanted to cry right then.This Eldest Jiang is absolutely crazy. If they offend him, they might really be killed by him.If you had a good life, who was willing to offend a madman for the sake of others? A timid man hiding behind Jiang Ping took the lead in running. Then another uncle in Jiang\u2019s family also ran away. Then the village head, Jiang Ping, hurriedly left. He also had a wife and child. He must take good care of his family.The man who covered his crotch and cried in pain was a neighbor of the Jiang family. He was brought back by his father. Even the second uncle did not dare pick up the pipe that Jiang Zhen had thrown on the ground and just slipped away.Jiang Zhen picked up the knife on the ground and held it along with the door bolt. And ignoring the men who had fainted on the ground, he strode inside the house.He crossed the hall and went back to the storeroom to sleep. He did not want to see that the few rags and clothes of Eldest Jiang had been cut and thrown into the courtyard.Jiang Zheng frowned and went out again. Then he slammed the door bolt in front of old Madam Jiang. \u201cWhere\u2019s the key to the third house? Take it out!\u201dOld Madam Jiang had been frightened again. She was subconsciously going to pick up the key but stop right then. \u201cWhat do you want to do? You can\u2019t enter the third house!\u201dJiang Zhen was a little impatient. He simply slashed the knife into the wall above her head and said, \u201cGive it or not?\u201dOld Madam Jiang sat down on the ground; her legs went soft. She trembled and cried out, \u201cLittle sister, little sister, bring the key from my bedside . . .\u201dCountry people usually leave their houses unlocked. During the day, the doors are open, and at night, when they return to the rooms, they bolt the door. But the Jiang third son had always been fastidious, and his house also had a copper lock.Jiang Xiaomei brought the key, and Jiang Zhen swaggered and opened the door to Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house and entered the clean new house.The knife for cutting pig bones was a bit heavy after all . . . When he entered the room, Jiang Zhen threw the knife to the ground, bolted the door, rubbed his wrist, and began to look at the room.Zhu Shufen\u2019s dowry was placed in the city, but Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house was still complete with a chest of drawers, a bed, two boxes, and some small things.Madam Jiang came in earlier to tidy up the bedclothes, and the bedding on the bed had been put away. Jiang Zhen pulled out a set of clothes from the box and laid it on the bed. He took off his clothes, found a set of Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s clothes, and put them on. Then he went to bed to rest.Quilted clothes were all used by others, but Jiang Zhen never picked them, but he didn\u2019t care at all. Of course, if he had money in the future, he would surely have to find new clothes to wear.People in Hexi Village raised silkworms. Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s quilt was light and made of soft silk. It\u2019s very warm. Jiang Zhen fell asleep not long after lying down. At last, he woke up because his stomach was too hungry, and by that time, it was already dark.Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house had gate it front, but there was a small door behind it. From that small door, you can get to the courtyard.Without taking the big knife, Jiang Zhen went out from the small door to the courtyard with the sharp knife for killing pigs. He planned to go to the kitchen to find something to eat. As a result . . . there was not a single grain of rice in the kitchen.Obviously, old lady Jiang hid everything he could eat.This scene was not unfamiliar to Eldest Jiang, who sometimes worked outside until late. And when he came home, he was faced with an empty kitchen. In the end, he could only go to the field to find some lettuce and radish and then go back to the storeroom to sleep or just go to bed hungry.When Jiang Zhen recalled that, his heart burst in sadness.Not only did the eldest Jiang leave his memory to him, but his soul did not seem to have left yet. When it happened to someone else, the man must have felt nervous. Jiang Zhen did not take it seriously. He just patted his heart and then walked towards the Jiang\u2019s chicken coop.Jiang family raised chickens. Old Madam Jiang originally raised six chickens. But for Jiang third son\u2019s marriage, she killed four. At this time, there were only two hens that had just begun to lay eggs.When the villagers raised chickens, they are basically raised in fenced places. The village was full of people Every household who killed chickens and eat meat could not hide it from others, so there was no worry about someone stealing it.In the evening, everyone would put the chickens back into their own henhouse, not letting it be caught by a weasel or a wild cat at night. Right then, two chickens of the Jiang family were in the henhouse.After dark, the chickens were particularly quiet and easy to catch. Jiang Zhen opened the chicken nest, reached out, and caught a chicken, and then directly wrung its neck.In the kitchen, he started a fire and boiled water. Jiang Zhen plucked chicken. He heard old lady Jiang moving behind him.It was very dark, but there was a fire in the kitchen, and it was also bright. With that light, old lady Jiang saw Jiang Zhen feather-shedding a chicken inside.With a cry of distress, old Madam Jiang looked at Jiang Zhen in disbelief. \u201cWhere did you get the chicken?\u201d\u201cCaught it in the chicken coop.\u201d Jiang Zhen looked up and smiled at Madam Jiang.\u201cYou killed a chicken! You . . . You . . .\u201d Old Madam Jiang put her hand over her chest and pointed at Jiang Zhen. In Jiang family, don\u2019t mention chicken, even if they want to eat eggs, they have to get her permission. Jiang Zhen had right then killed the chicken she intended to lay eggs!He\u2019s crazy!Old Madam Jiang was just about to swear. But suddenly, she remembered what Jiang Zhen had done during the day and she stopped talking.Her eldest son is really crazy! It was foolish of her to forget the two chickens and just thought about hiding the grain.\u201cYou\u2019d better leave me some food in the kitchen in the future or else . . . Next time I\u2019m hungry and have no chicken to eat, I\u2019ll kill the pigs in the backyard,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.Old lady Jiang froze. She could put food and chickens in her house and lock them up, but she could not drive two pigs into her own house, could she?The flash of fire in the oven made Jiang Zhen look very gloomy. Madam Jiang suddenly remembered her legs and ran away.After a while, she came back, threw down a bag of rice, and said with trepidation, \u201cYou can\u2019t eat all of the chicken . . .\u201d\u201cWell, I\u2019m tired of eating chicken alone.\u201d Jiang Zhen took the bag of rice, scooped a bowl into the still boiling water, then sat down and continued to pluck the chicken.The sadness lingering in his chest had disappeared. Jiang Zhen looked at the chicken and thought of Zhao Jinge, whom he favored.Tomorrow, he\u2019ll send the man a chicken leg.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9 - Continuing to flirt with the benefactorPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 9 \u2013 Continuing to flirt with the benefactorJiang Zhen\u2019s ability to survive in the wild was strong enough to handle a chicken. After a while, he cleaned up the chicken feathers and removed all the internal organs from the chicken\u2019s belly.Rural people don\u2019t want to waste chicken intestines, even chicken blood. But Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t have the heart to deal with chicken intestines. He simply threw them aside. If old lady Jiang wanted them, let her handle them by herself.However, Jiang Zhen would not deal with chicken intestines, but for the first time, he washed the chicken liver and threw it into the pot with the porridge.In modern times, because of high cholesterol, a lot of people don\u2019t eat chicken liver, but now . . .Jiang Zhen was sure that consuming animal internal organs would be good for his body.Animal internal organs are high in calories and fat, rich in vitamins and trace elements, many of which he currently lacked.After throwing the chicken liver into the pot and boiling it, Jiang Zhen dug out two pieces of chicken breasts, cut them into shreds and boiled them with the porridge. Then he put the remaining pieces of chicken in a shallow earthen pot and steamed them on the steamer.Jiang Zhen cooked the porridge for a long time then boiled and drank it. Finally, he found another earthen pot and put it in Jiang third son\u2019s house for tomorrow. As for the chicken . . . he took both legs and wings and left a chicken skeleton in the kitchen.When old lady Jiang would see the chicken skeleton the next day, she would probably be angry again. But overall, all these years, when had she not reluctantly given only a bite of chicken bones to Eldest Jiang? He was now rewarding his grievances with virtue.Jiang Zhen went to sleep again.Jiang Zhen slept all the time until he woke up. He woke up and chewed a chicken wing and the cold chicken porridge.He cooked a lot of porridge last night. After eating some for himself, he still had a lot of porridge left. Two chicken legs and the remaining chicken wings were put into the earthen jar filled with porridge. Jiang Zhen took the earthen jar in one hand and the knife in the other and left Jiang house again.This time, instead of going to Jiang\u2019s broken hut, Jiang Zheng kept going south.There was a big river on the south side of Hexi Village. There were many boats coming and going on this river. It is said that water transport was from this river. There was a pier in He Cheng County, where the people came and went and was very lively.But there was no wharf here, but there were a lot of trees by the river.This forest did not belong to anyone, and the vast fields north of the forest belong to the richest man in Hexi Village, Zhao Dahu.Zhao Dahu and Zhao Jinge are both surnamed Zhao. They were also family members, but their connection was very distant. At least, Zhao Jinge did not receive any preferential treatment.Zhao Jinge used to follow Zhao Fugui to do short-term work for Zhao Dahu\u2019s family. But now, he had become a long-term worker of Zhao family.Short-term workers earned more per day and had more work to do. They were often stared at by their owners from dawn to dusk. Long-term workers got lower wages but had a more stable and relaxed work environment.Of course, that was only relatively. From the memory of Eldest Jiang, Jiang Zhen learned that the long-term workers here had to not only work in the field but also do the housework for the main family. Eldest Jiang once saw Zhao Jinge washing clothes for Zhao Dahu.Moreover, the family of Zhao Dahu was somewhat stingy; the masters of long-term workers should give something to eat, but they couldn\u2019t bear to give Zhao Jinge a little grain so that Zhao Jinge has to go home for dinner every day.This master\u2019s home was really not good, but for Zhao Jinge, it was the best choice. At least, while he worked for Zhao family, he could take care of his family\u2019s house.Jiang Zhen came to the woods at the edge of the canal, picked up some dead branches, and dug a hole in the ground. Then he put the pot on the fire and boiled it.After cooking for a while, Jiang Zhen saw Zhao Jinge coming this way.The family of Zhao Dahu eats three meals a day, and when they eat at noon, they send Zhao Jinge out every time or let him work in the field, let him chop wood or carry water.That day, Zhao Jinge held a small axe. It looked like he came to chop up firewood.\u201cEldest Jiang?\u201d Zhao Jinge was surprised to see Jiang Zhen, and his eyes were attracted by the delicious porridge in front of Jiang Zhen.\u201cCome on. Have porridge,\u201d Jiang Zhen called.\u201cNo, I have to work.\u201d Zhao Jinge slightly frowned. \u201cEldest Jiang, I heard that you beat up the Jiang family elders yesterday.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Jiang Zheng admitted it directly, but his heart was tight. If Zhao Jinge was old-fashioned, he would have to think he had done something wrong. He was afraid that he and Zhao Jinge might not have a future.\u201cYou . . . Be careful,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. Offending the elders of the clan was not a good thing for the eldest Jiang.\u201cI\u2019ll be careful.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled at Zhao Jinge and relaxed. He was worthy of his attention and concern for him.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Zhao Jinge nodded and went elsewhere.\u201cWait a minute.\u201d Jiang Zhen suddenly stood up and pulled at Zhao Jinge. \u201cI can\u2019t finish my porridge. You stay and eat with me.\u201dZhao Jinge was caught by Jiang Zhen and subconsciously struggled but could not break free.\u201cWon\u2019t you give me a chance to pay a debt of gratitude?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked again.\u201cYou\u2019ve already given the eggs.\u201d Zhao Jinge looked awkwardly at Jiang Zhen, who was pulling at his hand.\u201cIs my life worth two eggs?\u201d Jiang Zhen insisted and said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t sit down and eat, I\u2019ll follow you all the time, follow you back to the village, and follow you to your home.\u201d\u201cYou . . .\u201d Zhao Jinge was shocked by the words of such a scoundrel like Jiang Zhen. He was impatient and anxious. He sat down after thinking.\u201cI made this porridge. It tastes good. Eat more.\u201d Jiang Zhen saw that Zhao Jinge stayed behind, smiled and gave Zhao Jinge a ceramic spoon from Jiang house.\u201cWhere did you get the chicken?\u201d Zhao Jinge looked at a pot of chicken porridge in front of him and subconsciously swallowed his drool. When he was a child, his family still had a good life. They would kill a chicken for the holidays, but later, his family became poorer and poorer, so he couldn\u2019t eat chicken. He only bought a chicken for the Lunar New Year and counted the number of pieces to give to his guests.\u201cCaught it inside the chicken coop.\u201d Jiang Zhen laughed and saw Zhao Jinge looking at him with a puzzled expression. He added, \u201cAfter all these years, you know what those people in my family have done to me. This time, I almost died. Isn\u2019t it right for me to eat chicken to improve my body\u2019s health?\u201dZhao Jinge thought about it. No one else knew about it, but he knew. Eldest Jiang was almost starved to death before. Moreover, the Jiang family was rich, and that day, Jiang Chengxiang was full of good food. This time, it\u2019s really proper to give Jiang Zhenwei a chicken.\u201cEat it.\u201d Jiang Zhen took a spoon in one hand and chopsticks in one hand. He scooped a spoonful of porridge with a spoon and half-chopped chicken liver with chopsticks and stuffed it into Zhao Jinge\u2019s mouth.Zhao Jinge was suddenly fed. His whole body froze. He didn\u2019t dare to chew the chicken liver and his hands trembled.If it hadn\u2019t been for the sun and rain that made his skin dark every day, he would have showed a big red face that instant.Jiang Zhen saw his shock and quickly changed the topic. \u201cCan you see anything at night?\u201d In rural areas, many people suffered from night blindness due to lack of vitamin A, and Eldest Jiang was lucky enough to have it.\u201cYes . . . It\u2019s a little blurred.\u201d Zhao Jinge slowed down because there was something in his mouth, and his voice became a little muffled. He liked chicken liver, or as long as it\u2019s all meat, but right at the moment, he can\u2019t taste the chicken liver in his mouth.\u201cEat more chicken liver and pig liver, and you\u2019ll be able to see clearly in the future . . . I\u2019ll try to get it for you in a few days\u201d said Jiang Zhen.Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen in surprise. What else did the eldest Jiang plan to give him to eat?Jiang Zhen smiled and said, \u201cYou are my benefactor, and I should repay you.\u201d It was best to make a promise.Naturally, Jiang Zhen let Zhao Jinge feel that he was thinking about something more but also finally calmed down. \u201cYou really don\u2019t need to\u2014\u201d\u201cAnd I have something else to ask you about\u201d Jiang Zhen interrupted Zhao Jinge\u2019s words.\u201cWhat can I do for you?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked.\u201cI want to live separately. If there are no accidents, I\u2019m going to live in that shabby hut next to your house. I\u2019ll be alone then. You must help me a little\u201d said Jiang Zhen.He will certainly leave the Jiang family in the future. At first, he thought about whether to pack up his things and live with the Zhao family immediately after he left the Jiang family, but later, he felt that that would be a little shameless.He didn\u2019t even have the ability to support his family, so he was ashamed to go straight to his wife\u2019s house. What\u2019s more, when he was there, it would tear up his face with the Jiang family. If he ran to Zhao at that time, he would certainly make Zhao Jinge family staying in the village difficult.He can do whatever he wants. But he can\u2019t involve his wife\u2019s family. So first talk about love and take care of his health, and then he can think of something else.His body was too shabby at the moment. It would be a shame if he couldn\u2019t hold out for half an hour.In modern times, Jiang Zhen has never been able to get a wife to warm his bed. He could not help but glance at Zhao Jinge now and then countless times. The more he saw, the more satisfied he was, and liked him more.\u201cYou want to live separately?\u201d Zhao Jinge saw the haunted look of Jiang Zhen\u2019s and felt uncomfortable.\u201cWell, I want to leave the family and not be their workhorse,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. As soon as his voice fell, he felt a joy coming from his chest . . . Again, these emotions left by Eldest Jiang came out. As a matter of fact, this old Jiang still has a little emotion left in his body, which was one of the reasons why Jiang Zhen cannot immediately introduce himself to Zhao Jinge as a pillow. But he didn\u2019t care too much about it. He had a hunch that when he messed around for a while, Eldest Jiang would probably be able to leave with peace of mind.Although Zhao Jinge\u2019s family was poor, his parents had been very good to him, and he had never been accustomed to Jiang family\u2019s bad treatment of Eldest Jiang. He did not feel that Eldest Jiang wanting to live separately was doing something wrong. \u201dThat\u2019s good. Don\u2019t worry. I\u2019ll help you then.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10 - For a few MonthsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 10 \u2013 For a few MonthsIn the countryside, living alone is often difficult and leaves one vulnerable to bullying.Because of this, women or gers, who had decided to live in their mother-in-law\u2019s home, like to find those who had more brothers. If Eldest Jiang separated from his family and was not married after he went back from working in the field, he may not even be able to eat a hot meal, so he really needed some help.And if he had been assigned to the shabby hut of the Jiang family, wouldn\u2019t he be closest to the Zhao family?Zhao Jinge accepted Jiang Zhen\u2019s reason. When he ate porridge, he felt peace of mind. But Jiang Zhen kept staring at him. He moved slowly and urged him to eat more, which, in the end, made him a little uncomfortable.\u201cI will come to you if you get in any trouble in the future.\u201d Jiang Zhen also gave another chicken leg to Zhao Jinge. \u201cHere. Take it.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to give me chicken legs.\u201d Zhao Jinge quickly refused. Being able to eat some delicious porridge was already good enough. He had thought that he was going to work hungry.\u201cI\u2019ve eaten more than half of this chicken. What is chicken leg for me? Don\u2019t I already have one? Eat quickly.\u201d Jiang Zhen put the chicken leg on Zhao Jinge\u2019s lips, and then saw Zhao Jin\u2019s whole body froze up again.Zhao Jinge finally ate chicken leg, and then Jiang Zhen gave him a chicken wing, saying that there was no meat in the chicken wing, so he did not like to eat it himself.Zhao Jinge could not refuse Jiang Zhen directly. He could only put the chicken wings into his mouth.Jiang Zhen looked at Zhao Jinge sweetly eating; he even chewed up the small bones in the chicken wings. He ate the other chicken leg in a good mood.The two men ate a pot of chicken porridge clean. Although Zhao Jinge had tried not to eat the shredded chicken in the porridge, but he ate a chicken leg and chicken wing that was attached to the wing root, and he also had oily water in his stomach.Jiang Zhen was very satisfied that he could feed Zhao Jinge so much. He washed the pots clean and asked, \u201cWhat else do you want to do?\u201d\u201cI have to cut firewood,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cI will accompany you, Jiang Zhen.\u201d\u201cNo . . . ,\u201d Zhao Jinge subconsciously refused. What did Jiang Zhen want to do? Why did he refuse?Jiang Zhen was reluctant to chop firewood with his sharply sharpened bone-cutting knife, so he did not use the knife. Instead, he climbed a camphor tree and stomped on the branches with his feet.Half of the trees on this side are camphor trees. The branches of this kind of tree have always been very brittle. Jiang Zhen could easily trample off this section of branches; it wasn\u2019t long before he got many branches down.Zhao Jin bowed his head and chopped down the branches of Jiang Zhen as he cut down the trees. The dead leaves of camphor trees replaced by new leaves fell one after another, and many of them fell on him.Jiang Zhen looked down at him and saw the lines of his body after he bent down because his clothes were tight. Suddenly, his mouth was dry and his movements stopped.Zhao Jinge could not hear any movement. He looked up and saw Jiang Zhen staring at him. He felt like there was a fever rising to his face. Why did he eat porridge in the same pot with Boss Jiang just now and let Boss Jiang feed him chicken liver?For a long time now, Zhao Jinge had thought of himself as a man, and he usually grabbed a meal to eat with the other long-term workers, but that didn\u2019t seem to be the same with Eldest JiangNeither of them spoke, but the atmosphere between them was somewhat subtle.When Zhao Jinge cut enough wood and was about to leave, Jiang Zhen stopped him. \u201cJinge.\u201dZhao Jinge looked at him in a puzzled way, and Jiang Zhen added, \u201cI don\u2019t by the name of Jiang Zhenwei. Later, I want to be called Jiang Zhen . . . Don\u2019t call me Eldest Jiang in the future. Just call me Jiang Zhen.\u201dZhao Jinge nodded. \u201cJiang Zhen.\u201dJiang Zhen smiled at him.Zhao Jin looked at that smile; his heart beat a little faster. He bowed his head and walked away quickly.Watching Zhao Jinge with a large bundle of firewood on his back, Jiang Zhen raised his eyebrows and whistled.According to what he observed today, Zhao Jinge is 100% fond of men, and now, he should have a little interest in him. Also, this man is ger who thought he would marry a man. He does not like men who can like women that way.This Zhao Jinge was really made for him. He would have a wife soon. No, it shouldn\u2019t be long before he can marry himself off.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t mind joining the Zhao family at all.There were always some people who thought that it\u2019s a bit shameful to marry into a family, but in his eyes, the men who thought that way had no ability on their own. If a man had the ability and his children didn\u2019t use his surname, others would only feel that he was in love with his wife. Who would look down on him? Those men who were not capable themselves worry about that all the time. They would look at their own face more than the sky. They would not be able to earn face outside and blame their families.Of course, he didn\u2019t seem to be able to do anything now.While touching his nose, Jiang Zheng went home while shaking the earthen pot in his arm.People in the village were very busy. Jiang Zhen met many men and women working in the fields along the way, and some children were mowing grass or . . .Jiang Zhen raised his eyebrows and looked at a group of children gathered near a ditch not far away.There were rice fields on the side of the Hexi Village, and every household has dug water drains. The ditches were full of water all year round, and naturally, small fish and shrimps lived in it.Jiang Zhen went through his memories and discovered that the small children here liked to catch fish in the ditch. When they went home, they let their mother steam them on the steamer and eat it as a dish.The vast majority of the people in Hexi Village seldom eat meat. For example, Zhao Dahu\u2019s family eat it three or four times a month, but small fish and shrimp were not scarce. But because everyone was generally very busy, this activity could not be done every day. They only do it once in a few days, and it went basically into the mouths of the children.If you want to mend your body, you need to think of these things in the future.When Jiang Zhen returned home this time, the house was quiet.It was clear that, after he had made trouble, the people in this family had become peaceful for the time being.Instead of going back to his room to sleep, Jiang Zhen moved a bamboo chair and waited for dinner in the hall so that neither Jiang Chengcai nor his wife, who were waiting for dinner at home like him, dared stay in the hall but hid in the hall with their precious son in their arms.Jiang Xiaomei was assigned with cooking and feeding pigs by Madam Jiang. She did not dare to hide in the house and had to work in the kitchen, trembling.Although Jiang Xiaomei was the best person in Jiang\u2019s family to Eldest Jiang, she was not too good to Eldest Jiang. She often pushed her work on Eldest Jiang. Because of that, she was now afraid of Eldest Jiang.While Jiang Xiaomei was cooking a pot of porridge, the sky had darkened, and old Jiang and old Madam Jiang came back with hoes on their shoulders.When they saw Jiang Zhen, their faces were not very pleasant. Madam Jiang was even more eager to swallow Jiang Zhen. She just saw that Jiang Zhen had a knife in his hand. She did not dare clash with him. Instead, she scolded the Jiang family\u2019s second son, who came out of the house after hearing the news of their return. \u201cYou are really capable. Watching your parents work hard outside and just staying lazy at home. I\u2019m really guilty of raising a group of debt collectors!\u201dOld Madam Jiang meant to scold Huang Min. Jiang Chengwen and his family had never worked very much. She never scolded them before. Today, she scolded them in order to scold Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen knew all about it but nodded approvingly at Madam Jiang. \u201cMother, you\u2019re right. Chengwen is a real debt collector. If I give birth to such a bastard, I would kill him with a stick.\u201dOld Madam Jiang\u2019s face looked wonderful.\u201cMother, didn\u2019t you say you couldn\u2019t eat without working? Second brother, don\u2019t eat this meal,\u201d Jiang Zhen said while taking a big bowl of porridge from the pot.The Jiang\u2019s porridge was very thin. It\u2019s covered with porridge soup. When he ladled porridge with a long-handled wooden spoon, he scooped down to the bottom. After scooping up porridge, he poured the porridge soup back into the pot.Jiang Zhen filled himself a bowl of porridge without any porridge soup and sat down at the table.On the table, there was a bowl of salted lettuce, a bowl of pickles, a bowl of boiled cauliflower.That was basically what Jiang family dishes looked like, and of course, like Jiang Yuan Wen, he would eat another egg.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t pick it either. He snorted on the porridge bowl and kept eating lettuce and cauliflower with chopsticks.He ate so fast that old lady Jiang felt sick when she saw him eating there all the time.This fellow was born to be overbearing, not only did he not work, but also chooses to eat at home.Old lady Jiang kept cursing Jiang Zhen in her heart, but Jiang Chengwen didn\u2019t dare eat at all. He and his wife slipped into the kitchen with their son. At last, they could fill a bowl of porridge. After eating, they slipped back to their room.When the Jiang family was throwing a wedding, Huang Min took some dishes and hid them in their house. Although the porridge was not very thick, it would be good in addition to other dishes.When Butcher Jiang looked at his second son\u2019s posture, he felt that there was too little iron to become steel at that moment. He couldn\u2019t help looking at Jiang Zhen again. \u201cEldest Jiang, have you done enough? Stop fussing tomorrow and go to fields with me!\u201dBefore, in order to do Jiang second son marriage, they had no go to the field for five or six days, leaving behind a lot of work.Those acres of mulberry fields should be fertilized, and those vegetable fields should also be planted . . . The weather was getting warmer, and all vegetables and flowers were blooming. In addition to planting seeds, the other older vegetables had to be pulled from the fields and replaced with other kinds of plants. Besides, the drains must be opened, and rice would also start raising seedlings.In the past it was all done by eldest Jiang. Jiang butchers didn\u2019t have to worry about these jobs. They were basically all done before he thought of them. They could do some of them if they wanted and less if they don\u2019t want to. But now, Eldest Jiang doesn\u2019t go to work.The farmwork could not be pushed back. Butcher Jiang and Madam Jiang can only go to the field by themselves today. Now, after a day\u2019s work, Butcher Jiang felt that his waist was going to be broken.\u201cNo.\u201d Jiang Zhen did not raise his head either. \u201cI am in poor health right now, and I will need to rest for a few months at least.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This guy was obviously fine. How could he rest for a few more months? He\u2019s dreaming!\u201cYes. The second brother strained his waist when he cut rice last year, and he hasn\u2019t gone to the fields anymore. I walked between the juncture of life and death, and I should rest for a few months. Why don\u2019t I rest it for two years?\u201d Jiang Zhen put down the porridge bowl and looked sincerely at Butcher Jiang.Butcher Jiang was so angry that his face turned black. Jiang Zhen did not stop. He looked at old lady Jiang again. \u201cMother, I want to eat something good for my health. In the future, you should go to the county town to buy some chicken and meat every day. You don\u2019t have to buy too much. Just give me half a kilo of meat a day.\u201dYou don\u2019t want to work but still want to eat white rice and half a kilo of meat a day? Old Madam Jiang was shocked. Even the son of the landlord\u2019s family could not eat like that.\u201cYou-You . . .\u201d Jiang butchers wanted to fight with Jiang Zhen again, but when he thought of the people who had been knocked unconscious by Jiang Zhen yesterday and looked at the table that had just been mended in front of him, he still didn\u2019t dare to go against Jiang Zhen.\u201cForget it. This request was not very suitable. There is no meat to sell here. It is too unkind for you to go to the county town to buy it every day. In the future, just boil two eggs a day for me,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.\u201cThere is only one laying chicken in the house. Where do we get two eggs a day?\u201d Madame Jiang immediately asked that and was distressed at the thought of the chicken that the eldest Jiang had killed and eaten.\u201cIt\u2019s up to you to figure it out. If you don\u2019t give me two eggs a day . . .\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at the overly biased couple in front of him and gave a cold hum.Jiang Zhen had hands that were stained with blood and had murdered people. He did not know whether he was really murderous, but he knew that, as long as his feeling cooled down, he would not say a word but also give people tremendous pressure.When he was in the army, people called him Chief Jiang because he was the ruthless and the toughest one in the army . . . He, who had no father or mother, could do things more carelessly than others.Sure enough, after looking at Jiang Zhen, Butcher Jiang, who had killed a lot of pigs and thought he was a cruel man suddenly gave up and subconsciously moved his eyes away.After Jiang Zhen explained the matter and had dinner, he picked up the knife and planned to go back to his room to go to bed. But after a few steps, he turned back and said, \u201cBy the way, the porridge I just ate will be prepared for me tomorrow morning.\u201d I also want to eat two bowls of rice like this at noon. If I don\u2019t have enough to eat, I can only kill chickens and pigs.\u201dAfter dropping such a sentence, Jiang Zhen returned to his room and slammed the door shut.Jiang Zhen went to bed early as usual. Because he went to bed too early, he woke up in the middle of the night.He wanted to go back to sleep, but he suddenly smelled a sweaty odor, which came from him . . .\u201c. . .\u201d Jiang Zhen remembered that he had not bathed after crossing over. He had eaten, slept, and eaten again all day because he was too hungry and tired, and he had not noticed this odor at all.Jiang Zhen felt embarrassed when he thought of his smell when he went to cultivate feelings with Zhao Jinge yesterday.It was common for him not to bathe for ten days or even a half months when he was on a mission, but he always wanted to keep the image of cleanliness and tidiness in front of the man he liked.As a result, Jiang Zhen could not continue sleeping. He rolled out of bed and found a clean set of clothes in third Jiang\u2019s son wardrobe. He took it into the courtyard.Jiang dug a well in the courtyard, next to it was built a small shed covering an area of no more than two square meters. The Jiang family bathed and wiped themselves in this shed.Jiang Zhen first lit firewood and boiled hot water for himself on the stove. He flipped through his memory, went back to Jiang third son\u2019s house and found some fat beads that could be used for bathing.There was no soap on the south side of the Yangtze River. The common people in the countryside basically wash with water while shampooing was picking leaves and then rubbing these on one\u2019s head to wash it. But Jiang third son was very fastidious, and if he had spare money on his hands, he would buy fat beads to use.When he left, he didn\u2019t take away the remaining fat beads, so it was a good deal for but Jiang Zhen.When he found the fat beads, Jiang Zhen went to the shed to take a bath.He did not know what to do with the fat beads. He felt it was difficult to use. He could not help but miss the modern soap.He used to keep his hair buzzed, so he didn\u2019t need shampoo at all. The bar of soap could wash him clean from beginning to end. But then what? He found Eldest Jiang\u2019s hair difficult to deal with.But he couldn\u2019t cut his hair yet . . . Although it was all nonsense to him, he still needed to behave within a certain range. If he was too independent, he may get in trouble.Of course, if he ever got stronger and got a chance, he will be willing to act independently.Jiang Zhen took a full bath for an hour, washed off several pots of water, and rubbed countless pieces of mud from his body.After washing, he even had a feeling that he had lost a few pounds of weight and felt very comfortable.Changing into clean clothes left by third Jiang, Jiang Zhen felt that he must have become a lot more handsome and could not help whistling again.Combing his wet hair to the back of his head, Jiang Zhen left the shed where he took a bath, and as soon as he went out, he met old Madam Jiang, who got up early in the morning.At that time, it was still dark, and lady Jiang could not see clearly, so when she first saw Jiang Zhen in Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s clothes, she thought that her third son was back, but soon she remembered that her obnoxious eldest son was living in the third son\u2019s house at the moment.Old Madam Jiang never looked closely at her eldest son. She hated the man since he was a child. She felt sick after one glance, and she always felt that her eldest son was very ugly, but at the moment . . .It suddenly dawned on her that her eldest son looked good.He no longer hunchback his all day. He looked tall and straight. His originally sad face was covered with a smile that makes him look bright.This man is really her eldest son?The old lady muttered a little in her heart, but the idea disappeared after only one turn in her mind.The beaten up and scolded people one day suddenly could not bear the anger from such a thing. There was still a precedent to find. In the past, in their village, there had been beaten and scolded wife. One day, she suddenly killed her own man with a knife.When she thought of that, the old lady Jiang who wanted to scold Jiang Zhen for wasting firewood shut her mouth and did not dare to say anything.Jiang Zhen was too lazy to talk to old lady Jiang and returned to Jiang third son\u2019s rooms.He wiped his hair with a cloth towel, and when his hair was not so wet, Jiang Zhen spread his hair and went outdoors.It was very rude for a scholar at that time to spread his hair, but in the countryside, no one would think about it.When Jiang Zhen left the door, he went to the thatched cottage of the Jiang family. When he got to that place, he found the three eggs he had hidden the day before yesterday.Boiled eggs could be kept for a few days, but it was not good to keep them for too long. Jiang Zhen was waiting near Zhao\u2019s house with eggs, and when Zhao Jin came out, he stopped Zhao Jinge.\u201cJiang . . . Jiang Zhen?\u201d As soon as Zhao Jinge went out, he saw Jiang Zhen and his face showed surprise.\u201cJinge.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled at Zhao Jinge.\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen and suddenly found that Jiang Zhen was a little different again today. A few days ago, although Jiang Zhen looked a lot different, he was still a dirty countryman, but today\u2019s Jiang Zhen was almost like the people living in the city and even made him feel a little ashamed of himself.\u201cTo see you.\u201dWhen Zhao Jinge heard Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, he could not help but be a little happy, but soon felt that it was not so good.\u201cDid you eat?\u201d asked Jiang Zhen.\u201cI ate porridge,\u201d Zhao Jinge said that because Zhao Dahu\u2019s family did not give rice, so his mother usually cooked an extra bowl of porridge the night before. He drank that bowl of porridge in the morning before going out.\u201cEat porridge, take a few pees, and it\u2019s gone. Here, have an egg,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, taking out an egg, and started peeling it off.\u201cNo!\u201d Zhao Jinge is about to leave immediately. He just ate the chicken given by Jiang Zhen yesterday. He couldn\u2019t eat Jiang Zhen\u2019s eggs again today.\u201cIf you go any further, I\u2019ll shout.\u201dBrother Zhao Jinge stopped and looked seriously at Jiang Zhen. \u201cJiang Zhen, it\u2019s not very good of you to do so.\u201d\u201cI just want you to have an egg. What\u2019s wrong with it?\u201d said Jiang Zhen while putting the egg directly into Zhao Jinge\u2019s mouth.Zhao Jin\u2019s mouth was stuffed with an egg. He couldn\u2019t say what he wanted to say, but he frowned tightly, or because he had dug out the cinnabar mole in the center of his eyebrow, he looked as if he were frowning.When he dug out the cinnabar, it should\u2019ve hurt, right? Jiang Zhen reached out and touched the center of Zhao Jinge\u2019s eyebrows.Zhao Jinge\u2019s face showed a look of panic. He glanced at Jiang Zhen, subconsciously stepping back a few steps, and then he turned and strode forward.After walking for a long time, Zhao Jinge calmed down.Jiang Zhen\u2019s behavior made him feel strange, but he did not hate it. Jiang Zhen. Is he going to make do with me in the future?Zhao Jinge had self-awareness, and didn\u2019t think that Jiang Zhen would like him, but if Jiang Zhen wanted to make do with him, it was still possible.Jiang Zhen did not please his parents. After separation, he was estimated to be given nothing. In the future, he could never marry a good wife, so he could only find a defective woman or simply find a widow, if they wanted to be with him.He could work although the work of his family was not good. He could make a do. For Jiang Zhen, it was already must be pretty good, and their Zhao family, although there was no land, they at least had a good house.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He was a little flattered, and at the same time, he felt a little flustered.There was really nothing good about him, so was it possible that he actually misunderstood what Jiang Zhen meant?What\u2019s more, why did he just turn around and walk away? Would Jiang Zhen be unhappy and misunderstood when he left him like that?In fact, he was quite satisfied with Jiang Zhen. He had been working hard for so many years, and he was also a little tired. Naturally, he hoped that someone would accompany him on his road in the future.Zhao Jinge thought a lot. Before he knew it, he had walked to the bamboo grove near Zhao Dahu\u2019s residence.Just then, he was suddenly held by a hand.Zhao Jinge was startled. When he was about to pull his own hand away, he saw Jiang Zhen\u2019s face and quickly lowered his raised fist.\u201cJinge, let me give you two more eggs.\u201d Jiang Zhen gave Zhao Jinge the remaining two eggs. He followed Zhao Jinge all the way. Zhao Jinge facial movements were naturally all before his eyes.Zhao Jinge . . . It\u2019s obviously interesting to him too.He had thought it would take a while to catch Zhao Jinge, but he didn\u2019t expect to make such fast progress.Jiang Zhen has never been a slow person. He always wanted to cut the Gordian knot at once, but he thought he had many things to deal with at the moment. The old Jiang Zhenwei was still in his own body. In the end, he put up with it. \u201cJinge, when I\u2019ve lived separately, I need to talk to you.\u201dJiang Zhen did not say what he had to say to him, but Zhao Jinge also had a guess and immediately took the eggs and put them away.\u201cI\u2019m going home for porridge.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled at Zhao Jinge, turned around, and returned to Jiang family house.Zhao Jinge stuffed two eggs into his arms and continued to walk to Zhao Dahu\u2019s family house, but his heart was always disturbed.Other women in the village would always be humbled, and someone would always help them do some work or give them something, but he had never been treated like that. And now that he had eaten Jiang Zhen\u2019s eggs and chicken, he felt a little embarrassed.Because of that uneasiness, when the world was doing its work, Zhao Jinge found out that the basket he had made with bamboo strips was on the ground. He grabbed the loaches he found while he cultivated the field and put it in his basket.Hexi Village had many paddy fields and many ditches, and loaches were also very numerous. Loach tasted delicious and not very fishy. Even if you only put a little salt and steamed it, it would turn in a good dish, so it was very popular.It took a lot of effort to catch the loaches, that is, when the loach plowed the ground, you could see the holes drilled out by the loach and needed to dig them up with painstaking effort. But it was still not likely that the loach could be caught. Moreover, when the weather got hot, after raising rice seedlings and transplanting rice seedlings, the rice fields were full of water. Only one or two of the loaches could be caught in the ditch.Zhao Jinge usually has a lot of work to do, so he didn\u2019t have much time to mess with these. But when he was particularly gluttonous or when he wanted to replenish his mother\u2019s body, he would go fishing in the river or find a way to catch loach.But today, as he plowed the ground, he found and carefully picked up the loaches. Once he found it, he put it in the basket behind him.Because of that, he plowed the ground very slowly that day, fearing that it would be dark when he finished all the work.But even so, he kept looking at the loaches.\u2013 \u2013 \u2013When Zhao Jinge worked in Zhao Dahu\u2019s family house, Jiang Zhen returned to the Jiang family.When he got back, old Madam Jiang had just finished cooking the porridge. He snatched two bowls of porridge full of rice. One bowl was put aside to cool off, and the other was quickly eaten.While eating, he did not forget to remind old lady Jiang, \u201cWhat about eggs? Don\u2019t forget my two eggs!\u201dOld lady Jiang was too angry to look at his face, but when she saw Jiang Zhen carrying a big knife that did not leave his hand, she could only hold back her anger and said, \u201cI will cook the eggs at noon.\u201d\u201cAll right.\u201d Jiang Zhen said, \u201cGive me two boiled eggs at that time. They should be completely boiled.\u201d If she changes it to another cooking method, who knows if Jiang old lady will not try to cut off some of eggs?Old lady Jiang was really going to cut off some eggs for her precious grandson to eat, but when Jiang Zhen said so, she dared not think about it again and was reluctant to boil a few more eggs when she had no eggs at home. In the end, she could only stare indignantly at Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t care what Madam Jiang thought, so he went back to his room to go to bed when he had enough to eat.He got up in the middle of the night to take a bath, and since he was tired, he should have a good night\u2019s sleep.Jiang Zhen slept until noon, ate two eggs and two bowls of rice, went back to his room and stretched his muscles for a while, slept, and then woke up in the evening.He already talked to Brother Zhao Jinge once in the morning, but he missed him a little again. Jiang Zhen immediately pondered about that and waited till dinner to see him again.Even if he could not see anyone, he was willing to walk around the Zhao family house.\u2013 \u2013 \u2013Zhao Jinge caught loaches in a basket that day.After winter, the loach, which usually was the size of a finger, was thinner, but catching half of basket of it was enough to feed someone. Zhao Jinge\u2019s mouth curled up, and then the day started to turn dark.Rubbing his shoulders, Zhao Jinge took the farm tools and went to the main house of Zhao Dahu\u2019s family.Originally after returning the farm tools, he could go back home, but Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t expected that while putting the farm tools down, Zhao Dahu mother\u2019s would say, \u201cYou caught loaches? Leave it here. Tomorrow we\u2019ll have it for dinner.\u201dZhao Jinge was stunned and then said, \u201cOld lady, these loaches are useful to me.\u201d He used to catch something occasionally, and if they wanted it, he would give it to them. After all, the food of his family depended mainly on his work from Zhao Dahu. But today, he intended to take the loaches to Jiang Zhen.Madam Zhao did not expect Zhao Jinge to refuse. She became angry. \u201cThis is my field loaches! This is my family! Zhao Jinge, put the loaches down and go!\u201dZhao Jinge frowned, and the scar he made with his own hands became deeper. The loach in this area had always been owned by whoever caught it. How could it be it be owned by the one from whose land he caught it in?He was a ger, and his family did not have any close relatives, so Zhao Jinge had always been kind to others and never offended others, but today . . .\u201cOld lady, these loaches are of use to me,\u201d Zhao Jinge reiterated.\u201cWell, you Zhao Jinge, you can\u2019t even give up a few loaches. You don\u2019t want to work anymore in my house, do you?\u201d Old lady Zhao became more and more angry. She never liked Zhao Jinge, who did not marry well but worked. Right at that moment, Zhao Jinge did not listen to her, and she became even more angry.Zhao Jinge hung his head but stood straight and was unwilling to compromise.Madam Zhao was about to attack, but Zhao Dahu finally came out. \u201cMother, if he wants this loach, let him take it back. There is no shortage of loaches in our house.\u201dZhao Dahu has been watching them but didn\u2019t want to interrupt. Basket of loaches, who would not want it? But Zhao Jinge was too stubborn that he would probably refuse to leave the loaches. In order to avoid quarrelling and driving Zhao Jinge away from long-term work by his mother, he could only step in.Although long-term workers were easy to find, but he liked Zhao Jinge, who worked hard and did not sneakily steal. The long-term workers who he could pay less money and food were not easy to find. Zhao Dahu does not want to change people.Although Madam Zhao did not want to, she still listened to her son\u2019s words. She stared at Zhao Jinge fiercely. \u201cTake your muddy loaches. Get out!\u201dZhao Jinge returned home with half of basket of loaches then took out two eggs from Jiang Zhen that he had not eaten.\u201cWhere did you get so many things, Jinge?\u201d Zhao Liu looked puzzled at the eggs and loaches.Zhao Jinge opened his mouth. He was embarrassed to say that the egg was given to him by Jiang Zhen. He also felt embarrassed to say that he had caught the loaches and wanted to give some to Jiang Zhen. In the end, he said somewhat uncomfortably, \u201cSomeone gave me three eggs for the loaches. I have eaten one egg. Mother, I will kill the loaches. You cook it, and I will bring a bowl to him.\u201dIt\u2019s not uncommon to barter for things in the village. It\u2019s a little strange that loach should be cooked. But with a half basket of loaches, they can make two bowls and take one bowl for that someone, which was not bad.When Zhao Liu believed Zhao Jinge\u2019s words. She nodded. \u201cGood.\u201dZhao Jinge breathed a sigh of relief, gave the eggs for his parents to eat, and drank the bowl of porridge left by his mother, then he went to kill the loaches.Loaches were slippery and not easy to kill, but he had a lot of experience. Soon after killing them, Zhao Liu had already made a fire. Seeing that he killed the loaches, she threw them into the pot to cook.\u201cLoach is best cooked in oil and soy sauce, but unfortunately, there is no such thing at home.\u201d Zhao Liu sighed and put a little salt into the pot of loaches.The loaches were quickly cooked, and there were two bowls of it. Zhao Jinge left one shallow bowl on the side and walked outside with the other full bowl. He wanted to give it to Jiang Zhen. But when he left the door, he was stunned.He wanted to give the loaches to Jiang Zhen, but now . . . How was he going to find Jiang Zhen? I can\u2019t take the loaches to Jiang\u2019s house, can I?Zhao Jinge wanted to send some food to Jiang Zhen before, but he didn\u2019t have time to think about how to send it. It wasn\u2019t until that moment that he felt it was wrong.Carrying a bowl of loaches, Zhao Jinge unwittingly came to Jiang\u2019s ramshackle hut.\u201cJinge, our hearts are connected to one another. As soon as I got here, I saw you coming out of the house.\u201d Jiang Zhen suddenly appeared in front of Zhao Jinge.After hearing Jiang Zhen\u2019s voice, Zhao Jinge saw a dark figure in front of him, and his face turned inexplicably hot.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But even so, he was still very happy.After such a long time, Jiang Zhen was finally in love. He felt like a little boy and reached out for Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand. As a result, he didn\u2019t catch Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand but met, instead, with a still hot bowl.\u201cYou have something to do?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked, \u201cDo you want to bring food to someone? I\u2019ll go with you.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s for you.\u201d Zhao Jinge handed the bowl in his hand to Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen had sent things to Zhao Jinge. On one hand, he was repaying him for his kindness. On the other hand, he took a fancy to Zhao Jinge, but he really did not expect that he would still be able to get Zhao Jinge to give him something in return. After all, from beginning to end, he only gave him five eggs and some chicken.\u201cFor me? What is this?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cIt\u2019s loaches. I caught it when I plowed the ground.\u201d Zhao Jinge was somewhat embarrassed. Such things as loaches could be caught everywhere. Loaches from the farm were worthless; the value was definitely not as good as eggs and chicken.Jiang Zhen felt very happy but also a little guilty. He didn\u2019t spend any effort to get the eggs and chicken. In his opinion, it was really nothing, Zhao Jinge, who gave him loaches, could only slowly catch it. I am afraid Zhao Jinge spent a lot of effort.When he thought of it that way, he had done too little for Zhao Jinge.\u201cYou don\u2019t like it,\u201d Zhao Jinge said when he saw Jiang Zhen had not spoken.\u201cNo, I\u2019m happy.\u201d Jiang Zhen wanted to hug this person in front of him but felt that it was a bit too early. In the end, he just grabbed Zhao Jinge\u2019s other hand. \u201cLet\u2019s eat together.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going back.\u201d Zhao Jinge was startled. In the dark, the touch was magnified indefinitely. Although he only held his hand, he felt his hand getting hotter and hotter, and his body could not help but begin to sweat.\u201cLet\u2019s eat together.\u201d Jiang Zhen dragged him to the thatched hut not far away.Jiang Zhen found many good things in Chengxiang\u2019s house, including several candles. He found a piece of candle and blocked the candlelight with the stone that was near it, so he could look at Zhao Jinge.The candlelight was very weak, but Jiang Zhen could still see Zhao Jinge\u2019s appearance and also see the bowl of loaches in his hands.Zhao Jinge looked very much to his taste, but in fact, he was very rustic and the loaches in his hand was not even a bit a seller, but Jiang Zhen still liked to watch him more and more.Even though he had experienced life and death several times, he suddenly crossed to a different world. It was very difficult to accept it at the time; the feeling of dying was even more painful. It was Zhao Jinge who saved him.It had been a few days since he crossed to this world. Jiang Zhen had no sympathy for other people, but Zhao Jinge was different.It can be said that, in this world, the only person he accepted was Zhao Jinge.Jiang Zhen took Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand with his left hand but soon released it. He took a mulberry twig from the side and broke it and turned it into two chopsticks. After that, he sat down again and held Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand again.When Zhao Jinge hand was suddenly released, his heart felt tight. Now he was held again, he felt that his hand seemed to be burning. He even started to worry about it. He worked all day, and his hands were full of calluses. His hands were not smaller than Jiang Zhen\u2019s. Would Jiang Zhen dislike it?Jiang Zhen did not think so at all. He pinched Zhao Jinge\u2019s hands a few times, taking advantage of it. He took a loach into his mouth with the chopsticks and then he used the chopsticks to push one into Zhao Jinge\u2019s mouth.The loaches, only cooked in salt, didn\u2019t taste so great, but Jiang Zhen was never a picky eater. In addition, this was what Zhao Jinge especially caught for him to eat, so he thought that it was extremely delicious. But after Zhao Jinge opened his mouth and ate his loach, he couldn\u2019t help blushing.If he knew, he would have told his mother not to add oil . . .\u201cIt\u2019s delicious,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. The loach also had bones in the middle. He ate up the meat on one side of the bones. He ate one part and gave the other one to Zhao Jinge.\u201cYou eat. I don\u2019t have to\u2014\u201d Zhao Jinge quickly refused. The loaches were given to Jiang Zhen by him. He could not eat half of it himself.\u201cWhat is the point of dividing between you and me? We\u2019ll eat together in the future,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. As soon as his voice fell, he felt that the hand he was holding tremble slightly.Aware that Zhao Jinge wanted to leave, Jiang Zhen directly suppressed him. \u201cEat before you go!\u201dZhao Jinge really wanted to go, but was worried about Jiang Zhen. He was worried about hurting the other and afraid that he would turn over that bowl of loaches. He was too afraid to struggle. \u201cYou let go of me!\u201d Hadn\u2019t Jiang Zhen always been very dull that he dared not speak to anyone? How did this happen?If they were both seen like this, the spittle and nails of the villagers would drown them!Zhao Jinge knew very well that it was wrong for him and Jiang Zhen to do so, but he did not know why, but he was not very angry.He never understood why those oily, thick-skinned men could always find their wife quickly, but now, he was vaguely aware.\u201cI will let you go, but you can\u2019t leave, or I\u2019ll chase you to your house,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. He actually wanted to kiss him. Unfortunately, Zhao Jinge was too shy. If he really tried to kiss this guy, he would definitely run away. He could only hold back for now.However, though he was restrained, he has already regarded Zhao Jinge as his own man. Of course, it was no problem for him to be with Zhao Jinge.In this ancient times, even the rich people lived less comfortably than modern people, but if he could find someone to accompany him for a lifetime, Jiang Zhen would feel that living in this ancient time was not bad.Anyway, he stayed in the army for a long time. He had no Internet addiction at all. He didn\u2019t feel that he couldn\u2019t live without high-tech products, like mobile phones.Zhao Jinge did not dare to go in the end. Then Jiang Zhen took a bite for himself and for him; they finished the bowl of loaches together.After eating, Jiang Zhen did not want to leave. Zhao Jinge was silent, and the two sat silently for a while until the candle was finally finished and went out.\u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d Zhao Jinge stood up, holding the empty bowl.\u201cI will go back too.\u201d Jiang Zhen said, \u201cTomorrow at noon, I will go to the place where we cut firewood together to find you.\u201dZhao Jin nodded and thought that Jiang Zhen might not be able to see it, so he said, \u201cGood.\u201dWhen the two men said yes, Zhao Jinge looked at the dark figure of Jiang Zhen before he went home. Jiang Zhen waited for him to leave. He picked up the pig knife from the side and went home in a particularly good mood.How nice to have a date with someone today, not to mention that I have also an appointment for tomorrow!But . . . Jiang Zhen looked at the knife in his hand and suddenly felt that there was something wrong with his image.He couldn\u2019t always hold such a big knife to meet Zhao Jinge every time, but he really needed weapons that could deter others.Thinking about that, Jiang Zhen went to the village\u2019s bamboo grove in the dark.He cut off two bamboos with a knife, and he went home with them.The next day, Jiang Zhen still got up early, and when he got up, he still didn\u2019t go to work. He sat in the yard and began to deal with the two bamboos that he brought back last night.He chose the thinner one, cut it off, made one about his own height, sharpened its head, and made it look like the same weapon.If there was such a sharp bamboo at hand and his opponent was holding a knife, there was no need to be afraid. After all, the knife was short while the bamboo pole was long. As long as he did not let people get close to him, he could definitely use his bamboo pole to remove other people\u2019s knives. The sharpened head above can also be used to puncture holes in others.Of course, the most important thing was that it would not attract strange eyes. And when he went out with bamboo pole, it would be much lighter than a knife.When one bamboo pole was ready, Jiang Zhen began to cut the other bamboo pole.He chopped the bamboo pole very thickly. First, he cut off two large bamboo tubes, then he made two plugs made out of woods. Then he began to make other things with the remaining bamboo.Jiang Zhen made two pairs of bamboo chopsticks and two cups from the smaller bamboo tube above. When he wanted to do something else, he found that he could not do anything else. He had to cut off a few more bamboo tubes and put them away for future use.Having finished all of these, Jiang Zhen took a porridge and rested, and by noon, he asked for two eggs and two bowls of rice.The dishes eaten in this place were all without any oil and water. Not to mention, from the two bowls of rice, Jiang Zhen only ate one bowl this time; the other bowl he packed into the bamboo tube. About the eggs, he also ate only one and put away the other.After doing that, he went to the kitchen to fill a bamboo tube with hot water. Then Jiang Zhen went out the door and left for his date.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jiang Zhen did not know why but he felt that he was not worthy of the other person.\u201cYou haven\u2019t eaten yet, have you? I brought you something to eat.\u201d Jiang Zhen laughed. In modern times, at the beginning of date, he would have treated him to a big meal, but now, he could only bring brown rice and eggs to Zhao Jinge. When he earned money in the future, he must let Zhao Jinge eat and drink well.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not used to eating at this time of day.\u201d Zhao Jinge gave a refusal quickly. Even if Jiang Zhen was relatively rich, still, he was not used to eating other people\u2019s food. Not to mention, most of the food Jiang Zhen had saved for him came from his own mouth.\u201cI\u2019ve brought it all. You can\u2019t not eat it.\u201d Jiang Zhen was very persistent, and after experiencing holding hands last night, as soon as he reached him, he took Brother Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand and then refused to let it go.It was a dark last night. Zhao Jinge had become used to being held, but not in broad daylight.People who became husband and wife also did not held hands in broad day . . . Zhao Jinge wanted to struggle, but he could not get rid of the hand holding him. He could only look left and right in fear of discovery.Jiang Zhen thought it was very interesting to see him like that but could not bear to let him worry too much. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. No one will come. Even if someone comes, I\u2019m sure I would know in advance.\u201d The vigilance he developed in the army had not disappeared. Even though he has lost a lot in all aspects because he had swapped bodies, but it was enough that he could keep an eye on the situation around him while he was having an affair.No, it\u2019s not an affair. He\u2019s dating someone openly and honestly.In the end, Zhao Jinge was still a little uneasy. He simply took Jiang Zhen to a large clump of bamboo by the canal and sat down.Ruo is a local kind of bamboo that had very thin stems and large leaves. People on this side of the Yangtze River wrapped zongzi with its leaves. Ruo grows in clumps and can reach to an adult\u2019s chest level in height. Because the leaves were very dense, the two could hide their figures very well. The children in the village liked to drill into the bamboo bushes and set up a hideout within, so they could never be seen from outside.This large clump of ruo bamboo beside the canal did not belong to anyone, so nobody took care of it. The leaves were not as big as those planted by the people of Hexi Village in front and behind their houses. They were not suitable for making zongzi, so no one would come to pick ruo leaves. The children were not allowed to play on this side of the canal, so it was very quiet here.Surrounded by ruo bamboo, Jiang Zhen took out the bamboo tubes he brought with him.One bamboo tube was filled with rice, another bamboo tube with hot water and an egg. These things were absolutely extravagant for Zhao Jinge. He didn\u2019t want to eat, but how could he refuse Jiang Zhen?\u201cIf you don\u2019t eat it by yourself, should I feed you like I did last night?\u201d Jiang Zhen, who was eager to try, looked forward to feeding Zhao Jinge.\u201cI will eat!\u201d Zhao Jinge hurriedly said. He didn\u2019t know how he had eaten the loach that Jiang Zhen fed him last night, but now, in broad daylight, he would absolutely allow that again.Remembering what happened last night, he actually wanted to run away, yet he was reluctant to do so.Zhao Jinge treasured food very much. Obviously, he could not even eat a mouthful of vegetables, but now, eating that mouthful of brown rice, he seemed to be eating some sort of delicacy. His face was full of satisfaction.With Zhao Jinge eating, Jiang Zhen was even happier than him. Jiang Zhen had been staring at Zhao Jinge, making him unable to hold his chopsticks properly.In the end, Zhao Jinge still refused to eat all the rice in the bamboo tube. Jiang Zhen did not persuade him anymore. Looking at him with a smile, he ate up the rest of the rice with the chopsticks Jinge had previously used, which made Zhao Jinge\u2019s face feel hot again.Then Jiang Zhen began to peel the egg.\u201cYou fell into the river before, and you\u2019re still not well yet. Don\u2019t give me that egg. Eat it yourself,\u201d said Zhao Jinge.\u201cI ate one at home,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. He somewhat regretted that he had eaten half of the food at home. He should have known better and brought it all here to eat with Zhao Jinge instead.\u201cYou can have another one too.\u201d Zhao Jinge was very persistent.\u201cWhy not half for each of us?\u201d Jiang Zhen divided the egg in half. Seeing that Zhao Jinge was still unwilling to eat it, he simply threatened him again, \u201cIf you won\u2019t eat it, I will kiss you right here.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d Zhao Jinge was so frightened that he trembled. Kissing! As a result, before he could recover from the shock, his mouth was stuffed with half of the egg.Zhao Jinge hastily took out the halved egg from his mouth.\u201cCome on. Let\u2019s exchange again and then eat? I want to eat what you\u2019ve stuffed in your mouth.\u201d Jiang Zhen handed over his half of the egg and wanted to exchange it with Zhao Jinge\u2019s half.Zhao Jinge\u2019s face turned black, and even though he tried to restrain himself, the embarrassment shown on his face could not be hidden in the end.Is Jiang Zhen flirting with me? How can he flirt with such a tall ger as me, who is bigger than those skinny men?Zhao Jinge was too embarrassed to return his half of the egg. In the end, he had to slowly eat it, but when he finished eating it, he still said, \u201cJiang Zhen, don\u2019t bring me food in the future.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Jiang Zhen refused directly. He knew that food was very precious in these days. Zhao Jinge did not want to accept the food he sent him, but he could not watch his future wife starve all day.What\u2019s more, in fact, he did not treat himself harshly. Even though he had split some of his food with Zhao Jinge, he himself still ate enough. After all . . . he also wanted to quickly improve his health and prove his pride on his wedding night.\u201cJinge, I really have no shortage of food. If you don\u2019t believe me, go to the village to inquire about it. Now Jiang family does not dare to starve me,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, you saved my life. What kind of food do you want to eat? You should tell me clearly. I must take care of you for you\u2019re my own.\u201dWhen did Jiang Zhen become one of his own? Zhao Jinge wanted to refute this, but after thinking about it, he didn\u2019t say anything in the end.If he said that, Jiang Zhen would misunderstand, and then he wouldn\u2019t like to live with him. What if he went to find someone else?\u201cI\u2019ll bring you food in the future, and if you don\u2019t eat it, I\u2019ll be angry,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. And he also added, \u201cAlso, if you don\u2019t eat my food and think about returning it . . . If you really want to do that, when I see you outside, even if you really want to repay me, I will return it to you again.\u201dJiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge said a lot of words to each other before Zhao Jinge went back to work. When Zhao Jinge left, he began wandering around the field.He thought of catching small fish and shrimp to supplement his health. Yesterday, after Zhao Jinge gave him loaches, this idea became even stronger.He\u2019s not going to do farmwork these days, so he might as well find a way to get some meat.Just as he was thinking about it, a frog jumped in front of Jiang Zhen.There were many frogs in Hexi Village. In Eldest Jiang\u2019s memory, frogs sang constantly at night in the summer. However, while the people here did not forbid children from catching fish and shrimp, they were not allowed to catch frogs. Even the adults themselves would not go and catch them.It was not because frogs were not delicious. In fact, people here call frogs pheasants, which meant frog meat was as delicious as chicken.There were two reasons why adults didn\u2019t catch frogs. One was that, when they killed frogs, frogs acted like they were holding their heads with their forelimbs. That made the ordinary people feel like killing frogs was very cruel, and the other reason was that frogs eat bugs.From Eldest Jiang\u2019s memories, people already knew that frogs could catch pests. Because there were no pesticides and they depended on frogs to catch worms on the fields, people became particularly friendly to frogs.Jiang Zhen saw the frog, and although he felt greedy, after thinking about it, he still decided not to catch it in the end.In the south of the Yangtze River, the climate was humid and hot. There were so many worms, and children were often made to catch bugs. Under such circumstances, he should not harm the frogs that could remove insects.But if frogs couldn\u2019t be caught and eaten, anything else was fine.Jiang Zhen\u2019s ability to survive in the wild was very strong. When they first trained, they had been thrown into the mountains with a mouthful of food. Later, when they went out on a mission, they encountered all kinds of difficult conditions.Jiang Zhen had eaten worms, earthworms, and everything that could be eaten. Of course, if conditions permitted, he would never eat them again.After walking around all afternoon, Jiang Zhen caught a snake as thick as a baby\u2019s arm.He actually saw other snakes, but they were too small to have any meat after winter, so he let them go and finally grabbed the biggest one and killed it with the sharp butcher\u2019s knife.With the sharp knife hanging on his waist, the bamboo pole in one hand, and the snake in the other, Jiang Zhen went to the river.\u201cEldest Jiang, did you catch a snake? What a big snake it is!\u201d Some people were washing rice and vegetables by the river. They saw Jiang Zhen coming. One of them was a thin white man.The man was thin and small but very good-looking with big eyes under his curved willow eyebrows, pink cherry lips under his small nose, and his skin was not as dark and rough as the others in the village. It was, instead, white and tender.He looked just like a woman, and he\u2019s wearing flowing clothes that looked similar to a skirt . . . Jiang Zhen felt strange when he saw him, but when he saw the red cinnabar between his eyebrows, he realized that this man was a ger.He knew that there were ger children in this place and that Zhao Jinge was a ger, but Zhao Jinge looked no different from a man, so he gradually forgot about it. Now, seeing such a girly man, he realized it again.\u201cEldest Jiang, I\u2019ve got acne on my face recently. I need to eat a snake to clear it. Give me your snake.\u201d The ger stared at the snake in Jiang Zhen\u2019s hand and smiled at him.Hexi Village people did not eat frogs but ate snakes, and they even believed that if you have skin problems and so on, just eat snake meat to cure it.Of course, the snake that the ger in front of Jiang Zhen wanted was not really for the sake of curing a pimple. He was only gluttonous for meat.The snake that Jiang Zhen caught was very long. When cleaned and deboned, it could give around three or four kilograms of snake meat. So anyone able to eat it would be absolutely satisfied.With this in mind, the voice of the ger softened a little further. \u201cEldest Jiang, give me your snake.\u201d. . .Zhao Jinge ate the meal delivered by Jiang Zhen that noon. He had something in his stomach and was in a good mood. He worked very quickly in the afternoon, and just then, he had finished his work and was ready to go home.On his way there, he planned to go to the river for a moment to wash his hands and feet before returning home. But he didn\u2019t want to see the best-looking ger in the village asking Jiang Zhen for something.Jiang Zhen was very generous; he was willing to give him eggs and chicken legs to eat. Now he was asked by this ger to give the snake, most villagers would give it to him.Although he had been working all day, because at noon he had eaten, Zhao Jinge did not feel tired at all and was full of spirit. But at the moment, after hearing the voice of that ger, he suddenly became depressed, only feeling that his whole person had become very tired.After retreating a few steps, he stood behind a few trees and waited in frustration for the next development.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15 - The other gerPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 15 \u2013 The other gerHe Qiusheng was the ger who spoke to Jiang Zhen.He Qiusheng\u2019s family was also very poor; in fact, it was in a similar situation as Zhao Jinge\u2019s family.Zhao Jinge family was poor because Zhao Liu was in poor health. Zhao Fugui sold their land to fund her treatment. Meanwhile, He Qiusheng family was poor because He Qiusheng\u2019s father was addicted to gambling.He Qiusheng\u2019s father loved gambling so much that he couldn\u2019t help gambling his money away. Although the bets were not too big, he still lost all of his family\u2019s profit and valuables every year. Finally, he even lost his fields, and the He family\u2019s situation fell sharply.Neither of the two families had any money, but compared to Zhao Jinge, He Qiusheng\u2019s life was like sky compared to earth. It was because there were many people in He Qiusheng\u2019s family.He Qiusheng\u2019s father could not support the wall with mud, but He Qiusheng\u2019s two brothers were practical and willing to work, not to mention that his father had several brothers.His uncles were very disgusted with He Qiusheng\u2019s persistent father. They were reluctant to take care of him but were still willing to help their nephews. He Qiusheng and his two brothers grew up well.But now that He Qiusheng\u2019s two brothers were all grown up, these days, life at home was slowly getting better.He Qiusheng was also growing very well, which made his life especially comfortable.Although He Qiusheng is just a ger, he still looked better than the most beautiful girl in the village. Naturally, He Qiusheng was loved by many since he was young, and the boys in the village were especially willing to take care of him.When he went out with others to cut grass, he did not have to do it. Others gave it to him, and all he had to do was call out a few sweet cries to his brother.When he went fishing with others, he did not have to go into the river. Someone will give him the biggest fish they had caught, and all he had to do was give them a smile.In Hexi Village, He Qiusheng has always been supported by the boys his age. But he was still young. He sent out a message that he will wait until he will be sixteen before he will consider any proposal. Hence, if not for that, many family relatives would have already broken into discussions with the matchmakers.Yes, He Qiusheng was not yet sixteen but only fifteen years old, ten years younger than Eldest Jiang, so these two people didn\u2019t have much contact before. Eldest Jiang had no deep impression of him. Such a beautiful ger. Eldest Jiang then did not dare to take a closer look.It was the first time Jiang Zhen saw the so-called good-looking ger. He couldn\u2019t help but take a few more glances. But after looking at him, he was a little disappointed. He had always liked strong and handsome men, and He Qiusheng . . . Not only did he look like a woman, but he behaved like a woman, which was really not to Jiang Zhen\u2019s taste.\u201cBig brother Jiang, can you give me the snake you caught?\u201d Seeing Jiang Zhen staring at him, He Qiusheng showed his smile towards Jiang Zhen, and his voice was sweet again.He did not like Eldest Jiang, but the snake he caught made him feel greedy, so he wanted to get the snake from Eldest Jiang, and he did not feel that Eldest Jiang was unwilling.An old bachelor like Eldest Jiang would usually give him what he wanted if he asked for it.\u201cYou want this snake?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cYes.\u201d He Qiusheng looked at Jiang Zhen and blinked big eyes full of longing.\u201cThis snake weighs about five kilograms. It\u2019s value is the same as a chicken. If you have a chicken and trade it with me, I\u2019ll give you the snake,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.He Qiusheng\u2019s face suddenly changed. He didn\u2019t expect that Eldest Jiang to refuse him. He also thought so beautifully\u2026 It\u2019s just a snake. The old bachelor wants to trade a chicken for it?Jiang Zhen came from modern times. There, a kilo of snake meat costs one hundred yuan while chicken is ten yuan a kilo. He did not think there was anything wrong with exchanging snake meat for chicken. But for He Qiusheng, saying such a thing was definitely illogical.Could snakes caught outside compare to chickens raised at home? Even if Jiang Zhen was carrying a chicken, he would not ask for it because he felt that no one would be willing to give it to him.The men in the village often sent him things\u2014loach, eel, everything you can fish\u2014even eggs would be given, but no one would send him a whole chicken. After all, for the villagers, chickens were important property of the family.\u201cYou want me to exchange it for a chicken?\u201d He Qiusheng asked again, but he also thought that he might have misheard.\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to exchange, get out of my way,\u201d Jiang Zhen said again and went to the river to wash the snake. He never looked at He Qiusheng again.For the first time, He Qiusheng was treated so indifferently by another. He was so angry that he gave Jiang Zhen a vicious look. \u201cHumph! Who cares for your snake!\u201d After that, he left without looking back.\u201cEldest Jiang, you\u2019re so hard-hearted. You don\u2019t care about such beautiful ger,\u201d the middle-aged woman who washed vegetables next to him said. Although He Qiusheng liked to take small advantages for love, he still had a sense of propriety, and he only took things from unmarried men, so the villagers do not hate him because he\u2019s also quite considerate.That ger was unlucky to have such a father in the house. There was no land in that poor family, so there was nothing wrong about asking others for food.Jiang Zhen did not say anything; he did not think that He Qiusheng was beautiful. What was more, he was still waiting to cook this snake and eat it with Zhao Jinge. What would he give it to that inexplicable person? Of course, if somebody wanted to trade chicken for it . . . He preferred eating chicken, which was relatively oily, to snakes, which had slightly tougher meat.Peeling off the snake skin and ripping off the intestines, Jiang Zhen washed the snake clean.Snake gall was considered a good thing in Hexi Village, but Jiang Zhen was not interested in it, so he gave it to the middle-aged woman next to him and asked the woman to take it back to her grandson.When Jiang Zhen returned home with a big snake, old Madam Jiang and Jiang Xiaomei were cooking dinner while Butcher Jiang was talking with Jiang Chengwen. He asked Jiang Chengwen to go with him to the fields tomorrow.It was obvious that, after he refused to work in the fields, the Jiang family had a little too much farmwork to do.Of course, that had nothing to do with Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t have a knife today, but with a snake in hand, Butcher Jiang still did not dare to call him out to do things. Jiang Zhen, without knowing what farmwork should be done, sat at the threshold and waited for dinner to be ready.Meanwhile, Zhao Jinge walked away from the river quietly while Jiang Zhen was washing the snake and returned home.Instead of going to the river to wash his hands and feet, he scooped up water from his own tank with gourd ladles. After washing, he stared at his reflection in the water.If he were a man, this appearance would be too rough for the townspeople, but it was not bad in the countryside. He face was quite satisfactory in the countryside, but he was a ger.Jiang Zhen even acted like hooligan towards a ger like him and said he wanted to kiss him . . .Jiang Zhen refused He Qiusheng.Although Jiang Zhen did not necessarily refuse He Qiusheng for his sake, Zhao Jinge was still very happy at that moment, but he did not dare to show it on his face.He tried to keep his face straight, and then he saw from his reflection that he was frowning. Not gentle at all! He suddenly felt a little discouraged.\u201cWhat are you doing, Jinge?\u201d Zhao Liu saw her son staring at the water tank with a bitter and hateful expression and shouted.\u201cNothing.\u201d Zhao Jinge said, \u201cMother, there is no water in the tank. I\u2019ll go and pick some more.\u201d\u201cGood.\u201d Zhao Liu nodded and agreed. There were many rivers on their side of the country. For washing clothes and vegetables, they have always gone to the riverside, but the water for cooking was prepared in a water tank. She was not in good health and could not walk all the time, so she used water in the tank to wash dishes and vegetables.When Zhao Jinge passed by several families in the village while carrying a bucket from the river, he heard someone talking about Jiang Zhen, so he stopped again.\u201cThe eldest Jiang really changed himself. I heard he not only doesn\u2019t work now but also eats and drinks two eggs a day!\u201d\u201cJiang family used to treat him too harshly, otherwise, how could they have forced him into this?\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s gone a little too far. How miserable his mother cried today. She frankly said that she raised this son for nothing.\u201d\u201cShe didn\u2019t raise Eldest Jiang so much either . . .\u201d\u201cBut she\u2019s still the mother of Eldest Jiang. Who would use a knife against his own mother? That\u2019s too much.\u201d. . .People talked about it one after another although they felt that Jiang Zhen\u2019s actions were excusable, but they also felt that his parents had done too much.When Zhao Jinge heard this, he breathed a sigh of relief. Jiang Zhen was really eating well and did not save food to give him, which made him feel less guilt.Zhao family still had porridge in the evening. Recently, the weather had been a little bit hot. The vegetables in the field were blooming. They should be eaten early. The dishes were boiled vegetables in a large bowl.After drinking two bowls of porridge and eating a large bowl of green vegetables, Zhao Jinge was full.After eating enough, Zhao Fugui took out the money he earned from working as a short-time worker these days and gave it to Zhao Liu.The Zhao family was reluctant to light the lamp. After Zhao Fugui said that he had earned money from the short-term work he had done these days, he went back to bed with Zhao Liu. Zhao Jinge should also go back to his room to sleep. But in the end, he unexpectedly opened the door and went out to the Jiang family thatched cottage.\u201cJinge, are you waiting for me?\u201d Jiang Zhen\u2019s voice suddenly rang out again. Zhao Jinge turned his head and saw Jiang Zhen with two bamboo tubes.\u201cJiang Zhen . . .\u201d\u201cJinge, I caught a snake today. Shall we eat together?\u201d Jiang Zhen shook the bamboo tube in his hand.After today\u2019s dinner, he went to Jiang\u2019s kitchen and chopped the snake into pieces and cooked it.Old lady Jiang hid all the soy sauce, rapeseed oil, and so on, and there was only a little salt left in the kitchen. He was too lazy to ask her for seasoning, and he planned to cook the snake casually. As a result, old lady Jiang kept on talking outside the kitchen, dismissing him for burning snake meat and using too much firewood.Then . . . Jiang Zhen used a knife to force old lady Jiang to take out the vegetable and soy sauce.He took out the snake meat that had been boiled in water for a while, put oil in the pot first, then stir-fried the snake meat slightly, and finally added soy sauce and a little water to boil it for a period of time . . . Jiang Zhen made a pot of fragrant snake meat though his cooking skills were mediocre.Then he took the snake meat back to his room and left nothing for the rest of the Jiang family.Jiang Yuan Wen, the darling of the Jiang family, cried because he didn\u2019t get to eat snake meat. Old lady Jiang had scolded him from outside the room. Jiang Zhen was annoyed to hear it. He simply locked the door to the room with two bamboo poles and went out to find Zhao Jinge.At first, he was still a little worried. He was worried that Zhao Jinge was asleep and he could not call him out of his house. He did not expect to see Zhao Jinge from afar.Once again, Jiang Zhen dragged Zhao Jinge into the thatched cottage.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16 - Fat and healthyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16 \u2013 Fat and healthyJiang Zhen brought two bamboo tubes of snake meat but did not give Zhao Jinge any of the bamboo tubes on the spot.If he gave Zhao Jinge a bamboo tube now, then they each would be holding a bamboo tube and eat snake meat in silence. So how would feelings develop?Together with Zhao Jinge, they sat down in the same place as yesterday. Jiang Zhen opened a bamboo tube, took out a pair of chopsticks, and fed Zhao Jinge a piece of snake meat.Today, Jiang Zhen did not light candles; the surroundings was much darker than before, but Zhao Jinge could clearly feel the person next to him.\u201cI cooked this snake meat. Try it.\u201d Jiang Zhen\u2019s voice sounded, at the same time, a piece of snake meat was put on Zhao Jinge\u2019s mouth.The smell of the snake meat was very tempting, but it was a tempting smell Zhao Jinge could still resist. He could only think about He Qiusheng, who had asked Jiang Zhen for the snake before though Jiang Zhen did not give it to him to eat. Suddenly, he could not wait to taste the snake meat.Zhao Jinge opened his mouth and ate the snake meat. Then he saw Jiang Zhen eat one on his own.The snake meat was a bit tough. Zhao Jinge chewed for a while and then took back his hand only to remove the bone from inside. After that, he felt embarrassed.Zhao Dahu\u2019s children were not allowed to eat with their hands.Jiang Zhen did not pay attention to this small action. When he saw Zhao Jinge had finished eating, he took another piece to feed Zhao Jinge. \u201cIs it delicious?\u201d\u201cDelicious.\u201d He had also eaten snake before but never had such delicious snake meat.When Jiang Zhen heard Zhao Jinge\u2019s words, he deliberately leaned close to Zhao Jinge\u2019s ear and said, \u201cI\u2019ll give you more tomorrow.\u201dZhao Jinge felt that hot air was blowing on his ears, which made his hands and feet tremble a little. When he calmed down, he finally had the strength to chew the snake meat in his mouth and asked the question that had puzzled him for a long time. \u201cHe Qiusheng asked you for a snake before. Why didn\u2019t you give it to him?\u201d\u201cHow do you know that He Qiusheng asked me for the snake?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked, but his heartbeat was a little funny. He had already formed the habit of checking the situation around him at any moment. At that time, Zhao Jinge was hiding behind a tree, but he naturally found him out. After all, in this world, the person he was most familiar with was Zhao Jinge.But he didn\u2019t want to expose it from the very beginning; after all, it would be a good performance. Of course, even if Zhao Jinge was not there, he would still perform well. Such a thin ger is really not his type.\u201cI . . . I heard about it.\u201d Zhao Jinge bowed his head and had no confidence when he spoke.This man couldn\u2019t even tell a lie. But Jiang Zhen also liked that. \u201cThat He Qiusheng is not as good as you. Does not who I am, so of course, I did not give him your snake. In the future, all my things are yours.\u201dJiang Zhen was showing loyalty, but Brother Zhao thought he was talking nonsense.This man unexpectedly said that He Qiusheng was not as good-looking as he was . . . Are his eyes okay? But the last sentence was true.He Qiusheng couldn\u2019t see Jiang Zhen in that way, so He Qiusheng wasn\u2019t the one for Jiang Zhen . . . Well, Jiang Zhen knew that, so it\u2019s normal not to give him the snake.In exchange for what he had already laboriously taken, even if Zhao Dahu\u2019s son, who had been acknowledged as an upcoming scholar, had asked him for it, he would refuse even if Zhao Dahu\u2019s son were the most capable man in Hexi village.When he thought of it that way, Zhao Jinge figured it out, and he didn\u2019t have to worry about it. After eating a few pieces of snake meat, he thought that he\u2019d better send something to Jiang Zhen. \u201cI will catch eel and send it to you in a few days.\u201d Before his brother\u2019s death, his family had not needed to worry about not having enough food to eat; his father would often take them to find the eel.It took some time to do that, so when they did it, they often got up early in the morning and stayed at the riverbank for half a day to catch two or three eels.They used to have leisure time and had good moods but those days were gone.\u201cYou have to work. Don\u2019t do that. I\u2019ll just catch it.\u201d (Jiang Zhen)\u201cWill you?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked. Eel fishing also needed a bit of skill.\u201cJust learn slowly. I\u2019ll dig ditches first.\u201d Jiang Zhen ate another piece of snake meat. Most of the fields there were paddy fields. Because they all grew rice, the edges of the fields were ditches.There were loaches in the fields, and the ditches along the fields were also not without them. When people here wanted to catch fish or loach from the ditches, they usually chose a section of a ditch, which was then blocked by mud on both sides, then they used gourd ladles to scoop water from the ditches. Then they could casually be able to catch fish, shrimp, loach, and eel. They could even see soft-shelled turtle once in a while.These wild and pollution-free things were very valuable in modern times; however, they were not very valuable in this time. Some fish were too small to take home and could only be caught to be eaten by ducks.Jiang Zhen had this idea for a long time, but he hadn\u2019t had time to do it before.\u201cYou\u2019re not in good health . . .\u201d\u201cI\u2019m in good health. Would you like to check?\u201d Jiang Zhen could not help but begin to flirt with Zhao Jinge again.Zhao Jinge did not understand. \u201cCheck what?\u201dJiang Zhen laughed. When he laughed, his breath reached Zhao Jinge\u2019s ear, making him blush again. At the same time, the more he thought about it, the more he felt that there was something wrong with Jiang Zhen\u2019s words.Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge ate all the snake meat in the two bamboo tubes together. When they left, Jiang Zhen left Zhao Jinge\u2019s bamboo basket.There was not much food in the Zhao family. It was spring now, and it was the time for a much more serious food shortage. He used to go to sleep hungry at night, but today, he had snake meat in his stomach and was particularly satisfied when he fell asleep.It\u2019s just that he was full, but his parents were hungry, which made Zhao Jinge feel guilty.Because of that guilt, after Zhao Jinge got up early the next day, he scooped up the watery part of the rice porridge and left all the rice grains in the pot behind.At the same time, Jiang Zhen was busy fishing out the rice grains in the pot, eager to get dry rice out of the pot of porridge.Speaking of it, this ancient porridge was totally different from modern porridge cooked in a high-pressure cooker, electric cooker, or even a stew pot.The pressure cooker can boil all the grains of rice, but the ordinary iron pot on the farm were not able to do this. Not only did it take a long time to cook, but it also took some time to steam.Who had so much time to spend cooking porridge? Not to mention the firewood it consumed was too expensive . . . As a result, the porridge cooked by people in Hexi Village was often a pot of rice soup with many boiled rice grains.In the past, Eldest Jiang always drank porridge soup with a few rice grains, but now, Jiang Zhen specializes in fishing the grains of rice out of the soup.After eating enough in the morning, Jiang Zhen went out to dig ditches to catch fishes. However, old lady Jiang was so angry that she wanted to kill her eldest son.Speaking of which, this ancient porridge is completely different from the porridge cooked in a pressure cooker electric cooker or even a braised pan in modern times.A pressure cooker or something, it can boil up all the grains of rice, but the ordinary iron pot in the farm wants to do this. It will not only take a long time to cook, but also a period of stuffing.Who has the time to spend so much time cooking porridge? And that would be too much firewood. As a result, the porridge cooked by people in Hexi Village is often a pot of rice soup with many boiled grains of rice.In the past, Boss Jiang always drank porridge soup with few grains of rice, but now Jiang Zhen specializes in fishing for grains of rice.After eating enough in the morning, Jiang Zhen went to dig ditches to catch fish, but old lady Jiang was so angry that she wanted to kill her eldest son.It\u2019s just that she\u2019s just a village woman, and she dared to swear and beat people, but she didn\u2019t have the guts to kill, not to mention a village woman with what kind of ability, could she kill Jiang Zhen?At present, it was still cold, and although the children in the village will try to catch fish with some nets and bamboo baskets, there were still a few people who do so, so the ditches in the village had not been damaged. Jiang Zhen harvest in the morning was also good. But there was no big fish in the ditch, there were, basically, just small finger-sized loaches. Jiang Zhen busied himself for half a day, and the biggest fish he caught were only a few two-finger-width crucian carps.Crucian carps are small but, when steamed, tasted really good, were very tender. Other small fish . . . such small fish tasted best when fried in oil it. But these days, every family was short in oil; they were already reluctant to add a few drops of oil to steaming fish, so who was willing to use oil to fry worthless small fish?Jiang Zhen threw the uneconomical fish back into the ditch, dug up the place where he had blocked it with mud, and put the bamboo basket containing small fish and shrimps in the bamboo bushes by the canal.When old lady Jiang cooked the meal, Jiang Zhen filled two bowls with rice from the pot, and put two eggs in his arms. But he did not eat them. He took the snake meat that he had not eaten yesterday and went to find Zhao Jinge to eat together.When Jiang Zhen came to the canal with several bamboo tubes, Zhao Jinge was already waiting for him.Zhao Jinge did not sit idly and waited for Jiang Zhen. When Jiang Zhen came, he was chopping firewood, and his strong body was exposed to Jiang Zhen through his movements.In fact, Zhao Jinge did not have a lot of muscles. He could not get enough protein and did not specialize in muscle-building training.But his body did not have any additional fat and clearly hid a strong force within.\u201cHere you are.\u201d Seeing Jiang Zhen, Zhao Jinge immediately stood up and fixed his eyes on Jiang Zhen.When Jiang Zhen met Zhao Jinge\u2019s gaze, Jiang Zhen became slightly agitated. He looked at the past in a more unbridled way and let Zhao Jinge move his eyes away.Jiang Zhen had a lot of experience with casually eating cold food in the wild. He used to eat dry food with his comrades-in-arms when he went out on a mission, but he had never felt so happy as he was today.Although the food did not taste good at all, he still thought it was delicious.Zhao Jinge originally did not want to eat Jiang Zhen\u2019s lunch although Jiang Zhen brought a lot of things, but he usually drank four big bowls of porridge. Jiang Zhen himself definitely could finish two bowls of rice.But Jiang Zhen always had a way to get him to eat.When Zhao Jinge did not want to eat the egg that he gave him, Jiang Zhen suddenly said, \u201cYou should eat more and fatten yourself up. Big-assed gers are good for breeding,\u201d he said while looking at Zhao Jinge\u2019s butt.Now Zhao Jinge\u2019s black face turned red.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17 - Taking good care of yourselfPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17 \u2013 Taking good care of yourselfZhao Jinge managed to eat the egg.He ate very little that morning, but he was very full at noon under the care of Jiang Zhen, so he was particularly full that afternoon.But although he was very energetic and worked very fast, his mind was not on his work but on something else.After digging out his cinnabar mole, he regarded himself as a man and made up his mind not to marry. Even though he had recently planned on spending the rest of his life with Jiang Zhen, he forgot of matter of having children. But now Jiang Zhen mentioned it.Zhao Jinge felt guilty.The fertility rate of ger was closely related to the color of their cinnabar. The brighter the color of cinnabar moles, the higher the fertility rate of the ger, but his cinnabar mole had always been dull until he dug it up.At the beginning, the old man of the village said that it would be difficult for him to have children like this, which was one of the reasons why he couldn\u2019t marry out. Jiang Zhen should also know about this. Did he want him to take good care of himself so he specifically mentioned it today?It\u2019s hard for me to have children because I\u2019m ugly. Now I\u2019m also so old. I really need to take good care of myself. Otherwise, I may not be able to have children in the future.After working for a long time, thirsty and tired, Zhao Jinge wanted to scoop up some water to drink but stopped his movements.Families in the village paid attention so as to not let their women and gers drink fresh and cold water for fear that it might damage their bodies. He\u2019d better not drink.After sitting for a while, Zhao Jinge began to work again.Jiang Zhen did not know that, because of his flirtatious words, Zhao Jinge thought hard about it.In fact, he had no idea that he would have children in the future.Before crossing worlds, he never thought of having his own children. After crossing worlds, although he knew that Zhao Jinge was a fertile ger, he did not think too much about it. \u201cWell fed and good for breeding\u201d was nothing but casual talk, just to see how a shy Zhao Jinge looked.After having dinner with Zhao Jinge, Jiang Zhen went to pick up the fish he had caught in the morning.The fish had been thrown into the basket by him, and many of them had already died, but the loaches and other things were still alive . . . When Jiang Zhen got to the river, he began to scrape the fish scales and cut the belly with a sharp knife used to kill pigs, and cleaned up the small fish.The fish were easy to tidy up, but the loaches were too slippery and very troublesome to deal with. Jiang Zhen did not pay attention to it and even let a loach escape into the river.Loaches were not killed in many places; they were boiled directly for a few days. But here in Hexi Village, loach heads were cut off with a knife and washed before eating. As for the method . . .The loaches were dropped on the mud beside him, one by one, and Jiang Zhen cut off all the loaches heads with his sharp butcher\u2019s knife.Although the dead loaches were still slippery, but at least they would not escape. Then he needed to cut open their bellies and squeeze out their intestines.After dealing with the loaches, Jiang Zhen handled the eel that he had caught, which was small but thick, and he also cleaned some miscellaneous things.The snake brought home yesterday was cooked for himself, but today . . . Since he had regarded Zhao Jinge as his wife-to-be, then Zhao Jinge\u2019s parents were also his parents, so of course, he would show filial piety.As far as he was concerned, he had always respected the old and loved the young. If old lady Jiang and Butcher Jiang had not gone so far, he would have never used a knife to threaten the two old people.Carrying a bamboo basket, Jiang Zhen went to Zhao Jinge, who was digging in the field.The man who was working looked very tempting to him. Jiang Zhen wanted to cuddle with him for a few moments, but he was able to bear with his impulse in the end. He just took out the bamboo tube he had filled with water and gave it to Zhao Jinge. \u201cCome, drink some water and rest.\u201d Zhao Jinge\u2019s lips were dry and he was probably thirsty.Zhao Jinge was really thirsty. After receiving the bamboo tube from Jiang Zhen, he drank it all up (or drank bottoms up). He thought that he should bring boiled water from home to drink tomorrow.After watching Zhao Jinge finish drinking the water, Jiang Zhen collected the bamboo tube and gave him the bamboo basket. \u201cThis is for you.|\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Zhao Jinge opened the lid of the bamboo basket and looked inside. Then he saw that the small basket was full of fish and shrimp inside.\u201cTake it home and cook it. Even if the taste may not be too good, you need to eat more.\u201d Jiang Zhen said, \u201cTake it. I can\u2019t finish all of this alone.\u201d\u201cOkay . . .\u201d When Zhao Jinge thought about the need to take care of his body, he nodded and asked, \u201cAre you coming over tonight?\u201d\u201cI will!\u201d Jiang Zhen immediately said and looked at Zhao Jinge in joy. He did not expect Zhao Jinge to take the initiative to make an appointment with him.\u201cThen I\u2019ll cook it later and save some for you,\u201d said Zhao Jinge.\u201cAll right. Let\u2019s eat together later.\u201d Jiang Zhen\u2019s mood improved, and he could not help but want to kiss Zhao Jinge. Unfortunately, someone might come by at any time, and he could only give up on his plan with regret.Zhao Jinge smiled and looked at something in the bamboo basket. Somehow puzzled, he said, \u201cWhy did you put the stone crab inside? It\u2019s not good enough to eat. You can only feed ducks with it.\u201d\u201cEating this is good for your health,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. Zhao Jinge said this because crabs that lived in the river and in ditches were just a little larger than a dollar coin.This crab crawls everywhere in the countryside and likes to hide under the stones near the water, so people in Hexi Village call them stone crabs. They are so small that they don\u2019t have any meat at all, so no one eats them. They catch it for the purpose of feeding them to ducks.However, Jiang Zheng thought that such crabs should be able to supplement the body\u2019s calcium needs, so he did not throw them away but kept them.Since Jiang Zhen said it was good to eat it, Zhao Jinge secretly decided to catch few himself for him to eat more.Thinking of the last time Zhao Dahu and his family asked for loaches, Zhao Jinge did not carry the bamboo basket on his back when he finished his work to return the farm tools.After returning the farm tools and helping Zhao Dahu with some work, he put his hidden bamboo basket on his back and went home.\u201cDad, Mother, I\u2019m back.\u201d After returning home, Zhao Jinge gave the bamboo basket to his mother.\u201cDid you catch fish, Jinge?\u201d Zhao Liu looked at the bamboo basket and asked in some surprise that her son had time to catch fish during work.\u201cI didn\u2019t catch it. It was Eldest Jiang who caught it for me,\u201d Zhao Jinge said, bowing his head somewhat sheepishly.When Zhao Jinge mentioned Eldest Jiang, he felt a sense of satisfaction in his heart, hoping that his parents would him ask a few more questions. But Zhao Liu did not think much about it at all. \u201cIs he thanking you for saving him last time? He knows how to be grateful.\u201dZhao Liu continued, \u201cBut recently, his mother scolded him every day in the village . . . If you see him, please persuade him with few words. They are still his father and mother.\u201dIn the past, when Eldest Jiang was bullied, the people in Hexi Village sympathized with him, but when he suddenly became strong and became the one who bullied, old lady Jiang became the object of sympathy instead.But Zhao Jinge felt that old lady Jiang deserved it. He could not help but feel aggrieved for Jiang Zhen in his heart, but he could not speak and did not refute his mother.\u201cThere is no oil in our house. Otherwise, the fish would be delicious . . .\u201d Zhao Liu sighed. If the fish were too small, cooking would smash its small body, so she steamed it and ate the loach and eel. Zhao Jinge insisted on eating the stone crab, so she cooked it in a pot with the salted vegetables.There was no seasoning and not even a drop of oil. Fish cooked this way had a fishy smell, but the people here eat fish all the time; they no longer care about the fishy smell.Zhao Jinge had good teeth. He could chew those steamed little fish without picking out the bones. He could chew and eat up the fish whole in one swallow. With the serving of pickles, he ate three bowls of porridge in one breath.He also ate a lot of stone crabs, all of which had no meat in their shells, but they were delicious when chewed with their shells.Father and Mother Zhao also ate some small fish but especially left some salted vegetable, eel, and loaches for Zhao Jinge to bring to Eldest Jiang.As Zhao Jinge had similar thoughts, he nodded in agreement. But instead of carrying a bowl to Jiang family house, he waited at the thatched cottage. As a result, he had not waited long when Jiang Zhen came.They split the eel and the loaches.\u201cIt\u2019s a pity that there is too little seasoning and no oil . . .\u201d Jiang Zhen ate a piece of eel and sighed. At the same time, he began to think about getting some oil for cooking.It\u2019s just . . . in ancient times, there was very little oyster oil and the output of vegetable oil was low because of its poor oil extraction technology, and he really could not afford to buy it now.Jiang Zhen could now say that he had nothing, and even his body was not completely well-nourished, so he let go of these thoughts for the time being.As for the future . . . Jiang Zhen\u2019s eyes fell on the canal. He always thought he had to find a way to earn some money to support himself, and the job that was more suitable for him in this world, he was afraid . . . was to be a businessman.He did not have the skills to earn his living in ancient times, and he could not do anything else than to do business. Fortunately, it was not as difficult as in later generations to do business in these times. The so-called traders only had to exchange goods between two places.In the days that followed, Jiang Zhen had lived a very similar day-to-day life.In the morning, he tried to find all kinds of food that he could eat, had lunch with Zhao Jinge at noon, and then wandered around in the afternoon to continue to find what he could eat.The small fish and shrimps, which many people in Hexi Village despised, had good nutrition. After eating them for a few days, Jiang Zhen\u2019s complexion was much better. Zhao Jinge\u2019s whole body also looked refreshed. But all the ditches of Hexi Village were cleaned out. That summer, the harvest of children in the village were estimated to be much poorer than in previous years.At that time, with the arrival of the Qingming Dynasty Festival, the members of the Jiang family became more and more intolerant of Jiang Zhen.This eldest Jiang didn\u2019t work every day but still had to eat and drink well. Why?One morning, after Jiang Zhen went out, Butcher Jiang and old lady Jiang called Jiang Chengwen into their house. Then they discussed with Jiang Chengwen how to deal with Jiang Zhen.Old lady Jiang now hated Jiang Zhen, who scolded her all day long, even more. She scolded for a while before saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough for this son of a bitch to eat eggs every day, he even robbed the pot of lard from home yesterday. Why don\u2019t he just die?As old Madam Jiang thought of the pot of lard, she felt very distressed. She used her chopsticks to scrape a little bit of lard to cook when she become greedy. In the end, her eldest son actually took the whole pot of lard away . . . She still didn\u2019t know even now whether the lard had been eaten by him yet.\u201cMother, what is the use of your scolding? Let\u2019s think about another way to deal with him!\u201d said Jiang Chengwen.\u201cWe must teach him some lessons, so he will work in peace again,\u201d said old Jiang. Old lady Jiang had always blindly hated her eldest son. These days, however, old Jiang was well aware of his eldest son\u2019s good side.Before, when his eldest son was willing to work in the fields, when had he needed to work so hard?The three of them talked for a long time but couldn\u2019t think of any good way. Finally, Jiang Chengwen said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let the third brother think of something? He\u2019s the smartest.\u201d Both Jiang Chengwen and Jiang Chengxiang went to school at the beginning. And the result was Jiang Chengwen didn\u2019t learn anything useful, but Jiang Chengxiang learned a lot of skills and later found a job in the county town. Gradually, Jiang\u2019s family began to listen to him in regards to many major events.\u201cYes, let Chengxiang help us make up our minds,\u201d Butcher Jiang said and suddenly remembered another thing. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been to the county town for a long time. Let\u2019s go there today and deliver some food to Chengxiang and then buy a pair of candles for the ancestral worship.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18 - Discussing countermeasuresPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 18 \u2013 Discussing countermeasuresJiang Chengxiang lived in the county town and had enough income to support himself, so instead of giving him money, old man Jiang often sent him grain, vegetables, eggs, and various other things, so that Jiang Chengxiang did not have to spend money on rice and vegetables at all. However, recently, there had been a lot of things going on in the Jiang family. Jiang Zhen behaved like a master at home every day and scared them so much, they forgot to send things to Jiang Chengxiang.Now that a decision had been made, Butcher Jiang began to pack the things he wanted to give to Jiang Chengxiang.He needed to give more grain now, after all, his third son had now gotten a wife, so he needed to take enough for two people to eat. He should also take more vegetables. It\u2019s not worth it to spend money to buy them from others except for these two things. In the past, every time Butcher Jiang went to the city, he would bring some fish, shrimps, and eggs, but this time, it was all gone.There were only two chickens left in the house. Jiang Zhen killed one and said he had to eat two eggs every day. From where would they have any extra eggs left for Jiang Chengxiang?There were also fish and shrimps. In the past, it was Eldest Jiang who had done all the work in the field. Butcher Jiang was free to look for fish and shrimps. Now that Jiang Zhen is unwilling to do any work, old Butcher Jiang had become exhausted. How could he still have time to catch fish?Finally, only vegetables and grain were packed, and Butcher Jiang set out.After carrying the load for half an hour, Butcher Jiang arrived in Hecheng County.The canal ran through Hecheng County. There was also a big dock, making the whole country town very lively. Butcher Jiang came here from time to time, but he was still a little embarrassed when he looked at the people busily coming and going.The houses in the county town were all made of wood, built closely together by the river, but there were also walkable roads on the river bank. Butcher Jiang walked along the road paved with blue stone, and it was not long before he came to a small wooden hut.Hexi Village was not far from Hecheng County, so Butcher Jiang arrived at Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s in time for lunch.Jiang Chengxiang was responsible for keeping records of the passage to and from the dock. Because the coolies on the dock would take a break at noon to eat something, he could also go home for lunch. He was at home at the moment. Seeing Butcher Jiang, he immediately welcomed him in. \u201cDad, you\u2019re here.\u201d\u201cDad, come in and have some water to drink.\u201d Zhu Shufen took out her black tea, made a large cup of tea and greeted Butcher Jiang.Butcher Jiang often came here. He put down his load to sit down, then he said, \u201cChengxiang, Father brought you some food.\u201d\u201cDad, did you come again with cargo? Come by boat next time or you\u2019ll be too tired,\u201d Jiang Chengxiang said in concern.\u201cYes, Dad. Aren\u2019t you exhausted when you come all this way?\u201d As she spoke, Zhu Shufen went to see what Butcher Jiang had brought.After checking it, Zhu Shufen\u2019s expression could not help but change. At the beginning, she was willing to marry Jiang Chengxiang for many reasons. One of them was that Jiang Chengxiang lived alone in the county town and did not have to send money home, but the family would send him food from time to time. There was never a shortage of eggs and fish.But now what? Where did the eggs go? What about the fish? Only worthless vegetables were sent!The Jiang family even had a big uncle behaving like a madman.Zhu Shufen had a feeling that she had been deceived, and she was suddenly unhappy.However, although she felt unhappy, Zhu Shufen did not say anything and did not show it, and Butcher Jiang naturally did not know his daughter-in-law\u2019s little thoughts.Seeing his most promising youngest son, Butcher Jiang could not help but complain about the family\u2019s disgusting eldest son.\u201cSon, your big brother is really abominable. Is there any way you can make him more obedient?\u201d Butcher Jiang had talked about every \u201cevil deed\u201d that Eldest Jiang had done and finally asked this.After Jiang Chengxiang got married, he returned to the county town. These days that he finally lived with his wife, he didn\u2019t want to return home.However, although he did not go home, he was still thinking about his family; and in his opinion, even if Eldest Jiang had nearly died once, he would still be weak in the future.As a result . . . he had been causing trouble all these days and had not stopped yet?Eldest Jiang, when did he get so daring?After hearing what Butcher Jiang had to say, Jiang Chengxiang was full of disbelief and asked for more details. And when he heard the whole story clearly, he finally relaxed and said, \u201cDad, don\u2019t worry. This matter is easy to solve.\u201d\u201cIs it really so easy to solve?\u201d Butcher Jiang frowned. \u201cYour eldest brother has become fierce. If things go on like this, we won\u2019t be able to live at home!\u201d\u201cDad, I think he\u2019s just bluffing. None of you got hurt from the beginning to the end, right?\u201d Jiang Chengxiang said. \u201cHe was probably angry in his heart, so he became domineering and threatening at home, but he will still not dare to really do anything.\u201d\u201cEven if he is just bluffing, we have to find a way to deal with him, and we can\u2019t beat him . . .\u201d Butcher Jiang sighed.\u201cWe can scare him too,\u201d said Jiang Chengxiang with a confident look on his face. His eldest brother was just a crude farmhand who couldn\u2019t read or write. In his opinion, it was too easy to deal with such a person.At present, there were two ways to deal with his eldest brother. One is to threaten him to leave and drive him out of the house . . . But that was definitely not possible. What if his eldest brother really agrees in a fit of anger?Although Jiang Chengxiang was not old, he could see things very clearly and naturally knew that it was good for him to leave Eldest Jiang at home.Eldest Jiang was not married and would not have children in the future. Staying at home was for him to help his two brothers and work for a lifetime for free . . . Although this was unfair to his big brother, it was good for him, and people . . . were selfish.Because of this, Jiang Chengxiang did not want to talk about a separation from the family, so he had to use another method, which was definitely easier to use than threatening Eldest Jiang to leave.\u201cHow do you want to scare him?\u201d asked Butcher Jiang.\u201cDad, I know a government officer in the county town,\u201d Jiang Chengxiang began to speak slowly. What ordinary people fear most these days? Wasn\u2019t it the government? Many people obviously had never done anything bad but still did not dare to pass through the gate of the government and prefer to take a long detour.Bringing a government officer back home will certainly frighten his eldest brother.\u201cWould the officer be willing?\u201d When Butcher Jiang heard the words \u201cgovernment officer,\u201d he could not help trembling in his heart.\u201cI\u2019m on good terms with him, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be willing,\u201d Jiang Chengxiang said. The officer he was referring to was the one in charge of the dock. They had drank wine together several times and their friendship was quite good. He was sure the man would agree to do him a favor.What\u2019s more, it\u2019s also a way to get along with others by asking for a little help and giving a red envelope afterwards.Jiang Chengxiang said a few more words to Butcher Jiang and then left with him for lunch.Although Zhu Shufen\u2019s father was a scholar, she was not from a very rich family, so she would do all the work at home. Before Butcher Jiang arrived, she had already prepared lunch.A plate of garlic leaf tofu, a bowl of egg and vegetable soup, and a bowl of fried vegetables looked simple, but because she put more oil than old lady Jiang, the taste of the vegetables was far better than that of old lady Jiang\u2019s.Butcher Jiang was happy and ate three bowls of rice in one breath.It\u2019s a good thing I prepared the evening meal as well while I was cooking lunch today, otherwise I might not have enough to eat, Zhu Shufen thought to herself and became a little unhappier again.When a guest was present, she had to serve the guest first, so she only served herself half a bowl of rice. She thought Butcher Jiang would leave something to eat anyway, but as a result, he was not polite at all and ate everything.Looking at the cleanly scraped out pot, Zhu Shufen, who had not had enough to eat, got mad.How could Jiang Chengxiang not know what his wife was thinking? Instead, he smiled and said, \u201cThose who do manual labor in the countryside eat a lot. My mother can drink four bowls of porridge.\u201dZhu Shufen glared at Jiang Chengxiang and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say your father would bring you eggs every time? Why not this time? I\u2019ve ran out of eggs at home. I need to buy them tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSomething has happened at home recently, but it will be alright in the future . . . Shufen, when you go out to buy meat, buy roast chicken today. I\u2019ll invite someone to a meal in the evening,\u201d said Jiang Chengxiang. He planned on inviting the officer to his house for dinner this evening and go back home tomorrow.His big brother, he had to take care of him.. . .Jiang Zhen did not know that Butcher Jiang had gone to the county town to discuss with Jiang Chengxiang about how to deal with him.He was quite satisfied with his recent life. The mood of the original owner basically did not affect him these days. He had already gained enough understanding of the world, and his relationship with Zhao Jinge was being cultivated well . . . In a few days, he will be completely separated from the Jiang family and would be able to live his own life.Jiang Zhen was in a good mood and had good luck.This morning, he caught a hedgehog while wandering around. This animal was quite common in Hexi Village, but because there was no further process needed in order to be eaten, he planned to take it back to Zhao Jinge and ask him if he wanted it.As a result, halfway there, someone stopped him and wanted to trade fish for the hedgehog.In the south of the Yangtze River, there was a kind of people who had no land of their own, no house of their own, and only had one boat. They lived on boats and earned their living by fish or ferrying. They are called boat people.Jiang Zhen preferred to call them fishermen.Although ordinary people in Hexi Village could catch fish, they did not make a living by catching fish. These fishermen lived entirely by catching fish. Of course, they would also use fishing boats to help people transport goods in order to make money.In the river on this side of Hexi Village, there was such a family of fishermen living on fishing boats. They were a family of a man and a ger in their thirties and two children. They usually caught fish with nets and by putting some earthworms in their special bamboo baskets. They then put the bamboo basket into the river to lead the fish to these bamboo baskets; after the fish went in, they pulled it up.Jiang Zhen had no work to do these days and occasionally went to watch them catching fish, trying to learn how to catch it himself, but he had not spoken to them, so he was somewhat surprised when he was asked to stop.\u201cI\u2019ll give you fish for the hedgehog. Will you trade it for fish?\u201d asked the man on the fishing boat who was in his thirties.\u201cTrade,\u201d Jiang Zhen agreed without hesitation and was a little curious. \u201cWhat do you want to do with the hedgehog?\u201d\u201cA hedgehog is good for the stomach,\u201d the man said. \u201cMy wife has been having a stomach ache a lot lately.\u201dJiang Zhen had seen the man\u2019s wife once, but he only remembered that he was a very thin man and he hadn\u2019t seen his face clearly. Now he knew that this man was going to give the fish to his wife, so he gave the hedgehog to the other person. The man gave him a heavy silver carp weighing several kilos.These days, Jiang Zhen only caught small fish and shrimps, he had never caught such a big fish, so he immediately decided to give the fish to Zhao Jinge to show off.As a result, after a few steps, Jiang Zhen saw a boat stopping by the river. At that time, the Jiang family\u2019s third son and a man dressed like a public servant jumped off the boat.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19 - Keep fightingPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 19 \u2013 Keep fighting\u201cBig brother?\u201d Seeing Jiang Zhen carrying a fish, Jiang Chengxiang cried out uncertainly, showing surprise on his face.On the second day of his marriage, he had seen Jiang Zhen lose his temper, but he didn\u2019t take it too seriously. But now . . . his eldest brother was almost like a different person.Jiang Chengxiang was surprised at his first sight of Jiang Zhen and then was disgusted at the second sight when he saw that his eldest brother was wearing his clothes.Before, he heard from Butcher Jiang that his eldest brother has moved to his house, but he had not thought that the man would wear his clothes. Jiang Chengxiang never liked others touching his things, and for a moment, he was disgusted with Jiang Zhen.\u201cChengxiang, this is your big brother?\u201d the man brought by Jiang Chengxiang looked at Jiang Zhen with a smile.This man\u2019s name was Yang Jiang, and he was indeed a government official.The government officer\u2019s position in Hecheng County was basically handed down from generation to generation, from father to son. Because of this job, he could easily get some oil or water. As a result, government officers generally have a good life, and they often continue to do so for several generations, making them quite rich.But this Yang Jiang was different; he likes to gamble. He always loses all his money and has a bad life. Because of this, when Jiang Chengxiang asked him to help frighten some people, he was willing to come and make some extra money.\u201cYes, this is my eldest brother.\u201d Jiang Chengxiang looked again at Jiang Zhen. \u201cBig Brother, come home with us.\u201d Old Madam Jiang would make a scene after being wronged by Jiang Zhen, but Jiang Chengxiang was reluctant to do so. He did not want the villagers to see this jest.Jiang Zhen took one look at Jiang Chengxiang and another look at the official next to him and frowned.He had a faint feeling that something was wrong.Although he has acted recklessly these days, he has not gone too far. In fact, there were more people who acted more excessively in the countryside than him\u2014drinking, gambling, ruining the family\u2019s property, beating their wives, families driving out old people from their homes and letting them die by themselves, harming neighbors, or stealing chickens . . . In Hexi Village and the villages near Hexi Village, there were many much worse people than him.And for such people, everyone will say a few words at most because most of these people are vicious and no one dared to offend them, so Jiang Zhen never stood up for himself at all, but now . . . What did Jiang Chengxiang want to do coming here with a government officer?Jiang Zhen took a defensive look at Jiang Chengxiang then slowly relaxed. The soldiers always come to subdue any situation, so there is no need for him to hide.With a fish in one hand and a bamboo pole in the other, Jiang Zhen fell far behind Jiang Chengxiang and Yang Jiang while they walked towards the Jiang family house.\u201cYour big brother doesn\u2019t seem easy to mess with,\u201d said Yang Jiang, leaning closer to Jiang Chengxiang.\u201cIt\u2019s just a false pose, big brother Yang. If you take the lead, you will easily take him down,\u201d Jiang Chengxiang complimented Yang Jiang.\u201cOf course.\u201d On Yang Jiang\u2019s face was an expression of gloating. He added, \u201cYesterday\u2019s roast chicken was delicious.\u201d\u201cBig Brother Yang, let\u2019s eat again tonight!\u201d Jiang Chengxiang immediately said that there was a good family roast chicken shop in Hecheng County where the roast chicken was fried in oil and then burned with special brine. The taste was exceptionally delicious and the price was not cheap. However, he was always willing to spend money for good relations with others and did not feel bad about it.When the three of them entered the village, they attracted many people\u2019s eyes because Yang Jiang was dressed in the Yamen official clothes, and because of this, nobody dared to come and say hello.After a short time, they arrived at the Jiang family house.\u201cThird son, you\u2019re back! Your Excellency, please come in!\u201d When old lady Jiang saw Jiang Chengxiang and Yang Jiang coming with him, her face lit up. Then she gave Jiang Zhen a look of pride and disgust.Obviously, these people are going to do something today! Just as Jiang Zhen thought of it, he heard Jiang Chengxiang say, \u201cJiang Zhenwei, you kneel down before your parents!\u201dI guessed it right . . . Jiang Zhen looked at Jiang Chengxiang but did not kneel down.Jiang Zheng did not kneel. Jiang Chengxiang, who wanted to suppress him with this momentum, frowned. He also felt vaguely that something was wrong. But when he saw Jiang Zhen standing there motionless, he thought he felt wrong. He looked at Jiang Zhen in an earnest manner and said, \u201cBig Brother, do you know what you have done wrong?\u201d\u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at Jiang Chengxiang calmly.\u201cBig Brother, you are father and mother\u2019s son. You shouldn\u2019t point a knife at your parents. This is disobedience and lack of filial piety!\u201d Jiang Chengxiang said.\u201cThe punishment for disobedience and lack of filial piety is beheading.\u201d The government official had been watching the drama before him, but at this time, he looked at Jiang Zhen and said that darkly.\u201cDo you have the guts to stab me now, you debt collector!\u201d old Madam Jiang shouted to Jiang Zhen. \u201cTomorrow, I will go to the yamen and tell them that you are disobedient and unfilial. Let the officers arrest you and chop off your head!\u201d\u201cEldest, you\u2019d better admit your mistakes today, or we\u2019ll be rude!\u201d Butcher Jiang also added. After chatting with his youngest son yesterday, he learned that when children were unfilial, the parents could sue their children at the yamen. He did not want his eldest son to die, but he decided to use this method to teach his son a good lesson and make him obedient again.Jiang Zhen knew that these people should only be threatening him. If it was only the Jiang family threatening him, he could certainly make a scene, but now there was a government officer.Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s ability to find the government official showed that he had some connections in the county town. If he made a scene at this time and firmly denied his mistake, the Jiang family may actually sue him for disobedience and unfilial piety, which, in ancient times, was indeed a felony.But to not cause a scene? Did he really want to allow the Jiang family to suppress him?Now that he was not afraid of the government official or charges of disobedience and lack of filial piety, did Jiang Chengxiang have any means to get ahold of him?Many thoughts flashed through Jiang Zhen\u2019s mind. At the same time, the feelings belonging to Eldest Jiang appeared again.There was fear and anger in that mood. The man who had been mistreated by his own parents for more than twenty years still had persistence after his own death.He did not work for a period of time after he had nearly died. He ate a chicken and some eggs at home. Now these people even went after his life regardless of their blood ties . . . You can imagine in how much pain Eldest Jiang was.\u201cWill you be accusing me of disobedience and unfilial piety?\u201d Jiang Zhen raised his head and glanced at the faces of the people in front of him, remembering all their expressions in his heart.\u201cBig Brother, if you keep making trouble, father and mother will sue you for disobedience and for being unfilial!\u201d Jiang Chengxiang said. Everyone was afraid of the yamen in this village. He was clear how afraid everyone would be if caught by the yamen now. He only needed to wait for his elder brother to turn soft.It\u2019s just that things didn\u2019t seem to go the way he thought. Jiang Chengxiang looked at Jiang Zhen with some pride but found that there was no expression of fear on his face and his face was still cold. For some reason, Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s heart gave a thump and his body felt a little cold.\u201cA jinx like you should be caught and beheaded!\u201d old lady Jiang said. Because of the presence of the government official, she was no longer afraid of Jiang Zhen. She even hoped that the government official would really take Eldest Jiang away. Without this jinx she surely would have a better life in the future.Madam Jiang really wanted to kill him . . . When Jiang Zhen saw this, his heart was filled with grief and indignation. This was not his own emotion. What he wanted to do was to spread his full anger.\u201cWell, disobedience is being unfilial, is it? Then I will show you some right now!\u201d Jiang Zhen suddenly said, as soon as his voice fell, he threw the fish in his hand towards old lady Jiang\u2019s face.When the fish fell on old lady Jiang\u2019s face, she couldn\u2019t help screaming. At this time, Jiang Zhen held the sharpened bamboo pole he took with him every day these days and then jabbed it at Zhen Jiang.When the bamboo pole hit old lady Jiang, it directly swept her to the ground. Jiang Zhen stabbed the sharpened end of the pole in Butcher Jiang\u2019s leg.The sharp bamboo pole pierced Butcher Jiang\u2019s leg. The bleeding made him cry out in horror.Jiang Zhen, however, did not show any mercy. He hit him on the shoulder, knocking him to the ground.Jiang Zhen\u2019s sudden anger shocked Jiang Chengxiang and the official, who stood foolishly and couldn\u2019t respond at all. Jiang Zhen was already looking at them by then.Jiang Zhen\u2019s eyes were very cold. Jiang Chengxiang trembled unconsciously after meeting his eyes. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going to accuse me of disobedience and unfilial piety? I\u2019ll just kill you first.\u201d Jiang Zhen sneered and directly stabbed Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s thigh.\u201cAh!\u201d Jiang Chengxiang thigh was stabbed, and a bloodstain suddenly appeared. He looked at Jiang Zheng in horror. He didn\u2019t expect Jiang Zheng to actually do it.\u201cStop it!\u201d Yang Jiang pulled out a knife from his waist and looked at Jiang Zhen in horror. When ordinary people see a government official they became like quails, but this man dared to do it! \u201cDon\u2019t you want to die? I\u2019m going to put you in jail! \u201c\u201cYou want to arrest me? Then I\u2019ll kill myself first.\u201d Jiang Zhen hit Yang Jiang with the bamboo pole.Yang Jiang, with a nearly two feet long waist knife, wanted to cut Jiang Zheng, but Jiang Zheng had already distanced himself from him. How could he cut him down now?As a weapon, the bamboo pole was not comparable to a knife in some respects, but in some ways, it was better than a knife; at least, it was long enough.There was some distance between them. Yang Jiang could not cut him with the knife, but he could hit Yang Jiang with the bamboo pole.Jiang Zhen\u2019s bamboo pole hit the knife in Yang Jiang\u2019s hands, making it directly fly out, then he hit Yang Jiang with the pole again.If it was in modern times, Jiang Zhen would never fight against a police officer similar to that of an ancient yamen officer because it was an easy way to get killed.If he committed a crime in modern times, he would be caught in less than two days, and he couldn\u2019t fight modern weapons through physical force alone. In this case, of course, he couldn\u2019t foolishly confront the police.But these were the ancient times.Although artillery was already used these days, it would only be used in the army. In most places, it was not bad for soldiers in the army to have a knife, and he was not afraid of others who use a knife against him at all!There was not even a camera here, which meant that, even if he committed a crime, as long as he ran far away and was not recognized, he could start over somewhere else.In fact, it was also very simple to run, although in ancient times the traffic was inconvenient, it was also inconvenient for those officials!Of course, Jiang Zhen had no intention of committing a crime or escaping. He was still waiting to marry Zhao Jinge.He now . . . just wanted to beat up these people who didn\u2019t have good eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Remember to thank her in the comment section!Jiang Zhen knew very well that Jiang Chengxiang returned with a yamen official to threaten him into being obedient.But if he didn\u2019t listen; it was not just a threat. They did not hold the slightest affection for him. They did not regard him as a son or brother at all. They just wanted him to work for the Jiang family house. If he refused to work for them, as he did before, they would really go to the yamen to sue him.It was useless for him to give in first and then find fault with them. If he was not careful, this family might kill him, so he will start first.Thinking this way, Jiang Zhen continued to beat Yang Jiang up. He had a proper hand and would not seriously hurt Yang Jiang, but he would definitely make it painful for him.\u201cSpare my life! Spare me. It was Jiang Chengxiang who asked me to scare you. I didn\u2019t mean to arrest you!\u201d Yang Jiang soon began to call for help.He Cheng County had always been peaceful. When he worked as a yamen officer in He Cheng County town, he rarely needed to use a knife, so his skill was naturally very common. At this time, he could not beat Jiang Zhen at all, so he had to keep begging for mercy.Jiang Zhen really stopped, not because he begged for mercy, but because old lady Jiang got up again.Soon the bamboo pole swung again. Jiang Zhen directly swept old lady Jiang to the ground again and glared at Jiang Chengxiang, who wanted to get up and save Yang Jing.Jiang Chengxiang trembled after meeting Jiang Zhen\u2019s cold stare and became too afraid to move. He lay obediently in the mud, surprised and frightened. His older brother, who would not move even when others slapped him on the face, how did he suddenly become so scary? He seemed to have a murderous aura . . .With a sneer, Jiang Zhen picked up Yang Jiang\u2019s knife, stepped on Yang Jing\u2019s chest, and put the sharp knife to Yang Jing\u2019s neck. \u201cYou want to arrest me? Charge me with disobedience and unfilial piety?\u201d\u201cNo no! I\u2019m definitely not going to arrest you!\u201d Yang Jing said and repeatedly begged for mercy, but his heart was full of hatred. He had never suffered such a humiliation since he was a child. When he returned to the county town, he would not allow the Jiang family to look good!Yes, Yang Jing not only hated Jiang Zhen but also the other members of the Jiang family. The leader of the Jiang family was clearly a madman. Jiang Chengxiang also asked him to scare him. What was his intention?Jiang Zhen stepped hard with his foot and sneered, \u201cYou\u2019d better not try to catch me. Otherwise . . . as long as you don\u2019t kill me and let me escape, I\u2019ll find you and tear you apart!\u201d It\u2019s hard to beat a group of yamen officers, but at the same time, it was easy to escape from a group of yamen officers. All you had to do was run faster than them, so Jiang Zhen was not worried at all.Yang Jing, whose chest was trampled on, felt that he couldn\u2019t breathe. Hearing Jiang Zhen say so, his mind became even more surprised.This Jiang Zhen was quite capable. If he caught him, and he ran away . . .\u201cNo, it\u2019s too easy to chop a person in eight pieces. I always prefer to watch people cry and beg. If I put bamboo sticks under your fingernails, your expression would look so beautiful.\u201d Jiang Zhen deliberately showed a cold smile to Yang Jiang\u2019s face and bluffed, \u201cOf course, it would not be enough. Skinning is interesting. I will tie you up and start peeling from the back of your neck to your ass, then slowly peel the remaining skin off with a knife . . . Don\u2019t worry. Although you\u2019re a little fat, making you difficult to peel, I am quite skillful. I will skin you cleanly.\u201dWith that, Jiang Zhen\u2019s eyes wandered around Yang Jiang\u2019s body, as if weighing where to start peeling.Yang Jing, who had always thought about getting revenge afterwards, suddenly, before Jiang Zhen\u2019s gaze, wouldn\u2019t dare to think about anything anymore. \u201cYou . . .\u201d He shivered, and at last, he only made one shaky sound. After seeing the sharp knife for killing pigs that was at Jiang Zhen\u2019s waist, he was even more shaken, so he was incontinent.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t think it was enough. \u201cRest assured, after dealing with you, I won\u2019t let go of your family . . . I have this iron hook. It is used to hook up the pig upside down after killing it. It\u2019s convenient to open the stomach to take out the intestines. Tell me, if I hook up your parents with this iron hook . . . will it be fun?\u201dWhen Jiang Zhen went on a mission in the past, he met some abnormal people and learned some of their expressions. He added some details of the ancient punishment he had seen with his comrades in arms, even describing it in detail. If he had really done such a thing, it would be really shocking and scary.Just saying it with his own mouth, he felt disgusted, easily making people scared of him . . .Yang Jing has been so frightened that he was about to faint. Butcher Jiang, his wife, and Jiang Chengxiang lay motionless on the ground.How could they not have known before that Eldest Jiang was so terrible? If they had known this, they would have never offended him.\u201cAt your age, you should have children, right? In fact, there are many ways to deal with them . . .\u201d Jiang Zhen continued to recall all kinds of ancient punishments to frighten them. At the same time, he made a shallow cut on Yang Jiang\u2019s face with his knife.It didn\u2019t matter if it was Yang Jing\u2019s parents, wife or children. Although he liked gambling and playing around and was usually not good to his family, they were still his family after all. Hearing Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, he fainted directly after thinking about his wife and his pale and plump son.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t care about him anymore and went directly to Jiang Chengxiang. \u201cThird brother, I have always remembered that every time you got into trouble when you were a child, you said it was my fault. Making problems for me. Do you remember? Once Aunt Huang gave me a qingming dumpling. I thought it would be delicious, but you snatched it, threw it on the ground, and stepped on it several times. Later, you told our parents that I robbed your dumpling. In the end, father slapped me twice, making me dizzy for half a month . . .\u201dJiang Zhen said a lot of things and smiled softly at Jiang Chengxiang. \u201cThose things, I originally intended to let them go, but you wanted to kill me . . . Don\u2019t you think I should teach you a lesson? How about cutting off the thing down there and serving it to you to eat?\u201dWith that, Jiang Zhen\u2019s knife scratched Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s lower abdomen.Jiang Chengxiang almost fainted as well. Jiang Zhen smiled gently, but the more he smiled, the more frightened he felt.Old lady Jiang never treated eldest Jiang as her own son, but she was very fond of Jiang Chengwen and Jiang Chengxiang. Seeing and hearing this, she became even more afraid. She wanted to save her youngest son. She suddenly stood up and rushed towards Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen had been paying close attention to them. Before she got close, he kicked her and grabbed her bun, cutting it off with his knife. \u201cIf you are so restless, I\u2019ll cut off your head next time!\u201dWhen Jiang Zhen cut her hair bun off, old Lady Jiang thought she was going to have her head cut off. She was so scared that her whole body turned soft, making her unable to move for a while.\u201cI didn\u2019t want to do anything to you. Why did you have to fight me?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at the people around him who have fallen to the ground and sighed.When the Jiang family heard this, they all thought that he was lying to make himself feel good, but Jiang Zhen knew that he was telling the truth.He used the knife to scare the Jiang family, which was all a bluff. From the beginning to the end, he didn\u2019t plan to do anything to the Jiang family.Even though he had been thinking about splitting up, he didn\u2019t intend to take anything from the Jiang family.He was not eldest Jiang, but Jiang Zhen. He was a foreign soul, and he himself felt he was not qualified to get money from the Jiang family.According to Jiang Zhen\u2019s original plan, he wanted to make some trouble at the Jiang family house, eat and drink well for a period of time, and let eldest Jiang rest peacefully after appeasing him, then separate from the Jiang family, and leave the Jiang family house to find Zhao Jinge.He didn\u2019t want the fields of the Jiang family; he didn\u2019t want anything from the Jiang family. In his own future, he would leave on his own.It\u2019s just that the Jiang family insisted on giving him such a gift.Covering his chest, Jiang Zhen felt the tumultuous anger of eldest Jiang. Jiang Zhen felt really disgusted with these Jiang family members.He slapped Yang Jing face with the back of his knife to wake him up. Jiang Zhen said to the people in the room, \u201cI have food and drink now, and I live a comfortable life, so I didn\u2019t kill you to make trouble for myself, but you are even trying to kill me . . . Since I don\u2019t have a good life, I\u2019m not afraid of you. We can die together!\u201d\u201cAll the people in this family will be buried with me. No one can escape! Third, I know where your father-in-law Zhu Xiucai and his family live. When I kill the Jiang family, I will kill them too.\u201dJiang Chengxiang looked at Jiang Zhen in horror, but Jiang Zhen ignored him and stepped on Yang Jing again. \u201cAnd you just want someone to arrest me. Let\u2019s see who will die then!\u201dAt the beginning, Yang Jing really wanted to find someone to catch Jiang Zhen after he got away from here. But at this time, he no longer dared to have this idea.He could not 100 percent guarantee that he would catch Jiang Zhen and kill him. If this man had a chance to escape, his family . . .Damn, Jiang Chengxiang! He even let him deal with such an evil star. This is clearly trying to kill me!Yang Jing did not dare to hate Jiang Zhen anymore. Now, he hated Jiang Chengxiang, who dragged him into this mess. Without Jiang Chengxiang, he would be eating and drinking in the county town at this moment!All the people in this room were afraid of what Jiang Zhen would do. They were relieved when they heard Jiang Zhen say he would not kill them. Just then, outside the Jiang family house came the voice of the village head, Jiang Ping, \u201cEldest Jiang, what are you trying to do? Stop it!\u201dJiang Chengwen, the second son of the Jiang family, was not only lazy but also timid. When Jiang Chengxiang and Butcher Jiang agreed to frighten Jiang Zhen, he didn\u2019t want to participate. Instead, he kept watching while hiding.Then he saw Jiang Zhen knock everyone down.He was so scared and frightened. He didn\u2019t dare to go in and try to save them. So he ran to the village and called over many strong men and the village head, Jiang Ping.Jiang Zhen had been very calm these days. Although he had threatened some members of the Jiang family before, he didn\u2019t really hurt anyone. People in the village were not particularly afraid of him. After Jiang Chengwen went out to call people over, there came a large number of people carrying bolts, poles, or other things.The door of the Jiang house was opened, and the scene inside became clear at a glance. When Jiang Ping saw it, he immediately became startled.Old lady Jiang\u2019s hair was all over the ground. Butcher Jiang and Chengxiang were wounded on their legs. A man dressed as a yamen officer was trampled under Jiang Zhen\u2019s feet. This . . .\u201cEldest Jiang, you are crazy. You even fought against an official!\u201d Jiang Ping was frightened. If he offended a yamen officer, this meant offending the government. When people start to have that opinion about Hexi Village, their whole village would be miserable!\u201cSo what if I just did it?\u201d Jiang Zhen pulled up Yang Jing from the ground, not afraid of the large group of villagers outside. \u201cWhat are you doing around me? Don\u2019t try to catch me, or I\u2019ll slit his throat with a knife and kill him.\u201dJiang Zhen took Yang Jing as a hostage, which proved to be very useful. Jiang Ping and the villagers surrounding the Jiang family did not dare to do anything at all.\u201cI\u2019m telling you, I, Jiang Zhen, am a madman. You\u2019d better not provoke me, or I\u2019ll kill you!\u201d Jiang Zhen said. \u201cOf course, it is troublesome to kill you one by one. What if I took the knife to the county yamen and cut down people with the knife and told the town lord that all the people in our village took part in it?\u201dIn ancient times, if one person committed a crime, it would bring bad luck to the whole family and even to the whole village.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21 - I want to separate from this familyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 21 \u2013 I want to separate from this familyPeople in Hexi Village were frightened by Jiang Zhen.Some of them were also brave and ruthless, but none of them were as reckless as Jiang Zhen.Go to the yamen? How dare he even think about it!The villagers in Hexi Village saw that Jiang Zhen\u2019s temperament had changed. They could not provoke him again, so they just wanted to stay far away from him to avoid getting involved.\u201cEldest Jiang, if you have something to say . . .\u201d Jiang Ping, the Hexi Village head, said in a soft voice. He really thought that Jiang Zhen had become crazy and turned into a madman . . . They\u2019d better not mess with him.\u201cIsn\u2019t that what I was saying to you?\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled in a friendly way to the people before him.But those villagers of Hexi Village didn\u2019t find his smile friendly at all and thought that this smile was horrible, making some people even unconsciously lower their heads.The event on this side of the Jiang family was even greater than the last time, and the people in the village basically came to watch the excitement and tightly surrounded the Jiang family house.Ordinary people would certainly be afraid when seeing this scene, but Jiang Zhen was calm.He was not afraid of these villagers. These people thought that the life of the yamen officer was in their hands. But regardless, he still had the ability to climb the roof and escape. Of course, he didn\u2019t want to be a fugitive, and he always wanted to live a good life in the village. It was expected, as he had now found someone who was willing to let him in.It was a pity that, at this time, there had to be such a scene, messing up all his plans.\u201cEldest Jiang, can you let the official go?\u201d Jiang Ping asked again. Jiang Zhen\u2019s knife reached Yang Jing\u2019s neck, making him shiver. Jiang Ping was afraid that Jiang Zhen would accidentally hurt Yang Jing. This jinx who was able to do anything to his parents and dared to fight against a yamen officer, they couldn\u2019t let him really kill people!\u201cI can let him go, but I have conditions,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.\u201cElder Brother, if you have any conditions, just say them. Just don\u2019t kill anyone!\u201d Jiang Chengxiang hurriedly said.Just before, Jiang Zhen stabbed him in the thigh with the bamboo pole, and he was bleeding, but his wound was not very serious. In fact, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t want to kill, so he naturally was lenient.However, although this wound was not very serious, Jiang Chengxiang now had that feeling of \u201cmy life is over.\u201dWho was Yang Jing? This was the man who he had tried hard to get close to! It didn\u2019t matter if Eldest Jiang beat him, but he beat Yang Jing . . . I don\u2019t want to think about it. He knew that Yang Jing would come to seek problems with him in the future . . . Now, Jiang Chengxiang was only hoping that Yang Jing would spare him in the future for the sake of his efforts to save him now.\u201cI already said it.\u201d Jiang Zhen chuckled. \u201cI want to separate from you.\u201dSeparation? Jiang Chengxiang was stunned. Before, he had thought of threatening his eldest brother with separation, but he didn\u2019t expect that his big brother\u2019s condition would be the same after he had taken advantage.Why would his eldest brother want to separate from them? If he left the Jiang family, where would he go to eat in the future?Now, he had a place to eat but was still holding Yang Jing hostage to force them to separate their families, mostly trying to split up their family fields . . . Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s eyes widened suddenly, and he looked at Jiang Zhen in horror.If the land of the Jiang family become divided by Jiang Zhen, he was afraid that they would soon change from a wealthy family to a very ordinary one in the village. And he will certainly not be able to live such a comfortable life in the future.\u201cAll right, separate and get out of this house!\u201d old lady Jiang shouted, wanting to get rid of this star of disaster.\u201cShut up!\u201d Butcher Jiang shouted at his wife. Even in this situation, this woman dared to shout at Eldest Jiang. She simply didn\u2019t want to live any more.At the sight of his eldest son with a knife on the yamen officer\u2019s neck, Butcher Jiang felt great regret.He always knew that his wife was very bad to his eldest son, but he indulged it because he was not close to his eldest son, and he gave up on him a long time ago.It cost money to marry and raise a son. He thought it was enough to have two sons to start their own family and inherit the family name. So he just didn\u2019t care about his eldest son, allowing him to be treated badly and become an old bachelor. He intended to allow him to work for the family for the rest of his life. This way, when his two younger brothers separate from each other, they could get a little more money and not become poorer because of the property division. The eldest son, because he would not have his own children, of course, wouldn\u2019t need to be given a share of the property. As a result . . . things reached this point.If he had known this, he would have been nicer to his eldest son.\u201cEldest, the separation is always a matter of good discussion . . .\u201d Butcher Jiang eased his breath. He didn\u2019t want to become separated from Jiang Zhen, but he didn\u2019t dare to stop him. He hoped that Jiang Zhen would ask for less things.Yes, Butcher Jiang has decided to split up the family. He didn\u2019t dare to stay at home with such a lunatic.\u201cBig Brother, what do you want?\u201d Jiang Chengxiang asked. As long as he thought about Jiang Zhen splitting the property, his heart became painful to the point of it dripping blood. But he must agree with Jiang Zhen\u2019s request in order to save Yang Jing. After all, this was the only way to make Yang Jing less angry with him.Jiang Zhen could naturally see the thoughts of the Jiang family and found it somehow funny. These people . . . they really deserved it.If they settled quietly down, he would leave the Jiang house in a month\u2019s time. Although they would lose a laborer, they would not lose money . . . But now. . . Now he should get some benefits from the Jiang family, and as for the yamen officer . . . it was enough to let the Jiang family drink the pot they made themselves.\u201cLet\u2019s divide the family like other families do,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.In Hexi Village, there was no rule about parents dividing the family property. When their sons become another family\u2019s relatives, they would divide their families. But when a family had several sons, the family property will be divided into several parts. Then they will only set the rules on how much food and money each son will give to their elderly.According to these rules, Jiang Zhen can receive something after dividing the five mu of paddy field and six or seven mu of dry land. Even if Butcher Jiang and his wife would share money, so much land was already worth a lot of money.\u201cEldest, you\u2019re not even married. You can\u2019t do that.\u201d Butcher Jiang said in a low voice that all the bachelors in the village live with their brothers . . . Of course, he was mainly reluctant to give up land to Jiang Zhen. The land price on this side of Hecheng County was high. One mu of paddy field can be sold for 22 silver coins or more, and the dry land can be sold for 15 silver coins at least. Jiang Zhen wanting such a big share is simply going too far!Old Madam Jiang was even more reluctant. In her opinion, Jiang Zhen was born by her, so it was her right to beat and kill him. Why should she give him anything? But before she could say anything, Jiang Chengxiang covered her mouth.\u201cIf you didn\u2019t let me get married, how could I be married?\u201d Jiang Zhen sneered. Who knows how much Eldest Jiang wanted a wife?Butcher Jiang felt regret again. Why didn\u2019t he marry off Jiang Zhen? That way, they not only would get a bride price, but also push this disaster to someone else.\u201cBut if you don\u2019t want to split it that way, we can do another division,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.This so-called another division is not going to give you more, is it? Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s heart beat like a drum, but Butcher Jiang asked, \u201cWhat kind of division?\u201d\u201cI was born and raised by you, but you have killed me once before, and it will cost you,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. \u201cBefore I was 15 years old, I had been eating at home but also needed to work. I did a lot of work . . . This work should be worth your favor of parenting. I don\u2019t want anything else from you.\u201dWhat does Jiang Zhen mean? He doesn\u2019t want anything?The people present looked at Jiang Zhen puzzled. At this time, Jiang Zhen added, \u201cAfter I was 15 years old, I was basically doing all the work in the family fields. You can say that I was working as a long-term worker for you. It has been a whole decade since then. I don\u2019t want anything else. Just pay me for my long-term job.\u201dIn Hexi Village, the head of the family should cover long-term workers\u2019 meals. In addition, he should also pay for their work.Zhao Jinge worked as a long-term worker in Zhao Dahu\u2019s house. No matter what the food was, Zhao Dahu\u2019s house must give him some food. In addition, they will also pay him for his work at the end of the year.This year\u2019s copper coins have a value similar to the dollar before Jiang Zhen\u2019s crossing. According to the memory of Eldest Jiang, pork is sold for about a dozen copper coins a kilo, whole grain is a few copper coins a kilo.A silver coin or two are worth about a thousand dollars.Of course, in view of the imperfection of the ancient market, people basically did not have any money in their hands these days, so the wages were generally very low. It was very kind of a host family to pay a long-term worker for one year\u2019s work five or six silver coins. Generally, they would only pay three or four silver coins and the rest was paid in copper money and grain.\u201cI have been a long-term worker for ten years, but I don\u2019t want much. Just give me 40 silver coins. In addition to farming, I have done a lot of work at home. You have to give me for that another five sacks of grain,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. He didn\u2019t want to have anything more to do with the Jiang family in the future, and he didn\u2019t want to provide for old Butcher Jiang and his wife in their old age. Naturally, it would be impossible for Butcher Jiang to divide his family property equally, so he might as well draw a clear line and leave.Jiang Zhen sincerely didn\u2019t want much. He can only buy two mu of paddy field for 40 silver coins. People in Hexi Village all thought he was very kind, but the Jiang family didn\u2019t seem to be very happy.They had thought of Jiang Zhen as a long-term free worker for the rest of their lives! How could they possibly let Jiang Zhen leave with 40 silver coins and five sacks of grain? 40 silver coins! Where do they get so much money?However, even if they don\u2019t want to see Jiang Zhen\u2019s face anymore, when they looked at Yang Jing in his grasp, they could only compromise.\u201cBig Brother, we\u2019ll give you everything you want. Just let go of Brother Yang quickly!\u201d Jiang Chengxiang agreed to Jiang Zhen directly.\u201cI can\u2019t do that,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.\u201cYou want to go back on it?\u201d Jiang Chengxiang was surprised.\u201cOf course not,\u201d said Jiang Zhen, \u201cbut you wanted to hurt me this time. I must get compensation for it. On the west side of the village, there is a thatched hut. It should also be given to me. In addition, you will renovate the thatched hut for me and clean it up! When you have made it livable for me, I\u2019ll let him go!\u201d said Jiang Zhen, patting Yang Jing\u2019s face with his knife.Before, Jiang Zhen dared to live in the Jiang family house because the Jiang family didn\u2019t have the ability to kill him. Even if they wanted to poison him, they couldn\u2019t get the colorless and tasteless poison in order for him not to find out. But now, he had offended a yamen official, so he had to prevent others from plotting against him and couldn\u2019t live with the Jiang family any longer.Because of this, Jiang Zhen directly asked for the separation from the family. As for the Jiang family, let them make a house for him . . .He offended a lot of people, and in order not to affect Zhao Jinge, after the separation, he can\u2019t live in Zhao\u2019s\u2019 house immediately. He can only live alone for now.Thinking that his relationship with Zhao Jinge might be forced into secrecy and the marriage would need to be postponed, Jiang Zhen\u2019s mood suddenly became even worse, and at the same time, he gave Jiang Chengxiang a sinister look.Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s heart shook, and he became worried. The house in the west of the village was really run-down. It will take a lot of time to clean it up. If Jiang Zhen doesn\u2019t let Yang Jing go during this period of time, he was afraid Yang Jing would suffer and hate him..But now, what can they do but listen to Jiang Zhen?\u201cJiang Chengxiang, what are you still doing here? Go and get that house ready!\u201d Yang Jing shouted. He still had a knife near his neck. The Jiang family needed to hurry up and get things done!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22 - The Jiang family raise moneyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22 \u2013 The Jiang family raise moneyJiang Zhen tied Yang Jing\u2019s upper body firmly with a rope and took Yang Jing into the kitchen. Then he ate the biggest meal since arriving to this world. After all, after so much trouble, he was hungry.Old lady Jiang had already prepared lunch a long time ago. It was probably because Jiang Chengxiang would come back today and bring the yamen official back that she made it quite rich.A pot of delicious white rice was cooked in the big iron wok, and on top of the steamer rack was a bowl of bacon, a bowl of steamed eggs, a bowl of garlic, and uncooked green vegetable tofu next to it.Jiang Zhen ate an egg every day these days. At night, he and Zhao Jinge would eat some small fish and shrimps together, but they haven\u2019t eaten meat for many days. When he saw the bowl of bacon cut into thin slices and steamed, he smelled the aroma of meat and felt he could eat the whole pot of rice with bacon.With chopsticks, he stuffed a piece of bacon into his mouth and immediately got a bowl of rice.Those little fish and shrimps that are boiled without oil and salt, they really don\u2019t taste good. Although he ate them every day for his own body\u2019s sake, he has been fed up with them for some time, but this bacon is different . . .With bacon, Jiang Zhen ate two bowls of rice in one breath before he reluctantly put the chopsticks down. Drinking porridge all year round, Eldest Jiang\u2019s stomach has shrunk, so he could have two more bowls of rice, but eating too much would affect his actions. So in the end, he endured it.Anyway, with the yamen officer in his hands, he didn\u2019t have to worry about not having enough to eat.During Jiang Zhen\u2019s meal, in the drying yard outside the Jiang house, the Jiang family were discussing with the village head and some other villagers what to do next.All of them had the same ambition to not let the outside world know that Jiang Zhen had kidnapped a yamen officer, let alone report it to the other officials. If they angered Jiang Zhen, Jiang Zhen would make things even worse!In this case, they could only try their best to meet Jiang Zhen\u2019s conditions.\u201cForty silver coins! Even if our family sell me we would not receive 40 silver coins!\u201d Old lady Jiang sat on the ground crying for help. She really didn\u2019t want to pay.The Jiang family had a good life, and their family was well off, but 40 silver coins. . . they couldn\u2019t take it out at the moment.A few months ago, their family still had 60 silver coins, but Jiang Chengxiang took 30 for the bride price, and spent another 20 to buy all kinds of things in order to be able to marry decently. In this moment, old lady Jiang only had 7 or 8 silver coins in her hands.\u201cI still have some silver at home. I\u2019ll get it later. We need to gather enough money to give him anyway,\u201d Jiang Chengxiang said. After all, Yang Jing was still in Jiang Zhen\u2019s hands.\u201cThird, how much money do you have?\u201d Butcher Jiang asked.\u201cI don\u2019t have much money in my hands, but Shufen does. I should be able to get 10 silver coins,\u201d Jiang Chengxiang said. His work pay in the county town was not low, and he received two silver coins every month, but he had only worked for two years in total, so he naturally hadn\u2019t saved much silver. When he married Zhu Shufen, the Zhu family originally set the bride price at 40 silver coins, but old lady Jiang was only willing to pay 30, so he had to pay the remaining 10 silver coins himself.In the end he had no money, but Zhu Shufen did.Butcher Jiang immediately became upset. \u201cYou have only 10 silver coins. Your mother and your second brother are estimated to have 10 silver coins together. Where can we find 40 silver coins?\u201d\u201cThis knife killer is trying to kill us! How can you be paid for working for your own family?\u201d When old lady Jiang heard Eldest Jiang expose his family, she cried even more. She didn\u2019t want to take money out at all.In the past, Jiang Chengxiang would certainly coax old Madam Jiang at this time, but today he was not in the mood at all.Bowing to the people around him, Jiang Chengxiang said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, our family can\u2019t take out 40 silver coins at this moment. I wonder if we can borrow some from you?\u201d When he discussed this matter publicly, he had already decided to borrow money from the people around him.All the people in the village were here. If one family lent some, the other families would lend too. As long as they raised the money now, they would be able to repay it later.\u201cChengxiang, I\u2019ll lend you five silver coins,\u201d the village head Jiang Ping said. \u201cI\u2019m just a farmer. There are still several little boys in my family. I can\u2019t take out any more.\u201dIf he was not the village head, and if he was not scared that Eldest Jiang would kill the yamen officer, Jiang Ping would not take out five silver coins.Obviously, it was the Jiang family who was so bad to Eldest Jiang that they forced him to become a madman. How could they still be allowed to not take out the money?When Jiang Ping opened his mouth, several other Jiang family members more of less agreed to lend money. Most of them were willing to lend 2 or 3 silver coins, and a few \u2013 only 1 or 2.In a short time, including the Jiang family\u2019s own 20 silver coins, they put together 37 or 38 silver coins.Those in the village who had a good relationship with the Jiang family were willing to lend money, but those who had a very general relationship with them were unwilling to do so. Who knows how long it would take for the Jiang family to repay the money when they borrowed so much this time?However, even if they were unwilling to lend money, they were willing to contribute with something else. A villager who often went to work at the dock said, \u201cJiang Chengxiang, my family is poor, and I don\u2019t have any money, but I have a lot of strength. That shabby thatched hut in the west of the village is completely uninhabitable. I am afraid you will need to rebuild the walls before moving in. I\u2019m good at it.\u201d\u201cHe takes money and still asks for the house. That bastard really has a thick face!\u201d old lady Jiang cursed again.The land in the west of the village was neither large nor fertile. It was usually planted with vegetables and beans, and the thatched cottage had been uninhabitable for a long time. For the Jiang family, neither of these two things were worth anything, but even so, old lady Jiang was reluctant to give them to Jiang Zhen.In fact, Butcher Jiang was also reluctant, but he was really afraid of Jiang Zhen . . . With a sigh, Butcher Jiang took some people to the west of the village to have a look. But before he could speak, he saw Jiang Zhen dragging Yang Jing out of the kitchen.\u201cIf I had known that bastard would be so hateful I would have given birth to him in the toilet and drowned him in a basin of water!\u201d Old lady Jiang didn\u2019t see Jiang Zhen, so she still scolded him, \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he just die? His life is like a plague!\u201d\u201cStop talking!\u201d Butcher Jiang shouted at old lady Jiang and looked at Jiang Zhen nervously.Jiang Zhen pulled Yang Jing and looked at the people outside with a smile. When old lady Jiang saw him, her voice stopped abruptly, as if she was being strangled.\u201cI remembered that the cottage was too dilapidated, and it would take a lot of effort to renovate it. You\u2019d better build for me a new house next to it. There should be two big houses facing south, and there should be no shortage of iron pots in the thatched house facing north . . .\u201d Jiang Zhen made a lot of demands, and finally said, \u201cYou\u2019d better not try cutting corners. If you don\u2019t do a good job, I may have to cut off a few pieces of meat from this official.\u201dAfter that, Jiang Zhen took a knife and made a few cuts on Yang Jing\u2019s face.Yang Jing, who had his face cut open by Jiang Zhen, which made his whole face bloody, looked extremely miserable and let people believe in Jiang Zhen\u2019s words.This evil star really dared to cut human flesh!\u201cElder Brother, we will build the house for you. If you have something to say, just say it, but don\u2019t be impulsive . . . ,\u201d Jiang Chengxiang hurriedly said and felt deep regret. If he had known that his eldest brother was such a man, he would not have offended him.\u201cIf you want me to talk well, then hurry up and do something!\u201d Jiang Zhen said coldly. \u201cBy the way, my household registration, make an independent one for me. I don\u2019t want to have any relationship with your family!\u201dSeeing Jiang Zhen\u2019s fierce appearance, Jiang Chengxiang subconsciously stepped back a few steps.Jiang Zhen was in a good mood when he looked at his doglike look. But when he looked up, he unexpectedly saw Zhao Jinge looking at him outside the crowd.Jiang Zhen: \u201c. . .\u201dHe was going to tell his Jinge that he\u2019s actually a very reasonable person. Was it too late?Jiang Zhen was a little worried but soon his heart calmed down. Zhao Jinge looked at him worriedly without a trace of disgust or hate.He knew that his Jinge liked him very much and would not hate him.Jiang Zhen wanted to laugh. He coughed twice before he could contain his laughter. In the end, he didn\u2019t show a sinister expression anymore to frighten people; instead, he pushed the tied up Yang Jing into Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house and said to the people outside, \u201cI\u2019ll sleep for a while. You\u2019d better get things done for me quickly!\u201dWith that, Jiang Zhen slammed the door shut.Zhao Jinge looked at the closed door worriedly. Jiang Zhen, that guy actually stirred trouble with the yamen officer. Is he going to be ok?Zhao Jinge was working for the Zhao Dahu family as usual today, but when he was halfway through his work, he suddenly heard that something had happened to the Jiang family.What happened to the Jiang family? Will Jiang Zhen be alright? Even if he didn\u2019t come to talk to him, he would always walk a few laps in front of him. At noon, Jiang Zhen, who would usually come to call him for dinner, didn\u2019t even show his shadow today. Zhao Jinge could not help but worry.No longer in the mood to work, he informed the Zhao Dahu family and went back to the village, only to see the doorway of the Jiang family surrounded by a lot of villagers.Before he could find out anything, Zhao Jinge saw Jiang Zhen come out of the hall with a yamen officer, and it was the yamen officer who had suffered a lot . . .What\u2019s going on here?Zhao Jinge watched Jiang Zhen enter Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house and asked a ger who had come to see the excitement.\u201cIt seems that the third brother Jiang brought a yamen officer back home and wanted to put the eldest Jiang in jail. As a result, the eldest Jiang caught the yamen officer.\u201d The ger looked uneasily at Zhao Jinge, who was almost like a man, and sighed. \u201cWhat can be done now? There is a person who fought a yamen officer in our village. Do you think those government officials, who will come to our village, will collect more taxes in the future?\u201d\u201cThis eldest Jiang is too much. He not only fought against his father, mother, and brothers, he even started a fight against the yamen officer!\u201d someone interrupted next to them.\u201cYes, this man is too much! I don\u2019t think old lady Jiang is wrong either. He\u2019s really a jinx. No wonder old lady Jiang wanted to find a yamen officer to catch him,\u201d someone whispered.\u201cKeep your voice down and don\u2019t let that evil star hear you!\u201d someone whispered timidly.All of them lived together. Until now, none of them had been afraid of Jiang Zhen.People in the village were worried about offending the people in the yamen and getting in trouble. But when Zhao Jinge heard their words, he was worried about Jiang Zhen and was disgusted with the Jiang family.What should he do now? Should he visit Jiang Zhen? Help him out a little bit?\u201cJinge, what are you doing here? Come home with me.\u201d Zhao Liu also came to see the commotion. Unexpectedly, she saw her own son here. She took Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand, took a few steps forward, and said, \u201cEldest Jiang is crazy. He even fought with the yamen officer. Let\u2019s go back quickly, so we won\u2019t be caught in this trouble.\u201dZhao Jinge saw his mother\u2019s thin body tremble, so he stopped himself from walking toward Jiang Zhen and turned back.\u201cJinge, don\u2019t go out with Eldest Jiang anymore and don\u2019t take his fish. We can\u2019t afford to offend such evil stars.\u201d Zhao Liu dragged her son home. After walking for a long time, she said this to her son.My son has been very close to Eldest Jiang these days, but he can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201cMother, he\u2019s not a bad guy.\u201d Zhao Jinge could not help defending Jiang Zhen.\u201cMother saw it today. He can kill his own father. . . We can\u2019t afford to have such a person in our family. It\u2019s better to stay far away.\u201d Then Zhao Liu added, \u201cAnd . . . no one in our village likes him now.\u201d They could never go against the villagers.Zhao Jinge moved his lips but remained silent. For the sake of his parents, he can\u2019t go to meet Jiang Zhen in the daytime. But. . . why not go over at night?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23 - Stockholm syndromePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 23 \u2013 Stockholm syndromeJiang Zhen was taking a nap.He recently developed the habit of taking naps. He fell asleep soon after lying down, and he slept particularly soundly.Noticing this, Yang Jing, who was tied to a box by him, finally put his heart at ease. He could finally take a breath.Before that, everything was a nightmare for him. How could he be so unlucky as to provoke such an evil star?Yang Jing was no longer afraid, seeing Jiang Zhen sleeping so soundly. He inevitably raised his hopes up. He . . . Could he take this opportunity to escape?He really didn\u2019t want to stay with this man. He just wanted to run away and never come back.As a yamen officer, Yang Jing often dealt with the villains in the county town and learned some skills from them, such as escaping from ropes . . . Of course, he was not particularly skilled.It took him nearly half an hour to free one of his hands. When Yang Jing finally untied the rope on his hand, Jiang Zhen was still asleep.As long as he could escape from this house, he could run away . . . Yang Jing slowly stood up and moved to the door . . .At the same moment, he suddenly felt a cold wind blow pass by his ear, then a cold light flashed, making a bang sound, and a knife was stuck beside the hand he wanted to use to open the door.Looking at the sharp knife, Yang Jing trembled uncontrollably. He slowly turned his head to look at the bed in the room. Sure enough, he saw Jiang Zhen, who had been sleeping in the bed a moment ago, his eyes open, looking at him, grinning like a demon. \u201cWant to escape?\u201dYang Jing\u2019s legs turned soft, his body directly fell to the ground. It had not been easy to gather the courage to try to escape.He didn\u2019t dare to run; he would never try to run away again!If he ran again, the man would stick the knife in his head!Jiang Zhen, who revealed his unique skill of throwing knives, yawned and got up from the bed.He looked lazy, but when he walked to Yang Jing\u2019s side, he suddenly burst out, kicking Yang Jing directly to the ground and even kicking him several times in a row.There were three reasons why Jiang Zhen never showed mercy when he hit Yang Jing. One of the reasons was that Yang Jing was not a good man. On one occasion, when Eldest Jiang went to deliver things to Jiang Chengxiang, he saw him extorting merchants and punching and kicking a farmer who went to the city to sell eggs.The second reason was that this man was round and fat, making him resistant to beating . . . In ancient times, the medical conditions were not good. Old lady Jiang, who he had kicked before, was thin, making him afraid that he would accidentally kill her, but there was no need to worry about accidentally killing Yang Jing.As for the third reason . . . After he beat this man so many times, he would certainly be afraid to cause him trouble in the future, but he would definitely try to cause trouble for the other members of the Jiang family.Jiang Zhen was very happy to make some trouble for the Jiang family.After leaving a lot of footprints on Yang Jing, Jiang Zhen pulled the knife off the door and patted Yang Jiang on the head. \u201cBe obedient, okay?\u201dYang Jing nodded repentantly.Jiang Zhen had enough sleep. He found a clean set of clothes and put them on. Then he kicked Yang Jing again. \u201cStand up and go out with me.\u201dYang Jing\u2019s legs were so soft that he could not stand up after trying several times. Jiang Zhen frowned, lifted him up, and went to the patio of the Jiang family house.The Jiang family went to work, and the rest of the villagers didn\u2019t dare to wander in front of him. So now there was no one here . . . No, there were some people actually.\u201cCome out!\u201d Jiang Zhen shouted towards the house.There was no movement in the house, and no one came out. Jiang Zhen became impatient. \u201cIf you don\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll kick down the door!\u201dAs soon as Jiang Zhen said this, someone came out of the room trembling. She called out with a pale little face, \u201cBig-Big Brother . . .\u201dThe person hiding in the house was Jiang Xiaomei. She thought that as long as she didn\u2019t make any noise, Jiang Zhen would not find her. Unexpectedly, she was still discovered by Jiang Zhen . . .Jiang Xiaomei lowered her head and trembled in fear of being hit by Jiang Zhen. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t hit her but said, \u201cGo boil water!\u201dHearing those words, Jiang Xiaomei breathed a sigh of relief and hurried off to boil the water.Jiang Zhen knocked Yang Jing on the head with the back of his knife and let him lie in the corner. He found the fish he had traded for the hedgehog this morning and picked it up.He scraped off the scales with the knife, dug out the fish intestines, and chopped them into pieces . . .Seeing Jiang Zhen cutting fish with the knife, Yang Jing couldn\u2019t help lowering his head and hunching his shoulders in fear that Jiang Zhen would chop him off after cutting the fish.Jiang Xiaomei was also afraid. The water in the pot was boiling, but she didn\u2019t dare talk or move. She continued to add firewood to the stove.Jiang Zhen was very satisfied with the attitude of these two. He stood up and went to Yang Jing\u2019s side, habitually kicking him again. Then he said, \u201cGet up and wash yourself!\u201d Yang Jing had peed in his pants after being scared by him, which made him stink.\u201cYes!\u201d Yang Jing nodded and became afraid again. This guy asked him to clean up. . . For what?Yang Jing usually ate and drank well. Although he was not a big, fat man, he was still very big, but at this moment, he would do anything to make himself look small.He hurriedly went to the kitchen to use hot water. He cleaned himself according to Jiang Zhen\u2019s requirements, and at the same time, the more he washed himself, the more desperate he became.The evil star suddenly let him take a bath. He couldn\u2019t suddenly become so kind-hearted . . . Is it for the sake of skinning?Yang Jing was so scared that when Jiang Zhen gave him Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s clothes after he had washed, he had a sense of happiness that could last him for a lifetime.Holding the clean clothes, Yang Jing was flattered and surprised to be allowed to wear them. Unconsciously, he felt a sense of gratitude.Even though he was not tied up, Yang Jing did not dare to run away. After taking a bath and getting dressed, he even obediently came after Jiang Zhen.\u201cGo and wash your clothes!\u201d Although Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know his thoughts, he didn\u2019t take it very seriously.Yang Jing immediately washed the clothes he had just taken off. He seldom washed his own clothes. At last, after several pots of muddy water, he finished washing and clumsily hung up the clothes.\u201cCome here. I\u2019ll tie you up!\u201d Jiang Zhen said after he saw he had finished cleaning himself up.Yang Jing obediently come over and, without struggle, let Jiang Zhen tie him up.Yang Jing is really very obedient, making Jiang Zhen not hate him too much. He even said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. As long as you are obedient, I won\u2019t kill you.\u201dAs long as I obey, I don\u2019t have to die! Yang Jing looked at Jiang Zhen and felt grateful.Before, Jiang Zhen had not discovered Yang Jing\u2019s feelings of gratitude but now he got a hunch.He was either beating or scolding this man, but he was still looking at him gratefully. What was wrong with him?It seemed that there was such a phenomenon? What was it called . . . Stockholm syndrome?Humans could be tamed, raped, and might even develop feelings for the abuser . . . It seemed that there have been cases in which kidnapped people had helped their kidnappers in turn.Jiang Zhen had only heard about this condition, but now . . . looking at Yang Jing\u2019s clever performance, he suddenly found out that this man seemed to have this syndrome.This man was really mentally ill! But it was still a good thing for him. Instead of hating him, Yang Jing was grateful to him, and it was estimated that he would work harder to cause trouble for Jiang Chengxiang in the future.Jiang Zhen whistled and his mood became particularly good. Of course, he did not relax his vigilance or change his attitude towards Yang Jing because of this.After tying up Yang Jing, Jiang Zhen asked Jiang Xiaomei to light a fire and began to cook the fish by himself.Today, he didn\u2019t have a chance to give Zhao Jinge fish, so he had to cook and eat it by himself . . .\u201cLittle sister, do you remember? In the past when we cooked fish at home, I wasn\u2019t even allowed to have the fish heads to eat,\u201d said Jiang Zhen suddenly. \u201cAt last, when you had finished eating, there was still some fish soup left. I took the mixed rice and wanted to eat it. But second brother unexpectedly took the rice to feed the cat. I could only go hungry . . . Oh, I\u2019m not even as good as a cat in this family.\u201dEldest Jiang really had no place in this family. Even if his brothers and sister couldn\u2019t eat well, they would certainly be able to eat enough. What about him? He often only watched his younger brothers and sister eat and pick up the rice they had dropped on the ground.He lived with no dignity because no one had ever given him any dignity since he was a child.Jiang Xiaomei lowered her head and didn\u2019t dare to speak. She couldn\u2019t remember the specific situation Eldest Jiang just described, but even if there had not been a hundred of them, there were at least 80 similar situations in all these years.Old Madam Jiang hated Eldest Jiang very much. They didn\u2019t like him. In fact, she didn\u2019t like this big brother either.\u201cThat\u2019s my father and mother and I put up with everything, but a few days ago, I already died once, so I decided not to bear it any longer.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled coldly. \u201cFrom now on, I am done with this family.\u201dJiang Xiaomei lowered her head again, but Yang Jing remembered what Jiang Chengxiang said about Eldest Jiang before.According to Jiang Chengxiang, his eldest brother was so stupid, he couldn\u2019t even marry a wife, but according to what he saw today . . . it was clear that the old people of the Jiang family were so biased that they forced Eldest Jiang to be like that.That damned Jiang Chengxiang, after driving his eldest brother crazy, he even pushed him into this firepit! Yang Jing hated Jiang Chengxiang even more. Jiang Zhen was satisfied to have a piece of fish to eat. The words he said were meant for Yang Jing.That night, Jiang Zhen ate half a fish and two bowls of rice and took the extra rice and the rest of the fish back to his room.The house he wanted couldn\u2019t be built well for a while, so he took Yang Jing back to his room and decided to stay with him for a few more days.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t give Yang Jing dinner. At night, he slept on the bed, and Yang Jing was thrown in the corner by him. However, Yang Jing didn\u2019t show the slightest dissatisfaction.If Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t kill him, he would be grateful! Now he hated Jiang Chengxiang for being too slow to save him quickly!If Jiang Chengxiang, who was working late at night, knew Yang Jing\u2019s thoughts, he would feel very aggrieved. He was busy all the time without the slightest delay!Jiang Zhen said that he would not let Yang Jing go until the house was built. People from Hexi Village had been working hard, building the house since that afternoon.To build houses here, they needed to dig up several ditches first, hammer them with stone and mud so as to make a solid foundation, then put two boards, fill mud between the boards, and beat them constantly to make a mud wall.Although the wall was made of mud, it was very solid because of its compactness. It would not be damaged for hundreds of years and would still keep warm in winter and cool in summer.In fact, it took a lot of effort to hit the mud wall, but the whole village was working together, making the speed so fast that the house had already taken shape.Zhao Jinge stared at the several walls and the busy people not too far away from his home for a long time. After making sure that his parents were asleep and no one noticed him, he turned around and disappeared in the night.He was going to find Jiang Zhen to see if he needed his help.Because of today\u2019s events, people in the village said that Jiang Zhen was not easy to mess with. They all thought that Jiang Zhen turned into a madman, but he still thought that Jiang Zhen was not a bad person.If Jiang Zhen was really a bad person, how could he share half of his food with him whenever he got something to eat? He was only pushed too hard by the Jiang family.It was not long before Zhao Jinge came to the vicinity of the Jiang house. He went around the house and finally tapped on the window of Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24.1 - Kissing secretlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 24.1 \u2013 Kissing secretlyJiang Zhen\u2019s experience in the special forces in his previous life had made him develop a particular skill. He could always fall asleep quickly and wake up immediately after there was movement.When he needed to, he could quickly fall in a deep sleep . . . Even if he didn\u2019t sleep for a few days, he would wake up refreshed after a short nap.He used this skill to accomplish many tasks excellently, and now he woke up to the first knock on the window.But Yang Jing, who was thrown in the corner by him, was hungry, cold, and slept uncomfortably. He had no intention of waking up at all at that moment.Getting up from the bed, Jiang Zhen quickly went to the window and opened it.Zhao Jinge, who gently tapped on the window three times, was about to knock again when he saw that the window had just been opened. It was too dark for him to see the face of the man before him, but from the familiar scent, he knew it was Jiang Zhen.\u201cYou . . .\u201d Zhao Jinge wanted to ask Jiang Zhen if there was anything wrong, but before he could ask, Jiang Zhen reached out and covered his mouth.Feeling his mouth covered by Jiang Zhen\u2019s rough hand, Zhao Jinge blushed and forgot what he wanted to ask for a moment.\u201cShhh . . .\u201d Jiang Zhen asked Zhao Jinge to not make a sound and then he touched his face. He propped up the window and quietly went outside.Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house was on the east side of the Jiang main house. When you look from the window facing east, you would see a small mulberry field. On the other side of the mulberry field resided another family. At that moment, the male master of that family was helping build Jiang Zhen\u2019s new house, and the female master had long gone to bed with her child.After Jiang Zhen jumped out of the window, he pulled Zhao Jinge into the mulberry field and walked north.The gate of the Jiang family house faced south, and there was a river not far from their gate. If you walked half a mile north from the gate, you would reach a pond. There was not much to see on this side of Hexi Village except for the water in the river.The pond behind the Jiang family house was neither big nor deep. In it water bamboo and water chestnuts were planted and many trees grew around. Some of the trees had some of their roots stuck in the pond.Jiang Zhen pulled Zhao Jinge by the hand and lead him into a small bush formed by several trees.This was the favorite playground of the children from the village during the daytime, but there was nothing but frogs at night.\u201cI\u2019m glad you came to see me.\u201d Jiang Zhen held Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand and couldn\u2019t help stroking it several times.He didn\u2019t feel that his actions were wrong, but he knew very well that, in the eyes of the villagers, he should not have done something like that to anyone but his partner.The culture of this place was similar to that of ancient China. Many people had this idea that children were the property of their parents. Therefore, even if parents were no longer good to their children, they could only accept it and even had to remain filial.Compared to stories of filial piety, like burying their son in order to serve his mother, Eldest Jiang had a good life. At least, he had been raised, hadn\u2019t he?No matter how much people in the village sympathized with him before, after what happened today, he was afraid that everyone would stay away from him . . . Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t care what others thought of him, but he was a little afraid that Zhao Jinge would hate him.Fortunately, Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t.Jiang Zhen was very happy, but Zhao Jinge was now full of guilt. \u201cI . . . I\u2019m sorry.\u201dHe was worried for his parents, worried that the villagers would drive his family out, that the yamen officer would make trouble for his family. When Jiang Zhen was fighting against the whole village, he only dared to come to see him at night . . . Zhao Jinge felt extremely ashamed.\u201cWhat do you have to feel sorry about?\u201d Hearing Zhao Jinge\u2019s apology, Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t help but laugh. He and Zhao Jinge really have to stay low during this ambiguous period. He just took his small hand. He couldn\u2019t let Zhao Jinge\u2019s family suffer because of him, could he?He was not afraid of being excluded or being taken revenge at, but it was impossible not to care about Zhao Jinge and his parents. And now, he had no ability to protect them at all.Zhao Jinge did not feel relieved at Jiang Zhen\u2019s words but felt even guiltier. The meaning expressed by Jiang Zhen a few days ago was obvious enough. Although he was embarrassed to respond and didn\u2019t say anything to Jiang Zhen, they actually had a tacit understanding. But now that Jiang Zhen was in trouble, he could not advance or retreat with Jiang Zhen.\u201cI\u2019ll talk with my parents. We can move away. . .\u201d Zhao Jinge suddenly came up with a way.However, before he had finished speaking, he was gagged by something. . . But this time, it was not a hand, it was Jiang Zhen\u2019s mouth!Zhao Jinge was stunned. His whole person trembled lightly, and the trembling grew stronger and stronger.Jiang Zhen unexpectedly kissed him. How can Jiang Zhen kiss me!This can only be done after you get married. It\u2019s\u2014Even if you get married, you don\u2019t have to kiss!\u201cAre you okay?\u201d Jiang Zhen patted Zhao Jinge with worry. The kiss he gave him just now could be considered to be very pure. He didn\u2019t even put in his tongue, only their lips were touching. As a result, Zhao Jinge was so stiff, he (JZ) couldn\u2019t even think about using his tongue, and he was also shaking like this . . .Becoming like this after just a little kiss, after entering the bridal chamber, Zhao Jinge would not just faint, would he?At that moment, Zhao Jinge finally regained his mind and also restrained his own subconscious trembling. He was always scared that, after growing old, he would never be close to anyone . . .What\u2019s more, Jiang Zhen agreed to move out?\u201cJinge, you don\u2019t have to move. But for the time being, we can\u2019t let others know that we\u2019re together.\u201d Jiang Zhen patted Zhao Jinge on the shoulder. In ancient times, xenophobia was very serious. Moving to another place could make their situation even worse . . . What\u2019s more, Zhao Jinge\u2019s parents had lived here for most of their lives, and they certainly wouldn\u2019t want to move out.As an adult man, he couldn\u2019t let his wife go wandering around and suffer with him. Of course, if he had a few hundred silver coins, he would take them away immediately.\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhao Jinge, who was kissed a while ago, was still in a trance.\u201cI beat the Jiang family and fought with a yamen officer today. They will definitely retaliate against me. I can stand up to them when I am alone, but I would be afraid If you were with me . . .\u201d Jiang Zhen held Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand and kept petting it. \u201cI would be afraid that you and our parents would not live comfortably.\u201dWhen Jiang Zhen said the first sentence, Zhao Jinge listened carefully and agreed with him. As a result, when Jiang Zhen\u2019s mouth opened again, he said \u201cour parents.\u201dZhao Jinge become confused again.\u201cSo it\u2019s better not to let other people know about our relationship for the time being. But you can rest assured, in a few days, I can make sure no one will dare to bully the people around me,\u201d said Jiang Zhen, but then added that he couldn\u2019t guarantee making a lot of money and doing great things in the future. But gathering several subordinates and becoming a bully in the countryside, who no one will dare to bully, shouldn\u2019t be a problem, he thought.Zhao Jinge was motionless. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know if he had heard even one word he said.When Jiang Zhen saw this situation, he held Zhao Jinge\u2019s face and kissed him on the mouth again. He thought it was necessary for him to kiss Zhao Jinge more to make him get used to it. After all, every time he kissed and touched his wife, his wife stood stiff like wood, didn\u2019t he?Jiang Zhen held Zhao Jinge and said a lot of things before he let Zhao Jinge, who was obviously a little dizzy, go back. When the two separated, he also said, \u201cRest assured, Jinge, I\u2019ll live very close to you in the future. Then we can see each other every day.\u201dThe Jiang\u2019s shabby house was half a mile away from the Zhao family\u2019s house, which was about 250 meters away, making it no problem for him to climb into Zhao Jinge\u2019s window every night.Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t speak. He was dizzy at the moment and was even too confused to understand his own thoughts.Jiang Zhen not only didn\u2019t answer him but also molested him. It should make him angry, but in fact, he wasn\u2019t angry but a little happy.It seems a little shameless of him to think so . . . But he was just so happy.Zhao Jinge walked slowly, and it was not until he got near his home that he sobered up. He and Jiang Zhen. . . In the future, they should hide so that no one could see them together.He didn\u2019t want to do this in his selfish heart, but when he thought of his parents, he knew it was the only way for now.The Jiang family had many members and even more relatives. They couldn\u2019t take Jiang Zhen, and may even not dare to touch him, but his parents . . . In recent years, his father\u2019s health had been getting worse and worse, and his mother\u2019s health had never been good. If something happened to them because of his relationship with Jiang Zhen, he would never be able to forgive himself.Zhao Jinge returned to his room and lay down.He always used to fall asleep immediately, but right then, he stayed up all night.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In fact, apart from Jiang Zhen and Jiang Yuan Wen, who was only two years old, most members of the Jiang family couldn\u2019t fall asleep.Jiang Chengxiang and Butcher Jiang were busy building a house for Jiang Zhen. Jiang Chengwen and Huang Min ware both distressed because of the silver. As for old Madam Jiang, she scolded Jiang Zhen directly at the place where the house was being built.When the sun set down, all the people in the village who helped build the house went home to sleep. However, the Jiang family got together again and discussed for a long time. In the end, they couldn\u2019t figure out what to do.Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house was occupied by Jiang Zhen. He could only go to the village head Jiang Ping\u2019s house for half the night. Just after dawn, he went to the county town together with Jiang Ping.He was going to get money from Zhu Shufen and go to the yamen with Jiang Ping to separate Jiang Zhen\u2019s household registration from the Jiang family\u2019s and transfer the land ownership he had promised to give Jiang Zhen.From then on, Jiang Zhen would have nothing to do with the Jiang family.He wanted Jiang Zhen to obediently continue to work for the Jiang family. What was the result? After a round of trouble, he had not only lost his troops but also lost a battle, allowing Jiang Zhen to take money out of the house.Sitting on the boat and looking at Hecheng County in the morning light, Jiang Chengxiang was extremely bitter in his heart, but even so, when he got to this place, he got off the boat and limped to work.With every step he took, the wound on his leg hurt, but even so, his heart hurt even more.* * *That night, Jiang Zhen slept very well. When he got up in the morning, he ate the leftover fish from last night.Yang Jing, sitting beside Jiang Zhen, watched him eat and could only swallow his saliva.He had a good family background. He hadn\u2019t gone hungry since becoming an adult, but now . . . Yesterday morning, after eating pancakes and fried dough sticks, he hadn\u2019t eaten anything until now. He had been hungry for a long time!Jiang Zhen knew that he must be hungry but still ignored him. Yang Jing was a strong man; it would be better to starve him for several meals to make him weaker.After eating and drinking his fill, Jiang Zhen thought about Zhao Jinge, who he had just kissed twice last night. After thinking about it, Jiang Zhen said to Yang Jing, \u201cIf you don\u2019t try to run away, I won\u2019t tie you up. How about it?\u201d\u201cI will not try to escape!\u201d said Yang Jing.\u201cI dare you to . . . If you dare to run away, I will chop you,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. \u201cI\u2019m a good butcher. It\u2019s easier to cut off human balls, which are on the outside. The balls of pigs are not completely exposed like human ones.\u201dYang Jing trembled, tightened his legs, and even said hurriedly, \u201cDon\u2019t untie me. I think it\u2019s very good to be tied up.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not good. I\u2019m going to take you out. It\u2019s not good to tie you up all the time,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. He then slashed towards Yang Jing with the knife.Yang Jing could only make an \u201cAh!\u201d sound, only to find that he wasn\u2019t hurt at all. The knife only cut the rope around his hands. Yang Jing\u2019s feelings towards Jiang Zhen once again changed a little.\u201cGo!\u201d Jiang Zhen kicked Yang Jing in the leg, not noticing Yang Jing\u2019s change of mood at all. Of course, even if he did, he wouldn\u2019t care.Jiang Zhen took Yang Jing to see the construction of his house, only to find out that the walls of his house were built almost two meters high.This house was built in a square shape, but in the village, there was no specific house type at all. However, the foundation was very solid, making it look very secure.Since it was the ancient times, Jiang Zhen was no longer picky, making him quite satisfied with the house. So he looked at his father standing next to him and said, \u201cWhen the house is built, make all the ingredients and iron pots ready for me. Move here the bed, furniture, and other things from Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house.\u201dThe villagers in Hexi Village basically used iron pots in their homes. The ones with good family conditions would have two large iron pots at home. One was used for cooking the main dish and the other was used for cooking the other dishes. In poorer families, there was only one iron pot at home. It was often necessary to prepare dishes in turn when cooking.The Jiang family has two iron pots, which were also considered one of the most important properties of the Jiang family. Jiang Zhen asked for one directly as well as all of Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house furniture in one breath.\u201cYou . . .\u201d Butcher Jiang was very reluctant, but when he saw Jiang Zhen playing with the knife, he didn\u2019t dare to say anything.Old lady Jiang, who scolded him before, was too afraid to say or do anything upon seeing Jiang Zhen. She could only look at him angrily with a head of chopped hair that could no longer be tied up.\u201cWhat are you staring at? Why don\u2019t you get to work?\u201d Yang Jing was no longer tied up but was still afraid to make any move and followed Jiang Zhen. When he saw the dissatisfied sight of the old lady Jiang, he couldn\u2019t help shouting, looking very fierce.Old lady Jiang didn\u2019t understand why the official invited by her little son would yell at her, but she was currently afraid to fight against her own family and she didn\u2019t dare fight against an outsider, so after being scolded, she didn\u2019t dare to refute him.As for the rest of the villagers . . . they looked at Jiang Zhen in awe. The yamen officer actually listened to him. How fierce was Jiang Zhen?Those who didn\u2019t see Butcher Jiang and Chengxiang being stabbed by Jiang Zhen yesterday became afraid of him. From villager to villager accordingly, Jiang Zhen\u2019s image increasingly became more ferocious.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In the end, he didn\u2019t get to see anyone at all, not even Zhao father or mother.Zhao Fugui went out to work early like Zhao Jinge, as for Zhao Liu, she was too afraid to come out. She closed the house door and never left her house.Touching his nose, Jiang Zhen felt a bit awkward, then he thought, For the villagers, I\u2019m afraid I have already become almost like a monster.It\u2019s reasonable to say that when so many people were gathering to build houses, the women in the village would come to have a chat, and the children would come to play, but in fact, this time . . . Jiang Zhen never saw a child or a woman around when he came here.Even the men who worked here, when he came, all of them worked harder and didn\u2019t dare say even a word.These people worked so hard that he might even be able to move in to his new house tomorrow . . . Thinking of this, Jiang Zhen asked Jiang Quan, the eldest son of the village head, who was arranging for others to do things not far away, \u201cWhen can I live in this house?\u201d\u201cTomorrow. You will be able to live there tomorrow,\u201d asked by Jiang Zhen, Jiang Quan hurriedly replied. Seeing that Jiang Zhen\u2019s face was not good, he quickly changed his words, \u201cWe\u2019ll work harder. You may even be able to start living here tonight.\u201d\u201cWell, just get it ready for me for tomorrow. Where\u2019s your father?\u201d asked Jiang Zhen.\u201cMy father went to the yamen to get your household registration.\u201d Jiang Quan did not dare hide it from Jiang Zhen.\u201cI see. Bring it to me as soon as it\u2019s ready,\u201d Jiang Zhen said and then waved at Jiang Quan, allowing him to leave. He was still penniless and dressed in other people\u2019s clothes, but that attitude . . . it was just like that of the Jiang family members towards him before.Jiang Quan didn\u2019t even think there was anything wrong with it. People in their village were now afraid of Jiang Zhen. After Jiang Quan left Jiang Zhen\u2019s side, there was even a man beating at the mud wall who pulled Jiang Quan to ask, \u201cI want to take a piss, can I go? This way, Jiang Zhen won\u2019t come to hit me, will he?\u201dAfter Jiang Zhen came, they all wanted to run away, but they were afraid that Jiang Zhen would make trouble for them, so in the end, they didn\u2019t dare to run and had to stay and continue working.Fear is contagious. When a group of people get together, they do not become bolder but, instead, more afraid.Under Jiang Zhen\u2019s supervision the house was built very quickly. By lunchtime, several walls had already been put up.When the walls were finished, the next step was to frame the doors and windows, and then put the beams in order to make the roof.At this time, there was another problem.When people in the countryside build houses, they must prepare the wooden beams, doors, and windows as early as possible, but the Jiang family never intended to build a house for Eldest Jiang. The houses for Jiang Chengwen and Jiang Chengxiang had already been built, so naturally, they couldn\u2019t come up with the wood needed for building a house.What about someone else? Although some people in the village had prepared all these things, they had to build their own houses, so they were naturally reluctant to give them to Jiang Zhen.Jiang Quan, who was in charge of building the house, could not get the wood he needed from Butcher Jiang, so he could only look at Jiang Zhen in embarrassment.Jiang Zhen had already moved a chair and sat down. At that time, he sneered. \u201cIf the house is not built, it will not be built. It doesn\u2019t matter if I continue to live in Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house when the people from the yamen come to find me.\u201d Saying that, Jiang Zhen kicked Yang Jing, who was standing beside him, again.Butcher Jiang used to dislike his eldest son because he could not handle his own affairs and didn\u2019t speak. But at that moment, he felt that his then silent son was actually quite good.All the people from the village who came to help looked at Butcher Jiang, and some of them even blamed him. If the yamen officer didn\u2019t return quickly, would the people from the city arrest them all? Butcher Jiang, why don\u2019t you know how to get things done quickly?Butcher Jiang ground his teeth and could only limp around, asking the village people if they had suitable wood. He was willing to pay for several pieces.Worrying about Jiang Zhen, Zhao Jinge went home especially at noon and was just in time to hear Butcher Jiang asking if anyone had wood suitable for making beams at home.Zhao Jinge subconsciously said, \u201cI have . . .\u201d His brother was already sixteen when he died and his family was preparing to build a house for him, so they saved some wood. His father also gathered many stones and piled them behind their house.Later, when his eldest brother had an accident and his family become poor, they also had the idea of selling the wood. However, every family could cut trees and prepare the wood themselves. Because they could not sell the wood for money, they could only keep it at home.In the end, Butcher Jiang bought wood from the Zhao family. Zhao Jinge helped him move it piece by piece. When he came to the place where Jiang Zhen\u2019s house was being built, his eyes drifted to Jiang Zhen.He had been looking at Jiang Zhen, but when his gaze really met Jiang Zhen\u2019s, he immediately rushed to lower his head.Many people in the village were like Zhao Jinge, so no one thought his behavior was strange. A man who had a good relationship with Zhao Jinge said, \u201cJinge, you think Jiang Zhen is terrible too, right? Luckily, I haven\u2019t bullied him before.\u201dZhao Jinge answered vaguely with his head lowered silently. He was not afraid of Jiang Zhen. But after seeing Jiang Zhen, he couldn\u2019t help thinking about what happened last night, making the blood rush to his face.He could not bear to see Jiang Zhen at the moment.As soon as Zhao Jinge finished moving the wood, little sister Jiang came and said timidly, \u201cCan . . . You can eat.\u201d\u201cFood is ready?\u201d Jiang Zhen took a look at Jiang Xiaomei then shouted to the people present, \u201cAll of you, follow me to eat, and eat enough to fill your stomachs. No need to be polite.\u201dWhen he finished speaking, he also glanced around the circle of people. \u201cWho dares not to go . . .\u201d Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t finish this sentence, but the threat in his eyes was clearer than ever.Others only thought that Jiang Zhen wants everyone to eat more of the Jiang family\u2019s food. Only Zhao Jinge, who was about to leave, was moved. Was this Jiang Zhen\u2019s way to have dinner with him?These days, Jiang Zhen has been telling him that he couldn\u2019t go hungry and always brought him food. Although they couldn\u2019t talk right now, Jiang Zhen still remembered to take care of him.Zhao Jinge felt warm in his heart, but the people around him didn\u2019t think much about it. They put down all the different tools in their hands and followed Jiang Zhen to the Jiang family house. Some people didn\u2019t even dare to go to the toilet, afraid that Jiang Zhen would think they were leaving.He was a guy who even dared to beat a yamen officer, and the same official who used to be so powerful now didn\u2019t even dare to make a sound in front of Jiang Zhen.The party soon arrived at the Jiang family house where three tables had been set up, which old lady Jiang borrowed from her neighbors.When someone in the village wanted to build a house, everyone else would help. There was no need to pay for it, but they must make sure that they could eat their fill. . . Chicken, duck, and pork might not be served, but there must be at least two bowls of fish and eggs while the vegetables couldn\u2019t just be boiled but must be stir-fried in oil.However, old lady Jiang only prepared pickled vegetables soup, boiled cauliflowers and vegetables; these vegetarian dishes unexpectedly did not even have tofu.Old lady Jiang was a face-saving person. In the past, even if she was stingy, she did well on such a big event. But today, not only did the family have to give all their money to Jiang Zhen, but they also needed to borrow a lot from other families. How could old lady Jiang be willing to spend money to buy fish and eggs in this situation?Everyone in the village knew about the Jiang family\u2019s situation, so they didn\u2019t say anything. Jiang Zhen sneered, \u201cYou\u2019re going to give me these?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s nothing left at home,\u201d old Madam Jiang said.\u201cThat\u2019s your business. I want to eat meat!\u201d Jiang Zhen said, holding the waist knife belonging to Yang Jing and pointing it directly at him.This knife didn\u2019t even touch Yang Jing, but it still made him stumble.Realizing that if he did not comply with the evil star\u2019s wishes, he would suffer, Yang Jing didn\u2019t hesitate to shout at old lady Jiang, \u201cOld woman, bring meat quickly!\u201dOld lady Jiang was startled by Yang Jing and rushed to cook. She had no place to buy fresh meat at the moment, but there was some bacon at home.Not long after, old lady Jiang brought up a bowl of bacon and scrambled eggs.Sure enough, he had to force the Jiang family . . . The fried eggs with bacon were very fragrant. Jiang Zhen wanted to give Zhao Jinge some of them, but he also knew he couldn\u2019t do it in front of everyone. Not able to give them to Zhao Jinge, he took a big bite.Yang Jing stood beside him swallowing, but Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t speak, so he didn\u2019t dare open his mouth to eat. He just felt that he was going to faint from hunger.Yang Jing, the government official, stood there unable to eat, which made the villagers tremble and feel scared.Noticing this, Jiang Zhen took a bowl of boiled cauliflower to Yang Jing. \u201cYou eat this!\u201dJiang Zhen didn\u2019t give him a proper meal, but Yang Jing was already satisfied with the bowl of boiled cauliflower. He even felt that that bowl of cauliflower, which was short of oil and salt, was the best one he had ever eaten . . . He was really hungry.Jiang Zhen ate two bowls of rice then took the rest of the eggs and fried bacon back to the room. He was ready to take a nap.Before taking a nap, he carefully put the fried eggs into his bamboo tube.Yang Jing saw this scene, but he didn\u2019t know what Jiang Zhen was going to do, and he didn\u2019t dare to ask. He could only shrink in the corner of the room, holding his stomach and remaining silent.A bowl of boiled cauliflower was not enough; he was still hungry now. Fortunately, the house would be built soon . . .After swallowing down his saliva, Yang Jiang suddenly missed his wife.When his wife got married to him, he found she was not beautiful but not ugly either. However, she became fat after giving birth to two children. She always asked people around him to not let him gamble and drink. Gradually, he became more and more annoyed with her and didn\u2019t even want to go home. He didn\u2019t lack food or drink outside, and he had good friends, not to mention how comfortable life was. What was the point of going home?But now, Yang Jing became homesick.Although his wife was fat, she cooked very delicious food. His two children were also very clever and his parents treated him well . . .If it weren\u2019t for Jiang Zhen\u2019s threat to kill his family, he wouldn\u2019t have remembered the good times with his family, and the more he remembered them, the more homesick he became.To tell the truth, his wife was very devoted to him. If she knew that he was suffering here, she would surely find a way to save him. As for his lover, he was not the only lover of the little widow. She may not even remember him.And his two children . . .Yang Jing had never cared about his two children before and knew nothing about their daily lives, but now, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder at Jiang Zhen\u2019s attitude towards his own parents.If his two children were not raised well and became someone like Jiang Zhen, what would he do when he became old?Even if they do not become like Jiang Zhen, but like himself. . . Yang Jing suddenly remembered that, after he became a yamen officer, he had never taken money home.He was suddenly ashamed.Next time he had money, he must take it home and teach his two children well . . . Of course, the most important thing was to let his wife make him a pot of braised pork coupled with delicious white rice to eat two bowls!Yang Jing swallowed again.At this time, Jiang Chengxiang finally returned home from town.Exhausted, he entered the house and dejectedly sat down on a chair.When he and Jiang Ping went to the county town to help Jiang Zhen with his household registration, they didn\u2019t encounter any trouble. Because of the corv\u00e9e and military service, they were all based on the same household registration, so in the yamen, they were eager to help them separate the households. But when he went to his house to get money, he got in a huge fight with his wife.Zhu Shufen refused to give him money and kept crying. He tried talking and begging her for a long time, but she remained unmoved . . . Later, he was really helpless. He cruelly robbed Zhu Shufen\u2019s ten silver coins from the bottom of her box.Zhu Shufen become furious. Before he returned home, she already packed up and went back to her family house.There were a lot of things on his side . . . Jiang Chengxiang had a headache.Forget it. There was no use thinking about it anymore. He\u2019d better settle Jiang Zhen\u2019s problem first and then go get Zhu Shufen back.After taking a nap, Jiang Zhen went to the place where the house was being built and stared at it. By the time he had dinner, his house had almost been built, but it was still empty. The stove had not yet been built, and there was no furniture.Jiang Zhen was still very satisfied with this progress. What\u2019s more, Zhao Jinge, who came back from working in Zhao Dahu\u2019s home, also came to help and wandered in front of him for a long time.Unfortunately, before dinner, Zhao Jinge made an excuse and went home to cut firewood, so he would not go with the others to the Jiang family for a meal.However, he was sure that Zhao Jinge would still come to see him tonight . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He went to him in a few steps and immediately knocked him unconscious, then tied him up again.Before, Yang Jing was able to break free from the rope he had tied, because he had tied it carelessly, deliberately giving him a chance to escape in order to intimidate him. But now . . .Jiang Zhen tied Yang Jing in such a knot, that even if the person who taught Yang Jing how to untie ropes came in person, he would not be able to untie it.After all this, Jiang Zhen got out through the window, planning to wait outside for Zhao Jinge.He had left some fried bacon meat and eggs for Zhao Jinge and was waiting to feed him.As soon as he got out, Jiang Zhen saw a man standing motionless not far away. Who was it if not Zhao Jinge? He didn\u2019t know how long he had been standing outside.This shy man dared to come to find him on his own accord? Jiang Zhen felt amused. He pulled the man towards the pond area again, cradled Zhao Jinge\u2019s face with his hands, and kissed him on the mouth. \u201cI knew you would come to me.\u201dZhao Jinge, with a wooden expression, didn\u2019t speak. At this time, he clearly felt that there was a kind of heat coming from the place Jiang Zhen had just kissed, which eventually spread all over his body, so that he did not want to move.No, there was still a place that wanted to move . . . Feeling that the thing in his crotch was ready to move, Zhao Jinge felt so ashamed that he just wanted to jump into the pond to drown himself.He . . . So that\u2019s it?If his parents knew he was seeing someone in the middle of the night, it would still be like this . . .Zhao Jinge sat motionless beside Jiang Zhen; his thoughts drifted away until he smelled fried bacon.\u201cCome on. Have some scrambled eggs with the meat.\u201d Jiang Zhen put a chopstick of eggs into Zhao Jinge\u2019s mouth and then gave him another mouthful of rice.Zhao Jinge slowly ate it and put his heart at ease.Jiang Zhen should be with him wholeheartedly. In that case, it was okay for the two of them to be close to each other. They would eventually get married in the future.The next day, under Jiang Zhen\u2019s command, all the furniture in Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house was moved to his new house along with a large iron pot and pots and pans from the Jiang family.With just a little tidying up to do, the new house was ready to be moved in . . .Jiang Zhen guided Yang Jing to look around his house with the knife and then took the villagers who had helped with the building of the house back to the Jiang family\u2019s home for lunch.After lunch, Jiang Zhen stretched out his hand to Jiang Chengxiang and said, \u201cThe silver and the document, are they ready?\u201d\u201cThis is the household registration document, the silver . . .\u201d Jiang Chengxiang looked at old Madam Jiang, who kept the money.\u201cHere.\u201d Old lady Jiang took out a bag of silver.Jiang Zhen weighed the money bag in his hand and said to Jiang Chengwen, \u201cBring me a scale and weigh it!\u201dJiang Chengwen, who had been standing far away, did not expect to be chosen by Jiang Zhen. He felt he was unlucky but did not dare to disobey. He quickly brought back a scale.Many people in the countryside had scales at home, but scales were made from stone, so there was some deviation when weighing things.The scale in the Jiang family house, when weighing things, would show a weight a little heavier than the actual weight. As a result, the bag of silver that should weigh no less than forty, weighed only thirty-nine.Jiang Zhen looked calmly at old Madam Jiang.\u201cThere\u2019s only 38 silver in the family, there is not even a penny left.\u201d Old lady Jiang shivered. After seeing Jiang Zhen\u2019s sudden violent behavior, the calmer his expression was, the more frightened she became. She regretted her lack of money. She didn\u2019t want to give him forty silver, so in the end, she only gave him a little more than thirty-seven silver, which wasn\u2019t obvious. Who would have thought that Jiang Zhen would want to weigh it?\u201cNo more silver at home?\u201d Jiang Zhen still had that pleasant-looking expression.\u201cNo, there\u2019s no more silver at home.\u201d Old Madam Jiang could only maintain her stance.\u201cWell then, I won\u2019t force you to lend more money,\u201d Jiang Zhen said with a smile.When old lady Jiang heard Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, her face immediately brightened. Is this evil star really not going to investigate? It was an unexpected surprise to her that she could save three silver.Jiang Zhen put the bag of silver into the sack he had already prepared a long time ago and suddenly walked towards the house.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d old Madam Jiang asked, surprised.Jiang Zhen had already answered old Madam Jiang\u2019s question with actions. After he rushed in, he grabbed a pig and dragged it out by its ears.The pig squealed in bursts; its four hooves were fixed on the ground. It refused to move, but in the end, it could not withstand Jiang Zhen\u2019s strength and was dragged out by him.The Jiang family raised three pigs, and Jiang Zhen had coveted them for a long time.He didn\u2019t think about killing these three pigs before because he felt that he wasn\u2019t the eldest brother Jiang who had been beaten by the Jiang family. It was not easy for him to take this and that from the Jiang family. But now . . . he can finally kill a pig and eat pork!\u201cWhat are you trying to do? Stop it!\u201d Seeing Jiang Zhen dragging a pig, old lady Jiang shouted in panic.\u201cLittle sister, go get a bucket for the pig blood!\u201d Jiang Zhen said to Xiaomei Jiang and ignored old lady Jiang. Originally, he certainly didn\u2019t care about a little bit of pig blood, but recently, he hadn\u2019t had any meat to eat, which made him reluctant to waste even pig blood.Jiang Xiaomei stood still and didn\u2019t dare to move. At last, Butcher Jiang kicked her and said, \u201cGo get the bucket!\u201d\u201cBoil some water by the way!\u201d Jiang Zhen ordered again, then he pressed the pig to the ground, stepped on it with his feet, and said to the villagers around him, \u201cI want to kill a pig and sell pork. You\u2019d better not go away. . . Of course, you can go home to get money.\u201dJiang Zhen spoke in a calm voice, but his momentum and the struggling pig under his feet made him look particularly ferocious.People who originally wanted to go back didn\u2019t dare to go right then. Of course, some people went home to get money.Jiang Zhen smiled and said to Jiang Chengxiang, \u201cGo and fetch a bench!\u201dThe ancient pig had no fodder, and it was often fed grass, so it was light. The Jiang family\u2019s pig was already fattened, but it only weighed about a hundred kilos. He estimated that he could get 70\u201380 kilos of pork after clean up.Such a small pig, Jiang Zhen could naturally press it down to death. But even if he could do it, the rest of the villagers couldn\u2019t. Seeing the pig under his feet struggling and screaming but still unable to escape, they all unconsciously took a step back.After Jiang Chengxiang moved several stools together, Jiang Zhen picked up the pig and pressed it against the stool. By that time, Jiang Xiaomei, who had seen Butcher Jiang kill a pig before, had placed the bucket under the pig\u2019s neck in order to collect its blood.Jiang Zhen stabbed the knife into the pig\u2019s neck. As soon as the handle of the knife turned and cut the pig\u2019s throat, the pig suddenly lost its breath, twitching. Blood gushed out of its throat.When he did this, he deliberately let go of his forceful aura and smiled deliberately. This smile was learned from a perverted killer; it was full of satisfaction and enjoyment. There was nothing to look at, but it was creepy to smile with a butcher knife in hand.The people around were really scared. Butcher Jiang used to kill pigs in the same manner. Everyone saw that he had never been afraid of killing pigs, but for some reason, when Jiang Zhen killed the pig just now, he made their hairs stand on end and terrified them.Jiang Zhen was in a good mood at that moment. When the pig\u2019s blood flowed out, he threw the pig on the ground and suddenly thought that if he had nothing to do, for the time being, he could actually kill pigs . . .Eldest Jiang had the skill for killing pigs, which he inherited from his memories. I think that killing pigs is very simple. He had even killed people before, so it was not like he was unable to kill pigs.Next was . . . to soak the pig in hot water for a while in order to scrape off the pig\u2019s hair. When the pig\u2019s hair was scraped clean, he needed to open its stomach in order to take out the intestines and then deal with its internal organs.There was no technical content in those things. Jiang Zhen skillfully scraped off the pig\u2019s hair with a piece of clamshell and then turned his attention to the intestines in the pig\u2019s stomach.He was too lazy to wash the pig\u2019s intestines, so he only cut off the heart, lungs, liver and stomach, then took out the machete to cut the pig, and divided it into two parts.When killing pigs, Jiang Zhen was actually on guard, for fear that someone would attack him at the first opportunity, but at the moment, it was obvious that he was thinking too much . . .They did not dare fight him at all, so he butchered the pig in peace.The whole pig had been divided into two parts. Jiang Zhen divided each half into three pieces: front legs, torso, and back legs.What he did was what Butcher Jiang had done for many years, but his blade was unswerving as it cut and his face was still smiling, which made people tremble.Although Yang Jiang was released by Jiang Zhen, he didn\u2019t dare to run away and stayed in place. Every time Jiang Zhen slashed with the knife, his head could not help but duck. For a moment, he was extremely glad that he had not provoked Jiang Zhen. At least, he was able to leave the Jiang family house in one piece.\u201cTwenty copper pennies for a kilo of pork. Do you want it?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at the villagers he had ignored.Jiang Zhen looked like he would cut them if they didn\u2019t buy, but everyone was afraid to be the first one to buy.In the end, Jiang Ping, the village head, clenched his teeth and walked forward in the spirit of self-sacrifice. \u201cI\u2019ll buy five kilos.\u201d\u201cOkay.\u201d Jiang Zhen cut off the front leg of the pig and removed the big bones from the meat. Then he went with a knife, and after estimating he had cut 5 kilos of meat, he weighed it. \u201cFour and a half kilos. Ninety copper pennies!\u201dThere was a butcher in the county town who sold pork every day. He would sell it more expensively on New Year\u2019s day, but usually, he would sell it a little cheaper.It\u2019s a normal day. When Jiang Zhen started selling pork at 20 copper pennies per kilo, the village people felt that it was expensive, especially as they were being forced to buy, making them even more reluctant.As a result, when Jiang Zhen sold the pork, he even removed the bones from the meat. That is to say, what he sold was pure pork meat!After Jiang Ping, others came forward to buy meat one after another, and the reluctance in their hearts disappeared without a trace.Butcher Jiang looked at this scene with a black face. The pig was so big that he wanted to buy better silkworm eggs from the profits he would have gotten from it. But the result was . . .Jiang Zhen soon sold most of the pork. Because he didn\u2019t open his mouth to say he would allow the people around him to leave, those who bought the pork didn\u2019t dare to leave.\u201cI\u2019m not selling it.\u201d All of a sudden, Jiang Zhen said this. There remained only about ten kilos of meat, bones, and internal organs. He didn\u2019t want to sell it but put them all in a big wooden bucket, waiting to take it home to eat.Of course, he didn\u2019t want the intestines.Hexi villagers always eat the pig intestines. With the lack of food and clothing in ancient times, no one was willing to throw away the oily pig intestines, but this thing was very troublesome to clean, so Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t want it.After packing up what he wanted, Jiang Zhen looked at the butcher and said, \u201cThis pig didn\u2019t get me two silver, so I also want the egg-laying chicken at home and other food. Please send it to me as soon as possible.\u201dIn addition to the forty silver, Jiang Zhen had asked for five sacks of grain.Five sacks were six hundred kilos. These days, people rarely have the opportunity to eat fats and protein, and they had to do physical work. They ate a lot of food; it was absolutely no problem for an adult to eat two or three kilos of grain a day, but with 600 kilos of food, Jiang Zhen wouldn\u2019t have to worry about starving for a long time.\u201cIt\u2019s spring. Where will you get the five sacks of grain from home?\u201d Butcher Jiang was so busy gathering money that he forgot about it.If there had been no special circumstances, country people were not willing to sell the newly beaten grain after paying the full tax, but they would sell the last year\u2019s grain when there was a surplus and the family had enough food.The Jiang family had a lot of land, so every year, after the grain in the field had been collected, the harvested grain from the previous year would be sold. So Jiang Zhen knew very well that the Jiang family would certainly be able to come up with five sacks of grain.But at the moment, he was too lazy to talk to Butcher Jiang . . .With a big knife for cutting meat, he went directly to the granary, which was built behind the house. After a few slashes with the knife, Jiang Zhen directly opened the granary. \u201cAre you sure there is no grain I want in there?\u201dAfter doing this, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t have much to say. He went to his new home with a bucket of pork. By the way, he took away all the knives that Butcher Jiang used to kill pigs and cut meat.The heavy bone machete was not cheap. The butcher and old lady Jiang were bound to be distressed again.But no matter how distressed they were, they didn\u2019t dare to ask for the knives back. They even sent to him five sacks of grain and the chicken that can lay eggs that same day.Having learned from the past lessons, this time, they didn\u2019t dare to be short on the weight for fear of Jiang Zhen going back and robbing them of the remaining two piglets.Jiang Zhen was very satisfied with this and did not look for trouble after collecting the things he demanded. After several days of struggling, he didn\u2019t want to continue struggling.Finally, he was separated from this family. Now he could live his own life . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Thinking of this, Jiang Zhen was somewhat disappointed. He had gotten Eldest Jiang\u2019s body and memory and was able to live in the ancient times, but Eldest Jiang . . . The man who never had a good life was dead.Jiang Zhen sympathized with Eldest Jiang, but he only did so for a short time. He still had a lot of work to do.Building houses in the countryside didn\u2019t need bricks or tiles. They all had earthen walls with beams within them, and then bamboo and thatch were used to make the roof. It could be built very quickly. Jiang Zhen\u2019s house was built even faster with the help of the whole village. Although it was built, it was still not suitable for living.There were no blue bricks or slate on the ground. An all mud house was already very wet and the newly built mud wall had increased the moisture and humidity by a level. The house was still missing a lot of things.Jiang Zhen first prepared a room to store food. Then he shut the chicken he got from the Jiang family in a broken-down thatched hut that had not been torn down, threw a handful of corn at it, and began to unpack his own house.Probably in order to build the house for him as soon as possible, the villagers did not add a chimney in the house since it needed a certain amount of skill to build, and the mud stove built for him to cook was very crude. It looked like a circle that can set up a pot, but at least it worked because it\u2019s short and he didn\u2019t have to worry about burning the hut with it.From the thatched cottage, he brought back some straw and mulberry sticks and put them into the mud stove to light it, dispelling the moisture in the house and drying the mud stove at the same time. Jiang Zhen thought about it and lit fires all over the house.All the doors and windows were open. After the small fires were ignited, the moisture on the surface of the house almost dissipated, and as for the moisture in the mud wall, it did not matter at the moment.In fact, the furniture moved from Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s house was not much. Jiang Zhen sorted it out before putting it in the house. Then he found out that he still lacked a lot of things.There are tables and chairs in every household. He doesn\u2019t have any right now and still lacks a lot of daily necessities. . . Looks like he will need to go to the county town tomorrow.After cleaning up the house, Jiang Zhen went to rebuild the hut behind the house.The old hut had a special room, but the toilet in the new house . . . The villagers had just casually dug a hole!Jiang Zhen was a little intolerant of such a simple solution, so he planned to change it, or at least he had to dig a passage on the floor leading to the outside and a cesspool, so that his own toilet in the house would not smell.Jiang Zhen, who took a nap every day in the past few days, skipped it for the first time. He was in a good mood while digging a pit and humming a song. However, while he was in a good mood, the Jiang family were in a bad mood.With so much silver and grain taken away at once, even if the Jiang family was still rich, it would probably take at least two years to recover.\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t that bastard just die by a thousand knife cuts?\u201d old lady Jiang scolded Jiang Zhen as she rubbed the pig\u2019s large intestines with salt.After Jiang Zhen killed the pig, he didn\u2019t leave them even a piece of meat. All he left was a mess, a pile of pig intestines and half a bucket of pig blood. These were good things. Naturally, old lady Jiang was reluctant to throw them away, so she cursed others as she dealt with them.Jiang Xiaomei listened silently to old Madam Jiang scolding Jiang Zhen.Before, she was very afraid of Jiang Zhen, but now that Jiang Zhen left, looking back, she only found out that Jiang Zhen hadn\u2019t done anything to her except snatching her eggs. Her fear dissipated a lot. At that moment, when she heard old lady Jiang swearing, she could not help but sympathize with her eldest brother.Her second brother and third brother were married, and each of them spent dozens of silver as betrothal gifts and to make furniture for the wedding ceremonies. For their own wedding banquets, they used several sacks of grain to make wedding cakes. In fact, her eldest brother did not take much.However, it didn\u2019t make any sense to think about it now. She might as well think about how to find a good, rich husband . . . A few days ago, she was told by her mother that she wanted to find her a mother-in-law, who was willing to pay a higher bride price, so she could use the bride price to pay off her debts.Little sister Jiang didn\u2019t have any ideas about using her own bride price to repay the debts of her family. The girls in the village got married, and their bride price was basically for their parents. Parents already loved their daughter if they would give a couple of silver to prepare some quilts and furniture at the bottom of the box. She now wanted to choose a good one among those who were willing to pay the higher bride price so that she would not have to live a hard life in the future.When Jiang Xiaomei was worrying about her marriage, Jiang Chengxiang sent Yang Jing, who had been invited to his home a few days ago, to the county town.Along the way, Jiang Chengxiang kept apologizing to Yang Jiang, but Yang Jiang kept ignoring him. After arriving it the county town, Yang Jiang even drew out the knife on his waist pointing it to Jiang Chengxiang. \u201cYou get out of here!\u201dJiang Chengxiang was just a thin scholar; when threatened with a knife like this, he suddenly stumbled, not daring to follow Yang Jing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were so similar to the actions of the Jiang family\u2019s evil star when beating him?Thinking of the jinx of the Jiang family, Yang Jing suddenly felt pain all over his body. Although the evil star didn\u2019t hit him too hard these days, he still took a kick from time to time, leaving him bruised all over, so he didn\u2019t have a piece of healthy skin left.He was tired and hungry . . . Today at noon that evil star allowed him to eat, but only let him eat a small bite!Yang Jing quickly walked home, ready to eat and sleep before thinking about anything else.The Yang family had a small yard in the county town. As Yang Jiang entered the yard, he saw his wife feeding the chicken.There were a lot of clothes in the yard that he was familiar with, and all the things around him were neatly arranged. His elder son was not here, but the younger one, a four-year-old, was playing with a few pieces of wood in the corner.\u201cYang Jing, where have you been? How come you didn\u2019t come home or go to the yamen in these two days?\u201d When Yang Jing\u2019s wife saw him, she let go of the dustpan with millet in her hand and came over, asking, \u201cDid you gamble again? How much did you lose?\u201dYang Jing usually became most impatient when this woman unceasingly chattered at him, but those past days he had been suffering, and hearing such concern now warmed his heart.\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Yang Jing said. \u201cYou go and get me something to eat! Hurry up!\u201d\u201cAlright.\u201d Yang Jing\u2019s wife immediately went to the kitchen to cook.\u201cWait a minute!\u201d Yang Jing stopped her. \u201cStir-fry me a bowl of eggs with bacon!\u201d God knows how greedy that evil star was when he ate this dish those days. . .Fresh meat still needed to be bought, but bacon was still available in the family\u2019s home. Yang Jing\u2019s wife soon cut bacon into small pieces and stir-fried two eggs. She also served Yang Jing the leftover rice from lunch.With a bowl in his hand, Yang Jing began to eat it up. Only after a few mouthfuls of rice, he felt that his whole person had come back to life.\u201cSlow down, don\u2019t eat too fast, be careful of choking, or should I get you another soup?\u201d asked Yang Jing\u2019s wife.\u201cNo,\u201d Yang Jing said. He would already have finished eating by the time the soup was ready.Just thinking about this, Yang Jing suddenly saw his little son standing not far away, looking at the fried eggs on the table, drooling.He was a yamen officer. He earned two silver from the yamen each month, and from time to time, he would also receive filial piety from his underlings. He would share some extra money with his colleagues, and he usually had an income of more than 10 silver each month. According to this, his son should eat meat every day, but in fact . . .He took the silver to gamble, bought things for his lovers, and ate and drank spicy food by himself. In fact, he never brought money home.The children of his colleagues could go to school, but his eldest son who was already seven years old was still playing, covered in mud in the alley.\u201cWhat are you looking at? Go outside and play!\u201d Yang Jing\u2019s wife saw her little son staring at Yang Jing\u2019s scrambled eggs. Fearing that Yang Jiang would get angry, she slapped the child.\u201cWhat are you doing hitting the kid?\u201d Yang Jiang trembled when he saw his wife yelling at his second son. He had already understood what had happened to the Jiang family, and it was all caused by old lady Jiang\u2019s harsh treatment of her own son. He decided to not fall into that situation himself!\u201cCome, Ermao! Come to Dad! Dad will give you eggs.\u201d Yang Jing smiled at his youngest son.Yang Ermao, who hadn\u2019t gotten a proper name, lowered his head and looked at Yang Jing a little fearfully, which made Yang Jing feel a little bad.Yang Jing ate half of the bowl of bacon with scrambled eggs. He asked his wife to share the rest with his two children. After that, he took two silver from his pocket and gave it to his wife.He had brought the two silver with him before he went to the Jiang family house. Jiang Zhen beat him all the time, but he never stole his money.After Yang Jing gave her the silver, he went back to his room to sleep. After a while the smell from the kitchen woke him up.That\u2019s the smell of braised pork! Regardless of his sore body, Yang Jiang quickly got up from the bed and went to the kitchen, drooling.His wife had bought a pork rib and made a bowl of braised pork. The meat was oily and looked delicious.Yang Jing is the only son; his parents spoiled him from an early age, which made him develop a reckless temperament. Usually, when such a bowl of meat is put on the table, he would eat half a bowl alone, but now . . .After giving a piece of meat to his two children, his parents, and his wife, Yang Jiang suddenly found out that there was only one piece left in the bowl . . . If he ate a few pieces like usual, someone would be left with nothing to eat.\u201cI don\u2019t like meat . . .\u201d Yang Jing\u2019s wife gave Yang Jing her piece of meat from her bowl.\u201cNo, you eat it yourself!\u201d Yang Jing refused his wife\u2019s offer and stirred the stewed pork soup in his bowl. He ate two big bowls of rice with that one piece of meat. After eating, he was relieved to see that his two children looked a little closer to him when he met their eyes.Yang Jing was served at home, but Jiang Zhen was alone at the moment.In the afternoon, when he was cooking on the stove, he cooked the pig bones and made a big pot of bone soup. As a result, when he wanted to throw some vegetables in the bone soup and cook them, and then cook a pot of rice, he suddenly found out that . . . he had no rice to cook.The Jiang family gave him five sacks of rice grains, but it was all rice with shells, not peeled rice!So if he wanted to eat rice, he had to pound it first . . . However, he didn\u2019t have any tools to pound the rice with.Forget it. Even if there were no tools, there were still other ways to deshell some rice . . .Jiang Zhen put the rice into the bamboo tube and kept pounding it with a stick. He finally made himself a bowl of rice with a few deshelled rice grains inside.He scooped half of the pig bone soup in the pot with a gourd ladle. Jiang Zhen poured the bowl of rice that he managed to deshell into the bone soup left in the pot, then cut the pig liver into small pieces, and threw it into the pot.As for the rest of the meat, as well as the pig stomach, Jiang Zhen thought it would be better to eat it slowly, so he took out a can of salt brought from the Jiang family and salted it up. By the time he had salted the meat, he had almost run out of salt.It seems that I need to go to the county town tomorrow, Jiang Zhen thought and began to put firewood in the mud stove to cook the pig liver porridge.He needed protein and fats at the moment, but vegetables couldn\u2019t be excluded . . . Seeing that the porridge was almost cooked, Jiang Zhen went out and stole a single lettuce from Zhao Jinge\u2019s field . . .There was really no other way. Who told the Jiang family not to grow vegetables in this field for him, and other people\u2019s homes were too far away?However, the vegetables in the countryside were of little worth. It was actually nothing for him to take a few vegetables from others. Moreover, he planned to give Zhao Jinge half of the porridge.Jiang Zhen chopped the stems and leaves of the lettuce and put them into the pot. When the porridge was ready, he finally had dinner.After eating the pig liver porridge, Jiang Zhen chewed the bones open.Looking at Eldest Jiang\u2019s memory, he learned that when people killed pigs or bought meat and had pig bones left behind, they would not only cook soup with the pig bones but also chop them into small pieces and cook them for a long time. Then . . . apart from the middle part of the bone that couldn\u2019t be chewed and eaten, some bones that could be boiled soft could be chewed and eaten directly.When others ate like this, he didn\u2019t want to waste it. After all, his body was a little short of calcium.It\u2019s said that bone soup couldn\u2019t actually supplement calcium. Would it supplement calcium, if he chewed the bones directly?It was already dark when Jiang Zhen had enough to eat and drink. He lit a fire in his house, and while warming himself, he began pounding rice in the light of the fire, waiting for the night.When night falls, Zhao Jinge will definitely come to find him!Jiang Zhen happily pounded the rice for nearly two hours. Even with a bamboo tube, he deshelled enough rice to eat for several days. However, he still couldn\u2019t wait to see Zhao Jinge.Zhao Jinge is not coming today? Jiang Zhen frowned and threw away the bamboo tube in his hand. He decided to climb the wall.At ten o\u2019clock at night, it was completely dark and all the villagers were asleep. Jiang Zhen came to the Zhao family\u2019s house and knocked on Zhao Jinge\u2019s window.After a while, the window opened. It was obvious that Zhao Jinge hadn\u2019n been asleep either. Too shy to come to see me, but still waiting for me?\u201cJinge, come out!\u201d said Jiang Zhen.\u201cI\u2019m going to sleep . . .\u201d said Zhao Jinge.\u201cIf you don\u2019t come out, I\u2019ll go in.\u201d Jiang Zhen pretended to climb into the house.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When the fire became stronger, he also took a few pieces of mulberry strips and put them in the mud stove, intending to heat up the porridge in the pot.While Jiang Zhen was working beside him Zhao Jinge looked at him and felt guilty again. After Jiang Zhen started to live alone, he not only couldn\u2019t help him but also let Jiang Zhen cook for him . . .Zhao Jinge wanted to get up to help, but Jiang Zhen had finished all the work by himself.\u201cHere, have a bowl of porridge.\u201d Jiang Zhen handed Zhao Jinge some porridge with pig liver and bone soup.Zhao Jinge looked at it and found out that there were a lot of pig liver pieces in this porridge. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to keep feeding me . . .\u201d\u201cI like to give it to you,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. It had been two hours since he had dinner and he was hungry again, so he filled two small bowls and ate together with Zhao Jinge, looking at Zhao Jinge from time to time.The room was quiet. There was only the sound of the two of them drinking porridge that could be heard, but Jiang Zhen felt very happy.He has been living on his own since he retired from the army, and now he finally had company.Zhao Jinge, seeing Jiang Zhen looking at him, felt uncomfortable and couldn\u2019t tell the taste of the porridge in his hand.\u201cI brought you something,\u201d Zhao Jinge said when Jiang Zhen looked over again, breaking the atmosphere in the room that didn\u2019t seem quite right in his eyes.\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Jiang Zhen.Zhao Jinge took out several small bamboo tubes from his arms and gave them to Jiang Zhen. He pointed to one of them and said, \u201cHere is green rapeseed. Now is not the time to plant it, but if you sow it, it can sprout and then you can eat it.\u201dAfter that, he pointed to the remaining bamboo tubes and explained them one by one; they were full of vegetable seeds.\u201cWhy did you suddenly think of sending this to me?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cThis . . .\u201d Zhao Jinge hesitated but didn\u2019t speak. In fact, his mother saw Jiang Zhen stealing their lettuce, so he remembered that Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t have any vegetables to eat now.They could eat a lot of food here, and there was no shortage of vegetables all year round. However, people prefered to grow long-lasting food. They usually planted seeds in the front and in the back of their houses to grow vegetables, which was enough for their own families to eat.However, even if other people were not short of vegetables to eat, Jiang Zhen was different. He had no seeds to plant, so he had no vegetables to eat.\u201cPlant these seeds first, and soon, there will be vegetables to eat. As for these days . . . I\u2019ll bring you some food every day, \u201cZhao Jinge said again.\u201cDid your mother see me stealing the lettuce?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at Zhao Jinge and laughed.\u201cIt\u2019s not stealing, if you eat a lettuce,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. In fact, no one would say anything when the neighbors took some vegetables to eat. After all, it didn\u2019t cost money to grow them in their own land. But Jiang Zhen recently took on the title of jinx and startled his mother, when he went to pluck out a lettuce.He didn\u2019t care that Jiang Zhen went to his home to get some vegetables, but it\u2019s not good for him to let his mother have a problem with Jiang Zhen.\u201cOK. I\u2019ll wait for you to bring me some food in the future,\u201d Jiang Zhen said with a smile, holding Zhao Jinge and kissing him on the cheek again.He has been kissed before. This time he was only kissed on his cheek, so it didn\u2019t scare Zhao Jinge. But even so, Zhao Jinge felt very uncomfortable, unconsciously clenching hard the bowl in his hand.Jiang Zhen also let go of him. \u201cDrink the porridge. Eating pig liver is good for your health.\u201dJiang Zhen took out all the porridge left in the pot and shared it with Zhao Jinge. Then he sent Zhao Jinge back to the Zhao family\u2019s house. When Zhao Jinge climbed into his room through the window and said goodbye to him, Jiang Zhen held his head and kissed him on the mouth.Jiang Zhen stayed up a little late that night, so he got up late the next day.He cooked a pot of rice with the rice he had shelled hard last night and steamed a small piece of bacon and a piece of pig liver he had left on the steaming rack all night.Ancient pigs didn\u2019t eat feed. They were natural and pollution-free, but in fact, they didn\u2019t taste better than those pigs of later generations.If you think about it, these days, pigs can only eat some grass and don\u2019t gain weight easily.I think it\u2019s also true that pigs in these years usually only eat some pig grass and don\u2019t grow fat.If you wanted to raise a pig, you couldn\u2019t raise it for more than ten months. The pigs raised this way . . . the lean meat was a bit old, the fat was too little, and the skin was too thick.Its fragrance was rich, but this kind of meat was better for a man like him, who was short of oil and water.Of course, it might also be that pig breeding was not good enough. Nowadays, one didn\u2019t have a place to buy a good pig. He had seen the chicken and ducks raised by the villagers before, which were generally smaller than what he had seen in his first live.However, even if the meat didn\u2019t taste perfect, it was still meat! Jiang Zhen ate two bowls of rice with pork in one breath, then filled a bamboo tube with rice and a piece of pork the size of two fingers, wanting to deliver it to Zhao Jinge on the way to the county town later.Thinking about going to the county town, Jiang Zhen especially changed his clothes and combed his hair with his fingers, only then did he pack some silver. Before going out, he also went to check his chicken. Perhaps because of the change of place, the chicken was a little scared and didn\u2019t lay any eggs, which made him feel very pitiful.Jiang Zhen went to find Zhao Jinge, but he didn\u2019t talk to him. He just looked at him and put the bamboo tube in the grass nearby, so that Zhao Jinge could easily find it and eat it.For the time being, he and Zhao Jinge might have to \u201ccheat\u201d and behave like they were not close to each other.Eldest Jiang seldom went to the county town, but he still knew the way. After all, there was only one way to the county town from the village.Hexi Village was not far from the county town. Jiang Zhen walked to the town in less than half an hour. Then he saw the county town that Eldest Jiang thought was very prosperous.To be honest, Jiang Zhen was disappointed when he saw the county town. He used to travel to those small waterside towns, so he always thought that Hecheng county town should be as prosperous and beautiful as those small waterside towns, but in fact . . .From time to time, people would paint and rebuild tourist attractions, but reality was completely different.The roads in Hecheng county were very narrow. Except for the main road in the middle of the town that was relatively wide, the other roads were very narrow. The houses on the street also looked very dilapidated . . . Of course, the most important thing was that there was no busy shopping street with shops on both sides.Although there were shops on this street, they were really a little shabby in Jiang Zhen\u2019s view.Of course, it\u2019s not a good idea to look at this era with the eyes of future generations. Jiang Zhen soon adjusted his state of mind and walked towards the dock not far away.It was said that Hecheng county town was the richest among several nearby county towns because there was a dock here, and the most prosperous places in town were near the dock.After arriving here, Jiang Zhen finally saw the ancient city he imagined. At the same time, he also saw his two acquaintances, Yang Jing and Jiang Chengxiang.When Jiang Zhen saw them, these two men also saw Jiang Zhen.After a night\u2019s rest, Yang Jing reported to the yamen today and went on patrol.Now he was so afraid of Jiang Zhen, he didn\u2019t dare to make trouble for him at all. The crimes he suffered in those few days were all blamed on Jiang Chengxiang. Not only that, after he came out on patrol, he came to make trouble for Jiang Chengxiang.As a result, before he could teach Jiang Chengxiang a lesson, he looked up and saw Jiang Zhen standing not far away.Yang Jing\u2019s movements became subconsciously stiff and he had the impulse to turn around and run. But Jiang Zhen had already seen him. If he ran away . . . Yang Jing took a deep breath, and his arrogance disappeared without a trace.Walking towards Jiang Zhen, Yang Jing, dressed in a yamen officer\u2019s uniform, subconsciously revealed the expression he usually used when he saw his immediate superior. With a flattering look on his face he said, \u201cEldest Jiang? What are you doing in the county town?\u201dJiang Zhen glanced up and down Yang Jing. \u201cI\u2019ll be doing some shopping. Besides, don\u2019t call me Eldest Jiang. Why don\u2019t you . . . just call me boss.\u201dIn the past, Jiang Chengxiang and Jiang Chengwen didn\u2019t call him eldest brother but followed Butcher Jiang in calling him Eldest Jiang. He was not happy to hear that, because they didn\u2019t respect him at all when they called him this way, but now, he made Yang Jing call him boss with a different meaning, and Yang Jiang did not dare to be disrespectful to him.Jiang Zhen\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.Yang Jiang was very good, not only did he change his address, but he also became very enthusiastic. \u201cWhat do you want to buy, boss? I\u2019ll go with you. The price will be cheaper.\u201d In fact, he didn\u2019t know what \u201cboss\u201d really meant, but he didn\u2019t dare to offend Jiang Zhen, so he did what Jiang Zhen said.\u201cAlright.\u201d Jiang Zhen nodded in agreement.Yang Jing was relieved to find that this man had no ill feelings towards him and had no intention of beating him up again. Yang Jiang breathed a sigh of relief and then left the dock with Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen wanted to buy a lot of things, and the first store he went to was the place where seasoning was sold.\u201cGive me five kilos of salt . . . How much is the salt?\u201d When Jiang Zhen was about to buy salt, he suddenly remembered that the price of salt did not seem to be cheap.Old lady Jiang didn\u2019t allow Eldest Jiang to touch money, so there was no specific price in his memory, but even so, from her words, he could see that the salt price was not cheap.\u201cForty copper pennies a kilo,\u201d the shopkeeper said.Forty? The price of salt is twice that of pork? Jiang Zhen was a little surprised and immediately changed his order. \u201cJust give me two kilos of salt.\u201dThe shopkeeper had already begun to take out salt. When he heard Jiang Zhen change his mind, he could not help frowning, but when he looked up and saw Yang Jiang standing next to Jiang Zhen, he immediately smiled and became more enthusiastic about Jiang Zhen.It was easy even for children to see a death flag. People who do business in this county town were not willing to offend a yamen officer.\u201cShopkeeper Zhang, we are all acquaintances. Make it cheaper!\u201d Yang Jing said carelessly, and then Jiang Zhen\u2019s two kilo of salt only costed 70 copper pennies.After buying salt, Jiang Zhen wanted to buy vinegar and soy sauce. As it turned out, the vinegar and soy sauce in this shop were all in jars. When the clients came to buy them, they scooped out some of it and put it in their own containers. But Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t bring any containers with him.Fortunately, Yang Jing was here and the shopkeeper of this shop was very talkative. He asked his son to buy two clay pots with wooden corks and filled them for Jiang Zhen with vinegar and soy sauce. Of course, the cost of the clay pots was paid by Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen had already spent two hundred copper pennies when he came out of this shop. This was only because he didn\u2019t really care much about food and drink, so he didn\u2019t buy spices or sugar.It\u2019s not easy for ancient people to earn money, but because of their low productivity, the prices of goods are very high . . .\u201cI didn\u2019t expect salt to be so expensive.\u201d Leaving the shop, Jiang Zhen frowned slightly. This was still the coastal area and salt was already so expensive. What about the inland then?\u201cBoss, in fact, if you didn\u2019t buy it here, there are cheaper places . . . \u201d Yang Jing said and suddenly shut his mouth again.After some reflection, Jiang Zhen already guessed what Yang Jiang meant. Was Yang Jing talking about private salt?Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t ask again but said, \u201cI\u2019m going to buy some cloth.\u201d\u201cThe cloth shop is there!\u201d Yang Jiang hurriedly showed the way.Jiang Zhen was led by Yang Jing to the cloth shop, and behind them, Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s expression was particularly ugly.When Yang Jing saw Jiang Zhen and ran after him, he followed them. At first, he thought that Yang Jing would make trouble for Jiang Zhen, but what was the result? Yang Jing not only didn\u2019t try to find trouble with Jiang Zhen but also bowed to him!What\u2019s going on here?Jiang Chengxiang didn\u2019t understand how all of this happened. Why did everything suddenly change in the twinkling of an eye, just when he married a satisfactory wife and was about to have a beautiful life?He thought of his return home in the county town last night. As Zhu Shufen didn\u2019t come back and he couldn\u2019t cook, he could only go to sleep hungry. Today, he came to work with his injured leg and was troubled by Yang Jing. Jiang Chengxiang felt unlucky.Forget it. What is with this big brother of mine? How can Yang Jiang be so flattering towards him?Jiang Chengxiang was very angry, but he didn\u2019t dare to make trouble for Jiang Zhen when he thought of what happened the other day. Finally, he decided he could only go back to the dock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Zhen knew it. When he saw Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s face becoming ugly, he was in a very good mood.Jiang Chengwen, one of Eldest Jiang\u2019s two younger brothers, was the first one born after Butcher Jiang returned from the army. Old lady Jiang loved Jiang Chengwen very much. She personally took care of him and, from an early age, gave him whatever he wanted.Because of this, Jiang Chengwen was very lazy and couldn\u2019t do anything. In the past, he shouted at Eldest Jiang and didn\u2019t take him seriously, but this didn\u2019t make Eldest Jiang sad. After all, he was used to being treated like that.But Jiang Chengxiang was different.Old lady Jiang couldn\u2019t take care of both children. After giving birth to Jiang Chengxiang, she gave him to Eldest Jiang, who had never been close to anyone. He liked his younger brother very much. He did his best to take good care of him.Although Eldest Jiang was eight years old at that time, he was extremely thin because of malnutrition, but even so, he was very conscientious and did a good job feeding Jiang Chengxiang rice, washing his diapers, and so on. Jiang Chengxiang slept with him, and as long as he hummed a few times at night, he would get up and take Jiang Chengxiang to pee no matter how cold it was. This lasted until Jiang Chengxiang became four or five years old.He and Jiang Chengxiang were almost inseparable. Even if he went out to cut pig grass, he would carry Jiang Chengxiang on his back and take him with him. He was afraid that Jiang Chengxiang would fall and starve if he left his sight.Because of this, when Jiang Chengxiang was a little boy, the closest person to him was Eldest Jiang. When he saw him he had to be hugged by Eldest Jiang. And Eldest Jiang, because of his brother\u2019s closeness, grew more and more fond of him. As long as his brother was happy, he would do anything he wanted.Jiang Chengxiang was close to Eldest Jiang, which made old lady Jiang and Butcher Jiang not like him as much as they liked Jiang Chengwen. When Jiang Chengxiang was young, he did not notice this but when he got a little older, he felt it.Jiang Chengwen followed old lady Jiang and didn\u2019t have to do any work, and she would only put delicious food in his mouth. He followed Eldest Jiang but never received such treatment. When Jiang Xiaomei was born, old lady Jiang even neglected him.When Jiang Chengwen was playing at home, Eldest Jiang would take him to cut pig grass. When Jiang Chengwen had a water fight with other children, he would only stand by the basin when Eldest Jiang was washing clothes. When Jiang Chengwen was given snacks by old lady Jiang . . . Eldest Jiang could only pick up a few sweet mulberries for him.Jiang Chengxiang started getting closer to old lady Jiang and tried to get her attention.There was nothing wrong with him doing so. Although Eldest Jiang was sad, he wouldn\u2019t try to stop him. After all, Eldest Jiang himself wanted to be close to his mother in his heart. But Jiang Chengxiang unexpectedly even stepped on Eldest Jiang to sell himself to old lady Jiang.He would intentionally wet his bed and run crying to old lady Jiang to tell her that Eldest Jiang didn\u2019t allow him to pee. He also lied to old lady Jiang about Eldest Jiang beating him and giving him only things to eat he didn\u2019t want to eat himself. He also told old lady Jiang that Eldest Jiang had robbed him of his food . . .Old lady Jiang didn\u2019t like Eldest Jiang in the first place, so she naturally believed him. Because she felt that Jiang Chengxiang had suffered a lot, she became better and better to him. When Jiang Chengxiang got a chance later, he even went beyond Jiang Chengwen in her heart.Where was Eldest Jiang? Every time Jiang Chengxiang went to cry to old lady Jiang, he would be beaten. Finally, they completely beat off the little liveliness the child running around the village had. He was beaten to the ground.The original Eldest Jiang was brainwashed. Although he was sad and miserable, he also felt that no one liked him because he was not good enough, so that he could only endure all those sufferings in silence. He didn\u2019t even blame Jiang Chengxiang. Later, when he took care of his younger sister, he did a good job and, in addition, became silent.But when Jiang Zhen saw his memory, he became disgusted with Jiang Chengxiang.Especially . . .Before, when Eldest Jiang had fever and starved to death in the broken hut, although it was because of old lady Jiang\u2019s command, that Jiang Chengwen pushed the cart was mainly caused by Jiang Chengxiang saying, \u201cI\u2019m getting married soon. It\u2019s a bit unlucky to live in the same home as a sick person.\u201dJiang Chengwen was not good, but Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s heart was black.If it wasn\u2019t for this man\u2019s selfish and unscrupulous ways, he wouldn\u2019t be able, as a young man of less than 20 years of age and with no background or ability, to get a good job of earning two silver a month at the dock.That\u2019s why Jiang Zhen targeted Jiang Chengxiang a bit before.\u201cBoss, that Jiang Chengxiang . . .\u201d Yang Jing also noticed Jiang Chengxiang and asked in a low voice. Although their family had separated, if this evil star still had feelings for his little brother . . . it would make it difficult for him to deal with Jiang Chengxiang.\u201cHe has nothing to do with me,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. He was not Eldest Jiang. Jiang Chengxiang had nothing to do with him.\u201cI see!\u201d said Yang Jing. Since Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t like Jiang Chengxiang, he didn\u2019t have to go easy on him in the future.Jiang Zhen took a look at Yang Jing and thought the man had good qualifications.Jiang Zhen bought some of the cheapest cloth in the cloth shop. In fact, he intended to buy ready-made clothes, but the cloth shop did not sell ready-made clothes.However, the cloth shop still introduced two tailors to him, saying that he could ask the tailors to make clothes, but they would charge for it.Although Jiang Zhen got a sum of money from the Jiang family, he still hadn\u2019t started any business to make a living. Forty silver wasn\u2019t much to be spent. After thinking about it, he decided to buy cloth, thread, and needles to make his own clothes.He didn\u2019t have the patience for embroidery or anything like that. He could sew a set of clothes from several pieces of cloth and it should be okay . . . Men\u2019s unwillingness to do housework was not because they couldn\u2019t learn or couldn\u2019t do it well. It was simply because they were lazy and unwilling to do it. They sewed clothes without pursuing good looks. Sewing a set of clothes, why not just pursue sewing good-looking single women? That would do for them?Jiang Zhen always took care of his daily life himself. His meals might not be delicious, but he could also buy some. He didn\u2019t like to do housework, but he could also make his home clean and tidy. Occasionally, his clothes were worn down so he mended them himself . . . In modern times, he did better as a man than many single girls.Of course, if anyone was willing to cook and do the housework for him, he would be very happy . . . Jiang Zhen looked at the cloth in his hand and suddenly thought of Zhao Jinge.Now that he came to the county town, he would like to buy some gifts for Zhao Jinge.Jiang Zhen wandered on the streets of the county town. As he walked, he bought a lot of things, such as rainproof straw raincoats, bamboo baskets, bowls and jars, and other things.Because of Yang Jing\u2019s presence, Jiang Zhen spent less money when he bought things, but he still spent three silver, which made him feel a little distressed. He felt that the matter of making money became urgent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When he saw him while plowing the land, he stopped. Jiang Zhen smiled at him and went to the nearby trees.After a while, Zhao Jinge followed too.\u201cSomething wrong?\u201d Zhao Jinge squeezed the hoe handle in his hand. He was a little afraid to see Jiang Zhen. He and Jiang Zhen were very close these nights, which made him feel embarrassed when he saw Jiang Zhen during the day.What\u2019s more . . . if they went in the woods like this and someone saw them, they would be despised and wouldn\u2019t be able to do anything against it.\u201cI went shopping in the county town today and brought you a gift,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.A gift? Zhao Jinge looked up at Jiang Zhen, surprised and a little at loss.When a man in the village meets a woman or a ger he likes, he will go to the county town to buy some presents for them. If the ger or woman receives them, he can start asking a matchmaker to propose to their parents.Of course, there were also people like He Qiusheng who received gifts but didn\u2019t want to talk to anyone about marriage.Jiang Zhen kissed me before, and I think he likes me too. This is . . . Did he go to the county town to buy me gifts?He once saw a ger or a woman in the village receive rouge, face powder, a hairpin and a handkerchief given to them by the men who adored them. Jiang Zhen also wanted to give him these?He was ugly, so it was good to dress like a man. If he used rouge and face powder like the other gers and hairpins to pin up his hair, it would be very ugly . . .If Jiang Zhen sent him something just to find this out, would he be disappointed?Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t like these things, but at the same time, he still pondered about how to use them if Jiang Zhen gave them to him.Zhao Jinge bowed his head and didn\u2019t speak, and Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know what he was thinking at all. He just gave him a bamboo basket. \u201cHere. Find a reason to take them home.\u201dThere was some noise in the bamboo basket, and it was obvious that there were living creatures inside. Zhao Jinge took the bamboo basket and looked inside. In the basket he saw five fluffy ducklings.For a while, Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t know whether he should be happy or depressed.At the same time Jiang Zhen said, \u201cLittle ducklings can grow up by eating earthworms, snails, and other things. They don\u2019t need to be fed real food. They are very suitable for your mother to raise. They can be used for eggs or meat.\u201dJiang Zhen wanted to give a gift that would bring real benefits, so he chose five ducklings after thinking about it.In Hexi Village that was near the water, it was much cheaper to raise ducks than chicken because ducks didn\u2019t need to eat feed, and they would find snails and other things to eat in the ditches.However, people prefered to raise chicken. The eggs laid by ducks were not as delicious as the chicken eggs with their light egg smell. Also ducks did not lay as many eggs as chickens. In addition, ducks often laid eggs outside.Not to mention that ducks did not have as much meat as chicken. The ducks in ancient times were a little small indeed.But even so, it\u2019s a symbol of a prosperous life to raise some chicken and ducks at home. However, if the Zhao family wanted to raise chicken or ducks in the past, they didn\u2019t have enough food to raise them.\u201cMy mother is in poor health . . . \u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cJust make a fence to keep the ducks from running away, and it won\u2019t be hard to raise them. As for the food, I\u2019ll bring it to you when I catch some fish and shrimps,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. In fact, there was another reason why he decided to send ducklings to Zhao Jinge. He wanted to find something for his mother-in-law to do.His mother-in-law was said to be in poor health, but she didn\u2019t look too bad either. It\u2019s just that Zhao Jinge and Zhao Fugui were working outside, and she thought about different things all by herself at home and didn\u2019t even go out for a walk. She also ate poorly so her body was weak.It\u2019s definitely good for her to keep ducks around.\u201cNo, I can catch food for them myself,\u201d Zhao Jinge hurriedly said after pondering for a while. He felt that raising ducks was really a good idea. \u201cWhen they grow up, we will share them.\u201d The ducklings were bought by Jiang Zhen. When they grow, Jiang Zhen should have his share.\u201cGood,\u201d Jiang Zhen agreed. It will take three months for the ducks to grow up. By that time, he would no longer have to sneak to Zhao Jinge like he did now.After giving the ducklings to Zhao Jinge, Jiang Zhen went back. Looking at Jiang Zhen\u2019s back, Zhao Jinge felt somehow lost.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t give him rouge or a hairpin. Was it because he was too ugly?However, when his eyes fell on those ducklings, Zhao Jinge smiled again. He and Jiang Zhen planned to spend their lives together because they were suitable for each other. So was he thinking too much? Rouge, hairpins, and so on, could they benefit them like ducks would?After receiving these five fluffy ducklings, Zhao Jinge was even more energetic in his work. He picked up some earthworms, collecting them easily when looking down at the soil.Ducks love to eat them.After work that night, Zhao Jinge walked home with the ducklings on his back. He was in a good mood. Then he saw Jiang Zhen sitting by the side of the road, his eyes fixed on him, as if he was going to strip him of all his clothes.Lowering his head, he subconsciously quickened his pace until he entered his family\u2019s house. With a sigh of relief, his heart rate slowly stabilized.\u201cJinge, you\u2019re back,\u201d Zhao Liu welcomed him.\u201cUm,\u201d Zhao Jinge nodded and gave the bamboo basket in his hand to Zhao Liu. Without waiting for Zhao Liu to ask, he said, \u201cMother, someone came with chicken and ducklings to sell. I have bought five ducklings. Keep them.\u201dZhao Jinge had some money on his hand, and Zhao Liu didn\u2019t doubt his words. She took the ducklings away and said very happily, \u201cI always wanted to raise something for a long time, that is . . .\u201d Their family didn\u2019t have much money. Chicken and ducklings cost 10 pennies each. It\u2019s not easy for them to raise them because there\u2019s no food in their family. Even if they bought some, they could only starve them to death . . .Moreover, Zhao Fugui always felt that she was in poor health, so he was not willing to let her do much work.Zhao Liu touched a few ducklings and took out the earthworms that Zhao Jinge had thrown inside the basket. With a smile on her face, she cut them into small pieces with scissors for the ducklings to eat.It was just that her smile soon disappeared.\u201cJinge, recently Jiang Zhen always stares at our house fiercely, and he was staring at you just now. This . . .\u201d When Zhao Liu went out to pick vegetables today, she saw Jiang Zhen staring at her not far away. She became scared, and just now, she saw Jiang Zhen staring at her son by the roadside.They were a single family that didn\u2019t have anyone to help them. If Jiang Zhen had any bad thoughts about them, what could they do?Zhao Jinge: \u201c. . .\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He even dared to fight and scold an official,\u201d Zhao Liu said. That Eldest Jiang was the most daring person she had ever seen in her life.\u201cThat\u2019s because they were going to arrest him,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. \u201cHe made such a big commotion before but did he do anything to someone else in the end?\u201d When he saw Jiang Zhen beating people before, he didn\u2019t think it was a very good idea, but now, after thinking about it, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t do anything to the Jiang family. He only took some food and silver. . .He used to live in the Jiang family house, but he was even more miserable than him who was a long-term worker. Even if the masters of long-term workers were stingy, they still had to give what should be given. If he didn\u2019t have to support his family, he would certainly be able to fill his stomach every day. But Jiang Zhen? When did he have enough to eat? During the busy farming season, those long-term workers could also eat fish and even rice. However, he only saw Eldest Jiang eating raw lettuce, radish, or a cucumber in the field.Zhao Liu thought about it too. Old lady Jiang only spent some money in spite of crying for several days. She had actually spent more money on Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s marriage before, but she hadn\u2019t seen her distressed over that.However, Jiang Zhen was still frightening . . . \u201cAnyway, let\u2019s stay far away from him. Jinge, you can\u2019t fight against him.\u201dZhao Jinge was not a talker and couldn\u2019t speak well, so he could only stay silent this time.In fact, he had the intention of telling his mother about him and Jiang Zhen, but he was afraid that his mother would be angry, so he did not dare to say it. Meeting Jiang Zhen in the middle of the night was certainly wrong of him and even a little shameless.Zhao Jinge thought it was wrong to have a rendezvous with someone at night, but he still went to Jiang Zhen\u2019s place that night. There, in the light of the fire pot and candles, he saw Jiang Zhen sewing clothes while looking at old clothes to study.\u201cYou are sewing clothes?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked.\u201cHave you sewn clothes before? Can you teach me?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at Zhao Jinge. He had seen Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s clothes. The stitches were not too tight, and he could copy them somehow, but he needed to be careful when cutting the cloth.\u201cI\u2019ll do it for you,\u201d Zhao Jinge blurted out. He had never seen an adult man make his own clothes. Even if a family consisted only of a single bachelor, he would catch some fish for some old lady in the village to make her help him make clothes.But Jiang Zhen . . . No one would be willing to help him except for me.\u201cJust teach me. I\u2019m free these days anyway,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. Although he had hit people very hard before, in fact, this body wasn\u2019t in good health at all.Eldest Jiang used to work so much all the time. If he didn\u2019t pay attention now, he was afraid he would die before living to his forties.That\u2019s why, although he wanted to make money, Jiang Zhen decided to put it off for half a month and think first about what he could do.Zhao Jinge could make clothes, but he hadn\u2019t used a a needle or thread for a long time, so he was somewhat rusty.However, he still somehow taught Jiang Zhen how to cut the cloth and helped him cut out several pieces. Before leaving, he said, \u201cJiang Zhen, maybe I can help you do the sewing? I\u2019ll do it in my room, so no one else will know.\u201dJiang Zhen was afraid that Zhao Jinge\u2019s parents would find out so he didn\u2019t dare to let him do it, but to be honest, he really wanted to wear clothes made by Zhao Jinge. . .\u201cMake me a pair of trousers,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. After the pants were cut, there were fewer places to sew compared to other clothes, so pants were easier to sew and make quickly.Zhao Jinge\u2019s hands shook when he heard these words. To make pants . . . pants. . .Zhao Jinge soon clenched his teeth, took the cloth, and left. When he left, Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t help laughing.He liked to see Zhao Jinge\u2019s shyness; it even gave him a reaction.After the trouble with the Jiang family was solved and Eldest Jiang left his body, he couldn\u2019t help but want to get Zhao Jinge in his bed immediately. . .That evening, Jiang Zhen solved his physiological needs himself and sighed again. In some aspects this body\u2019s abilities were simply incomparable with his original body\u2019s. The speed was also too fast . . .However, if he exercised well, he thought he could improve.Jiang Zhen slept very well that evening. Early the next morning, he prepared himself some food before going outside.Nowadays, when people in Hexi Village saw him, they would take a detour, but people in the other villages obviously didn\u2019t know about his fame. Now, a person who picked up two loads of goods to sell in Hexi Village greeted him.\u201cBig brother, do you want to buy some incense and paper money?\u201d Jiang Zhen was now well-dressed and his temperament was totally different from that of ordinary farmers, so he was greeted very enthusiastically.\u201cPaper money?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at him in bewilderment.\u201cYes, isn\u2019t it Qingming soon? I\u2019m sure every family should have some!\u201d That human sympathy.Jiang Zhen calculated the time in his head and found out that tomorrow was Qingming.He was alone in this world for the time being, and there was no one at all who he could worship. So there was no need to buy this stuff. Jiang Zhen was just about to leave when he suddenly thought of someone. He spent 20 copper pennies to buy some paper money.After leaving the paper money at home, Jiang Zhen went out again with a bamboo basket and searched for small fish and shrimps everywhere. When he passed the fishing boat on the river, he was also greeted by the man who was busily working on the boat.The next day was Qingming Festival.Jiang Zhen got up early the next morning; he discovered it was raining outside. He hurriedly got dressed and went to check on his chicken first.Although the thatched cottage was leaking, it didn\u2019t leak very much. The chicken hiding in a corner not only had not get caught in the rain, but had also laid an egg, looking like it was in good spirits. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t want to disrupt it and went back to his house.This chicken could defecate anywhere. Some people would lock their chicken in the house to prevent them from freezing at night, but he was not very happy with this solution.But since he was now free, it was better to fix the leaking thatched cottage.Since it rained that day, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t go out to catch fish. He used the morning to fix the thatched cottage, and in the afternoon he began sewing his clothes.He was too impatient to sew the stitches carefully and slowly. When he made clothes, he made them quickly by hand. He managed to make one set of clothes in the afternoon. Of course, it was not surprising that the clothes turned out ugly.But in a place where many people\u2019s clothes were full of patches, wearing such clothes was nothing.On that day, in addition to his work, Jiang Zhen went to the fixed thatched house to burn all the paper money he had bought.He burned it for Eldest Jiang.Jiang Zhen originally thought that, after the Qingming Festival, he would look around to find a way to make a living while improving his health. However, his plan could not catch up with the rapid changes.After the Qingming Festival, it rained for seven or eight days in a row. It finally stopped for a day only to start raining again the next day, making the whole world moist.Jiang Zhen was bored at home for several days. He did all the work he had to do at home, but the rain still didn\u2019t stop.In fact, he went out in a coir raincoat, but it was very difficult to catch fish on rainy days. If he got caught in the rain outside and caught a cold, it would be very difficult for him, so he didn\u2019t go outside again. Instead, he relied on pickled pork and rice to eat every day.But while Jiang Zhen could have a good rest at home, Zhao Jinge couldn\u2019t. Even if it rained, he still had to go to work.It was very tiring to do farm work on rainy days, and often, at the end of the day, Zhao Jinge was exhausted. Jiang Zhen took care of him and didn\u2019t call him out at night. Instead, he secretly delivered some food to him at noon like before.Probably because of the good food, Zhao Jinge, who always lost a lot of weight in the past rainy seasons, had a rosy face and an excellent spirit this year.That day, Jiang Zhen put on the coir raincoat and went out again.Recently, when it rained every day, all the earthworms in the fields crawled out. From time to time, many earthworms could be seen on the surface of the dirt road. Jiang Zhen caught them all on his way. When he met Zhao Jinge, he had already caught more than 20 earthworms, which was enough to feed the five ducklings that Zhao Liu kept at home.Jiang Zhen came to deliver him food every day. Zhao Jinge was very uncomfortable at first and wanted to refuse. But now he had learned to accept it; however, he still brought something to Jiang Zhen every day. For example, today, he gave Jiang Zhen a basket full of various vegetables and a few loaches.\u201cI caught four or five loaches, but you can also eat them if you steam them on the steaming rack.\u201d Zhao Jinge said. He was embarrassed that he had eaten Jiang Zhen\u2019s pork but could only send loaches to Jiang Zhen in return.\u201cUm,\u201d Jiang Zhen answered. \u201cCome here.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhao Jinge went to Jiang Zhen and then felt Jiang Zhen hug and kiss him.Zhao Jinge was stunned but soon calmed down. At first, when he was kissed by Jiang Zhen, he only felt that something was wrong with his body, but now, he was much more affected by Jiang Zhen, and he slowly got used to it.Jiang Zhen liked to kiss, just kiss . . . He looked so ugly, but Jiang Zhen would still kiss him. It was really formidable.While thinking about it, Zhao Jinge suddenly felt something slippery on his lips.Jiang Zhen had licked his mouth with his tongue!This . . . This . . . Was Jiang Zhen not too perverted?Zhao Jinge, who never knew that something like French kiss existed, just licked his own lips and was confused once again.Seeing him like that, Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t help laughing. Then he picked up the vegetables Zhao Jinge had prepared for him and left quickly.When Jiang Zhen was going back, he was in a good mood. However, he was only halfway there when he heard the suppressed crying of a man.It was not raining hard that day, just a drizzle, but with the sound of the rain, the man\u2019s crying was particularly sad, and the pain evoked was magnified a lot.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t want to meddle in someone else\u2019s business, but he suddenly found that the crying was a little familiar . . . As he walked to the place where the sound of crying came from, he saw the fisherman who had traded fish for his hedgehog. He was squatting under a camphor tree, crying. His clothes and hair were all wet, but he seemed to be unaware of it.Jiang Zhen had been in contact with the fisherman several times, and he was always pretty quiet. Now he was surprised to see him crying so sadly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked with a frown.The fisherman looked up at Jiang Zhen, wiped his face, and stood up. \u201cNothing.\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked again.\u201cI . . .\u201d The man choked. \u201cMy wife, I\u2019m afraid he\u2019s going to die.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had also seen his two children catching shrimps by the river, but he had never seen his wife. Unexpectedly, he was dying.\u201cSick.\u201d The man touched his face again and wiped away the rain mixed with his tears.Fishermen didn\u2019t live very well.They didn\u2019t have their own land or place to stay. Although they could catch fish and sell it for money, their income was actually very small, and they could only support a day-to-day existence. Once they got sick, they could only wait.At first, his wife just had a stomachache, and he didn\u2019t take it seriously. As a result, he had been vomiting and burning up these days, and he had become very thin. . .Yesterday, when it was sunny, he took all his savings and took him to see a doctor. As a result, the doctor said that it would take at least twenty or thirty silver to cure him, but he could not guarantee that it would work. And if they could not cure his illness, then they could only wait for his death.He had come here with his boat from far away to earn a living. He had no relatives here and no place to borrow money from. The only thing he owned worth some money was his boat, but the people who needed a boat here did not lack a boat. And nobody else needed a boat . . . Who would buy such a broken boat?What\u2019s more, that boat was his home. If they sell it, their family would have no place to go.The fisherman\u2019s name was Wang Haisheng. The wife he spoke of was actually a ger named Sun Xiaoshan. He had picked him up from the river.For people like him who have no land of their own or any foothold, and live on a boat, it was very difficult to find a wife.People who cherish their children even a little wouldn\u2019t marry their daughters or gers to a person who didn\u2019t have a fixed residence. So Wang Haisheng, like Eldest Jiang, was in his mid-twenties and still hadn\u2019t gotten a wife.Then one day while he was catching fish, he saw someone floating from the distance; he picked up a ger.This Sun Xiaoshan also had a bitter fate; his mother died early, and his father married another woman, who treated him badly. Later, when he was only fifteen or sixteen years old, he was sold to an old man in his forties.After he got married, the old man was nice to him, and he was able to live a good life for a while. However, within two years, the old man died of an illness.After the old man died, it was the son of the old man who took charge of the household. It was reasonable to assume that his stepmother should still able to eat well under him; otherwise, he could make him remarry. But the son of the old man had a crooked mind and tried to force him. The wife of the old man\u2019s son became angry, yelled at him to get out and called her family to beat him up.He didn\u2019t want to live any longer, so he threw himself in the river. Later, he was fished up by Wang Haisheng. He was very grateful, so he decided to live with Wang Haisheng.They had been together for ten years and had two children. The elder one was Wang Yuer, a ger and nine years old this year. The younger one was called Wang Daniu. He was six years old this year and was male.In fact, between them, they had another child but they had lost him (due to death, not abandonment).Although their family was poor, they had a happy life, but then Sun Xiaoshan suddenly became ill.As Wang Haisheng spoke, he cried again, and Jiang Zhen frowned.In modern times, people had always complained that it was difficult and expensive to see a doctor, but in fact, compared with ancient times, the price of seeing a doctor was already outrageously low, and it was not difficult at all.In ancient times, it was really difficult and expensive to visit a doctor.There are only a few doctors in Hecheng county. Some of them only knew a little about medicine but it was still difficult to meet them. As for the cost . . .The disease of Zhao Liu, Zhao Jinge\u2019s mother, was by no means serious in modern times. But in ancient times the Zhao family, after a period of treatment, had to sell their land to see a doctor . . .At that time, people in Hexi Village thought Zhao Jinge\u2019s father Zhao Fugui was really ignorant . . . Which of them, in the countryside, did not suffer from an illness? Wasn\u2019t selling land just for treatment nonsense? If Zhao Fugui didn\u2019t sell the land, even if Zhao Liu died, he could still marry some widow to warm his bed. Perhaps she would even be able to give birth to another boy for him.In ancient times, ordinary people couldn\u2019t afford to get sick. When they got sick, they could only wait to get better. Wang Haisheng\u2019s wife was ill and needed urgent treatment. He had no money to treat him, so there was no other way but to wait for him to die.\u201cLet me take a look,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.\u201cYou can cure him?\u201d Wang Haisheng looked at Jiang Zhen in surprise. Although he had lived on this side of Hexi Village for some time, people in the village excluded him and didn\u2019t keep in touch with him. He didn\u2019t come into contact with people from the village so often, so he didn\u2019t know about Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen looked very magnanimous, so he thought that he knew how to cure some diseases. Most villages don\u2019t have doctors, but occasionally there are some people who know a little about herbs.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t speak. Of course, he won\u2019t be able to cure the disease. Although he had learned how to provide first aid before, how to stop a bleeding and sew a wound, the other one had a stomachache and fever.If he knew what was wrong with Sun Xiaoshan and there was a modern drugstore nearby, he could get some antipyretic drugs simply by finding out the right symptoms, but he could definitely not take his pulse and figure out what was wrong with him!He wanted to see if Sun Xiaoshan could still survive.Wang Haisheng secretly looked at Jiang Zhen and saw Jiang Zhen\u2019s expressionless and motionless appearance. His heart calmed down inexplicably and was no longer as sad and desperate as he was at the beginning.Wang Haisheng took Jiang Zhen to his boat.It was already rainy and humid in the south of the Yangtze River. Although people here were used to this climate, it had been raining heavily recently, which also made them very uncomfortable. Jiang Zhen felt that the humidity in his home was too high, so he almost used up all the firewood piled up at his thatched cottage to light a fire in order to remove some of the humidity inside his home.As a result, his mud house became wet, but the ship was much wetter than his mud house! Among other things, this environment was not suitable for a sick person to live in.When Jiang Zhen entered the cabin and saw that there was a moldy fish hanging inside, he was even more speechless.Wang Haisheng was also a little embarrassed. Fish had no value to him. He pulled the fish and directly threw it in the river. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to clean up my house these two days . . .\u201dOf course, it\u2019s also the humid weather that made things go moldy easily.\u201cDaddy!\u201d Two children came over; their eyes were red. They had been crying before they came inside.\u201cHow is your mother?\u201d Wang Haisheng had cried hard before, but in front of his two children, he was very calm. The family needed his support.\u201cMother vomited again. He also vomited bitter water.\u201d The bigger one with a red cinnabar mole in the middle of his eyebrow choked with sobs.Jiang Zhen frowned and took two steps inside before he saw the sick ger on the bed.At times like these, big families were very fastidious. They would never allow a man to go near a ger in bed, but poor families didn\u2019t care. Wang Haisheng also took the initiative to ask Jiang Zhen to see his wife.\u201cIs there any hot water at home? Do you have any sugar?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cThere is hot water and some brown sugar,\u201d Wang Haisheng said. They usually buy food to eat, so he had a few silver, but not enough to see a doctor.When the doctor said that he could only wait for his wife\u2019s death he thought that, at least, he should let his wife eat better before he died, so he went to buy some food. The brown sugar was bought at that time.Sun Xiaoshan couldn\u2019t eat the past two days, so they had been giving him hot sugar water, so there was also some hot water.\u201cMake some sugar water and add some salt for him to drink,\u201d said Jiang Zhen. Once a person who vomited was seriously dehydrated, it would be hopeless.\u201cYuer, go get it,\u201d Wang Haisheng said to his elder son and looked at Jiang Zhen. \u201cAnd then what?\u201d\u201cDo you want to sell this boat?\u201d Jiang Zhen suddenly asked.\u201cTwenty silver\u2014no, fifteen silver for sale.\u201d Wang Haisheng didn\u2019t want to say he had been looking for a buyer before, but even if some people have money, they would rather buy land than buy his boat.\u201cTwenty silver, I will buy your boat,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. \u201cI\u2019ll go back to get the money, and then we\u2019ll go to the county town to treat your wife. I can\u2019t cure his illness.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He was not surprised when Jiang Zhen said he couldn\u2019t cure him. However, Jiang Zhen\u2019s willingness to buy his boat made him ecstatic. \u201cYou . . . Do you really want to buy my boat?\u201d His ship, in fact, was a bit broken . . .\u201cUm.\u201d Jiang Zhen nodded, then jumped off the boat and went to his house.He had been thinking about buying a boat since he decided to become a merchant to make money, but he couldn\u2019t row.This time, if this matter could be settled, he would not only have a boat, but also a rower . . . even though the ship was shabby.When Jiang Zhen returned with the silver, he saw Wang Haisheng, who was in his thirties, standing at the bow of the ship with tears in his eyes.Wang Haisheng also knew that his boat was definitely not worth 20 silver. You could get a new boat by getting some wood and finding someone to make a boat. You could get a new boat for 10 silver. So the man who used a hedgehog to trade fish with him was actually helping him.Although he was worried about where he would live after selling his boat, Wang Haisheng was still full of hope and gratitude.While Wang Haisheng rowed, Jiang Zhen would not row for fear of standing in his way. Instead, he said, \u201cI plan to go out and do some business later, so you can row for me, and I won\u2019t let your family starve to death.\u201dWang Haisheng was stunned at first and could not react, but soon, he realized that Jiang Zhen had given him a way to make a living.The man who had been living on the boat through wind and rain, now cried again, \u201cThank you, thank you!\u201d After crying, he rowed even faster.It wasn\u2019t long before they came to the county town.Spring rain usually didn\u2019t last long. When they got to the county town, the rain had just stopped.Wang Haisheng carried the drowsy Sun Xiaoshan and went ashore together with Jiang Zhen, leaving his two children to watch the house while they went to the pharmacy.Jiang Zhen threw him twenty silver. \u201cYou go first. I\u2019ll call someone.\u201dWang Haisheng did not know who Jiang Zhen was going to call. He took the silver and walked towards the pharmacy quickly, almost running.Jiang Zhen took a look at him and went to find Yang Jing.It rained today, so instead of going out on a patrol, Yang Jing stayed at home.In front of the yamen, they received filial piety from a businessman. The man above took the big share, but those at the bottom could still share some soup and water. Yang Jing took three silver home and asked his wife to buy meat.He didn\u2019t like to stay at home before, but these days, since it was raining, he stayed at home every day and suddenly found it quite comfortable.Perhaps it was because he had been staying at home all day that his wife didn\u2019t talk to him all day long, and his two children were getting closer to him.Although his wife was fat, the meat hug was actually quite comfortable. She was not worse than the lover he liked before, and he didn\u2019t need to worry about her asking for this and that, and his two children . . .These days, his two children brought him water to wash his feet and massaged his back. They were very clever. Yang Jiang looked at them and thought of the scene of Jiang Zhen stabbing Butcher Jiang in the thigh.Yang Jing was telling his two children about his heroic attitude in handling cases, when someone knocked on the door of his house. He said, \u201cDamao, open the door.\u201dYang Damao soon opened the door, and Yang Jing glanced out to see Boss Jiang.Yang Jiang, who looked relaxed a moment ago, quickly got up from the reclining chair and greeted Jiang Zhen with a smile, \u201cBoss, you are here!\u201d\u201cWell, come out with me,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen was a bit rude like this. If someone else did this, they might have been driven out by Yang Jiang. But he didn\u2019t dare to drive out Jiang Zhen, so he quickly cleaned himself up and went with Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen first took Yang Jiang to the pharmacy.The people in the pharmacy did not take Wang Haisheng, a fisherman with no fixed residence, seriously at all. He might have even been swindled, but it was a different situation when Yang Jiang swung by.Even if the people in the pharmacy were not afraid of the yamen, when they saw that Wang Haisheng knew the yamen officer, they would pay more attention when treating Sun Xiaoshan.Jiang Zhen thought correctly.The people in the pharmacy were not afraid of Yang Jiang, and Yang Jiang was also polite to the doctor in the pharmacy. However, with Yang Jiang around, the people in the pharmacy became much politer to Wang Haisheng. At first, they didn\u2019t allow Sun Xiaoshan to stay in the pharmacy, but later, they even let Sun Xiaoshan live in the patients\u2019 resting room behind the pharmacy.Jiang Zhen was not a doctor, so it was not interesting for him to stay there. Seeing that things had been arranged, he didn\u2019t stay but went out with Yang Jing. \u201cLet\u2019s go to the market for a walk.\u201dThe two of them strolled around the market. During that time, Jiang Zhen also found that the market was different from that of later generations, or rather, the consumption needs of the people from these times were different from those of later generations.These days, the rich didn\u2019t care about spending money casually, but the common people were different.Common people who have little money are reluctant to spend money, and when they buy things, they choose low prices over considerations of beauty or tastiness. For example, steamed buns of the same size with the same amount of meat in them, but one is delicious though expensive while the other one is not tasty but cheap. In the end, everyone would go buy the cheap one.They don\u2019t pursue quality of life as long as they have enough to eat. It was precisely because of this, that even if Wang Haisheng had a fishing boat and could catch and sell fish, his life was still very ordinary.Fish couldn\u2019t be sold at a reasonable price in the county town. Even though it had been raining recently and there were fewer people selling fish, no one would accept an increased price of fish. If they found out that the price of fish had become more expensive, they would simply choose not to buy or eat fish.Even regarding pork, people in the county town would take advantage of buying more at lower prices. People who came to the county town during the New Year holidays would shell two or three copper pennies for more expensive pork from the butcher\u2019s shop.Of course, the rich were different. They were even willing to spend money that Zhao Jinge couldn\u2019t earn in a year just to eat one meal. With Jiang Zhen\u2019s current capital only, it was impossible to do business with the rich; however, the demands of the poor were too limited. Just like the villagers from Hexi Village, they were basically self-sufficient.If he was willing to travel long distances and bring cheap silk and other goods here to the north, he would definitely make money, however . . .How was he going to get there? If there was trouble on the road, how would he solve it? What would he eat and where would he live?He didn\u2019t know anything, so should he just take the goods and leave?What\u2019s more, if he was gone for a few months . . . what about Zhao Jinge?After looking around, Jiang Zhen suddenly looked at Yang Jiang. \u201cHow much do you know about the \u2018private\u2019 (black market) salt?\u201dLast time he bought salt, he spent 35 copper pennies for a kilo of salt. In modern times, that\u2019s thirty-five dollars for a kilo of salt.How much profit is this? This town is very close to the seaside .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 36": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 32 - Sea salt and sea goodsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32 \u2013 Sea salt and sea goods\u201cPrivate salt? You-You-You . . .\u201d Yang Jing instantly turned pale and suddenly closed his mouth, looking left and right.He was relieved when he found that there was no one near them and then said, \u201cAre you crazy? This is a capital crime punished by beheading!\u201dEveryone would buy private salt, but the idea of selling private salt . . .\u201cI know,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, 'so I want to know about the situation from you.\u201d Jiang Zhen had some knowledge about the ancient private salt business.No matter which dynasty or generation, the private salt business was rampant. There was no other way. Legal salt has always been too expensive.They were on the coast, and legal salt was sold for 40 copper pennies for a kilo. Its quality was not good . . . So what about the inland?Before, when Jiang Zhen read history books, he happened to see the records of some local officials selling salt for two silver per kilo. It was no wonder that ordinary people weren\u2019t able to consume salt at all, and everyone would buy private salt.Of course, although he came up with the idea of selling private salt, he didn\u2019t plan on doing it right away or blindly walking on this road. He knew that it would be OK to earn some initial funds by his own skills. It was impossible to make a big profit from selling private salt right at the moment.After all, he had no background whatsoever, and today\u2019s salt smugglers . . .For such a big profit, even those private salt dealers had all exceptional backgrounds.Yang Jing looked at Jiang Zhen a few times, and seeing that Jiang Zhen was very calm, as if they were talking about what to eat later, an idea suddenly came to him. Should I encourage Jiang Zhen to sell private salt, so that he can be beheaded?As soon as this idea of Yang Jing was born, he immediately suppressed it.Even if Jiang Zhen were to sell salt, those private dealers might not be able to catch him, and it would mean he would become even more vicious in the future.That\u2019s what Yang Jing was thinking, but he still said everything he knew about private salt. \u201cI\u2019ve caught this private salt dealer, and I know a little about the inside situation . . .\u201dJust east of Hecheng County, there was the Hongjiang salt field that belonged to the imperial court, and the nearest official salt supply came from there. But at the same time, most of the close-by private salt also came from there.To put it simply, after the salt was produced in the salt farm, some of the salt was sold as official salt while some was sold to private salt dealers.As Jiang Zhen thought, no one would remain unmoved by such large profits. But ordinary people, even if they were tempted, they only dared to boil some salt for sale secretly. The people who really dared to make a fortune out of it were all big shots with backgrounds.They had money and people, captained big boats, swaggered to the salt farm to buy salt, and sent it to other places. They were very arrogant, but no one dared to check them out.\u201cBoss, I won\u2019t hide it from you. We usually catch smugglers who secretly sell hundreds of kilograms of salt. It\u2019s these really big people that we don\u2019t dare to touch. We would even avoid the big people\u2019s subordinates. They are also very smooth when they sell salt. They would even pay the toll when they come to sell salt,\u201d Yang Jing said. \u201cThe illegal salt dealers in Hongjiang salt field are even more powerful than those in our area. Only those small salt dealers who sell 180 kilograms of salt would be caught and killed immediately. But those who catch them and kill them . . . in fact, most of them work directly for those big smugglers.\u201dRural people like Eldest Jiang knew nothing of what Yang Jing said, but in fact, of all the people in this town, the local yamen were very clear about this.Speaking of which, why was the legal salt so expensive? Wasn\u2019t it just to make the private salt sell better? As a matter of fact, legal salt and private salt were actually all sold by the same family here.The Hongjiang salt farm was another\u2019s territory, and no one was allowed to touch it. Therefore, small traders who dared to go to the seaside to sell private salt would be ruthlessly killed as soon as they were spotted.\u201cBefore the imperial court reorganized the salt industry, an imperial emissary was busy for several years. In the end, he only found some abandoned sons and outcasts,\u201d Yang Jing spoke again. The top-level private salt dealers who control countless salt fields would sell their salt to other families. Those families had few connections. They would probably be just a wealthy merchant, and the court could only find them after conducting an investigation every time.Of course, by just finding them, with the confiscated silver, they could already satisfy the court, and one could imagine how much profit there was in this.Hearing Yang Jing\u2019s words, Jiang Zhen knew that legal salt and private salt had created a great network of interests, and all important officials on this side had been entangled in it.Actually, it was not surprising.Nowadays, common people were poor, and the officials, who were secretly trying to raise the taxes which would most likely suffocate the common people, still couldn\u2019t gain much money out of it. If they wanted to make a lot of money, they still needed to rely on those special situations, such as the salt industry.And since they wanted to make money from it, no one was allowed to poach from them, so they hit particularly the hard-to-crack-down small-scale peddlers.This way, it was very difficult for small peddlers to earn money by getting a few hundred kilos of salt.Jiang Zhen wanted to make money, but he really didn\u2019t plan to lose his life. After thinking about it for a moment, he asked, \u201cI think there is also seafood for sale at the market. Where did it come from?\u201dThe main seafood products in Hecheng County are salted fish and dried kelp, both of which are not expensive, so people here like them very much. For example, when entertaining guests, they like to stew a bowl of kelp.\u201cBoss, if you want to join in this business, it\u2019s not difficult. Just hire a boat to go to the seaside to purchase goods. But if there is no special way, people will take it as a way to sell private salt . . .\u201d Yang Jing giggled twice and said, \u201cAnyway, if you go over there, you have to be careful and don\u2019t touch the salt. Of course, if you take three or five kilos, they won\u2019t care.\u201d\u201cDo you have a way?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked again.\u201cI know some people who sell seafood. If you want to go, you can join them.\u201d Yang Jing said. Those who sold seafood were all small peddlers. They were very happy to go together with several additional people, at least for safety reasons.Jiang Zhen nodded and settled the matter with Yang Jing.After that Jiang Zhen went to the pharmacy again.Wang Haisheng was still tending to Sun Xiaoshan. The twenty silver he gave him before was enough to cure his illness. Jiang Zhen greeted him and planned to go home first.He did not rush to bring Wang Haisheng\u2019s boat back home just because he had already given him the money. He believed in Wang Haisheng\u2019s character and believed that, after he had taken Yang Jing with him, Wang Haisheng would not dare to run away with his silver.Wang Haisheng really didn\u2019t have that idea. When he learned that Jiang Zhen was willing to hire him to do business in the future, he was very grateful to Jiang Zhen. He didn\u2019t want to run away at all. Instead, he took Jiang Zhen to the boat and gave him some fish.The fish were not big; they were said to have been caught by Wang Haisheng\u2019s two children in the past two days. They had grown up on that fishing boat since young, and they were already able to fish.Naturally Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t refuse. He took the fish and went home.It had rained for several days in a row, and all the roads were very muddy and hard to traverse. Jiang Zhen, who walked all the way, not only got his clothes and shoes wet but was also covered in mud.Hence, it took Jiang Zhen a lot longer to walk home than usual. When he got home, it was almost dark.He scooped water and washed his feet. Jiang Zhen dealt with the small fishes outside his house. He scraped the scales and dug out the intestines. As he was working hard, he saw five ducklings swinging their butts and waving their little wings in the Zhaos\u2019 vegetable field not far away.It was not raining now, so Zhao Liu let them out for some fresh air.Thinking of this, Jiang Zhen looked around and saw that, not far away, Zhao Liu was holding a cylinder on one side and cutting half of the bamboo on the other side to dig for earthworms.People who raised chicken and ducks in the village often sent their children to dig for earthworms because chicken and ducks grew faster and laid more eggs after eating earthworms, but people Zhao Liu\u2019s age generally didn\u2019t do such things.Jiang Zhen looked at Zhao Liu, who was digging earthworms. He found it a kind of funny, then he cut the fish intestines in his hand with a knife.Jiang Zhen took those fish intestines and went to the Zhao family\u2019s fields. Without looking at Zhao Liu\u2019s frightened eyes, he scattered the fish intestines on the ground.Zhao Liu was afraid of Jiang Zhen, but those ducklings were not afraid of him. They chirped and soon gathered around Jiang Zhen to eat the fish intestines.Jiang Zhen had come back late, but Zhao Jinge came back even later.The reason why the Zhao Dahu family was called a big family in Hexi Village was that this family had a lot of money, land, and the long-term worker Zhao Jinge.Zhao Jinge could still have some free time when the farm was not busy, but when it was busy, he would be busy all the time. Of course, because of his low requirements and his hard work, the Zhao Dahu family would give him something when he was busy farming, like for example the couple of eggs today.When he handed the eggs to Zhao Liu, Zhao Jinge went to the patio to wash the mud from his body. When he took a bath, Zhao Liu had already prepared food for him.When the farm became busy, the Zhao family would also eat dry rice; otherwise, their bodies wouldn\u2019t be able to support them. In addition to the dry rice, Zhao Liu also used the dry rice brought back by Zhao Jinge to make some egg and vegetable soup.\u201cMom, you can have the egg soup,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. Jiang Zhen had sent him a meal at noon, so he had even had meat . . .\u201cI didn\u2019t do anything at home. What kind of egg soup should I eat?\u201d Zhao Liu said, but Zhao Jinge still insisted on leaving half a bowl of egg soup for Zhao Liu.As for Zhao Fugui, he worked as a part-time worker in a place that was a little further away, and he wasn\u2019t able to come home these days.Zhao Jinge was not very talkative, but Zhao Liu liked to talk very much. While watching Zhao Jinge eat, she talked about their family\u2019s affairs. Of course, she also talked about their current neighbor, Jiang Zhen.\u201cJiang Zhen came to feed our ducks with fish intestines today. What do you think his intention is? He won\u2019t steal our ducks when they are raised, will he?\u201d The more Zhao Liu talked, the more worried she got.Old Madam Jiang was a very efficient person. She told the villagers all the things Jiang Zhen had ever done to the Jiang family.In other words, people in the village were now all afraid of Jiang Zhen. They thought that there was something wrong with Jiang Zhen, which was also related to old Madam Jiang\u2019s behaviour.Eldest Jiang never said a word when he was wronged before. Even if they knew that old lady Jiang was not good to him, they didn\u2019t know how bad it had been. Old lady Jiang shouted, so they clearly knew what kind of \u201cevil\u201d things Jiang Zhen had done.It was only when Zhao Liu heard that Jiang Zhen robbed their chicken, that she got worried.\u201cMother, have you ever seen him steal other people\u2019s chicken?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked.Zhao Liu thought about it. Although Jiang Zhen looked everywhere for food, she hadn\u2019t seen him steal other people\u2019s chicken.After thinking about this, Zhao Liu remembered another thing. \u201cJinge, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t grow his own vegetables, and he didn\u2019t come to our house to steal these past two days. What kind of vegetables do you think he ate?\u201dShe was worried because of Jiang Zhen again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Remember to thank her in the comment sectionZhao Jinge was very tired and went to bed early that day, so he didn\u2019t know that Jiang Zhen actually knocked on his window that night.After knocking on the window several times and still not getting any response, Jiang Zhen thought that Zhao Jinge might have gone to bed early, so he went back. But the next morning, he got up early and waited for him on the side of the road.Jiang Zhen saw Zhao Jinge, but he didn\u2019t talk to him. Instead, he winked at him and asked him to pick up the bamboo tube on the side of the road.Inside this bamboo tube was some fish soup that Jiang Zhen had made last night and heated this morning.The two of them were now in regular contact with each other, which was similar to cheating. Jiang Zhen had some regrets, but he also found it quite interesting.Zhao Jinge took the bamboo tube and looked at Jiang Zhen from afar. When he walked towards the Zhao Dahu house with the bamboo tube in his arms, his steps inevitably became much lighter. After walking for a while, he opened the bamboo tube and began to eat slowly.This bamboo tube was still hot; it was obvious that Jiang Zhen wanted him to eat this while it was still hot, so he must not waste it.The fish soup in the bamboo tube was cooked by Jiang Zhen. After the fish bones were removed, he cooked the remaining fish meat with eggs. Not mentioning the taste, at least it was nutritious and there was a lot of fish meat to supplement proteins.Because the fish soup was cooked last night, it tasted a little fishy, but Zhao Jinge did definitely not dislike it. He soon drank it all up, cleaned the bamboo tube with the boiling water that he brought with him these days, and then drank all the water that had been used to clean the bamboo tube.When he got up in the morning, he had a dry meal at home, and now he drank fish soup. He felt his whole body warming up and was full of enthusiasm. He didn\u2019t even feel tired when he worked that morning.In the morning, because it wasn\u2019t raining, Zhao Dahu went to the field for a walk. Seeing Zhao Jinge like that, he nodded in satisfaction.At first, everyone thought that he was muddle-headed to hire a ger to work as a long-term worker. But now, after several years, everyone envied him. It was true that Zhao Jinge worked hard like a man and took his work seriously.But he didn\u2019t know that after he left, Zhao Jinge began to get distracted.It was almost noon; it was almost time for Jiang Zhen to come . . .Although Zhao Jinge felt a bit embarassed eating Jiang Zhen\u2019s food, he was still looking forward to Jiang Zhen coming . . . Although he was still working, Zhao Jinge\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t help but aim at Jiang Zhen\u2019s usual path.However, he didn\u2019t see Jiang Zhen for a long time. Instead, an old woman of fifty or sixty who he was familiar with suddenly showed up.Zhao Jinge looked at her for several seconds before he realized that it was a friend of Zhao Liu\u2019s. However, Zhao Liu and this woman had had no contact for a long time, so he didn\u2019t recognize her for a while.\u201cJinge!\u201d When the woman saw Zhao Jinge, she immediately walked towards him with a smile on her face. \u201cJinge, long time no see!\u201d\u201cAunt Li,\u201d Zhao Jinge greeted the woman. The woman\u2019s name was Li Xiu. She was from the nearby Lijia village and married in Qiaotou Village where Zhao Liu\u2019s family lives.Before Zhao Liu married, she had a good relationship with this woman surnamed Li. After her marriage, she still kept in contact with her. Later, the reason for cutting off contact was because the woman surnamed Li told Zhao Jinge about a marriage alliance.It was her who told Zhao Jinge\u2019s mother that her neighbor had a son two years older than Zhao Jinge, whose name was Li Zugen.Just by this name, one could imagine how precious this Li Zugen was at home . . . and the reason why he was treasured was because three generations of the Li family would be passed to him alone. But Li Zugen\u2019s body has never been very good, and he was very thin.The Li family had a very ordinary condition. Li Zugen\u2019s health was never good, and the Li family wanted to arrange for him an early marriage, and it would be better to have a strong ger who could help with the family work in the future.When Zhao Jinge was a child, he was very strong and lovely. Once Zhao Liu took him to Lijia Village to see a play, and Li Liushi, Li Zugen\u2019s mother, was attracted to him. She was also a person from Qiaotou Village. After she returned home and inquired about Zhao Fugui\u2019s and Zhao Liu\u2019s situation, she was even more satisfied with Zhao Jinge. Then she asked Li Xiu to help her with the matchmaking.The Li family came to the Zhao family several times and showed great sincerity. Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu looked at Li Zugen and found that, although he was a little skinny, there was nothing wrong with him, so they agreed.Their family\u2019s ger was a little too strong, so they were afraid that he won\u2019t be able to marry well in the future. Although the Li family had little money, Li Zugen had no brothers, so there was no need to divide the family lands in the future. The Li family\u2019s son was also thin and small, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to beat their own son.The marriage between the Li family and the Zhao family was settled. Zhao Jinge had a fianc\u00e9, but that fianc\u00e9, who was shorter than him, didn\u2019t like him very much.Of course, Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t know what he liked or didn\u2019t like at that time, but he felt a bit lost occasionally.Later, when Zhao Jinge\u2019s situation changed when he turned twelve\u2014his older brother died and his mother got seriously ill\u2014the Li family withdrew from the marriage arrangement.They didn\u2019t want to bear the burden of the Zhao family, and the 14-year-old Li Zugen fell in love with a girl his age age in Lijia Village as well. The girl was the child left by a married ger in Lijia Village. The ger died early, and his husband\u2019s family didn\u2019t want to support the girl even though she was a step-child, so they threw her to her grandma\u2019s house.This girl\u2019s life in her grandma\u2019s house was very bad. Li Zugen often helped her by giving her things, so she fell in love with Li Zugen and was willing to marry him.After annulling his engagement, Zhao Jing no longer cared about the affairs of the Li family. At first, someone would mention Li Zugen in front of him with ulterior motives. But later, probably because he was pitiful for not being able to get married, no one mentioned it in front of him again.Because of this, Li Xiu and Zhao Liu, who were really good friends, ended up in a quarrel for Zhao Jinge\u2019s sake. Then she felt ashamed to face Zhao Liu and stopped coming to the house of the Zhao family.Because of the bad relationship between Zhao Liu and her maternal family, they hardly went back these years, so both sides seldom saw each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I am telling you that the Li family have suffered retribution!\u201d Li Xiu said to Zhao Jinge.She came to see Zhao Jinge because of the misfortune that happened to Li Zugen\u2019s family. Her heart felt so happy that she wanted to share her happiness with Zhao Jinge.\u201cAt that time Li Zugen wanted to marry that bitch surnamed Xu . . . but now . . . Ha ha!\u201d Li Xiu kept talking.It turned out that after Li Zugen annulled his engagement to Zhao Jinge, he got immediately engaged to the Xu girl from his village. At the age of 17, the two of them got married.They had a good life at first, and the Xu girl gave birth to four sons to Li Zugen, so the Li family was very kind to her and didn\u2019t let her do any work.But nowadays, four sons were not easy to feed.The Li family didn\u2019t have much money. Li Zugen and his father were still very skinny. They couldn\u2019t work for others to make money, but could only plant their own land. So the life of the family was getting poorer and poorer, and they even had to borrow money for living expenses.Later, they couldn\u2019t help it and asked the Xu girl to go to their landlord\u2019s house and help him with some work.In addition to having land, the landlord\u2019s family also engaged in the cocoon business. Several villages around them had silkworms and cocoons, which were all sold to their house. They were very rich and their house was built of green bricks and tiles, which were magnificent, but they had no children.The Xu girl was very capable of giving birth to a son. Who would not have noticed? The landlord\u2019s wife was still very young and powerful. She didn\u2019t want to have a young and beautiful girl to come home and seduce her husband. So she agreed to bring Xu, who was around her age, and established how much money she would pay for her to have a son for the landlord.Xu agreed as Li Zugen\u2019s family already owed a lot of money at that time.In the countryside, this behavior was called concubinage \u2013 spending some money to rent a woman to give birth to their own children. When the time limit was up, the woman would be sent back, and the child would stay.For a very poor family, it was nothing to ask a wife to become a concubine for several years. Anyway, she would come back to live with them in the end. When you didn\u2019t have enough to eat, no one cared about chastity at all.It was also thanks to Xu\u2019s ability that during those three years, she already gave birth to a son. And when the three years were almost over, she had another one in her stomach.Since she became a concubine, she had enough to eat and drink. After getting pregnant with a baby, she was even able to eat meat every day. Later, when the baby was born, she would feed the baby herself, so she ate and drank even better.She never had so good a life in the Li family.Xu didn\u2019t want to leave, so she went to ask the wife of the landlord to stay.Although the wife was not very beautiful, she was much more beautiful than Xu. She was even one or two years younger than Xu. Xu was no threat to her. After thinking about it, she agreed.In any case, Xu\u2019s children would be calling her mother in the future, and Xu\u2019s position in the family would only be a bit better than her servants\u2019. Leaving such a village woman who didn\u2019t know big words would not only not hinder her but would also show her magnanimity.In the future, when those children grow up, they will see who they should be close to, that is when they look at Xu, who was married a long time ago and had four sons outside.\u201cThen Xu took fifty silver to the Li family and broke off her relationship with them. Now Li Zugen is being ridiculed! He let his wife become a concubine, and as a result, his wife is gone.\u201d Li Xiu laughed at Li Zugen.Originally, Li Zugen\u2019s wife could make money for her own children, and some people even envied her. Now that Xu ran away, the situation was different.Even when Xu had brought back one hundred silver before, they could only buy three or four mu of land after deducting what they had already spent. Li Zugen was now dragging along with him his four sons . . . Unless he didn\u2019t buy land but spent this money to buy a women or a ger, there would be no wife to warm his bed in the future.And if there was no wife in the family, could it still be called home?\u201cIf he buys the land, he wouldn\u2019t be able to plant so much. If he uses the money to marry a new wife . . . His family is so poor. What is the use of marrying someone else? And those four sons, now they are fine, but when they grow up, wouldn\u2019t they want to get their own wives? . . . Tut-tut*! (*onomatopoeia for tongue clicking)!\u201d Li Xiuer said while gloating.Back then, if Li Zugen had married Zhao Jinge, with his ability to work, his family would have gotten better and better and there would have been no need to worry about Zhao Jinge running away.Li Xiu came to talk to Zhao Jinge about this, hoping that Zhao Jinge would be happy, but in fact, Zhao Jinge was not very happy.What did Li Zugen look like? He had already forgotten. How could he have time to mind his affairs now? But this Li Xiu had been talking by his side all the time, and he didn\u2019t know whether Jiang Zhen would come or not.Zhao Jinge listened carelessly and kept searing around with his eyes. Because he hadn\u2019t seen Jiang Zhen, his heart felt empty and he hoped that Li Xiu would leave early.Fortunately, Li Xiu finally finished her news and said, \u201cJinge, I will go to your house, so you can continue working.\u201dLi Xiu finally let Zhao Jinge go. Zhao Jinge let out a sigh of relief as he looked at the sun above his head and went to the tree forest at the edge of the canal.Usually when Jiang Zhen went there, he would give him a wink outside first, but today, he didn\u2019t, and he didn\u2019t know if Jiang Zhen would come or not.Of course, Jiang Zhen came. Just as Zhao Jinge walked to the forest, he called Zhao Jinge, \u201cJinge!\u201dThe corners of Zhao Jinge\u2019s mouth immediately hooked up.Jiang Zhen had been there for a long time. He hid when he saw someone pulling Zhao Jinge for a talk. He didn\u2019t know the woman who spoke to Zhao Jinge, but he thought that she was mostly gossiping, so he didn\u2019t ask any more questions, but took out the food for Zhao Jinge to eat.The dish he cooked at noon today was fried cabbage with sliced bacon.It was not convenient to eat from a bamboo tube, so he brought a basket with a sea bowl filled with rice, and the cabbage fried with sliced meat covered the rice.Compared to the fish soup this morning, the fried cabbage with sliced bacon was really delicious. Zhao Jinge ate a large bowl of rice clean in a short time and thought he could eat another two bowls.But food must be saved. Zhao Jinge thought that it was already good to have such an extra bowl of rice at noon.When he had enough to eat and drink, Zhao Jinge remembered what had just happened, but he thought it had nothing to do with him. He didn\u2019t want to talk about Li Zugen in front of Jiang Zhen, so he didn\u2019t mention it to Jiang Zhen.Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t take Li Zugen seriously at all, but he didn\u2019t know that the Li family had gathered and thought about him.Li Zugen was still thinking about Xu, but Xu certainly wouldn\u2019t come back.Their family consisted of old and small people, and he was supposed to be the family pillar, but he was still thin and powerless. It was because of the silver sent by Xu that they had paid off a part of their debts, but they still needed to pay back seventy-eight silver in the future.He had worked hard for a year, but he couldn\u2019t even grow enough food for his family. In the future, he would either need to buy more land or food!They preferred the former, but who would plant the land after they buy it? Who would take care of the food and clothing of his four sons?\u201cI heard that Zhao Jinge still hasn\u2019t married . . . Ugly as he is, he has a lot of strength.\u201d\u201cAs long as he doesn\u2019t take his parents with him, our family\u2019s life would be easier after you marry him.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After Jiang Zhen fed Zhao Jinge, he went out again to wander around. He was lucky enough to see a rabbit.The grey rabbit was very alert. When he saw Jiang Zhen, he ran away quickly. Seeing this, Jiang Zhen rushed after him.Of course, he wasn\u2019t able to keep up with the rabbit, but with Jiang Zhen\u2019s eyesight, it was not difficult to follow the trail of the rabbit to find its nest.Thanks to the fact that it had been raining for a few days, the soil was very wet and soft, which made leaving footprints very easy.Jiang Zhen soon found a small hole near the ridge of the field. After that, he found another hole in the nearby mulberry field.There were three holes in the rabbit\u2019s nest. Wild rabbits usually have several holes. As long as you find every hole, it is very easy to catch them.Jiang Zhen soon blocked up all the nest holes that should be blocked. There was only one hole left for them to escape from. He started a fire near one of the holes . . .Before long, Jiang Zhen caught two rabbits that were smoked out of the nest.He took out the straw from the basket and bound the rabbits\u2019 feet. Jiang Zhen carried them to his home, but after a while, he changed his direction, indenting to give one to Zhao Jinge.He gave Zhao Jinge meat every day, but his parents never had meat to eat, so Zhao Jinge always felt guilty. This time, he had two rabbits, which he wanted to give for his mother-in-law and father-in-law to taste.When he came back to the place where Zhao Jinge was working, he winked at Zhao Jinge.Of course, Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t feel \u201cflattered\u201d from his dark face at all. He only knew that Jiang Zhen had winked at him, so they could talk in the woods.Zhao Jinge once again did what he should have never done according to his education \u2013 he went to the woods for a rendezvous.\u201cKeep the rabbit, marinate it, and you can save it for the Spring Festival.\u201d Hearing that Jiang Zhen wanted to give him a rabbit, Zhao Jinge hurriedly refused.\u201cTake it and cook it soon,\u201d Jiang Zhen stated strongly to Zhao Jinge. \u201cYou are very busy with spring ploughing so you have to eat better. Let our father eat better too, or he will not be able to keep up with his work.\u201d\u201cI always take your things . . .\u201d Zhao Jinge was very embarrassed.\u201cAfter that, you are all mine. What\u2019s your worry?\u201d Jiang Zhen teased.Zhao Jinge was stunned and pondered about Jiang Zhen\u2019s words. Jiang Zhen said that he would be his . . . Was this giving him hope that he would marry him in the future?When he first started to keep in contact with Jiang Zhen, Zhao Jinge had the idea of letting Jiang Zhen marry into his house. After all, Jiang Zhen had nothing at that time, and he had saved Jiang Zhen\u2019s life before, but these days . . .These days, Jiang Zhen brought him food every day, even meat. He had gained benefits that Jiang Zhen obtained with his abilities, and he couldn\u2019t say what he originally wanted to say.Moreover, his parents were not necessarily looking for someone for him to marry in someone else\u2019s home.If his family had a lot of money, his parents would be reluctant to give their family property to others, but now, they were so poor. If he got married, his parents would certainly be willing to do so. Even if he got married, he would bring his parents with him in order to support them.Having figured out that Jiang Zhen was so kind to him, because he didn\u2019t want to be a nuisance, Zhao Jinge was more relaxed. He accepted Jiang Zhen\u2019s rabbit and didn\u2019t feel that there was anything strange about that.In the future, they could avoid the bride price, so Jiang Zhen wouldn\u2019t lose too much. And he could support his parents by working hard.Jiang Zhen was very happy to see Zhao Jinge accept his rabbit, but he didn\u2019t know that Zhao Jinge was thinking about so many things.As a matter of fact, he really didn\u2019t think too much about whether to marry or not. In modern times, he had no relatives or reasons to marry. Here, he didn\u2019t treat the Jiang family as his relatives, so he didn\u2019t care about marriage.As a matter of fact, his requirements were very low. It would already be nice to have someone to warm his bed.After he gave the rabbit to Zhao Jinge, Jiang Zhen took the remaining rabbit back. Then he saw Wang Haisheng\u2019s boat stop by the river nearby.Wang Haisheng\u2019s two children were sitting at the bow and looking around. Seeing Jiang Zhen, they quickly ran to the cabin. After a while, Wang Haisheng also came out. \u201cJiang . . . Mister Jiang.\u201d He didn\u2019t know what to call Jiang Zhen, so he called him by the most honorable name in his opinion.\u201cJust call me Jiang Zhen,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. \u201cAre you back?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m back. The doctor said to take the medicine and boil it,\u201d Wang Haisheng said.After hearing that, Jiang Zhen remembered that there was no such thing as hospitalization in these times. The doctor would not leave the patient in the pharmacy at all. Before, Sun Xiaoshan\u2019s stay in the pharmacy for one night was because of Yang Jing.Jiang Zhen was very rude to the Jiang family before, but in general, as long as no one bothered him, he was actually very easy to get along with. He asked, \u201cIs everything alright?\u201d\u201cThe doctor said that after taking the medicine and taking good care of him, he should get better.\u201d Wang Haisheng was happy. After taking the medicine yesterday, Sun Xiaoshan looked much better, and now, he could even talk to him.His wife, who he thought would die, was fine now. He was so happy that he could barely hide the smile on his face.Jiang Zhen frowned as he glanced at the dirty boat. \u201cI have an empty house. You can take your wife there to recuperate. Sick people can\u2019t live well on this boat and they need to be in a clean place.\u201d Back then, Jiang Zhen had asked the Jiang family to build two houses. He lived by himself in one of them, while the other one was still vacant.In fact, he didn\u2019t like people living in his home. But if Sun Xiaoshan really lived on the boat, he wouldn\u2019t be able to get better.In addition, the boat needed to be renovated.Wang Haisheng\u2019s boat was much bigger than the one often used by the village head\u2019s family to rent to the villagers to get married into, but it was old nevertheless. Maybe it was because it had been raining these days, that the boat smelled moldy, which Jiang Zhen found a bit unbearable.No matter what business he would be doing in the future, he would need to rely on this ship to transport goods for a long time. In that case, he didn\u2019t want this ship to be too shabby.Wang Haisheng looked at Jiang Zhen with surprise and delight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

In fact, he had always thought of earning money to buy a piece of land on the shore and settle down.But how could it be that simple?Not to mention that he couldn\u2019t save enough money, even if he did, the vast majority of the villages rejected outsiders like him. The only thing he dared to think about was to marry his ger son to parents-in-law on the shore.Although Jiang Zhen only asked him to stay temporarily, Wang Haisheng was still extremely grateful.Because Sun Xiaoshan was still ill and couldn\u2019t walk, Wang Haisheng carried him on his back. Then they went in a group to Jiang Zhen\u2019s house.Along the way, they also met some villagers from Hexi Village.Wang Haisheng had lived here for a long time, so he also knew some people here. But those people came to his life quickly and were very indifferent to him. Because of this, he was worried that after following Jiang Zhen back, someone would come and tell Jiang Zhen to drive him away.As a result . . .Wang Haisheng looked around blankly and couldn\u2019t understand why the villagers in Hexi Village ran away so fast when they saw them.Was he that terrible?Wang Haisheng didn\u2019t understand what was going on, and the two children near him were also very confused. The children in the village didn\u2019t like playing with them and had often bullied them before, but they were never afraid of them.\u201cJiang. . . Jiang Zhen, what on earth is going on?\u201d Wang Haisheng looked at Jiang Zhen puzzled.\u201cNothing,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Hearing that Jiang Zhen said it was nothing, Wang Haisheng was relieved. When he started to look at the people around him again, he suddenly found that these people looked at him with sympathy in their eyes.This . . . What\u2019s going on?People in Hexi Village really sympathized with Wang Haisheng. They believed that Jiang Zhen was a madman now. When they saw Wang Haisheng walking with Jiang Zhen, trembling, they even thought that he had been intimidated by Jiang Zhen, and even that Sun Xiaoshan, who was being carried by him, was beaten by Jiang Zhen.After all, this was the guy that dared to fight even with a yamen officer!Jiang Zhen put all the valuable things and food in his house. The other house was almost empty, and he asked Wang Haisheng\u2019s family to live there. Then he said, \u201cYou should clean up your house first before living there. You should also start a fire yourself. Don\u2019t come in my house.\u201d\u201cYes, yes.\u201d Wang Haisheng nodded repeatedly as he looked at the mud house, which was actually very simple.Wang Haisheng had some useful things on his boat but not too many. After going back several times, he brought them all in and soon settled down. By that time, it was almost dark.Seeing that it was almost time for Zhao Jinge to return home, Jiang Zhen simply tidied himself up and went to the intersection to sit down and wait for Zhao Jinge.As a result, it was Zhao Fugui, Zhao Jinge\u2019s father, who came back first.It had been raining in the past few days. Zhao Fugui, who was working outside as a short-time worker, didn\u2019t go back home. When he came back today, he had been walking with his head lowered, but when he saw Jiang Zhen sitting on the side of the road, he was startled and quickened his pace.Jiang Zhen touched his nose and continued waiting.Later, it was Zhao Jinge\u2019s turn. He was carrying a rabbit in his hand. When he saw Jiang Zhen, he first paused, then lowered his head to avoid Jiang Zhen\u2019s eyes and accelerated his steps like his father.After a while, Zhao Jinge returned home.\u201cWhere did you get the rabbit from?\u201d Zhao Liu immediately asked in surprise when she saw the rabbit in Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand.\u201cCaught it in the field.\u201d Zhao Jinge bowed his head awkwardly. Although he did a good job in farming, he was not good at catching things. In fact, he couldn\u2019t catch rabbits at all . . .However, Zhao Liu didn\u2019t doubt it. She always thought her son was the best. In this case, it was normal to her that her son was able to catch a rabbit.\u201cThere are many good things at home recently. I\u2019m very happy!\u201d Zhao Liu said with a smile, looking at the five ducklings at her feet and the rabbit in his hand, and then talked about Li Zugen\u2019s family. \u201cToday Xiu came and told me about the Li family. Their family suffered retribution from annulling the engagement. What happened? Their daughter-in-law is gone!\u201cZhao Liu soon told the story of Li Zugen\u2019s family and criticized them.Zhao Fugui had been listening silently, not expressing his own opinions but still nodding from time to time.Zhao Liu was very excited when she talked about it, but when she finished, she got depressed again.Although Li Zugen\u2019s wife ran away with another person, she also had four sons. No matter how poor their days were now, someone would support them in old age. What about her family\u2019s Jinge?Now there are the two of them. Jinge was at least surrounded by some help. What when we are gone one day?Jinge didn\u2019t even have a child, and when he got old, there would be no one to take care of him. This . . .Zhao Liu stopped talking, and Zhao Fugui was even more silent. At the beginning, he still wanted to find a husband for Zhao Jinge, but he gave up on this idea two years ago. He just wanted to find a mother-in-law for Zhao Jinge to let him have a family.But their family was too poor, and there were even two old drags, so no one was willing to marry Zhao Jinge at all.\u201cDon\u2019t worry about me, Mom, Dad,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. He wanted to tell them about himself and Jiang Zhen, but his words wouldn\u2019t come out.Jiang Zhen had offended many people. If his parents knew about them, they would be even more worried.Fearing that his son would be sad, Zhao Liu didn\u2019t talk about this any longer but mentioned something else. \u201cMy Jinge will be fine. There\u2019s nothing to worry about. But when I look at Jiang Zhen, I feel very scared. Fugui, you don\u2019t know this, but he is always staring at our house. I got up in the middle of the night last night and saw him hanging around our house!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhao Fugui was surprised. Zhao Jinge\u2019s heart also skipped.Zhao Fugui\u2019s brows wrinkled tightly. \u201cHe was hanging around our house at night? He isn\u2019t thinking about robbing our house, is he?\u201d\u201cRobbing?\u201d Zhao Liu was also frightened. \u201cWhat are we going to do? Our Jinge can\u2019t beat him!\u201c\u201cMother, he wouldn\u2019t. I saved his life. And . . . there is nothing worth robbing in our house,\u201d Zhao Jinge said, his eyes looking at the rabbit. Jiang Zhen wouldn\u2019t rob their house; the rabbit was sent by Jiang Zhen.And . . . Jiang Zhen had come to see him last night?He actually fell asleep without knowing it . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

When there was no longer any movement from his parents, he got up secretly and went to Jiang Zhen\u2019s place.He has been to Jiang Zhen\u2019s house several times in the evening, which was not strange, but today, after approaching it, Zhao Jinge unexpectedly heard a voice that didn\u2019t belong to Jiang Zhen.Is there someone else in Jiang Zhen\u2019s house?After Zhao Jinge came home today, he was too embarrassed to look at Jiang Zhen because his parents were nearby. He didn\u2019t know about Wang Haisheng\u2019s family moving in. At this moment, he was a bit confused. Standing there stunned, he didn\u2019t know what to do.In the village, he was always rejected by the others. There was no uglier ger or woman in their whole village. Since his engagement got annulled in his teens, the others always looked at him with eyes full of sympathy.People like him must be unlikable. Jiang Zhen . . . was he bored with him?Zhao Jinge felt butterflies in his stomach and was very uneasy, while Jiang Zhen was really a bit annoyed at that moment.The mud walls in the countryside were thick and soundproof, but the doors and windows in the countryside were not soundproof, so even if there was a small movement next door, he could hear everything.Although Wang Haisheng tried to keep his voice as low as possible when he took care of Sun Xiaoshan, he had good ears and could hear everything. Because the voice was low, he subconsciously listened to it and could fall asleep even harder\u2026Someone was whispering over there, which was definitely more annoying than the meaningless chirping of cicadas and frogs!Jiang Zhen was willing to help others as much as he could. The education he received in modern times made it difficult for him not to starve to death. So before crossing here, he accidentally received a new life by saving others. But he was still very unhappy because it was too noisy to sleep at the moment.Hurry up tomorrow! He must quickly build a house for Wang Haisheng and let him move out!Unable to sleep, Jiang Zhen simply left the house and went to Zhao Jinge. Although Zhao Jinge has usually fallen asleep by this time, he might not have slept yet, right?Jiang Zhen quietly went out of his house. Just as he walked a few steps out, he saw Zhao Jinge standing there motionless.\u201cJinge?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at him with a bit of surprise. \u201cYou\u2019ve come to me?\u201dZhao Jinge stood there, hesitating as to whether he should take a look, when he saw Jiang Zhen come out. He was overjoyed for a moment. \u201cJiang Zhen!\u201dZhao Jinge seldom called Jiang Zhen\u2019s name directly, so it made Jiang Zhen\u2019s heart itch. He went forward and kissed Zhao Jinge\u2019s face directly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you go to bed early but came to see me so late?\u201dZhao Jinge took a deep breath to try and calm down his heart from the joy of seeing Jiang Zhen. \u201cMy mother said she saw you last night . . . You came to see me last night? I didn\u2019t even know.\u201d When he finished speaking, he felt a bit upset.\u201cWeren\u2019t you asleep? Unlike me you work so hard every day. You should sleep more,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. He especially liked people like Zhao Jinge. He was a bit shy, but he would also express his feelings clearly when he should and would reciprocate the feelings he has received.Zhao Jinge was happy to hear that Jiang Zhen cared about him and felt guilty about his misunderstanding of Jiang Zhen. After thinking about it, he simply asked, \u201cYou . . . how come there seems to be someone else living there?\u201c\u201cI\u2019ve lent the empty house to someone else,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. It was too dark, and he couldn\u2019t see Zhao Jinge\u2019s expression clearly, but he could still hear something strange in Zhao Jinge\u2019s voice. \u201cBecause someone is here, you didn\u2019t want to come inside and just stood here?\u201d\u201cWell . . .\u201d Zhao Jinge responded.\u201cIt\u2019s really annoying to let them live here. I will make them move out soon,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. \u201cThere has been a lot of noise over there today, and I couldn\u2019t sleep.\u201d\u201cThen what?\u201d Zhao Jinge frowned. \u201cCan\u2019t they be quiet?\u201d\u201cThere is an ill person there, so they can\u2019t be quiet,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, dragging Zhao Jinge to the secret place nearby. Then he told him about Wang Haisheng\u2019s family.Zhao Jinge had also experienced illness in his family with no money for medical treatment. He felt guilty about his previous thoughts, and was now more certain that Jiang Zhen was a good man.\u201cThe ill person wanted to be quiet . . . But you can\u2019t sleep well\u2014\u201d Zhao Jinge was about to ask Jiang Zhen if he could sleep on the boat or not, when Jiang Zhen suddenly interrupted him.\u201cJinge, in fact, there is a solution,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, and then told Zhao Jinge about spending twenty silver. Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t care about it, which surprised him a little and improved his mood for the better.When he was so happy, he couldn\u2019t help trying to tease Zhao Jinge.\u201cHow come?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked.\u201cI\u2019ll sleep in your room. I\u2019ll climb through the window and leave early tomorrow. I won\u2019t let anyone know.\u201d Jiang Zhen laughed.Zhao Jinge was confused again. At this time, he should push away Jiang Zhen who was standing very close to him. But somehow, he did not do it. He even considered the feasibility of letting Jiang Zhen sleep with him.\u201cAlright. I won\u2019t tease you anymore.\u201d Jiang Zhen kissed Zhao Jinge on the cheek again. Isn\u2019t it just a little noise? It\u2019s not that I can\u2019t sleep.\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s OK,\u201d Zhao Jinge suddenly said, clenching his teeth.This time, it was Jiang Zhen who was startled by him. \u201cJinge?\u201d\u201cYou can sleep on the bed, and I\u2019ll sleep on the bamboo couch. There is a bamboo couch in my room,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. The so-called bamboo couch was a bed made entirely of bamboo. It was three or four feet wide. It was very cool to sleep on it. People here liked to sleep on a bamboo couch in summer.The bamboo bed in his house was bought by his father when he and his brother were young. In the summer, they would move the bamboo bed outside the house for half a night after dinner, and then go inside the house after midnight.Sometimes, when he and his brother fell asleep there, his father would not even wake them up. His parents would move the bamboo couch inside the house and let them continue to sleep in the house.Later, his brother was gone, and his family was not in the mood to enjoy the coolness outside every day. The bamboo couch was put in his room, usually used to put things on.After Zhao Jinge said those words, his hands trembled uncontrollably. Only after a while did he calm down again.Jiang Zhen was the best person to him besides his parents and brother. He was also the first and only man to express his affection for him. He had actually already made up his mind to follow Jiang Zhen since then. That being the case, it was nothing.Jiang Zhen was both surprised and delighted.Zhao Jinge had always been very conservative, and he was aware of it, so it was enough to kiss occasionally. Although he already said that he would climb the window, he didn\u2019t really mean to do that.Jiang Zhen always knew the right thing to do. As a result, Zhao Jinge was willing to sleep with him.\u201cJinge, you must like me very much.\u201d Jiang Zhen held Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand. He knew that Zhao Jinge should like him very much, but at that moment, he became aware of it once again.Zhao Jinge froze up again when he heard Jiang Zhen say \u201clike\u201d. He really liked Jiang Zhen and wanted to hold on to him. He had never had such emotions before, and they had never been stronger than at this moment.\u201cI like you too.\u201d Jiang Zhen kissed Zhao Jinge again. He would never lose Zhao Jinge in his life.Zhao Jinge\u2019s heart jumped, and his face became hot again. \u201cI\u2019m so ugly . . .\u201d\u201cWhere are you ugly?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked. \u201cI think you look great.\u201dZhao Jinge only felt that Jiang Zhen was lying to him with his eyes wide open, but he was still very happy, which made Jiang Zhen also very happy. In the end, both men stood silently in the dark for a long time.Finally, Jiang Zhen said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to go to bed.\u201d He was an adult man who had lived for 30 years, yet he was as stupid as those little boys when he fell in love . . . He despised himself a little.\u201cUm.\u201d Zhao Jinge nodded and headed for his house. He and Jiang Zhen were still holding hands as Jiang Zhen followed him back.He should be afraid of his parents bumping into him, but for some reason, Zhao Jinge was not afraid at all but felt even a little eager. Unfortunately, Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu slept very well and didn\u2019t get up at all.When Zhao Jinge had gone out, he had left the door open. He entered his house as Jiang Zhen followed him. Then, Zhao Jinge became stiff again.\u201cSleep. I won\u2019t touch you.\u201d Jiang Zhen touched Zhao Jinge\u2019s head.Zhao Jinge was twenty-five. He himself was twenty-six. If it was in modern times, he would definitely break his word now. It was not a big deal for two people to roll between the sheets. But it\u2019s in ancient times, it was better to put up with it for now.I\u2019ve endured it for so many years, and it\u2019s not that long any more.Zhao Jinge\u2019s brain was still a bit muddled at the moment, so he really went to bed like he was.Jiang Zhen noticed this, and found it a kind of funny. He closed the door and the window first and then lay down beside Zhao Jinge. He took Zhao Jinge\u2019s quilt cover and slept with him under the same quilt.Although he can\u2019t do anything, he really doesn\u2019t want to leave at this moment.Zhao Jinge\u2019s room was clean and smelled good. He and Zhao Jinge lay on the bed side by side, and Jiang Zhen had a reaction almost immediately, but he didn\u2019t do anything except hold Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand. He didn\u2019t even relieve himself.A man should endure when he should. If their wife wanted to do it, as soon as she lay next to them, sooner or later, perseverance would become useless.Jiang Zhen admonished himself and began to rejoice that the aesthetic standards of the people from that time were all different from his own.Zhao Jinge was really too gullible. If someone with the same aesthetic value as him had taken a fancy to Zhao Jinge early on, Zhao Jinge would have been deceived by this person long ago, and he wouldn\u2019t have had a chance at all. Now, of course, he didn\u2019t have to worry about that.Jiang Zhen felt that Zhao Jinge was very persistent in some aspects. Since he had chosen him, he would not be with others in the future.As long as Zhao Jinge was consistent, he would never do anything to betray him.Jiang Zhen thought about it a lot. When he came to his senses, he found that Zhao Jinge had already fallen asleep and his breathing was very stable.Should he be better than an animal now or should he be worse than an animal?With a light chuckle, Jiang Zhen took Zhao Jinge in his arms, reached inside his clothes and touched him.Zhao Jinge\u2019s body was not nice to touch because of his poor living conditions and his skin was not very smooth, but he just felt that this person was particularly comfortable to touch.There was another person beside him, but Zhao Jinge slept very well that night. When he got up in the morning, he discovered that he and Jiang Zhen were hugging each other. Apart from being a bit embarrassed, he accepted it very quickly.He had made up his mind to be with Jiang Zhen anyway, hadn\u2019t he? He didn\u2019t know when Jiang Zhen would come to propose marriage.Zhao Jinge woke up very early that morning, but at night, he was being secretly taken advantage of by the other. He was also proud to discover that Jiang Zhen, who was bigger than him, was unable to get up.\u201cI should have gotten up earlier.\u201d The sound of Zhao Jinge getting up woke Jiang Zhen, who couldn\u2019t help sighing.Last night he had promised to get up and leave secretly in the early hours of the morning, but he didn\u2019t wake up. Or he didn\u2019t want to leave until he woke up naturally.\u201cMy mother won\u2019t come to my room. You can sleep a little longer.\u201d Zhao Jinge looked just like a regular male, so Zhao Liu couldn\u2019t treat him as intimately as a daughter, let alone enter his house for no reason.\u201cUm.\u201d Jiang Zhen nodded and didn\u2019t get up from the bed; he just watched as Zhao Jinge tidied up his clothes.Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t take off his clothes when he went to bed last night. His clothes were a bit wrinkled, so he stretched out his hand and pulled at them. As a result, Jiang Zhen stared at him as if he was going to take his clothes off . . .He ran out of the house almost immediately.Jiang Zhen watched him leave and listened to the movements from outside. After confirming that Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui were in their own quarters, he quietly climbed the window and left.Although Jiang Zhen got up later than usual today, it was still only dawn. Nowadays, people went to sleep so early that they couldn\u2019t sleep until the morning.When he returned to his residence, Jiang Zhen saw that Wang Haisheng had also gotten up and was busy cooking, while his two children were helping him.\u201cYou\u2019re up!\u201d Wang Haisheng greeted Jiang Zhen. He didn\u2019t know that Jiang Zhen hadn\u2019t returned all night. He just thought that he had gone out early.Jiang Zhen nodded at him; then suddenly, he was not in a hurry to let him move out.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 42": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 36 - Ship repair and newsPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36 \u2013 Ship repair and newsSun Xiaoshan was not feeling well last night, but he felt better today and was able to sit up.These days, the nine-year-old child could do almost everything at home, so Wang Haisheng asked Wang Yuer to take care of Sun Xiaoshan and took Jiang Zhen to clean up the boat.The ship was a little dirty, but it was well cared for. It could be seen that the owner loved it very much.\u201cThis ship was newly built seven years ago when the previous one got too broken to hold on. At that time, I had some money saved, so I changed it,\u201d Wang Haisheng said when he cleaned the ship according to Jiang Zhen\u2019s requirements, then he said where the ship needed to be repaired and where more shelves could be added.\u201cCan you?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cYes. I\u2019ve been dealing with ships for a long time, so I can repair them. I have several tools,\u201d Wang Haisheng said. \u201cIf I had enough materials and a few more tools, I could build another one.\u201dWhen he was a child, he lived on a fishing boat with his parents. At that time, the boat was a bit broken in the beginning and had to be repaired from time to time. When he was looking for someone to build the boat, he watched the whole process and learned something about shipbuilding.Wang Haisheng didn\u2019t think that what he could do was amazing. After all, many people who depended on fishing for a living could repair their boats and build them. But Jiang Zhen was surprised nevertheless. He even wanted to ask Wang Haisheng why he didn\u2019t live on this, but he soon realized that in these times craftsmen were worthless.Everyone was equal, but knowledge was important. In these times, people didn\u2019t care much about craftsmen. Many people who mastered exquisite skills were classified as craftsmen, but they had no freedom at all.It was true that being a carpenter in the countryside could lead to a better life than being an ordinary farmer, but it was also limited. There were such carpenters in almost every village already and no newcomer was accepted.After learning about Wang Haisheng\u2019s skills, Jiang Zhen specially went to cut down a few trees. After repairing the boat, he made some furniture together with Wang Haisheng. Carpentry was not very difficult. If you didn\u2019t pay attention to appearance, you could easily make some stools or the like.People these days liked heavy furniture with fine carvings, but Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng had limited skills, so their furniture was very simple and ugly.It couldn\u2019t be sold for money, and some pieces of their furniture couldn\u2019t even be used, which was related to the wood they had chosen. Not all wood was suitable for furniture making. They didn\u2019t understand it at first. Fortunately, even if that wood couldn\u2019t be used as furniture, they could practice their skills and use it as firewood afterwards.Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng had been busy for more than ten days. In those ten days, it rained almost every day, but not all day long.In some places, spring rain was as expensive as oil, but here, spring rain went on and on.The days were warm and the rain abundant. Hexi Village, which was full of green even in winter, looked lusher, and the camphor trees started losing their leaves. After a year\u2019s growth, the old green leaves from the winter would fall from the trees in spring. At the same time, the new green leaves would soon cover the whole crown of the trees.For Wang Haisheng\u2019s family, it used to be a very sad time when it rained all day.Although the mud house was wet, they could at least make a fire and dry their clothes, but it was very troublesome on the boat. When the clothes and quilts were wet, they could only be used like that.Sometimes, some parts of the ship were not well cared for, and even the clothes in the wooden dresser would become moldy and rotten.In such an environment, people always got sick easily. One of Wang Haisheng\u2019s children got sick before and died. Because of this, Wang Haisheng was very grateful to Jiang Zhen, who took his family in.After finishing his job with Jiang Zhen that day, he took the bamboo baskets he stuffed with earthworms and went to the river to catch fish, intending to give the best fish to Jiang Zhen.\u201cFisherman, why are you staying with Eldest Jiang recently instead of living on the fishing boat?\u201d Carrying back a basket full of fish, Wang Haisheng was suddenly stopped.\u201cYou are asking me?\u201d Wang Haisheng looked at the man and then said, \u201cI sold the fishing boat to Jiang Zhen.\u201dThe man was talking about Eldest Jiang. Isn\u2019t that Jiang Zhen?The person who asked Wang Haisheng a question pondered for a moment before looking at Wang Haisheng with great sympathy. Did Jiang Zhen rob this man\u2019s boat?Not only did he rob this man\u2019s boat, but now, his whole family seemed to be working for Jiang Zhen. The six-year-old boy dug a basket of wild vegetables and directly gave it to Jiang Zhen.The villager who stopped Wang Haisheng didn\u2019t dare to ask any more questions, let alone speak ill about Jiang Zhen. After looking at Wang Haisheng sympathetically, he shook his head and left. However, Wang Haisheng was so confused that he didn\u2019t know what happened.If he didn\u2019t understand, he didn\u2019t understand. Wang Haisheng found Jiang Zhen and gave him the biggest fishes in his hands. Jiang Zhen received the fish and gave him rice of the same weight as the fish.Wang Haisheng didn\u2019t lack fish to eat. In fact, his whole family was tired of eating fish. But they were always short of rice so they thought it was delicious.If Wang Hai was tired of eating fish, Jiang Zhen was even more tired of eating fish at this moment.In modern times, fried, roasted, sweet and sour, spicy, or steamed, there were all kinds of seasonings and cooking methods, as well as many types of fish. If you let someone eat fish every day for a year, even people like him who were not picky would get tired of it, but the key point was that there was no such condition here at all.He hadn\u2019t seen chili at all. Because the oil extraction technology lagged behind, oil was very expensive; soy sauce was not cheaper than salt either. But even if it tasted bad, it was still necessary to eat and let Zhao Jinge eat with him.Jiang Zhen killed several fishes, choosing one to stream on the steaming rack and salted another one to make salted fish. In fact, people here were all very fond of salted fish. Unfortunately, salt was too expensive, so they usually didn\u2019t use salt for the fish. Jiang Zhen was already considered a big spender.Jiang Zhen wanted to give Zhao Jinge food, so he always started a fire separately from Wang Haisheng\u2019s family. He finished making the fish dish that night, eating the head and tail parts himself and leaving the best middle parts, then he waited for the night to come.When it got dark and Wang Haisheng\u2019s family next door had fallen asleep, Jiang Zhen took the fish with him and went to meet Zhao Jinge.He has been sleeping with Zhao Jinge these days.After he was accidentally seen by Zhao Liu, he was very careful. He used all his anti-reconnaissance skills learned from his last life so that no one found out that he stole incenses and jades every night.Of course, he didn\u2019t steal incense or jade . . . Zhao Jinge was very busy every day, and the two of them were not married yet, so it was naturally impossible for him to really do anything to Zhao Jinge.He handed the fish to Zhao Jinge through the window. When Jinge took it, he quietly entered Zhao Jinge\u2019s room. Then he took out a small piece of candle and lit it.In the candlelight, Zhao Jinge slowly started eating the fish.Zhao Jinge was actually fed up with eating fish too, but it was brought to him to eat by Jiang Zhen. No matter how tired he was or how bad it was, he would eat it clean. What\u2019s more, he\u2019s not an ungrateful person. It was clear to him that Jiang Zhen asked him to eat fish for his own good.Although he didn\u2019t get sick before, he often had sore knees and cramps. Recently, those problems had not manifested.Zhao Jinge ate fish in silence and didn\u2019t speak. Jiang Zhen looked at him quietly and didn\u2019t speak either. This was because they were afraid of being discovered by Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu, but also because . . . it was good to stay together without talking.That night, they chatted with each other under the quilt.Jiang Zhen once again made use of his strong self-control. Although he used to live with his comrades in arms, they were all straight, so he never had any ideas about them. But Zhao Jinge was different, he was the person he liked. The person he liked was lying next to him, and he didn\u2019t make any moves. That was also a kind of skill!Of course, on the surface, he didn\u2019t move. But in fact . . . God knows how often Zhao Jinge\u2019s tofu had been secretly eaten by him, and Zhao Jinge himself should also know.Maybe he didn\u2019t know the first night, but later, when Jiang Zhen moved his hands, he was clearly awake but kept pretending to be asleep.Early in the morning, Jiang Zhen left, taking the bowl he had brought with him.Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng had almost completely renovated the fishing boat. They were making wooden boxes by the river when suddenly, an acquaintance came to the riverside. He was wearing a yamen officer\u2019s clothes; it was Yang Jing.These days, it was raining all the time, and there was nothing to do in the yamen. Yang Jing was tired of staying at home. He couldn\u2019t help but want to go to the gambling house to play. However, a few days ago Jiang Zhen asked him about a couple of things which scared him. He was not in the mood to go out drinking and gambling with the others.But it was so boring and there was nothing to do. In the end, Yang Jing simply ran to the dock in the rain and messed around with Jiang Chenxiang while helping Jiang Zhen inquire about the seafood business at the same time. Now that the Jiangs\u2019 third son had enough trouble and he also learned what Jiang Zhen asked him to inquire about, he came to Hexi Village.Yang Jing\u2019s previous experience in Hexi Village had cast a psychological shadow on him. He didn\u2019t want to come to the village and be seen. Therefore, when he saw Jiang Zhen staying by the river, Yang Jing immediately displayed his joy.\u201cBoss!\u201d Yang Jing greeted Jiang Zhen.\u201cAny news?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cI have news, boss. Those who go to the seaside to buy seafood from town will leave tomorrow. They are also willing to take you with them. If you want to go, you can go to the west of the dock early tomorrow morning to meet them,\u201d said Yang Jing.Jiang Zhen nodded and asked for some details while Yang Jing carefully told him everything he knew and then said, \u201cPeople living by the seaside like grain very much. If you have some good grain, you can sell it at a good price.\u201dYang Jing spoke a lot, then he finally said, \u201cBoss, I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cIt is about Jiang Chenxiang. He lost his job.\u201d Yang Jing giggled twice.No one knew how many people were craving for Jiang Chengxian\u2019s job. It was not easy for him to keep this job like before.Although Yang Jing was a yamen officer, it was impossible for him to find fault in a big way. He simply contacted a person who wanted Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s job and helped that person a little . . .That man was capable and had an uncle who worked as a steward at the dock and who also helped him squeeze Jiang Chengxiang out. After getting Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s job yesterday, he also gave Yang Jing two silver as a thank-you gift.Yang Jing was very proud of it but, at the same time, he looked at Jiang Zhen carefully, afraid of making Jiang Zhen angry.However, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t get angry and just smiled. \u201cThere are so many fields in the Jiang family. Butcher Jiang and Chengwen can\u2019t possibly plant them themselves. He should come back home to help.\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s right.\u201d Yang Jing nodded repeatedly, finally breathing a sigh of relief.After talking with Jiang Zhen for a while, Yang Jing left. Jiang Zhen was thinking about the next day. He went home with Wang Haisheng while making a special detour to the Jiang family house.When they arrived near the Jiang house, Jiang Zhen really saw Jiang Chengxiang, who Yang Jing mentioned to him not too long ago.Jiang Chengxiang always dressed elegantly and combed his hair meticulously, but now, he looked a bit messy.Jiang Chengxiang was having a hard time these days.After Jiang Zhen released Yang Jing, he thought his life could gradually return to normal, but the facts proved that he was thinking too much.He encountered a lot of troubles, such as Zhu Shufen\u2019s unwillingness to return home with him or someone always picking on him at the dock.He still liked Zhu Shufen very much, and even more Zhu Shufen\u2019s family situation\u2014Zhu Shufen\u2019s father had great chances of being admitted for the test!Because of this, he went to the Zhu family house several times in the past few days, apologizing and apologizing again.Zhu Shufen was already married to him, and although the Zhu family were not satisfied with him taking the money from Zhu Shufen\u2019s box, it was impossible for them to take Zhu Shufen back or for Zhu Shufen to leave him.As a result . . . just after Zhu Shufen returned, his job was gone!He used to earn two silver a month at the dock, so he could live comfortably in the county town. But now, he had lost his job and all of his previous savings had been lost to Jiang Zhen.In the end Jiang Chengxiang could only bring Zhu Shufen back to Hexi Village. Otherwise, they might not even be able to eat.Now, Jiang Chengxiang, who had just returned, saw Jiang Zhen who had harmed him at a glance.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Yang Jing was aiming at him. If Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s eyes could carry poison, Jiang Zhen would already be poisoned.Although he didn\u2019t have the talent and financial resources to take the examination, he was always proudly thinking of himself as a scholar and felt that he could change his destiny and never work in the fields in his life. But now? He lost his job and then. . .\u201cChengxiang, pack up and go to the fields with me.\u201d Butcher Jiang came out of the house with a bamboo basket and a hoe on his back, speaking as he walked.When Jiang Zhen left home, he stabbed him in the leg with a bamboo pole. Although the injury didn\u2019t kill him, it made him ill and unable to sleep for a few days. His well-being had been poor these days, and he couldn\u2019t do the work in the fields.Originally, it was nothing. In the past, when he was busy farming or had the same old lower back pain problem, his farm work had never been delayed. After all, his eldest brother was better than a long-term worker.Even if they hired a long-term worker, they couldn\u2019t ask him to work for them at night. But they could let Eldest Jiang work until night.But now, his family\u2019s eldest son had run away.Butcher Jiang was old and weak. It was understandable that he worked slowly. However, Jiang Chengwen, who was in his early twenties, which was considered the most powerful age for a man, actually worked even more slowly than the old Butcher Jiang!Butcher Jiang naturally wanted to scold him, but he hadn\u2019t even started when he simply hid in the house and refused to go out!In the past, when Eldest Jiang was too tired and got up late, old lady Jiang would tell the whole village that he was lazy and how bad he was. But when it came to Jiang Chengwen, when he cried out that he was tired, old lady Jiang was reluctant to let him work in the field.In the end, old lady Jiang went with Butcher Jiang to the field. Not only that, when others came to ask her why Jiang Chengwen didn\u2019t come to work, she also kept on speaking for Jiang Chengwen, repeatedly saying that Jiang Chengwen was too ill to come to work in the fields.Whether the others believed it or not, it was certain that the Jiang family\u2019s land would not be fully planted.It was precisely because of this that Butcher Jiang called Jiang Chengxiang to work in the fields when he just came back.Jiang Chengwen was always lazy and slippery but had thick skin. He couldn\u2019t be easily asked to work. The butcher was used to it, but Jiang Chengxiang . . . In Butcher Jiang\u2019s eyes, his third son was obedient and filial and was definitely willing to help share the work.Jiang Chengxiang had always behaved well in front of outsiders and his parents. He didn\u2019t shirk his responsibility for any work at home. But in his heart, he was unwilling to do farm work. He didn\u2019t want to become a man like Eldest Jiang!Therefore, after Butcher Jiang opened his mouth, Jiang Chengxiang didn\u2019t answer but stared at Jiang Zhen not far away.When the butcher saw Jiang Zhen, his face darkened immediately.\u201cButcher Jiang, you have two good sons that are unwilling to work in the fields.\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at Butcher Jiang and said softly, \u201cNow that you are still working, you can support them. But I\u2019m afraid their life will be sad in the future.\u201dThe ancient times were not the modern times where there were machines, chemical fertilizers, and all kinds of pesticides. These days, farmers had to plow and harvest the fields themselves. The fertilizer in the fields had to be made and used by them. When there were too many weeds, they had to pull them out. When there were worms, they had to catch them with their own hands . . .The land here was fertile and the climate was good. The crops grew fast, but the weeds grew even faster, and there were many insects. Didn\u2019t the people from this village have to go to the fields every day?But Jiang Chengwen and Chengxiang . . . These two masters were unwilling to take off their shoes to go to the paddy field! Especially Jiang Chengxiang, who accidentally saw leeches crawling on his thighs. He couldn\u2019t even eat due to nausea . . . And don\u2019t think about what he usually ate and drank. Someone needed to work hard to grow it.Butcher Jiang\u2019s face was black.\u201cThey are your only two sons . . . I think you have a bleak future,\u201d Jiang Zhen said very sincerely. He was telling the truth, but it was clear that others considered it a curse.\u201cWhat nonsense are you talking about, you knife killer? I would be miserable in the future with you being at home. Without you, I\u2019ll naturally be able to live a good life!\u201d Old madam Jiang came out with a frame on her back. She just heard Jiang Zhen\u2019s words and couldn\u2019t help scolding him.After scolding Jiang Zhen for so many years, it had become a habit. Although she had been dealt with several times by Jiang Zhen, she still couldn\u2019t learn.When Jiang Zhen heard this, he took a handful of wet mud from the side of the road and threw it at her without hesitation.He had a very good aim. What was supposed to land on Jiang Chengxiang to disgust him, landed on his face, scaring old lady Jiang.\u201cButcher Jiang, I\u2019m telling you for your own sake. Your two sons, you\u2019d better take good care of them. Don\u2019t let him become an old man who couldn\u2019t keep his family\u2019s business,\u201d Jiang Zhen earnestly warned the butcher again, and then left.When Jiang Zhen went to the river to wash his hands, Wang Haisheng defended him, saying, \u201cThat family is really hateful. They even scold you when you were just passing by! You should beat them up!\u201d\u201cAfter all, I was born to them, so it\u2019s not easy to fight them,\u201d said Jiang Zhen.Wang Haisheng was surprised. Thinking about the previous situation, he thought about Sun Xiaoshan\u2019s experience. \u201cThat old woman is your stepmother?\u201d In his opinion, Jiang Zhen was probably treated badly by his stepmother.\u201cNo, mother,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. \u201cBut people think that I beat her, and so they want to kill me . . . She always felt that she had already been very kind to me, if she didn\u2019t drown me in the toilet.\u201dWang Haisheng sighed. He had met many ruthless people before, many of whom threw their children in the river because they didn\u2019t have money to support them. But he couldn\u2019t understand such a behavior, and now he sympathized with Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen was a good man and shouldn\u2019t be treated like that by his own parents . . .In fact, Jiang Zhen also sympathized with Eldest Jiang. At that moment, he could only wish him a good family in his next life.When he got back home, Jiang Zhen took out all the money he owned.Because he gave Wang Haisheng twenty silver, what he could use as his starting capital was only ten silver, which was a bit too little . . . After thinking about it, Jiang Zhen specially packed 200 kilos of millet and planned to go to the seaside the next day to exchange it for other goods.It was already evening. After the busy work, Jiang Zhen made a meal. He steamed the salted fish with a bowl of garlic to fill his stomach and then waited for the night to fall.He would leave early the next day, so he would certainly not be able to sleep in Zhao Jinge\u2019s place tonight, but he had to tell Zhao Jinge about going out.With half a fish in hand, Jiang Zhen entered Zhao Jinge\u2019s room and kissed his face. \u201cJinge, I have something to tell you.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked in a low voice.\u201cI\u2019m going on a trip,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, then he explained that he was going to buy seafood. As a matter of fact, the seaside was not far from the village. He would set off early tomorrow morning, and in the afternoon, he should arrive at the coast. But he would be delayed for a day or two there, as he planned to find a place to sell the goods after he buys them, so it would take him at least four or five days.\u201cYou should find something to do. It\u2019s good to sell seafood,\u201d Zhao Jinge nodded. He always thought it\u2019s not good for Jiang Zhen to do nothing every day. Now that Jiang Zhen was willing to find a job, it couldn\u2019t be better.\u201cI can\u2019t bring you any food these days. So take some from home and don\u2019t go hungry.\u201d Jiang Zhen kissed Zhao Jinge\u2019s cheek again and held his hand.\u201cI didn\u2019t eat before, and everything was alright,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cBut I don\u2019t want you to be hungry,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.In fact, Jiang Zhen was not one of those people who could speak words of love very well, but Zhao Jinge had never heard such words either. So no matter what Jiang Zhen said, his reaction was always particularly strong.At this moment, he was very happy.Zhao Jinge had never been anywhere far. He didn\u2019t know anything about selling seafood, but he knew that it would cost a lot of money to live outside. After thinking about it, he took a small cloth bag from the head of his bed and gave it to Jiang Zhen. \u201cI only have four silver. Take it.\u201dMost of Zhao Jinge\u2019s money for long-term work was given to his parents, but Zhao Liu still gave him some money for buying and making clothes and buying some things for himself. He never spent that money but saved it all, a total of four silver.The money was not much, not even a little, but it was all Zhao Jinge had.Jiang Zhen took the money in his hands and felt warm in his heart. After a while, he said, \u201cYou are stupid.\u201dZhao Jinge frowned and looked at Jiang Zhen. He didn\u2019t understand why Jiang Zhen said he was stupid. As a result, Jiang Zhen kissed him again. \u201cBut I like you like this.\u201dZhao Jinge\u2019s face turned red again when he heard the word \u201clike\u201d.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t stay that night, and when he left, he took the silver given to him by Zhao Jinge.Before dawn the next day, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng set out. Before leaving, Jiang Zhen locked his house and gave his chicken to Sun Xiaoshan to take care of.Over the past few days, Sun Xiaoshan had almost recovered from his illness, but Jiang Zhen had not spoken even a few words to him. It was true that the ger was too introverted and timid, but although he was a little introverted and timid, he was still very nice. Before long he instructed his eldest son to plow all the fields near Jiang Zhen\u2019s residence to help Jiang Zhen grow vegetables and would take the children to dig wild vegetables and give them to Jiang Zhen.Of course, he did all of this while Jiang Zhen was not at home. When Jiang Zhen was at home, he basically hid inside the house. He rarely met Jiang Zhen face to face, and he didn\u2019t speak to him.Jiang Zhen was helpless, but even if he was a bit grumpy, he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. He estimated that the ger was like this, because he used to live on a boat and didn\u2019t communicate with other people.Jiang Zhen set out very early. Just before dawn, he had arrived at the place Yang Jing mentioned.At that time, all the concerned people got up early, so when they arrived, they were already there. Jiang Zhen went up to talk with them and checked them all out at the same time.As a matter of fact, Jiang Zhen did not fully trust Yang Jing and was even prepared for Yang Jing to set him up. However, it turned out that he thought too much. He knew at a glance that these people who wanted to go at sea with him were ordinary folk who had never seen blood, and at most, they were a little sly.These days, only sly people could think of starting a business. Most people only knew how to work hard.After chatting with these people for a while, Jiang Zhen got a lot of information out of them. When he knew all that he wanted to know, he stopped talking and left Wang Haisheng to socialize with the other merchants.These people who went to the seaside to buy sea goods were not rich people, and they had only 10 or 20 silver of capital. Even their boats were not as big as Wang Haisheng\u2019s boat. Wang Haisheng felt no inferiority towards them and quickly slip into their conversations.This time, five boats set out together, and everyone sailed to the seaside together.Jiang Zhen had already learned how to row from Wang Haisheng. Now he could help Wang Haisheng to have some rest, making Wang Haisheng even more grateful for his behavior.Jiang Zhen rowed for a while. Handling the oars back to Wang Haisheng he asked, \u201cHave you ever been to Fucheng?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Wang Haisheng nodded.\u201cWhat is it like over there?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked again.Wang Haisheng began to speak slowly.Jiang Zhen suddenly asked about Fucheng for a reason. The sea merchants who went to buy goods with them would all go back to their county towns to sell their goods. The price set by everyone was the same, and everyone agreed in advance that the price could not be reduced.In fact, it was actually quite good, but it\u2019s also bound that Jiang Zhen, who was the new recruit, would have a hard time earning money and might even have goods left that cannot be sold.If they go to Fucheng . . .Jiang Zhen listened carefully to Wang Haisheng\u2019s story. Meanwhile, a matchmaker came to the Zhao family in Hexi Village.There were no matchmakers in this village, but some people liked to match people, and there were many marriages. Over time, if someone wanted to propose marriage, they would go to the matchmaker and make her negotiate in their place. If the couple got married, they would invite her to have wedding wine and give her a piece of pork weighing at least two kilos without a bone.Of course, if the family of the man had money, in addition to pork, he would usually give some money to the matchmaker.The person who came to the Zhao family this time was a woman who often served as a matchmaker in Hexi Village. Her name was He Chunxiang.Zhao Liu had also dealt with this matchmaker before, hoping she could arrange a good marriage for Zhao Jinge, but Zhao Jinge\u2019s condition was too poor, so she had never been successful.Later, Zhao Liu gave up her original plan of finding her ger son a good marriage partner, so she hadn\u2019t seen Matchmaker He for a long time.\u201cElder Sister He, what are you doing here?\u201d Zhao Liu was surprised to see Matchmaker He. A moment later, she was even more surprised. \u201cIs someone going to propose to my Jinge?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She had never thought that someone would propose marriage to Zhao Jinge after several years of disappointment.\u201cOf course it is true,\u201d the matchmaker said.Constantly rubbing her hands, the smile on Zhao Liu\u2019s face couldn\u2019t be hidden. \u201cWho is it? What is his home situation? Does he want to marry Jinge into his house or does he want to marry into our house?\u201d When she asked the latter question, she blushed a little. She was afraid that no one would like to enter her family.Sure enough, the matchmaker quickly said, \u201cThat family wants to marry Jinge in.\u201dZhao Liu was a little lost and asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s that man like?\u201d Although she wanted to tell Zhao Jinge about the marriage, she would not talk about it if the man was too bad.\u201cThat man is two years older than Jinge, and his family\u2019s life is alright. But his first wife left behind four children . . .\u201d When the matchmaker looked at Zhao Liu, she saw that Zhao Liu frowned, so she couldn\u2019t help turning her mouth away secretly.In Zhao Jinge\u2019s case, someone who was willing to marry him should already be considered as burning high-quality incense. Zhao Fugui and his wife regarded him as a treasure. A few years ago, she told Zhao Jinge about a marriage to fill a house for a widower, but they were unexpectedly unwilling to do so.\u201cThere are four children already . . .\u201d When Zhao Liu heard this, she was not as happy as she had been at the beginning. It would not be easy for her Jinge to become a stepmother of so many children.\u201cThese children are still young. If he takes good care of them, when they grow up, they would be no different from their own,\u201d Matchmaker He said.Zhao Liu was still a little reluctant, but thinking about Zhao Jinge\u2019s situation she endured it.Good or bad . . . that guy is not old, is he?\u201cWho is it?\u201d Zhao Liu asked.\u201cIt\u2019s Li Zugen from Lijia Village. . .\u201d\u201cNo! Absolutely not this man!\u201d When Zhao Liu heard Li Zugen\u2019s name, she got angry. That guy\u2019s wife ran away, leaving a mess, and they wanted her Jinge to take it over? That was very wishful thinking!If nothing else, those four sons were not affordable for ordinary people. Four sons! Even if those four sons found a daughter-in-law who didn\u2019t want a dowry, how much would it cost to build a house, throw a banquet, and make furniture for so many people? What\u2019s more, was there a wife in this world who didn\u2019t need betrothal gifts?In addition, Zhao Liu had always hated the Li family. At the beginning, it was the Li family who asked for an engagement, but later, they were kicked out by them. If Zhao Jinge wasn\u2019t engaged to this Li Zugen, they would have chosen another family for him to make an early preparation. How could he still get married now that he was twenty-five?\u201cFor the Zhao family, Li Zugen is not bad. They have seventy or eighty silver of cash on their hands now . . .\u201d Matchmaker He persuaded.\u201cNo. Never to this man! You get out of here!\u201d Zhao Liu got even angrier.After saying that, thinking that she might have to rely on the matchmaker in the future, her face softened again. \u201cElder Sister He, I don\u2019t have a very good temper. I am sorry . . . It\u2019s just that the Li family really won\u2019t do. Even if I say yes, my family would not like them. You can help them find someone else.\u201dMatchmaker He\u2019s face also looked very bad at the moment. She looked at Zhao Liu with dissatisfaction and sneered, \u201cHow is it so easy to find someone new? Your Zhao Jinge looks just like a man. Which man do you think would want to marry someone like this? What\u2019s more, as far as his figure is concerned, it can be seen at a glance that he would have difficulties having children. What\u2019s more, he is already so old, so he may not be able to have a child at all . . .\u201dZhao Liushi got really angry right then and drove Matchmaker He out.When the matchmaker left, she was annoyed again, and the more she thought about it, the sadder she felt.A soft body, buttocks that were plump but petite, and a red cinnabar mole between the eyebrows that were still bright\u2014the gers who were similar to women, they were the ones who easily had children. But her Zhao Jinge . . . just the opposite. So what the matchmaker said last was not wrong. But it was precisely because it was not wrong, that she felt sadder and sadder.Zhao Liu has always been a sensitive person, and the more she thought about it, the sadder she felt. At last, the five ducklings kept shouting at her feet, and she regained her senses.Zhao Liu took very good care of these ducklings, so none of the five ducklings died. They all lived well and grew very fast. Now they were around Zhao Liu, and they wanted to go out to eat.In the past, Jiang Zhen would chop up small fish or fish intestines caught by Wang Haisheng and feed them every day. Even if they did not receive food from Zhao Liu, they would not be hungry, but Jiang Zhen was not here today. Without earthworms, fish, or shrimps, Zhao Liu cut lettuce leaves to feed the ducks. She also looked for Jiang Zhen.Strange, why haven\u2019t I seen Eldest Jiang today? Only the two children of the fisherman were digging earthworms to feed the chickens.Zhao Liushi had always been very fond of children. She looked at them and went out to dig earthworms with the five ducks. Her original sadness dissipated a lot. But even so, seeing Zhao Jinge come back, she couldn\u2019t help the redness filling her eyes.\u201cMother, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked bewildered.\u201cJinge . . .\u201d Zhao Liu called out. She wanted to cry, but thinking that she shouldn\u2019t make her son sad, she endured. \u201cJinge, if you are hungry, come and have something to eat.\u201dZhao Jinge was really hungry, so he didn\u2019t ask further.These days, he had a meal at noon every day. But since he hadn\u2019t had a meal at noon today, he couldn\u2019t bear it any longer. Before, he saw Jiang Zhen every day, but suddenly he couldn\u2019t see him anymore, making him miss him even more.Zhao Liu didn\u2019t say anything in front of Zhao Jinge, but when Zhao Fugui came back, she still told him about how Matchmaker He proposed marriage with Li Zugen. Of course, she concealed what the matchmaker had said about Jinge being unable to have children.Zhao Liu was angry, and Zhao Fugui was also very angry. \u201cEven if Jinge doesn\u2019t marry, he won\u2019t marry him!\u201dIn fact, there was one thing Zhao Fugui never told his family. After the Li family annulled the engagement, he actually went to see Li Zugen once. He wanted to ask them for an explanation for his son, only to hear Li Zugen slandering Zhao Jinge. He said that Zhao Jinge was like a man, and even if he really married Zhao Jinge, he would never want to sleep with him. Zhao Fugui was so angry that he only went home after he slapped Li Zugen.\u201cWell, I won\u2019t marry him,\u201d Zhao Jinge said with great certainty and started thinking about Jiang Zhen again.Jiang Zhen had been thinking about Zhao Jinge too.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At last, they collected the passage fee of two hundred copper pennies per boat and released them. Then they went to a fishing village by the sea.This fishing village was not large, with a total of twenty families living there. They relied on fishing for a living, and their life was very poor. They were even poorer than the people in Hexi Village because many things here couldn\u2019t be bought or grown by them and also because they couldn\u2019t catch fish well every time they fished, so their fish often failed to sell at a good price.For these reasons, they receive merchants who come to the fishing village to buy seafood very well.The merchants who came here with Jiang Zhen were all old acquaintances of the villagers here. When the villagers saw them, they all gathered around them. This was when Jiang Zhen found out that the merchants\u2019 ships were carrying some goods with them.They had brought cloth, and small things like oil and sugar, but most of them had brought grain.They didn\u2019t sell the cloth and other things, but brought them to the villagers to exchange with them. The food they took was only brought out after they all had agreed with the villagers.All the people in the fishing village went to the familiar merchants to exchange their own things and took them to their homes to see the goods. However, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng, who were strangers, were ignored for a while.But obviously, the merchants couldn\u2019t buy all the goods in the village. After a while, a young man in his twenties came to Jiang Zhen saying, \u201cI have some kelp and fish in my house. Do you want it?\u201d\u201cLet me see it,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. When he listened to the merchants talking with the villagers, he had already learned the approximate price of the things there. Now he just planned to take a look at those goods.The man nodded and took Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng to his home.There was a lot of salted fish drying in the sun in front of his door. The family\u2019s house was also full of bundles of dried kelp, which gave off a strong smell of sea fish.Many businessmen who came here couldn\u2019t stand the fishy smell, so this man looked at Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng with worry. As a result, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng were completely unaffected.\u201cTake a look. If you want, you can exchange grain with me or pay for it with money.\u201d That was fair.Jiang Zhen looked and found that these goods were no different from those of the others. He paid for most of the salted fish and all the kelp, which made the man look at him with surprise.Kelp always sold well during the New Year\u2019s festival, because people in Hecheng county would buy some to improve their dishes\u2019 taste at the end of the year, but there weren\u2019t many people who bought it during the rest of the year.Looking at Jiang Zhen, the man hesitated whether to tell him not to buy too much of the dried kelp as Jiang Zhen won\u2019t be able to sell it all. But he was afraid that Jiang Zhen wouldn\u2019t buy his goods, so in the end, he didn\u2019t open his mouth.\u201cIs there anything else?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked. He originally thought that if he brought ten silver, it would be too little. As a result, he only used up two hundred kilos of rice and three or four silver to buy all of these goods.\u201cNothing more.\u201d It was gone.Jiang Zhen heard his words but felt that it was a little bit strange. He remembered that there were many kinds of seafood. How could there be only kelp and salted fish? The variety of salted fish was quite small. The main selling point was that it was salty already. With the price of salt being expensive, in the eyes of many people it was very cost-effective to buy salted fish. Or in fact, it was not that there was nothing else, but that those were things people here didn\u2019t treat as goods?Jiang Zhen immediately changed his question. \u201cWhat do you usually catch when you go out to sea? What do you like to eat?\u201dNow that the man heard these questions, after thinking about that, he took out a bucket and gave Jiang Zhen a bucket of clams.This kind of thing could be seen everywhere on the beach after the tides fell. If you pick it up casually, you would have a pile of it. It\u2019s worthless, and you couldn\u2019t even sell it because it would die before long. It couldn\u2019t be salted and saved.Of course, the most important thing was that they were all shells without meat. Nowadays people didn\u2019t like this kind of food very much.\u201cCan you take me to pick up some?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.Of course, the man didn\u2019t refuse, and took Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng to the beach.In modern times, Jiang Zhen had been to the seaside and to some undeveloped beaches, so he was not surprised to see the sea, but Wang Haisheng was very curious. He looked at the sea constantly and saw that there were shells on the beach. He also picked up several of them, saying he wanted to give them to his children to play with.\u201cAfter you eat the meat from those clams, the shells can be used for fun.\u201d The man that brought them there told them that their children would make toys from all kinds of shells.After the tide, there were a lot of clams on the beach, which even looked a little scary. There were so many of them that after a while Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng had picked up a full bucket.\u201cWould you like to pick up more?\u201d Wang Haisheng asked cheerfully. He liked the beautiful shells of the clams.Jiang Zhen nodded and spent a few copper pennies to buy a very fine fishing net from the man, which was used to store small fish. Then he picked up more clams and put them in the net. It was about three or four hundred kilos.Their boat was not small, but they could not carry too many things. They had to store the salted fish and the kelp. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t continue picking up clams but together with Wang Haisheng brought back the things he bought and the clams he picked up to the boat first.In addition to the clams from the beach, there were actually crabs and other living creatures, but those crabs were very small, so Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t give them any thought.After loading everything on the boat, Jiang Zhen estimated that the load of the boat with salted fish was about 4 or 5 silver.The price of these things can be at least doubled when they are sold outside. If they could be sold out completely, it would still make a good profit, it\u2019s just . . .\u201cYou\u2019ve bought so many things on your first visit. How long will it take to sell them?\u201d The people who came with them looked at Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng with surprise. They were all selling their goods in the county towns near their own homes. Generally, they only bought goods once a month or two, and only at the end of the year would they buy more. These two newcomers bought such a pile at once. Could they sell it out?These people looked at Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng as if they were looking at two fools.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 46": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 39 - Making money in FuchengPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 39 \u2013 Making money in FuchengIn ancient times, information was not smooth, logistics were not convenient, and the common people had very little money, so the majority of merchants did very little business. Although there were also rich businessmen, they were few in number in the end, and in order to make a lot of money they were all basically related to the government.Because of this, those merchants who came together with them to purchase goods were afraid to buy too much. In fact, with the current situation in Hecheng county town, the people could only consume a certain amount of the goods they had bought.When Jiang Zhen bought a shipment of goods like this, they all thought Jiang Zhen was crazy.Wang Haisheng was also a little worried when he heard their words. They did buy a lot of goods. He felt that they had bought so many things, that they wouldn\u2019t be able to sell them for the rest of their lives . . .But at least they were real things that were also very durable. If they couldn\u2019t sell them, they could still eat them themselves.\u201cWe\u2019re going to travel around and sell at the same time,\u201d Jiang Zhen explained but didn\u2019t say that he actually planned to sell in Fucheng. Of course, even if he told these people that he wanted to sell in Fucheng, they probably wouldn\u2019t have understood. There were seafood merchants in Fucheng as well. If Jiang Zhen went there to do business, how could he win against the local merchants?\u201cSo it\u2019s like this. If you visit more remote villages, you should be able to sell some.\u201d He looked at Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng compassionately. Their business didn\u2019t have a shop, so they had to run around like this . . .These seafood merchants stayed in the fishing village for two days and one night before leaving, and Jiang Zhen took this opportunity to understand the situation of the fishing village and the private salt he had thought about before.The price of salt outside was very expensive, but in this fishing village, no one makes and sells salt for any reason whatsoever.At present, the salt-making process couldn\u2019t compare to that of later generations. The salt of later generations is all baked out, and it does not require much manpower or material resources. Therefore, the salt in the supermarket only costs two or three yuan per pack, but it was different at present.At present people made salt mainly by cooking. This way, salt production was more troublesome, and firewood was also needed. Because of this, it was easier to control the people from the other side of the salt field and prevent them from making salt. For example, the people from Hongjiang salt field would send people over to this fishing village from time to time to have a look. If they found out that someone was cutting trees or boiling too much salt, they would kill or capture them. Over time, no one dared to cook too much salt.After learning more about it, Jiang Zhen let go of his previous idea of selling private salt.He didn\u2019t feel that he was rebellious about wanting to sell private salt, because he didn\u2019t have much sense of belonging to this current dynasty called Qi Dynasty. So he didn\u2019t regard it as his own country at all, and the price of the necessities in life was too high for many people to afford to consume.Of course, he didn\u2019t intend to claim justice for these people. Originally, he had that idea mainly for the sake of his own life. Similarly, if he had gone back to the sixties or seventies, in order to live a good life, he would probably secretly do some speculative things, like selling eggs or food stamps. After all, in essence, he did agree with such a system.However, he wanted to sell private salt mainly in order to improve his own life, but he didn\u2019t intend to lose his life. When he found out that the road was too dangerous, Jiang Zhen decided to let it go, but it was still a pity. It was really too easy to make money these days.Their small fleet set out again in the early hours of the morning, and when they arrived at the place where they had been charged a toll of 200 copper pennies before, someone came on board for a check.On board came fierce-looking men, and after they got on, they started checking the things on the boat, especially the salted fish.Jiang Zhen was relieved to see this. He had noticed before, that no one who went with him had bought too much salted fish. After thinking about it, he didn\u2019t buy too much salted fish either. Now it seemed that he did the right thing.\u201cWhat are you doing with these things?\u201d After checking the cargo on Jiang Zhen\u2019s boat, a man stabbed a clam with a knife.\u201cIt was for free.\u201d Jiang Zhen reined in his urge and assumed a weak presence.\u201cNot for free either!\u201d The man laughed and then stretched out his hand to Jiang Zhen. \u201cCome on, two silver.\u201dJiang Zhen didn\u2019t say anything and gave the other party two silver.\u201cYou are new, but you are a fast learner.\u201d The man jumped off the boat and left.Their small fleet was released, and it was not until then that those who came here with Jiang Zhen mentioned some rules to him, such as when you buy two hundred kilos of salted fish or more, you must provide at least one or two silver, which can only be more, not less.These people didn\u2019t seem to reject Jiang Zhen, but in the end they didn\u2019t like him after all. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t think it was strange. After all, no one liked people who competed with them in business. They were already kind to him by taking him with them.After saying farewell to those people, Jiang Zhen split up with them. He and Wang Haisheng didn\u2019t plan to return to Hecheng for the moment but to travel to Fucheng.Jiang Zhen already had an idea about how to sell his own cargo in that seaside fishing village.It was almost a day\u2019s trip to Fucheng from that sea village. Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng traveled slowly along the river, and in the evening, they arrived in Fucheng.Along the way, both Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng were very busy. One of them rowed, and the other one soaked the kelp. At first, they used the traditional method of cutting the kelp into several sections before soaking it. But later, Jiang Zhen got tired of it. He couldn\u2019t use too much water on the boat, so he simply tied up the dried kelp with a rope and threw it directly in the water, letting it soak in the river first before fishing it out.After fishing the kelp up, they took a brush to brush and clean it piece by piece.As for why Jiang Zhen did this, it was related to the way of eating dried kelp and the way people sold kelp at present.People who lived by the sea would make dried kelp and sell it to seafood merchants. When the merchants sold it, they would also sell it directly dry.However, the handling method of dried kelp was very troublesome. Apart from being soaked for a full day and a night, it also needed to be washed. Dried kelp, when bought, looked very small but it would turn very big after being soaked!Often, families couldn\u2019t finish their purchased kelp even after several days; after all, after you eat too much, you would grow tired of it.Because of this, in modern times, no matter if in the supermarket or at the vegetable market, kelp is basically sold cut into pieces. Customers buy as much as they want, but at present, everyone only sold dried kelp.The dried kelp was black and grey, and it really didn\u2019t look good. The price of a piece of kelp was not cheap either. If you were to convert it, the price of a kilo of kelp would be the same as that of pork. Even if a kilo of kelp was soaked, there would be a lot of it, but except for New Year, common people were really reluctant to spend money on it.Jiang Zhen was going to cut the kelp and then sell it.It takes a lot of work to do this, but if he could sell it, he estimated that he could earn a lot more than selling dried kelp, and it was easier to sell it that way.When they arrived in Fucheng and stopped outside the city, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng were busy navigating the boat.They soaked the kelp in the river and washed it clean, cut off the parts that didn\u2019t look good, and then cut it into thin shreds. They had been cutting kelp all day, and their hands were sore when they finally cut three hundred kilos of kelp out of only one hundred kilos of dried kelp.What\u2019s more, a bundle of dried kelp was originally not enough to fill their boat. But it became much more after soaking it, so much that they couldn\u2019t fit it on the ship!The city of Fucheng was very large and prosperous and not comparable to Hecheng county town at all. Every morning, people from outside the city would pick up their vegetables to sell in the city. Some of them sell on the streets while others \u2013 in fixed places.On this day, a boat appeared in the river in Fucheng. Two men came down from the boat and brought out a lot of salted fish and kelp. They were obviously there to sell seafood.There are special shops selling seafood in Fucheng and the people there liked to go to familiar places to buy, so at first no one noticed them or bought things from them until one of them shouted, \u201cKelp! A bowl of kelp for a penny!\u201dA penny for a bowl of kelp? How could they sell kelp in a bowl?Many people were surprised to see that someone was selling cut small green kelp, which was already clean and looked attractive.\u201cHow much for this kelp?\u201d asked an old lady with a basket in her hand.\u201cThat costs one copper penny.\u201d Jiang Zhen picked up a handful of kelp and gave it to the old lady.He put a handful of kelp and it looked like a lot. But when they go home and cook it, they could indeed have a bowl of kelp, and it didn\u2019t weigh much. At least, when Jiang Zhen sold it like this, he would make two or three times as much as if he would sell dried kelp.After packing it, the old lady was very satisfied. She was reluctant to buy dried kelp for twenty or thirty coppers, but she was willing to spend one copper to add an extra dish on her table.After the old lady took the lead in buying kelp, other people came as well. Most of them asked for one copper of kelp. But some of them wanted two or three coppers of kelp, so they wanted Jiang Zhen to pack more as a discount.\u201cIf I give you more, I am going to lose money.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled and didn\u2019t give others more kelp for free, but he instead took two clams from the side and gave them away. \u201cTake these. You can give them to the children to play with.\u201dMany people in this city had never seen clams, so they were shocked. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d\u201cClams are from the sea. The meat in them can be eaten, but it\u2019s not much,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. When he was in Hexi Village, he always felt like a stranger, and he didn\u2019t like attracting clients with such a smile by nature, but he was short of money now.What had he not done on a mission before? Wasn\u2019t it just selling things with enthusiasm? In fact, it was nothing. Of course, he had to do this mainly because Wang Haisheng couldn\u2019t attract customers, and he couldn\u2019t count or calculate money either.Jiang Zhen\u2019s stall was on the river bank, and their ship was in the river. Now Jiang Zhen was in charge of selling, while Wang Haisheng continued washing kelp.They had to soak the kelp for at least a day before they could sell it. Wang Haisheng was now busy with the next day\u2019s business.Jiang Zhen picked up a lot of clams and mainly used them as an addition. He even sold some of them for three coppers per kilo. When selling them, Jiang Zhen would say, \u201cThere is sand inside. If you want to eat it, you\u2019d better keep it for a few days. Otherwise, you can dig out the meat, wash it and cook it with salted vegetables.\u201d People here often cooked mussels with salted vegetables.At the end of the day, three hundred kilos of kelp were sold with a lot of salted fish and even half of the clams were sold.The price of salted fish they sold was the same as that of others, so they didn\u2019t earn much, but the kelp was very profitable. Although the price was cheap, they still made good money after adding it up. It was just that selling all the kelp would take many days, and they would be very busy during this period of time.The night before, Jiang Zhen was so busy with the kelp that he didn\u2019t sleep well. He really didn\u2019t want to work until late at night. After thinking about it, he simply spent two salted fishes to hire a 12- or 13-year-old boy to help.The next day, Jiang Zhen continued to sell kelp.The people who had bought a penny of kelp the day before had basically eaten up all the kelp they bought. Some of them bought more today. In addition, they also brought in some new clients . . .Within ten days Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng sold all the kelp, but in the last few days, their business was not very good, because the other seafood merchants in the city also learned to wash and cut the kelp before selling it.He finally came up with a way to make money, but he could only use it once. Jiang Zhen felt it was a pity, but he was very satisfied after counting the money he had on his hand.He had spent about 12 silver on this purchase adding the money spent on travel, but he earned 30 silver in the past few days. In other words, he made a total of 18 silver on this trip, almost earning back the money he had spent for the boat. There was also a lot of sea cargo left on the ship.Of course, making money was making money. But they also got tired.After Jiang Zhen discussed it with Wang Haisheng, they decided to take a day off before going back. But they didn\u2019t know that during that time, Zhao Jinge\u2019s family had been entangled in troubles.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Li family refused to give up.In fact, Li Zugen didn\u2019t want to marry Zhao Jinge. He was very thin and small while Zhao Jinge was a head taller than him. If they were to stand together, others might think that he was the ger. In that case, it would be strange for him to become interested in Zhao Jinge.But his family . . .Li Zugen\u2019s father was as thin and small as he was, and his mother was not a very hard worker. The eldest of his four children was only ten years old. Although he was small, he ate a lot.They . . . couldn\u2019t just sit still when there was nothing to eat.If there was another choice, the Li family would certainly not choose Zhao Jinge, but was there any other choice? Under the persuasion of his parents, Li Zugen gritted his teeth and agreed to marry Zhao Jinge. Then they started taking actions.After Matchmaker He had a bad start, Li Liu, Li Zugen\u2019s mother went to battle in person. She found the Zhao family, complained and cried, and asked for a marriage between Zhao Jinge and her son.Zhao Liu was naturally unwilling, but Li Zugen\u2019s mother was so insistent that she would not give up until she achieved her goal. She came to pressure her every day. And she was different from Matchmaker He. Matchmaker He belittled Zhao Jinge, but she praised Zhao Jinge from the very beginning. She said that she really wanted Zhao Jinge to become her daughter-in-law, and she would certainly be nice to him in the future.\u201cJinge is a kid I have liked since he was a child. If it wasn\u2019t for that little bastard in my family who took a blind fancy to Xue, Jinge would have already become my daughter-in-law.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think there is anyone better than Jinge within ten miles or even in town. How could he be rejected? You can\u2019t listen to this matchmaker\u2019s nonsense.\u201d\u201cWhen Jinge comes to our house, we will treat him well and never neglect him.\u201d\u201cThose four children are going to leave in the future. Jinge has entered our family, so I will make sure that his children will become the most importantly ones.\u201d. . .When Li Liu went to the Zhao family\u2019s house every day, she seemed to be very sincere, just like she did when she asked for marriage with Zhao Jinge before. She seemed so sincere that, gradually, the people in Hexi Village began to speak up for her.Although Zhao Liu didn\u2019t like to socialize with others, there were still some people who knew her in Hexi Village. These days, the Zhao family was very lively. These people came to the Zhao family to watch and help Zhao Liu.\u201cYour Jinge can\u2019t stay unmarried forever.\u201d\u201cRemember that bald old man from the village who couldn\u2019t marry a wife? He starved to death in the house last year and no one knew.\u201d\u201cThat man was injured and ill. Someone should have helped him.\u201d. . .There was no malice in these people. They were sincere in their persuasion.Zhao Liu herself was not such a firm person. She didn\u2019t like Li Zugen much before, but now, after listening to these people talking, she suddenly found Li Zugen to be not particularly bad. Their family was a mess, but somehow, they still had their land. As long as Jinge was willing to work, he would not go hungry. Moreover, their family\u2019s son was very thin, so Jinge could always beat him up.After Jinge gets married, maybe he can live a good life?Zhao Liu thought so, so that night, she spoke to Zhao Jinge. \u201cJinge, the Li family comes here every day . . .\u201d\u201cMother, I will not marry him,\u201d Zhao Jinge said determined, frowning at the same time.When Jiang Zhen went to buy seafood, at first, he said that he would be gone for about five days, but now it had been more than ten days. Why hasn\u2019t he come back yet? He had no one to inquire about news regarding Jiang Zhen. He was worried and was pestered every day by the Li family, so he was in a really bad mood.Zhao Liu sighed. \u201cJinge, mother knows that you would miss father and mother, but you also need to think about your future . . .\u201d\u201cMother, anyway, I will not marry Li Zugen.\u201d Zhao Jinge was determined.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to become a stepmother or do you hate what their family did before?\u201d Zhao Liu asked again.\u201cNeither,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. That Li Zugen annulled the engagement did not make him feel bad. And as for being a stepmother, he really didn\u2019t feel anything.\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Zhao Liu was puzzled.Zhao Jinge hesitated for a moment before saying, \u201cI don\u2019t like him.\u201d I now . . . I like Jiang Zhen.When Zhao Liu heard this answer, she was even more puzzled. It took her a while to figure it out. \u201cDo you think he is too thin? Yes, he is also too small!\u201dZhao Jinge didn\u2019t like Li Zugen. Of course, it was not because of his stature, but Zhao Liu thought so, so he accepted it and reiterated, \u201cI won\u2019t marry him.\u201d\u201cWell, Jinge, if you don\u2019t want to marry, forget it.\u201d Zhao Liu sighed.Zhao Jinge breathed a sigh of relief.On the other side, Jiang Zhen put away his stall and casually tasted Wang Haisheng\u2019s cooking. Then he went in the fishing boat full of fishy smell and fell asleep.These days, although he hired a child to help him, he was still very tired due to overworking.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t wake up until the sun rose the next morning.A few days ago, when he was tense, he was able to hold on. As soon as he relaxed, he felt a bit weak. Fortunately, they had a rest day today.In order to save money, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng both slept on the boat and usually cooked some rice and kelp for their meals. But today, they were free after earning money, so they didn\u2019t have to treat themselves poorly.Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng made a pot of rice and bought some pork and fried vegetables. They comfortably ate two bowls each.\u201cWatch over the boat. I\u2019ll go in the city.\u201d After eating, Jiang Zhen said that to Wang Haisheng.There was a lot of salted fish and kelp on their ship that they hadn\u2019t sold yet. They were going to take it to Hecheng county town, so the boat had to be watched over.Wang Haisheng agreed, and Jiang Zhen went ashore to wander around the city.This city was bigger than Hecheng, but he didn\u2019t know by how much. It\u2019s probably because it\u2019s located in the south of the Yangtze River, that\u2019s why there are no tall and towering city walls, and the business seemed very prosperous.Jiang Zhen had inquired about the prices of various commodities in Hecheng before. When he arrived here, he had also inquired about the prices in Fucheng City. When he returned to Hecheng, he could not go back with an empty boat. He should bring some goods back.Some things in Fucheng were more expensive than in Hecheng, and some things were cheaper than in Hecheng. For example, the prices of oil and some beautiful fabrics here were much lower than in Hecheng.The most profitable thing these days were definitely luxury goods. However, Jiang Zhen simply did not have the capital to buy such goods, so he planned to buy those daily necessities that were cheaper than those in Hecheng and take them back with him.What Jiang Zhen wanted most was oil, but at present, the oil pressing workshop was not responsible for preparing oil barrels for those who came to buy oil. For a while, he couldn\u2019t get any oil barrels, so he gave up on buying oil for the moment and went to a dyeing workshop to buy 30 silver worth of fabrics.After buying some oil paper, he wrapped all the fabrics carefully and put them on a shelf in the fishing boat. Jiang Zhen breathed a sigh of relief. The day was almost over.Early the next morning, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng set off for Hecheng, and it was already dark by the time they arrived in Hecheng.Since it was getting dark, Jiang Zhen did not rush back to Hexi Village but slept on the boat all night. Early the next morning, he took the fabrics to the cloth shop in the county town.There were two cloth shops in Hecheng, one was a bit smaller, and the other one was a bit larger. These two cloth shops buy cloth themselves, dyeing it in their own stores before selling it. They also sell ordinary cloth with a few simple colors.However, they occasionally went out to buy goods, so when Jiang Zhen brought cloth to their doors, they accepted it, but there was not much profit made. Thirty silver worth of fabrics was sold for thirty-two silver and soon changed hands.During this half-month\u2019s trip, Jiang Zhen earned a total of 22 silver. If other people knew about this, they would be jealous to death. After all, Jiang Chengxiang\u2019s previous job earned him two silver a month. Zhao Jinge worked a full year but only earned 3 or 4 silver.But in fact, it was not much, and the purchasing power was equivalent to 20,000 yuan in the future.After packing the silver, Jiang Zhen went to buy five kilos of pork before going back to Hexi.It was noon when Jiang Zhen arrived in Hexi. In the morning, he spent only two coppers for two bowls of porridge at the dock. Right then, he was hungry and homesick.Together with Wang Haisheng, he picked up the rest of the kelp and the salted fish. When Jiang Zhen went to the village, he was thinking about Zhao Jinge. Although he was very hungry, he made a special detour to Zhao Dahu\u2019s house. As a result, Zhao Jinge who always worked in the field at this time, was not here.Jiang Zhen went home a bit frustrated. He planned to cook a meal for Zhao Jinge and then go out to find him. But he didn\u2019t expect to see Zhao Jinge near his house.He didn\u2019t know why there were so many people gathered around the Zhao family. There was also a short man talking to Zhao Jinge. But seeing that this man actually grabbed Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand, Jiang Zhen immediately got angry.How dare someone flirt with his man! It was time to kill!Jiang Zhen was already very unhappy, when he happened to hear someone say, \u201cJinge, Li Zugen is sincere. You should marry him!\u201dIn a moment, the flames in Jiang Zhen\u2019s heart suddenly turned into a sea of fire. In order to do business in the past half a month, he had been holding down his temper, but now he couldn\u2019t hold it any longer. Jiang Zhen threw down the load he was carrying and rushed over with a bamboo pole.Zhao Jinge was actually very angry at that moment.He had been working well at Zhao Dahu\u2019s family that day, but unexpectedly, in the middle of his work, a thin man came with his four children. The man approached him, shouting, \u201cJinge!\u201d and his four children came over and called him, \u201cMother!\u201dHearing such calls, Zhao Jinge\u2019s face suddenly turned black. At the same time, he recognized the man. Who was it if not Li Zugen?Although Jiang Zhen sometimes looked shy, his whole body was very robust. But that man was different. He was thin and small, obviously a little creepy.The most important thing was that when Jiang Zhen looked at him, his eyes were full of him. He could see him blushing and hear his heart beating, but this person was the opposite. Zhao Jinge looked at this man\u2019s evasive eyes and then at the four children who followed him. At that moment, he was really eager to learn from Jiang Zhen how to beat people up.It was just that, although he was pretty strong, he was still a ger. When he was a child, he was detained at home by Zhao Liu, so he had no experience in fighting with the other children his age. Later, when he grew up, he wouldn\u2019t start a fight with others either, so he felt helpless now. And what\u2019s more, he was still followed by four children!It took Zhao Jinge some time to tear the four children off himself. Amid their cries, he was scolding Li Zugen, asking him to leave. However, Li Zugen refused to leave and continued pestering Zhao Jinge, making it impossible for him to continue working.Seeing this scene, Zhao Dahu, who came to check the field, asked Zhao Jinge to go home to solve this matter. As a result, when Zhao Jinge went home, Li Zugen followed him with his children calling him \u201cmother\u201d and saying that they wanted to live in the Zhaos\u2019 house.He was going to rely on the Zhao family!Zhao Fugui\u2019s workplace was a bit far away, so he couldn\u2019t come back for a while. In the meantime the villagers advised him to marry Li Zugen . . . Zhao Jinge clenched his fists, already wanting to punch Li Zugen. He didn\u2019t expect to see a dusty Jiang Zhen at this moment.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 48": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 41.1 - Jiang Zhen comes to take the wife by forcePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 41.1 \u2013 Jiang Zhen comes to take the wife by forceThat day, the Li family came here with the idea of forcing a marriage. Li Zugen took his children to live in the house of the Zhao family. This way, even if Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t want to marry him, he would have to! If the Zhao family beat someone up . . . or if the people of the Zhao family hurt someone, it would be the Zhao family\u2019s fault. They could then catch them and ask for compensation. If the Zhao family couldn\u2019t pay the compensation, wouldn\u2019t they have to make Zhao Jinge compensate them?It was an indisputable truth that evil thoughts originated from poverty. Because people were poor, they would do anything, even losing their collective face. This time, the Li family were going to lose their face.Every family in Hexi had a fairly good life, so to them, the behavior of the Li family was a bit shameless. But although they were shameless, Zhao Jinge really couldn\u2019t find a better match than this Li family. Moreover, the Li family came to them every day, so even if they didn\u2019t have anything else, they were, at least, sincere. They thought that they really wanted Zhao Jinge to marry in. What\u2019s more, the two families had been connected by an engagement in the past.People in the countryside always believed in persuasion and refused to consider minor points. When they saw the four children without a mother, the people in Hexi tried to persuade Zhao Jinge to agree.For a ger like Zhao Jinge, who was manly and was already so old, even if he got married at this point, it wasn\u2019t certain that he could have children, so it was not a bad idea to pick up children that were already there . . .Yes, just like what Matchmaker He once said, Zhao Jinge might not be able to have a baby. There were many people in Hexi who thought the same way.Although digging out one\u2019s cinnabar mole did not affect fertility, in regards to Zhao Jinge . . . it was more difficult for a ger to have a child than a woman. But he didn\u2019t even look like a typical ger. At first glance, one would assume he was clearly a man . . . Could he really have a baby?\u201cJinge, these children have been crying for such a long time. Take them in to wash their faces first.\u201d\u201cI have something to say.\u201d\u201cI think this Li Zugen is very sincere.\u201d. . .The people in the village all advised Zhao Jinge, and Li Zugen said, \u201cJinge, I used to be too stupid, I didn\u2019t know your good points. I will change. I will treat you well in the future.\u201dWith that said, when Li Zugen looked at Zhao Jinge, he still couldn\u2019t hide his unhappiness, shifting his eyes evasively.\u201cMother . . .\u201d two of the four children called again, but only the two of them were sincere. Xue had been living in the landlord\u2019s house for several years. They hadn\u2019t seen their mother since they were young, so they didn\u2019t have a deep impression of her. Recently, their grandmother said that they could have a good life after they called back their mother, so they were very enthusiastic in recognizing their new mother.Before, Zhao Jinge would have definitely pulled the two children off him and clearly stated that he was not their mother, but now . . . watching Jiang Zhen approach, Zhao Jinge couldn\u2019t recover in time.Li Zugen, seeing that Jinge was not as unyielding as before, only thought he had finally softened up. He knew that someone like Zhao Jinge, who couldn\u2019t get married and was so old and ugly, would like anyone who was nice to him and would definitely not refuse him . . .\u201cJinge . . .\u201d Li Zugen was going to grab Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand again, but before he could do so, his hand suddenly started hurting, as if his bones had been broken. \u201cAh!\u201d Li Zugen cradled his hand and screamed, wondering what happened.As a result, before he could understand the situation, he was grabbed by the collar and picked up, and then faced a ferocious face.Jiang Zhen had already figured out what was going on from the conversations of the people around him. Someone had tried to steal his lover while he was not at home! As soon as he picked up Li Zugen, he threw him out without thinking.Speaking about it, Jiang Zhenwei\u2019s body was actually a little shorter than Jiang Zhen\u2019s original body. His original body was 1.87 meters tall, but this body was only 1.78 meters tall at most. But it was the ancient times and most men were shorter than 1.7 meters, so his figure stood out from the crowd.As for the man in front of him . . . he estimated that he was shorter than 1.6 meters, maybe a little above 1.5 meters. He wasn\u2019t tall, and in addition he was very thin. Therefore, even if Jiang Zhen had been through a long journey and was actually very tired at that moment, he could still easily throw him out.Li Zugen was directly thrown down by Jiang Zhen to the grassy area nearby and couldn\u2019t get up for a while. Right then, the people of Hexi saw Jiang Zhen clearly. No one knew where Eldest Jiang had gone the past few days but now . . . He is back! He hit people as soon as he came back! How lawless! But they . . . couldn\u2019t do anything about it.The villagers of Hexi originally surrounding Zhao Jinge scattered around, but they didn\u2019t run too far. There was so little entertainment these days that they all wanted to stay and witness what was about to happen. As for the possibility of being beaten up, well, with so many people here, it was impossible for Eldest Jiang to beat them all. At worst, they could still run away when the time came.Everyone\u2019s eyes fell on Jiang Zhen.At that moment, Jiang Zhen took two steps forward, picked up the child holding Zhao Jinge\u2019s thigh in one hand and then directly threw him towards the other two children calling Zhao Jinge \u201cmother\u201d. The ground was all mud, so there were no stones at all. He was sure that he wouldn\u2019t break anything or injure anyone, so he was at ease.Li Zugen just screamed, and the two young boys were so frightened that they started crying bitterly. The smaller one even wetted his pants.Li Zugen\u2019s eldest son was already ten years old. He knew a lot of things. Before, he had just watched his second brother, unwilling to pester Zhao Jinge. After Jiang Zhen suddenly made a move, he even grabbed his younger brother to run away. However, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t give him a chance to run away at all. The two other children were also caught by Jiang Zhen and were dropped directly by their father\u2019s side.Seeing that Li Zugen was already getting up, Jiang Zhen quickly came forward and hit his chest with his pole.Li Zugen was then forced by the pole on his shoulder to lie down again. \u201cYou . . . Who are you?\u201dLi Zugen didn\u2019t understand why he was being beaten up.The people of Hexi also didn\u2019t understand why Jiang Zhen was beating up Li Zugen. It was understandable for Jiang Zhen to beat the Jiang family before, but Li Zugen . . . It isn\u2019t because he is in the way, is it?\u201cYou don\u2019t even know who I am, and you are making trouble at my doorstep? Are you tired of living?\u201d Jiang Zhen once again hit Li Zugen\u2019s shoulder with the pole. He deliberately chose a place that would not hurt permanently but would be very painful, so it made Li Zugen cry out again.The people of Hexi looked at Jiang Zhen\u2019s house, which was half a mile from here and then looked at Li Zugen. They couldn\u2019t help but sympathize with him. People in the village knew who Jiang Zhen was, but Li Zugen didn\u2019t know. The closest house to them was actually the house of the Zhao family.\u201cAre you from the Zhao family? You hit me!\u201d Li Zugen looked at Jiang Zhen in disbelief. Although his mother told him to be careful not to be beaten up, he didn\u2019t think it would happen at all. Zhao Jinge should cry and beg him to marry him. How come he was beaten up instead?Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t agree before, was it probably because he wanted to raise his bride price?\u201cZhao Jinge, I can\u2019t believe you let someone beat me! I insist that you\u2014\u201d Li Zugen originally wanted to shout some cruel remarks, but fortunately, while he was in the middle of his speech, he remembered his plan. \u201cZhao Jinge, even if you don\u2019t agree to get married and asked someone to beat me up, we from Lijia Village won\u2019t give up!\u201dAfter being beaten up, they could ask the villagers to help them out and then ask the Zhao family to give them an explanation . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Then let them come to me!\u201d Jiang Zhen pushed Li Zugen\u2019s eldest son, who was trying to get up and escape, to the ground. \u201cWhen they come to my turf, they will need to play hard with me. To death if necessary!\u201d\u201cThis . . . are you Eldest Jiang?\u201d asked Li Zugen\u2019s mother, Li Liushi, who had been around all the time. She was shocked before, but at this point she finally returned to her senses, recognizing Jiang Zhen and remembering the rumors going around about Jiang Zhen that she had heard in Hexi these days. Jiang Zhen was an ominous star, and they . . . they shouldn\u2019t provoke him!\u201cYou are clever,\u201d Jiang Zhen sneered. \u201cWho are you and what are you doing near my house? You\u2019re in the way to my home, don\u2019t you know?\u201d\u201cThis . . . This . . .\u201d Li Zugen\u2019s mother was actually a very outspoken person, but the shock she experienced at that moment made her look really terrible. She didn\u2019t dare provoke him at all and could only explain, \u201cWe are from Lijia Village. We came to the Zhao family today to propose marriage, and we really didn\u2019t want to block your way.\u201dJiang Zhen didn\u2019t recognize these people before. After all, Eldest Jiang was a man who rarely left his own village. But now, after hearing Lijia Village several times, he had already guessed the identity of these people. Aren\u2019t they . . . the family Zhao Jinge used to be engaged to?Lijia was not far from there, and Li Zugen would also come to Hexi to play when he was a child. When he played with others, every time he accidentally lost in the game, he would immediately run back to cry to his mother. Then his mother would go to the other children\u2019s houses and accuse the other children of bullying her son . . .However, Eldest Jiang also had an impression of him, because the Jiang family had also been visited. Of course, it was not him who had bullied Li Zugen, but Jiang Chengwen. God knows how Jiang Chengwen, who was six or seven years younger than Li Zugen, had bullied him . . .Jiang Zhen had always known about this family, but he never paid attention to them before. When Zhao Jinge was twelve or thirteen years old, the Li family annulled the engagement. Li Zugen didn\u2019t even count as Zhao Jinge\u2019s ex-boyfriend, so there was nothing to care about. As a result, the family unexpectedly came to visit!Jiang Zhen subconsciously glanced at Zhao Jinge, and saw Zhao Jinge\u2019s face full of uneasiness . . . Zhao Jinge had a good temper and he was probably frightened by the Li family. As the current boyfriend, it was necessary for him to kill this ex-boyfriend who was trying to get between them.Jiang Zhen cheered up and planned to teach this Li Zugen a lesson, but he didn\u2019t know that Zhao Jinge\u2019s uneasiness was mainly caused by him.When he first saw Jiang Zhen, Zhao Jinge was very surprised and happy, but after a while he became worried. He\u2019d entangled the just-returned Jiang Zhen in this mess. Will Jiang Zhen feel unhappy? There used to be a beautiful woman in the village who was pestered by a bachelor from another village, and as a result, her husband beat her up and started disliking her for attracting bees and butterflies. In the end, this made the woman not dare to go out.He and Jiang Zhen weren\u2019t married. If Jiang Zhen felt unhappy, he might directly marry someone else. Zhao Jinge grew more and more uneasy as he thought about it and regretted not ending this matter earlier.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know what Zhao Jinge felt or thought. He just sneered and said to Li Liu, \u201cHaven\u2019t you already annulled this engagement a long time ago? Your son already has so many children, and he still comes to propose marriage?\u201d At first sight, he knew that the four children were that shortie\u2019s offspring.\u201cTheir mother already married another . . .\u201dIt turned out that this was the case\u2014his wife ran away and he wanted to start over! Jiang Zhen glared and hit Li Zugen\u2019s leg with the pole. \u201cWhat a beautiful idea!\u201d\u201cEldest Jiang, you can\u2019t hit people like this. We haven\u2019t provoked you.\u201d Liu Li felt worse when she saw her son being hit than if it were her being hit. She felt so distressed that she was full of resentment towards Jiang Zhen.Getting in his way? . . . The countryside was full of muddy roads. Where people trod a lot on, these areas would be called paths. In fact, as long as you didn\u2019t step on other people\u2019s crops, you could walk anywhere. It was clear that this man was looking for a random reason to mess with them!\u201cWho said you didn\u2019t mess with me? You are pissing me off,\u201d Jiang Zhen declared. \u201cI like this ger, but you even want to rob him from me!\u201dBefore, Jiang Zhen thought about concealing his relationship with Zhao Jinge because he was afraid of Yang Jing\u2019s revenge and the villagers treating the Zhao family like outcasts. But these days, he became sure that Yang Jing would never dare to take revenge against him. As for the villagers . . . these people even wanted Zhao Jinge to marry someone else . . . He would rather prefer they excluded the Zhao family. Anyway, his father-in-law worked outside all day, and his mother-in-law took care of the five ducklings every day. In fact, it didn\u2019t matter if they didn\u2019t interact with the villagers. If someone tried to bully them . . . it\u2019s not like he can\u2019t help out!This . . . the ger Eldest Jiang likes? Eldest Jiang . . . does he have a crush on Zhao Jinge? I never thought . . .The people in the village were a bit dumbfounded, but the Li family quickly accepted it. No wonder this man hit them as soon as he showed up. It turned out he wanted Zhao Jinge to be his concubine!\u201cDo you like Zhao Jinge?\u201d Li Zugen asked in disbelief when he heard Eldest Jiang. The current situation was very strange to him. How could such a powerful figure fall in love with Zhao Jinge? He could easily snatch any woman to be his wife, couldn\u2019t he?\u201cYes, I like Zhao Jinge,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. \u201cI have a preference for gers with strong bodies.\u201d He said it all. Although Zhao Jinge was too thin, he had gained some flesh, which made him more and more satisfied.So Eldest Jiang took a fancy to Zhao Jinge for his strong body? Also, if he married such a ger, he would be able to throw all the work in the family to him from now on. This Eldest Jiang didn\u2019t do any work each day. They knew at a glance that he was not willing to work. And right now, he was trying to get someone to help him with his work! And . . . the body was sturdy and would be resistant to beating . . . Maybe he wanted to find someone he couldn\u2019t kill off easily by accident.Elder Jiang and Zhao Jinge had no contact before. These days, they also communicated very privately, so the people in the village didn\u2019t know that they had already been meeting secretly.Thinking that the Zhao family had always been good-tempered, the villagers even started sympathizing with Zhao Jinge. Then everyone saw that Zhao Jinge stood still, like he was made of wood, as if he didn\u2019t know what happened. Zhao Jinge was really unlucky . . . He was to be pitied, but actually, Zhao Jinge was quite happy.In the past, he and Jiang Zhen had to meet secretly, which made him feel insecure. He had always been afraid that Jiang Zhen would go back on his words, but now . . . Jiang Zhen admitted his relationship with him. And\u2026 Jiang Zhen likes my strong body. Should I start to train more?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He seemed completely dazed; his eyes were full of confusion while Zhao Liu . . . Zhao Liu was entangled with Li Liu until Jiang Zhen showed up. And when he got rid of Li Liu, she hid to one side. Then she watched Jiang Zhen teach Li Zugen a lesson.At first, she was a bit grateful to Jiang Zhen. Although she had considered persuading Zhao Jinge to agree to the Li family\u2019s marriage proposal before, the behavior of the Li family today made her very angry, so she was very happy to see Li Zugen get beaten up. Of course, she was still a bit scared. As a result . . . Jiang Zhen unexpectedly said that he had a crush on her Jinge?Zhao Liu, who already had red eyes after entangling with Li Liu, suddenly heard such a remark and subconsciously shed tears. She was frightened and a bit surprised. Her Jinge was unexpectedly being liked and pursued. Zhao Liu suddenly cried, which made the villagers of Hexi feel more sympathetic towards her.Fortunately, the Zhao family refused Li Zugen before, but they didn\u2019t expect to get in trouble with this evil star right then. That Jiang Zhen was so ruthless towards his own parents that if he really got married to Zhao Jinge, he might drive out Zhao Liu, this old lady who couldn\u2019t do any work and still needed to see a doctor and take medicine from time to time.\u201cYou-You . . .\u201d Li Zugen looked at Jiang Zhen and regretted that he couldn\u2019t speak at this moment. If he had known that there was such an evil spirit around Zhao Jinge, he would not have come to meet him.\u201cYou? What you?\u201d Jiang Zhen patted his face with his bamboo pole. \u201cDon\u2019t you ever come near Zhao Jinge again. You know, if I see you in Hexi Village in the future, I will beat you up at once!\u201d The words Jiang Zhen said really frightened the Li family.Although Li Zugen yelled that the people from Lijia Village would come out to stand up for him, he could only call in a few uncles of his own family at most. It would have been enough to deal with the Zhao family that had no support in Hexi, but now there was this Jiang Zhen . . .The people in Lijia were no fools. Who would want to offend an evil star who even dared to beat up a yamen official just to get a wife for Li Zugen? Therefore, Li Zugen and his family might not even be able to persuade their own family\u2019s uncles, so they could only end up being beaten up for nothing at the moment. Speaking of which, had it not been for Jiang Zhen, this Li family\u2019s coercion might really have ended with Li Zugen marrying Zhao Jinge.Zhao Fugui and Zhao Jinge were honest people. They were not good at talking and could only hide when confronted by someone. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to solve the matter with the Li family by themselves. When Zhao Jinge\u2019s reputation started to become bad, everyone tried to persuade him to marry. In order to not let his parents worry, he might really have been wed forcefully . . . But now . . . Apart from Jiang Zhen\u2019s act of showing up to drive people away, it was Zhao Jinge himself . . . He liked Jiang Zhen in his heart, so he would never agree to marry Li Zugen.The Li father and his four sons were thrown out one after the other by Jiang Zhen and finally left in disgrace. Some good people from Hexi also followed them. They were going to Lijia to talk to the people they were familiar with in order to spread Jiang Zhen\u2019s \u201cprestige.\u201d However, some people stayed behind, wondering what Jiang Zhen and the Zhao family would do next.\u201cWhat are you looking at? Get out of here!\u201d Jiang Zhen frowned, looking around. It was okay to let these people watch the hustle and bustle just then, but now, he didn\u2019t want people watching him.The people who were stared at by Jiang Zhen all ran away. Even Zhao Liu wanted to hide in her own house.\u201cMother, wait a minute,\u201d Jiang Zhen stopped Zhao Liu.Zhao Liu was a bit confused. She looked at Jiang Zhen stupidly. Did she hear correctly? This man called her mother?After Jiang Zhen came here, he never called old lady Jiang his mother, but when he called for Zhao Liu, there was no such reservation. Zhao Liu was an ordinary rural woman with many shortcomings, but she was really much better than old lady Jiang. At least, she really loved Zhao Jinge and didn\u2019t do anything harmful to other people. In the past, when the Zhao family\u2019s situation was still good, she even gave some food to Eldest Jiang when she saw that he was hungry.\u201cI didn\u2019t bring anything back with me this time. You can take these back, Mother, and cook them.\u201d Jiang Zhen took out the freshly cut meat, a few salted fishes, and some kelp from the parcel he carried, and stuffed them in Zhao Liu\u2019s hands.These things were not light. Jiang Zhen held them easily, but when Zhao Liu held them, she felt her hands become so heavy that she almost stumbled forward.Jiang Zhen helped her up and said, \u201cMother, go back to your house and have some rest. I will come to propose marriage tomorrow.\u201d In fact, he also wanted to imitate that Li Zugen and enter the Zhao family. But he thought that the Zhao family would like to have a good talk and a discussion first, so he didn\u2019t want to get involved yet.Zhao Liu went inside the house in a daze while Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen hesitantly. The worry and joy in his eyes couldn\u2019t be hidden.\u201cJinge, what do you want as a marriage gift?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked. He had given Zhao Jinge five ducklings in addition to the food he gave him. Now that they were getting married, shouldn\u2019t he give them something to wear?Zhao Jinge became stiff and hurried to his home. He didn\u2019t know if it was because he didn\u2019t look ahead, but he bumped against the doorframe. Then he finally came to his senses and entered the house quickly, closing the door behind him.Jiang Zhen touched his nose and couldn\u2019t help laughing.\u201cJiang Zhen, this . . .\u201d Wang Haisheng looked at Jiang Zhen foolishly and was a bit confused by the current situation.He got along with Jiang Zhen for a month and always thought that Jiang Zhen was a good man with a helpful and gentle temper. As a result . . . ly, when they met some difficult clients in the city before, he was angry that Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t take it seriously. How could Jiang Zhen suddenly be so . . . fierce?\u201cTell me, what do you have to prepare for a marriage?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked. Eldest Jiang\u2019s two younger brothers were married, but because old Madam Jiang never let him have any money on his hand, he didn\u2019t know exactly what to prepare for the marriage. He only knew that a lot of work needed to be done at that time.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same everywhere, so I don\u2019t know. At that time, I took Sun Xiaoshan to make a new set of clothes, bought a quilt, some dishes, ten kilos of pork and a chicken, and we lived together,\u201d Wang Haisheng said.When he saw Jiang Zhen looking forward to getting married, he immediately felt that Jiang Zhen must have become so angry because he lost his temper. If someone were to pester his ger, taking advantage of his absence, he would lose his temper too. And . . . Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t really do anything to those people. Wasn\u2019t he just bluffing? In fact, it was nothing.Wang Haisheng recovered some peace of mind, while Jiang Zhen was thinking about how to get married. After pondering on it for a while, it suddenly occurred to him that he should not worry about it alone. Knowing from Eldest Jiang\u2019s memories that the Zhao family intended to marry someone into the family, he decided to go to the Zhao family. In this case, the marriage should be considered by the Zhao family.Some men would feel ashamed of being humiliated, but Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t really have this thought. He would just have a child with the surname Zhao birthed by Zhao Jinge.In modern times, he didn\u2019t have any family, so he didn\u2019t need to carry on the family line. And when he came here, there was no need to carry on the family name for those of the Jiang family that were no good. Naturally, there was no need to fight for a surname. In addition, there was not much difference between being married into the family and marrying a wife . . . Furthermore, as far as he knew, in the countryside, those families who had brought in their son-in-law were generally holding onto their son-in-law. Nowadays, the wife could run away and the man could run away as well, even though men were more likely to run away than women who were taught to take care of their families. Of course, there were still men who were being oppressed, like Eldest Jiang, and there were still men who didn\u2019t know how to run away. And the more such a person behaved like that, the easier it was for their family to grow more and more arrogant each day.But the son-in-law was a big man. He would be the pillar of the family. Who could cause him trouble? So now he didn\u2019t have to worry about getting married. He just needed to figure out what gift to give Zhao Jinge.While Jiang Zhen went back to his house and pondered over this matter while cooking, Zhao Jinge and his mother looked at each other and were both speechless. After a while, it was Zhao Liu who spoke first. \u201cJinge, what can we do now?\u201dZhao Jinge was silent for a moment, then he finally said, \u201cActually . . . it would be nice to marry Jiang Zhen . . . I don\u2019t have to be a stepmother. You\u2019ll still live nearby.\u201dBefore, Zhao Jinge had refused to marry Li Zugen, so Zhao Liu didn\u2019t expect that he would be willing to marry Jiang Zhen. Suddenly, when she heard what Zhao Jinge said, she was so stunned that she thought she had heard it wrong.After a while, Zhao Liu said, \u201cJinge, you don\u2019t have to wrong yourself for your parents. If you don\u2019t want to marry, we won\u2019t make you marry anyone. In the worst case, we can move away secretly, then Jiang Zhen won\u2019t be able to follow us.\u201dZhao Jinge, who once thought about his whole family moving away, so that he could marry Jiang Zhen: \u201c. . .\u201d. . .Zhao Fugui finished his work earlier that day, and went home sooner. As he was going back, he planned to fill their water tank with water and cut some firewood along the way. As a result, when he was walking along Hexi\u2019s river as usual, he suddenly noticed that there was something wrong with the way some people were looking at him and someone even sighed at him.What happened to these people?Zhao Fugui couldn\u2019t comprehend this situation. Then he saw that one passerby left after giving him a sympathetic look before turning his head.What on earth is going on? Is it . . . Something happened at home?Zhao Fugui got worried and didn\u2019t dare to delay any longer. He hurried back home. As a result, as soon as he arrived at the door, he smelled the strong aroma of cooked meat. Zhao Fugui had eaten fish and eggs in his boss\u2019s house a few days ago because of the busy farming period, but he hadn\u2019t had any meat. At the moment he smelled the meat, he felt that he was drooling. The thing was, how could his family suddenly cook meat? Zhao Fugui habitually pushed the door with his hand, but didn\u2019t want to open it. He was puzzled and knocked on the door. \u201cI\u2019m back.\u201dZhao Fugui just knocked a few times and the door was opened. Before him stood Zhao Liu, who came to open the door, her eyes red and swollen.\u201cWhy are you crying? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhao Fugui asked anxiously.\u201cNothing . . . Come in and have a meal,\u201d Zhao Liu said, letting Zhao Fugui enter the house. As soon as Zhao Fugui entered the room, she immediately bolted the door, as if there were robbers outside.Zhao Fugui was confused, and it got even weirder when he saw Zhao Jinge sitting at the table that was full of dishes.There were five dishes and a soup on the table\u2014a big bowl of braised pork, a big bowl of stewed pork with dried beans, a bowl of steamed salted fish, a bowl of fried garlic, a bowl of fried pork slices with cauliflower, and a bowl of salted vegetable soup.Even during the New Year\u2019s Festival, their family would not eat so much. How much meat did they cook? Where did this meat come from?\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Zhao Fugui asked eagerly. The more he thought about it, the more he felt that the situation was not right.Hearing Zhao Fugui\u2019s question, Zhao Liu sobbed again.Zhao Fugui only felt his heart sink. This is . . . Something big happened?\u201cFugui, Jinge he . . . he . . .\u201d Zhao Liu choked up twice before she spoke again, \u201cJinge said, he likes Jiang Zhen!\u201d After that, afraid that Zhao Fugui would not understand, she added, \u201cBy the way, Jiang Zhen is Jiang Zhenwei. Jinge said that he changed his name to Jiang Zhen.\u201dAt the beginning, Zhao Liu didn\u2019t want to accept the things Jiang Zhen gave them. She thought of returning the meat and then turning down Jiang Zhen, but unexpectedly, Zhao Jinge said, he liked Jiang Zhen! Her family\u2019s Jinge unexpectedly liked that Jiang Zhen! Zhao Liu was shocked, inexplicably becoming sadder, and then ruthless. She cooked everything Jiang Zhen gave her. If it wasn\u2019t for the limited time, there would have been another kelp dish on the table.\u201cJinge likes Eldest Jiang?\u201d Zhao Fugui repeated in shock.Zhao Jinge bowed his head and felt a little sorry for his parents.\u201cWhat should I do? That Eldest Jiang, is he willing to marry our Jinge?\u201d Zhao Fugui frowned. He always hoped Jinge would marry someone he liked. After all, he himself . . . Although he didn\u2019t tell anyone about it, it was because he had fallen in love with Zhao Liu that he went to propose marriage. But that Eldest Jiang . . . the former Eldest Jiang would probably be willing to marry Zhao Jinge. But what about the current Eldest Jiang? His Jinge was probably going to be sad.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As soon as he heard that Jiang Zhen was willing to come to propose marriage, he got worried. \u201cWait a minute. Then Eldest Jiang is not a good match? Won\u2019t Jinge be wronged if he gets married to him?\u201d If Eldest Jiang went crazy, what could he do, if he beat up Zhao Jinge?\u201cNo way,\u201d Zhao Jinge whispered. Although he had been worried that Jiang Zhen would start disliking him, he was sure that Jiang Zhen was a good man. Because Jiang Zhen was so good, he was even more worried.\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even have a piece of land, nor does he have a serious business . . .\u201d The more Zhao Fugui thought about it, the more worried he got. If Zhao Jinge followed such a person, how would he live in the future?\u201cI can work,\u201d Zhao Jinge said again. He was young and strong. He could certainly support himself and his parents, and Jiang Zhen now had a boat. Even if he just caught fish and shrimps, he could always support himself. If that really didn\u2019t work . . . he could always eat less.Although Zhao Fugui was silent and taciturn, he still knew his son very well. Looking at Zhao Jinge\u2019s appearance, he knew that he was very determined. It was just that, when did his son fall in love with Eldest Jiang? Why didn\u2019t he know that his son had contact with that Eldest Jiang?Wait a minute, his son actually had a lot of contact with that Eldest Jiang . . . Zhao Fugui suddenly thought of the small fishes and shrimps his son brought home for a period of time, which were sent by Eldest Jiang. Later, when Eldest Jiang left his family, his son seemed to have broken off contact with him, but in fact . . . After that, his son still brought back some fish and shrimps and even meat, like the rabbit previously. He only thought his son was lucky to catch them, but now it seemed . . . were those things sent by Eldest Jiang?Zhao Fugui, who didn\u2019t smoke much, suddenly wanted to smoke. Eldest Jiang had planned to kidnap his Jinge! It was just . . . If his son didn\u2019t get married now, he might not be able to marry in the future, let alone marry the person Jinge himself liked.Li Zugen\u2019s family had land, but he was dragging his parents and his four children along with him. Eldest Jiang did not own any land, but in the end, he was alone . . .The house was quiet and no one spoke any longer. Finally, Zhao Jinge said, \u201cI will send some meat to Jiang Zhen.\u201dJiang Zhen bought such a piece of meat and gave it all to them. He certainly didn\u2019t have anything left to eat . . . He felt it was necessary to send some to Jiang Zhen.Zhao Jinge took a bowl of meat from the table and left home with his head down, forgetting that he had not eaten yet.Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu were both worried, and Zhao Liu started crying again. Their hard-grown cabbage was going to be eaten by a pig. No, their Jinge couldn\u2019t be called a cabbage but a tree, so . . . the tree they planted was hit by a pig?\u201cLet\u2019s eat!\u201d Zhao Fugui said. Zhao Liu had already cooked all the meat. At that moment, Zhao Fugui just wanted to eat all the meat.On the other hand, when Zhao Jinge found Jiang Zhen with the meat, Jiang Zhen had already eaten a good meal.Wang Haisheng went out with him. Because he wanted to leave more capital, he did not pay wages, but gave him food\u2014salted fish and kelp. Wang Haisheng used the salted fish to exchange for two kilos of pork in the county town. Seeing Jiang Zhen give away all the meat he bought, Wang Haisheng served Jiang Zhen a bowl after cooking the meat at home, so Jiang Zhen ate fairly well.When Zhao Jinge came, Jiang Zhen had just taken a bath and was washing clothes. He found out that he had been careless and seemed to have torn the stitching of the cuff. After washing, he needed to sew it all over again.\u201cJiang Zhen!\u201d Zhao Jinge called.\u201cZhao Jinge?\u201d Jiang Zhen was surprised to see Zhao Jinge. He had seen Zhao Fugui return home before, so he thought it was impossible for Zhao Jinge to come to him today. Unexpectedly, he saw Zhao Jinge so soon.\u201cHave you eaten yet? My mother asked me to bring you some meat.\u201d Zhao Jinge instinctively wanted to improve the relationship between his parents and Jiang Zhen.\u201cI have already eaten, but what about you? Have you eaten?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.Zhao Jinge had\u2019t eaten yet. Jiang Zhen looked at Zhao Jinge\u2019s expression and knew that he must not have eaten yet. He said, \u201cI cooked too much, can you eat here?\u201d Seeing that Zhao Jinge was about to refuse, Jiang Zhen spoke again, \u201cI have something to say to you.\u201dZhao Jinge stayed for dinner. Then Jiang Zhen started filling him in, from how he set out to the seaside to how he sold kelp in Fucheng, retelling everything for an hour before he finished.While retelling, he also held Zhao Jinge\u2019s hands and kissed them a few times.Zhao Jinge had only gone to the county town several times, so he knew nothing about the outside world and was fascinated. He didn\u2019t feel the passage of time. At the same time, he inevitably adored Jiang Zhen and looked at him with sparkling eyes.Jiang Zhen was very proud. In fact, if they really wanted to talk about it, Zhao Jinge\u2019s insight was not on the same level as his. They actually lacked a common language. But wasn\u2019t common language something that could be cultivated? So he was not worried at all. What\u2019s more, no matter who he looked for these days, they didn\u2019t share a common language with him.Zhao Jinge stayed with Jiang Zhen for more than an hour before going home. When he went back, he had an empty bowl in his hands and found that the table was empty too.\u201cHave you eaten?\u201d Zhao Fugui had been waiting for Zhao Jinge to come back for a long time, but he didn\u2019t see him return. He got angry and asked Zhao Liu to put away the food from the table. As a result, when he saw his son come back, he was worried that his son would be hungry.\u201cI have eaten,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cIt is not good to go to eat at his house without an engagement.\u201d Zhao Fugui was a little unhappy.\u201cIn fact, I have eaten there before . . .\u201d Before, Zhao Liu had been too excited, so Zhao Jinge spared her a lot of things. Now that his father and mother were both there, he finally talked about his relationship with Jiang Zhen.No wonder Zhao Jinge, who only had porridge at home, had gotten a little fatter in the past few days. It turned out that someone had been giving him an extra meal at noon. No wonder Jiang Zhen always came to feed the ducks in his family. It turned out that he had bought the ducks for Zhao Jinge.\u201cJiang Zhen really sent you food at noon every day?\u201d Zhao Fugui asked. Because Zhao Jinge emphasized several times that the name of the eldest son of the Jiangs was now Jiang Zhen, he also called him by this name.\u201cYes,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. In fact, Jiang Zhen also gave him food in the evening, but he was too embarrassed to say it.\u201cIn this way, he is not bad,\u201d Zhao Fugui said. They said that Jiang Zhen was fierce, but he just hit someone and severed relations with his parents, and he had a reason for that. Before that, the Jiang family had really gone a bit too far.Zhao Fugui was more knowledgeable than the other villagers about short-term jobs. In fact, he held some admiration for people like Jiang Zhen. Before, he was mainly worried that Jiang Zhen would be bad for Zhao Jinge, but now it seemed that . . .\u201cOur family is poor, and there is nothing to covet. I think it\u2019s because you saved his life, that he wanted to repay you for being so kind and marry you. If you think about it this way, it\u2019s good to marry him. At least, he knows how to be grateful,\u201d Zhao Fugui said again.He had heard about Li Zugen\u2019s entanglement with Zhao Jinge from Zhao Liu. After hearing this, he was really scared, breaking into a cold sweat. It was impossible that the Li family really wanted to marry his son. They probably wanted to find a strong laborer for their own family by targeting his son. In contrast, Jiang Zhen, who sent food to his son every day and didn\u2019t try involving his son in his own troubles, was sincere. Zhao Fugui\u2019s impression of Jiang Zhen got much better.At this time, Jiang Zhen found Wang Haisheng and asked him to accompany him to the county town.You just came back from the county town. Why do you want to go to the county town again? Wang Haisheng was a bit puzzled.\u201cI\u2019m going to the Zhao family\u2019s house to propose tomorrow!\u201d Jiang Zhen said. Although he planned to enter into the Zhao family, he would not just treat himself as a woman and wait for the Zhao family to ask for his hand in marriage. In his opinion, Zhao Jinge was his wife anyway. Proposing marriage . . . that is, he still had to do it! They were going to get married, so he wanted to give something to Zhao Jinge.\u201cSo it is like that.\u201d Wang Haisheng nodded and hurriedly stood up, ready to go to the county town with Jiang Zhen.\u201cWait a moment.\u201d Jiang Zhen suddenly stopped him. \u201cAsk your wife what he likes.\u201dJiang Zhen\u2019s voice was not small and Sun Xiaoshan could hear him in his room. Before Wang Haisheng could ask, he walked out slowly.Sun Xiaoshan\u2019s child was nine years old, and he was not young. Because they used to live and sleep on a fishing boat, he looked even older than other timid unmarried girls. With his head down, Sun Xiaoshan\u2019s voice was very low. \u201cBefore . . . the gers in our village all liked rouge and powder. And if they get married, they all want the same jewelry . . . It\u2019s usually a silver bracelet . . . or earrings are still good . . . It\u2019s better to pay some more. . .. A new set of clothes is also needed. The color of the clothes can be brighter. They are to be worn on the wedding day . . . Of course, it\u2019s better to give something affordable. Haisheng let me eat a chicken by myself . . .\u201dSun Xiaoshan got married more than once, but he was more impressed by the clothes and the chicken that Wang Haisheng bought for him than the jewelry and dowry money that never reached his hands. So he had a better impression of the clothes and the chicken that Wang Haisheng had bought for him. He was already so old, but he had never eaten a whole chicken by himself except for that one time!Sun Xiaoshan\u2019s voice was low but Jiang Zhen was able to hear it clearly. When hearing about makeup, Jiang Zhen scoffed. A beautiful girl looked better after dressing up, so it was normal to give cosmetics, but Zhao Jinge . . . It was hard for him to accept that Zhao Jinge, who looked like a tough man, would paint his face white. These days, makeup didn\u2019t have many colors to choose from. They only had white. So this one could be forgotten. And jewelry . . . what jewelry did big men wear? It didn\u2019t make any sense . . . Wait a moment!If he didn\u2019t buy it for Zhao Jinge, he could actually buy some for Zhao Liu!He had a comrade-in-arms who went to his girlfriend\u2019s house to meet her parents. He bought his mother-in-law a set of skin care products and a necklace for two thousand yuan. When his mother-in-law was happy, he was immediately able to marry his girlfriend!Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng rushed to the county town immediately. Because it was already dark when they got in the county town, they slept on the boat all night and went shopping in the city early the next morning.Jiang Zhen first went to the place where jewelry was sold, then after estimating the size of Zhao Liu\u2019s wrist, he exchanged the same weight of silver for a small and lovely silver bracelet, and then gave twenty copper pennies for the bracelet. After that he went to the place where rouge and powder were sold.Zhao Liu stayed at home all day and her skin was very white, so he didn\u2019t need to buy her whitening powder. He just bought a box of rouge and a few boxes of facial ointment, which she and Zhao Jinge could use. Then they went to the clothing store.Jiang Zhen took a red cloth and put it on Wang Haisheng. He found it would be a tragedy for people with darker skin to wear red clothes. After that, he gave up buying red clothes and chose some sturdy clothes for Zhao Jinge according to the color that men often wore here. Finally, thinking that he had to buy something for Zhao Fugui, Jiang Zhen went to buy a pot of wine and a few pieces of meat.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t buy many things, and no matter how ordinary the people in the village were, they also wanted to propose with such things. However, he refrained from buying too much because he wanted to save some capital for doing business.After shopping, Jiang Zhen planned to go back, but when he went by the dock, he suddenly saw many people selling chicken and ducks. Jiang Zhen always thought that the Zhao family should find a way to make a living and thought about it over and over again . . . He thought the best thing for them was to raise chicken and ducks.It was almost summer, and he still had his fishing boat. It would not be difficult to feed the chicken and ducks with snails and small fish every day. When the chicken and ducks grew up, they could sell them for money and make some profit. Thinking this way, Jiang Zhen simply bought twenty-five ducklings and five chicken in one go. Because the chicken still had to eat feed, he didn\u2019t buy more.By the time they returned to Hexi, it was already getting late, and many people had already finished their noon meal. Jiang Zhen picked up the cloth and meat he had bought at the beginning, and asked Wang Haisheng to pick up the chicken and the ducks. Accompanied by the quacking ducklings, he walked all the way to the door of the Zhao family\u2019s house, which also attracted the attention of the people in the village.What happened to this Eldest Jiang? Why is he taking this flock of chicken and ducks to the Zhao family\u2019s house?Even Zhao Liu, who came to open the door, was confused when she heard the noise. Jiang Zhen was carrying a load of clothes and meat. Although it was very ordinary clothes, a bit shabby to bring to his future relatives, it was still at least normal. What was the matter with these chicken and ducks behind him? Never mind that he had sent five ducklings to Jinge before. Why did he bring more when he came to propose marriage?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

First of all, Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu needed Zhao Jinge to provide for their old age. Although Zhao Jinge was a ger, they had only one child after all. Secondly, they planned to ask for ten silver as a betrothal gift. Of course, Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu didn\u2019t plan to take the ten silver for themselves but to give it to Zhao Jinge as a dowry he could keep at the bottom of his box . . . The main reason for them to do this was to give Zhao Jinge some security. As for the other things, they didn\u2019t have any other demands, that is, it didn\u2019t matter if Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t want to invite people to drink the wedding wine. Anyway, the Zhao family didn\u2019t have many relatives, so it was okay for them to buy the drinks themselves.As a matter of fact, they were a bit frustrated when it came to these two demands . . . If they wanted Zhao Jinge to provide for their old age, they could no longer ask for betrothal gifts. But the matter of getting married was all about discussion, so they didn\u2019t mention anything for the moment. Finally, Zhao Fugui decided to ask for the first condition first, and then everyone would discuss it slowly.After they made a decision, they felt much more relaxed. They got up early in the morning and waited for Jiang Zhen to come to their door. As a result, both Zhao Fugui and Zhao Jinge waited all morning without going to work, but Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t come. Zhao Liu was so anxious that she asked Wang Yuer, Sun Xiaoshan\u2019s eldest son, only to learn that Jiang Zhen had gone to the county town to buy some things.It seemed that Jiang Zhen attached great importance to this marriage proposal. The Zhao family simply continued to wait, and then Jiang Zhen arrived with chicken and ducks.Zhao Liu: \u201c. . .\u201dForget it. Jiang Zhen was alone and had no parents to help him. It was already good he remembered to bring something when proposing marriage. They didn\u2019t care too much about it.Zhao Liu let Jiang Zhen in the house, but as for Wang Haisheng, he was not related to him, so he put down the load he was carrying and insisted on leaving instead of going into the house.\u201cMom, Dad, I\u2019m here to propose marriage today. I hope you will wed Jinge to me,\u201d Jiang Zhen said very sincerely.Zhao Liu had always been a bit afraid of Jiang Zhen before, but now, Jiang Zhen looked so calm, she couldn\u2019t get up, and even shed some tears because of Jiang Zhen\u2019s words. Her Jinge, someone had come to propose marriage to him! This Jiang Zhen was more sincere than that Li Zugen. Well, the Li family said nice things, and they said that they really came to propose marriage, but in fact, they came here so many times but didn\u2019t even bring onions!\u201cGood, good . . .\u201d Zhao Liu wiped her tears and nodded. She wanted to say something at this point, but she didn\u2019t know what to say. She was a bit dazed.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know what to do or say at this moment, but he was a little impatient, so he simply took out the things he brought. \u201cMom, Dad, I bought you something.\u201dJiang Zhen first took out the wrapped rouge and the bracelet. After finding out that he had brought a silver bracelet, Zhao Liu was even more satisfied with him. Knowing to buy rouge and jewelry for her Jinge, Jiang Zhen seemed really attentive to him. But . . . wasn\u2019t this bracelet a bit too small? Her Jinge\u2019s wrist was a bit thick. Such a small bracelet wouldn\u2019t fit him . . . Zhao Liu was a bit confused.Jiang Zhen gave her the rouge and the bracelet. \u201cMother, this is for you.\u201dFor me? Zhao Liu was even more puzzled. This was a marriage proposal . . . There was no reason to buy things for the mother-in-law . . . Of course, the betrothal gift was given to the mother-in-law by default these days.\u201cDad, I bought you some wine. I don\u2019t know whether you\u2019ll like it or not.\u201d Jiang Zhen put the meat on the table and gave Zhao Fugui a jar of wine.Zhao Fugui had kept a straight face since Jiang Zhen entered their door, but when Jiang Zhen gave him a jar of wine, he couldn\u2019t help smiling.Finally, Jiang Zhen gave the cloth to Zhao Jinge. \u201cJinge, I bought you some cloth. It was said that you can make four sets of clothes from it. You can make two for yourself and one set for each of your parents.\u201dZhao Jinge was speechless when he took the cloth. Although it was a bit strange to give Zhao Liu rouge and jewelry and such a gray cloth to him, he was still very happy in his heart.\u201cI\u2019m doing some small business and need to save some capital, so I didn\u2019t buy much,\u201d Jiang Zhen gave the gifts and explained, but he still didn\u2019t mention those chicken and ducks. Letting the Zhao family raise the chicken and ducks, they could talk about it later.After listening to Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, the Zhao family started wondering. Did Jiang Zhen say it because he didn\u2019t want to pay the bride price? But that was impossible. The things he bought plus the bracelet were worth at least 6 or 7 silver.\u201cThere are still ten silver here. Take it.\u201d Jiang Zhen also gave ten silver to Zhao Liu. He knew that the Zhao family had no money. Before, Zhao Jinge had given all his savings to him, and they probably had even less money now. But they still needed to spend money for the marriage.He didn\u2019t want to worry about the wedding, but he couldn\u2019t let the Zhao family pay for it when they couldn\u2019t even afford to kill a pig. That would be too upsetting for Zhao Jinge.The Zhao family didn\u2019t expect that Jiang Zhen would still give the bride price. They were overjoyed for a moment, and Jiang Zhen became more pleasing to their eyes. It was just that they had to talk about providing for their old age . . .\u201cJiang Zhen, I have another thing to tell you. Jinge is our only child now, so we are going to ask him to feed us in the future,\u201d Zhao Fugui said.Their countrymen attached great importance to the care of the elderly at the end of their lives. They even thought that, if no one organized a funeral, they would suffer in the underworld after their death. So some people, even if they were too poor, they had to have sons.\u201cIt\u2019s only right. You have brought up Jinge, and of course, we will take care of you till the end,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. Zhao Fugui and his wife had raised Zhao Jinge. Of course, Zhao Jinge would take care of them until the end of their lives. There was no doubt about that. In other words, if the butcher and his wife had been a little better to Eldest Jiang, he would have also done that.Jiang Zhen agreed at once, and the Zhao family were even happier. The more they looked at Jiang Zhen, the more they liked him. There must be a reason why Eldest Jiang was so fierce before. He was obviously a person who was easy to come along with.\u201cDon\u2019t worry. We can still work. You don\u2019t need to support us now, and we can still help you with your children,\u201d Zhao Liu said. She was suddenly full of hope for the future. At the thought that she could take care of her grandson, she felt much better.\u201cYes, that\u2019s right. I can work for at least another ten years,\u201d Zhao Fugui also said.\u201cAnd the bride price, you don\u2019t need to worry. We\u2019ll let Zhao Jinge take it with him. I\u2019ve saved some money, and Jinge should also have some. We can buy a mu of land as a dowry for him, so that you can have a better life in the future,\u201d Zhao Liu also added.\u201cWait . . .\u201d Jiang Zhen interrupted Zhao Liu\u2019s words.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhao Liu asked. Doesn\u2019t Jiang Zhen want to buy land?\u201cIt\u2019s not a bride price but a dowry,\u201d Jiang Zhen said arrogantly. \u201cIn the future, I will come to your house to live. First, I will give you the dowry, and you can decide if you want to buy something. It\u2019s also good to buy land. There is nothing to lose.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Didn\u2019t Jiang Zhen come here to propose marriage? How could he say that he brought . . . a dowry? It was really strange for such a domineering person to say that it was his dowry . . .\u201cYou said . . . Are you coming to live in my house?\u201d Zhao Liu asked in disbelief.\u201cYes. Haven\u2019t you always wanted to marry in a son-in-law? What do you think of me? As a matter of fact, I wanted to come to your house for a long time, but I didn\u2019t dare to say so before,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu were simply stunned by the pies falling from the sky. When they saw Jiang Zhen bring so many things before, they thought it was good for Zhao Jinge to marry Jiang Zhen, but as a result . . . Jiang Zhen was willing to marry in? This . . . This . . . They could continue the Zhao family? They could still have grandchildren later?All of a sudden, Zhao Liu burst in tears, crying louder and louder. Zhao Fugui wanted to laugh a bit, but resisted, yet the corners of his mouth were lifted, so his expression was very strange. They were all very surprised.Zhao Jinge, on the other hand, who was still holding the rolls of cloth, looked at Jiang Zhen in shock. At first, when Jiang Zhen left the Jiang family, he wanted to marry Jiang Zhen into his family, but later, he gave up these thoughts. Yet unexpectedly . . .\u201cAhem (cough)! You don\u2019t need a dowry. We don\u2019t need it.\u201d Zhao Fugui took the silver from Zhao Liu\u2019s hands and returned it to Jiang Zhen.Zhao Liu was stunned. She soon wiped off her tears and tried to return the silver bracelet. If Jiang Zhen was willing to marry into their family, it was them who should give Jiang Zhen a bride price and buy things for him. How could they let Jiang Zhen spend his money?\u201cIt is alright. Just keep it!\u201d Jiang Zhen was impatient and pushed the things back towards them. He frowned and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have any requirements as to how the marriage is going to run. I don\u2019t mind if it is up to you.\u201dAs soon as Jiang Zhen said this aloud, Zhao Liu no longer dared to try and return the bracelet again. But looking at Jiang Zhen, her eyes became very kind. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to worry. You will have a very decent marriage.\u201d She would certainly prepare a wedding with splendor, letting Jiang Zhen have some face.\u201cGenerally, we don\u2019t have much money now,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. The little money he earned had now been spent again . . .\u201cYes, we don\u2019t have much money now, so we should save it,\u201d Zhao Liu said, immediately changing her mind. Their situation now was not good for a living. If they had the money, they might as well save it and buy some land to leave for Jinge\u2019s children, and give to Jinge\u2019s grandson in the future.\u201cWell, let\u2019s go and have dinner,\u201d Zhao Fugui said with a red face. Although Zhao Liu had cooked all the meat yesterday, he had specially saved a portion of several meat dishes for Jiang Zhen today.At first, she thought she had done a good job and prepared a good meal, but now . . . Zhao Liu regretted it very much. She shouldn\u2019t have cooked all the meat yesterday, so it could be all freshly cooked today!\u201cI\u2019ll go get two more dishes.\u201d Zhao Liu said and stood up. She was going to buy some eggs to stir-fry.\u201cMother, no need. I can\u2019t eat anymore,\u201d Jiang Zhen stopped Zhao Liu.\u201cWell, good.\u201d Zhao Liu sat down happily. Why did she think Jiang Zhen calling her mother was scary yesterday? How nice it sounded!The whole family ate together and enjoyed themselves.Jiang Zhen was hungry and was not polite, so he ate two bowls of rice in one breath. Maybe before, Zhao Liu would have secretly disliked him for eating too much when she saw him eat like that. But now, she couldn\u2019t wait for him to eat more and put more meat into his bowl. \u201cYou should eat more. Don\u2019t be polite. Make yourself at home . . . Alas, you cooked your own food for a few days. It must have been too hard. You should come to our house and eat later.\u201dJiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge were already engaged. In the countryside, it was normal for two engaged families to meet casually. So it was also okay to let Jiang Zhen come for dinner.As soon as Jiang Zhen thought about it, he nodded and agreed. He did so, not because he was too lazy to cook, but simply because he wanted to improve the food of the Zhao family. He could bring his own food and come back with some of it every day. This way he could make the Zhao family eat better, which was very good.After having a meal, the family\u2019s relationship became much closer. Jiang Zhen also explained the reason why he bought chicken and ducklings. \u201cIn the future, I will catch some fish and snails to feed the ducklings when I have free time. When the ducks grow, we can let them lay eggs and sell duck eggs, or sell them as a whole.\u201d\u201cCan this work? Can we really sell them?\u201d Zhao Liu was worried. All the families she knew in the village basically raised their own food.\u201cYes, they can be sold,\u201d Zhao Fugui said immediately. He knew that, as long as he sent them to the county town, he could certainly sell them. Thinking of this, Zhao Fugui felt a bit embarrassed. Before Jiang Zhen arrived at their home, he had already helped them make a living. He had never thought of these ways to improve their life before . . . However, they didn\u2019t have time to catch fish and shrimps to feed ducks before . . .Jiang Zhen stayed in the Zhao family\u2019s house until the sky turned black. In fact, he didn\u2019t want to go back and wished to stay, but it had not been easy to make his mother-in-law like him. In the end, he decided to put up with it for the time being. Anyway, judging from the current situation, Zhao Fugui and his wife were eager to marry him to Zhao Jinge immediately. Obviously, he wouldn\u2019t have to bear it for much longer.After Jiang Zhen left, Zhao Liu was very excited. Although it was getting dark, she was still in good spirits. She went around the house, and then called Zhao Jinge. She said she would go to the river to wash all the dirty clothes at home and then catch some snails to feed the ducks.In fact, there was no need to hurry . . . Zhao Jinge wanted to persuade his mother, but now, he also wanted to do something to calm down . . . so the two of them went to the river to wash their clothes.The people who had been watching the Zhao family naturally saw this scene, as well as Zhao Liu\u2019s red and swollen eyes. This . . . They didn\u2019t know what Eldest Jiang had done to the Zhaos to make Zhao Liu cry so bitterly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They even cut firewood to boil water to let her wash the clothes and dishes. And today . . .\u201d\u201cZhao Liu\u2019s eyes were red from crying. She was probably driven out by Eldest Jiang.\u201d\u201cThat Zhao Jinge looks dazed and is probably frightened. No matter how much he looks like a man, in fact, he is still a ger.\u201d\u201cThat Eldest Jiang . . . ah!\u201d. . .At that time, all the people in the village had already gotten off work and had nothing to do, so they chatted with other people from the village, and there was no doubt that the main topic of their conversations was Zhao Fugui\u2019s family.That Eldest Jiang took a fancy to Zhao Jinge. They didn\u2019t know how the Zhao family would live in the future.The people in the village avoided Zhao Liu and Zhao Jinge while they were chatting. Therefore, Zhao Liu and Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t know what they thought so far.Despite the fact that Zhao Liu\u2019s eyes were very red and swollen, she was very happy and satisfied at this moment. Since the death of her eldest son, she had become a subject of sympathy for the village, making her more and more reluctant to go out. But now . . . she felt that she was ready to lift her head up.When Zhao Liu came out to wash clothes, she had the intention to show off in front of the other villagers. As a result, she was there washing clothes and waiting for the others to ask her about her family, but no one came to ask. Even those who were washing dishes by the river gave her sympathetic looks before leaving without a word.Zhao Liu became so gloomy that she wanted to hold back these people and tell them that her family\u2019s Jinge was going to get married and it was a marriage into their house. But with her character, she wouldn\u2019t do that kind of thing, so she could only get more ensnared. Her heart was both happy and confused. Zhao Liu put a lot of effort into washing the clothes, but Zhao Jinge was the complete opposite.After Jiang Zhen said something like that, he was a bit dazed and didn\u2019t know what to do. Especially . . . Jiang Zhen even went so far as to say that he had wanted to live in his house for a long time. Did Jiang Zhen fall in love with him a long time ago? Even though he was not confident at this time, Zhao Jinge still believed that Jiang Zhen liked him. After thinking of this, he felt so happy that his heart could almost jump out of his chest. Zhao Jinge suddenly felt that rescuing Jiang Zhen from the river and then bringing him porridge to keep him alive were the best things he had ever done in his life.\u201cHow agile Zhao Jinge used to be. He is not moving now.\u201d\u201cThe way Zhao Liu washed these clothes seemed like she wanted to tear them up.\u201d\u201cI guess they feel unwell. How pitiful . . .\u201d. . .The villagers felt more sympathetic towards the Zhao family\u2019s plight. Although they liked to watch how others lived and gossiped about them sometimes, no one would dare go out and rub salt into the wound of the Zhao family when they felt really sorry for them. So . . . Zhao Liu finished washing her clothes with no one coming up to her to inquire about Jiang Zhen\u2019s and Zhao Jinge\u2019s situation. Zhao Liu\u2019s heart became depressed, but in the end, she could only go back home in frustration. However, when she saw what Jiang Zhen had given her, she felt happy again.In the past, when they got married, Zhao Fugui had also given her a bracelet. But later, when the family was short of money, the bracelet was naturally sold, so that she did not have any jewelry anymore. But now, she had another bracelet.\u201cFugui, this bracelet is much prettier than the one you bought for me.\u201d Zhao Liu put the bracelet on her wrist and showed it to Zhao Fugui.\u201cMy bracelet was bigger!\u201d Zhao Fugui said discontentedly. He had bought the biggest bracelet he could afford!\u201cIt was big, but not beautiful!\u201d Zhao Liu said. That bracelet was so clumsily made and so thick that it was inconvenient for her to wear it to work, so she didn\u2019t wear it very often in the end. Although the bracelet given by Jiang Zhen was a bit small, it was small and beautiful, and just right. Zhao Liu looked at the bracelet, and the more she looked, the more she liked it.Seeing the scene before him, Zhao Fugui\u2019s face turned black. His wife was going to show off the things given by others?However, Zhao Liu didn\u2019t notice and kept praising Jiang Zhen. She took out the rouge that Jiang Zhen had given and with her fingers applied some on her lips. Then she asked Zhao Fugui if it looked good.It was already a dark night. What was there to see! Zhao Fugui snorted twice. In fact, Jiang Zhen had neither taste, nor money, so when he was choosing rouge for Zhao Liu, he chose not only the most common but also the cheapest one. If it were the modern times and he were to give the future mother-in-law the cheapest lipstick, he wouldn\u2019t be able to marry their daughter. But in ancient times, Zhao Liu didn\u2019t even have a box of rouge. So even with such a box of rouge, she still liked it.Zhao Fugui\u2019s face got even darker. If he had known that Zhao Liu liked these things that could not be eaten or used at all, he would have spent money to buy a box for her! But . . . if he had given this thing to Zhao Liu before, Zhao Liu would have been angry with him for spending money recklessly.After Zhao Liu reluctantly wiped off the rouge from her lips and went to bed, she kept talking about Jiang Zhen. On the other side, Zhao Jinge was also thinking about Jiang Zhen.Will Jiang Zhen come over tonight?Zhao Jinge was restless, fearing that Jiang Zhen would not come over because he thought he was already asleep. In the end he opened the window and waited. In fact, he had opened the window last night too and waited, hoping that Jiang Zhen would come over. In the end, he waited all night, but Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t come. Later, he fell asleep while in a daze. Because of that, when he woke up in the morning, he was really nervous. He was afraid that Jiang Zhen had just said it casually, but in fact, he didn\u2019t plan to come to his family to propose marriage that day. The worry he was bearing was not relieved until he learned from Wang Yuer that Jiang Zhen had gone to the county town. At that time, his heart had dropped to the ground, but it was still beating very fast.If Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t come to ask for a reward and take advantage of it this evening, he would not be Jiang Zhen. Thinking that he had dropped a bomb at the Zhaos\u2019 house today, he thought that Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu would be too excited and would go to sleep late, so he didn\u2019t dare to come early and finally showed up much later than usual.When he came over, he was worried that Zhao Jinge had already fallen asleep, and so, he didn\u2019t immediately see the open window.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 55": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 45.2 - Fragile bed boardPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45.2 \u2013 Fragile bed boardJiang Zhen easily entered Zhao Jinge\u2019s house and closed the window.\u201cZhao Jinge, did you miss me?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked in a low voice, throwing himself on the bed and pressing Zhao Jinge down.Zhao Jinge was startled by Jiang Zhen. As soon as the other landed on his body, his already unstable bed board suddenly made a creaking sound, which startled both of them.\u201cYou . . . get out of the way.\u201d Feeling that Jiang Zhen\u2019s whole body was lying on him, Zhao Jinge\u2019s face turned red at a speed visible to the naked eye.This . . . This. . . This position was not right!\u201cThis is good . . . If I move now, the bed will also move,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. Zhao Jinge\u2019s bed was only made of wood, and its quality was so poor that it would creak whenever he turned over. Speaking of which, they had better get a solid bed before getting married; otherwise, it would be too inconvenient for him to do things in the future.Zhao Jinge flushed and didn\u2019t dare to move. Jiang Zhen bowed his head and kissed him on the mouth.In the past, Jiang Zhen kissed Zhao Jinge a lot, but he always kissed him very mildly. No matter how many kisses he stole, he would not do much. He would just lie on the bed with Zhao Jinge and, at most, touch a little, which was within Zhao Jinge\u2019s tolerance. But this time, Jiang Zhen put his tongue in Zhao Jinge\u2019s mouth.Zhao Jinge lay quietly and was kissed by Jiang Zhen. As a result, instead of kissing him casually as usual, Jiang Zhen bit and licked his lips. Jiang Zhen had also licked him before, so after being licked, Zhao Jinge still didn\u2019t move. But then, Jiang Zhen suddenly pried open his mouth with his tongue and stuck his tongue into his mouth.This . . . This. . . What is Jiang Zhen doing?Zhao Jinge was confused and subconsciously tried to close his mouth, but then, he accidentally bit Jiang Zhen\u2019s tongue.This was also the first time for Jiang Zhen to give someone a french kiss. While he was working hard, he got bitten. At that moment, he gave a hiss and lay on the other side.Bang! The bed board suddenly made a loud sound, and it seemed like another piece had cracked? Jiang Zhen looked at the obviously broken bed under his knees, and the corners of his mouth jerked up.\u201cJinge, what was that?\u201d Zhao Liu couldn\u2019t sleep at that time. When she heard movement in her son\u2019s room, she couldn\u2019t help but shout her concern.\u201cMother, I\u2019m fine. It\u2019s just . . . I couldn\u2019t fall asleep,\u201d Zhao Jinge said, holding Jiang Zhen\u2019s hand and feeling very guilty. Why did he bite Jiang Zhen? Jiang Zhen had not been bitten by him, had he?Zhao Jinge dealt with Zhao Liu and was about to check on Jiang Zhen\u2019s situation when he was gagged again. He didn\u2019t dare to move this time, fearing that he might accidentally bite Jiang Zhen again, so he just lay there silently and let Jiang Zhen\u2019s tongue run rampant in his mouth.Jiang Zhen, this guy actually drank my saliva, this . . . Is this bad?Zhao Jinge felt a little bad, but there was no denying that he liked this feeling. Jiang Zhen treated him like this, which made him feel cherished and loved by Jiang Zhen. Although Jiang Zhen\u2019s tongue was bitten, Zhao Jinge had been merciful after all, so it didn\u2019t matter. Now he could kiss Zhao Jinge all over.Zhao Jinge\u2019s body became stiff, and he stopped breathing several times. It was really interesting . . . Originally, Jiang Zhen was very worried about his own poor skills, but now, he suddenly realized that he didn\u2019t have to worry at all. Compared to Zhao Jinge, who didn\u2019t know anything, his skills were absolutely excellent!Jiang Zhen had been very busy for a few days, and now, he was more or less tired. Not to mention that it was impossible for him to finish what he started with Zhao Jinge now. So when he had enough kisses, he said, \u201cLet\u2019s sleep.\u201d After saying that, he turned over and really fell asleep immediately.He had been sleeping on the boat for a few days, but he was still somehow unaccustomed to it, and now, he finally got in a solid bed! Although the bed board broke, this bed was made from more than ten pieces of bed boards put together; the damage was not great.Jiang Zhen slept very well, unlike Zhao Jinge. He was so troubled by Jiang Zhen that he couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Zhao Jinge, who couldn\u2019t sleep, lay in the bed for a long time before finally closing his eyes.The next day, early in the morning, Zhao Jinge was awakened by Zhao Liu knocking on the door.\u201cJinge, get up quickly and call Jiang Zhen for a meal,\u201d Zhao Liu shouted outside the house.Zhao Jinge suddenly woke up, and then looked into Jiang Zhen\u2019s eyes. Jiang Zhen also woke up beside him at the same time.\u201cJinge, get up quickly. Why are you getting up so late today? What if Jiang Zhen is hungry?\u201d Zhao Liu shouted again. \u201cGo and call him!\u201dZhao Jinge: \u201c. . .\u201dJiang Zhen: \u201c. . .\u201dIn the end, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t dare to open the door and directly go for breakfast, so he secretly climbed out of the window, went back to his house and waited for Zhao Jinge to call him for a meal. It was so much trouble. He wished he could get married soon.Because Zhao Liu knew that Jiang Zhen would come to have a meal with them later, the porridge made that morning was very thick, and she also specially cooked two dishes.She usually had a lot of free time, so she had time to cook. In a situation where oil and salt were lacking, her food was much better than that made by Jiang Zhen. For example, the pickled lettuce was crispy and appetizing.Jiang Zhen drank two bowls of porridge in one breath and insisted on moving his own food to the Zhao family\u2019s house. He also left some salted fish and kelp for Zhao Liu, then he called Wang Haisheng and went out with him.When he went out, Zhao Liu cut the vegetable leaves and started feeding the chicken and the ducklings. She also added some water to the remaining porridge and gave it to them.These chicken and ducks could be sold for money when they grew up. She must take good care of them!Zhao Liu was full of energy as she thought that what she was doing was for her future grandson. Zhao Fugui and Zhao Jinge were also motivated. Thinking that it would be best to earn more money for the bride price, Zhao Jinge and Zhao Fugui went out to work early in the morning.When everyone was gone, Zhao Liu was left to take care of the flock of ducks. At this time, someone who had a good relationship with her finally came to visit.As soon as the man walked in, he went to poke Zhao Liu\u2019s scar and asked, \u201cDid you get these ducks from Eldest Jiang?\u201d\u201cYes,\u201d Zhao Liu nodded.\u201cWhy are you . . . raising ducks for Eldest Jiang?\u201d the man asked again. He didn\u2019t think Jiang Zhen would be kind enough to give Zhao Liu a gaggle of ducklings. He guessed that Jiang Zhen had just asked Zhao Liu to help him raise them.\u201cYes,\u201d Zhao Liu nodded. The man\u2019s words were right. She was really raising ducks for Jiang Zhen. What she and Zhao Fugui had would all belong to Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge in the future. \u201cI tell you, Jiang Zhen is really nice. Just yesterday he was\u2014\u201d When Zhao Liu was about to raise her hand, wanting to show off the bracelet on her wrist, Jiang Zhen came back with two buckets.When the person, who was originally talking to Zhao Liu, saw Jiang Zhen, he ran away quickly and did not hear what Zhao Liu said later. Zhao Liu, who originally wanted to show off, could only watch the man run away . . .\u201cMother, I went to the river to get some snails and small fish,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Everyone had gotten up early. Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng went to work on the boat at about seven o\u2019clock and spent about three or four hours catching fish. Wang Haisheng\u2019s two children were helping them put snails in a bucket on the shore.The adult ducks could swallow the snails in their stomachs and digest them, but the small ducklings couldn\u2019t do it. Zhao Liu had to smash them with a stone before they could be fed to the ducklings. These snails could only be used as feed for a period of time. Now the five newly matured ducks were no longer small and could only be fed small fish intestines, but they needed to be cut up beforehand.Zhao Liu took a look and discovered that Jiang Zhen had brought back a bucket of snails and a bucket of small fish. She was so happy that she forgot that she wanted to show off.\u201cYou just leave it here. I\u2019ll clean it up right away. Ah, I have to wait before cleaning it up. I\u2019ll cook first.\u201dBecause of Jiang Zhen\u2019s presence, Zhao Liu, who did not cook lunch before, was going to prepare lunch now. She also planned to make it a bit richer.At noon, after Jiang Zhen ate two bowls of rice with the meat left unfinished the day before, and several vegetarian dishes that were newly cooked by Zhao Liu, he asked Zhao Liu to pack a bowl of rice and a bowl of vegetables, saying that he would give them to Zhao Jinge.Zhao Liu was deeply moved and overjoyed. Jiang Zhen was attentive to her Jinge. He would certainly have a good life in the future, so she would be able to rest assured! The next day, she would go and ask the blind man in the next village to see what the nearest suitable day for marriage was. It would be better to take care of this marriage as soon as possible.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 46 - Someone climbed in through the windowPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 46 \u2013 Someone climbed in through the windowJiang Zhen didn\u2019t deliberately avoid people when he went to deliver food to Zhao Jinge this time. However, Zhao Dahu\u2019s house was close to the canal, and the land there all belonged to him, so there were generally no other villagers.Zhao Jinge had been working all morning and was already a bit tired, but when he saw Jiang Zhen, he felt refreshed again, and the corners of his mouth pulled up unconsciously. He used to secretly eat the rice brought by Jiang Zhen in the woods, but this time, he sat on the ridge of the field and ate it, hoping that others could see them and know that Jiang Zhen was kind to him. However, even if someone saw them, they soon learned that Jiang Zhen had eaten at the Zhao family\u2019s house just then. He did deliver food to Zhao Jinge, but this food was from the Zhao family . . . wasn\u2019t it generosity at the expense of others? Nobody envied Zhao Jinge at all.Zhao Jinge was just as upset as Zhao Liu, but Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t take it seriously. He never cared about other people\u2019s gazes. If he had time to care about what the other villagers were thinking, he might as well use this time to make more money. This was not the modern and peaceful society. In modern times, even if one was poor, they could seek out one of those shelters for food. Here, if you didn\u2019t have money on your hands, you might starve to death. With so little money on hand, he couldn\u2019t feel at ease.\u201cI\u2019m going to the county town this afternoon,\u201d seeing that Zhao Jinge had almost finished eating, Jiang Zhen said to him.\u201cTo do what?\u201d Zhao Jinge was a bit confused.\u201cTo sell things. Don\u2019t worry. I will be back in the evening.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled at Zhao Jinge.What Jiang Zhen wanted to sell in the county town was his remaining salted fish and kelp, as well as the fish he had just caught this morning. He had this plan for a long time. The kelp was soaked yesterday and the goods were ready. After greeting Zhao Jinge, he took Wang Haisheng with him.When they arrived at the county town, they were just in time for the evening market in the afternoon. At this time, many people had dinner at four or five o\u2019clock in the afternoon, but before that, some of them would go to the street to buy food.Jiang Zhen stopped the boat near the dock and started selling a bowl of kelp for a penny, just as he had done in Fucheng before.There were fewer people in the county town than in Fucheng, but there were still people who came to buy a bowl of kelp. After all, one penny was really a small amount. Once there were more people who came to buy, others naturally would come to have a look, even if they didn\u2019t actually plan to buy. Now that they had come to see, some of them had to buy the prepared kelp.Most people came to buy kelp, but some people bought the more expensive salted fish and fresh fish sold as well \u2026In modern times, sea fish was sold frozen, but freshwater fish was sold alive. After all, the taste of dead fish was not good for it would be very fishy, but it was different in the ancient times.At present, people basically sold freshly killed fish. They caught the fish and sold it on the street. Even if the fishes were still alive at the beginning, they would die soon, and there was nothing they could do about it. At present, it was not like in the modern society, where water came out when you turned on a faucet. There were no oxygen pumps, that could pump oxygen into the water to keep the fish alive, or big buckets . . .If you got a big bucket to sell live fish these days, it would be very troublesome to move it around. As a result, except for some rich people, who paid more attention to it, most people bought and sold dead fish.But Jiang Zhen still sold live fish. The live fish that he and Wang Haisheng had caught this morning wasn\u2019t piled on their boat but kept in a fishing net. It ensured that the fish wouldn\u2019t die. When they arrived in the county town, they took the fishes out and sold them in buckets one by one. At that time, the fishes were still alive. Wang Haisheng dealt with the sales of kelp, and Jiang Zhen was in charge of selling salted fish and fresh fish, the prices of which were more troublesome to calculate.There were many people interested in fresh live fish. After a while, it sold very well.Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng were the first people to sell live fish and kelp this way in the country town, so there were many people who bought from them. After selling all afternoon, they ended with a profit of three silver, which meant they had earned another three silver.Although kelp sold more, the money was mainly made by the sale of fish since the price of kelp was lower, and the price of salted fish was higher. If they really wanted to make money, kelp was presumably better for business.\u201cIs it you?\u201d When a voice asked this question, Jiang Zhen raised his head and found out that a sea merchant, who had gone with them to purchase goods, was standing in front of them.\u201cThat\u2019s a good way to sell it.\u201d The seafood merchant looked at the kelp in front of Wang Haisheng with a thoughtful look. There was no doubt that when he got back, he would follow suit and sell it like this. This method was too simple and could be learned easily. Jiang Zhen knew that he had better find a way to do some other business in the future. Of course, he had to have the capital first.\u201cHow are your goods doing?\u201d the seafood merchant asked again.\u201cSold out,\u201d Jiang Zhen finally answered.Hearing this, the merchant looked at Jiang Zhen with surprise. The profits from sea goods were OK, but they didn\u2019t make much money because they couldn\u2019t sell too much at once. But the goods bought by these two people had been sold out?This sea merchant was a bit jealous, but he couldn\u2019t do anything else except for feeling jealous. He didn\u2019t want to row his boat to sell somewhere else. Jiang Zhen had been selling all afternoon in the county town. The rest of the sea goods were almost sold out. If we sell them again tomorrow, he estimated, we will probably sell them all. He packed his things and went back to Hexi before it got completely dark.When Jiang Zhen arrived at the Zhao family\u2019s house, it was past the time when the Zhao family used to have dinner, but the Zhao family still hadn\u2019t moved their chopsticks. When they saw Jiang Zhen come back, Zhao Liu brought out all the dishes that were put on the steaming rack to keep warm, and then called Jiang Zhen to have dinner.Zhao Liu was an introverted and careful person and was also willing to devote herself to cooking. Now was a good time to eat garlic. Of course, this garlic didn\u2019t refer to cloves, but to the green garlic.Zhao Liu pulled out some garlic, cut off the roots, steamed it with the salted fish, cut the garlic leaves into small pieces, and made a bowl of bean curd with garlic leaves. In addition, she also mixed kelp with cold sauce, fried a plate of cabbage, and even . . .\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked curiously at the dish on the table, which was a plate of fried wild vegetables, but there seemed to be something else in it.\u201cI picked some snails and took off their shells to fry them with wild vegetables,\u201d Zhao Liu said. She saw that there were many snails, and cooked some of them, picking out all the snail meat, piece by piece, with a needle. She fed the tails of the snails to the ducklings, but the heads of the snails were gathered for cooking, which could be regarded as adding some meat to their dishes.Jiang Zhen used to eat snails with his comrades as a night snack, but they all cut the tail of the whole snail and sucked the meat out themselves. He had never eaten snail heads cooked like this. This was definitely a time consuming project.\u201cThe snails were relatively small. If there were field snails, there would be more meat.\u201d Zhao Liu also said that the snails in the river here were only the size of a nail, but the snails in the paddy field could get as big as chicken eggs, so there was more meat.Jiang Zhen was particularly satisfied with this meal. After he traveled to the ancient times, he had been eating pretty well in general. But until then, he had not eaten delicious food. He immediately felt that it was a correct decision to come to the Zhaos\u2019 house for dinner. When he makes more money in the future, he must buy more seasonings for Zhao Liu.After dinner, it was already completely dark, so the Zhao family lit a small oil lamp. But they still couldn\u2019t see clearly, and this being the case, it became difficult to chat, so Jiang Zhen soon said his goodbyes.That night, Jiang Zhen slipped into Zhao Jinge\u2019s room once again.\u201cThe bed board hasn\u2019t been changed yet?\u201d touching the bed, Jiang Zhen asked.Zhao Jinge was stunned and then felt a bit embarrassed. \u201cI forgot . . .\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t want to change it, don\u2019t. In a few days, I\u2019ll get some wood and make a sturdier bed. Otherwise, it will be too inconvenient,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Zhao Jinge was not completely unaware of this matter. But after hearing Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, he immediately blushed. When he came back from work the next day, he took down the broken bed board from his house and checked the rest of the bed boards again.\u201cThe bed board was so good. Why did it break so suddenly? There are no termites.\u201d Zhao Liu looked at the bed board a little puzzled.Zhao Jinge looked down and said awkwardly, \u201cI accidentally used too much force . . .\u201d\u201cYes, this bed board has been used for a long time after all,\u201d Zhao Liu said. \u201cBy the way, Jinge, your father and I already had dinner. When Jiang Zhen comes back, you two can have a good meal together. You don\u2019t have to wait for us or leave us food.\u201d\u201cMom, what are you doing?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked.Zhao Liu said happily, \u201cWe are going to the next village to find the blind man to ask for a suitable day for your marriage.\u201d When choosing a date for an auspicious day of the zodiac, they had to ask a person who could count these days, and they were generally all blind. The master was blind, and the disciples he took in were blind as well. In fact, this was also a way for those who were blind to live.\u201cHmmm,\u201d Zhao Jinge answered.\u201cWe may not come back tonight. Your father has a friend over there, so we may stay there for one night,\u201d Zhao Liu said again. Apart from asking the blind man for an auspicious day of the zodiac, she and Zhao Fugui also would go there to order two quilts and several pieces of furniture. Zhao Fugui\u2019s friend was a carpenter, and if they were delayed for too long, they would not come back but rest at his house for a night.Zhao Jinge answered again, and Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui went out together.The people in the village they went to didn\u2019t know much about Hexi. At most, they heard a few rumors about Eldest Jiang. So when Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui went to ask for an auspicious day, the blind man was very calm and gave them three dates. Generally, when people came to ask about a date for marriage, they would all choose an auspicious day in several months, but the Zhao family had already stressed out that sooner was better, so the blind man had given them three dates, one was twelve days later, one was a month later, and the last one was two months later.Zhao Liu wrote down these three dates, but she had already made up her mind to marry Zhao Jinge and Jiang Zhen in twelve days. It was better to get married as soon as possible. What if Jiang Zhen runs away?Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui asking for dates went very smoothly, and ordering the two quilts also went very smoothly, but when it was time to finally order some furniture, they encountered a bit of trouble. It was already dark, and it was hard to walk during the night as they might encounter snakes. However, Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui still went back.\u201cWhat happened to that friend of yours? He thinks of us as being too poor? Unexpectedly, he drove us out without even saying a few words . . .\u201d Zhao Liu looked at Zhao Fugui with dissatisfaction.She and Zhao Fugui felt that they could not wrong Jiang Zhen, so they went to find friends to make two kinds of furniture. As soon as they entered the door, they told them that their Jinge was going to marry. The wife of Zhao Fugui\u2019s friend couldn\u2019t wait to drive them out, and Zhao Fugui\u2019s friend didn\u2019t stop them either. Zhao Liu felt extremely depressed. Zhao Fugui was also silent.\u201cAren\u2019t they just afraid that we will borrow money from them? We\u2019ve never thought about it. We sold the land a long time ago, and we still didn\u2019t bother them . . . \u201c Zhao Liu said again.She and Zhao Fugui didn\u2019t want to trouble people. In fact, they could borrow money at the beginning, but later, after they sold the land, they felt it was not good to borrow money from people, who were not relatives, without reason.For so many years, they never bothered them. This time, they also brought money for new furniture but were unexpectedly kicked out. Zhao Fugui was also upset. His friend had a distant family relationship with him. When he was young, they had a very good relationship. They helped each other a lot, but now, the man turned his head and didn\u2019t give him any face. It was just that Zhao Fugui was not very good at talking, so he could only remain silent.\u201cI\u2019ll find another carpenter tomorrow. The bed board in Jinge\u2019s room was broken by him carelessly. Everything else can wait, but the bed must be bought quickly,\u201d Zhao Liu said, suddenly frowning again. She looked in the distance. \u201cFugui, why is there light in Jinge\u2019s room?\u201dZhao Fugui looked from afar and found out that there was light in his son\u2019s room, and the window was still open.\u201cThis child is not afraid of using up the lamp oil,\u201d Zhao Liu said with some heartache.Zhao Fugui was vaguely aware that something was wrong. His family\u2019s Jinge was not one of those who would keep the lights on at night. He pulled Zhao Liu with him and didn\u2019t go any further. He was thinking about something when suddenly, he saw a figure climbing in through the window and then the window closed.This . . . This . . . Zhao Fugui was shocked. Zhao Liu was also startled. How could someone get into Jinge\u2019s room?\u201cLet\u2019s walk lightly.\u201d Zhao Fugui\u2019s face was black. He was almost sure he knew who had climbed in through the window, and it made him particularly uncomfortable! They were not married yet!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He went fishing with Wang Haisheng early in the morning. After catching fish, he went to the county town with Wang Haisheng and sold the live fish while selling the leftover seafood.On that day, they sold another two silver worth of goods. They sold almost all the fish and the seafood, which was worrisome. After all of the goods had been sold, he had nearly thirty-two silver in capital that he had made. Jiang Zhen thought about waiting until his marriage, before he would go to sea in order to see if there were any other businesses he could do.When he returned to the Zhao family\u2019s house in the evening, Jiang Zhen told Zhao Jinge about his plan and also flirted with him. Because Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui could come back, Jiang Zhen went back to his residence after dinner. It was not until it was clear that Zhao Fugui and his wife wouldn\u2019t return, that he went to the Zhao family\u2019s house again after waiting for an hour.This day, Zhao Fugui and his wife were not at home. When they met, they didn\u2019t have to be afraid to speak like before. Finally, they lay side by side and said a lot of things. As they were talking, Jiang Zhen mentioned something. When he was picking up clams with Wang Haisheng at the seaside, he picked up some pretty shells on the way, but forgot about them, and hadn\u2019t brought them to Zhao Jinge as of yet.Zhao Jinge had not seen seashells before and was very interested in them. Jiang Zhen immediately got up from the bed and went home to fetch them. Although Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu had recognized the relationship between Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge, Jiang Zhen still couldn\u2019t talk affectionately or give gifts to Zhao Jinge in the daytime, so it was better to give some things at night.Zhao Jinge thought it was troublesome, but Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t think so at all, so he left to get the shells while Zhao Jinge lit a lamp and waited for him in his room.In the middle of the night, there was no one in the village, so they didn\u2019t think that they would be seen, but . . .Zhao Fugui held Zhao Liu\u2019s hand in the dark, feeling a bit angry. He hoped that Zhao Jinge would marry Jiang Zhens soon. After all, he was very satisfied with Jiang Zhen, but even so, he was still annoyed to see Jiang Zhen climbing in through his child\u2019s window.This Jiang Zhen unexpectedly . . . Couldn\u2019t he just wait for a few more days!At that time, Zhao Liu had already returned to her senses and got angry. Her Jinge hadn\u2019t married Jiang Zhen yet. How could Jiang Zhen do this?!As they walked towards their house, Zhao Liu\u2019s thoughts became more and more tangled. It suddenly occurred to her that there was one night she could not sleep, and she saw Jiang Zhen wandering around her home . . . At that time, she thought Jiang Zhen wanted to steal things from her family. But now it seems that . . . Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t come to steal things but to kidnap people! No wonder Jinge always spoke for him at that time!The more Zhao Liu thought about it, the more depressed she became. Then she remembered another thing . . . Today, Jinge took a broken bed board out of his room, and there was still movement in Jinge\u2019s room the night before yesterday . . .Jinge\u2019s sleeping posture was always very good. How could he crush the bed board? So . . . their family\u2019s ger had been unexpectedly flirted with . . . Zhao Liu\u2019s mood was very complicated. How could Jiang Zhen do that? What if they begot children? The spit of the villagers could drown her Jinge! However, there were some people in her family for whom others would climb in through the window in the middle of the night . . . Zhao Liu did not know why, but she was still a little happy even though she was angry.At this time, Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui had already reached Zhao Jinge\u2019s window.\u201cJinge, kiss me and I\u2019ll give it to you,\u201d Jiang Zhen said to Zhao Jinge while holding a shell in his hand. He was actually a very vigilant person, but he was now sitting on Zhao Jinge\u2019s bed and hugging Zhao Jinge around his waist. If he could still be alert as usual under such circumstances, he would really be a saint. Of course, he couldn\u2019t be a saint. Cough. He was already hard at the moment . . .Zhao Jinge had been very generous towards Jiang Zhen ever since his parents agreed to his marriage to Jiang Zhen. Now Jiang Zhen asked him to kiss him, so he really kissed him. However, Jiang Zhen was still a little dissatisfied. \u201cYou can\u2019t kiss like this. Kiss and stick out your tongue.\u201d Jiang Zhen was good at seducing.Before Zhao Jinge could move, his window was suddenly knocked on, and Zhao Fugui coughed outside. Zhao Jinge, who was thinking about whether to listen to Jiang Zhen\u2019s words and kiss him, froze, and even Jiang Zhen was a bit frightened.He went to his future wife\u2019s room in the middle of the night and was caught by his future father-in-law and mother-in-law . . . This was definitely something that would annoy his father-in-law.Jiang Zhen was sent out of the Zhao family\u2019s house. Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu didn\u2019t say a word to him, but he still felt that he might be unlucky. His hunch was right. After inviting Jiang Zhen out, Zhao Fugui and his wife sat in front of Zhao Jinge and started interrogating him.\u201cWhen did it start?\u201d\u201cLast month . . .\u201d Zhao Jinge said.Last month, before Jiang Zhen went out to sell seafood . . . Their son and Jiang Zhen, unexpectedly . . . Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu were silent. They were very satisfied with Jiang Zhen before, but now . . .\u201cIt\u2019s too soon to get married in twelve days. It is better to do it two months later,\u201d Zhao Fugui said.Zhao Liu also nodded in agreement. \u201cYes, marriage cannot be too hasty. It is better to wait two months.\u201dThe two made up their minds, but after a while, Zhao Liu said again, \u201cTwo months is too long. Too many things can happen . . .\u201d\u201cOne month. They will get married in one month\u2019s time,\u201d Zhao Fugui said. He couldn\u2019t help but look at Zhao Jinge\u2019s belly . . . Even if there is one, it can\u2019t be seen in another month\u2019s time, right?The next day, Jiang Zhen was told by Zhao Liu, who had hoped to marry Zhao Jinge in a few days, that their marriage would be a month later. At the same time, Zhao Liu also said that, before the marriage, the couple should not meet, so after that, she would not let Jiang Zhen come to their house to eat. That was to say, she would deliver the food to Zhao Jinge herself at noon.As for the evening . . . Zhao Liu said that she wanted to teach Zhao Jinge something, and she would sleep on the bamboo couch in Zhao Jinge\u2019s room. At the time the weather was already hot. Even if one wore a single garment, one wouldn\u2019t freeze. So there was no problem with sleeping on the bamboo couch.Jiang Zhen: \u201c. . .\u201d He had known this. He should have endured that night. It was said that he could get married in twelve days, but it suddenly became a month, and he couldn\u2019t see Zhao Jinge during that time. A whole month, how could he live to this day? However, he also understood Zhao Fugui and his wife. If he had a daughter and a jerk ended up climbing in through his daughter\u2019s window, he would certainly be very angry and unhappy. He wouldn\u2019t even be so calm and would probably catch that son of a bitch and beat him up.Speaking of which, had it not been for his sincere door-to-door courtship, Zhao Fugui and his wife would have never been so talkative and would have given him food in all colors and flavors every day.After eating all the food Zhao Liu sent, Jiang Zhen thought about it and decided that it would be better for him to go out again. Now that he couldn\u2019t eat Zhao Jinge\u2019s tofu or even see him, he might as well go out to do some business and earn some money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He just wanted it to be strong and durable, so he bought some coarse cloth for Zhao Jinge. But later, when he thought about it . . . If they got married and didn\u2019t have any better clothes to wear, it would wrong Zhao Jinge.Jiang Zhen had always been a person who, after making his decision, would act on it immediately. After making such a decision, he immediately found Zhao Fugui and his wife, and told them that he wanted to go and sell some more seafood.\u201cYou are about to get married . . .\u201d Zhao Liu was a bit hesitant. Before, when Jiang Zhen left on a long travel, she didn\u2019t care, but now she couldn\u2019t help worrying. It was so dangerous out there! In the past, some people in their village went far away, but never came back.\u201cThere is still a month until then. And I am going to do business and make money in the future. Even if I don\u2019t go this time, I will go out in a few days,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Zhao Liu looked at Jiang Zhen and was worried that Jiang Zhen was upset because she and Zhao Fugui didn\u2019t let him meet Zhao Jinge. So he decided to say it out.\u201cJiang Zhen, these days . . .\u201d\u201cIt was my fault before. I should have behaved much better,\u201d Jiang Zhen apologized. It was not proper for him to climb in through the window. If it wasn\u2019t Zhao Fugui and his wife, who saw him, he was afraid that Zhao Jinge would suffer from the gossip.Zhao Liu took a look at Jiang Zhen and said, \u201cGo and talk to Jinge.\u201d She didn\u2019t want to stop Jiang Zhen from getting closer to Zhao Jinge, but they weren\u2019t married yet . . .Jiang Zhen went to see Zhao Jinge and told him that he was leaving for a period of time. Then the next day, he left with Wang Haisheng.Wang Haisheng followed Jiang Zhen and had no salary for the time being, but his wife and children had a house to live in and food to eat, so he was already very satisfied. Although his boat had become Jiang Zhen\u2019s, his family\u2019s life was much better now than before.Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng went to the seaside fishing village again to purchase goods. They bought the same goods like last time, but they didn\u2019t buy as much kelp as last time. At the same time, he and Wang Haisheng went to the seaside to pick up 500 kilos of clams.Facts proved that their decision was very correct, because as soon as they arrived in Fucheng, the owner of a restaurant came to them and bought all 500 kilos of clams for two silver per hundred kilos.Live seafood was rarely seen in Fucheng. Last time, Jiang Zhen came here with clams and made people realize that this kind of food was similar to mussels but much smaller. The outer shells were also very beautiful. This way, a restaurant found a business opportunity and took the initiative to buy clams.Clams were the first to be sold out. Jiang Zhen stayed in Fucheng for three or four days selling some of the seafood from the boat, and bought various kinds of goods from Fucheng to load on his boat. In addition, he went to a clothing store to buy cloth, and found a skilled tailor to make clothes according to his and Zhao Jinge\u2019s sizes. As for Zhao Jinge\u2019s size, how did he know it? For several days, he had cuddled a lot with Zhao Jinge, so it would have been strange, if he didn\u2019t know Zhao Jinge\u2019s size!After all that, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng left the city.In Fucheng, some things were more expensive, but other things were much cheaper than in the small towns. For example, things like soy sauce, oil, sugar, and other seasonings were much cheaper than in other county towns because there were special workshops on this side of this city. In the countryside, those goods couldn\u2019t be bought as easily. In these times, not all the people living in the countryside were poor, and in almost every village, there were one or two landlords or wealthy people.Jiang Zhen took Wang Haisheng to the villages along the river, and sold the goods on the boat. The main customers they aimed at were these rich people and landlords in the villages.\u201cThis is the best fabric from Fucheng!\u201d\u201cSmell this wine and vinegar! It\u2019s from the best workshop in Fucheng that is hundreds of years old!\u201d\u201cI still have some seafood here. You can also have a look.\u201d. . .Jiang Zhen turned his boat into a small grocery store, because the variety of goods he carried was much larger than those sold in various villages, and he chose goods of good quality. Later, when he met a county magistrate who had resigned and was returning to his hometown, the ex-official made a bulk purchase of his goods.This county magistrate lived in the countryside and had many servants. He also had silver on his hands, so it was inconvenient for him to go out and buy things. Now that someone brought merchandise to his door, he didn\u2019t care, if they were a bit more expensive.It had been more than ten days since they left on this trip. Jiang Zhen was very tired, but when he thought that he had earned nearly twenty silver, he became refreshed. After calculating the time, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t hesitate to travel again, and Wang Haisheng agreed with him very much.They went back to the fishing village again, but this time, they bought even less salted fish and kelp. They also asked people in the village to pick up clams at a price of one copper penny for two kilos. Finally, they gathered one thousand kilos of clams, which suddenly reduced the number of clams on the beach there.The clams could be stored for a period of time, and their price was not very expensive. So after bringing the clams to Fucheng, Jiang Zhen soon found a buyer for them, after checking restaurant after restaurant. They finally sold for ten silver.They also bought a lot of goods in the town. The ones that were easy to sell prevailed, while the quantity of the less popular merchandise was less. Then, like they did the last time, they swung their boat to the villages to trade.With the experience from the last time, they sold their stock faster and earned even more.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect the bands to sell so well.\u201d Wang Haisheng arranged the headbands and could not help but click his tongue.Jiang Zhen had bought some beautiful headbands and some colorful leftover cloth from the clothing shops and the tailors. The price of these things was very low and few people wanted them in the city, but they sold very well in the countryside. One red headband was one copper penny, and one piece of red cloth that was two fingers wide and two palms long was two copper pennies. It was by no means an impressive amount, but the profit was even higher than the profit of selling kelp.\u201cWomen\u2019s business is the best one,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. Most of the women in this village didn\u2019t have the money to make new clothes and buy new jewelry, but they could afford to spend a penny or two on bright colored small stuff to make flowers out of and wear them on their heads.\u201cJiang Zhen, can you give me these strips of cloth?\u201d Wang Haisheng asked Jiang Zhen for a few long pieces of cloth.\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Zhen agreed without hesitation.Wang Haisheng immediately beamed and said, \u201cJiang Zhen, do you want to leave some for Zhao Jinge? How beautiful these pieces of cloth are?\u201d\u201cNo need.\u201d Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t hesitate to reject Wang Haisheng\u2019s proposal. If he made more money this time, it would be nice to spend some on a silver hairpin for Zhao Jinge, but forget about those bright colored cloth pieces. If Zhao Jinge made them into flowers and wore them on his head . . . He couldn\u2019t imagine it.This trip earned him a little more than he expected. Jiang Zhen was thinking about what to buy for Zhao Jinge as a gift, when his boat was suddenly hit by something.Now that it was already dark, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng docked their boat on the river bank in order to rest. When they were hit like that, the oil lamp on the table turned over.\u201cWho is it?\u201d Jiang Zhen frowned and walked out of the cabin, just to find out that his boat was surrounded by two smaller boats.There were three people standing on each of the two ships, looking like they had no good intentions. When they saw Jiang Zhen, one of them said, \u201cHey, you on the ship, hand over your silver and the goods! Otherwise . . .\u201dThis was . . . They had encountered robbers!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At least, none of the sea merchants in Hecheng County who went to purchase goods with Jiang Zhen chose to do so, because it was actually very dangerous.If a small merchant picked some goods and sold them only in familiar villages, it might not be dangerous. After all, they all knew each other. People who were poor, such as Wang Haisheng, who used to sail with his old boat to unknown places, were generally not in danger. After all, even if you robbed them, you wouldn\u2019t get much money. But a small businessman like Jiang Zhen, who came to a completely new place with a batch of goods . . .Most of the people in the world were honest, but there was never a shortage of robbers and bandits, and the bandits liked to rob small merchants like Jiang Zhen the most.Small businessmen usually didn\u2019t bring too many people, and it was easy to deal with them. Moreover, they didn\u2019t have much power either. Even if they were robbed, they were not able to make trouble for those bandits and robbers. They could only blame their own bad luck if they got killed . . .These days, if someone died in an unknown place, his family could not find him, even if they wanted to. As for reporting to the officials . . . If someone you didn\u2019t know died, who would report it to the officials? Even if it was reported to the officials . . . the government usually threw the body in a mass grave.If there was a bandit group that had gathered dozens or hundreds of people, and these people made a lot of trouble, the government might send someone to eliminate them. But if several people came together to rob a small businessman, the government would neglect this matter and would not even try to catch anyone.The people who stopped Jiang Zhen this time were a small group of water bandits. They were just ordinary people from the neighboring villages who didn\u2019t like to work in the fields, so they started making trouble. First, they stole chicken or beat a dog. Later, after robbing a small businessman, they found out that the money earned from the robbery was a very quick way to earn money, much better than stealing from the villagers, so they simply became water bandits.They had two ships, and they took turns looking for targets in the area. They specially picked this kind of small businessmen who carried goods with them. Although they didn\u2019t get rich from robberies, they could eat meat and fish, drink wine, and live a very happy life most of the time.This time, they targeted Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng. They knew that they were strangers at first sight. They had a lot of goods on board, and they also had some money on their hands. If they robbed them, they could make some profit right away.\u201cIf you obediently hand over all the silver and goods, we will let you live. If not . . . There are already many people who drowned in this river!\u201d The chief of the water bandits was already waiting for Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng to hand over all their belongings. Small businessmen like them were basically afraid to resist them. However, Jiang Zhen was an exception.Jiang Zhen always knew that the ancient times were more dangerous than the modern times, but he didn\u2019t flinch from it, daring to do business only in the city, because he knew one thing, that is, in the south of the Yangtze River, except for those who specialized in selling private salt, there was in fact no other big group of robbers. There were many powerful families and big landlords here, and they would not allow large groups of robbers and bandits to appear on their turf. And those small bandits . . . Jiang Zhen was not afraid of guys who couldn\u2019t even get a steel knife.His ship carried not only his homemade weapons but also small things, such as lime powder. Even if he was in danger, there would be no problem to escape.\u201cJiang-Jiang Zhen! . . . What are we going to do?\u201d Wang Haisheng asked in a trembling voice. He once met water bandits who were so hungry for food that they wanted to rob him. At that time, he had no money, so he simply let them on board to search, and those people did not find anything useful on his boat. But now . . . they not only had goods on board but also silver and copper coins. The copper pennies alone filled two boxes!\u201cWhat else can you do? Take out the silver quickly!\u201d a water bandit roared with laughter.\u201cThey have a nice boat. Let\u2019s take it too,\u201d another one said arrogantly.The moonlight was very bright that night; the water was very beautiful in the moonlight. But these bandits, who were laughing in the moonlight, were frightening. The leader of the bandits looked at Jiang Zhen\u2019s boat and said with a smile, \u201cThis boat is not bad! Come down here. We will search you and let you go. Leave everything else behind!\u201dThese people didn\u2019t take Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng seriously at all. As soon as they opened their mouths, they asked for all Jiang Zhen\u2019s belongings.Jiang Zhen\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly, and at the same time, he started observing the situation around him. Just then, he suddenly heard some sobs. It sounded like, well, like a woman crying? Jiang Zhen glanced at the cabin of the ship that hit him, suddenly startled.Taking a bamboo pole from the boat, Jiang Zhen directly stabbed a man on the boat in the belly. Now that it was so hot, these people didn\u2019t wear much. After Jiang Zhen purposely sharpened the bamboo pole, the abdomen of the man suddenly bled.In Hexi, Jiang Zhen was very careful when he was fighting others. The medical conditions in the area were very poor at this time, so even a small wound could kill a person, if it accidentally got infected. Since he didn\u2019t want to kill people, he was careful. But towards such water bandits, there was no need to show mercy.The water bandit who was stabbed by Jiang Zhen screamed and fell, unable to move. The people around him were shocked. Before they could respond, Jiang Zhen had jumped on their boat with the bamboo pole.Jiang Zhen swept one of them in the water with a bamboo pole and shouted to Wang Haisheng, \u201cWhat are you doing? Can\u2019t fight?\u201dWang Haisheng . . . he really didn\u2019t know how to fight. But it was not like he couldn\u2019t do anything. He also took a bamboo pole and poked with it the people from the other boat when they tried to attack him. At first, he was still a bit scared, but after discovering that the water bandits on the other boat were also afraid of his bamboo pole, he let out a cruel cry, \u201cYou bastards, I will kill you! I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dCompared to Jiang Zhen, Wang Haisheng hated these water bandits even more. He had been living on the water, and he had seen a lot of water bandits robbing and killing people. All these times, he wished that these water bandits would die. Although he had never fought, he had a lot of strength from rowing all year round. At that moment, when his bamboo pole was swinging, they couldn\u2019t get close to him.But the bandits also had bamboo poles on their boats. One of them came forth with a pole used to support the boat. However, this time, Jiang Zhen threw his bamboo pole away, grabbing the pole in the bandit\u2019s arms and pushing it back and forth. Then he pulled the pole out of his hands and hit his neck hard.These days, not even officers and soldiers received special training, let alone these water bandits. Jiang Zhen let them see blood first, and later dealt with several people in succession, which immediately scared the rest of them.\u201cThere are only two of them. What are you afraid of?\u201d the leader of the water bandits yelled at the people around him. He was very tall and fierce, and he was not as afraid of Jiang Zhen as the others. However, even if he was not afraid, the people around him were.\u201cThey are only two people . . .\u201dWhile they were talking, another man was stabbed by Jiang Zhen with his long bamboo pole. They . . . This was a hard hurdle! Of the five water bandits, two were swept in the water by Jiang Zhen and ran away, but the rest were subdued.When he fought the leader of the water bandits, Jiang Zhen also received several hits from him, and even fell in the water with him in the end. However, Jiang Zhen could swim. These days, he had adapted to the water, so he took the man down in the end.They tied the four captured water bandits together. Jiang Zhen started searching them without hesitation, and let Wang Haisheng go to the cabin from where he had heard something before.Wang Haisheng agreed. He carefully lifted the curtain of the cabin and walked in. As a result, he had just entered the cabin, when he ran out in panic. \u201cJiang Zhen, inside . . . there are people in there!\u201d\u201cThere is someone in there. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Jiang Zhen was a bit confused. The people inside should not be water bandits. Why was Wang Haisheng so afraid?Jiang Zhen went over and pulled the curtain, looking around on guard. Then he frowned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The two women\u2019s hands were tied and their mouths were probably stuffed with something. They could only make some intermittent sobs. These two women were definitely not the wives of the water bandits. They were probably kidnapped by those water bandits, and locked inside the cabin, to serve as tools to relieve their desires.Seeing the quilt next to him, Jiang Zhen directly covered them and then cut the ropes on their wrists. He also found two candles to light up, which allowed him to see the appearance of the two women.One of them was a bit older. He estimated her to be in her late twenties. The other one was a bit younger, twenty years old at most. In fact, both of them were very average-looking, but they were not bad for the countryside.The two women grabbed the quilt Jiang Zhen gave them, took out the cloth in their mouths with an \u201cach,\u201d and finally burst into tears.\u201cWhere are you from? Why are you on this ship?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.The two women were still crying, but after a while, the older one finally said, \u201cMy lord, I am from a nearby village. I was kidnaped when I came to visit my relatives . . . \u201d As she spoke, she started crying again.The other woman was still crying. Then the woman continued, \u201cThis girl beside me was originally engaged in a small business with her husband. Later, they were robbed and her husband was thrown in the river . . .\u201d She was taken earlier, and before, they would let her cook and wash clothes. As for why they looked like that today, it was because they tried to run away and got caught.\u201cWhen you die, there is nothing left. The ones hurting the most are your parents and relatives.\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at the woman who had not spoken all this time. There was something wrong with this person\u2019s state of mind. Jiang Zhen was really afraid that she would commit suicide.He couldn\u2019t enlighten people . . . In fact, he felt that it was not the women\u2019s fault that they met this kind of misfortune. But obviously, others would not think so, and even these women themselves would not think so.\u201cI have children at home. I don\u2019t want to die,\u201d the older woman said, and let the other woman talk.\u201cClean up.\u201d Jiang Zhen breathed a sigh of relief and left the cabin.\u201cWhat shall we do now?\u201d Wang Haisheng asked, seeing Jiang Zhen come out, and looked at the cabin with a complex look. As soon as he went in, he was startled, and then he ran out in a hurry. He dared not look at the two women inside at all, but Jiang Zhen stayed inside for a while. This . . . Jiang Zhen has Zhao Jinge. Isn\u2019t that bad?\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about it tomorrow morning,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, then took out a knife and walked to the leader of the bandits. He knew a thing or two about extorting confessions by torture.After learning that these water bandits had killed people, Jiang Zhen showed them no mercy. He naturally extracted information about different parts when he tortured them, which could be regarded as digging up the full background of these water bandits.These water bandits had a nest, but most of the money they snatched from others was carried with them and left on their boat. According to what they confessed, Jiang Zhen finally found more than two hundred silver and some copper pennies, as well as jewelry in the two ships.When Jiang Zhen left the Jiang family house, he had thirty-seven silver on his hands. He spent some, and gave twenty to Wang Haisheng, which left him with a little more than ten silver. It was Zhao Jinge who gave him some money, so he could gather about twenty silver as his initial capital.Later, he made some money and used some of it to give a dowry of ten silver to the Zhao family. Now, if he included the merchandise on the board, the total amount was only about sixty silver. Of course, if he could sell all the goods and sell them for a fair price, there would be about seventy\u2013eighty silver.He had been struggling for so long that he couldn\u2019t even get a good night\u2019s sleep, but he still had so little silver. Now he just spent one night robbing several water bandits, and all of a sudden, he got more than two hundred silver. If he went back and bought land with this money, he could buy paddy fields and another two mu of dryland, then he would never have to worry about going hungry again . . . Of course, he didn\u2019t intend to spend all his money on land.Jiang Zhen moved the heavy silver to his boat and went to see the two women. \u201cWhat are you going to do now?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re leaving,\u201d the older woman said to Jiang Zhen. She was grateful to him for saving her, but she was also a bit afraid of him. She feared that she would be imprisoned again, so she wanted to leave quickly.In fact, Jiang Zhen would like them to leave soon too. He and Wang Haisheng both had families, so it was not good to keep these two women with them.\u201cAlright.\u201d Jiang Zhen nodded and threw a bag of things to them. \u201cThis is for you.\u201dThese water bandits had a lot of jewelry on their hands. He didn\u2019t want these things, and it was troublesome to deal with them, so he simply gave them to the two women . . . After all, it was them who had suffered. The two women\u2019s clothes were still on the ship. When they got dressed, they helped each other and left in the night.Jiang Zhen looked at the sky and said to Wang Haisheng, \u201cLet\u2019s send these people to the yamen.\u201dIt was best to send these people to the yamen. Of course, he would not do it in person. After all, compared to these miserable-looking people, he himself looked more like a robber at the moment.

There were only two streets in the county town, the longer one stretched from east to west, and the shorter one stretched from north to south and was called Hengjie by the local people.This country town was located in the south of the Yangtze River. There weren\u2019t many river tributaries except for one river running through the whole county.The people in the county town washed clothes and vegetables there, so it was always very lively. Some people from the nearby villages would come to the river by boat after harvesting their vegetables, and would then stop by the river to sell them. Over time, the river had become the county town\u2019s vegetable market.Just before dawn, there were many people already coming to the river. Some were noisy and were quarrelling loudly; many small merchants took out fresh vegetables from their boats to sell. At this time, a boat appeared on the shore, but there was no one on board. Instead, a piece of cloth was hung on the bow of the ship with several words written on it. However, most of the people present could not read, so they could not understand the meaning of those words.\u201cWhat is this ship for?\u201d\u201cYeah, what are they doing, stooping like that?\u201dSome people looked at the ship curiously, while others came closer and looked inside.\u201cAh!\u201d a cry of surprise echoed, and a man who approached the boat looked inside with a horrified expression on his face.The man seemed to be frightened, but it was because of this that more people were attracted and went to see the boat. That was when they discovered that inside the cabin with its curtain lifted lay several bloody men who were tied up. This . . . What was going on here?\u201cReport it to the officials!\u201d Soon someone ran to report to the officials.When the people of Ningtang County found the ship and the people lying inside, they immediately reported it to the officials. At the same time, all kinds of guesses about the ship spread rapidly within the county town, but the ones responsible for all this had already left Ningtang.It was already daybreak. Jiang Zhen asked Wang Haisheng to row while he cleaned the bloodstains on the boat and sorted out their cargo. Meanwhile, Wang Haisheng had been secretly watching him while rowing the boat very inattentively.When Wang Haisheng looked over again, Jiang Zhen looked back and frowned. \u201cWhat are you looking at?\u201d\u201cNo-Nothing,\u201d Wang Haisheng said hurriedly.Jiang Zhen looked at Wang Haisheng. Yesterday, whether he had hit or extorted confessions from others, he did not hide it from Wang Haisheng. Later, when he sent those wounded water bandits to Ningtang on their own boat, he asked Wang Haisheng to carry them. He did that to test Wang Haisheng.Wang Haisheng always thought that he was a good man, but he was not like Wang Haisheng imagined.\u201cWhat do you think of what I did before?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cJiang Zhen, I can\u2019t believe you can read!\u201d Wang Haisheng looked at Jiang Zhen with admiration. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you can read. No wonder you can calculate so fast. You\u2019re really talented!\u201dThe worship in Wang Haisheng\u2019s eyes couldn\u2019t be overseen, but Jiang Zhen was speechless. Did Wang Haisheng keep peeping at him just because he thought he could read and write well?\u201cI asked you, what do you think of our fight against the water bandits?\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cThat . . . All water bandits deserve to die!\u201d Wang Haisheng said. \u201cWhy did we have to send them to the officials?\u201dPeople like him, who had no fixed abode, had always stayed away from the government and liked to solve things by themselves, rather than sending them to the officials. At the same time, they had seen too much in life and witnessed too many deaths. In fact, they were much more receptive to killing than modern people. Water bandits would kill them, so killing water bandits in return was nothing to them.Jiang Zhen smiled. \u201cWang Haisheng, you just follow me in the future. As long as you listen to me, I will let you live a good life.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already been following you.\u201d Wang Haisheng looked at Jiang Zhen with bewilderment.\u201cAlso . . . By the way, call me boss later,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Wang Haisheng agreed, and Jiang Zhen gave him about ten silver. \u201cTake it.\u201d\u201cThis . . . This . . . \u201c Wang Haisheng looked at Jiang Zhen with surprise. He always thought that he would be working with Jiang Zhen for food and shelter. He did not expect that Jiang Zhen would give him money.\u201cYou did a good job last night. It\u2019s for you,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, thinking that in the upcoming days, he must train Wang Haisheng well and plant some ideas in his head along the way.This shouldn\u2019t be too difficult. People like Wang Haisheng, who have never been to school or studied, are absolutely easy to fool. Of course, the most urgent thing was to check those bandits\u2019 nest.The water bandits had already disclosed the location of their old nest the day before. But it was too dark last night, so Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t go there and look for it until dawn.This so-called old nest was actually a house in some remote location. The water bandits lived on the boat during the day, but went there to sleep at night. Most of their silver they carried with them, but the stolen goods were piled there. When Jiang Zhen went in the house and looked around, he had a feeling of getting rich. The water bandits were lazy and they were unwilling to sell the goods after stealing them, so there were many goods stacked there. Although a few of them contained food that had gone bad, the rest could still be sold. Moreover, those things were worth more than the cargo on his ship.Without hesitation, Jiang Zhen carried all the goods to the ship. Because there were so many things, their ship could hardly fit them all. These goods included cloth, porcelain, bundles of candles, and even . . . some books.There was not a single book in Hexi Village, so Jiang Zhen had never read a book since he traveled to this era.He sent Wang Haisheng to row, and without anything to do, he opened one of the books and started reading. Then he discovered . . . he couldn\u2019t understand it.Jiang Zhen was actually pretty knowledgeable in the army. He not only had a good knowledge of firearms, but also knew three foreign languages \u2013 English and two languages of Southeast Asia.English was hard for him to learn, so he listened to tapes when he was reading at school, and he was forced to learn the latter two languages because of an assignment. But even if he could speak three foreign languages, he had never learned traditional Chinese characters.And now he had a book in his hands. Not only was it written in traditional chinese characters, but it also lacked punctuation. How could people not know how to write words to form sentences?Can\u2019t you just use colloquialism? At least, he could understand the simplified version of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the signs hanging in front of those shops in the city could also be guessed. Jiang Zhen looked at the book in his hand and stared at it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Unexpectedly, Jiang Zhen was a scholar! He always thought that a scholar was out of reach, and he never expected to have one around him!On the other side, in the town of Tangning, the county lord frowned at the cloth retrieved from the bow of the boat and the words written on it. \u201cWhat is written on this?\u201dMost of the people on the ship were more or less injured. They looked like they had been tortured, but they did not know what had happened to them, who had tied them up, or brought them to the county town . . .\u201cMy lord, I checked . . . It seems to say, \u2018These people are water bandits, who have robbed many people and killed several merchants, so we came to send them to the officials,\u2019 \u201d the teacher of Tangning said. The words were in such a mess. If he had not met yamen officers who could only write a few words, and a bunch of these were misspelled or missing some strokes, he certainly wouldn\u2019t have recognized them now.Come to think of it, the man who caught these water bandits and sent them to the officials was probably a man who had only learned a few words at random.The magistrate of Tangning did not take the initiative to catch those small bandits, but he would be very satisfied and happy if someone could catch them and send them to him.After an interrogation, it turned out that these people were indeed water bandits who had killed several outsiders before. The county magistrate of Tangning directly sentenced them to death. At that time, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng were still selling various kinds of goods.In addition to selling things, Jiang Zhen would also tell Wang Haisheng stories every day. He would spare half an hour each morning and evening to let him exercise, and teach him some combat skills.Wang Haisheng was not young. He was ten years older than Eldest Jiang, and it was impossible for him to learn everything he wanted. Jiang Zhen mainly asked him to learn how to stab with a bamboo pole.Wang Haisheng was a hard-working man. Although he was tired every day, as long as Jiang Zhen asked for it, he would complete his training conscientiously. He was definitely the most obedient soldier Jiang Zhen had ever trained. As a reward, Jiang Zhen bought a kilo of pork every day and cooked it with Wang Haisheng. Now, Wang Haisheng worked even harder.Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng spent more than ten days traveling, and hadn\u2019t sold all the goods on their hands, but Jiang Zhen was already planning to return to Hecheng. He was still determined to go back and marry Zhao Jinge! He didn\u2019t want to face Wang Haisheng all day.Jiang Zhen had now 320 silver and several boxes of copper coins. In fact, it still couldn\u2019t be compared to the Jiang family\u2019s wealth, then after all, the land owned by the Jiang family was very valuable, but even so, this was not a small sum of money.Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng rowed their boat to Fucheng first.After arriving in Fucheng, Jiang Zhen first went to pick up his own custom-made clothes, and then to the blacksmith shop to buy an iron pot, a kitchen knife, and some farming tools, and then continued to buy soy sauce, sugar, and some other seasonings. This time, Jiang Zhen went on a big shopping spree, spending nearly 22 silver, and buying all the things he needed at home.Wang Haisheng looked at the new red clothes on the ship, and felt that Jiang Zhen was like a different person. Before, he bought Zhao Jinge the cheapest cloth, but now he even bought an expensive set of clothes.Jiang Zhen did not know what Wang Haisheng was thinking. He was not a stingy person. He didn\u2019t spend money before because he didn\u2019t have any, but now he had money, so he could spend some. He even bought Zhao Jinge a hairpin.In the city, some well-born gers were raised by their parents as sons, and they could write and read. They were not girly, and they wore male clothes. They usually used hairpins to pull up their hair.Jiang Zhen picked out a hairpin that a ger would use, which was not feminine at all, and it was the most expensive item among all the things he had bought.Wth a ship full of goods, Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng set out on their journey home.At the same time, the villagers in Hexi Village were talking about a great event. The Zhao family\u2019s son was going to get married! Although Jiang Zhen said publicly that he was attracted to Zhao Jinge, the villagers didn\u2019t take him seriously. They only thought that Jiang Zhen wanted to rely on the Zhao family and let them serve him.Later, when they saw that Jiang Zhen was either eating at the Zhaos\u2019 house or asking Zhao Liu to send him food, they were even more certain of this, and even sympathized with the Zhao family.As a result . . . when Jiang Zhen left Hexi and no one knew where he had gone, the Zhao family unexpectedly made preparations for the marriage! At first, some people heard that the Zhao family went to the blind man to ask for a marriage date, and they all thought they wanted to take advantage of Jiang Zhen\u2019s absence to marry Zhao Jinge out and avoid Jiang Zhen. As a result, some people went to Zhao Liu and asked about it, but they were told that Zhao Jinge wanted to marry Jiang Zhen!No. No. They\u2019re not going to marry Zhao Jinge to Jiang Zhen, but . . . they want Jiang Zhen to come to the Zhao family\u2019s house.This . . . Were the Zhao family crazy? They really dared to think about it? Did Jiang Zhen agree?In the countryside, it was normal for poor people to become a son-in-law, but no one in Hexi Village thought that Jiang Zhen would be willing to become a son-in-law.\u201cJiang Zhen is actually quite good. He is sincere to our Jinge. He . . . He has been thinking about our Jinge!\u201d Zhao Liu never tired of talking about it with her friends.These friends looked at Zhao Liu compassionately, but they still didn\u2019t believe her. They only felt that Zhao Liu was deceiving herself and others. There was a ger in their village who was like this. Although his family was very poor, he told others that his family was living a good life and eating meat every day. This was . . .. probably the case with the Zhao family.The Zhao family were making furniture and quilts. Zhao Fugui did not go to work and kept cleaning the house . . . His family didn\u2019t have any money, if he had not been forced by Jiang Zhen, he would not spend money like this! And Zhao Jinge . . . Zhao Jinge looked like that. How could Jiang Zhen be sincere to him and be thinking about him all the time?\u201cJiang Zhen is really good. He gave us money,\u201d Zhao Liu said, and showed people the bracelet on her wrist. \u201cHe also bought me a bracelet.\u201d\u201cYou . . .\u201d someone sighed, thinking that Zhao Liu actually knew how to lie again and again. At first, she said that Jiang Zhen wanted to be their son-in-law. Since he wanted to become their son-in-law, how could Jiang Zhen possibly give her money and buy her a bracelet?Zhao Jinge and his parents were very clear. Could Jiang Zhen be so stupid at this time? Moreover, the marriage was almost settled, but no one knew where Jiang Zhen had gone. He was obviously not interested in this marriage at all. So it was mostly Zhao Liu\u2019s nonsense. As for her bracelet . . .\u201cI didn\u2019t expect you still had a bracelet hidden.\u201d This man only thought that the bracelet was given to Zhao Liu by Zhao Fugui in their early days. Because it was very small, it was not sold when the Zhao family had the accident.Zhao Liu\u2019s face showed a very depressed expression, and she felt even more suffocated.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Zhao Liu was actually very worried about what happened to Jiang Zhen outside.\u201cXiaoshan, when do you think Jiang Zhen will come back?\u201d Zhao Liu asked Sun Xiaoshan, who was helping her feed the ducks in front of her.Sun Xiaoshan had been fishing with Wang Haisheng all these years. Although they had no fishing boat at present, he could still catch some fish by using a fishing net and a bamboo basket. Today, for example, he brought back two special bamboo baskets containing fish. The bamboo baskets had a big opening, which got smaller and smaller. It was filled with earthworms, and the fish that went in to eat the earthworms wouldn\u2019t be able to come out.Hearing Zhao Liu ask this, Sun Xiaoshan paused and whispered, \u201cI don\u2019t know either.\u201d As he spoke, he took out the fishes from the bamboo basket and started chopping them.Sun Xiaoshan would rather eat porridge from wild vegetables than fish. These days, he went to catch fish and snails only to feed the ducks. However, Zhao Liu was often reluctant to feed the fish to the ducks. Every day, she picked a big fish and cooked it.Their family had been eating like this for more than twenty days. Although they were all tired of fish, their health had improved a lot, especially Zhao Jinge\u2019s.He thought that Jiang Zhen always asked him to eat fish in order to improve his health. Now that his family had no shortage of fish, he tried to eat as much as possible and looked much better.\u201cThey shouldn\u2019t be in danger, right? Jiang Zhen is very strong, even if he is in trouble, he should be able to resolve it,\u201d Zhao Liu kept on talking.Sun Xiaoshan was silent and threw the chopped fish to the ducks. Two of the ducks bought by Jiang Zhen died of illness in the past few days, but the rest were growing really well. They were no longer small. They could eat anything and looked very lively.In the countryside, when chicken and ducks were raised for a long time, they were allowed to roam freely. By that time, they could find their way home, but the chicken and ducks that were still too young generally would not be released outside. Even if they were let out, they needed to be watched over, so that they would not get lost.As Zhao Fugui didn\u2019t go to work these days, Zhao Liu asked him to build two enclosures from wooden stakes behind their house. She kept the ducks in the larger enclosure and the five chicken in the smaller one together with the egg-laying hen that Jiang Zhen got from the Jiang family.That hen ate well, and the weather was fine again, so it laid eggs almost every day. Zhao Liu saved those eggs per schedule. Only after laying eggs for more than ten days would they be cooked for the family to eat, and the fresh ones would be stored and kept for Jiang Zhen to eat when he returned.She was very upset after seeing Jiang Zhen climb in through her son\u2019s bedroom window before, but now, she couldn\u2019t help thinking about it. She hoped Jiang Zhen would come back earlier to let the villagers know that she wasn\u2019t lying.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t come back early, but Zhao Jinge did. Now that he was eating well, he possessed inexhaustible strength. He could finish the farm work quickly every day and then go home early.His family did not have much money and could not afford to build another house, but he carefully cleaned up his own courtyard. He also used some mud and painted it all from the outside to make his place look like new. Today, after he came back, Zhao Jinge looked inside and outside and couldn\u2019t find anything to do. Finally, after thinking about it, he simply tossed his earthen stove outside. He cleaned all the ashes in the stove, moved the iron pot out of the stove, and started scraping the bottom of the pot.After cooking in an iron pot for a long time, there would always be a thick layer of ash underneath. In the future cooking would be much slower, so every once in a while, people in Hexi would remove the iron pot from the stove and scrape the ash off the bottom of the pot.Zhao Jinge was scraping the bottom of the pot with a piece of bamboo when, suddenly, an old lady came to the Zhaos\u2019 residence. Zhao Jinge glanced up and then frowned. The old lady who showed up was old lady Jiang, Jiang Zhen\u2019s mother.According to customs, he should go up and entertain her, but Jiang Zhen and old Madam Jiang were at odds after all, and he certainly didn\u2019t want him to curry favor with old Madam Jiang.\u201cWhat a shameless little bitch, ugly and seducing!\u201d old lady Jiang, who saw Zhao Jinge coming over, immediately said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a shameless ger like you before. I said before, why did you have to rescue that debt collector when he fell in the river? It turned out that you had already taken a fancy to him. You really have no shame at all!\u201dOld lady Jiang said a lot of things for some time, which kept Zhao Jinge from responding. At this moment, old lady Jiang continued scolding, \u201cBut you are also so ugly, that no one wanted you except for that jinx! I think you would break your own legs just to make people look at you!\u201dThe Jiang family were having a hard time these days, and old Madam Jiang had it even worse. The reason was . . . that Eldest Jiang ran away. Without the strong and agile laborer, the work in the Jiang family\u2019s farm had been piling up. However, both Jiang Chengwen and Jiang Chengxiang refused to go to the fields.Jiang Chengwen refused to go to the fields because he was too lazy, and Jiang Chengxiang . . . he said he would go to the county town to check if there was anything he could do, so he would leave early and return late every day.At first, even though Jiang Chengwen often refused to work, he would still go to work in the field for half a day. But now, when Jiang Chengxiang didn\u2019t work, he was even more reluctant to work. Finally, all the work in the field had to be done by Butcher Jiang and old lady Jiang! They really weren\u2019t able to do it by themselves and had no choice but to call Jiang Xiaomei to the fields! This way, although it took them a long time, they could still finish their work, but in the end, something happened again at their home.In the past, old lady Jiang always cooked with Jiang Xiaomei. Now both of them had to work in the field. Old lady Jiang asked her two daughters-in-law to cook together, feed the pigs, and also take care of the vegetable garden in front of and behind their house. For the first few days, Huang Min and Zhu Shufen at least prepared the meals, and the pigs were fed, but after a few days . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Originally, there were many people working for the Jiang family, and as soon as she entered through the door, she got pregnant with a child and gave birth to the first grandson of the Jiang family. Old lady Jiang never let her work very much all that time and her nature hadn\u2019t been exposed, but now . . .After only a few days of working, Huang Min was tired. When Zhu Shufen was unwilling to feed the pigs, she did not mind feeding the pigs herself at first, but later, she was not happy about it. Why was Zhu Shufen acting like some lady and walked three feet away from the pigsty when she had to feed these stinking pigs? At the same time, Jiang Yuanwen\u2019s body suddenly started feeling unwell, so Huang Min simply stopped feeding the pigs and said she would take care of her son.Zhu Shufen had to cook for a large family alone, and then still had to wash the dishes and wipe the table, and then water the vegetables in the vegetable field outside. Now that Huang Min refused to feed the pigs, this job also fell on her shoulders.Zhu Shufen, who had cut a handful of vegetables from the garden and was sorting out the leaves, saw that vegetable worms were writhing on the leaves and couldn\u2019t help feeling sick. She didn\u2019t want to work anymore. She simply threw away the leaves and went back to her room to sleep like Huang Min. If she didn\u2019t have to work, so didn\u2019t she either!That day, old lady Jiang and Butcher Jiang came home very tired and found out that not only was the stove cold but no one had fed the pigs either. Butcher Jiang and old lady Jiang immediately got angry. But Huang Min held her son and said that her son was ill. Zhu Shufen was sobbing there in a low voice, and there was nothing they could do about it.These two daughters-in-law had their sons to protect them, and unlike the original Eldest Jiang, they couldn\u2019t be beaten or scolded. The days went by very quickly for the Jiang family.Jiang Chengwen and Jiang Chengxiang used to have a good relationship, but now it was getting worse. Jiang Chengxiang thought that Jiang Chengwen was too lazy and ignorant. Jiang Chengwen thought that Jiang Chengxiang looked down on him as much as he did. In the end, they stopped talking. The Jiang family, which used to be happy, now had people quarreling every day, and the people in the village witnessed many funny scenes.Old lady Jiang, who had always been a strong woman, grew even angrier and resented Jiang Zhen more and more. She didn\u2019t dare to go find trouble with Jiang Zhen, and at first, she didn\u2019t even dare to find the Zhao family to make trouble. But after more than twenty days since Jiang Zhen\u2019s departure had passed, her courage grew. So she went to find the Zhao family.\u201cYou think that this debt collector really thinks highly of you? But he just wants a free laborer. You can just wait and see . . .\u201d Old lady Jiang pointed at Zhao Jinge and scolded him incessantly, singling out Zhao Jinge\u2019s every mistake.Zhao Jinge got angrier and angrier when he heard this. This old Madam Jiang said that Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t like him, which made him even angrier. Throwing the iron pot on the ground, Zhao Jinge stood up and said to old lady Jiang, \u201cDo you think Jiang Zhen won\u2019t come back? Do you want Jiang Zhen to come to your house and make a scene when he comes back?\u201dOld lady Jiang was a woman in the end, and she was not very tall. She did farm work every day these days, so she looked even darker and thinner. Now, how could she dare to talk back to the tall Zhao Jinge?At this time, Wang Yuer, followed by his younger brother Wang Daniu, ran towards their side. \u201cMy father is back! My father is back!\u201d\u201cWhat about Jiang Zhen?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked hurriedly.\u201cUncle Jiang is back too!\u201d Wang Yuer smiled happily and narrowed his eyes.With a smile on his face, Zhao Jinge stood up and ran out. He couldn\u2019t wait to see Jiang Zhen. Old lady Jiang also ran away quickly . . . She couldn\u2019t wait to get away from Jiang Zhen.It was true that Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng had come back, but there were so many things on board the boat that it was difficult for them to directly go home. He and Wang Haisheng stopped the boat by the river near the Zhaos\u2019 house. Wang Yuer, who happened to be playing by the river, went back to ask Zhao Jinge and Zhao Fugui to help carry the things. Then they started packing up the various goods.The people in Hexi could not see the silver Jiang Zhen got, but they could still see the things he had bought and the goods he had not yet sold.Where did Eldest Jiang go? How could he bring back so many things? He . . . became rich?The villagers all looked at Jiang Zhen in shock, but no one dared to ask. At that moment, suddenly someone came running towards them while calling for help.\u201cHelp! Help me!\u201d A ger stumbled in the distance, and behind him were several men.The ger was petite and did not run fast; soon he was caught by a fierce-looking man in his late thirties. The man directly slapped him. \u201cDamn it! Your father has already sold you to me, and you still want to run!\u201dThe ger was hit so badly that he burst into tears. This ger was no stranger to the villagers, and even Jiang Zhen knew him. It was He Qiusheng, the most beautiful ger in the village, who had once asked Jiang Zhen for the snake.Jiang Zhen had just come back and didn\u2019t know what happened, but everyone in the village already knew about it. It all started when He Qiusheng\u2019s gambler of a father got indebted to Liu Heitou from Qiaotou Village for a large sum a few days ago. Although He Qiusheng\u2019s father loved to gamble, he had no money on his hands and his family\u2019s land had already been sold by him. Under such circumstances, let alone his relatives and friends, even loan sharks were unwilling to lend him money. Therefore, even if he wanted to gamble big, he had no chance to do so. In short, he stole some money from home and continued to lose. As a result, this man borrowed 30 silver from Liu Heitou some time ago and lost it all.How could their family pay back 30 silver? Not to mention that Liu Heitou had said that he was not interested in money, but was thinking about a ger. So in the past few months, the amount Father He owed Liu Heitou had already increased to sixty silver. If he didn\u2019t pay it back, it would become 120 silver next month.At first, when he got indebted, he kept it hidden from his family, but later, he couldn\u2019t keep it a secret any longer. Liu Heitou came to their house with several of his brothers!As soon as these people came to the door, they beat up Father He and He Qiusheng\u2019s two brothers and then asked the He family to pay back the money. The He family had to pay it back within five days, otherwise, they were going to take He Qiusheng and let him become Liu Heitou\u2019s concubine. That day was also the day when they came to take away He Qiusheng.There were many men in the village who liked He Qiusheng, but no one dared to offend Liu Heitou. They could only watch him be taken away by Liu Heitou. However, no matter how bad Father He was, he was still He Qiusheng\u2019s father. If he wanted to sell He Qiusheng, the villagers couldn\u2019t stop him.\u201cYou\u2019d better be nice to me, or you\u2019ll see!\u201d Liu Heitou slapped He Qiusheng again.Just as Jiang Zhen was now the bully in Hexi Village, Liu Heitou was the bully in Qiaotou Village.Liu Heitou\u2019s father and three brothers were all bold and ruthless. At present, no one in Qiaotou dared to provoke them. Later, his three brothers got married and had children respectively. In Liu Heitou\u2019s generation, the Liu family had ten cousins. Liu Heitou was the eldest of the ten.Life wasn\u2019t easy if there were too many people in the family. Liu Heitou had several younger brothers and sisters, so he often couldn\u2019t eat enough, and his thinking grew twisted. At first, he took advantage of other people in the village, and then he began collecting debts with his younger brothers in order to make money. In just a short time, he started gaining a \u201cgreat reputation.\u201d There was a reason why he lent money to Father He this time\u2014he accidentally saw what He Qiusheng looked like.Liu Heitou already had a wife and children and his eldest child was even twelve years old. But He Qiusheng looked so fine that it made his heart itch. And so he lent some money to his father . . . If Father He could not pay, He Qiusheng would be his.\u201cTie him up and bring him back with us,\u201d Liu Heitou pushed He Qiusheng to the ground and instructed his two younger brothers. He liked He Qiusheng\u2019s face, but he did not belong to the men who usually admired him. He had no pity for He Qiusheng. He just wanted to have him in his bed as soon as possible.He Qiusheng cried even more; he had also thought about his own future. He wanted to find a rich man for his family, and marry him and live a good life in the future. But in the end . . . marry Liu Heitou or die young. He knew that if he were to marry him, he would not have a good life and might even be tortured to death . . . This Liu Heitou once married a woman in order to give birth to a child for him, but she died within two years . . . They said that Liu Heitou not only liked to hit people but also liked to give his woman to his brothers to play with . . . At this moment, He Qiusheng\u2019d rather die immediately.Jiang Zhen had also recalled some things about Liu Heitou from Eldest Jiang\u2019s memories. When he saw this scene, he couldn\u2019t help but frown. He wasn\u2019t one to meddle, and he didn\u2019t even have a good impression of He Qiusheng. However, He Qiusheng was only fifteen years old this year, and in modern times, he would still be a minor in junior high.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The bridegroom, on his wedding day, had still gone outside to play with his friends and forgot the time, until he was finally called back by his mother.If this was a normal marriage, Jiang Zhen would not spare it a second thought, however . . . this was obviously a bully who kidnapped other people\u2019s children. Jiang Zhen had not thought it over when the petite He Qiusheng suddenly moved.Although He Qiusheng was unlucky to have a gambling father, his mother and his two brothers were both good and loved him very much. He grew up well and was spoiled by the people in the village all the time. He had never been wronged since he grew up.The sudden encounter of such a thing was really unbearable for the young ger, who usually only thought about how to get a drink or some delicious food from his admirers. If it was not for how notorious Liu Heitou was, or if Liu Heitou had been a little kinder, He Qiusheng might have accepted his fate, however . . . the first time Liu Heitou came to their door, He Qiusheng\u2019s two brothers were beaten up severely. Just now, at his home, when he tried to touch him, He Qiusheng struggled a bit and was beaten by him too. It was the first time that He Qiusheng had been hit in his live, and he was really scared. Later, his two brothers got angry and rushed to fight with Liu Heitou. He used this chance to escape from the house, but what happened after he escaped? He was caught again.He Qiusheng stared at Liu Heitou in a daze, accepting his fate, but when Liu Heitou\u2019s two brothers came to tie him up, he suddenly jumped up and rushed to the river.Although the water here was not deep enough to drown, he really wanted to die at this moment. It was better to die quickly than to be tortured!\u201cBitch!\u201d Liu Heitou thought he had frightened and subdued He Qiusheng. While scolding him, he let his brother go in the water to catch him.When he went out to collect other people\u2019s debts, he saw a lot of things and a lot of people seeking death. He Qiusheng tricked him, when he wasn\u2019t paying attention. He was such a small thing that should immediately be obedient after a beating and several threats against his family. However, before Liu Heitou could take action, Jiang Zhen came up with a bamboo pole.He did not know exactly what happened, but after listening to Liu Heitou\u2019s words, he could roughly guess it from the expressions on the faces of the villagers around him. They were scared and angry but didn\u2019t dare to do anything. No matter what, today, he couldn\u2019t let Liu Heitou take He Qiusheng away under his nose.This Liu Heitou was not a good man. Jiang Zhen had no intention of showing any mercy, because these things happened in the countryside sometimes. It\u2019s just that Liu Heitou\u2019s skills were . . .Jiang Zhen had fought with many people since he came to this place, and of all these people, Liu Heitou\u2019s skills were the best. As a yamen officer, Yang Jing relied on his uniform to scare people away. His kung fu was just for show. The previous group of water bandits were just a group of lazy and bullying little masters, but this Liu Heitou was different. Liu Heitou had gained his reputation with punches and kicks!Against Jiang Zhen, Liu Heitou suffered a minor loss at first, but he was able to fight back very quickly. All his moves were aimed at Jiang Zhen\u2019s key points; he obviously had a very rich experience in fighting. Jiang Zhen immediately got interested. It was boring being able to take people down easily every time. This Liu Heitou was really a strong fighter.When Jiang Zhen was on a mission before, he met a man who was born with an iron fist; his fighting style was just like Liu Heitou\u2019s. Without any routine, he was \u201cpragmatic and effective.\u201d At that time, Jiang Zhen, who was just a young man, suffered a loss, but now . . . Jiang Zhen had a lot of experience and this Liu Heitou couldn\u2019t compare to that man. In fact, in terms of raw physical strength, Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t compare to Liu Heitou. Eldest Jiang hadn\u2019t eaten anything healthy for so many years, while Liu Heitou had a strong body developed by eating fish and meat all these years. The physical condition of the two couldn\u2019t be compared at all. Fortunately, Jiang Zhen had experience and skills.For a while, Jiang Zhen was relying on his flexibility and thorough understanding of all parts of the human body, gaining the upper hand in the fight.\u201cFuck!\u201d\u201cYou want to die!\u201d\u201cKill him!\u201dAfter Liu Heitou\u2019s brothers noticed that their eldest brother was at a disadvantage, they no longer cared about He Qiusheng and just wanted to besiege Jiang Zhen.\u201cAh!\u201d However, at that time, Wang Haisheng shouted, holding a long bamboo pole in his thick arms and rushed towards Liu Heitou\u2019s brothers.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t let Wang Haisheng practice anything else these days. He only practiced stabbing moves with the bamboo pole, and he also helped him find a very suitable bamboo pole, which Wang Haisheng was holding right now.This bamboo pole was not cut too sharp, but it still had a sharp end that could pierce people. Liu Heitou\u2019s brother, whose stomach got pierced, immediately screamed. Wang Haisheng let go of him and immediately rushed to the other man.At the same time, Jiang Zhen knocked Liu Heitou\u2019s forehead with the bamboo pole and let him drop to the ground.\u201cQiusheng, Qiusheng . . .\u201d Just then, two young men with swollen black-and-blue faces arrived, limping as they walked. They shouted He Qiusheng\u2019s name while wiping their tears. It was He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng, He Qiusheng\u2019s two brothers.In fact, unlike He Chunsheng who was born in spring, He Xiasheng and He Qiusheng were not born in summer and winter like their names suggested. They were named this way because it was pleasant to hear and easy to remember.He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng really loved He Qiusheng. Even though they couldn\u2019t get married because their family had no money, they never thought of exchanging him for a large amount of bride price for the sake of getting their own wives.By this time, He Qiusheng might have already been captured by Liu Heitou, so they naturally were very worried. They hoped that the villagers would save He Qiusheng, but they also knew that such a possibility was unlikely. At the moment, they were both very desperate. They thought that He Qiusheng had already been caught, but they didn\u2019t want to run away. In the end, the situation they faced was completely different from what they imagined. Eldest Jiang had unexpectedly knocked down Liu Heitou with a bamboo pole!Jiang Zhen stepped on Liu Heitou\u2019s chest, changed his grip on the pole and looked at Liu Heitou\u2019s brothers next to him with a sneer. \u201cDon\u2019t you know that you shouldn\u2019t cross the boundary? This Hexi Village is my territory! If you try to kidnap people on my territory, you don\u2019t take me seriously!\u201dHe Chunsheng had also seen Jiang Zhen beat up people before. Back then, he thought Jiang Zhen was terrible, but this time, he thought that Jiang Zhen could not be more majestic. However, he soon returned to his senses and saw his little brother. He Qiusheng was standing in the river, wet and stunned.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It could be said that the river in Hexi was about two meters deep in the middle, but the areas on both sides of the river were very shallow and the possibility of drowning was very limited.Now He Qiusheng was standing more than one meter in the river, and the water only reached to his waist. He Qiusheng was a bit shocked at this moment. He had just made up his mind to die, but in the blink of an eye, Liu Heitou, who he thought was very powerful, was knocked to the ground . . .\u201cElder Brother, what are you doing?\u201d Liu Heitou hated Jiang Zhen very much at this moment, but he had already lost, so he could only grind his teeth and ask.\u201cJiang Zhen from Hexi Village!\u201d Jiang Zhen said while stepping on Liu Heitou\u2019s chest a few more times with his feet. \u201cIf you had used your crooked brain, you wouldn\u2019t have come to provoke me. I don\u2019t care about you. If you had used your crooked brain . . . you would have known not to provoke me.\u201dHearing Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, Liu Heitou froze. The ordinary villagers around could not see it, but when he was fighting Jiang Zhen just now, he could feel that this man had a more ruthless character than he had. If not, how could this man be so familiar with his ways? Moreover, this Jiang Zhen had definitely killed people and seen blood . . . Liu Heitou hated Jiang Zhen very much, but he wasn\u2019t completely sure about the situation, and he really didn\u2019t dare to offend such a person.Despite the fact that he didn\u2019t take other people\u2019s lives seriously, not even that of the concubines he had taken, he still cared about his wife, children, parents and brothers. Therefore he was afraid of offending ruthless people from outside his village that could bring harm to his family.\u201cJiang Zhen, right? I\u2019ll remember it this time!\u201d Liu Heitou said with a black face. \u201cYou let me go! I won\u2019t try to catch this ger anymore!\u201d He firmly believed that Jiang Zhen wouldn\u2019t dare to kill him in public, and Jiang Zhen really didn\u2019t.Jiang Zhen let Liu Heitou go, and when Liu Heitou\u2019s brothers saw this, they immediately helped him stand up.\u201cIf you want this ger, I\u2019ll give him to you. I have others, no worse than this one, but I will still ask you to repay the debt when I come back!\u201d Liu Heitou dropped these words, turned around, and left.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t stop him. Father He really owed Liu Heitou a debt. Naturally, he had to pay his debt, and he did not care about that. Of course, the most important thing was . . . that he was about to get married, and for the time being, he didn\u2019t want to offend the large number of people from the Liu family and get in trouble. But later . . . he\u2019d better get rid of this Liu Heitou, or he would be uneasy.Jiang Zhen put away his bamboo pole and was about to go back to picking up his goods when he saw Zhao Jinge approaching and a smile appeared on his face. He hadn\u2019t seen Zhao Jinge for more than half a month. He really missed him.Jiang Zhen was happy, but Zhao Jinge was full of anxiety at this moment. He came relatively late. When he just arrived, Jiang Zhen had already released Liu Heitou, and he heard Liu Heitou\u2019s parting words. Looking at Liu Heitou and the others\u2019 appearance, and then at the poor He Qiusheng, who was still standing in the river, Zhao Jinge pulled at his clothes and felt uneasy.As soon as he heard the news of Jiang Zhen coming back, he ran over and forgot to take care of his own appearance. Now, he was not only wearing the rags he usually wore to work, but he also smelled of sweat. Compared to He Qiusheng, he was really nothing to look at, ugly and smelly. No, not only that, there were also ash stains on his hands . . .Zhao Jinge felt extremely embarrassed and scared. He knew about this family\u2019s problem. Now that Jiang Zhen saved He Qiusheng from Liu Heitou, was He Qiusheng to become Jiang Zhen\u2019s? Zhao Jinge couldn\u2019t help thinking like this, and so did the other people in Hexi . . .Last time Jiang Zhen came back from outside, someone was bullying Zhao Jinge, so he went to save Zhao Jinge, and said that Zhao Jinge was his man. This time . . . How similar was this to last time? Only this time, he didn\u2019t save such an ugly ger like Zhao Jinge but a beautiful ger like He Qiusheng.Jiang Zhen had subdued Liu Heitou and saved He Qiusheng. The He family didn\u2019t want to marry He Qiusheng to Liu Heitou, so they could only give him to Jiang Zhen. After all, other people would not dare to marry him in order not to offend Liu Heitou. And thinking about it . . . although Jiang Zhen had a bad reputation, he was still a bit better than Liu Heitou. Moreover, he was not married yet and He Qiusheng was not so young anyway . . . Of course, there was no room for any other candidates. If Jiang Zhen had fallen in love with He Qiusheng, how could his family resist?\u201cJiang Zhen brought back a lot of things this time, and all of them seem to be very valuable. It is not a loss for He Qiusheng to marry him . . .\u201d\u201cDid Jiang Zhen take a fancy to He Qiusheng this time?\u201d\u201cFor me, I would also pick He Qiusheng and not Zhao Jinge.\u201d\u201cThe Zhao family was thinking about marriage before, but Jiang Zhen probably doesn\u2019t like their family now.\u201d. . .There were many people whispering around Zhao Jinge. Zhao Jinge couldn\u2019t help but lower his head. In fact, not only the villagers thought this way, the three brothers of the He family thought the same. Jiang Zhen\u2019s willingness to fight against Liu Heitou was probably because he took a fancy to He Qiusheng!He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng clenched their fists and felt somewhat sad, while at the same time, He Qiusheng had already climbed up from the river. Before, He Qiusheng was also a bit afraid of Jiang Zhen, but this fear couldn\u2019t be compared to his fear of Liu Heitou. After all, Liu Heitou beat him, and Jiang Zhen . . . He had only seen Jiang Zhen beating others. Besides . . . just now, no one was willing to save him, and the men who said they liked him, all stayed away. But Jiang Zhen saved him, which made him develop some different feelings for Jiang Zhen. If Jiang Zhen liked him . . . In fact, Jiang Zhen was much better than Liu Heitou . . .\u201cHello, Eldest Jiang . . .\u201d He Qiusheng said.\u201cJinge!\u201d But Jiang Zhen had already arrived by Zhao Jinge\u2019s side.It had been such a long time since he had last met him. He really wanted to kiss him, but now there were so many people . . . Jiang Zhen sighed. In the end, he just held Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand, then caressed it several times before asking, \u201cDid you miss me?\u201dZhao Jinge raised his head abruptly and saw Jiang Zhen looking at him with a smile, ignoring He Qiusheng, who had climbed ashore and was still calling for him. He might not have said anything before, but now . . . Zhao Jinge whispered, \u201cYes.\u201d With that, he also held Jiang Zhen\u2019s hand.Feeling the strength in his hand, Jiang Zhen wanted to take Zhao Jinge\u2019s palm and kiss it. He tried to restrain himself and said, \u201cJinge, I bought some things from Fucheng. Let\u2019s pack them up and take them home . . . I also brought you a present.\u201dAs he was talking, he pulled Zhao Jinge to the river; his cold and hard expression had softened.At that moment, the people around were stunned. This situation was different from what they thought! Jiang Zhen, he unexpectedly ignored He Qiusheng and took Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand? What Zhao Liu boasted about was not a lie? It was true?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But no one believed her.It was really . . . Zhao Jinge looked like a man. Saying that Jiang Zhen wanted him because he could work, they would believe that. But Jiang Zhen attached great importance to him . . . How could it be possible!They always thought Zhao Liu was talking nonsense. When they saw that Jiang Zhen helped He Qiusheng and defeated Liu Heitou, they were even more convinced of that\u2014almost everyone thought that Jiang Zhen was after He Qiusheng. For a while, their sympathy for the Zhao family reached its peak and since then, everybody sympathized with the Zhao family. In fact, some of them were happy for the Zhao family. They thought that, with this, the Zhao family could finally get rid of Jiang Zhen. However, the final result came as a surprise to everyone.After Jiang Zhen saved He Qiusheng, he didn\u2019t even look at him. His eyes were glued to Zhao Jinge, who looked a little gray . . . Is his eyesight really alright? Moreover, Jiang Zhen who usually looked so fierce, while looking at Zhao Jinge looked very gentle . . .Jiang Zhen brought back a lot of things. There was a lot of porcelain among the goods he snatched from the water bandits. The ceramic crockery was very exquisite, which made it unaffordable for ordinary villagers, so he didn\u2019t sell it. He kept it all, in addition to the various kinds of food he bought from Fucheng . . . He knew at a glance that he could sell the goods he had brought on his ship for several hundred silver.Zhao Jinge was surprised when he saw these things. Jiang Zhen paid him the bride price, so he knew that Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t have much money. Now that Jiang Zhen bought so many things at once, he didn\u2019t spend all his money, did he? However, he brought the goods with them and came back. If he sold them later, he wouldn\u2019t lose money.\u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of money this time, so I have bought a few different kinds of food to eat,\u201d Jiang Zhen explained.\u201cUm,\u201d Zhao Jinge answered, and the corners of his mouth could not help but hook up. His original uneasiness dissipated after Jiang Zhen held his hand. Now that he was facing the unbelieving eyes of the people around them, his heart was both happy and satisfied. He didn\u2019t think his mood was right, but he couldn\u2019t help it at all.\u201cEldest Jiang!\u201d He Qiusheng, who had already climbed ashore, called again and came near Jiang Zhen.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d He Qiusheng calmed his panicked mood and looked at Jiang Zhen. After a pause, he said, \u201cThank you for saving me.\u201dSpeaking of it, He Qiusheng\u2019s appearance was really good. He was slapped twice before, and his face was a bit swollen, but it still didn\u2019t affect his appearance, and even made him look more pitiful. The wet clothes outlined his slim figure and complimented his white neck, which made people want to knock him down.Of course, this applied to the other men in Hexi. For Jiang Zhen . . . this was a minor who had just been subjected to a violent attack, which was pitiful but nothing more.\u201cI didn\u2019t save you. That man may still come. You\u2019d better find a way to sort things out,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.He Qiusheng\u2019s father was a bastard. If he had the ability to resist, he would never indulge such a father, but it was the He family\u2019s decision . . . All the money He Qiusheng\u2019s mother and his two elder brothers earned over the years had been squandered by this father.After that reminder, Jiang Zhen no longer cared about He Qiusheng. He gazed at Zhao Jinge. \u201cShall we go back?\u201dJiang Zhen asked Wang Haisheng to keep an eye on the ship and the cargo, then picked up two loads and gave the lighter one to Zhao Jinge, and carried the heavier one on his own back. Then he walked home with Zhao Jinge.\u201cJinge, did you get off work early today?\u201d\u201cJinge, how are the preparations for our wedding going?\u201d\u201cJinge, did you order a new bed?\u201d. . .Jiang Zhen asked questions as they walked, and Zhao Jinge answered them earnestly one by one. In fact, Jiang Zhen kept asking questions mainly because he wanted to talk with Zhao Jinge, but Zhao Jinge replied too seriously, so he also got serious and asked attentively about the wedding.When they were halfway home, Zhao Liu also came. When she saw them, Zhao Liu smiled till her eyes narrowed. \u201cJiang Zhen, you are back! I am so glad you are back!\u201d\u201cMother,\u201d Jiang Zhen called.Zhao Liu immediately felt that she was about to float. On the other hand, by the river, Wang Haisheng was surrounded by the people of Hexi at this time.\u201cFisherman, are you and Eldest Jiang doing business together?\u201d someone curiously asked.\u201cNo, I\u2019m working for the boss. I fight.\u201d Wang Haisheng smiled.\u201cWhat kind of business is Eldest Jiang doing? Did he make a lot of money?\u201d someone asked again.\u201cHe made some profit,\u201d Wang Haisheng said with a smile. These people wanted to ask more, but they couldn\u2019t find the words.Jiang Zhen had explained to him that there were some things that could not be said. Some people surrounded Wang Haisheng, while others went to check on He Qiusheng. Most of the people who went to He Qiusheng were his admirers. They didn\u2019t dare to step up before, fearing that Liu Heitou would target them, and it would affect their families. But now, they dared to come and show their concern. However, He Qiusheng didn\u2019t want to deal with them at all. He walked towards He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng and said, \u201cBrothers . . .\u201dLooking at He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng\u2019s appearance, He Qiusheng started crying again. What should they do now? As long as their father was alive, they would not be able to live a peaceful life . . .\u201cQiusheng, let\u2019s go back first,\u201d He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng said to their younger brother. Although Jiang Zhen had chased Liu Heitou away, He Qiusheng was not safe yet. In other words, why did Jiang Zhen just leave? They were worried that Jiang Zhen wanted to steal He Qiusheng away like Liu Heitou, and they even planned to negotiate with Jiang Zhen. But in the end, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t even look at their brother! He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng\u2019s feelings were very complicated.Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge went back and forth several times to pick up everything from the boat to the Zhaos\u2019 residence. While they were busy going back and forth, there were always villagers around them looking at them strangely. The villagers couldn\u2019t help but look at this situation weirdly.They had always sympathized with the Zhao family and Zhao Jinge, who had been targeted by Jiang Zhen, and they thought that the life of the Zhao family would not be easy in the future, but now it seemed . . . How could life become more difficult for the Zhao family? Their life was going to be better from now on.Jiang Zhen actually sent so many things directly to the Zhaos\u2019 house! What\u2019s more, they didn\u2019t know what kind of eyes Jiang Zhen had, but so far . . . it seemed that he really had a crush on Zhao Jinge . . . He didn\u2019t even look at He Qiusheng, but liked Zhao Jinge!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Right then, someone thought of something, \u201cSpeaking of which, a few days before the third Jiang son\u2019s marriage, Eldest Jiang fell in the water. At that time, it was Zhao Jinge who went down the river to save him. It was really kind of him.\u201d\u201cIs that why Jiang Zhen is with him? In other words, Jiang Zhen is grateful . . .\u201d That was how human nature was. They didn\u2019t recall this before. After all, Eldest Jiang didn\u2019t die at that time, so they didn\u2019t think about the life saved . . .\u201cKnowing how to repay gratitude? Jiang Zhen is in great trouble! He offended that Liu Heitou, and in the future, no one knows if the people of Hexi would not be targeted by that Liu Heitou!\u201d The second Jiang uncle knocked on the ground with his crutches. He looked very sad and worried.When some timid people heard what the second Jiang uncle said, they were worried too and resented Jiang Zhen. However, some young people could not help murmuring, \u201cI think Jiang Zhen is very good . . .\u201d What Jiang Zhen did this day made them feel really happy!Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know that some people in the village had changed their attitude towards him. He was now talking with the Zhaos about everything he brought from Fucheng.When they heard these things were for the family, both Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui were shocked. They didn\u2019t expect that Jiang Zhen would give them something after the ten silver last time, but he brought so many things back this time.\u201cJiang Zhen, our family doesn\u2019t even have any land now, so it\u2019s better to save money. There\u2019s no need to rush to buy these things . . . \u201d Zhao Fugui said because he was a bit worried that Jiang Zhen had spent all of the forty silver that the Jiang family had given him. In that case, how would his family live in the future? It was just that Jiang Zhen was not his child. He couldn\u2019t say too much.\u201cDad, I didn\u2019t spend money. I gained unexpected wealth this time, so I bought some things,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Zhao Fugui didn\u2019t ask what the unexpected wealth was, but nodded. \u201cSo it turns out it was like this. It\u2019s good that you know . . . By the way, the ten silver you gave me, and the money I have saved over the years, I put it all together, so we can buy an acre of paddy field. I have already asked someone to help me look for it. Would you like to go and have a look?\u201dZhao Fugui was planning to buy it under Jiang Zhen\u2019s name, and his money was regarded as a betrothal gift . . . Their Zhao family couldn\u2019t take advantage of Jiang Zhen.\u201cIt\u2019s good to buy land, Dad. Let\u2019s buy more.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled and put hundred silver on the table. \u201cFirst, buy 5 mu of paddy field, and if there is more, buy some dryland.\u201d With Zhao Fugui and his wife, together with him and Zhao Jinge, the output from 5 mu of paddy field would be almost enough to feed them.As a matter of fact, Jiang Zhen still had two hundred silver on him, so it was okay to buy more land. But at this stage, he still hoped to keep more cash on his hands.Jiang Zhen said it lightly, but the Zhao family was shocked, and Zhao Liu jumped up in surprise. \u201cJiang Zhen, where did you get so much silver?\u201d Could it be that the money wrapped in cloth was one hundred silver? Where did Jiang Zhen get it?\u201cThat\u2019s what I call unexpected wealth. When I was doing business outside, I saved a man from some water bandits. He gave me two hundred silver to thank me,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cThis . . . This . . .\u201d Two hundred? Even when the Zhao family was in good condition, all their possessions did not add up to two hundred silver!The Zhao family couldn\u2019t respond anymore. When they were eating, everyone felt a bit dizzy, and Zhao Liu almost fed rice to her nose. Zhao Fugui also forgot to ask about He Qiusheng and Liu Heitou. However, even this being the case, they still sent Jiang Zhen out of the door and didn\u2019t let him stay the night.Jiang Zhen: \u201c. . .\u201d He wanted to talk to Zhao Jinge too. Fortunately, in another six days, he and Zhao Jinge would get married.Zhao Jinge also wanted to talk to Jiang Zhen. Before, when Jiang Zhen ignored He Qiusheng, he thought that Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t have money to help He Qiusheng pay his debts, that\u2019s why Jiang Zhen ignored him. It turned out . . . Jiang Zhen was actually rich! He had misunderstood Jiang Zhen again . . . Zhao Jinge\u2019s heart had a sense of restlessness and sweetness.That night, Zhao Liu went to sleep on the bamboo couch in Zhao Jinge\u2019s house once again. Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu had made a new bed for Zhao Jinge and Jiang Zhen, but they couldn\u2019t sleep together until they got married. Zhao Jinge was still lying on the simple wooden bed and listened to what Zhao Liu told him to do after they got married.Zhao Liu usually talked about what should be said, but this time, she didn\u2019t say much. After a while, she seemed to have fallen asleep.Zhao Jinge was lying in his bed quietly for a long time. After confirming that his mother should have already fallen asleep, he finally got up from his bed and went out quietly. He really wanted to see Jiang Zhen, even if he was already asleep.Zhao Jinge\u2019s steps were very light, but Zhao Liu wasn\u2019t asleep at all. When she heard the noise, she opened her eyes in the dark. Looking at her son\u2019s back, she hated that iron couldn\u2019t turn into steel. But after thinking about it for a moment, she just picked up her quilt and went to Zhao Fugui.Today, Jiang Zhen shocked their family even more than he did before. It was not only Zhao Jinge and Zhao Liu who couldn\u2019t fall asleep, but Zhao Fugui too. He kept thinking about how well their family would live in the future, and then he heard the sound of a door opening. His son must have run out. Zhao Fugui couldn\u2019t feel depressed anymore. After all, this time, it was his son who ran out on his own initiative, and he couldn\u2019t blame Jiang Zhen for this.In fact, Jiang Zhen was sleeping very well that night, but he was still very alert. So when Zhao Jinge knocked on his window, he immediately got up from the bed and opened it.\u201cJinge, I have so much to tell you,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cMe too . . . \u201d Zhao Jinge said.Jiang Zhen had already taken out all the things he planned to give the Zhao family, but the hairpin that he intended to give Zhao Jinge was still on his hands. As soon as he lit a big candle, Jiang Zhen immediately took out the hairpin. \u201cI bought you a hairpin.\u201dZhao Jinge was surprised to see this. In the past, Jiang Zhen sent a lot of food and some practical things, but he never gave him jewelry. This hairpin was so beautiful that he didn\u2019t even dare to reach for it . . .When Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t move, Jiang Zhen directly grabbed a lock of his hair and put the hairpin on. Jiang Zhen\u2019s hair was tied with cloth, which was relatively easy to tie, but this hairpin . . . Jiang Zhen tried several times and fixed the hairpin on top of Zhao Jinge\u2019s head with difficulty.Zhao Jinge\u2019s hair was pulled a little, which was a bit painful, but Zhao Jinge was still very happy and couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cYou . . . why are you so nice to me?\u201d\u201cBecause I like you,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Zhao Jinge paused and finally said with certainty, \u201cI like you too.\u201dJiang Zhen suddenly didn\u2019t want to let Zhao Jinge go back. It was just . . . it was better to wait until their wedding night . . . Jiang Zhen took a deep breath and endured again. However, this bargain still had to be taken advantage of.\u201cJinge, shall we go to bed and have a rest?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although at the beginning it was always kissing and touching only, there were so many places that could catch fire . . . However, after Jiang Zhen said, \u201cI\u2019ll rub it,\u201d he really just dawdled and didn\u2019t go in. Although they didn\u2019t do it to the end, they relieved each other with their hands. Jiang Zhen even used Zhao Jinge\u2019s legs.It was nothing for Jiang Zhen, but for Zhao Jinge, the impact was obviously considerably stronger. When they finished, he lay frozen and motionless on Jiang Zhen\u2019s bed. It never occurred to him that he would do such a thing, this . . .When he was a child, Zhao Jinge was told by Zhao Liu that as a ger, he could not let others see his body, let alone let anyone touch that place. Only after marriage could he let his husband touch it. As a result, before he got married, he and Jiang Zhen . . . Jiang Zhen\u2019s scent was all over his body, and Zhao Jinge was in a trance.Jiang Zhen was in a very good mood. Although he failed to do it to the end, it was the happiest time of his life. Only then did he realize that it was unbearable to use his hand and five fingers to relieve himself. The only regret was that, because of the lack of lubrication, it was a little painful after rubbing it for a long time. But it was not a bad thing, was it? If it didn\u2019t continue that long, he wouldn\u2019t even be hurt. Obviously, after he got better, his endurance would also increase.While humming, Jiang Zhen lit a fire to heat the water, and when the water was almost boiling, he asked Zhao Jinge to come over and take a bath. Jiang Zhen wanted to take a bath with Zhao Jinge very much; however, Zhao Jinge refused. He sighed and could only wash separately.The two of them had gone a little too far, and both of their clothes were stained. After taking a bath, Jiang Zhen took the clothes and the bedsheets to wash them, but Zhao Jinge stopped him. \u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201dIn Zhao Jinge\u2019s opinion, washing clothes should be done by him.\u201cGood.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled and didn\u2019t refuse. He lit a candle for Zhao Jinge, then moved a stool to sit behind him and helped him comb his hair.We couldn\u2019t buy ready-made clothes in the county town, but there are some in Fucheng. Before, when Jiang Zhen went to Fucheng, he asked a tailor to make clothes for their marriage and even bought two sets of ready-made clothes. This time, he and Zhao Jinge had changed into one of the sets.The fabric of this ready-made garment was very common, but it was much better than the coarse cloth he used to wear. After Zhao Jinge put it on, he looked more energetic.Jiang Zhen wiped dry Zhao Jinge\u2019s hair while talking with him. In the end, they washed their clothes together sweetly.\u201cJinge, this is your pocket money.\u201d Jiang Zhen gave Zhao Jinge twenty silver.\u201cI don\u2019t need it,\u201d Zhao Jinge hurriedly said. Before, that hundred silver was intended to buy land under Jiang Zhen\u2019s name, so they took it, but now . . . how could Jiang Zhen give him money in private?\u201cEveryone should have some money on their hands, so that you can buy whatever you want. You gave me all your savings before. Now I\u2019m only giving you a part of mine, how can you not accept it?\u201d After Jiang Zhen accepted Zhao Jinge\u2019s money first, he didn\u2019t pay it back because he didn\u2019t have much money. Now that he had money, he had to let Zhao Jinge have some money too.\u201cTwenty silver is too much,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cJinge, if you don\u2019t take it, I\u2019ll take you to bed again,\u201d Jiang Zhen said with a smile.Zhao Jinge blushed and left with the silver in his hands. He wouldn\u2019t spend this money indiscriminately. First, he would find a place to hide the money, and when Jiang Zhen needed it, he would give it back to Jiang Zhen.Zhao Jinge sneaked back to his house and found that his mother was no longer in his room. When he thought of what he had done, he immediately felt ashamed. But he didn\u2019t regret it and was very happy.\u201cBack . . .\u201d When Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui heard the noise coming from the room, their hearts felt overwhelmed.There were some people in this village who slept together in secret before they got married, but they didn\u2019t expect that their lovely son would do the same. They used to worry that even if their Jinge got married, he would be despised or rejected in the bridal chamber. But now, it seemed that they were really thinking too much.\u201cJiang Zhen made you new clothes and gave you a hairpin?\u201d Zhao Liu glanced at Zhao Jinge and noticed the difference in her son.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Jinge nodded.\u201cHe\u2019s good to you, and you should be good to him too,\u201d Zhao Liu said and found that her son seemed to be holding something. \u201cWhat are you holding in your hand?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s silver,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui\u2019s expressions became more complicated, but at the same time they felt completely relieved. Jiang Zhen was so generous to their Jinge, which showed that he had really taken Jinge to his heart.Early the next morning, Zhao Liu got up and started busying herself. She cooked a pot of dry rice, steamed some salted fish on the steaming rack, opened the soybean oil brought by Jiang Zhen yesterday, and then fried a large plate of eggs in oil. In addition, she opened a jar of pickled mustard stored in her pantry, cut it into thin shreds and mixed it in the bowl with the seaweed.When Jiang Zhen came to the Zhaos\u2019 house, the table was full of dishes. Having been away from home for more than twenty days, although they bought meat to eat, neither Jiang Zhen nor Wang Haisheng was very good at cooking. The food they ate was very simple. The food prepared by Zhao Liu was so delicious that Jiang Zhen could not help swallowing his saliva.However, there was still something lacking in Zhao Liu\u2019s cooking . . . She had been living in the countryside, and had not much contact with any spices or eaten many good things. What she could prepare were only a few homemade dishes using spices and vinegar since other seasonings couldn\u2019t be bought often by farmers, so she didn\u2019t know how to use them. Hence, there was no vinegar in the cold seaweeds.\u201cMom, Dad, Jinge. Today, let\u2019s go to Zhao Dahu\u2019s house first to let Jinge quit his job. Then we can go to the county town again,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.One of the main reasons why he asked Zhao Fugui to buy land was that he wanted Zhao Jinge to stop working as a long-term worker for Zhao Dahu\u2019s family. Although he would be tired working in his own field, at least he could go there whenever he wanted to. He could also just hide at home at noon during the hot summer. He couldn\u2019t do that while he was a long-term worker in someone else\u2019s house.\u201cAlright.\u201d Zhao Fugui pondered for a moment and nodded. Jinge used to work as a long-term worker, but this time, he was getting married. He should have children in the future, so it would be good to take care of that first . . .Zhao Fugui nodded his head, and the Zhao family together with Jiang Zhen went to Zhao Dahu\u2019s house. By this time, the people in the village had already gotten up, and many people saw the Zhao family. At first glance, it seemed nothing unusual, but when they looked more carefully, they were a bit surprised.Zhao Jinge used to do farm work all day long, which left his body covered in mud all the time. But now . . . he was wearing new clothes and had a silver hairpin in his hair. He looked very lively, and they discovered that he didn\u2019t look as ugly as they thought. Of course, he still looked very much like a man, there was no doubt about that. In other words, if he was a man, even if his family was poor, maybe there would be some women who would like his face and would be willing to marry him.\u201cThat Zhao Jinge is really beautifully dressed.\u201d\u201cThen Zhao Liu may be right. Jiang Zhen . . . Maybe he is really good to him.\u201d\u201cDoes Jiang Zhen really want to go to the Zhaos\u2019 house? Although he has no land, he has more money than the Zhao family. How could he want to be married in?\u201d. . .People looked at the Zhao family and Jiang Zhen with bewilderment, wondering what Jiang Zhen was doing. By that time, Jiang Zhen had already brought the Zhao family to Zhao Dahu\u2019s house.Jiang Zhen wanted Zhao Jinge to quit his job, and the process went very smoothly. Although the Zhao family had some money, they had no real power. It was obvious that, even though they hired Zhao Jinge as a long-term worker, they didn\u2019t want to offend Jiang Zhen under any circumstances. They were afraid that Jiang Zhen would start giving them a hard time, so they even gave Zhao Jinge that year\u2019s salary even though he only worked for three or four months. Of course, after Jiang Zhen and the Zhao family left, they were very angry, but they wouldn\u2019t let others know that.It was hard to find a long-term worker like Zhao Jinge, who worked hard and did a good job. So when Zhao Jinge quit suddenly, it seemed that Zhao Dahu\u2019s family would be busy in the near future.After quitting his job, they intended to go to the country town. But before going to the county town, Zhao Fugui proposed to visit the village head first.If their family wanted to buy land, it was better to buy it within the village. That way, it would be closer to their home. If they wanted to buy land in the village, they could go to the house of the village head to ask about land available for sale at the moment.There were very few people in Hexi who wanted to buy or sell land. Although Zhao Fugui said that he would go to the village head to inquire about it, he did not have much hope. However, the result was beyond his expectations. In their Hexi there was indeed someone who wanted to sell land!\u201cSince the land of Butcher Jiang\u2019s family couldn\u2019t be planted, he wanted to sell 4 mu of paddy field, and he also happened to be in a hurry,\u201d the village head Jiang Ping said while glancing at Jiang Zhen\u2019s face with a look of surprise.Because he was the village head, when Jiang Zhen did those things before, everyone asked him to reason with him, so he had met Jiang Zhen several times. This experience made him a bit afraid of Jiang Zhen. He also felt that Jiang Zhen was going to become a big bully in the village, harming the villagers. However, he didn\u2019t expect that he not only didn\u2019t commit evil deeds in the village, but even stood up when Liu Heitou came to their village to kidnap people. Now he was even going to buy land for the Zhao family.He . . . Was he trying to live a good life with Zhao Jinge? If so, it would be great.\u201cYes, but maybe they wouldn\u2019t want to sell it to us. Village head, please don\u2019t tell them yet it\u2019s us who want to buy the land,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.It was a bit of a surprise to him that the Jiang family wanted to sell the land. However, no matter why the Jiang family wanted to sell it, he wanted to buy it. He didn\u2019t know what kind of expression the Jiang family would have when they learned he was the one who bought the land.The Jiang family was not the only one selling land in the village. There was another family who also planned to sell a piece of dryland. The price for the dryland was divided in different categories. Land that was fertile or planted with mulberry trees wasn\u2019t cheap. It cost at least ten silver per 1 mu of land, but some land was very cheap and could be bought very cheaply.The land was very large with an area of 20 mu, but one couldn\u2019t grow much on it because there was a bamboo forest with many trees. If they wanted to use this kind of land to grow things, they must first dig out the bamboo wood, but that was a very troublesome process. Even if they cleared the land, the soil would not be fertile. Even if they wanted to dispose of this wasteland, no one would want to buy it.This land couldn\u2019t sell for a long time, Jiang Zhen recalled, but suddenly thought of something. \u201cThere seems to be a small pond in that land?\u201d\u201cYes, there is a pond. It appears to be about two or three mu. You can actually grow water bamboo and water chestnuts. That is very good.\u201d Jiang Ping coughed a few times. \u201cBecause there is water over there, the price is not cheap. It costs 40 silver for 20 mu of land.\u201d In fact, the originally set price was a bit higher, but no one was interested in buying it all this time, so it was lowered, yet the price was still a little high.Although this land produced bamboo and water chestnuts, there was also an ownerless bamboo forest near Hexi. Who would want to buy this bamboo forest in that situation?\u201cI want this land,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. The people of Hexi didn\u2019t think that this land was useful at all, but he thought it was very good . . . especially suitable for raising chicken and ducks. Besides, it was too cheap.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although he could dig some bamboo shoots and grow some water bamboo shoots to sell for money, it would not only take time but also a lot of effort and might earn them less than one or two silver a year. What can you do with such land?\u201cI think it\u2019s a good place to raise ducks,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.He didn\u2019t want Zhao Jinge to work as a long-term worker, nor did he want Zhao Fugui to work as a short-term worker, so he found something to do for them. It was a good idea to raise chicken and ducks. This way, in two or three months, the family wouldn\u2019t be short of chicken and duck eggs.Zhao Fugui thought that raising chicken and ducks would not require such a large piece of land, but thought that it was Jiang Zhen\u2019s silver anyway. He stopped talking.After negotiating with Jiang Ping to buy the Jiang family\u2019s paddy fields and that piece of dryland, they considered going to the county town to see if there was any other land for sale. Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu looked at each other and refused to go to the county town.Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge were going to get married. It was alright to go to the county town to have a look. The better-off families would take their future daughter-in-law to the county town to buy some things before the marriage. At this time . . . what would the two old ones do with them? So on the trip to the county town, only Zhao Jinge and Jiang Zhen went. Before leaving, Jiang Zhen brought some porcelain with him.There was a porcelain shop in the county town, which mainly sold very cheap bowls and dishes. When people went there to buy bowls, the shopkeeper would engrave a mark in the bottom.In this era, when people threw wedding parties, they needed to borrow tables, chairs, and dishes from others. After they were done, they needed to return them\u2014after all, this was one of the most important properties of many families, so they had to be marked.Jiang Zhen first looked around the shop and asked about the price of porcelain. Then he took out the porcelain dishes he had brought for the shopkeeper to see and asked him what price he was willing to pay for it.\u201cThis porcelain is of good quality,\u201d the shopkeeper said as soon as he saw the porcelain that Jiang Zhen took out.\u201cYes, the purchase price was not cheap,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cHow many do you have? If the price is right, I\u2019ll take them all,\u201d the shopkeeper said.\u201cI have a large number of them on my ship. As for the price . . . Shopkeeper, how about this? You help me contact the buyer and negotiate the price, and then I\u2019ll bring the goods to sell to them. As for the selling price, you\u2019ll take one silver out of ten.\u201d Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know the market price of porcelain. Most of the people who rashly sold it to the shopkeeper would lose money, so he simply thought of such a way.If the shopkeeper wanted a bigger cut, he would definitely raise the price a little higher.\u201cThis . . .\u201d The shopkeeper had never sold anything this way, so he was a bit hesitant.\u201cShopkeeper, you will earn 10 percent out of nothing. Of course, don\u2019t try to fool me. I just want to sell it for a good price. If the price is not right, I won\u2019t sell it at all,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.After thinking about it for a moment, the shopkeeper agreed to Jiang Zhen\u2019s request. Although the porcelain brought by Jiang Zhen was not particularly expensive, it was still good and pretty rare there.Jiang Zhen\u2019s porcelain was not very expensive, but it was really of good quality. At least, they hadn\u2019t seen much of it there. If he were to show it to the mistresses of several big families in the county town, he was sure he would sell it for a good price.With the shopkeeper\u2019s consent, Jiang Zhen left the samples and then told the shopkeeper the quantity of each plate in his hand, leaving his own address as well.After doing that, Jiang Zhen wanted to take Zhao Jinge to a restaurant in the county town for a meal. There was only one big restaurant in the county town and the food there was not cheap. Just as Jiang Zhen proposed to go, Zhao Jinge refused. \u201cI don\u2019t want to eat there. Let\u2019s eat wonton.\u201d\u201cWonton?\u201d Jiang Zhen was stunned. \u201cJinge, you don\u2019t have to save my money.\u201d\u201cI really like to eat wonton. When I was a kid, every time father brought me to the county town, he would buy me a bowl of wonton,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.Jiang Zhen knew that Zhao Jinge mainly wanted to save money, but he didn\u2019t refuse him. So he took Zhao Jinge to the wonton stall.Wonton was divided into two kinds. One was the big wonton with thick skin and meat, which was more expensive and cost six copper pennies for one bowl or ten copper pennies for a bowl with meat. The other kind was the small wonton that was very thin with pieces of meat inside the size of mung beans. This bowl cost only about two copper pennies and usually needed some extra meat buns to satisfy the customer\u2019s hunger.Zhao Jinge ordered two bowls of small wonton, and Jiang Zhen asked for ten meat buns, which could be taken back with them in case they couldn\u2019t finish eating them afterwards.A bowl of small wonton was worth two copper pennies and a bowl of fist-sized meat buns was worth three copper pennies. Jiang Zhen ate three meat buns with a bowl of wonton in order to get full. Zhao Jinge ate the same amount, so they wrapped the remaining four steamed buns in oiled paper.When he brought Zhao Jinge to the county town, he intended to buy something for Zhao Jinge, but Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t want anything. After purchasing goods in Fucheng, he couldn\u2019t think of anything else he should buy. At last, he just bought two kilos of meat and another plate of pig liver.After buying the pig liver, Jiang Zhen saw that pig\u2019s trotters were cheap, so he bought two more pig\u2019s trotters and asked the butcher to cut them into pieces.\u201cZhao Jinge?\u201d a voice could be heard suddenly. Zhao Jinge, who was standing beside Jiang Zhen, turned his head and saw a woman in her thirties standing not far away.\u201cSister,\u201d Zhao Jinge called and looked at the woman opposite him.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you here . . . Do you want to buy some meat but have no money? Do you want me to lend you some?\u201d Liu Pandi looked at Zhao Jinge and asked.\u201cNo,\u201d Zhao Jinge refused.\u201cDon\u2019t say no. I know your family\u2019s life is not easy. Alas, you are too old to still find a mother-in-law and need to work for another family all day . . . \u201d Liu Pandi said, looking at Zhao Jinge with some pride. However, this close look made her eyebrows wrinkle slightly.This Liu Pandi was the eldest daughter of Zhao Jinge\u2019s uncle and was the same age as Zhao Jinge. When she was a child, she was very jealous of Zhao Jinge, who was loved by his parents. When she grew up, she married well in the county town, while Zhao Jinge never got married. She felt more and more superior to Zhao Jinge.It was her great regret that Zhao Liu basically cut off contact with her family, so she would casually send Zhao Jinge some food for the Chinese New Year, in order to let Zhao Jinge see how well she was doing.Today, when she saw Zhao Jinge, she was happy at first, but soon felt that something was not right. Today, Zhao Jinge was dressed up, looking very lively. There was even a silver hairpin in his hair.\u201cZhao Jinge, I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re wearing a silver hairpin! Is my aunt finally helping you find your mother-in-law\u2019s family?\u201d Liu Pandi asked again. That silver hairpin shouldn\u2019t have been bought by the Zhao family. Zhao Jinge was getting married? \u201cAre you filling in a house or marrying an old man? You are already so old, but that family is willing to give you a silver hairpin. It must be in poor condition, isn\u2019t it?\u201dLiu Pandi seemed to be guessing, but in fact, she was very sure. She thought that Zhao Jinge might marry some stupid madman. If not, why would they buy Zhao Jinge a silver hairpin?Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t have much contact with this cousin of his. In fact, at the beginning, he hadn\u2019t discovered that this cousin bore malice towards him, but now he also felt something was wrong and couldn\u2019t help frowning.\u201cJinge, I\u2019ve bought the meat. What else do you want? Let\u2019s go buy it.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled and looked at Liu Pandi. \u201cWho is this old woman? Do you know her?\u201d\u201cThis is my cousin,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cOh, she was a cousin. I thought she was an aunt,\u201d Jiang Zhen sneered.Liu Pandi was nearly furious. The situation of her husband\u2019s family was really very good for showing off. But she had a powerful mother-in-law who was always dissatisfied with the fact that her family had asked for too many betrothal gifts, so she treated her harshly, aging her. But even so, she was still only one year older than Zhao Jinge. How did she become an aunt?Liu Pandi wanted to say something more, but Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t pay any attention to her and had already pulled Zhao Jinge away. Liu Pandi looked at Zhao Jinge\u2019s back and could not help frowning. Could Zhao Jinge really be getting married? It couldn\u2019t be true! She must go back and ask!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 71": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 54.2 - \u2013 Jiang Zhen became richPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 54.2 \u2013 Jiang Zhen became richJiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t spend so much time in the county town and went back early. Meanwhile, the village head, Jiang Ping, had already gone to the Jiang family house and talked about the fact that someone wanted to buy their land.At first, Jiang Ping was worried that the Jiang family would ask who was willing to buy the land, but unexpectedly, the Jiang family didn\u2019t ask.\u201cSomeone wants to buy it? What is the price?\u201d old Madam Jiang asked.\u201cTwenty silver for 1 mu of land. Your land is not the best and there are no crops on it, so I couldn\u2019t sell it any more expensive,\u201d Jiang Ping said.Old lady Jiang immediately hesitated, while Butcher Jiang smoked in silence.\u201cDo you really want to sell the land? It\u2019s hard to buy land after it\u2019s sold . . . \u201d Jiang Ping advised them. Land was the lifeblood of the villagers! Except for Zhao Liu who was ill and waiting for life-saving help, or He Qiusheng\u2019s father who owed money due to gambling debts that could potentially get his head chopped off, no one was willing to sell land.The Jiang family didn\u2019t have a lot of land before. They had 4 or 5 mu of paddy fields plus a few mu of dryland. It took Butcher Jiang a lot of effort to increase his family\u2019s properties, which they possessed today. Who didn\u2019t envy the Jiang family for having 15 mu of paddy field? Unexpectedly, they were willing to sell 4 mu in one breath.\u201cSell! We want to sell,\u201d Butcher Jiang affirmed. He was so upset that he didn\u2019t even ask who wanted to buy it.There were several reasons why the Jiang family wanted to sell the land. One of the reasons was that they couldn\u2019t plant it. Rice was very troublesome to grow. First, you have to turn the ground over and over again, and then you have to raise and transplant seedlings, and then you have to keep weeding it . . . In the past, Eldest Jiang and Butcher Jiang went to the fields together. When they were busy, old lady Jiang would plant the rice. But now, they couldn\u2019t plant all the land. Of course, if they couldn\u2019t plant the rice, they could always rent the field to someone else. Some people in the village had little land and wished that someone would rent them a field, but . . . Jiang Chengxiang and Jiang Chengwen had asked them for money.The cause of this matter was that Jiang Chengxiang had found a job in the county town, but he needed twenty silver to secure it, so he came home to ask for silver. Butcher Jiang hoped that he could find a good job, so he promised to find a way for him and give him 22 silver. As a result, Jiang Chengwen overheard this and was very dissatisfied.In the past Jiang Chengwen went to school for less than two years, while Jiang Chengxiang studied for six or seven years. The Jiang family spent more money on Jiang Chengxiang than on Jiang Chengwen. But after Jiang Chengxiang became successful, he didn\u2019t give any money to his family.Jiang Chengwen thought that they were both the Jiang family\u2019s sons. Butcher Jiang gave Jiang Chengxiang so much money to study and then gave him money to find a job, so why didn\u2019t he give any to him? Then he immediately asked his parents for forty-two silver, saying that he would use it to start his own business.Both Jiang Chengwen and Jiang Chengxiang desperately asked for money, but at the same time, someone came to collect debts. Despite all kinds of mistreatment that Eldest Jiang had suffered, Butcher Jiang and old lady Jiang really loved Jiang Chengwen and Jiang Chengxiang very much. At last, the couple discussed the matter and decided to sell the land.After selling the land, they would give Jiang Chengxiang twenty silver to secure the job, and then they would give Jiang Chengwen forty silver to start a business. The rest would be used to pay off the debts.Old lady Jiang had always been full of confidence in her son, Jiang Chengwen. Even though her son was lazy, she firmly believed that he would be able to do business and make a lot of money.When old Madam Jiang and Butcher Jiang agreed to sell the land, Jiang Ping went to the Zhaos\u2019 house again.Jiang Ping was trustworthy. With Jiang Zhen around, Zhao Fugui was not afraid of him tricking his family. He just simply gave Jiang Ping the money and asked him to buy the land.Jiang Ping had always been a good man, so he didn\u2019t refuse. He also helped with the purchase of the 20 mu of bamboo forest for the Zhao family.The next day, Jiang Zhen got the title deed. He just glanced at it and gave the deed to Zhao Jinge. At the same time, the story that the Zhao family had bought the land also spread around Hexi. No, it shouldn\u2019t be said that the Zhao family bought the land, but that Jiang Zhen bought the land for them.When Jiang Zhen left the Jiang family house, he had only forty silver on his hands. But now, he alone could buy 4 mu of paddy field! By marrying him, if nothing else, Zhao Jinge wouldn\u2019t have to go hungry in the future!Before, people in Hexi were afraid of Jiang Zhen. But now, when they went to see Jiang Zhen again, they found out that Jiang Zhen did nothing terrible. He was even very good to Zhao Jinge . . . Hadn\u2019t they seen Zhao Jinge always wearing new clothes now? The Zhao family also ate meat every day. That Zhao Liu used to be very thin, but now, she not only had a ruddy complexion but also wore rouge!For a while, people envied the Zhao family. When they envied the Zhao family, they had to mention the Jiang family and sympathized with them.When Jiang Zhen was in the Jiang family, he worked hard and did all the work in the fields, letting the Jiang family live a very good life. But the Jiang family used to pick on him and drove him out. Now that Jiang Zhen had gone to the Zhao family\u2019s house, the life of the Jiang family turned sad while the Zhaos\u2019 household prospered.In the past, people in the village were afraid of Jiang Zhen. When they fought with Jiang Zhen and the yamen was called, they were scared that it would affect them a lot. Now they noticed that Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t seem to cause any trouble in the village, so they no longer feared him. Of course, they were still in awe of him, so no one dared to offend him.Many people came to the Zhao family to inquire about the news. Zhao Liu raised her head and boasted proudly about Jiang Zhen, \u201cWhen the land was bought yesterday, my Jinge wanted to go plant the land. But it turned out, Jiang Zhen refused to let him go and said that he was going to get married soon. \u2018How could you do such rough work?\u2019 So this year, we can only grow one season of rice.\u201d\u201cBefore, when we weren\u2019t well-off, we thought pig\u2019s head meat tasted good. Today, Jiang Zhen went to the county town to send some porcelain and brought back a pig\u2019s head . . . Really, such a big pig\u2019s head. How can the few people in our family finish eating it?\u201d\u201cHe also gave me this rouge. At first, he only gave me this box of rouge, but recently, he also gave me a box of eyebrow powder.\u201d\u201cMy Jinge is doing nothing at home all day now. If it continues like this, he will get lazy.\u201dJiang Zhen overheard the praise and was immediately speechless. Zhao Liu praised him, but also boasted a bit too much . . .Jiang Zhen did not let Zhao Jinge farm, but Zhao Jinge was by no means idle. Not only was he cooking all the meals at home, but he also collected snails by the river every day and then raised them in the pond of the bamboo forest, waiting for the ducks to eat them later.If Jiang Zhen hadn\u2019t stopped him, he would have dug out all the mud in the pond and filled it with the land from the bank of the pond, so they could have a piece of fertile land that could grow crops. However, the feeling of being praised was not bad, so Jiang Zhen went to work with a smile on his face.Zhao Liu\u2019s face was full of spring every day, making her whole person seem ten years younger. Meanwhile, the Jiang family were experiencing the opposite.Their land was bought by Jiang Zhen. This . . . This . . .Old lady Jiang\u2019s heart was filled with so much anger that even her liver hurt, and she kept scolding. At first, Butcher Jiang was alright with it. He thought that his land was in the hands of his own family and not some cheap outsiders. But as soon as he heard that Jiang Zhen was going to marry into the Zhaos\u2019 house, he trembled in anger. The land of his family was going to become the Zhao family\u2019s!\u201cMom, Dad, don\u2019t worry. If that Jiang Zhen can make money to buy land, so can I,\u201d Jiang Chengwen said to his parents. \u201cIn the beginning, Jiang Zhen was doing business with forty silver. He turned them around and made so much money . . . I\u2019m sure I can do it too!\u201d\u201cYes, you can do it too!\u201d Old lady Jiang said to Jiang Chengwen. After that, her mood improved.. . .He was about to get married, but Jiang Zhen was still busy. Together with Wang Haisheng, he went to the bamboo forest he just bought and made a bamboo fence, trying to build a chicken coop and a duck coop.Ducks were not afraid of rain, so their coop could be simple. But the chicken coop needed to be well-built. This project was not a small one, so Jiang Zhen thought it would be better to do it after he got married. Now his main task was to level the land.At present it was only the fourth month of the lunar calendar, but the weather was already hot. Jiang Zhen had only been working for a while, but he couldn\u2019t help taking off his clothes and going shirtless. It was common for men to go shirtless, not to mention, no one was around.\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d Jiang Zhen thought that no one would come here, but he heard the sound of rustling behind him, and immediately turned his head.\u201cIt . . . It\u2019s me. \u201c He Qiusheng came out of the bushes.After not seeing him for a few days, He Qiusheng looked haggard. He didn\u2019t dare to look at the shirtless Jiang Zhen and lowered his head.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Jiang Zhen frowned slightly and put on his clothes again.\u201cI . . .\u201d He Qiusheng clenched his teeth and could not speak.He Qiusheng came here because his parents had forced him to. He hadn\u2019t suffered many grievances as a child. Although Jiang Zhen saved him and made him have a good feeling for Jiang Zhen, after being ignored by Jiang Zhen, he didn\u2019t want to stick his hot face on his cold shoulder, but his parents didn\u2019t think so.Although Jiang Zhen beat up Liu Heitou, Liu Heitou still wanted their family to pay off their debts. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t help them to solve this problem, that is to say . . . Liu Heitou would still come to ask for the money that his father owed!Father He was feeling restless these days. Although he had owed money before, he could send He Qiusheng as payment for his debts. But after Jiang Zhen beat up Liu Heitou, he no longer wanted He Qiusheng but wanted him to pay off his debt . . . Where would all of this come from?Father He was afraid that Liu Heitou would come to make trouble for him, so he told He Qiusheng to go to Jiang Zhen for help. Jiang Zhen could beat Liu Heitou; it should be enough for Liu Heitou to stop asking for the repayment of the debt, right? After all, after borrowing Liu Heitou\u2019s money, he gambled all his money away in Liujia Village, and many of the people who gambled with him were Liu Heitou\u2019s people. That was to say . . . as it happened, that 30 silver went to Liu Heitou\u2019s pocket again.As long as Jiang Zhen went to talk to them about it, he would certainly be able to get rid of his debts! Father He had such an idea, but he didn\u2019t dare to go to Jiang Zhen, so he sent He Qiusheng. After learning that Jiang Zhen bought land and had money on his hands, he asked He Qiusheng to snatch Jiang Zhen. He\u2019d better squeeze out that Zhao Jinge and marry Jiang Zhen himself, so that their family would have nothing to worry about in the future.He Qiusheng felt very embarrassed, but his mother agreed. He Qiusheng\u2019s mother was a very weak but also a very good woman. She was very good to her three children and her husband. She always regarded her husband as God. Now that her husband got into trouble with Liu Heitou and her family couldn\u2019t solve this problem, she pinned all her hopes on He Qiusheng and asked him to beg Jiang Zhen for help.Well, since Jiang Zhen saved He Qiusheng, he must have been fond of him for some time. He was marrying Zhao Jinge only because Zhao Jinge saved him before . . . Mother He thought it would be useful for He Qiusheng to give it a try. However, Mother He didn\u2019t ask He Qiusheng to squeeze out Zhao Jinge. She thought it would be better to be Jiang Zhen\u2019s concubine than Liu Heitou\u2019s. At least, Jiang Zhen wouldn\u2019t torture his concubine to death. Therefore, she asked He Qiusheng to keep a low profile, when he went to meet Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge.He Qiusheng could refuse his father, but he couldn\u2019t refuse his mother\u2019s tears. After that, He Qiusheng came to meet him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He had never had the patience to deal with others unless it was Zhao Jinge.\u201cBoss Jiang, can you help me? My father owes Liu Heitou money. He won\u2019t leave our family alone,\u201d He Qiusheng said. He lowered his head, and he felt a bit embarrassed at the thought of his parents\u2019 demands. He didn\u2019t want to steal other people\u2019s men, and he didn\u2019t think he could do it. As for being a concubine . . .He used to think that, as long as the man who proposed marriage to him had money, even if he was a bit older or if he wanted to marry him to fill a house, it would be fine, but he had never considered being a concubine.In Hexi, even Zhao Dahu only had one wife, but there were a few concubines in the county town. Yet, he heard that the life of the concubines in the county town was very difficult. It was just . . . if he wanted Jiang Zhen\u2019s help, he needed to pay a price, right? Their family had nothing to give except for him.He Qiusheng turned around various ideas in his mind, thinking about what to do next, when he heard Jiang Zhen say firmly, \u201cNot helping.\u201dAt the beginning, when Liu Heitou wanted to take He Qiusheng away, Jiang Zhen made a move because he felt that it was not good that He Qiusheng was being taken away as a minor. But it didn\u2019t help He Qiusheng let Liu Heitou write off the account. Even if he could repeat that situation now, there was no need for him to come up with the money.And there was a reason for this. Whether Liu Heitou had deliberately designed it or not, it was a fact that He Qiusheng\u2019s father borrowed money and was not forced to do so. He was in no position to let other people write off his debt. Moreover, he gave Liu Heitou some face this way. Even if Liu Heitou was beaten, he would not come to trouble him, if he found he was difficult to deal with. But he still had the help of his family if it went too far. Liu Heitou had a lot of people under him, and they all had a way of making trouble for him.Of course, there was another reason why he did that. He didn\u2019t want to be pestered by He Qiusheng\u2019s father. That kind of person, who knew clearly that his family had no money but still borrowed money in order to gamble, had no bottom line. He was capable of anything. If he were to help them pay off the gambling debt this time, next time, Father He would probably dare to borrow money everywhere under his name. When that time came and something happened to the He family again, would he have to help again?Jiang Zhen always felt that everyone was responsible for their own life, so when he rescued the two women from the hands of the water bandits, he let them go without saying anything. After he rescued He Qiusheng from Liu Heitou\u2019s hands, he did not care about their family\u2019s debt and let them handle it themselves.You can save others once, but not for a lifetime. If you want to live a good life, you still have to rely on yourself.\u201cLiu Heitou is vicious. He will kill my father, as well as my brothers and then . . .. You . . . I can do anything as long as you are willing to help,\u201d He Qiusheng said, summoning his courage to look at Jiang Zhen.\u201cI won\u2019t help,\u201d Jiang Zhen repeated. Now that he had someone, it was even less likely for him to help. He didn\u2019t want Zhao Jinge to misunderstand and be sad.\u201cWhy? Why don\u2019t you want to help me when you\u2019re so strong?\u201d He Qiusheng couldn\u2019t help asking.\u201cNo matter how powerful I am, I have nothing to do with you!\u201d Jiang Zhen said, ignoring him. Then he directly went to work on the other side. In his opinion, these fourteen or fifteen-year-olds were the most difficult ones to get along with. If it was not necessary, he didn\u2019t want to have contact with them at all.He Qiusheng looked at Jiang Zhen, who was ignoring him; he felt frustrated and walked away. He was obviously very good-looking, so why didn\u2019t this Jiang Zhen take him seriously? He wanted to go, but he thought of his mother, who had been wiping her tears these days, and his two brothers, who were already beaten up. He gritted his teeth and chased after him.\u201cBrother Jiang, please help me! Can\u2019t I pay you back later? My father borrowed thirty silver. As long as you make Liu Heitou remit the debt, I will pay you fifty silver later.\u201d He was good-looking and if he was merciless, even fifty silver would be offered as a bride price!Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t even bother to speak this time. It was not a question of silver at all. Old lady Jiang liked making trouble, but at least, she didn\u2019t gamble. But what about He Qiusheng\u2019s father? He was a bottomless hole. The He family didn\u2019t think of any way to deal with this bottomless hole, and kept trying to fill in the money, which would only make this bottomless hole grow bigger and bigger.\u201cBoss Jiang, you can beat up Liu Heitou. You are powerful. Please help me!\u201d He Qiusheng pleaded again.\u201cI didn\u2019t do it right at the beginning.\u201d Jiang Zhen was a bit annoyed. \u201cYou better get out of here quickly, or I\u2019ll beat you!\u201d When Jiang Zhen spoke, he pointed his axe at He Qiusheng. The cold and gleaming axe pointed at him startled him and he fell to the ground.Jiang Zhen left again, but He Qiusheng did not dare to follow him this time. He had no choice but to walk gloomily back to the village.When Zhao Liu came to deliver food to Jiang Zhen, she saw He Qiusheng at a glance and immediately felt a thumping in her heart. She also knew that Jiang Zhen had saved He Qiusheng from Liu Heitou. She wanted to ask Jiang Zhen, along with Zhao Fugui, about that yesterday, but Jiang Zhen gave them one hundred silver and they were so stunned that they forgot. Now . . . He Qiusheng came here to find Jiang Zhen, didn\u2019t he?Zhao Liu looked at Jiang Zhen, her future son-in-law, and the more she looked, the happier she was. Now she felt that Jiang Zhen was a piece of meat that everyone wanted to eat. He was immediately raised even higher in her heart.After passing by He Qiusheng, Zhao Liu quickly found Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen bought land with a tree forest on one side and a bamboo forest on the other. Because no one took care of them, the two forests had become too dense. Jiang Zhen planned to cut down some trees and some bamboo, so that the land below could have some sunshine. In the future, he would sweep away the leaves and the bamboo, and plant some seeds, so that green vegetables could be grown. The ducks and the chicken, they all could eat vegetables as well.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Wouldn\u2019t it be nicer if Zhao Jinge was the one to deliver his meal? He found a bird\u2019s nest before and picked up seven or eight eggs from it. He wanted to give them to Zhao Jinge.\u201cJiang Zhen, it is time to eat,\u201d Zhao Liu said and went to greet Wang Haisheng, who was working on the other side.In addition to the meal, Zhao Liu also delivered him water. Jiang Zhen and Wang Haisheng were really hungry and tired, so they ate and drank the water happily. When they had enough to eat and drink, Zhao Liu finally figured out what she was going to say to Jiang Zhen, but with Wang Haisheng around, she couldn\u2019t open her mouth, so she said, \u201cJiang Zhen, please show me this land!\u201dZhao Liu was not a person who could hide her emotions. Jiang Zhen could see everything on her face. Jiang Zhen knew that she had something to say, so he took her to the place where he planned to build a chicken coop.Sure enough, Zhao Liu soon said, \u201cJiang Zhen . . . What do you know about the He family? He Qiusheng\u2019s father is a waste that can\u2019t even support the walls of his own house. In his good days, he lost all his family\u2019s belongings. Those two boys of the He family are working hard to earn some money to buy food, but as soon as they turned around, he stole the grain and sold it for money.\u201dZhao Liu originally wanted to speak ill of He Qiusheng, but He Qiusheng didn\u2019t do anything bad, so she talked about He Qiusheng\u2019s father instead.\u201cHe is the kind of man that, when you get entangled with him, he will never let you go. When some kind hearted person lent him money once, he kept coming every day to borrow more. He even borrowed a hundred copper from our family and still hasn\u2019t paid it back!\u201d\u201cThis kind of person can even sell his own children, so it is best to stay away from him,\u201d Zhao Liu said again, racking her brains to talk more about the He family\u2019s bad circumstances.\u201cMom, I know,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. He didn\u2019t know why, but looking at Zhao Liu saying that there was something wrong with the He family, he always felt the urge to start laughing.Zhao Liu finally felt relieved. \u201cIt\u2019s good that you know. Please don\u2019t get entangled with them.\u201dJiang Zhen was confident. \u201cNo way.\u201d He didn\u2019t like He Qiusheng\u2019s style at all . . .Zhao Liu said all she wanted to say, but then, Jiang Zhen asked, \u201cMother, do you know anything about Liu Heitou\u2019s family?\u201dZhao Liu came from Qiaotou Village and had the same surname as Liu Heitou.\u201cAlthough I have the same surname, my family has nothing to do with his family. When I got married, Liu Heitou was barely able to walk, and his family was still poor. I didn\u2019t know him very well,\u201d Zhao Liu said. Liu Heitou, in her early thirties, had been a troublemaker for nearly ten years. In the following ten years, she had not much contact with her family.Jiang Zhen did not intend to ask Zhao Liu anything more. He just spoke to Zhao Liu casually and went to work again.Zhao Liu returned home with the basket, thought about it over and over again, and still did not feel at ease. Finally, she slapped her thigh and called Zhao Jinge, who was building a mud stove.\u201cMom, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked. There was only one stove in their family before, and they could only use one iron pot on it. Now that Jiang Zhen had bought another iron pot, he and Zhao Fugui worked together to rebuild the stove.This job dealt with mud, and Zhao Jinge was covered in mud at the moment. Zhao Liu looked at her son and recalled what He Qiusheng looked like when she saw him before. She couldn\u2019t help but start worrying again.\u201cJinge, don\u2019t do this. Go and wash yourself and change into the new clothes that Jiang Zhen bought for you, then bring water to Jiang Zhen,\u201d Zhao Liu said.Zhao Jinge was confused. He just wanted to deliver food to Jiang Zhen, but Zhao Liu stopped him and refused to let him go. How could he deliver water now?Zhao Fugui also said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you just deliver him water? I still need Jinge\u2019s help here.\u201d\u201cIt must be sent over even If I just delivered some water. Let me help you.\u201d Zhao Liu rolled up her sleeves.Zhao Jinge and Zhao Fugui didn\u2019t know why, but at Zhao Liu\u2019s insistence, Zhao Jinge took a bath and went to Jiang Zhen with some water.When Jiang Zhen saw that Zhao Jinge came shortly after Zhao Liu left, he felt the urge to laugh.With Wang Haisheng around, Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t flirt with Zhao Jinge. He just gave Zhao Jinge the bird eggs he got and the snake he caught. He asked Zhao Jinge to take it back in order to add more variety to their food. He also gave Zhao Jinge a handful of wildflowers he picked before and asked him to take them back and keep them in a bamboo tube.Zhao Jinge came here especially to deliver water and went back soon after.Zhao Liu couldn\u2019t help Zhao Fugui at all. She was not in the mood to help either and was waiting for Zhao Jinge\u2019s return. Seeing Zhao Jinge come back with a bouquet of flowers, bird eggs, and a snake, she finally felt relieved. Before, He Qiusheng left empty-handed. As expected, Jiang Zhen left the best to her Jinge.Wait. Wait a minute. These bird eggs, snake, and these flowers were not all things that Jiang Zhen got in that short time, right? In that case, just now, why didn\u2019t Jiang Zhen give her something? She also left empty-handed . . .On the Zhao family\u2019s side, Zhao Liu was just a bit depressed. On the side of the He family, Father He was scolding He Qiusheng that he was no good. He couldn\u2019t even handle Eldest Jiang, who had never seen the world before.He Qiusheng\u2019s mother was usually very fond of him, but now that Father He was angry, she didn\u2019t even dare to say a single word.She just cried while trying to persuade him, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go to meet Eldest Jiang once again? Qiusheng, mother really can\u2019t help you . . .\u201dHe Qiusheng didn\u2019t want to lose face. Jiang Zhen had pointed an axe at him. How could he be willing. He refused without even thinking about it.When Father He saw this, he jumped up, trying to slap He Qiusheng, but was stopped by He Chunsheng.These days, the life of He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng was also very difficult. Their resentment towards their father was growing bigger day by day.Father He was pushed to the ground, and He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng pulled their younger brother out of the house.\u201cQiusheng, when we went to the county town before, didn\u2019t the son of the bakery owner like you very much? He even came to see you later . . . Marry him. If you go to the county town, Liu Heitou won\u2019t dare to do anything to you,\u201d He Chunsheng said. No matter how fierce Liu Heitou was in the countryside, he wouldn\u2019t dare to make trouble in the county town. If He Qiusheng were to go to the county town, he would certainly be able to avoid him. As for their family . . . He Qiusheng was the only ger in their family, so there was nothing to worry about.The son of the bakery owner was the best of all the people who liked He Qiusheng, but there was more than one son in his family and the baker\u2019s wife was very young and powerful, so He Qiusheng didn\u2019t want to marry him before. But now . . .\u201cThen what are you going to do?\u201d He Qiusheng cried again.\u201cThere is always a way,\u201d He Chunsheng said, wiping his eyes.In fact, He Chunsheng was also one of the old bachelors who couldn\u2019t get a wife in Hexi. He was already twenty-three years old, but no one had ever talked about marriage with him.No, as a matter of fact, there were still some people who had taken a fancy to He Qiusheng and wanted to exchange marriage with his family. But when he heard that He Qiusheng was going to be exchanged for some woman, he kicked them out.\u201cThen let\u2019s think of another way! I\u2019ll go find Eldest Jiang again,\u201d He Qiusheng said, before his father was troubled by Liu Heitou. Though he really didn\u2019t care about him, he still had a mother and two brothers.\u201cAbout Eldest Jiang . . . Qiusheng, what did Eldest Jiang say when you went to see him before?\u201d He Chunsheng asked.At home, He Qiusheng did not want to be laughed at by his own father, so he only said that Jiang Zhen was unwilling, but now, with his brothers, he told the whole story in detail. Jiang Zhen\u2019s words were repeated one by one.He Chunsheng listened. At first, he felt wronged for his brother but finally could not help becoming quiet and murmuring, \u201cDidn\u2019t do it right at the beginning?\u201dIt suddenly occurred to him that he and He Xiasheng despised the former Eldest Jiang, who was bullied all day and had a life even worse than his and He Xiasheng\u2019s. But now? Jiang Zhen was not afraid of Liu Heitou.He didn\u2019t do it right at the beginning . . . Well . . . Could they become as good as Eldest Jiang?\u201cQiusheng, you go to our uncle\u2019s house. I and Xiasheng will figure out a way,\u201d He Chunsheng said.He Qiusheng was persuaded to go to their uncle\u2019s house by his two brothers. He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng went to find Jiang Zhen together.Jiang Zhen was about to finish work and go home, when he saw He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng, and immediately frowned. \u201cYou guys are not done yet?\u201d\u201cBoss Jiang, can you teach us how to be powerful?\u201d He Chunsheng asked.Jiang Zhen raised his eyebrows in surprise. He Chunsheng pulled He Xiasheng and himself to their knees and asked again, \u201cBoss Jiang, teach us how to fight! We don\u2019t want to go on like this anymore!\u201dWith that, He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng kowtowed to Jiang Zhen together.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They had been as distressed as headless chickens before, but after hearing what Jiang Zhen said and thinking about what happened to him, the He brothers suddenly felt a sense that a fog dispelling before them.Jiang Zhen was often beaten and got almost killed before, but it was not Liu Heitou who did it; it was just old Madam Jiang. Later, Jiang Zhen took care of everything, and no one dared to mess with him. If they could learn as well as Jiang Zhen, would they need to be afraid of Liu Heitou?He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng didn\u2019t know how to become like Jiang Zhen. After thinking about it, they simply went to find Jiang Zhen, hoping that Jiang Zhen could show them a way.\u201cBoss Jiang, please teach us,\u201d He Chunsheng said again.Jiang Zhen looked at the two men in front of him and frowned slightly. \u201cCome here to help me with the work early tomorrow.\u201dAfter saying that, Jiang Zhen immediately went back to the Zhaos\u2019 house.\u201cWork? Big Brother . . .\u201d He Xiasheng always listened to He Chunsheng when they did things. But this time he looked at He Chunsheng curiously. What did Jiang Zhen mean when he asked them to come to work? Did he promise to teach them?\u201cWe\u2019ll come early tomorrow. We need to work hard then!\u201d He Chunsheng said to He Xiasheng.\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cIf we want to learn from others, we must work first. And it will still be fine if he doesn\u2019t pay us!\u201d He Chunsheng said. At this time, it was not only necessary to find a master to learn from but to also give a gift to show filial piety to their master during the Spring Festival.\u201cWhat about our family? If we don\u2019t go to work, we\u2019ll run out of food,\u201d He Xiasheng said.\u201cEven when we go to work, don\u2019t we still run out of food?\u201d He Chunsheng sneered. He and He Xiasheng worked hard and earned less than a few silver a year. But what about their father? He dared without even blinking an eye to borrow thirty silver from others.As it was, their father owed more than thirty silver; he borrowed from everyone he could! But other people saw that they didn\u2019t live well, so they didn\u2019t lend their father a lot of money. They also didn\u2019t come to their door to demand for repayment.He Xiasheng thought about it, but He Chunsheng said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Little brother won\u2019t go hungry. He will also give some food to our mother. As for the two of us, we can live by digging up some wild vegetables.\u201dWhile He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were discussing this matter, Jiang Zhen had already gone home.The eggs and the snake were all braised by Zhao Liu.Jiang Zhen bought some soy sauce when he came back. Then Zhao Liu fell in love with braised meat in soy sauce. Recently, all the meat they ate was simply braised.The sliced snake meat tasted very good. The bird\u2019s eggs that were cooked first and then peeled and opened for cooking also tasted great with the soup. In addition, there was also a bowl of stewed eggs, a bowl of boiled peas, a bowl of fried garlic sprouts, and a bowl of mustard soup on the table.A month ago, the garlic leaves were just right for eating, but since then, the garlic leaves had grown old. Garlic sprouts were growing out, and the garlic cloves below were also beginning to grow out. The tender garlic cloves were not very spicy, and if you liked them, you could make a drink with a piece of garlic.\u201cIn the past, I didn\u2019t eat like this even during the Spring Festival.\u201d Zhao Liu looked at the dishes she and Zhao Jinge cooked and sighed with emotion.\u201cWe will eat like this from now on.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled.\u201cHow could that be? You should also save some money. You\u2019d better buy more mu of land and leave it to your children in the future,\u201d Zhao Liu said.Although Jiang Zhen knew that Zhao Jinge was a ger and could have children, he never thought too much about it. So at this time, when he heard Zhao Liu talk about it, he didn\u2019t take it too seriously.It was only two days until his marriage, but Jiang Zhen still went to the field early the next morning and saw that He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were already working.Jiang Zhen had cut down a lot of bamboo the day before; the two men cut the bamboo in sections and arranged them for the fence.\u201cMaster,\u201d seeing Jiang Zhen, He Chunsheng shouted, and then looked at Jiang Zhen\u2019s expression, hoping that Jiang Zhen would reply.\u201cJust call me boss,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were a little frustrated; they thought that calling him boss was somewhat disrespectful. After all, the eldest children in the family would be often called boss by their younger siblings.But . . . when they heard Wang Haisheng call Jiang Zhen boss respectfully, they suddenly found that this title seemed to be quite imposing. He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng called out, \u201cBoss!\u201d just like this, and Jiang Zhen had two more people under him.Jiang Zhen saw that they knew how to protect their younger brother, so he had a good impression of them. Now, after observing them, he found that they were not bad people. Of course, he would take in these two little brothers even if they liked cheating and playing tricks as long as they didn\u2019t have the courage to play tricks on him. With this line of thoughts, Jiang Zhen also pointed out some things to the two men.Jiang Zhen always felt that children should be filial to their parents, but they should not be filial to the point of stupidity. Giving money to Father He for his old age was inevitable, but He Chunsheng and his brothers shouldn\u2019t give him money to let him continue gambling. It was not helping him; it was killing him. It was precisely because Father He had such children that he had the courage to borrow money from Liu Heitou.On the other hand, parents should behave the same way towards their children. If the children got in any trouble, it was alright to help them. But if they had any bad habits, the parents who not only didn\u2019t stop them but also kept giving them money . . . that was not love for their children at all. It was just harming them.Jiang Zhen was not a talkative person, and he wouldn\u2019t say too much on the first day, so he just said two sentences at random.\u201cWe didn\u2019t give him any money,\u201d He Chunsheng said. He really didn\u2019t give his father any money.\u201cYou knew that your mother would give your father everything, but you still gave your mother money. Didn\u2019t you just want to give your father money through her?\u201d Jiang Zhen sneered.He Chunsheng was speechless for a moment. He always thought that giving the money he earned to support his family was the right thing to do, and giving money to his mother was also the right thing to do, but now . . . Yeah, if he didn\u2019t give the money to his mother, he would have kept it himself . . . He and his brother had been working for six or seven years, so shouldn\u2019t they have been able to save twenty or thirty silver?Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t continue talking to them because Zhao Jinge arrived.\u201cJinge!\u201d When he saw Zhao Jinge, a smile appeared on Jiang Zhen\u2019s stiff face, and he walked towards Zhao Jinge.Check also my new novel: Devil Venerable Also Wants to KnowIn typical Mary-Sue novel, readers all like the second male lead who only loves the heroine wholeheartedly and is willing to give up everything for the heroine, but the heroine only loves the male lead who once abused her body and heart.Readers: Why doesn\u2019t the heroine love the second ML, the demon sect leader?!The demon sect leader: This Devil Venerable also wants to know, why do I like her?In order to find out why the female lead doesn\u2019t like him, the self-conscious demon sect leader set out to \u201cinterview\u201d all the characters in the novel.\u2014\u2014\u2014When a book was dropped into his lap, the demon sect leader discovered the world he lived in was described in it.

Although they had no intention of marrying their younger brother to Jiang Zhen, their parents had this idea, which made them even more embarrassed when they looked at Zhao Jinge.Zhao Jinge was stunned when he saw them. He didn\u2019t expect to see He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng working on his own land.\u201cIf they want to learn how to fight from me, they\u2019ll help with some work first,\u201d Jiang Zhen explained.After hearing Jiang Zhen\u2019s explanation, Zhao Jinge immediately breathed a sigh of relief. This was good. He had thought that He Qiusheng was in love with Jiang Zhen.Zhao Jinge came here to deliver food, but there was no share for He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng.When the He brothers saw that Jiang Zhen not only had a full-to-the-brim bowl of rice to eat at noon but also a bowl of fried garlic sprouts, salted vegetables, boiled broad beans, and stewed eggs, they couldn\u2019t help swallowing their saliva.\u201cThere are some peas growing over there. You can pick some of them and cook them,\u201d Jiang Zhen noticed their expression and pointed in the distance.Hearing his words, the He brothers really picked up some peas, put them in a bamboo tube, and threw them in the fire to cook. If the peas and the broad beans were any older, they could just pull out the whole peas and cook them on the fire, but for now they couldn\u2019t do it.Peas could be eaten even if they were not ripe. They picked some peas and padded their stomachs with them.The He brothers worked for Jiang Zhen for two days, but Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t teach them anything, and even Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t agree to bring them food. However, two days later, Jiang Zhen greeted them and asked them to go to the Zhao family\u2019s house for next day\u2019s wedding.\u201cCan we go?\u201d He Chunsheng looked at Jiang Zhen in surprise.\u201cYes,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, and then added, \u201cOnly you two can come.\u201d He felt that both Zhao Liu and Zhao Jinge were on guard against He Qiusheng, so he couldn\u2019t come. As for why He Chunsheng and his brother could come . . . it was because there were too few relatives in the Zhao family.They invited the village head, Jiang Ping\u2019s family, Zhao Fugui\u2019s relative, and several friends. But all of them added up, the total was less than three tables.It was a good thing to get married and have some fun. Jiang Zhen invited them, Wang Haisheng, and even Yang Jing, and asked him to come with his wife and children.On the wedding day, Jiang Zhen got up before dawn, and after getting up, he started . . . killing pigs.The people in Hexi who got married and had better living conditions all killed pigs. These pigs were called Xixi pigs.The groom\u2019s family would kill a pig and then send this whole pig to his future bride\u2019s house. The bride\u2019s family would take half of the pig and then send the remaining half back to the man\u2019s house with the pig\u2019s head. Then the meat would be used for the wedding banquet.Jiang Zhen thought that his family could not do without this, so he spent money on a pig. Because the weather was hot recently, he didn\u2019t kill the pig a day in advance but killed it single-handedly that morning. That was because there was no other way. There were too few relatives in the Zhao family who could help.\u201cIt is not good for the groom to see blood . . .\u201d Zhao Liu looked at Jiang Zhen and hesitated. How could the groom kill the pig himself?\u201cIt\u2019s alright. It was nice and fat, and that is a good sign.\u201dJiang Zhen added water and salt to the wooden bucket with the pig\u2019s blood and stirred it. After stirring the pig\u2019s blood with water and salt, it would condense after a while, then they could boil it with some water and, afterwards, pieces of blood tofu would come out. Its taste was pretty good. If the pig was killed here, they would usually share some pig\u2019s blood and pig intestines with their neighbors.\u201cIs that so?\u201d Zhao Liu was tricked and nodded.Because there were not many people invited to the wedding banquet, there were only five tables. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t kill any chicken and only prepared some fish.With pork and some fish, the wedding reception for him and Zhao Jinge was already very decent.After looking around, he found that everything he had to prepare was ready. Jiang Zhen breathed a sigh of relief. Then he went to take a bath and put on the set of clothes he had asked the tailor in Fucheng to make. Red wedding clothes could only be worn once. In this era, no one in the countryside would wear red clothes, so Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t have them made. Instead, he had two more sets of regular clothes made.These two sets of regular clothes were moon-white with a red accent\u2014it was bound to a dark red cloth and tied with a dark red waistband\u2014that represented happiness.Jiang Zhen\u2019s waist did not have any extra flesh. When he put on his clothes and tightened his belt, he immediately looked extremely energetic, and so did Zhao Jinge. Of course, Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t see Zhao Jinge at the moment.Last night, the Zhao family put the new bed, which had been specially made, in the new house. Then Zhao Jinge slept on it with Wang Daniu, Wang Haisheng\u2019s youngest son, to bless the bed.Obviously, having Wang Daniu sleep on his new bed in his house with his Zhao Jinge, Jiang Zhen felt a bit reluctant, but this was the tradition, so he couldn\u2019t do anything about it. In addition, there were also other customs. For example, last night, Jiang Zhen slept in the new house of the Zhaos while Zhao Jinge slept in his house.Today, he was busy in the Zhao family residence. After changing into new clothes, he would go from the Zhao family\u2019s house to his own house and then go to Zhao Jinge\u2019s house for the wedding. Then he needed to take Zhao Jinge back to the Zhao family\u2019s ancestral hall for worship. Even if it was a nuisance, a man still needed to do it when he married a woman or a ger.At around ten o\u2019clock in the morning, Jiang Zhen set out from the Zhao family\u2019s house to his own. He had no family, so he took a young man Zhao Fugui found for him and Wang Haisheng to welcome him together.In his house, Zhao Jinge was accompanied by Sun Xiaoshan, and a young woman from another village was already waiting.When other people got married, they would still ask for a red envelope in order to open the door. However, Zhao Jinge and Jiang Zhen\u2019s situation was different, which spared them all of that. At last, Jiang Zhen took Zhao Jinge back to the Zhaos\u2019 house with ease.There was no such thing as a sedan chair with a high roof or a big horse. Jiang Zhen led Zhao Jinge, who was covered in red fabric, and the two of them walked back, worshiped the ancestors, and finally got married.There were a few relatives of the Jiang family, but when they went to the hall, many villagers came to watch, and they all whispered when they looked at Zhao Jinge.\u201cZhao Jinge\u2019s clothes are really beautiful.\u201d\u201cIt was said that Jiang Zhen had these clothes made in Fucheng. Fucheng . . .\u201d\u201cJiang Zhen went especially to buy a pig. The wedding banquet of the Zhao family should be very magnificent.\u201d\u201cJiang Zhen has so much money now. It would be no problem for him to marry now. Why did he agree to marry in?\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, he is really capable. He used to be so silent in the Jiang family, but now, he has become rich as soon as he left the Jiang family.\u201d. . .The mood of the people present was somewhat complicated, and the most complicated feeling undoubtedly belonged to Butcher Jiang, who came here especially.Jiang Zhen was dressed in a new set of clothes. His expression was not as cold and stiff like it had been before. His whole person looked refreshing and handsome . . . and Butcher Jiang suddenly discovered that, out of his three sons, his eldest son was the one most like him. Speaking of which, it was Jiang Zhen who learned all his craftsmanship\u2014the butchering of pigs, farming, and everything else.Why did he use to think that his son was stupid and, therefore, always hated him? He had always been a neat worker. What was wrong with him?Butcher Jiang still disliked Jiang Zhen, but at the moment, he also had some problems with old Madam Jiang, who had always spoken ill of Jiang Zhen in front of him all day. If old Madam Jiang hadn\u2019t spoken ill of Jiang Zhen and about his wrongdoings all day, he would never have hated this son so much.Because Butcher Jiang came to the wedding banquet, old lady Jiang also came. But she did not think too much about it and kept telling people that Jiang Zhen was unfilial.There were still many people who agreed with her words. Although some people in the village admired Jiang Zhen, and some even envied him, they also felt that Jiang Zhen was unfilial. It was just . . . Jiang Zhen was so strong; no one dared to offend him.When old lady Jiang was saying that, Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge had already bowed in respect in the hall, and Jiang Zhen was leading Zhao Jinge into their new house. Outside, the banquet commenced.The Zhao family had also invited a cook, and now, all the dishes brought to the tables looked very attractive\u2014braised pork feet, braised kelp stew, braised pork, braised fish . . .The Jiang family had not eaten meat for a long time. Looking at all these, old lady Jiang could not move her eyes away.She wanted to sit at one of the tables; she was Jiang Zhen\u2019s mother, who could stop her? Maybe she could even bring some food back to little Yuanwen. Old lady Jiang was about to enter when she suddenly saw about twenty people from a distance coming here.These people were men and women, young and old, and most of the people in Hexi Village couldn\u2019t recognize them. But there was one person who they knew, Liu Heitou, who came to Hexi a few days ago to kidnap people.Check also my another new novel \u2013 Spare Tire is GoneThe rich second generation Qi Cong was robbed of his body by an unknown traveler at the age of 21, and his consciousness sank into a series of bizarre dreams.Three years later, Qi Cong woke up to find that his family was bankrupt, his studies were abandoned and even his loyal dog boyfriend had left the country.

Later, there was no sign of Liu Heitou, and he didn\u2019t show up to make trouble, so everyone was relieved. Nobody expected to see Liu Heitou at this moment.Liu Heitou came to Jiang Zhen\u2019s door when he was getting married. Was he looking for trouble? Who were these people around him?The people of Hexi got scared. Liu Heitou looked at these people with pity, and the corners of his mouth curled up slightly. He did come to make trouble for Jiang Zhen. It was a great shame for him to be beaten up by Jiang Zhen that day, and he was never a man who let go of his grudges, so he naturally thought about taking revenge on Jiang Zhen. But at that time, he had some scruples.When Jiang Zhen beat him up that day, he saw the goods that Jiang Zhen put aside. There were many good things among those goods that he couldn\u2019t buy in the county town even if he wanted . . .Jiang Zhen was brave enough to fight him, and he was good at martial arts and could get a hold of so many good things. There was definitely something going on . . . Under such circumstances, Liu Heitou naturally did not dare to lay hands on Jiang Zhen hastily. For days, he investigated Jiang Zhen\u2019s affairs. In the past few days, it took a lot of effort to find something about the other person, and he needed to ask people one by one. However, Jiang Zhen was a native of Hexi. Apart from going out twice in the recent months, he had never left the area before. Liu Heitou soon learned about his ventures. Although he didn\u2019t know where he had gone on those two trips, there was no doubt that Jiang Zhen had no background for him to be afraid of.At this time, Liu Heitou also thought of the words he had spoken when he was unable to kidnap He Qiusheng, saying that he still wanted to collect the debt from the He family. Back then, he said that to save face and also because he wanted to test Jiang Zhen. And it turned out . . . Jiang Zhen really didn\u2019t have much of a background. Otherwise, how could he have saved the ger and still let him continue asking for the repayment of the debt? He must have known that the He family were by no means able to pay it back.Acting that way, it seemed like Liu Heitou didn\u2019t pay attention to Jiang Zhen. Jiang Zhen\u2019s skills were very good, and it looked like he had seen a bit of blood . . . so Liu Heitou did not dare to target him rashly. However, he had plenty of ways to deal with him. This Jiang Zhen was about to get married, and the mother of the ger he was going to marry was from their Lijia Village.Within Lijia, Liu Heitou could cover the sky with one hand. He didn\u2019t harm people from his village for no reason, so the people in Lijia listened to him. And so, he could call Zhao Liu\u2019s family to come and go along with him.Jiang Zhen led Zhao Jinge into the new house. Zhao Liu also went in, but Zhao Fugui was greeting guests outside. Seeing these people, Zhao Fugui\u2019s face immediately changed. \u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201dZhao Fugui extremely disliked Zhao Liu\u2019s family because these people had never been kind to Zhao Liu. Zhao Liu was the eldest daughter of the family and had two younger brothers and one younger sister.Lijia villagers thought their daughters would marry out sooner or later, so they were just really helping their future partners raise them. Generally speaking, they were not very kind to their daughters, but Zhao Liu\u2019s parents were especially bad to her. Although the degree of mistreatment was not as bad as that of old lady Jiang to Eldest Jiang, still, they scolded and beat Zhao Liu up. It was just that many women in the countryside led such a life that Zhao Liu didn\u2019t think this was wrong.In the blink of an eye, Zhao Liu was old enough to get married. At that time, her parents told her about her marriage and wanted to marry her off to a bachelor in his late thirties. Of course, there was a reason why this old bachelor couldn\u2019t get a wife even in his thirties, and that was because he was very poor. His family only owned 2 mu of dryland that couldn\u2019t grow anything, so no one wanted to marry him because of his poverty. However, he didn\u2019t go hungry; he went to work for a big family in the county town as a servant. After working like this for more than ten years, he was able to save fifty to sixty silver.This old bachelor had been thinking about having a wife for more than twenty years. So when he finally had the money, he didn\u2019t want to buy land but wanted to buy himself a wife. With his situation, anyone who cared about their daughter was unwilling to marry her to him. But some people only looked at the bride price. Zhao Liu\u2019s parents planned to sell her for fifty silver, and the men haggled it down to 40 silver.At that time, Zhao Liu was only fifteen or sixteen years old, and naturally, she didn\u2019t want to marry a man who could be her father, but her parents didn\u2019t listen to her at all. Fortunately, Zhao Fugui soon appeared.Zhao Fugui was the Zhao family\u2019s only son. Although the Liu family asked for many gifts, the Zhao family borrowed some money from others and prepared forty silver.Zhao Liu\u2019s parents did not want to be accused of being harsh to their daughter, so they finally agreed to marry Zhao Liu to Zhao Fugui but only after accepting the bride price. When Zhao Liu got married, she didn\u2019t even receive a quilt from them. The new clothes were sent by Zhao Fugui, but even these were robbed and sold by them. Zhao Liu came to the Zhao family in her old clothes.Zhao Liu\u2019s parents went a little too far away, and Zhao Liu was a bit angry in her heart. But they were still her parents, so she didn\u2019t completely cut off contact. Later, Zhao Liu\u2019s life was very good and Zhao Fugui was good to her. She let go of her resentment and got along better with her family.At some point, Zhao Liu\u2019s second younger brother wanted to marry, and her parents wanted to borrow twenty silver from her. Zhao Liu was unwilling, but her parents kept pestering, cursing, and swearing that they would pay it back in the future. After discussing it with Zhao Fugui, Zhao Liu lent them ten silver. But as it turned out, the Liu family never paid it back, but that was nothing. The relationship between the two families got worse and worse, and at that time, something happened to the Zhao family.After Zhao Liu\u2019s eldest son, Zhao Jinhu, drowned, Zhao Liu jumped into the river to look for him. She searched madly for two hours before Zhao Jinhu was found. By that time, Zhao Jinhu had long ceased breathing. Zhao Fugui also jumped in the water to search for him. Learning that his son was dead, he was tired and sad and didn\u2019t pay attention to Zhao Liu\u2019s health.Zhao Jinhu was unmarried and was still a child, so his funeral was very simple. After Zhao Fugui finished it, he discovered that Zhao Liu was burning up and nobody knew for how long.After Zhao Jinhu\u2019s accident, Zhao Liu\u2019s family didn\u2019t come to see them even once. When Zhao Liu fell ill and Zhao Fugui needed money to let her see a doctor, they unexpectedly refused to return the money and even drove Zhao Fugui out.Zhao Liu\u2019s illness was very dangerous. She coughed incessantly and even coughed up some blood. After that, she stayed in bed for nearly a year, and the life of the Zhao family got worse and worse. During that period, Zhao Liu\u2019s family never appeared in front of them.After Zhao Liu recovered from her illness, she was still in poor health. From then on, she never went to visit her family\u2019s house again. However, she asked Zhao Jinge to deliver some homegrown dishes every year for the Spring Festival. She was doing it for the others to see and also to embarrass the Liu family.The least valuable thing in the countryside were vegetables from the field. The daughter who married out, lived so badly that she could only send her own vegetables for the Spring Festival . . . She was so pitiful, yet the Liu family still refused to pay their debt . . .It had to be said that Zhao Liu doing this had made the Liu family lose a lot of face, but it was a pity that the Liu family were shameless and didn\u2019t care much.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Liu Dacheng, the eldest brother of the Liu family, smiled and said, \u201cBrother-in-law, aren\u2019t we here for the wedding?\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t invite you,\u201d Zhao Fugui said angrily.\u201cThat is your mistake. Jinge is getting married. How could you not invite his uncle? According to tradition, when he marries, we need to carry him!\u201dLiu Dacheng went to the tables that had already been set up by the Zhao family, pushed aside a guest, and sat down on the edge of the table. \u201cAs uncles and aunts that have the closest relationship, you have to give me a big red envelope.\u201dAccording to rural customs, if the bride had a brother when she got married, this brother needed to carry her out. If there were no brothers in the family, someone from her maternal family\u2019s side would do it, like the uncle or cousin, and the bride\u2019s family would give them a red envelope.But . . . it was customary for a married niece to give a big red envelope. Even when an uncle gave a red packet of 100 copper to his nephew, the nephew or niece only needed to give him 50 copper. Not only that, the uncle from the mother\u2019s side was supposed to help in the wedding preparations!In the end of the day, this so-called red envelope was only because some people thought it was too much to ask for both money and help, so they finally gave a small red envelope.Liu Dacheng\u2019s statement showed his extreme shamelessness, but they did even more shameless things.Liu Dacheng\u2019s wife also sat down, took the things on the table, and ate them. She also said to some men from Hexi, \u201cZhao Liu is really unfilial. Her son doesn\u2019t even say anything to his family when he gets married. She never knew how to be polite. But now she is getting more and more foolish, making her parents angry.\u201d\u201cThe Zhao family are living such a good life and could even hold such a decent wedding. At the beginning, we only borrowed ten silver from the Zhao family, and she came back and forth for it for ten years. I\u2019ve never seen such a stingy person.\u201dWhen the first person opened their mouth, more and more people from the Liu family spoke excessively, and some people even commented on Zhao Jinge.\u201cThis Jinge is so ugly. I don\u2019t know how he hooked up with a man who was willing to marry in.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with people . . . Once upon a time, there was an eunuch who was bitten by a dog in our village. As long as someone is willing to marry, no matter who it is, will you marry?\u201d\u201cYes. If not for that, who would want to marry such an ugly and old ger?\u201d. . .These people scolded without restraint, but they also kept eating the food and even took out baskets and casks and started emptying the dishes. They were so fast that the guests invited by the Zhao family could not respond.Sometimes in this world, the more shameless you were, the better you could take advantage of it.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Wang Haisheng looked at the people discontentedly and stood up. He used to be a very timid man, but after being with Jiang Zhen for a long time, he was no longer the silent man he used to be.\u201cYes! What are you doing? Stop it!\u201d He Chunsheng also stood up, and his brother, He Xiasheng seeing this, stood up quickly as well.Although He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng had come today, they had been shrinking in the corner without any sense of presence. They knew that their identity was a little embarrassing. Seeing that the Zhao family had no need for help, they hid in a corner and didn\u2019t say anything. They just wanted to eat the wedding banquet silently and leave. And as it turned out . . . Liu Heitou came!Having been beaten by Liu Heitou several times, He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were afraid of him. When they saw Liu Heitou, they couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit weak and even wanted to turn around and run away. But if they ran away this time . . . wouldn\u2019t all their previous efforts be useless? Their days might be even more miserable in the future.He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were trying hard to not run away when they saw Wang Haisheng stand up. Even though they felt embarrassed, they also stood up.\u201cLooks like people are still daring to talk to us like that. After my sister married into the Zhao family, she turned a blind eye to us, didn\u2019t she?\u201d Liu Dacheng said angrily and overturned a table.The dishes on that table had already been eaten or emptied by them, but the plates that were still there were all smashed to pieces.Liu Dacheng was called by Liu Heitou to make trouble for Zhao Fugui and his family. When his eldest daughter came back from the county town a few days ago and told them that Zhao Jinge might be getting married, their family didn\u2019t care\u2014they didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with the Zhao family because the life of the Zhao family was difficult. But what they didn\u2019t expect was that, even though they didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with the Zhao family, Liu Heitou from their village unexpectedly came to their door . . . Naturally, they didn\u2019t dare to not listen to Liu Heitou\u2019s words, so they came here to make trouble. And after seeing that the Zhao family\u2019s marriage banquet was so respectable, they were even more eager to find fault.The sound of the bowls and chopsticks falling to pieces on the ground was so loud that Zhao Fugui clenched his fist in resentment. Just then, Jiang Zhen strode out of the house.Today was his wedding day. Although Jiang Zhen had long regarded Zhao Jinge as someone from his family, he knew how much he cared about these customs. He didn\u2019t regard the wedding as sacred but still calmly completed the process. After all, this was his wedding, a once in a lifetime wedding.He took Zhao Jinge into their new house, and their mother was saying auspicious words. But before he could lift Zhao Jinge\u2019s red veil, there was a loud noise outside. He finished the process at the highest speed, lifting Zhao Jinge\u2019s red veil and drinking a glass of wine. He couldn\u2019t believe that someone dared to overturn his table!Jiang Zhen himself had overturned the table of the Jiang family once, but no one was allowed to overturn his own table! What was more, this was his wedding!Zhao Jinge had looked forward to this wedding so much that he had been trembling in delight, but someone wanted to destroy it . . ..\u201cLooking for trouble?\u201d Jiang Zhen scanned the people present, and finally, his eyes fell on Liu Heitou.\u201cI heard that you changed your name to Jiang Zhen? Jiang Zhen, your mother-in-law . . . Oh, you married in! Then it is your mother, your mother is from Lijia Village, so we as your relatives have come here to drink the wedding wine.\u201dLiu Heitou looked at Jiang Zhen with a sneer on his face. In fact, he could have come to make trouble earlier, so that Jiang Zhen could not even pay his respects in the ancestral hall, but he didn\u2019t do that. If Jiang Zhen wanted to marry the ugly ger or go to live in the ugly ger\u2019s house, why should he stop him? He couldn\u2019t wait!Liu Heitou looked at Jiang Zhen with disdain in his eyes. Up until now, he had completely ignored Jiang Zhen and wanted to see the mess he caused Jiang Zhen. The Liu family were his relatives. When relatives came to his door, what could he do?\u201cJiang Zhen!\u201d Zhao Jinge came out of the house with his eyebrows wrinkled tightly, so the scar between his eyebrows stood out even more.Liu Heitou glanced at Zhao Jinge and said with a sneer, \u201cIs this the man you married? He is really ugly. He can\u2019t compare with the little ger you saved last time. However, there are still uses for a big man like him. You don\u2019t have to be afraid of breaking him.\u201dAs Liu Heitou spoke, Jiang Zhen had already started taking off his new clothes. He threw his clothes at Zhao Jinge and let him take them. Jiang Zhen grabbed the door bolt and went out.If a bad guest came to your door, it was better to fight them out!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 78": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 58.1 - When the fighting continuesPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58.1 \u2013 When the fighting continuesJiang Zhen\u2019s starting speed was very fast, and he hardly gave people time to respond. And the first person he dealt with was Liu Dacheng.Since Zhao Liu regarded Jiang Zhen as one of her own, she would naturally talk to him about everything, so she told Jiang Zhen about herself and her family. Eldest Jiang\u2019s memories combined with Zhao Liu\u2019s, and from what he could see of the current situation, he could naturally guess the identity of the Liu family.To such a person, Jiang Zhen did not feel the need to be polite at all. He waved the door bolt and hit Liu Dacheng on the leg, which immediately knocked Liu Dacheng down. The man, who bragged that the Zhao family couldn\u2019t do anything to him before, screamed in disbelief at this moment.Liu Dacheng didn\u2019t know of Jiang Zhen\u2019s \u201cfame\u201d in Hexi. When he promised Liu Heitou to make trouble, he didn\u2019t think he would himself be in trouble if he made trouble. As for the possibility of being beaten . . . this was even more unexpected for him.The Zhao family was having a wedding today! Even if someone were to make trouble, they should only bear it on such a day . . . What was more, he was Zhao Liu\u2019s brother after all. Even if Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu hated him, with this kind of close kinship, they couldn\u2019t really do anything to him.Liu Dacheng always thought that when he came to the Zhaos\u2019 house today, he could just eat, drink, and even get something he could take home. If Liu Heitou was satisfied with what he did, his son might even be able to work for Liu Heitou. However, he guessed only the beginning but not the ending.He did get to eat and drink at the Zhaos\u2019 house, but he was beaten just after eating something.When Jiang Zhen came out, the Liu family was still saying all kinds of bad things about him and Zhao Jinge, and the loudest one was Liu Dacheng\u2019s wife. Beside her, there was also the woman who made fun of Zhao Jinge when he went with Jiang Zhen to buy meat in the county town last time.Jiang Zhen sneered, and after knocking down Liu Dacheng, he kicked Liu Dacheng\u2019s wife on her chest. Her mouth was stuffed full with meat. Jiang Zhen then kicked another man in the stomach, and the man covered his stomach with a cry and immediately vomited.\u201cGo and get him!\u201d Liu Heitou was also surprised to see Jiang Zhen\u2019s sudden attack.Today was his wedding day, he didn\u2019t expect that he wouldn\u2019t care about that and would start hitting people! Besides, was he really not afraid of offending him?Liu Heitou looked at Jiang Zhen angrily, but soon, there was a glimmer of pride in his eyes.The last time he went to take He Qiusheng, he only took a few of his cousins with him. None of them were good at fighting and were caught off guard, so they were defeated by Jiang Zhen. But this time . . . Liu Heitou came prepared this time, and he really didn\u2019t think he would lose!After Liu Heitou gave the signal, two experienced goons rushed towards Jiang Zhen. The difference between Liu Dacheng and these two thugs was like the difference between heaven and earth. Jiang Zhen really couldn\u2019t take care of them at the moment. He waved the door bolt to keep them away and shouted at Wang Haisheng and He Chunsheng, \u201cAre you stupid? You don\u2019t know how to help?\u201dWang Haisheng was already looking for a weapon. He grabbed a bamboo pole from the Zhao family\u2019s backyard and rushed to help Jiang Zhen. He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were in a daze.When they were younger, they fought with other kids while playing, buy now . . .\u201cGo!\u201d He Chunsheng gritted his teeth and took a bamboo pole from behind the door.No matter what He Xiasheng thought, he always listened to his older brother. Seeing his brother doing it, he also grabbed a bamboo pole and rushed out. It was just that the two of them didn\u2019t know who to hit.He Chunsheng glanced around, and his eyes fell on Liu Heitou. This was the man who came to their house last time and beat them and even tried to kidnap their younger brother. This was the man . . .In the past two days, Jiang Zhen only asked He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng to help them with his work and didn\u2019t teach them anything, but when he instructed Wang Haisheng how to exercise and fight, he didn\u2019t deliberately hide it from them, so they saw how Wang Haisheng exercised every day.Wang Haisheng was holding a bamboo pole every day and then rushing forward without much skill, they . . . In fact, it could be done. Holding the bamboo pole, He Chunsheng rushed directly towards Liu Heitou. \u201cDie!\u201dLiu Heitou snorted coldly and was about to grab the bamboo pole from He Chunsheng\u2019s hand.However, before he could snatch the bamboo pole from his hand, He Xiasheng, who was following his brother did the same thing. They hit Liu Heitou hard on the waist!Liu Heitou groaned and staggered while He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were stunned. They had no idea that they could hurt Liu Heitou.This time, in addition to the Liu family, Liu Heitou had brought six people along. Two of them had already reached Jiang Zhen to hit him while the other four were standing around. After He Xiasheng hit Liu Heitou, the four people rushed towards He Chunsheng and knocked him down with one punch.A few days ago, He Xiasheng was also knocked down like this. At that time, he had never been hit like that, so he got confused and only knew how to protect his head with his arms, but this time was different. He Xiasheng, who had already been beaten once, was not as scared as he was last time. He jumped up, rushed at the person who hit him, grabbed the other person\u2019s arm, and bit him.He Chunsheng was also hit this time, but he did the same thing as He Xiasheng and resisted. Each of them was entangled with a goon, and they were about to start fighting again. Wang Haisheng shouted and rushed out, directly knocking down one goon with the bamboo pole!At the same time, Zhao Fugui also moved. He knew that his physical strength was not good, so he wouldn\u2019t be able to overpower Liu Heitou and his thugs. Instead, he used his broom to greet Liu Dacheng, who hadn\u2019t gotten up yet.\u201cYou bastard! I let you start making trouble!\u201dWhen his eldest son died, this man said that it was just unlucky for him to die. He didn\u2019t even attend the funeral and would not pay back the money to his elder sister for medical treatment. Now that his Jinge was finally getting married, he even came to make trouble! Zhao Fugui simply hated Liu Dacheng.This time, Liu Dacheng was not the only one who came from the Liu family, there was also Liu Ermao, Zhao Liu\u2019s other younger brother, as well as the children of the Liu brothers. Most of the women and children of these people had run away by then, but most of the Men were basically still there. When Zhao Fugui went to beat Liu Dacheng, someone immediately came up to stop him.Liu Ermao was strong, so he was able to drag Zhao Fugui away. Unexpectedly, Zhao Liu took a burning firewood from the kitchen and burned him, which forced him to let go of Zhao Fugui.Liu Ermao was angry and wanted to stop Zhao Liu but was stopped by Zhao Jinge who had also finished taking off his new clothes. Although Zhao Jinge was a ger, he was not inferior to an adult man in terms of strength. At this time, he was still very angry, so when he fought with Liu Ermao, he had the upper hand during the whole fight.That was how the chaos began.The ordinary villagers who came to see the wedding scene in Hexi had long run away, as well as most of the guests invited by Zhao Fugui. Only Jiang Ping, who thought that, as the village head, he needed to stay and observe the situation. He stayed with his son. But he also hid in the house\u2014Here, if the situation gets worse, I can always close the door.Of course, Jiang Ping was ready to run away at any time, but his son had his own idea, which was the complete opposite.Looking at the fight outside, Jiang Ping\u2019s son was so excited that a stream of blood rose from his chest. He grew up with He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng, so they had some friendship. Seeing that the people from Hexi were at a disadvantage, he quietly left his father\u2019s side and caught Liu Dacheng\u2019s eldest son in a fight.\u201cAy . . .\u201d Jiang Ping wanted to stop his son, but it was too late. He clenched his teeth and finally grabbed a piece of firewood chopped by Jiang Zhen and threw it.This village head Jiang had no other skills, but his accuracy at throwing things was excellent. In the past, if he wanted to throw something at his eldest son, he would never hit his second son. So now if he wanted to aim at someone from Qiaotou Village, he would not hit people from Hexi Village.Meanwhile, Jiang Zhen had already thrown away the door bolt.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Such weapons were too bulky and exhausting.Liu Heitou didn\u2019t want to kill anyone. The people he brought didn\u2019t use knives, and Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t use any sharp weapon either. The two sides fought each other with bare hands.These people were very good at fighting, and it was very difficult to find someone\u2019s weakness. However . . . Jiang Zhen was a man who was very good at finding other people\u2019s weaknesses.When Jiang Zhen kicked three inches below the navel, one of the people who fought against him suddenly fell to the ground. He couldn\u2019t even scream. After taking care of one, it was easy to Deal with the other . . .\u201cJiang Zhen, how dare you!\u201d Liu Heitou looked at Jiang Zhen with a black face. He really didn\u2019t expect that this man would dare to fight against him. He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng too, these people . . . they used to be frightened by a small intimidation, but now they dared to do this!\u201cYou too,\u201d Jiang Zhen said in a slow breath and went straight for Liu Heitou.\u201cJiang Zhen, you are not afraid . . .\u201d Liu Heitou wanted to have a good talk with Jiang Zhen. He believed that if Jiang Zhen knew the consequences of offending him, he would be subdued, but . . . Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t want to talk with him at all.Jiang Zhen knew very well that once he became soft, it would be difficult to gain respect later. And he wanted to be respected.Liu Heitou was born in the countryside, so he certainly didn\u2019t have a great background. He probably depended on someone else; he would have to check it later. Now, he needed to teach these people a lesson first.People like Liu Heitou, when they saw others give in, would definitely take advantage. But if they were frightened they would no longer dare to do anything.Liu Heitou brought the Liu family and six other subordinates this time. He took it for granted that he would win against Jiang Zhen, but he didn\u2019t want to fight Jiang Zhen himself in the end. What was more, he didn\u2019t expect that . . . when Jiang Zhen fought him this time, he would be much more powerful than last time! Didn\u2019t Jiang Zhen use all of his strength last time? He was a farmer who had been working in this village all his life. Why was he so good?Liu Heitou\u2019s face showed how startled he was, but Jiang Zhen used all of his skills at this very moment.The last time when he fought Liu Heitou, he had just gotten back from a long journey, so he was tired, but found out that he could deal with Liu Heitou well. Naturally, he would not use all of his skills, but this time was different. Earlier, he had been in good spirits, but now, he was very furious\u2014his own wedding had been disturbed! Under such circumstances, it was natural that he would fight fiercely.Liu Heitou couldn\u2019t resist Jiang Zhen anymore and soon clenched his teeth, taking out a dagger he planned to use in this fight. However, when Jiang Zhen sized him up at the beginning, he could already see that there was a weapon hidden on him. Therefore, when his hand moved, Jiang Zhen already had a countermeasure in place.As soon as Liu Heitou pulled out the dragger, it was snatched by Jiang Zhen. Then Jiang Zhen locked his throat with his arm and put the dagger tip right under his eyes.He Chunsheng and the others could no longer resist Liu Heitou\u2019s men. Jiang Zhen was about to be besieged, but his skills immediately reversed the situation. Liu Heitou was in his hands, who would dare to continue fighting?Liu Heitou did not expect that he would be defeated so quickly, so he froze in place. Jiang Zhen wasn\u2019t surprised with this situation. If he had not been sure, he would have never dared to do it. He would have certainly taken out the \u201cgood things\u201d he had hidden in the house.\u201cJiang Zhen, let me go!\u201d Liu Heitou shouted.The last time Liu Heitou shouted, Jiang Zhen did let him go, but this time, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t.\u201cLet you go? You make trouble when I\u2019m just getting married and expect me to let you go?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Liu Heitou frowned, but he was not afraid. He didn\u2019t believe that Jiang Zhen would do anything to him this time.\u201cI don\u2019t want anything right now, but this will not necessarily be the case in the future.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled and cut Liu Heitou\u2019s face with the dagger. The sharp dagger cut through the skin, and blood came out.Liu Heitou shivered and felt very cold for some reason. This Jiang Zhen has definitely killed people! Liu Heitou suddenly regretted it. When he first clashed with Jiang Zhen, he already knew that Jiang Zhen was not easy to mess with. In this case, why had he come to provoke Jiang Zhen again?\u201cI\u2019m in a bad mood right now. Do you think maybe I should do something?\u201d Jiang Zhen turned his wrist and peeled off a layer of skin off Liu Heitou\u2019s face.People who had been injured knew that it didn\u2019t necessarily hurt much to have a deep cut, but it was very painful when a layer of skin was peeled off.At the moment, Liu Heitou was in terrible pain, but he was different from the people Jiang Zhen had dealt with before. He didn\u2019t cry out from the pain.\u201cThis is . . . What\u2019s the matter?\u201d a hesitant voice sounded.Jiang Zhen glanced up and saw Yang Jing standing not far away with a tangled look on his face. Beside him was the shopkeeper of the porcelain shop.Jiang Zhen was getting married and had invited Yang Jing, but Yang Jing didn\u2019t want to come early . . . He had lost face in Hexi before; if he had come here earlier, wouldn\u2019t he be a joke? Yang Jing thought that for his own sake he should give Jiang Zhen a gift when he got married, but it would be better to come late so no one would see him . . . As for his wife and children, in order to avoid learning that he had not been very brave in the past, it was better not to bring them here. So he went out very late in the morning, and when he got at the dock, trying to find a boat going to Hexi, he unexpectedly met the owner of the porcelain shop, who was also going to meet Jiang Zhen in Hexi.Well, Yang Jing didn\u2019t know what was going on. Jiang Zhen was obviously in the seafood business two months ago, but since then, he was able to get porcelain that even the porcelain shop owner valued highly! He seemed to have made a lot of money . . . He hasn\u2019t become a water bandit and robbed someone, has he?Yang Jing thought a lot, but did not know that he really guessed a part of it right . . . Jiang Zhen really did rob someone\u2014he robbed the water bandits. Yang Jing sighed in secret and came to Hexi Village with the shopkeeper of the porcelain shop. Knowing that this day was Jiang Zhen\u2019s wedding day, the owner of the porcelain shop also said that he would like to ask for some wedding candy to eat. But it turned out . . . How could this messy place be a wedding?Yang Jing looked at the way Jiang Zhen held Liu Heitou\u2019s head, inexplicably feeling his face hurt a bit. Back then, Jiang Zhen cut his face with a knife too!\u201cMaster Yang! It\u2019s Master Yang! Master Yang, I\u2019m Little Hei!\u201d Liu Heitou shouted at Yang Jing with a smile on his face.He and Yang Jing knew each other, and wasn\u2019t this Yang Jing also the yamen officer who was offended by Jiang Zhen before? Yang Jing was here; he would save him!Yang Jing did know Liu Heitou; he liked gambling and often hung around in gambling shops in the countryside. Liu Heitou was one of the top thugs raised by a gambling shop. The gambling shop had some background, so Yang Jing didn\u2019t dare to start a conflict in the gambling shop, but Liu Heitou was just one of the gambling house\u2019s thugs; he didn\u2019t care about him.\u201cLittle Hei . . . what\u2019s going on?\u201d Yang Jing asked, sympathizing with Liu Heitou. Was this the same Liu Heitou he encountered before?What\u2019s going on? Can\u2019t Yang Jing see it? Liu Heitou was shocked when he heard Yang Jing\u2019s question. This time, he found that Yang Jing was looking at Jiang Zhen with fear. This . . . Liu Heitou suddenly realized that Yang Jing would not stand up for him. And . . . Yang Jing was even carrying a gift in his hands . . . He was afraid that Yang Jing came here to give a congratulatory gift to Jiang Zhen!After Jiang Zhen beat the yamen officer up, he was still able to ask the yamen officer to give him a gift? What is going on?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But Liu Heitou was afraid that this guy, who didn\u2019t care about playing cards according to common sense, would suddenly hurt him. He could only say to Yang Jing, \u201cMisunderstanding. There is a bit of a misunderstanding between us, Master Yang. A misunderstanding.\u201dDamn it! Jiang Zhen is crazy! After he heard what the people in Hexi Village said about him, why didn\u2019t he take it to heart? Not to mention that, no matter how upset he was, Jiang Zhen refused to back off and let him go. He only hoped that Yang Jing could make Jiang Zhen release him.\u201cHe said . . . it was a misunderstanding,\u201d Yang Jing said to Jiang Zhen, hoping Jiang Zhen would release Liu Heitou.Despite the fact that Liu Heitou called him Master Yang and called himself Little Hei, it was mainly because he feared people from the government. Except for some exotic birds like Jiang Zhen, most people were afraid of the government. However, Liu Heitou was very respectful towards Yang Jing, and Yang Jing didn\u2019t dare to offend Liu Heitou.There was a high-ranking official in their county town; he was a second rank senior official in the imperial court, and it was his troublemaker of a brother who owned the gambling shop. The person behind the gambling shop was a county magistrate who no one dared to offend and had to be flattered befittingly. What was a yamen officer like Yang Jing worth? He never dared to argue when he lost money there.Although Liu Heitou was only a thug, he was highly valued by the manager of the gambling house. Yang Jing didn\u2019t want to start a conflict with him.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t speak but gave a slight sign to Yang Jing in a place Liu Heitou couldn\u2019t see.Yang Jing was slightly stunned when he saw this, and once again advised Jiang Zhen, \u201cJiang Zhen, I know Liu Heitou. Since I\u2019m his acquaintance, let him go first, and we can discuss it.\u201d\u201cI will let him go, but there is nothing to discuss. Leave!\u201d Jiang Zhen seemed to give Yang Jing some face and finally let go of Liu Heitou.Liu Heitou looked at Jiang Zhen bitterly and left without looking back. He had lost face this time! Even though Liu Heitou didn\u2019t care about losing face as much as Yang Jing, it was hard to accept being treated this way. Liu Heitou took his men and left quickly.Jiang Zhen felt that Liu Heitou had malicious intentions towards him, frowned slightly, but was still not particularly afraid.Obviously Liu Heitou was a thug, and thugs were never irreplaceable. Some people needed thugs to help them, but they wouldn\u2019t help them in return.Jiang Zhen actually had something to ask Yang Jing, but at that moment, he had to deal with the Liu family first.Seeing that Liu Heitou was knocked down and ran away, the Liu family were already scared. It was just that they were previously caught by Zhao Fugui, Zhao Jinge, and the others and fought, so they were all more or less injured, and were now unable to run away.Jiang Zhen still had the bloody knife snatched from Liu Heitou in his hand, which looked terrible.Liu Dacheng looked at him, clutching his mouth where two teeth had been knocked out and was bleeding. He said, \u201cMisunderstanding, it\u2019s all a misunderstanding . . . We have come here for the wedding.\u201d\u201cYes, we\u2019re all here for the wedding,\u201d Liu Ermao said too.\u201cYou came here for the wedding? Where is your gift money?\u201d Jiang Zhen raised his eyebrows and asked, playing with the dagger in his hand.The Liu family came here to make trouble today, bringing baskets and wooden buckets, which they planned to use to take things away from the Zhao family, but they didn\u2019t bring any money.\u201cWe forgot to bring it. We\u2019ll make up for it next time, next time,\u201d Liu Dacheng hurriedly said. When he spoke, his mouth was not only windy, but also so painful that he was about to burst into tears.\u201cReally?\u201d Jiang Zhen raised his eyebrows and asked.\u201cJiang Zhen, don\u2019t believe them. These people\u2019s words are just like farts,\u201d Zhao Fugui said indignantly.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, Dad. You can ask them to write a debt note.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled.\u201cDebt note?\u201d Zhao Fugui was slightly shocked. Most of them in the countryside didn\u2019t know how to write or read. Even if they borrowed money, they wouldn\u2019t write any debt notes. At most, when the sum was relatively large, they would find several people as witnesses. For example, in their village, they would usually go to Jiang Ping, the village head, and ask him to act as a witness.\u201cIt will be a debt note,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. Then he looked at Wang Haisheng and said, \u201cGo and bring me the pen, ink, paper and ink stone I bought last time.\u201dWang Haisheng nodded and immediately went to Jiang Zhen\u2019s house to take the ink, brush, paper and ink stone that Jiang Zhen had bought when they went to Fucheng.When Jiang Zhen found that he didn\u2019t know many traditional Chinese characters, he decided to study hard and bought a set of the cheapest pen, ink, paper and ink stone. As for why he could only ruthlessly buy the cheapest set . . . ink, paper and ink stone were too expensive in this era. That set of brush, ink, paper, and ink stone had never been used by Jiang Zhen and was still brand new.Taking these things from Wang Haisheng\u2019s hand, Jiang Zhen went in the house and said to Wang Haisheng, \u201cTie up the Liu family.\u201dAs soon as Jiang Zhen spoke, Wang Haisheng immediately moved his hands. He Chunsheng, He Xiasheng, and Jiang Ming, Jiang Ping\u2019s son, who had just helped them fight, also went to help.Jiang Ping, the village head of Hexi Village, had two sons. The elder son, Jiang Quan, helped him supervise the construction of the new house when Jiang Zhen asked the Jiang family for a house. He was married and had a very stable personality; he was recognized as Jiang Ping\u2019s successor by the villagers. Jiang Ming, the second son . . . seeing that his nose was now dark and blue and his face was swollen yet he was still excited, it was obvious that his temperament was totally different from his father\u2019s and his brother\u2019s. Of course, this was also because he was young. The sixteen-year-old Jiang Ming was full of energy and had nowhere to vent it. It was not surprising that he liked to fight.\u201cThis rope can\u2019t be tied like this . . .\u201d Yang Jing pointed out to several people nearby. He didn\u2019t dare to offend Liu Heitou, but he didn\u2019t care about the Liu family. As for tying people up with ropes . . . although his technique of binding people was not as good as that of Jiang Zhen, he had specially learned it!By the time Jiang Zhen had finished grinding the ink and laid the paper to write, Liu Dacheng and his eldest son had already been tied up. The others were either children or women, so they didn\u2019t bother to tie them up.After a glance at Liu Dacheng, Jiang Zhen said, \u201cI won\u2019t overcharge you with the gift money. Ten silver is enough. Also, ten silver as compensation for breaking things in my family\u2019s house. In the past, you also borrowed ten silver from my family . . .\u201dWho would give ten silver as a gift? What was more, the damaged things, the food, and the drinks they had, would all add up to two silver at most. But Jiang Zhen asked them to pay ten silver as a compensation?Liu Dacheng was full of resentment, but he didn\u2019t dare to refute. Thirty was thirty. He could always drag it on. If he really couldn\u2019t, he would let his parents pay. Zhao Liu couldn\u2019t force her elderly parents to pay back the money.Liu Dacheng had long been used to avoiding his debts. He was thinking like this, when he heard Jiang Zhen say again, \u201cIt all adds up to one hundred silver. I\u2019ll write a debt note, and you can just press your fingerprint.\u201d\u201cOne hundred silver?\u201d Liu Dacheng looked at Jiang Zhen in disbelief. How could he owe a hundred silver? It was one hundred silver!\u201cOf course, it is 120. How much did you think it was?\u201d Jiang Zhen sneered.\u201cWe only borrowed ten silver . . .\u201d Plus today\u2019s twenty, shouldn\u2019t it be thirty?\u201cThe remaining seventy are interest,\u201d said Jiang Zhen with a frown. \u201cHowever, I seem to have calculated too little interest for you. When Liu Heitou lent others money, it would double in a month. I can\u2019t be any worse than him . . .\u201d\u201cIt is good. It is good,\u201d Liu Dacheng hurriedly said. If they doubled the amount of money every month, like Jiang Zhen said, after the fifteen or sixteen years since he borrowed them . . .\u201cAs long as you think it\u2019s enough,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, writing the debt note directly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although Jiang Zhen often changed it into a Chinese homework class and didn\u2019t practice any calligraphy at all, he could at least write a word with a brush, and his skills were quite standard.\u201cToday, Liu Dacheng and Liu Ermao owe Zhao Jinge one hundred silver,\u201d Jiang Zhen read and wrote at the same time, and soon, he finished a decent looking line of writing.These words were very simple, like \u201cZhao\u201d. Because it was Zhao Jinge\u2019s surname, he specially used branches to write it several times in a row on the ground, so naturally, there was no mistake. At first glance, he was almost like a scholar.After the fight, Zhao Jinge felt that it was not good for him to wear only undergarments. No matter how hot it was, he put on his new clothes again.When he finished dressing and tidying himself up, he came out of his new house. Jiang Zhen had already spread out his brush and paper to calculate the silver that the Liu family owed him. Hearing that Jiang Zhen made the Liu family pay back one hundred silver, made Zhao Jinge delighted. Then he saw Jiang Zhen could write.Jiang Zhen can write! Jiang Zhen can read!Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen in shock and was unable to recover from it. After being in contact with Jiang Zhen for a long time, he felt that Jiang Zhen was very powerful, but he didn\u2019t expect that he was even more powerful than he had thought.Jiang Zhen even knows how to read!Zhao Jinge, who didn\u2019t know a single character, suddenly felt some inferiority complex again\u2014compared to Jiang Zhen, he was really nothing special.As for why Jiang Zhen could read . . . Zhao Jinge soon found a reason for him. The Jiang family\u2019s second son and third son had both gone to school. He assumed that Jiang Zhen had watched them and learned something. Jiang Zhen was really powerful. At that time, if his family had let him go to school, he might have even been able to take the examination to become a scholar!Zhao Jinge believed in Jiang Zhen inexplicably and felt that Jiang Zhen had the ability to become a scholar, and other people felt the same way too. Jiang Zhen could read and write . . . It had a big impact on them.Even though Hexi was quite rich, the number of literates could be counted on two hands! Even Jiang Ping, the head of the village, barely knew a few words.Zhao Liu was very excited and even more satisfied with her son-in-law. Her Jinge was so amazing that he could find such a good son-in-law!\u201cCome on. Stamp it!\u201d Jiang Zhen put the debt note in front of the He brothers and said to Wang Haisheng, \u201cHold their hands and let them press their fingerprints.\u201dWang Haisheng and He Chunsheng immediately got to work. At the same time, Jiang Zhen said, \u201cLiu Dacheng, Liu Ermao, right? You\u2019d better pay the money back quickly. Otherwise . . . I\u2019m going to take this debt note to the yamen to sue you. It\u2019s not good to owe money.\u201dYang Jing: \u201c. . .\u201d You forced people to write a debt note in front of me, and you still want to complain to the yamen?\u201cIf I tell the people in the yamen that I only need fifty silver out of these hundred silver, they would certainly be happy to ask for your debt,\u201d Jiang Zhen added.Yang Jing said, \u201cOf course!\u201dWhen Liu Dacheng and Liu Ermao heard Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, they felt like crying. When they didn\u2019t have any money, how could they get a hundred silver? Of course, if they were to sell their land, it would be enough, but how could ordinary people be willing to sell land?\u201cAlright. Throw them out,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. In fact, what he just said had the same intent as that debt note, and that was, from the one hundred silver demanded, he only wanted fifty. So should the Liu family come to pay back the money obediently, he wouldn\u2019t really force them to give him all one hundred silver.After the Liu family left, Wang Haisheng and the others started cleaning up the house, and Jiang Zhen talked with the shopkeeper of the porcelain shop.The shopkeeper of the porcelain shop had negotiated a good price with the samples given by Jiang Zhen. In Jiang Zhen\u2019s house, he wanted to quote a bit lower price and get more money himself, but now . . . thinking of Jiang Zhen\u2019s ferocious appearance just now, the shopkeeper of the porcelain shop immediately rejected that thought.Jiang Zhen was involved, and since he was so ferocious, it would be better not to offend him.The shopkeeper of the porcelain shop reported the price he had negotiated, not daring to conceal it. After hearing the price, Jiang Zhen was extremely satisfied. The price was much higher than he expected!After making an appointment with the shopkeeper to deliver the goods to the county town the next day, Jiang Zhen invited the shopkeeper to stay for the wedding reception.\u201cNo, I have work to do. I need to go back,\u201d the shopkeeper of the porcelain shop hurriedly said. He was a little afraid of Jiang Zhen from that moment on . . . Besides, was there any wedding wine left to drink in such a mess?When Jiang Zhen heard his refusal, he didn\u2019t try persuading him and sent him out. The cook they had hired had already ran away, so Zhao Liu went to the kitchen to prepare some food herself.Meanwhile, Jiang Zhen took Yang Jing to his former house, and asked, \u201cWhat is Liu Heitou\u2019s background?\u201d\u201cLiu Heitou is a thug of the gambling house in the county town,\u201d Yang Jing directly reported everything he knew, and added, \u201cThat gambling shop is not easy to mess with. You . . .\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the style of the gambling house?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked suddenly.\u201cIt\u2019s not bad. If you\u2019ve already lost everything, you\u2019re not allowed to go inside again. They don\u2019t force people to sell their sons and daughters either,\u201d Yang Jing said. The people behind the gambling house still needed some reputation, because the gambling house couldn\u2019t do too much.\u201cCan you make an appointment with the manager of this gambling house for me?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked again.\u201cYes, I can . . . Why do you want to meet the man in charge?\u201d Yang Jiang asked, confused.\u201cDo you think it\u2019s better Liu Heitou to be in charge of the affairs, even though he causes a lot of trouble and has many thugs, or someone like me?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.Jiang Zhen wanted to recommend himself? In other words, Jiang Zhen was stronger than Liu Heitou. Confronted with such a choice, the steward might really not want that Liu Heitou.Liu Heitou privately lent money and gathered a group of people to gamble in Qiaotou Village. That steward must not like it. Without the gambling house in the background, Liu Heitou was nothing.Jiang Zhen gave an explanation but didn\u2019t say that he actually had other ideas. He didn\u2019t like living under others, so of course, he didn\u2019t want to be a thug, but at this moment . . . he actually remembered something.After crossing over, Jiang Zhen always felt that he had nothing to exchange for money and no useful skills, but now, he suddenly thought of something. It may not be able to earn him money, but it should make the people in the gambling house think highly of him, and that thing was . . . cards.In fact, Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know much about gambling, but even so, he knew several card games and could write down all the fifty-four cards.In modern casinos, cards were absolutely essential, but here, there was no such thing at all. Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t make money with this idea, but the goodwill gained from the gambling house would be enough . . . Without this method, Jiang Zhen might have to work as a thug to solve this crisis, but this way, it would be different. Of course, the most urgent thing was to eat enough and then go to the bridal chamber.Speaking of which, fortunately, Liu Heitou hadn\u2019t destroyed his bridal chamber; otherwise . . . he wouldn\u2019t have let him go so easily!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The guests who ran away were not expected to come back and even the short-haired cook had run away . . . Zhao Fugui had no choice but to pack up the rest of the pork he had planned to marinate and the dishes that had already been prepared but not put on the table and eat them slowly with his family. Then he went to the families he had invited for the wedding and delivered them some food. As for themselves, what they ate was the food that Zhao Liu prepared.Zhao Liu cooked braised pork and stir-fried some vegetables; she soon cleared two tables, and the rest of them ate the meal together.\u201cThat Liu Heitou may come to find trouble in the future. What are we going to do then?\u201d Jiang Ping\u2019s face showed a tangled expression.He should be very hungry after such a long time. But just thinking about the troubles they might encounter in the future, he lost his appetite.\u201cDad, what are you afraid of? If he comes, let\u2019s fight it out!\u201d Jiang Ming said cheerfully.When Jiang Zhen beat up Liu Heitou last time, he started admiring Jiang Zhen very much. Today, after everyone repelled the \u201cenemy\u201d, his gaze continued to go back to Jiang Zhen constantly with a look of worship in his eyes.Looking at his son, Jiang Ping couldn\u2019t help but feel a little frustrated.\u201cDon\u2019t worry, it\u2019s going to be alright,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.How can you say it\u2019s going to be alright? Is it going to be alright by simply saying so? Jiang Ping felt sick to the bottom of his stomach, but after looking at Jiang Zhen, he didn\u2019t know why, but he suddenly thought that this person could be trusted. In fact, Jiang Ping was not the only one who felt this way.He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were beaten again today. They were hurt, but they were very happy and full of confidence in Jiang Zhen. They had a feeling that as long as they followed Jiang Zhen they would become more and more powerful in the future, and they would no longer have to be afraid of Liu Heitou! In fact, they were no longer as afraid of Liu Heitou as they used to be.As a matter of fact, they also managed to hit Liu Heitou, didn\u2019t they?During the meal, He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng didn\u2019t dare talk too much, but after eating and leaving the Zhao family\u2019s house, He Xiasheng immediately looked at his brother excitedly. \u201cElder Brother, we beat up Liu Heitou and the men under him, didn\u2019t we?\u201d\u201cUm.\u201d He Chunsheng nodded his head. He was aching all over at the moment, but he couldn\u2019t help feeling excited when he touched his rounded belly. When he thought about what happened before, he was thrilled.Liu Heitou had always been the big rock in his heart, but now this big rock had been removed. Actually . . . Liu Heitou was not so frightening, was he?When He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were walking home, they met He Qiusheng halfway, who was waiting for them at the side of the road.\u201cBig Brother, Second Brother, you . . .\u201d When He Qiusheng saw the injuries on his two brothers, he couldn\u2019t help crying.\u201cWe\u2019re fine! Qiusheng, we beat up Liu Heitou today!\u201d He Xiasheng said excitedly to his brother.\u201cReally?\u201d He Qiusheng was surprised. He heard that Liu Heitou had gone to the Zhaos\u2019 house and knew that his two brothers had also gone there for the wedding. He had been worried all this time, and he didn\u2019t expect that his two brothers would be able to beat up Liu Heitou.\u201cOf course, it\u2019s true. I stabbed him with a bamboo pole, but it was a pity that this bamboo pole was not sharp enough and didn\u2019t stab him to death.\u201d He Xiasheng didn\u2019t speak much in front of outsiders, but in front of his younger brother, He Qiusheng, he said a lot. \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for Liu Heitou finding helpers to fight us, we wouldn\u2019t have been beaten like this.\u201dHe Qiusheng didn\u2019t believe him and looked at He Chunsheng. He Chunsheng nodded with a straight face.He Qiusheng immediately looked at his two brothers with admiration. He was always pretty, so when He Chunsheng, who was relatively stable, looked at him like this, He Chunseng couldn\u2019t help but add, \u201cYour Second Brother and I beat up Liu Heitou\u2019s subordinates, and all of them were beaten bloody by us!\u201d Their teeth were very sharp, so we made their arms bleed! Then . . . they got punched several times.Of course, they didn\u2019t need to tell their brother about this kind of detail.He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng talked a lot about how they dealt with Liu Heitou and his men, and they also talked about how Liu Heitou was beaten up by Jiang Zhen.\u201cJiang Zhen is really fierce. Liu Heitou came to him, looking for trouble, but he beat him up so easily. He didn\u2019t even dare to fart as he left.\u201dHe Qiusheng\u2019s eyes brightened.When He Chunsheng saw his younger brother like this, his heart jumped. He knew that Jiang Zhen was not interested in his younger brother, but he was somewhat afraid that his younger brother would have a crush on Jiang Zhen, so he hurriedly said, \u201cThat Zhao Jinge is also very strong. He was not inferior to your brother and me in fighting.\u201d Zhao Jinge is very good at fighting, so you\u2019d better stay away from them . . .He Qiusheng\u2019s mouth curled up. His parents always told him to stay at home and dress up. What is the use of fighting others? Besides, he didn\u2019t want Jiang Zhen! He had a lot of people who liked him!Although He Qiusheng thought like this, his eyes couldn\u2019t help reddening.He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng hurriedly started coaxing him, and soon the three of them were talking and laughing again, but as soon as they got home, they were scolded by their father.\u201cYou two stinky brats! I heard that you helped the Zhao family deal with Liu Heitou? Do you want to die? What if Liu Heitou comes to trouble our family again?\u201d\u201cYou three debt collectors, the debt I owe can\u2019t be helped, but you are in such a hurry to offend Liu Heitou!\u201dAs Father He scolded them, he picked up a broom and was about to start hitting his two sons. He usually didn\u2019t hit He Qiusheng for fear of damaging his face.It had always been taken for granted in Hexi that parents could teach their children a lesson. In the past, even if He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were not happy about it, they were obedient and let Father He beat them, but now . . . He Chunsheng suddenly couldn\u2019t bear it.Jiang Zhen was so powerful that he could not only beat up Liu Heitou, but he could also make his relatives so obedient. But they . . . they couldn\u2019t even control their own father, could they?\u201cHusband, don\u2019t hit the children . . .\u201d Mother He tried to stop her husband but was slapped in the face with the broom he was holding.The broom held by Father He was made of thin bamboo sticks. When he hit her, this action immediately drew blood on Mother He\u2019s face.He Chunsheng\u2019s face suddenly turned black. He Chunsheng grabbed the broom from his father\u2019s hand, stopping him, and then grabbed his hand. Then he said to his brother, \u201cXiasheng, go get a rope!\u201dHe was not going to beat up his father, but if his father wanted to beat them and their mother, they would tie him up!\u201cChunsheng, Chunsheng, what are you doing?\u201d Mother He, with blood on her face, asked in horror.\u201cMother, don\u2019t worry!\u201d He Chunsheng said.Mother He was a timid person and didn\u2019t dare to stop them. She only murmured, \u201cDon\u2019t hit your father . . .\u201d\u201cWe won\u2019t fight,\u201d He Chunsheng said and then, together with He Xiasheng, tied up their father, who kept swearing.When Mother He looked at her tied-up husband, she wanted to let him go. He Chunsheng said, \u201cMom, if you let him go, should I beat him next time? Xiasheng and I decided to follow Jiang Zhen. You know, he used a knife to stab his father!\u201dMother He was shocked, and now, she really didn\u2019t dare free her husband. Father He, who was originally swearing, didn\u2019t dare swear anymore.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t care about his parents, and if his two sons were to stop caring about him . . .\u201cThen . . . do you want to eat? Would you like some water?\u201d Mother He asked Father He, but was scolded; however, she was not angry. Then she asked He Qiusheng to secretly give her some cake to feed Father He.Although Father He was very grumpy at the moment, he was really hungry and ate the cake obediently.Mother He had always been an educated woman who was extraordinarily virtuous. She had always listened to Father He\u2019s words. At first, she was not used to seeing Father He tied up, but after a while, when she saw Father He eating obediently, she couldn\u2019t help saying to her son, \u201cIn fact, this is also very good . . .\u201dHe Chunsheng also thought that it was good. They finally didn\u2019t have to worry about their father going out to gamble. In fact, they really didn\u2019t mind raising their father this way. They just hoped that he wouldn\u2019t slow them down and owe money everywhere.The He family quieted down, and so did the Zhao family.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge helped Zhao Fugui and their mother clean up the house, and then they left to take a bath . . .\u201cMom, Dad, we won\u2019t eat tonight. You don\u2019t have to call us,\u201d Jiang Zhen said to Zhao Fugui and his wife, and then just when Zhao Fugui and his wife wanted to ask why he didn\u2019t want to eat, he had already dragged Zhao Jinge into their new house.Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu: \u201c. . .\u201d Both of them had been sleeping together secretly. Why are they in such a hurry?If Jiang Zhen knew what Zhao Fugui and his wife thought, he would have felt very wronged. He really hadn\u2019t eaten Zhao Jinge completely yet! God knew how long he had been waiting for their wedding to do that!When they got married, Jiang Zhen was very calm, but now . . . he was a bit nervous.Zhao Jinge was the opposite. Last night, when he slept alone in Jiang Zhen\u2019s room, he was so nervous that he almost stayed up all night worrying about this and that. When he got married today, he felt even dizzier. At some point, he felt that he couldn\u2019t even breathe . . . especially when Jiang Zhen lifted his red veil and he saw Jiang Zhen in front of him. At that moment, he only felt that his heart was about to jump out from his chest!That was his biggest dream, and today, it had come true. It was a pity that the later development was not what he had imagined, meaning, this development made Zhao Jinge break away from his original emotion.At the moment, Zhao Jinge was no longer nervous, only a feeling of satisfaction lingered in his heart, and he was a little embarrassed when he asked, \u201cWhy won\u2019t we eat dinner?\u201d\u201cJinge, don\u2019t you see what time it is?\u201d Jiang Zhen sighed.It was about four o\u2019clock in the afternoon. But they just had lunch not long ago, so they wouldn\u2019t be able to eat dinner so soon. In this case, let\u2019s go to bed early!Zhao Jinge looked at the sun outside, and his mouth curved up slightly . . . At this time, he used to work for Zhao Dahu\u2019s family.Zhao Jinge had already taken a bath, and his body smelled of bath beans. Jiang Zhen hugged him and kissed him.When they weren\u2019t married, Zhao Jinge always felt that it was not good to do these things, and he was very shy. He often stiffened up uncontrollably, but now his mood had changed a lot.He was married to Jiang Zhen. He could be intimate with Jiang Zhen and even . . . He was already ugly. At this moment, Jiang Zhen wouldn\u2019t feel uncomfortable holding something hard or anything else . . .Zhao Jinge took the initiative to touch Jiang Zhen\u2019s body.Jiang Zhen only felt that the places where he was touched became numb, and he could not wait to jump him. However, Zhao Jinge suddenly said, \u201cJiang Zhen, I didn\u2019t expect that you could read. You are so powerful!\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Jiang Zhen was busy taking off his clothes.\u201cCan you teach me how to read?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked. \u201cI may be a little stupid, but can you teach me?\u201dJiang Zhen was very powerful. Zhao Jinge hoped that he could become a bit stronger too so as to not be unworthy of Jiang Zhen.\u201cAs long as you take care of me!\u201d Jiang Zhen said.He didn\u2019t want to talk about it on their wedding night! Jiang Zhen felt that he was healthy, but for the first time, he realized he was still a bit miserable. But that was mainly because it was his first time . . . The second time, his performance was very good.After tossing around like this for a long time, it had turned dark. Jiang Zhen held Zhao Jinge in his arms and slept for a while. In the middle of the night, he woke him up again. \u201cJinge, do you want to eat something?\u201d\u201cUm,\u201d Zhao Jinge answered, and Jiang Zhen got up quietly and went to the kitchen to get some leftovers.When they had enough to eat and drink, Jiang Zhen brought him to his third time.Before, Jiang Zhen felt that it was very comfortable to use his own hands, but since then, he thought that using his hands was nothing. It was really fun to use the real gun!Zhao Jinge\u2019s body looked exactly the same as that of an ordinary man, but there was also some difference. After all, he was a ger; his pelvic bones were bigger than that of a normal man, which made his waist look thinner. Zhao Jinge had big buttocks and a particularly good figure. At the same time, because he was a ger, his body was also particularly suitable for receiving.Jiang Zhen had specially bought a box of ointment for lubrication, but in the end, he didn\u2019t need it at all.Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t wait to have another round with Zhao Jinge, but he was already a bit tired, and Zhao Jinge also needed to rest . . . Holding Zhao Jinge, Jiang Zhen fell asleep with some reluctance.When Jiang Zhen fell asleep, Zhao Jinge touched his stomach and couldn\u2019t fall asleep. Zhao Jinge was not young after all, and he knew, more or less, about the things that took place in bed. Zhao Liu had also told him some things in a secretive manner. According to Zhao Liu, it was very painful, and he had to put up with it, but . . . Even though it was a bit painful, he was also very happy.Zhao Jinge felt a little embarrassed but was very happy . . . He hugged Jiang Zhen and kissed him, then he slowly fell asleep.Zhao Jinge was already in good health and took good care of himself these days. He got up early the next morning and went to prepare breakfast for Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen, who originally wanted to be affectionate with him, didn\u2019t hold him back. He just wondered if he hadn\u2019t worked hard enough last night.In fact, Jiang Zhen did work hard enough last night, and some parts of Zhao Jinge were a bit sore, but he had always been a person who could bear pain. In the past, while he was cutting rice stalks, he accidentally cut his fingers, but he continued to work without a change of expression. What did it matter if his ass hurt a little bit now? He used to have diarrhea before, and it hurt just like this.Seeing that her son had gotten up, Zhao Liu asked Zhao Jinge to cook with her.Yesterday, they couldn\u2019t finish the rice cooked at noon, so this morning, Zhao Liu simply used the cold rice to make fried rice with eggs.Putting some oil in the pot, she stir-fried the beaten eggs and then put them on the rice. . . Ever since she had grown to particularly love soy sauce, Zhao Liu finally decided to not put salt but soy sauce seasoning instead. Of course, there was also a reason for this. Salt was very clumpy in this era. When cooking fried rice, if they really needed to put salt in, they had to dissolve it in water. Otherwise, it would not be fried rice with eggs, but fried rice with salt. If that was the case, it was better to put soy sauce directly.After the meal was ready, Zhao Jinge first filled Jiang Zhen\u2019s bowl with eggs. Seeing that Jiang Zhen had not come out of their house yet, he went to the house directly with the bowl.He was so happy to marry Jiang Zhen that he was always thinking about doing things for Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen did not get up. On one hand, he was thinking about what to do today, and on the other hand, his breakfast was not ready yet.When he lived alone, he was a very diligent person. He got up early in the morning to cook and could sew clothes for himself, but now that someone was serving him, he became lazy. Of course, he still rushed to do the heavy work at home.Before, Jiang Zhen always thought it was okay to be lazy for a while, but now . . . on the second day of their new marriage, his ger brought their meal to bed and gave him something to eat . . . Forget it.\u201cI\u2019ll go out and eat,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cWell, there is still meat in the kitchen. Shall I heat it up for you?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked.\u201cAlright,\u201d Jiang Zhen agreed.With hot fried rice in his stomach, he was immediately in high spirits. After eating, Jiang Zhen looked at Zhao Jinge and said, \u201cJinge, come with me to the county town.\u201d\u201cAlright. I\u2019ll help you with the goods,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.He already knew that Jiang Zhen was going to deliver the porcelain to the county town that day. Although he didn\u2019t know how to talk business, he was still strong enough to help him move the goods.Jiang Zhen: \u201c. . .\u201d Honey, you will make me look useless!Jiang Zhen insisted on not letting Zhao Jinge work. He took Wang Haisheng and the He brothers, who came early in the morning, and soon moved all the porcelain to the boat. Then they all rowed to the county town.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Even so, Father He behaved like an honest person and didn\u2019t dare to make any noise at home.Without Father He being noisy, they immediately felt much more relaxed and slept very well that night.Not to mention . . . they all had enough to eat that day and the day before. The day before, they ate at Zhao Jinge and Jiang Zhen\u2019s wedding and the day after . . . the He family ran out of rice, but He Chunsheng let He Qiusheng go to their uncle\u2019s house for a meal. But he and He Xiasheng couldn\u2019t. Early in the morning, they went to the Zhaos\u2019 house hungry, thinking that they would starve all day. They didn\u2019t expect that Jiang Zhen would give them two bowls of rice to eat, and when they finished eating, they were asked to move the porcelain.Did Jiang Zhen accept them? Would they be able to follow Jiang Zhen in the future? He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng immediately went to work, and the people on the boat could not help but look at them secretly. Their faces were bruised and swollen like this, but they were still happy. Are they really alright?Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t stay on the bow of the boat for long but took Zhao Jinge inside the cabin.In order to have more room for cargo, the space for people to rest within the cabin was made much smaller by Jiang Zhen, but even so, he still had two beds\u2014he really didn\u2019t want to share a bed with Wang Haisheng.These two beds were very narrow, less than one meter in width; one was on the left and the other one on the right side of the cabin. There were also containers underneath for storing things, and there were shelves above. For that reason, one could only lie down and not sit.\u201cJinge, do you want to lie down and have a rest?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked, the beautiful feeling from last night made him always want to hug him when he looked at Zhao Jinge.How nice would it be for two people to squeeze together in such a narrow bed? He made a curtain out of cloth, so he didn\u2019t have to worry about anyone seeing them!\u201cNo. Are you tired? Go lie down, and I\u2019ll look after you.\u201d Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t pay any attention to the deeper meaning behind Jiang Zhen\u2019s words. Instead, he looked at Jiang Zhen with concern.Jiang Zhen: \u201c. . . I\u2019m not tired.\u201d So it\u2019s better to push him down directly!Jiang Zhen pulled Zhao Jinge to the bed. As soon as he laid down, Zhao Jinge stiffened up and breathed faster.This was not their house, nor was it their bedroom . . . Zhao Jinge lay motionless and faced a problem\u2014if Jiang Zhen really tried to do something, should he agree or refuse?\u201cJinge, we are here.\u201d Jiang Zhen kissed Zhao Jinge, who had been nervous the entire way to the county town; they had already arrived.There were many rivers in Hecheng County. Some of them were originally there, and some of them were dug out for convenience. There was also a river behind the porcelain shop, as well as stone steps leading to the river.Jiang Zhen stopped the boat there, picked up the shopkeeper of the porcelain shop, and then took the shopkeeper with him to the place where he had brought his porcelain.\u201cJiang Zhen, the one who wants to buy your porcelain is the steward of the Zheng mansion in the county town. The Zheng family is one of the largest families in the county town. Be careful when you go there,\u201d said the shopkeeper of the porcelain shop.\u201cYou can rest assured, Shopkeeper. I will.\u201d Jiang Zhen knew how to behave.The house of the Zhengs had been there for some years; its main door was facing the street, and its back door, the river. Jiang Zhen and his group, without asking questions, went to the back door.It was no longer early, and two servant girls dressed in blue were washing clothes by the river. When they saw Jiang Zhen\u2019s party, they were asked to announce them. After a while, the housekeeper of the Zheng mansion came out with two other servants.Before, when Jiang Zhen had gone out to do business, he had gained a lot of experience. He didn\u2019t feel there was anything to this kind of scene, but Zhao Jinge and He Chunsheng were very uncomfortable, and they didn\u2019t even dare to look at these people, keeping their heads down.Jiang Zhen had to do a lot of things today. In fact, it would have been more convenient not to bring Zhao Jinge. But he brought Zhao Jinge anyway. If nothing else, he hoped that Zhao Jinge would see a bit more of the world outside.If he only cared about going ahead and kept Zhao Jinge in Hexi, the distance between him and Zhao Jinge would certainly increase more and more . . .Holding Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand, Jiang Zhen soon let go of him and went up to talk with the shopkeeper.Such a big family had its standards of conduct, and the price that had already been negotiated before would not be changed easily. Jiang Zhen only needed to help move the porcelain into the warehouse and then he would get the money.This time, to speed up the process, even Zhao Jinge helped move the goods, and no one thought it was wrong for him to do so.Zhao Jinge, who was fully dressed in men\u2019s clothes, looked just like a man. If someone didn\u2019t know him, looking at his tall body, they wouldn\u2019t even think he was a ger.\u201cThe warehouse is over there. Just move it there and put it down.\u201d Steward Zheng just finished speaking when he suddenly stopped and then saluted in one direction, \u201cYoung Master!\u201dWhen Jiang Zhen looked over, he saw a young man around twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old standing not far away.This man must have just got up because he still looked a bit sleepy. He only wore a very bright robe, which was very different from the gray clothes worn by ordinary people in that era. But he still refused to put it on neatly.When he heard Steward Zheng\u2019s words, he replied casually, but after accidentally seeing He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng, he couldn\u2019t help laughing. \u201cUncle Zheng, where did these two pig heads come from?\u201d\u201cYoung Master, they are here to deliver porcelain,\u201d Steward Zheng said somewhat helplessly.The young man laughed again and then left. But before leaving, he said, \u201cHey, you two, you\u2019d better heal your faces at home before you come out again haha.\u201dHe Chunsheng and He Xiasheng lowered their heads, a bit ashamed.However, the young man was probably a nobleman, so they could not afford to be dissatisfied with his teasing.Jiang Zhen took a look at them, and then his eyes fell on Zhao Jinge. When he saw Zhao Jinge\u2019s cramped appearance, he suddenly felt a bit uneasy.This shipment of porcelain sold for more than one hundred silver in total. Apart from the share given to the manager of the porcelain shop and the filial respect given to Steward Zheng, in the end Jiang Zhen got 105 silver.Jiang Zhen gave He Chunsheng two silver, Wang Haisheng two silver, and then gave the rest to Zhao Jinge.One hundred silver was not light, it was actually quite heavy. Zhao Jinge held the silver and was a bit confused. \u201cThis . . . This . . .\u201d\u201cYou keep it,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.When Zhao Jinge went out, he had taken a convenient bamboo basket with him, so he wrapped up the silver and put it in the basket. He didn\u2019t dare to carry the basket on his back now, so he held it in his arms, and got nervous again.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t comfort him. This man\u2019s nervousness would get better slowly.\u201cBoss, let\u2019s go back quickly.\u201d He Chunsheng was also very nervous. As long as he thought that Zhao Jinge had a hundred silver with him, he got very worried and afraid. He thought that the people around them might do bad things to them and try to rob them.But Wang Haisheng was much calmer; he had seen even more silver.\u201cNo, we still have something else to do,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. He thought about it for a moment and asked Wang Haisheng and the He brothers to stay and watch the boat, then he took Zhao Jinge to a shop selling ink, paper, and inkstone.This time, Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge were dressed in their new clothes. Although they still didn\u2019t look like scholars, they would not be looked down upon by others. When they entered the shop, someone immediately came up to greet them.Nowadays, there were several kinds of paper, not only rice paper. After Jiang Zhen asked for some hard paper, the shopkeeper immediately took out some hard paper for drawing.The price of this paper was not cheap, but it didn\u2019t distress Jiang Zhen, who had some money on his hands at this moment.\u201cJinge, pay,\u201d Jiang Zhen said to Zhao Jinge as he chose some paper dyes and even picked out a scholarly book.Such things cost three silver . . . Zhao Jinge was reluctant to take the money out, but after a glance at Jiang Zhen, he still took the money out of the bamboo basket and then carefully put all the things bought by Jiang Zhen in the bamboo basket.Zhao Jinge seldom came to the county town in the past, and even if he did, he never dared to go inside many shops. At the moment, he suddenly visited such a shop where only scholars visited, and he also bought three-silver worth of things at once. He suddenly felt that he was a completely different person.Jiang Zhen took Zhao Jinge to make cards, and at the same time, Liu Heitou, who let his people apply medicine on his face, also went to the county town.He had become the leader of the thugs in that gambling house, and usually, he only needed to let his subordinates watch over the games there. But today, he decided to go there in person.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know what this meant . . . Liu Heitou intended to go to the gambling house and ask the people he knew to give a gift to the gambling house manager and inquire about Jiang Zhen.If Jiang Zhen actually had any background, he could be recognized by these things, but Jiang Zhen had no background . . .After touching his face covered with herbal medicine, Liu Heitou\u2019s eyes flashed with a trace of ruthlessness.Making cards was not difficult.Instead of using Arabic numbers, Jiang Zhen wrote, \u201c1,\u201d \u201c2.\u201c \u201c3,\u201d \u201c4\u201d to \u201c13\u201d on the cards and then drew patterns with black and red dyes. Finally, he took out two blank cards that he planned to represent the king and the queen.In modern times, Jiang Zhen would definitely write \u201cEmperor\u201d and \u201cEmpress\u201d on these two cards, but in that era, it would be absolutely fatal to write so . . . Jiang Zhen wrote: \u201cTiger\u201d with red ink on two cards and \u201cTiger\u201d with black ink on the others. The king card became the tiger card.After that, Jiang Zhen took Zhao Jinge out again.He had asked Yang Jing to help him make an appointment with the gambling house manager for a drink. Although it was not yet time, they could go and wait there in advance.There was only one restaurant in the whole county town, and it was there Jiang Zhen had made the appointment to meet. Zhao Jinge refused to come to such a place before, but this time, Jiang Zhen had serious work to do, so he didn\u2019t try to stop him. Finally, he followed Jiang Zhen gingerly in the restaurant and went to the second floor.There were no private rooms on the second floor of the restaurant, but the environment was relatively better. As soon as Jiang Zhen went upstairs, he saw the young master of the Zheng family, who he had seen before in the Zheng mansion, sitting idly on a chair, drinking wine alone with his legs on the table.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He kept looking out of the window.\u201cIt\u2019s still early. You can stay by the window first,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cWould it be good?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked worriedly. Apart from them, there were many people here. Would he make Jiang Zhen lose face if he were to stand by the window and stare outside?\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled, but Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t see it at all. If he wanted to look, in his opinion, there was nothing embarrassing about it.When Jiang Zhen said this, Zhao Jinge went to the window and looked out with his eyes wide open.The restaurant only had two floors, so he couldn\u2019t actually see anything special from this window. But for Zhao Jinge, this was still a very novel experience, as he looked around with relish.\u201cJiang Zhen, we are above other people\u2019s heads now,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cPuff!\u201d Thinking that Zhao Jinge\u2019s behavior was funny, Young Master Zheng laughed.Jiang Zhen frowned slightly while Zhao Jinge sat down with an embarrassed look on his face.\u201cJinge, let\u2019s play cards,\u201d Jiang Zhen, seeing Zhao Jinge sitting restlessly, said to him.Zhao Jinge was confused, but Jiang Zhen took out the cards. He left out the tiger cards and straightened out the remaining fifty-two cards before dealing himself and Zhao Jinge five cards each and putting the rest of the cards on the table.\u201cThis is the simplest way to play. When you have a card in your hands, and the cards on the table are laid, you can use a card in your hand to pick up a card from the table. It can be one card or two cards or even three cards. Then you can switch one card from the top of the row to make up for the five cards in your hand, and switch one card, and put it on the table. If it can\u2019t add up to fourteen, you can switch one card from the pile and put it on. Then it\u2019s my turn,\u201d Jiang Zhen briefly explained the rules. When he was a child, others taught him how to play. At that time, they called this game \u201cgo fish.\u201d However, some areas seemed to not play it this way.Zhao Jinge was able to do some simple arithmetic, but he was relatively slow. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t teach him, so he stumbled a little bit while Jiang Zhen was the opposite.\u201cSeven and three on the table add up to ten. I have a four here. I will switch two cards.\u201d Jiang Zhen switched two cards on the table with one and four.The rest of the cards were of bigger numbers. Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t have any cards to fish, so he could only switch one to put it on the table. As a result, that card was taken away by Jiang Zhen again.Zhao Jinge got very good cards in the first game, and when they started all over, he also found a way.There were not many cards, and after all, it was not very difficult to calculate the number of these cards to fourteen. The longer he calculated them, the faster he was getting.After three games, Jiang Zhen proposed to Zhao Jinge a different way of playing; this game was suitable for children and was not very attractive to adults.\u201cThere are only two of us, so we can only play something simple. Let\u2019s try 21,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. Twenty-one was also called blackjack and could be regarded as one of the classical ways of playing cards. Jiang Zhen explained to Zhao Jinge how to play. Then they started playing.Before that, Young Master Zheng was just looking at them. Soon, he could not help standing beside them to watch, and then later, he stood behind Zhao Jinge and said to Zhao Jinge in a very conservative tone, \u201cYou need a card! Your cards are too small. Why don\u2019t you add a card?\u201dZhao Jinge shook his head as he said, \u201cI don\u2019t want to.\u201d What if he got one of those big cards?Seeing Zhao Jinge like this, Young Master Zheng was frustrated. He wished he could play and do it differently . . .\u201cDoes Master Zheng want to come and play too?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.\u201cYes!\u201d Young Master Zheng directly sat down beside Jiang Zhen without asking him why he already knew how to play by himself.When Jiang Zhen saw this, he said, \u201cI\u2019ll deal two cards first. After you\u2019ve seen them, you can place a bet . . . I don\u2019t have much money, so you can\u2019t bet more than five coppers at a time.\u201dYoung Master Zhen stopped smiling. \u201cI don\u2019t take coins when I go out.\u201d The coins were heavy, so he never took any when he went out. Of course, the servant boy around him would take some, but at the moment, the boy was not there.After thinking about it, Master Zheng directly called the waiter and asked him to bring one hundred copper coins. Then Young Master Zheng started bravely adding cards.He was very adventurous, so when his first two cards added up to fifteen, he asked without hesitation for another card. This way, he would surpass twenty-one if he were even a little careless. In contrast, Jiang Zhen was very conservative, so soon after, all one hundred copper coins in front of him became his.Of course, overall, he didn\u2019t win all the games, he just won more than he lost.\u201cBring some more!\u201d Young Master Zheng asked the waiter to get more copper coins.\u201cWait.\u201d This time, Jiang Zhen stopped Young Master Zheng.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Young Master Zheng asked. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I can afford to lose.\u201d\u201cNo, the person I am meeting is here,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, as he had already heard Yang Jing\u2019s voice.Sure enough, after a while, Yang Jing came up the stairs together with a very fat middle-aged man.Yang Jing was very respectful to this middle-aged man. \u201cManager Zhang, please come upstairs. My brother is upstairs.\u201dManager Zhang was indifferent to Yang Jing, putting on airs, but after he went upstairs, he couldn\u2019t continue doing so. \u201cYoung Master?\u201dYang Jing also looked with surprise at Young Master Zheng. \u201cYoung Master Zheng?\u201d This . . . Jiang Zhen was sitting with Young Master Zheng?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

That casino was under Young Master Zheng\u2019s control. Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t make an appointment with Young Master Zheng, so he made an appointment with the casino manager, but it turned out unnecessary.Jiang Zhen knew Young Master Zheng\u2019s identity. After all, the day before, he had asked Yang Jing in detail. However, he didn\u2019t know that the one who wanted to buy his porcelain was the Zheng family.At that time, even if he had known it, it would have been useless. After all, as a porcelain seller, even if he wanted to have some relationship with the Zheng family, he would not be able to do so by merely wishing it.However, he was lucky. After coming to the restaurant ahead of time, he saw Young Master Zheng sitting there . . . Jiang Zhen wanted to give the cards to the manager, but now . . . he could gain more benefits by giving these cards to Young Master Zheng.\u201cYou asked him out? Don\u2019t worry about that. You can keep playing with me,\u201d Young Master Zheng said. \u201cWhat else can we play with these cards?\u201d\u201cThere are dozens of ways to play with these cards,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. \u201cDoes Young Master Zheng want to see the game suitable for the casino or the one suitable for the family to pass the time?\u201d\u201cI want to see both!\u201d Young Master Zheng said without hesitation.For the time being, it was impossible for Jiang Zhen to show all the ways of playing. In fact, he himself didn\u2019t remember much. In the end, he demonstrated only two methods of playing, one was Bullfighting, also known as Niuniu, and the other was Fight the Landlord.These were only three ways of playing. But after a whole afternoon of playing, they were not bored at all.\u201cIt\u2019s getting late, Young Master Zheng.\u201d Jiang Zhen reminded him that he would like to go home for dinner.\u201cAnd . . .\u201d Young Master Zheng reluctantly put down the cards in his hand, and then asked Jiang Zhen, \u201cDid you come up with this yourself? How much do you want?\u201dYoung Master Zheng\u2019s real name was Zheng Yi. He was very fond of and very proficient in playing. After playing all afternoon, he had already discovered the value of this set of cards. After pondering for a while, he felt that Jiang Zhen might have attracted his attention on purpose. Of course, if they hadn\u2019t met, Jiang Zhen would have gone to the person in charge under him.After taking a look at the manager, who was thinking the same thing, Zheng Yi felt that Jiang Zhen came to them mostly for the sake of money.\u201cYoung Master Zheng, someone taught me this, but I\u2019m sure that only a few of us in Daqi can play it now. But . . . it\u2019s not about money,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cYou don\u2019t want money? So what do you want? Tell me,\u201d Young Master Zheng asked. He had never seen these cards before. If he could offer them . . . maybe all the ladies in the palace would like them very much. Even if he didn\u2019t offer the cards to them, they were also good for his casino.\u201cAs a matter of fact, I made an appointment with Manager Zhang today because I offended the people from the gambling shop. With these cards, I want to make amends,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cYou offended the gambling house staff?\u201d Young Master Zheng looked at Manager Zhang.Manager Zhang was also somewhat shocked. Did Jiang Zhen offend them? He knew nothing about it! He had never seen Jiang Zhen before.\u201cI beat up Liu Heitou from your gambling shop. He has many people under him, so I\u2019m afraid it is not good for my family,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cWho is Liu Heitou?\u201d Young Master Zheng asked again. Was there such a person in his gambling shop?\u201cLittle Hei, the big and young one,\u201d Manager Zhang said.\u201cAh, it\u2019s Little Hei . . . You could beat him?\u201d Young Master Zheng looked at Jiang Zhen with some surprise. Liu Heitou was one of the best fighters under him.\u201cYou don\u2019t know this, Young Master Zheng, but Eldest Brother is very powerful. He can even defeat ten people by himself. Yesterday, our Eldest Brother was getting married, but Liu Heitou showed up to make trouble. He even brought many people with him, but was still beaten . . . I thought that Liu Heitou would not give up, so I helped him make an appointment with Manager Zheng to resolve things and make peace,\u201d Yang Jing said with a smile, praising Jiang Zhen.At this moment, Yang Jing had already made up his mind to mix with Jiang Zhen. He was getting more and more convinced that Jiang Zhen was a capable man. Even regarding these cards, he didn\u2019t know how he came up with it. After playing with them, he felt that it was too boring for him to play dice like before.Zheng Yi always thought that Jiang Zhen should have been thinking about it for a long time and finally came up with something interesting. So then he found their Zheng family and wanted to rely on this thing to make money, but unexpectedly . . . This man actually beat one of his thugs and wanted to make amends.\u201cIt\u2019s just a small fight with Little Hei. It\u2019s nothing. What else do you want?\u201d Zheng Yi asked again.\u201cMaster Zheng, I don\u2019t want anything in particular . . . Why don\u2019t you give me a name at the gambling house? You don\u2019t have to give me money or work, as long as you can take care of Liu Heitou,\u201d Jiang Zhen said with a smile.Hearing this, Zheng Yi burst out laughing. \u201cYou\u2019re very interesting. No problem. You\u2019ll be one of the managers of the gambling house in the future, like Manager Zhang, and your monthly salary will be the same as Manager Zhang\u2019s. If you don\u2019t want to be in charge of the gambling house, you can leave it to others. If you like, I\u2019ll leave it to you to take care of the card-related matters.\u201dThe gambling shop was just one of Zheng Yi\u2019s industries. For him, it was really nothing to let Jiang Zhen be in change, and now it was settled.Such conditions far exceeded Jiang Zhen\u2019s initial plan. Naturally, Jiang Zhen would not decline the offer. He smiled and thanked him. And just like that, Jiang Zhen became one of the managers of the gambling house.Meanwhile, Liu Heitou was talking about Jiang Zhen to the people in the gambling house.Liu Heitou had been working in the gambling house for more than ten years and got to know a lot of people. When those people heard that Liu Heitou had been beaten, they comforted him one after another and said they would help him get revenge.Liu Heitou thanked them.\u201cChief Liu, who is the one who dared to hit you? What is he like?\u201d one of Liu Heitou\u2019s men asked.\u201cThat man\u2019s name is Jiang Zhen. I don\u2019t know exactly where he came from,\u201d Liu Heitou said.He suspected that Jiang Zhen had a background, but when he thought about it carefully, he concluded that Jiang Zhen shouldn\u2019t have any background. He was a farmer born and raised in Hexi Village. What kind of background can he have?\u201cDon\u2019t worry, Chief Liu. We\u2019re all on your side, and we won\u2019t let him off!\u201d someone said to Liu Heitou.\u201cYes, we won\u2019t let him off!\u201d the rest of them added.Just at this moment, someone from outside ran in. \u201cManager Zhang is back!\u201dHearing that Manager Zhang had come back, Liu Heitou quickly stood up intending to greet him. At the same time, he also wanted to ask Manager Zhang to help him inquire about Jiang Zhen.But, as it happened . . . Liu Heitou went out to find Manager Zhang and unexpectedly saw a person he didn\u2019t expect to appear there . . .\u201cJiang Zhen?!\u201d Liu Heitou was shocked to see that man who walked side by side with Manager Zhang and doubted if he had seen right.However, he was not wrong. That person was Jiang Zhen and even Zhao Jinge was with him!\u201cLittle Hei!\u201d Manager Zhang frowned at Liu Heitou and said, \u201cShow some respect! This is the new manager, Jiang. From now on, you will treat him as you treat me.\u201d Manager Zhang didn\u2019t want to share power with anyone, but he was very clear on Zheng Yi\u2019s character.The young master looked very talkative and easy to talk to in general, but if someone didn\u2019t listen to him . . . He remembered the fate of some blatantly disobedient shopkeeper. As a consequence, Manager Zhang was kinder to Jiang Zhen. Anyway, as long as he did his job well, he would not be treated badly by the young master.\u201cManager Jiang?\u201d Liu Heitou turned silly. What was Jiang Zhen\u2019s background? He\u2014all of a sudden, he became the person in charge of their casino?The people who had originally agreed with Liu Heitou to help him get revenge were now silent. Earlier, Liu Heitou said that the man who beat him up was Jiang Zhen, so this new manager was the one who beat him?They were all working in the gambling house and they couldn\u2019t offend the management of the gambling house . . . At the moment, some people were even planning to curry favor with Jiang Zhen. He was now in change. There had to be a reason!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Jiang Zhen walked for a while, but soon noticed that Zhao Jinge, who was holding the bamboo basket, was a bit out of shape, so he turned around and took his hand.Zhao Jinge was started and subconsciously broke free. Fearing that Jiang Zhen would be unhappy, he said, \u201cThere are a lot of people here, it\u2019s not very good . . .\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s getting dark now, and there\u2019s no one left,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, firmly taking Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand and by the way taking away the bamboo basket that Zhao Jinge was holding. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dAlthough Zhao Jinge felt a little ashamed to be held by the hand, he could not deny that he was also somewhat happy with it. He bowed his head and followed behind Jiang Zhen, adjusting his pace to that of Jiang Zhen. At the same time, his heart slowly settled down.Everything before had been a bit of a shock to Zhao Jinge, but then he was stunned. Jiang Zhen unexpectedly became the manager of the gambling shop . . .\u201cJinge, come to the county town with me tomorrow,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going,\u201d Zhao Jinge quickly refused. He hadn\u2019t done much today. Later, while Jiang Zhen was playing cards, he could only hold the bamboo basket and observe them. Not only was he useless but he also made Jiang Zhen lose face. He thought it would be better not to follow Jiang Zhen to the county town.\u201cWhy?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked\u201cThere is still a lot of work to do at home. The land we bought hasn\u2019t been planted yet . . . ,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cHe Chunsheng and He Xiasheng can plant the fields and work at home,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, squeezing Zhao Jinge\u2019s hand. \u201cThere are all kinds of things happening in this county town, and there are many people who would marry young ones. I met a shopkeeper before, his wife was helping him take care of his mother and children in the countryside, but his concubine accompanied him to the county town. He only goes back to the countryside once or twice a year and flirts with his concubine. Also there are many women and gers in this county town who are not living well, so they opened their doors to do business at night . . . You should also know what this business is. I heard that Yang Jing often goes there . . .\u201dZhao Jinge suddenly opened his eyes wide. \u201cI\u2019ll go with you tomorrow.\u201d\u201cHmm.\u201d Jiang Zhen nodded calmly.Zhao Jinge did not want Jiang Zhen to find someone else, but he felt that he was useless and there was a big gap between him and Jiang Zhen.He looked at Jiang Zhen with a tangled expression and finally made up his mind. He would follow Jiang Zhen closely, unless he forbade him to do so.Jiang Zhen was very satisfied with Zhao Jinge\u2019s attitude.At present, the poor basically raised their ger children as women, but he always regarded Zhao Jinge as a man. In his opinion, Zhao Jinge was no worse than the others.He could train Wang Haisheng, so there was no way he would not teach Zhao Jinge.Thinking about it, Zhao Jinge would surely be better than Wang Haisheng in all aspects. Today, when they played cards, Zhao Jinge learned it very quickly. What about Wang Haisheng? They had been selling kelp for more than ten days, and he still made mistakes when he wasn\u2019t careful.After a while, Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge arrived at the place where they had stopped the boat. By this time, Wang Haisheng was already anxious.\u201cWhy haven\u2019t Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge come back yet?\u201d\u201cI saw Liu Heitou come to the county town before. Do you think it was Liu Heitou . . .\u201d\u201cNo! Think how powerful our boss is!\u201d\u2026All of a sudden, Wang Haisheng exclaimed, \u201cLook, the boss is back!\u201dWhen He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng looked over, they saw Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge coming back hand in hand and they suddenly felt a little uncomfortable.In their village, even the weakest little daughter-in-law would not let her husband hold hands when they went out. Zhao Jinge was even taller than them. How could he be so sticky with Jiang Zhen? Jiang Zhen was indulging him and he obviously liked Zhao Jinge very much.It was a good thing their brother didn\u2019t bother them too much, otherwise . . .He Chunsheng secretly breathed a sigh of relief, but Wang Haisheng asked, \u201cBoss, why are you just coming back now?\u201d\u201cI got a job in the county town,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cBoss, you found a job in the county town? What is it?\u201d Wang Haisheng asked again.\u201cManager of the gambling shop,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cManager?\u201d How did Jiang Zhen become a manager after going out for one afternoon?\u201cWell, ten silver a month,\u201d Jiang Zhen said again.\u201cTen silver a month!\u201d Wang Haisheng looked at Jiang Zhen in worship. He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng were also shocked.At the beginning, when Jiang Chengxiang found a job for two silver per month in the county town, he was already one of the most promising people in their village. Now . . . how could Jiang Zhen get ten silver a month?This . . . if he saved up for a year, he would be able to buy five mu of land!When Jiang Zhen and the others returned to Hexi Village, it was already completely dark, but up until then Wang Haisheng and the others were still confused.Jiang Zhen\u2026 he was really amazing!The ship slowly approached Hexi Village and after stopping at the place where it had been docked before, Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge came out of the cabin together. As soon as they walked out, they saw several people on the shore.\u201cDad!\u201d Zhao Jinge shouted. It was Zhao Fugui, who was waiting for them on the shore.\u201cDad, what are you doing here?\u201d Jiang Zhen also asked, feeling warm at the same time. In the modern era, he was not an orphan, but his parents divorced when he was very young, so he lived with his grandmother.Both of his parents remarried and did not welcome him. Even his grandmother preferred his stepmother\u2019s children . . . Later, when his grandmother died, those people refused to support him or pay for his high school tuition, so he completely cut off the contact with them.He had never received love from his parents before, but not when he was already an adult he received it from Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu . . .In the past, he particularly envied those classmates who were picked up from school, but now he also experienced it for once.\u201cI just came to take a look around,\u201d Zhao Fugui said. \u201cDo you want to bring something? You\u2019ve been busy all day. I\u2019ll carry it.\u201d\u201cNo, the porcelain is all sold out. We don\u2019t have anything to take now,\u201d Jiang Zhen said, following Zhao Fugui as they walked home.Before, in front of Wang Haisheng, Jiang Zhen showed off a little, but in front of Zhao Fugui, he didn\u2019t say anything. Yet even if he didn\u2019t say it, Zhao Jinge would.Soon, Zhao Jinge said that Jiang Zhen would be the manager of the gambling shop.\u201cGambling shop?\u201d Zhao Fugui frowned slightly.It was really good to be in charge, but a manager of the gambling house . . . He was afraid that Jiang Zhen would be led astray by the people in the gambling shop. It was just that he couldn\u2019t talk about it in front of Jiang Zhen, so he intended to find an opportunity to mention it to Zhao Jinge tomorrow and let him keep an eye on Jiang Zhen and not let him become addicted to gambling.Zhao Fugui didn\u2019t say much, but Jiang Zhen could already guess his thoughts. \u201cDad, don\u2019t worry. Gambling is not good. I won\u2019t do these things.\u201dZhao Fugui was immediately relieved. \u201cGood! Alright!\u201dJiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge returned home very late, but Zhao Liu had put the dishes on the steaming rack, and these were still warm. The dishes did not even seem to have been touched, the rice in the pot was still full. Zhao Fugui and his wife probably had eaten the cold rice left over the day before.\u201cWe\u2019ve already eaten, so hurry up and eat!\u201d Zhao Liu said with a smile.\u201cHmm.\u201d Jiang Zhen nodded and filled his bowl with rice and ate it. After eating, he took out the silver he earned after selling porcelain today from the bamboo basket.Although he had spent some money on buying paper, he later won some money from Zheng Yi and others, so at this moment there was still a little over a hundred silver left.\u201cMom, Dad, I have made another hundred silver from selling porcelain today. Keep it first, and then go to see if you can buy some more land.\u201d Jiang Zhen said. Zhao Fugui and his wife were used to living a hard life and were reluctant to eat good things, but if their family had more money and land, they would be willing to eat better.Another one hundred silver? Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui were so shocked that, for a moment, they were unable to recover. Why did Jiang Zhen do something to frighten them from time to time?\u201cThis . . . This . . .\u201d Zhao Fugui was at a loss. \u201cShall we build a house?\u201dPeople in their village liked to build houses when they had some extra money. They built houses in a very magnificent manner, but Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t think it was necessary.Some people in the village had no money to buy furniture and daily necessities after their houses were built. Although they lived in a big house, it was empty or there were only left in rags. In that case, it was better to live in a smaller house and use the things at home better. In particular, they had to eat better!Jiang Zhen refused the proposal to build a house, and Zhao Fugui thought it was also very good \u201cYes, for now our house is enough, it is better to buy some more land first. With the land, how can you worry about not having a house?\u201dZhao Fugui took the money and went back to his room with Zhao Liu, and Jiang Zhen took Zhao Jinge to have a bath. \u201cJinge, shall I wipe your back?\u201dWipe his back? Zhao Jinge was a little embarrassed, but he was reluctant to refuse Jiang Zhen, so in the end he gritted his teeth and said, \u201cOkay.\u201dJiang Zhen said he would wipe the back but as a result he scrubbed the front too. He also washed the parts that Zhao Jinge had only showed to his husband several times, which made Zhao Jinge wish to dig a hole in the ground.\u201cI\u2019ll kiss it later, so I must wash it clean,\u201d Jiang Zhen said with a smile. He was just a novice last night, so he was so excited that he didn\u2019t pay much attention to pleasing Zhao Jinge. But it was different today . . .When Zhao Jinge heard Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, he only thought that Jiang Zhen was talking nonsense. He never expected that after they got in bed, Jiang Zhen would actually taste it.Zhao Jinge knew a thing or two about men and women, but he really didn\u2019t know that he could do this with his mouth . . .Jiang Zhen was willing to do such a thing to him . . .At the end of the day, Zhao Jinge convulsed, softened, and was unable to move\u2026Then Jiang Zhen turned him over and began enjoying himself. It was not enough to toss in bed once, so after a short rest, he tossed Zhao Jinge while facing each other.The excitement of this night was even greater for Zhao Jinge than on their wedding night. Jiang Zhen was also satisfied to see his soft and weak appearance.On the other side, Zhao Fugui and his wife, who couldn\u2019t sleep because of the silver, were a bit conflicted.Although there was almost no sound coming from Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge, there were occasional creaking sounds . . .They were afraid that the new bed would break down in a few years.Alas, they were young and unexpectedly could toss for so long . . .Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge had a great time that evening. But Liu Heitou, who stayed in the gambling shop in the county town, felt that he was really unlucky.He specially went to manager Zhang and gave him a lot of money. As a result, he got one sentence from Manager Zhang. \u201cThe young master values Jiang Zhen very much.\u201dThe young master unexpectedly attached great importance to that Jiang Zhen!Who was the young master! That was the person they all were afraid of offending and he actually attached great importance to that Jiang Zhen!Liu Heitou felt bitterness in his mouth. How could he not think of offending Jiang Zhen?Liu Heitou was the number one thug in the gambling house, but not all the thugs in the gambling house were under his command. Now they couldn\u2019t help but gloat when they learned he offended the new manager.As for the new manager . . . They didn\u2019t dare to show the slightest disobedience or disrespect to the new manager appointed by the young master himself.On the second day after his marriage, Jiang Zhen finally woke up and got up before Zhao Jinge, but he still didn\u2019t get up as early as Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui.Seeing him coming out of the house, Zhao Liu, who was already preparing breakfast, immediately asked, \u201cWhere is Jinge? Why isn\u2019t Jinge up yet? Jiang Zhen, go and wake him up! You can\u2019t let him become more and more lazy!\u201d\u201cMother, he is not awake yet. Let him sleep a little longer,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cIt\u2019s getting more and more outrageous to go to sleep so late,\u201d Zhao Liu said with a smile on her face.When Jiang Zhen treated Zhao Jinge well, it always made her happy in her heart.After Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge went out, she immediately found someone to show off. \u201cJiang Zhen is really good to my Jinge. When he got up in the morning, he was reluctant to wake him up.\u201d\u201cWhat can I do? My Jinge is getting lazier and lazier!\u201d\u201cJiang Zhen doesn\u2019t know how to save money. When he earns money, he gives it to us . . .\u201dAfter listening to Zhao Liu\u2019s words, it was inevitable that some people would go back to find trouble with their own men. \u201cLook at the Zhao family! All year round, Zhao Liu doesn\u2019t need to do any work in the field, but she still can eat delicious food at home! And how about Zhao Jinge? He grew up looking like that, and he still doesn\u2019t need to lift his hand. I\u2019m no worse than them, am I . . . I have to take care of the children, do the housework and work in the fields. How can I be with such a person like you?\u201dJiang Zhen didn\u2019t know that his letting Zhao Jinge sleep late would trigger a family war among some people in Hexi Village.This day, he didn\u2019t take Wang Haisheng and the others with him. Instead, he went to the county town with Zhao Jinge. Zhao Jinge wanted to learn how to row the boat, so he taught him.After they got to the county town, they didn\u2019t go to the gambling house but went to the Zheng family.Yesterday\u2019s deck of cards had been taken away by Zheng Yi, who had asked Jiang Zhen to come early today, saying that he wanted to discuss with him how to make these cards and how to promote them. It would be best if they couldn\u2019t be imitated in a short period of time, so they could earn more.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

But this time, they were treated differently. There were a lot of servant girls and young servants passing by, making Zhao Jinge put up his guard. There were really many temptations in this county town, and it had been absolutely right for him to come here with Jiang Zhen!There was a second-rank official in the Zheng family, and they were probably the richest family in the county town. Jiang Zhen thought the Zheng mansion would be very big, but after going in this time, he found that it wasn\u2019t the case even though everything around looked exquisite.As for why this mansion was not very big . . . It was probably because the county town was only so large, and there was no free land to expand the area of the house\u2014those huge gardens could only be built in the countryside.Of course, Jiang Zhen thought that the Zheng house was small because he had often seen fences enclosing large pieces of land in the countryside. As a matter of fact, the Zheng mansion was already very large in comparison to various modern houses.The place where Zheng Yi met Jiang Zhen was a pavilion built above a pond. Today, it was sunny and breezy, so it was pleasant to meet there.\u201cHere you are.\u201d Seeing Jiang Zhen, Zheng Yi yawned, stood up from the rattan recliner and sat on a stone bench beside the stone table.Although Zheng Yi was a man, his skin was very fair, since he had been raised in prosperity from childhood. Even He Qiusheng, who had the best skin in Hexi, was probably just as fair as him. At the moment, because of his particularly pale skin, the black circles and the stubble on his face were very obvious.\u201cMaster Zheng,\u201d Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge greeted him casually.\u201cSit down. Let\u2019s talk about the cards.\u201d Young Master Zheng put the cards Jiang Zhen had given him the day before on the table.The cards were made of white paper, and they already looked a little worn just from playing yesterday afternoon. Now they all looked worn out.Obviously, the reason why Zheng Yi\u2019s face had dark circles was because he had played cards all night.\u201cI played with my mother and my wife for a while after I came back yesterday, and I\u2019ve hardly slept.\u201d Zheng Yi noticed that Jiang Zhen\u2019s eyes fell on the cards and yawned again. \u201cIf they hadn\u2019t fallen asleep by now, they wouldn\u2019t have let me take the cards.\u201dBefore Jiang Zhen could speak, Zheng Yi spoke again, \u201cBut really, the card painting is too ugly.\u201d\u201c. . .\u201d Jiang Zhen had no words. \u201cI haven\u2019t gone to school and can only draw randomly. It\u2019s already very good to be able to draw like this.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t gone to school?\u201d Zheng Yi looked at Jiang Zhen with surprise. He had sent someone to check Jiang Zhen, but the time had been too short, and the people under him hadn\u2019t replied yet.However, even though he did not know Jiang Zhen\u2019s specific situation, after observing Jiang Zhen, he felt he should be a man of good birth and knowledge. He even suspected that Jiang Zhen was a general, which would explain why he could beat up Liu Heitou and why his handwriting was quite ugly.Zheng Yi lifted the top card in the pile, and there was the ugly word \u201cTiger\u201d on the card.\u201cI\u2019m from an ordinary farmer\u2019s family in Hexi Village. I haven\u2019t gone to school, but my two younger brothers have. I occasionally listened to them, and I am barely able to read,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Zheng Yi smiled and said, \u201cYour talent was deeply buried in a peasant household.\u201d When Jiang Zhen looked at him, he was neither humble not arrogant. He really didn\u2019t look like a person from an ordinary household.After a few pleasantries, the two of them got straight to the point and talked about the cards.\u201cThe four patterns you drew on them are somewhat plain. Do you think it would be better to change them into plum, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum?\u201d As soon as they started, Zheng Yi came up with this suggestion.\u201cIt\u2019s not elegant to let the four gentlemen appear in the gambling house. It would be troublesome to do. In my opinion, it would be better to use some simple patterns for the most common cards. But in addition to ordinary cards, you can also make more delicate cards for ladies. They can be painted with plum, orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum. Those two tiger cards can be changed into sun and moon cards. One would be painted with gold and black and the other would be painted with Chang\u2019e flying to the moon,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. The myths and legends of this place were almost the same as those of the ancient era he knew of\u2014Hou Yi shot to the sun and Chang\u2019e to the moon.Zheng Yi also thought that ordinary cards should be made rougher and not too delicate. He was reluctant to spoil those gamblers.\u201cOne more thing is that these cards are very easy to learn. When I release them, it can really attract the attention of the dignitaries. I\u2019m afraid it won\u2019t be long before it\u2019s all over the street, so it won\u2019t be easy to make money,\u201d Zheng Yi said.Their Zheng family could barely be regarded as a scholarly family, and they certainly couldn\u2019t be compared with those old families, that had no family business. It was also because of this that their house stayed in Hecheng County, specializing in doing business and getting support from the capital.In the same fashion, this would also conveniently open up a new door, so they could earn more. The advantage of making and presenting cards belonged mainly to the capital. Zheng Yi Was hoping to gain some benefits.\u201cWhat businesses does Master Zheng have under him?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked. \u201cMaster Zheng, it would be better to design a logo for these businesses. In the future, both the shops and the caravans will use this logo, and the back of the cards should also be painted with this logo.\u201dAt first, when Zheng Yi heard Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, he was puzzled. But after some thought, he couldn\u2019t help but applaud. This way, those who were the first to come in contact with the cards would recognize their cards by the logo, not to mention their business name would also become widely known.This Jiang Zhen unexpectedly opened his mouth and was able to come up with such an idea! However, many of the shops under his name had different names, and it was not easy to unify them. He would need to carefully consider it.\u201cThese cards can also be given away when we have enough reserves,\u201d Jiang Zhen spoke again. In fact, he was not good at doing business, but this was common knowledge for modern people, and it was impossible for him not to know it.\u201cThen how can we keep the secret?\u201d Zheng Yi asked again. He actually had a way to keep the secret, but he still wanted to ask for Jiang Zhen\u2019s opinion.\u201cEach card can be made separately,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. For the moment, the traffic was inconvenient. They just needed to find more printing workshops to make them. Who would make the connection between those cards? \u201cIt can also be said it would be used for business.\u201dJiang Zhen and Zheng Yi talked happily with each other.At first, Zheng Yi asked Jiang Zhen to be the manager of the gambling house because he was grateful to Jiang Zhen, and he didn\u2019t expect him to do anything, but now . . .\u201cIs Brother Jiang interested in managing a gambling house?\u201d Zheng Yi asked, thinking that it might give an unexpected surprise to let Jiang Zhen manage a gambling house.\u201cIs Mr. Zheng interested in opening another gambling house?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.Zheng Yi immediately hesitated. The county town was only so big. If he opened another gambling house wouldn\u2019t it be competing with his own business?\u201cThis gambling house wouldn\u2019t deal with the poor, but only with the rich. For example, the cards of plum orchid, bamboo, and chrysanthemum can be used,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Jiang Zhen felt that it was meaningless to take hard-earned money from a group of ordinary people, so he might as well open a gambling shop only for the rich. Jiang Zhen had seen those big casinos before, so he thought about them and mentioned some of it.Zheng Yi immediately clapped his hands. \u201cGood idea!\u201dFor the poor, several copper pennies were already very valuable, but for the rich, it was different. They were used to spending hundreds of thousands of silver just to buy an antique without even blinking.There were many rich people to the south of Yangtze River . . . Although Hecheng County was small, there were also many rich people here, and traveling merchants didn\u2019t lack money. As for why there were so many rich people but the county town was not very prosperous . . . Nowadays, people liked to raise their own people to do everything.The cooks in the Zheng family\u2019s mansion were much better than those working in the restaurant. There were also people in their mansion who specialized in sewing. When they wanted to buy cloth, they would not go to the shop personally but send someone to make a delivery to their house.Not to mention that . . . some rich people even lived in the countryside.Hundreds of years ago, an old man came here after ending his career in court. After returning home, he set up a big house in the nearby countryside to be his ancestral home. That house was magnificent. Compared to it, the Zheng family\u2019s mansion was really small.\u201cI would build another gambling shop. No, it can\u2019t be called a gambling shop. We have to come up with a better name. This time, you\u2019ll be in charge of it, and you\u2019ll get 30 percent of the profit,\u201d Zheng Yi said.What he said was extremely generous because it was nothing to him and because he had made up his mind to go to the capital and build a big gambling house similar to what they would build in Hecheng. This meant the gambling house in Hecheng County was just for Jiang Zhen.After they talked about it, Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge stayed with Zheng Yi for dinner.During their talk before, Zhao Jinge hadn\u2019t spoken a word, so Zheng Yi didn\u2019t notice him until then and asked, \u201cWho is this?\u201d\u201cHe is my wife,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Zheng Yi was somewhat surprised. Gers could also marry and have children, but many large families who had only a few people in their families would raise them as men. After that, they may not be able to marry a well-matched woman, but as long as they were willing to spend money and marry a woman whose situation was not as good as their own, there would be no problem.Because of this, Zheng Yi had seen gers who could stand on their own feet, but those gers were married to women. He had never seen a married ger walk around. What kind of man would want his wife to appear in public? And . . . the appearance of this ger was really ordinary.Although he thought so in his heart, Zheng Yi never showed anything on his face. He liked making fun of people, but he also knew when to behave. In any case, he would never comment on other people\u2019s gers.Even though Zheng Yi was very calm, Zhao Jinge was still very uneasy. While eating, he didn\u2019t dare to move his chopsticks and was very restrained. Zheng Yi pretended to not see it when Jiang Zhen picked up food for Zhao Jinge from time to time, which made Zhao Jinge calm down slowly.The food in the Zheng mansion was very delicious. Jiang Zhen had never eaten such delicious food since he traveled to this ancient era, which had a lot to do with the fact that the cooks of the Zheng family were willing to use various raw materials when cooking.Just this fish . . .In Hexi, people ate mostly steamed or boiled fish, but this . . . There was a fish dish fried in oil. After cutting the fish with a knife, they also boiled it in sugar and vinegar. In the Zhao family, it was impossible for Zhao Liu to cook like this.Zhao Jinge liked the sour and sweet fish very much, so Jiang Zhen gave him some more. Zhao Jinge was very happy, and when Jiang Zhen looked at him, Zhao Jinge smiled at him.That smile was actually very restrained, but when Jiang Zhen saw it, he thought it was very good-looking.After dinner, Young Master Zheng suggested taking Jiang Zhen to the gambling house to have a look. Jiang Zhen originally wanted to take advantage of Young Master Zheng\u2019s power, so, of course, he would not refuse him.The gambling shop of the Zheng family was called Hongxing Gambling Shop. It was very big and had two floors in total with a yard at the back. Most of the guests entered through the gate, but Zheng Yi took them through the side door and went directly in the courtyard behind the gambling shop. At this moment, there were seven or eight thugs lazing around.Seeing Zheng Yi, these people immediately stood up and bowed down to him. \u201cMaster Zheng!\u201dLiu Heitou was standing in the middle of these thugs. When he saw Zheng Yi and Jiang Zhen next to each other, his whole face distorted. The cut made by Jiang Zhen on his face, coupled with his twisted expression, made his whole face look terrible and pitiful.\u201cFrom now on, the person in charge of you is Jiang Zhen,\u201d Zheng Yi said lightly at this moment.Not only Liu Heitou\u2019s hair was black, but his face was black too.Zheng Yi didn\u2019t like to stay in the gambling house for a long time, so he soon left. As soon as he left, Jiang Zhen looked at the thugs with a smile.\u201cI heard that someone set up a private gambling house outside under the name of our Hongxing Gambling House. I\u2019m going to have a look today. Do you want to come with me?\u201dWhen Jiang Zhen said this, he looked at Liu Heitou, which made Liu Heitou\u2019s face turn even darker. It was clear to Liu Heitou that Jiang Zhen was talking about him.He started his career as a thug in this gambling shop, but later, he privately gathered a group of people who did not belong to Hongxing Gambling House. Not only that, in order to support these people, he also secretly opened a gambling house in Qiaotou Village, which belonged to him.The Zheng family wanted fame and were not short of money, so this Hongxing Gambling House didn\u2019t deliberately induce others to owe debts. They also weren\u2019t in the business of lending money for exorbitant interests. Anyway, even though they didn\u2019t do such things, they already made a lot of money. But Liu Heitou\u2019s gambling house was different. They would lend people usuriously; set people up; and even sometimes when they knew there was not much money in the family, they would force the children of that gambler\u2019s family.\u201cManager Jiang, what do you mean?\u201d A man who was at odds with Liu Heitou came forward.\u201cI heard people say that someone was fooling around in Qiaotou Village under the name of our gambling house,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cJiang Zhen, don\u2019t try deceiving people too much!\u201d Liu Heitou couldn\u2019t help saying.\u201cIf you think I am deceiving people too much, you can leave right away. You will no longer be a person of Hongxing Gambling House. You won\u2019t play under the signboard of Hongxing Casino. No matter what you do outside, no one would care about you.\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at Liu Heitou with a smile.Liu Heitou didn\u2019t dare to leave. He didn\u2019t have any background, but over the years, he had been bullying people and done a lot of evil things. If he were to leave now, the people around him would disperse. Wouldn\u2019t it be easier for Jiang Zhen to get him into trouble then?He didn\u2019t dare to leave Hongxing Gambling House, so he could only watch as Jiang Zhen gathered all the thugs of the gambling house, including him, and went straight to his lair. This Jiang Zhen really wanted to make it. How was he going to live in Qiaotou Village in the future?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Gradually, there was less and less land in Qiaotou Village, but there were more and more people, so people\u2019s lives became more difficult. However, as a result, many people started looking for another way out. In Qiaotou, many young men and women went to work in the county town in order to earn money. And since Liu Heitou\u2019s promotion, many people followed him.These people who followed Liu Heitou said they were working for Hongxing Gambling House, but Hongxing Gambling House only needed a dozen goons, so how could they make use of so many people? In fact, they were working for Liu Heitou, making Liu Heitou act more and more recklessly. However, Liu Heitou was not stupid. He never extended his hand to the county town and did not go out to offend those who he couldn\u2019t afford to offend.In Qiaotou, Liu Heitou was basically the local emperor, so when Jiang Zhen brought him and more than a dozen other people to Qiaotou, Liu Heitou\u2019s men met them immediately.\u201cBig Brother!\u201d Among the people who took the lead to come was Liu Heitou\u2019s cousin. When he saw Liu Heitou, he shouted and then looked at Jiang Zhen warily.He knew Jiang Zhen. Originally, he and Liu Heitou went to kidnap He Qiusheng, but he was beaten by Jiang Zhen. It was just . . . why was this man standing together with their eldest brother today?\u201cWhere is the gambling house?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked one of the goons of the gambling house around him.That gambling house thug was a person under Liu Heitou, yet he was not only Liu Heitou\u2019s subordinate, but even more importantly, someone from the gambling house.He opened his mouth and weighed everything before he finally pointed in a certain direction and said, \u201cThat way.\u201d\u201cGo!\u201d Jiang Zhen took the people to where he pointed straight away.Liu Heitou had built a big house on that side of Qiaotou, so the people from the nearby village had a place to gamble. It was very different from Hongxing Gambling House and looked messy, but some people still liked going there.Hongxing Gambling House was opened in the county town. Even if it was open to ordinary people, many farmers were afraid to come in looking at the tall door. But Liu Heitou\u2019s gambling house was different; even if they were dressed in rags, everyone boldly went in.It was afternoon, and it was also the busiest time for Liu Heitou\u2019s gambling house. Many people with copper coins in their hands went there to lose all their money and feel comfortable.After taking a glance at the gambling shop, Jiang Zhen, who took some people with him, rushed in straight away.\u201cWhat do you want to do?\u201d Liu Heitou\u2019s brother, who had also brought people with him, stopped Jiang Zhen and asked angrily.\u201cLiu Heitou, what are your planning?\u201d Jiang Zhen looked at Liu Heitou with a smile.There were several reasons why he had brought them here today. One was because of the gambling house. He and Liu Heitou had a nasty fight before, and the people in the gambling house probably knew about it. At this moment, if he didn\u2019t say something, most of the people in the gambling house would look down on him, so he needed a way to show his authority. And the other reason was to take away these thugs from the gambling house.There were a total of nine thugs inside, of whom, three were from the county town. They had something to do with Manager Zhang and they didn\u2019t agree with Liu Heitou, the leader of the thugs. But the rest of them were on Liu Heitou\u2019s side.These people followed Liu Heitou\u2019s lead. It was not good for him to keep them, but it was also impossible to drive them all away. So he just brought all of them here to take down Liu Heitou\u2019s lair.Like Liu Heitou, these people wouldn\u2019t dare to offend the gambling house or leave it. Most of them would follow him, and when they helped him destroy Liu Heitou\u2019s lair, they would not be able to stand on Liu Heitou\u2019s side any longer. They had to follow him wholeheartedly because they would be afraid Liu Heitou would get even with them later.And there was also the other reason . . . of raising his reputation and letting people know that he was not easy to mess with. Jiang Zhen looked around at the people of Qiaotou Village, who were in awe of him and in a good mood.\u201cWho is that man? Why is Liu Heitou following him?\u201d\u201cHe brought people from Hongxing Gambling House, right? Those people listen to him!\u201d\u201cThis man seems to be Jiang Zhen! He is from the village of Hexi, the one the Liu family recently scolded at the entrance of the village every day.\u201d\u201cWhy did he come here? Isn\u2019t he afraid of Liu Heitou beating him?\u201d\u201cWhat would he be afraid of? Didn\u2019t you hear? Liu Heitou was beaten twice, both times by him.\u201d\u2026The people in Qiaotou were gossiping, looking at Jiang Zhen with gazes full of awe. This was the man who dared to beat Liu Heitou!Meanwhile, Jiang Zhen was still looking at Liu Heitou with a smile. \u201cLiu Heitou, what do you want?\u201dLiu Heitou\u2019s expression twisted again. Qiaotou was his territory. He would really like to call someone to kill Jiang Zhen. But he didn\u2019t dare. He really wanted to do that but unless he left his hometown to go outside, he wouldn\u2019t be able to live in Hecheng County. However, he was reluctant to leave everything here behind.\u201cJiang Zhen!\u201d Liu Heitou gritted his teeth and gave a shrill cry that was a bit fierce.Jiang Zhen glanced at Liu Heitou, then turned to the gambling house thugs behind him. \u201cGet rid of all the people who are gambling inside and take this place for me!\u201dLiu Heitou\u2019s brothers and the people he had raised were angry, and they waited for Liu Heitou to give them an order to teach Jiang Zhen a lesson, but Liu Heitou was silent. In the end, they unexpectedly watched as Jiang Zhen drove the gamblers out of the gambling house.The people were noisy at first, but as soon as they saw the situation outside, they immediately lowered their heads like quails.\u201cI\u2019m the manager of Hongxing Casino. Liu Heitou is a member of the casino. Setting up a private casino outside violates the rules of Hongxing Casino. From now on, this casino must be closed and can\u2019t be opened again,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.In fact, there was no such rule in Hongxing Gambling House. That was why, although Manager Zhang was a little dissatisfied with Liu Heitou making trouble outside, he didn\u2019t care too much. It was just that, these days the rules were made by the people above.Everyone in Qiaotou Village believed it.If the assistant of the cloth shop was doing cloth business outside, he would definitely be kicked out from the cloth Shop. It would be the same with Liu Heitou.Although Liu Hetou was still friendly to the villagers of Qiaotou Village, the villagers didn\u2019t like him. Now that he was unlucky, the vast majority of the villagers clapped their hands and felt very relieved. At the same time, there was growing awe for Jiang Zhen.Liu Heitou didn\u2019t even dare to fart in front of this man, and listened to him . . . Who the hell was he?Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t do anything. He let people bring him the account books and the silver from Liu Heitou\u2019s small gambling house, as he himself leaned against the door and looked at Liu Heitou with a smirk on his face. There was no ferocious expression on his face, but facing him, Liu Heitou could hardly stand it.Jiang Zhen had been watching Liu Heitou warily, but he knew that Liu Heitou would no longer resist. If Liu Heitou had been ten years younger, he would have resisted. If he had been so poor that he could not even afford to eat, he would have also resisted. But now, he had already changed. He was reluctant to give up his family business, so he could only helplessly watch others cut the meat from him.\u201cThe gambling house won\u2019t ask for the money. We\u2019ll split it later,\u201d Jiang Zhen said with a smile to the goons working outside.Originally, there were still some thugs who didn\u2019t work hard, but when they heard Jiang Zhen\u2019s words, they immediately felt like they had been injected with chicken blood.Liu Heitou\u2019s cousins looked at him with red eyes. \u201cBig Brother!\u201d This small gambling house was the result of their painstaking efforts!\u201cThat Jiang Zhen is valued by Master Zheng!\u201d Liu Heitou said as he clenched his teeth.The Liu family all knew Master Zheng. That was a person that even the county magistrate respected. If Jiang Zhen was valued by Young Master Zheng . . . they really couldn\u2019t do anything about Jiang Zhen.Although Liu Heitou persuaded his brother, his heart seemed to be dripping blood. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t play his cards according to common sense and did things against expectations. He suddenly brought people here today, so that he didn\u2019t have time to make any preparations, let alone hide anything. He had been working hard for a long time, but he might end up being cheated by Jiang Zhen!Jiang Zhen was staring at Liu Heitou while Zhao Jinge, who was standing beside him, didn\u2019t know what to do. He followed Jiang Zhen all the time, but he didn\u2019t understand what Jiang Zhen was doing. Up until now, he still had no idea what Jiang Zhen wanted to do. Those thugs were all moving things, and it was not appropriate for him to stand by. Zhao Jinge hesitated for a moment and then went to move stuff with those thugs and look for the silver.Growing up, Zhao Jinge had never done such a thing, and when he did it, he somewhat felt tangled. His face stiffened, which made him look like he was a little unhappy when he frowned because of the scar between his eyebrows.When those goons saw that Zhao Jinge had been following Jiang Zhen all the time and Jiang Zhen talked to him kindly, they thought that Zhao Jinge must be one of Jiang Zhen\u2019s men, so they wanted to improve their relationship with him.\u201cHey, Brother, who are you under Jiang Zhen?\u201d There was some humility in the question.\u201cYou and Jiang Zhen must be brothers, right? You are the same in height and wear the same clothes,\u201d someone else came over to ask.Zhao Jinge was silent. He was actually Jiang Zhen\u2019s wife whom he had just married. However, at this moment, he didn\u2019t think any of these people would believe him.No man had ever taken his newly wed wife to work in a gambling shop and to rob others . . . In fact, Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t understand what Jiang Zhen was thinking either. Jiang Zhen used to flirt with him and praise him for being good-looking. He was always happy to hear it, but now . . . Why did Jiang Zhen seem to see him as a man?\u201cBrother, what is Jiang Zhen like?\u201d these people who saw that Zhao Jinge was silent asked again.\u201cLike . . . He likes money?\u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cYeah, who doesn\u2019t like money?\u201d Those people were satisfied.\u201cBrother, if you can help put in a good word for us in the future, we will invite you to a drink next time! There are some pretty little sisters in Qingyang. We will go to them and tell them to sleep with you.\u201dZhao Jinge\u2019s whole body froze. \u201c. . .\u201d Didn\u2019t he look even a little bit like a ger? In any case, there were too many bad places in the county town. He had to keep an eye on Jiang Zhen. He couldn\u2019t let Jiang Zhen find someone else. After clenching his teeth, Zhao Jinge continued working.Jiang Zhen saw that Zhao Jinge was working, but it wasn\u2019t heavy physical work and it was much easier than Zhao Jinge\u2019s previous work, so he didn\u2019t stop him. Even if someone spoke to Zhao Jinge, he didn\u2019t take it seriously. He knew that Zhao Jinge was fond of him, and they were married. Zhao Jinge was merely speaking with someone. Why would he need to care?After a while, everything from Liu Heitou\u2019s gambling house was brought out. At first, Jiang Zhen thought that he might find some account books that could be used to threaten Liu Heitou or something. However, facts proved that he thought too much.How could a group of illiterate thugs write any kind of account book? Among them, there was only one person who could read, but he usually only wrote various debt notes. His characters looked even uglier than Jiang Zhen\u2019s. However, in addition to that, more than six hundred silver were found.Liu Heitou didn\u2019t like farming, so his biggest source of income was usually lending money to other people. This six hundred silver was the money he used to lend.Jiang Zhen looked at it and then gave those people who followed him to the gambling house, along with Zhao Jinge, fifty silver each. He then collected the rest of the money without hesitation himself and said to Liu Heitou, \u201cLiu Heitou, you can\u2019t continue opening this gambling house. Besides, it is a crime to lend money. You\u2019d better be obedient, otherwise . . . Young Master Zheng will definitely not let you go.\u201dLiu Heitou clenched his fist and looked at Jiang Zhen. He was already very angry.Meanwhile, Jiang Zhen was saying to the people around Liu Heitou, \u201cYou followed Liu Heitou in the name of Hongxing Gambling House but in fact, you are not from Hongxing Gambling House at all and no one will protect you in the future, but if you follow me . . . Young Master Zheng plans to open a new gambling house for me to manage, and I am short of people.\u201cJiang Zhen, this is going overboard. Coming to my place to poach my people! The angry Liu Heitou started looking around at the men he had gathered. Suddenly, he found that many of them were excited. As for the people from the gambling house . . . after they took the fifty silver Jiang Zhen gave them, they didn\u2019t look at him at all!The thugs from these gambling houses had a good income, but they were only selling their strength, it was already good to earn five or six silver a month. Now that Jiang Zhen gave them fifty silver at once, they would naturally want to listen to Jiang Zhen.Liu Heitou had made so much money. But he usually only bought them a drink, which was really stingy. Why had they been following him?Jiang Zhen closed the gambling house, but he didn\u2019t really do anything to Liu Heitou. Such a person couldn\u2019t be forced hastily.After saying a few more words to his recruits, Jiang Zhen saw that more and more of Liu Heitou\u2019s men had a change of heart. Seeing this, Jiang Zhen left with Zhao Jinge. On the way, he saw a familiar figure who was secretly running away, and shouted, \u201cLiu Dacheng, don\u2019t forget the money you owe me!\u201dThen Liu Dacheng ran even faster.Jiang Zhen gave his silver to Zhao Jinge. Zhao Jinge, who took the silver, immediately felt extremely hot. He had the feeling that everything happening was unreal.When the thugs of Hongxing Gambling House saw this, they increasingly felt that this silent man, who didn\u2019t like talking, should be very well-liked by Jiang Zhen. One of them went up to specially give Zhao Jinge the silver bracelet that was included in his share of fifty silver he received.\u201cBrother, don\u2019t forget what I told you! Next time I will invite you for a drink!\u201dZhao Jinge: \u201c. . .\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They are going to invite you for a drink,\u201d after walking for a while Jiang Zhen asked casually.Zhao Jinge\u2019s expression suddenly became extremely tangled when he heard these words.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Jiang Zhen, seeing that Zhao Jinge\u2019s expression was not quite right, got worried. Was there something else to it?\u201cThey\u2026. He said he would invite me to drink flower wine.\u201d Zhao Jinge said, somewhat uneasy that Jiang Zhen would become angry.Jiang Zhen noticed his mood, but he was not angry at all. Instead, he laughed as he grabbed Zhao Jinge.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen angrily. Jiang Zhen\u2019s reaction was different from what he expected.\u201cI just didn\u2019t expect it.\u201d Jiang Zhen chuckled. \u201cHow could they invite you to drink flower wine instead of inviting me?\u201d Zhao Jinge looked very serious, and was very old-fashioned. He didn\u2019t look like someone who would really drink flower wine.Zhao Jinge immediately looked at Jiang Zhen. Jiang Zhen wanted to drink flower wine?!\u201cWell, I won\u2019t go and neither will you. We already are a family,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. His eyes flickered slightly \u2013 those people even wanted to invite Zhao Jinge to drink flower wine\u2026. Ha-ha!\u201cUm.\u201d Zhao Jinge nodded. People with families should not drink flower wine!\u201cJiang Zhen, wasn\u2019t what you did today bad?\u201d after another couple of steps Zhao Jinge couldn\u2019t help asking. Was it really OK for Jiang Zhen to rob Liu Heitou like this?\u201cI have always been a man who returns the favor, and he always must pay the price of provoking me,\u201d Jiang Zhen said with a smile. He still had a good sense of how to do things. He would never let Liu Heitou jump the wall. The gambling house was really not a good thing and as for other things\u2026.Young Master Zheng and Manager Zhang hoped he would teach the restless Liu Heitou a lesson.Thinking that Liu Heitou had even come to make trouble when he was getting married to Jiang Zhen, Zhao Jinge thought that what they did today was nothing.However, when Jiang Zhen said \u201creturn the favor\u201d it made him feel a little uneasy.It was because of his kindness that Jiang Zhen was so good to him. If it had been someone else to save Jiang Zhen in the first place\u2026.However, this was also a good thing. Jiang Zhen would repay his kindness, and he would not abandon him suddenly.When he figured this out, Zhao Jinge smiled.\u201cJinge, is there anything you want?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.Zhao Jinge shook his head. He was not lacking anything now, so\u2026.Zhao Jinge looked at the small silver bracelet that the thug had put in his hand and felt his heart throb. He wanted a child now, a child from Jiang Zhen.If they had children, their family would not fall apart.\u201cThen let\u2019s get something to eat.\u201d Seeing Zhao Jinge shake his head, Jiang Zhen pondered for a moment and then knocked on the door of a family house they passed by.There were two newly grown up roosters in this family courtyard. Jiang Zhen bought one of them and carried it home.Since Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t want anything, he would buy something to eat.By the time Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge returned, Zhao Liu had already finished preparing dinner.\u201cMom, I\u2019ll clean up this rooster and we will add another dish in the evening,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Even if Jiang Zhen was rich now, he shouldn\u2019t be so extravagant. Zhao Liu hesitated a little. \u201cLet\u2019s leave it today, I have already prepared steamed eggs with bacon.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s cook it and celebrate!\u201d Jiang Zhen said. \u201cI\u2019ll get the knife.\u201dJiang Zhen went straight to get the knife and when Zhao Liu saw he couldn\u2019t be persuaded, she hurriedly went in the house to get a bowl. Chicken blood couldn\u2019t be wasted!Jiang Zhen could kill the chicken but Zhao Liu didn\u2019t want to let Jiang Zhen get involved in the business of plucking feathers and cleaning the internal organs of the chicken. Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t try to force it either. Knowing that Zhao Fugui and the others were still on the field, he went there planning to help them with the work and then call them for the meal.\u201cJinge, you should keep an eye on Jiang Zhen and not let him spend money recklessly,\u201d as soon as Jiang Zhen left, Zhao Liu said to Zhao Jinge. \u201cThe future is long. Now that we have spent all our money, what are we going to do in the future?\u201d\u201cMother\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Jinge took the bamboo basket he was carrying and showed Zhao Liu the silver inside.Zhao Liu covered her chest feeling like she could no longer breathe. \u201cThis\u2026 This\u2026 Another hundred silver?\u201d\u201cAbout two hundred,\u201d Zhao Jinge said.\u201cJiang Zhen gave us one hundred silver before, and this time he gave us two hundred silver. We can buy another 15 mu of paddy field and then our family will have 20 mu of paddy field. We will be even richer than the Jiang family!\u201d Zhao Liu said.\u201cUm.\u201d Zhao Jinge nodded.Zhao Liu used to think that it was too wasteful to buy a chicken to eat, but now\u2026.She quickly dealt with the chicken.People in Hexi basically filled an iron pot with water to cook the chicken, and when the chicken was cooked, they would take it out and cut it into pieces to eat. They were also reluctant to throw away the water used to boil the chicken, so they basically collected it and used it for cooking. However, if the chicken was cooked like this, it would take at least half an hour. It was too slow, so Zhao Liu decided to cook the chicken in soy sauce.The whole chicken was cut into small pieces, and the chicken\u2019s belly was put in the pot to fry for a while. Then Zhao Liu boiled out the oil, turned the cut pieces of chicken and slightly stir-fried them, added soy sauce and water, and waited for it to cook slowly.When Jiang Zhen came back with Zhao Fugui, Zhao Liu had already finished preparing the chicken and had asked Zhao Jinge to bring a small bowl to Sun Xiaoshan.These days, Sun Xiaoshan went to catch either snails or fish every day. When he caught some, he brought them all to Zhao Liu, who was very grateful to him for it.In the evening, there was a large bowl of braised chicken on the table, a bowl of steamed eggs and bacon, as well as beans and fried garlic sprouts cooked with pickles.While talking about the chicken, ducks, and the vegetables she had planted at home, Zhao Liu gave Jiang Zhen a chicken leg.Jiang Zhen put the drumstick directly into her bowl, and gave Zhao Fugui the onother one.\u201cMom, Dad, you eat them.\u201dAs for Zhao Jinge, Jiang Zhen gave him two pieces of chicken breast. In modern times, except for those who wanted to lose weight, hardly anyone liked eating chicken breast, but in ancient times, chicken breast was a good thing. After all, it was a whole piece of meat. Of course, for Jiang Zhen, the taste of chicken wings was better when they had enough oil and water.Two chicken wings were almost gnawed clean by Jiang Zhen but one of chicken wing was given to Zhao Jinge. \u201cThis one tastes best. Try it.\u201dZhao Jinge ate the chicken wing with delight, while Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu slowly nibbled on the chicken legs.Zhao Liu was still fine. She had not been in the best of health, so in the past, when they killed a chicken as a sacrifice to their ancestors during the New Year Festival, Zhao Fugui and Zhao Jinge often left the chicken legs to her to eat. But Zhao Fugui, he hadn\u2019t eaten drumsticks in decades. He was a big man. How could he eat drumsticks? That was what Zhao Fugui thought, but there was a smile on his face.The next day, Zhao Liu started chatting to other people again.\u201cOur family\u2019s Jiang Zhen is really lavish. He bought a chicken on his way back and had to eat it on the same day. We ate almost the whole chicken in one sitting . . . Even so, he still had to give the chicken legs to me and my old man. We said we are already so old, so why should we eat chicken legs?\u201dThe people listening to Zhao Liu were \u201c. . .\u201d Who can afford to eat chicken legs these days? You are only showing off! This Zhao Liu talking like that was just too irritating!People grew even more envious of Zhao Liu. Then the news reached Hexi Village that Jiang Zhen of the Zhao family went so far as to take people to close down Liu Heitou\u2019s gambling house! Liu Heitou hadn\u2019t even dared to say a word!On the day of Jiang Zhen\u2019s marriage with Zhao Jinge, Liu Heitou went to the Zhao family\u2019s house to make trouble, which made many people in Hexi Village sympathize with the Zhao family, thinking that the Zhao family would meet bad luck sooner or later. As it turned out, Jiang Zhen could even shut down Liu Heitou\u2019s gambling house! How did Jiang Zhen suddenly become so powerful? He used to be a dullhead anyone could bully!\u201cI heard that Jiang Zhen also became a manager of the gambling house in the county town!\u201d\u201cI also heard that Liu Heitou\u2019s men are working for him now.\u201d\u201cEven more than that, even Liu Heitou himself has become his subordinate!\u201d\u201cI heard that they took a few hundred silver from Liu Heitou\u2019s gambling shop yesterday. A few hundred silver!\u201d\u201cNow that Jiang Zhen has money, the Zhao family are so lucky!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that they were talking about Jiang Zhen again, they regretted that they hadn\u2019t married their daughters or gers to Jiang Zhen in the first place.Old lady Jiang used to like listening to the neighborhood gossip, but at the moment, when she saw people gather together, she wanted to turn around and leave.\u201cFrom Butcher Jiang\u2019s house, from Butcher Jiang\u2019s house!\u201d Someone stopped old Madam Jiang.Old lady Jiang stopped with a cold look on her face, and then heard people saying, \u201cFrom Butcher Jiang\u2019s family, now everyone is saying that Jiang Zhen is a blessed man. Have you heard?\u201d\u201cHe is a star of evil. How can he become a blessed man!\u201d Old lady Jiang almost blew up.\u201cHe is indeed blessed. Think about it. When you were pregnant with him, Butcher Jiang got the chance to join the army. Later, he came back with a lot of money. After he came back, the life of your family got better day by day . . . But after he left your house . . . Tut-tut!\u201d The person paused at this point, but the meaning could not have been any clearer.Since Jiang Zhen left the Jiang family house, the life of the Jiang family had turned sadder and sadder. There were people quarreling in the family every day.\u201cNow that Jiang Zhen has gone to the Zhao family, he became part of the Zhao family. The Zhao family treats him well and his blessing is growing bigger and bigger. . . \u201d the man said again.Zhao Liu praised Jiang Zhen outside all day. At a single glance, everyone knew that she was very satisfied with Jiang Zhen. Not only that, Jiang Zhen was also very kind to them. This old lady Jiang . . . she used to scold Jiang Zhen all day, so she was also scolding all of Jiang Zhen\u2019s blessings.Old lady Jiang looked at the man\u2019s gloating eyes and was so angry that she left with a cold face and hurried home. As soon as she returned, she was scolded by the angry-looking Butcher Jiang.\u201cWhy are you running outside when there is still a lot of work at home?\u201d Butcher Jiang looked at old lady Jiang in dissatisfaction.The second son went out to do business, the third son went to work in the county town, and their two daughters-in-law couldn\u2019t be counted on. Butcher Jiang was very tired from his everyday work and became even more dissatisfied after seeing old lady Jiang.\u201cI\u2019m not running around! I was going to do the laundry!\u201d Old Madam Jiang was dissatisfied too. Where was she doing less work?The Jiang family members immediately started quarreling again.There was also another family that was noisy.Since he was tied up by his sons, Father He had been well-behaved for some time. He even helped Mother He with some of the work at home, which made her very happy. But after learning that Jiang Zhen had managed to close down Liu Heitou\u2019s gambling house and became the manager of Hongxing Gambling House, the wheels in Father He\u2019s head started moving.Jiang Zhen was so powerful. If his son could marry him . . .Although He Qiusheng was good-looking, the He family had always lived in a small village and had never seen much of the world, so they were already satisfied, as long as He Qiusheng could marry a slightly richer person. And wasn\u2019t Jiang Zhen a rich man now?\u201cQiusheng, what a good candidate Jiang Zhen is! You must hurry up!\u201d Father He persuaded repeatedly. \u201cEven if you become his concubine, as long as you can get his love, what is the difference between the first wife and the concubine? Zhao Jinge is not only ugly but also old. I also heard that his cinnabar was dim in the past. I don\u2019t know if he can even give birth to a child. If you give birth to a son to Jiang Zhen . . .\u201d\u201cDad! Stop it!\u201d He Qiusheng was angry and annoyed.\u201cWhy are you so mean to me? I\u2019m doing it for you. I like Jiang Zhen. He can provide you with several hundred silver!\u201d Father He said. Jiang Zhen had become the manager of Hongxing Gambling House. If he could become Jiang Zhen\u2019s father-in-law . . .\u201cDad, in Jiang Zhen\u2019s heart, there is only Zhao Jinge. If you talk nonsense again, I will tie you up again!\u201dWhen He Chunsheng came home to pick up his things, he heard what his father was talking about and was furious.Father He was silent, but the wheels in his head hidden behind his eyelids were still turning.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know what was happening in Hexi. He took Zhao Jinge to the county town early in the morning.Zheng Yi said that he would open a gambling house for Jiang Zhen to manage, but the gambling house was not yet in sight for now, and Jiang Zhen could only get involved in the original gambling house, so Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t have to do any work at the moment but was paid a manager\u2019s salary.After going around the gambling shop, he told Manager Zhang that there was something going on at home. He was afraid he would not be able to come over for some time.Manager Zhang was very eager for Jiang Zhen to stay away from the gambling house, so he was glad that something was going on in his family and sent Jiang Zhen away with a smile. Then Jiang Zhen took Zhao Jinge to the docks and bought all the chicken and ducks that were being sold.\u201cSo many chicks and ducklings, what are you going to do with them?\u201d Someone looked puzzled at Jiang Zhan. Jiang Zhen bought more than thirty ducklings and more than forty chicks. No one would raise so many chicks and ducklings, right? How much food did they want to eat?\u201cRaise them and sell for money,\u201d Jiang Zhen responded casually.\u201cHow can you sell so many chicken and ducks . . .\u201d The man looked at Jiang Zhen in bewilderment.Jiang Zen didn\u2019t say anything. But adding up to almost one hundred chicken and ducks, would there still be no room to sell them? It was just enough for a big family throwing a banquet.Rowing the boat, Jiang Zhen went home with a brood of chicks and ducklings.Those chicks and ducklings they had been raising before were all kept in the land that Jiang Zhen bought. They let them out in the fenced area during the day and locked them in the shed at night. These young chicken and ducks which were still too small were taken care of by Zhao Liu and Sun Xiaoshan.Jiang Zhen paid Wang Haisheng, Sun Xiaoshan, He Chunsheng, and He Xiasheng to help them do tasks around and taught the young men some skills every morning.Jiang Zhen basically gave these people all the work of rising the chicken and ducks, as well as the work in the field, while he himself took Zhao Jinge with him every day and started gathering Liu Heitou\u2019s former subordinates.In modern times, Jiang Zhen had a lot of pricks under his command, but they were all won over by him, so now, he was naturally not afraid of dealing with a group of thugs who couldn\u2019t even read a single word. The only thing he needed to pay attention to was weeding out those who had naturally bad characters and those who wouldn\u2019t fit in his team. Jiang Zhen did all of this for the sake of his own future, but his favorite thing to do at the moment was actually exercising at night.Although Zhao Jinge was shy, he was very obedient. He never refused any requests he made, which was simply too much to his liking. Of course, he had no special hobbies and would not make any excessive demands.\u201cJinge, let\u2019s clean up for today. Wait . . .\u201d After the meal, Jiang Zhen was thinking about their evening.\u201cOk . . . \u201d Zhao Jinge replied in a low voice and touched his stomach \u2013 he didn\u2019t know when he would have a baby . . .Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He caressed Zhao Jinge\u2019s body over and over again and then embraced Zhao Jinge, so that their bodies stuck to each other tightly.Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t refuse him at first, but after being cuddled for a while, he couldn\u2019t help pushing Jiang Zhen away. \u201cIt\u2019s too hot.\u201dNow that the weather was getting hotter and hotter, their mattress was also replaced by a straw mat. Under such circumstances, sleeping together was clearly a torment!\u201cJust get used to it . . .\u201d Jiang Zhen was actually also a little hot, but he just liked holding Zhao Jinge and really didn\u2019t want to let him go. The places where they touched were wet with sweat. Was that something one could get used to? It was just that Jiang Zhen had such a small request, wouldn\u2019t it be bad for him to decline it?Zhao Jinge was hesitating when Jiang Zhen suddenly pressed him down, kissing him fiercely for a while. Then he released him, saying, \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll leave you alone. Go to bed early.\u201dJiang Zhen wanted to be intimate with Zhao Jinge, but he also knew that should they continue cuddling, Zhao Jinge absolutely would not sleep well, so he gave up on that plan.These days, Zhao Jinge followed him outside every day, and he was tired.Jiang Zhen lay beside Zhao Jinge and didn\u2019t bother him anymore. Zhao Jinge felt much cooler now, but was somehow lost.Just then, Jiang Zhen suddenly reached out to take his hand. Zhao Jinge, even though his hand was sweaty, did not let it go either.These days, Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge went to bed early and got up early, but Zhao Liu and Zhao Fugui, who were older and already slept less, still got up earlier than they did.By the time they left the house, Zhao Liu was already cooking porridge, while Zhao Fugui was feeding the piglets and cleaning the pigsty. Just a few days ago, Zhao Fugui bought two piglets and planned to kill one for the Spring Festival and sell the other one.Raising pigs was dirty work, but Zhao Fugui handled it seriously and felt very satisfied. These were his own pigs; this was for his family! As long as he thought of it like this, Zhao Fugui was full of energy. Before, Jiang Zhen wanted him to find someone else to help, but Zhao Fugui disapproved.When older people had something to do, it made their bodies healthier. When Jiang Zhen thought of it this way, he no longer insisted on keeping Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu from working. He just brought some meat home every day to make them eat better.In modern times, Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu, who were in their fifties, should be careful about eating too much greasy food, but it was not necessary in this situation. Nowadays, the people here were reluctant to use animal fat in their fried dishes. The fat content of pork was considerably lower than that of pork in the modern era. As for the chicken and ducks . . . In modern times, many chicken and ducks had a layer of fat under their skin. The wife of Jiang Zhen\u2019s comrade, whether she ate chicken or duck, would peel the skin before cooking. Meanwhile, in this era, finding a piece of chicken fat in the chicken belly was already enough to make ancient people happy for a long time.It was just after dawn, and it was too early to go out. Jiang Zhen took out the sand table he had made himself and taught Zhao Jinge how to read.He read the scholarly book from that time and then found that many phrases had something like \u201cHeaven\u201d, \u201cEarth\u201d , \u201cYellow\u201d , and \u201cUniverse\u201d that he could neither understand nor explain, so he threw that book away and only taught Zhao Jinge numbers and arithmetic. In Jiang Zen\u2019s opinion, counting was just as important as recognizing words. Previously, he watched a scholar buy some things, and he simply could not count them.Zhao Jinge was older and couldn\u2019t learn as fast as a child, but he was more diligent than a child, so his speed of learning was not slow. However, after seven or eight days, he had only learned seventy or eighty simple words.\u201cHow do you write \u2018Jiang Zhen\u2019? \u201d Zhao Jinge asked suddenly.Jiang Zhen was stunned. He taught Zhao Jinge to read Chinese characters step by step because he did not know many traditional characters himself. He had to learn them himself before he could teach Zhao Jinge, so he forgot to teach Zhao Jinge to write their names.As a result, Zhao Jinge asked to learn how to write his name.Jiang Zhen smiled, took out a piece of white paper from the side and wrote \u201cJiang Zhen\u201d. He wrote it in regular script, as well as in simplified characters.It was only after Jiang Zhen had finished that he noticed that he had inadvertently made a mistake. He wanted to write it again, but after thinking about it for a while, he gave up on this plan.He planned to learn traditional Chinese characters, so Zhao Jinge could also learn traditional Chinese characters, but if it was just his name, it wouldn\u2019t matter if Zhao Jinge wrote it in simplified Chinese characters.\u201cJiang Zhen\u201d in simplified Chinese characters was only slightly different from the traditional Chinese characters.\u201cThis is my name.\u201d Jiang Zhen gave Zhao Jinge the paper in his hand, and then wrote it several times on the sand table to show it to Zhao Jinge.

Jiang Zhen was a bit hungry and thirsty, so he drank three bowls in one breath. Zhao Jinge\u2019s appetite was not any smaller than his, and he also drank three big bowls in one breath.After eating, Jiang Zhen let Wang Haisheng and the He brothers row the boat and took them and Zhao Jinge to Qiaotou. These days, Jiang Zhen basically lived in Qiaotou Village. He occupied Liu Heitou\u2019s gambling house and used it as a place to train his men.In addition to Wang Haisheng, He Chunsheng and He Xiasheng, Jiang Zhen now had a number of subordinates. Among them, there were some from the gambling house and those who once worked under Liu Heitou. Now that they had joined him, they all added up to more than thirty people. Even Liu Heitou himself was among them.At the beginning, Liu Heitou was reluctant to follow Jiang Zhen. He could not afford to lose face. However, after Jiang Zhen closed his gambling house that day, he beat him up again the next day and threatened him along the way.He wanted to find Manager Zhang to stand up for him, but Manager Zhang didn\u2019t care about it at all. In the end, he had no choice but to follow Jiang Zhen and become one of Jiang Zhen\u2019s subordinates.A few days ago, he was still a leader, but in the blink of an eye, he became a small soldier in the hands of others. One could easily imagine how frustrated Liu Heitou was. However, Jiang Zhen was always watching him and had to deal with him from time to time . . .Seeing Jiang Zhen taking people to Qiaotou from afar, Liu Heitou\u2019s face darkened again.Jiang Zhen started training his men again.At the beginning, he drew a big pie chart for those who would follow him and laid down some rules for them before he started training them, standing in a military posture and walking in a square formation in the morning. At noon, he carried out ideological education, and in the afternoon, they did physical exercises.Jiang Zhen had to admit that these people were the hardest people he had ever trained. In modern kindergartens, children already knew how to line up, but people here didn\u2019t. They couldn\u2019t even tell the difference between left and right. At the same time, Jiang Zhen asked them to do some boring exercises, and these unskilled thugs refused.But it didn\u2019t stop him from doing it. These people were just people who had no rules or discipline and had never trained. Jiang Zhen felt that if he was in danger in the future, these people would run away in droves!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He listened to Jiang Zhen well, and at night, Jiang Zhen occasionally even asked him to take off his clothes and stand in the army posture. Naturally, he learned very well. Next was Wang Haisheng and the He brothers, as well as the two men from Qiaotou. As for the rest of the people, their learning was sloppy, and some were particularly resistant.\u201cFuck it! I quit! Jiang Zhen, you are deliberately tormenting me, right? What on earth do you want me to learn from all this?\u201d Liu Heitou, who was tossed around by Jiang Zhen, got angry again, swearing while looking warily at Jiang Zhen. If nothing unexpected happened, Jiang Zhen would go up and beat him!Jiang Zhen did beat him. He had been fighting with Liu Heitou a lot. Jiang Zhen had figured out Liu Heitou\u2019s style, but Liu Heitou hadn\u2019t figured out his, so Jiang Zhen could defeat him more and more easily. No, it didn\u2019t take long for him to trounce Liu Heitou again, who was beaten up black and blue, his nose bruised.\u201cLiu Heitou, are you sure you don\u2019t want to learn anymore and leave?\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled narrowly at Liu Heitou, whose face was again swollen from the pinches.Liu Heitou immediately fell silent and obediently returned to the group. At the same time, all the people who participated in the training felt refreshed and did not dare to be lazy anymore.Jiang Zhen was very satisfied with this situation, which had become a normal thing for this group these days. In fact, he was very grateful to Liu Heitou. Every time Liu Heitou came up to provoke him or urged his men to provoke him, he could trounce them and make them more and more obedient . . .What should you do with the disobedient soldiers in the barracks? Of course, just beat them and make them listen! As for the provocative instructor, it was really nothing in Jiang Zhen\u2019s opinion. He used to be dissatisfied with his instructors and wanted to beat them . . . At that time, he was not as strong as he was now, and each time, the consequences were the same as those for Liu Heitou now. But even if he knew he couldn\u2019t beat up the instructor, he still wanted to provoke him. Liu Heitou probably felt the same.After beating Liu Heitou, Jiang Zhen continued the training refreshed and didn\u2019t return to Hexi until the evening.In the blink of an eye, another half a month passed. Jiang Zhen encountered a lot of trouble in the early days of teaching these people, but as time passed, they became more and more obedient. Under Jiang Zhen\u2019s special guidance there were ideas such as \u201cWhat Jiang Zhen said is reasonable\u201d, \u201cJiang Zhen is really strong\u201d, and \u201cThey are all adult men and will make a career in the future\u201d coming from these thugs. Thus, they trusted Jiang Zhen more and more. In this era most people were living in ignorance.When reading historical books, some people in modern times got confused, wondering why ancient people did not resist after experiencing all kinds of injustice. They could not understand why a soldier could control dozens of people who were doing corv\u00e9e, and those people didn\u2019t dare to say a word even when they were beaten, scolded, or whipped.Jiang Zhen had doubts before, but in this era, he understood the reason. In fact, at present , most people lived in ignorance. It was like when a group of zebras were attacked by lions, and a lion took one of them. After the initial confusion, the zebras relaxed again and continued to eat grass and run around. They felt that this was their lot in life, and naturally, it couldn\u2019t be changed by the death of one of their kind.It was the same with the people in this era. The vast majority of common people had never read a book, and their lives only revolved around their neighborhood. Their lives consisted of farming, eating, and having children, and then letting their sons continue farming, eating, and having children.In the beginning, the fact that the Jiang family was able to prosper had a lot to do with Butcher Jiang going away to join the army. Now, these people under Jiang Zhen\u2019s command were all ignorant. Before, they never thought about what they could do or achieve. They just wanted to accompany Liu Heitou in eating and drinking and make enough money to afford a bride and buy some land. But now, Jiang Zhen instilled some other ideas in them.They were men who could go out and do something big instead of staying in such a small place and doing things like bullying their neighbors. As long as they had perseverance, one day, they might be able to return home riding a big horse and going to a restaurant for dinner, which would impress people. This world was by no means limited to just the small area of Hecheng County. In fact, it was very, very large and boundless.With the passage of time, those who were very resistant to training at the beginning gradually started working hard. When they no longer had the mentality to resist, the effect of their training also became evident.In this era, common people lived a hard life, and they were able to bear the hardships. As long as Jiang Zhen gave them meat every day, they were not afraid of suffering or fatigue. Of course, for Liu Heitou it was not rare to eat meat, but he was still afraid of Jiang Zhen. He was afraid of Jiang Zhen, but also unable to defeat Jiang Zhen, and now his own men had become Jiang Zhen\u2019s men . . . Liu Heitou settled down peacefully; he could only speak ill of Jiang Zhen in private.However, now that everyone was extremely tired from their training, how many people were willing to listen to him toss and turn and say bad things about Jiang Zhen?That day, after the morning training was over, all of them ran to the mess hall. The two people hired by Jiang Zhen had already prepared the meal. It was pork and pickles soup with steamed eggplant and stir-fried amaranth. In the past, they used to rush to grab their meals, but since then Jiang Zhen had established the rule that no matter what they did, they had to line up and follow the rules. Therefore, everyone took two bowls, one for rice and another one for the other dishes, in an orderly fashion.Each person had a scoop of pork and pickled vegetable soup. In each scoop, there was a piece of pork the size of two fingers. As for the steamed eggplant and the fried amaranth, there was also one scoop per person. That was what these people ate, and Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge too.Letting someone pour the pickled pork soup over the rice, the other two dishes were put in the bowl. Jiang Zhen took the bowls and together with Zhao Jinge found a table to sit down and eat. This place used to be a gambling house, so naturally, there were many tables. But now these gambling tables had become dining tables.After sitting down, Jiang Zhen ate quickly. After a while, he had eaten all his food, and then watched Zhao Jinge eat with a smile.Zhao Jinge liked saving the most delicious food for last. After eating all the rice and the stir fry, he put the meat into his mouth and tasted it slowly.\u201cOne day, my Jinge will be able to eat whatever he wants.\u201d Jiang Zhen touched Zhao Jinge\u2019s head.Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen puzzled. In his opinion, his life now was already too good to be true. If he could eat whatever he wanted, wouldn\u2019t he just want to eat more meat? And . . . he thought that if they went on like this, they would become poor.\u201cJiang Zhen, is it really alright to spend money like this? Do you still have money?\u201dAlthough Jiang Zhen wasn\u2019t paying his men for now, even if they only had lunch at noon, he had already spent a lot of money in the past half a month. In the future, they would still need to give them money to support their families; otherwise, why should they follow Jiang Zhen?\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. It won\u2019t be long before I can make money,\u201d Jiang Zhen said with a smile.The people under his command had become obedient. With such a group of people, would he still need to worry about not making money?No one knew when the gambling house promised by Zheng Yi would open, but Jiang Zhen had already figured out another way to make money.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Liu Heitou asked them to do things and let them make money for themselves, but it was not good for them and if it was good, he would only give it to his cousins and not to them. He was always acting superior.Jiang Zhen was different. These days, Jiang Zhen ate the same food as them and was training with them. Even Zhao Jinge was training with them. That made them feel valued and felt less and less reluctant to train.\u201cAt first, I didn\u2019t realize that Zhao Jinge was a ger. In the beginning, I wanted to invite him to drink flower wine . . . \u201d a thug of the gambling house couldn\u2019t help saying.As a matter of fact, Hongxing Gambling House usually didn\u2019t need that many thugs, as long as someone was there to maintain order. After Jiang Zhen asked those people to follow him, he left five thugs who he didn\u2019t want to follow him to watch over the gambling house and then put the rest of them under his command.The man who once wanted to invite Zhao Jinge to drink flower wine was Ding Lian, one of the people he had gotten under his command. It was only after two days of training with Jiang Zhen that he learned from Liu Heitou that Zhao Jinge was Jiang Zhen\u2019s ger. When he first heard about it, he thought that Liu Heitou was trying to deceive him and didn\u2019t believe it at all. After all, Zhao Jinge really did not look like a ger at all. However, the people in Qiaotou Village all knew that Zhao Jinge was Jiang Zhen\u2019s ger. Some of them had gone to the Zhao family house to make trouble on the day Jiang Zhen got married, and some had even seen them wed with their own eyes.\u201cNot only you didn\u2019t see it, I didn\u2019t expect it either,\u201d someone said with humility.\u201cWho could have thought he was a ger? He is taller than me!\u201d\u201cBy the way, he is a ger. Why did Jiang Zhen let him train with us?\u201d\u201cBoss Jiang . . . is all about treating him as a man . . .\u201dThe people were all somewhat speechless, and they were even more sympathetic towards Zhao Jinge. He was obviously a ger, but he was brought to train every day by his husband. This was not a normal life for a ger at all. Jiang Zhen was so rich. Shouldn\u2019t his ger, just like Liu Heitou\u2019s wife, only look after the children at home every day and oversee the women hired by their family to do the work?Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t find it hard. This kind of training was nothing to him. It even made him feel closer to Jiang Zhen. He wanted to learn more, so that he could help Jiang Zhen in the future.After the meal, Jiang Zhen called those people to gather and began his brainwashing education. He used to take a lot of political classes, and although he hadn\u2019t listened carefully, it was still enough to instill some ideas into these people.Jiang Zhen had no patience for long speeches, so he only spoke for a bit, encouraging these people, and then asked them to have a lunch break. After an hour, it was time for the physical training. It was only after fighting these people that Jiang Zhen realized that their physical strength and endurance were really average.Near the forest of Qiaotou, more than thirty people had bamboo poles in their hands, and they were swinging them, repeating the movements of their hands over and over again, swinging the poles without stopping.Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t teach these people too many skills; he only wanted to improve their coordination and physical fitness, but it was different for Zhao Jinge. He let Wang Haisheng take these people to do some repetitive training while Jiang Zhen taught Zhao Jinge his fighting skills.Zhao Jinge\u2019s body was softer than Jiang Zhen\u2019s. In Jiang Zhen\u2019s opinion, it would be very suitable for Zhao Jinge to learn combat skills, so he taught him very attentively. He hoped that Zhao Jinge would have the ability to protect himself.Fighting skills, of course, couldn\u2019t be just learned by talking about it. Actual combat was required. Jiang Zhen tried to hold back his strength, but in other people\u2019s eyes . . . Jiang Zhen was beating his own ger!Their boss liked to train people, even his own wife couldn\u2019t be let go. If one thought about it carefully, only a ger like Zhao Jinge could bear it. . .When Jiang Zhen\u2019s men saw this scene, they sighed one after another. During their break, Ding Lian went to Zhao Jinge and whispered, \u201cHey, are you alright?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. Although Jiang Zhen\u2019s strikes fell on his shoulders several times, he held back his strength. It didn\u2019t hurt at all and he didn\u2019t fall to the ground. It was just . . . Jiang Zhen would unexpectedly pinch his ass whenever he fell on him. He didn\u2019t know if the others had seen it . . . As soon as Zhao Jinge thought that someone might have seen such a scene, his face felt very hot.\u201cI\u2019m glad you are alright.\u201d Ding Lian looked at Zhao Jinge sympathetically.Jiang Zhen did not know that his men felt sympathy for his wife. He was currently revising the punishment and reward measures. Those who did not do well would be punished, and those who did well would be rewarded. This was stipulated at the beginning of the training by Jiang Zhen. But these days, the punishment was basically just running and frog jumping and similar things, and the reward was money or food. However, the content of each stage of training was different, so naturally, these measures had to be slightly changed too . . .When he saw Jiang Zhen writing, Zhao Jinge took a branch and also wrote on the ground. He didn\u2019t write anything else except for Jiang Zhen\u2019s name, and then he wrote his own name. Looking at their names next to each other, he felt satisfied.That evening, Jiang Zhen disbanded these people very early. Before they left, he gave each of them a bunch of copper coins and clothes according to their performance.The clothes were made from the most common coarse fabric, but the style was slightly different from common clothes. These clothes were provided by Jiang Zhen, who had asked Zhao Liu to find a woman from Hexi to make them these days.\u201cAre these clothes?\u201d Ding Lian looked at the clothes with surprise.In fact, they were not short of clothes, but even so, Jiang Zhen giving them clothes made them somewhat excited, especially those like Ding Lian.Ding Lian became a thug because there was no one in his family. Although in the past he earned a lot of silver every month, no one advised him, so he always spent his money carelessly. His clothes and other things, because no one cared, were always dirty and worn till they turned into rags . . . When he suddenly got a new set of clothes with fine stitches, Ding Lian felt somewhat homesick.Of course, there were also those who were not satisfied with these clothes, such as Liu Heitou. But being beaten by Jiang Zhen for such a long time, even if he was not happy about it and dissatisfied, he did not dare to protest.\u201cYou should all wear these clothes tomorrow and come here early.\u201d Jiang Zhen handed out the clothes before going home.The next day, he was taking these people to the county town.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

For example, a letter would take more than a month before it was delivered to its recipient.After Zheng Yi got the cards, he was bent on making it big, but he couldn\u2019t prepare that quickly. Half a month had passed, and although many of the lowest grade cards had been printed, the higher grade cards couldn\u2019t be printed and needed to be painted individually. The drawing needed to be exquisite, so the speed was slow.Under such circumstances, Zheng Yi couldn\u2019t open the gambling house that he had promised to Jiang Zhen, and he couldn\u2019t let the gambling house be opened in advance, so he simply asked Manager Zhang to send fifty silver to Jiang Zhen and let Jiang Zhen take it easy and wait for a bit longer. He already knew that Jiang Zhen was training people and was eager to do something.Jiang Zhen accepted the fifty silver, but he didn\u2019t intend to wait while doing nothing. Instead, he asked Manager Zhang if he had a big boat he could rent.In the south of the Yangtze River, goods were transported by ships. The Zheng family had dozens of ships, large and small. Some of these ships were currently in use, but some were available. After Manager Zhang asked around, he rented a large ship to Jiang Zhen.When Jiang Zhen rented the ship, he contacted Yang Jing and asked him to help him contact some merchants who needed their goods to be transported. Jiang Zhen\u2019s way of making money was nothing else but logistics.Nowadays, businessmen did business on their own, each doing their own transport, and occasionally, they would share ships with others merchants, but for safety reasons and in order to avoid being killed, only businessmen who were very close to each other would do so. In this way, it inevitably led to wasted resources and increased costs.But since Jiang Zhen had rented the big ship, merchants could bring their goods on board of his ship, as long as they paid a small fee . . .As soon as Yang Jing mentioned it, many businessmen were interested. However, they had to wait until they met Jiang Zhen before making their decision.Jiang Zhen went down to Hecheng county town in order to meet the merchants contacted by Yang Jing. Jiang Zhen had rented a courtyard near Hecheng county town where he would meet the merchants.Before the appointed time, the businessmen of Hecheng county town went there one after another. The owner of the porcelain shop, who had done business with Jiang Zhen before, wanted to go out of town to buy a batch of porcelain this time. It was easy to encounter danger if he went there by a hired boat, so as soon as he heard Yang Jing\u2019s words, he was immediately tempted and arrived early.As soon as he arrived, he saw a lot of familiar faces. There were also some shop owners among them. One who was familiar with him was a silk trader named Li Mingzhe. All the people around Hecheng county grew mulberry and raised silkworms. This man bought cocoons and sold them every year. He also sold cloth woven by gers and women. Although he never opened a shop, he was very rich.\u201cBrother Li, you are also here?\u201d When the owner of the porcelain shop saw him, he immediately greeted him with a smile.\u201cBoss Zhou, long time no see.\u201d Li Mingzhe greeted the owner of the porcelain shop with a smile.\u201cI heard that Brother Li is going to have another addition to his family. Congratulations.\u201d\u201cTogether we rejoice.\u201d Li Mingzhe couldn\u2019t help smiling at the thought that he was going to have another child.The two men exchanged pleasantries, and Li Mingzhe inquired about Jiang Zhen from the owner of the porcelain shop.He had boats on his hands, but they all had boats. It was very troublesome to send deliveries, not only because of the boats but also because they had to select trustworthy people. So when he heard that someone could deliver the goods on his behalf this time, he immediately came to have a look.The owner of the porcelain shop had always been living in the county town, and he knew a thing or two about Jiang Zhen, so he immediately told Li Mingzhe what he knew. For example, Jiang Zhen was working for the Zheng family\u2019s young master now, he was a fierce fighter, and he had collected a number of people under his command.When Li Mingzhe heard this, he immediately felt that, if the price was right, he would let Jiang Zhen deliver the goods for him.At this time, other merchants had also gathered around the owner of the porcelain shop to listen to him. Among these people, many were already excited. Of course, they still had to see Jiang Zhen and check his qualifications before making a decision.\u201cThey are coming,\u201d said Yang Jing, who had also come to wait early, so at the moment he saw Jiang Zhen and the others coming over, he immediately told the others.Jiang Zhen had made a promise to him that he would get a commission from this business deal, meaning he would get five silver for every one hundred silver of business earned . . . Under such circumstances, he was very active in promoting this business.When the merchants heard Yang Jing\u2019s words, they looked over and saw a group of people coming from afar. These people were all tanned and thin, dressed in uniforms, looking very energetic, but what attracted them the most was the neatness of their movements! Each of them was only carrying a bamboo pole in his hands, but they all looked more imposing than the yamen officers who occasionally went out together on the streets of the county town, wearing swords. Although they had never seen them fight, at a single glance at them, these merchants knew that these people were definitely good at fighting!If they encountered such a group of bandits when they went out to do business, they could only immediately beg for mercy, but if these people had come to protect them . . . What bandits would dare to come to steal their goods?When those businessmen saw such a group of people, they had already made a decision in their hearts. Then Jiang Zhen also reassured them.\u201cThese people under my command are all local people from Hecheng county. They all have families in Hecheng county, so it is impossible for them to leave everything behind and run away. I can guarantee that your people will arrive at their destination safely.\u201dJiang Zhen didn\u2019t beat around the bush either. He spoke directly to the businessmen and then came up with a contract.\u201cBy the way, this is the contract I have drawn up. You can take a look at it,\u201d Jiang Zhen said again.Jiang Zhen\u2019s contract was very detailed, it also stated that if there were any accidents on the way, he would give them a certain amount as compensation. Of course, if there was an accident caused by a natural disaster, the compensation would be lost. If these merchants caused their own troubles, they would have to ask for compensation from those who had caused the troubles.These days, it was not uncommon for merchants to hire people to protect them; it was also not uncommon for these people to run away when they were in danger. So it was not uncommon for merchants to die or lose their goods, to the extent that small merchants could only think of themselves as unlucky. So seeing Jiang Zhen claim that he would give compensation should they encounter bandits who would seize their goods, the merchants were both shocked and delighted and couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201cThis contract, I\u2019m signing it!\u201d Li Mingzhe immediately said, and asked, \u201cRegarding the delivery of goods, can I not go?\u201d\u201cOf course. You can send someone to follow us. If you trust me enough to pay the handling fee over there, I will help you deliver your goods,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.\u201cGood!\u201d Li Mingzhe was very satisfied. He himself did not like running outside. After all, there would always be some element of danger outside. Now that he didn\u2019t need to go, it was better for him than ever.Li Mingzhe was the first one to decide to sign, so Jiang Zhen paid a little more personal attention to him. Seeing the name written by Li Mingzhe and the address of Lijia Village, he was surprised to see the thirty-something-year-old businessman. This person . . . seemed to be the one who had stolen Xue, the wife of Zhao Jinge\u2019s former fiance, Li Zugan . . .Jiang Zhen knew about Li Mingzhe, but Li Mingzhe didn\u2019t know about him. To him, it was just a concubine who came to have a baby. He didn\u2019t care about what happened before that concubine walked through his door, much less what his concubine\u2019s former man had done.After discussing with Jiang Zhen, he left a deposit of ten silver and asked Jiang Zhen to pick up the goods from Lijia Village the next day and then left.With Li Mingzhe taking the lead, more and more people came to sign the contract and negotiate the terms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He even made it clear that he would come to see the situation first before he decided whether to do business with them or not. With such prudence, it made the merchants trust him even more.While Jiang Zhen was dealing with the businessmen, his men were confused. They used to come to these people\u2019s houses to collect debts, but now . . . they would protect these people\u2019s businesses? It was somewhat weird . . . But even though it felt strange, most of them were happy.It was better to do decent business than to be a thug, and when they stood there, dressed like that, people around them looked at them in awe, which felt really great! They vaguely remembered something that Jiang Zhen had said earlier that even though there were many . . . they might actually be able to make something of it.Jiang Zhen had been busy all day before he finished writing down the situation and address of all the merchants who wanted their goods to be delivered, then he had a lot to do.\u201cJinge, how are you feeling today?\u201d on the way home, Jiang Zhen asked Zhao Jinge.Zhao Jinge was a bit shocked. That day he didn\u2019t feel anything other than that Jiang Zhen was particularly powerful.Jiang Zhen smiled and put his arm around his shoulders, then they walked ahead together. While walking, Jiang Zhen talked with Zhao Jinge. For example, which businessman seemed to be unreliable or which businessman should be taken good care of, and that it could be a long-term business if they were successful.\u201cI have too few people now . . .\u201d Speaking of this, Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t help but frown. At the moment, he didn\u2019t even have anyone under him who could read, and it would really be too troublesome for him to do everything himself.Jiang Zhen has more than thirty people under him. Is it still too few? Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen with surprise.In the current era, people seldom had business chains. After all, transportation was so inconvenient that even those big businessmen did not have many people. Jiang Zhen, thinking he had too few people, was really strange to Zhao Jinge. But Jiang Zhen had seen how developed the modern logistics industry was. He had only thirty people now, and he could only work in one line at a time. Under such circumstances, he naturally felt that he had too few people.\u201cJinge, what do you think should be the name of our business?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked again.\u201cIt needs a name?\u201d\u201cOf course, it should have a name.\u201d Jiang Zhen laughed. \u201cHow about . . . we just call it Jinzhen Escort Agency. I\u2019ll teach you how to write it when we get back.\u201dAlthough there were escort agencies everywhere in martial arts novels, in fact, in the history of the world Jiang Zhen came from, escort agencies did not appear until the Qing Dynasty, and then they started growing rapidly. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, even many ministers of the central government hired an escort agency to protect them and their mansions.At that time, the escort agency became more and more powerful, and in some places, even the government had to give way to the escort agency . . . Unfortunately, in the end, these escort agencies only flourished during this one dynasty before they disappeared.Of course, in the Ming Dynasty, before the Qing Dynasty, there were people who were escorting goods and protected the safety of merchants and even helped people collect debts and beat up people. When these people got together, they set up fists as sign.If this Daqi Dynasty continued to develop, it would probably also develop an escort agency. But at this moment, Jiang Zhen led a group of thugs to directly open an escort agency.After Jiang Zhen went back with Zhao Jinge, he told Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu that he had opened his own escort agency and would be going outside.Jiang Zhen was a man of great ideas and ability, so Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu naturally didn\u2019t try to stop him. After a moment\u2019s silence, Zhao Fugui only took out all the silver that Jiang Zhen had given him before.\u201cTake it. You always need to bring more silver with you when you go outside.\u201dOriginally, Zhao Fugui wanted to buy land after he got the silver, but he hadn\u2019t found a suitable plot, so he postponed it.\u201cFather, no need. I have some silver on hand, and those merchants already paid a deposit for the delivery of their goods,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.These days, unlike in modern society, they didn\u2019t charge a small fee for deliveries, so he actually charged a lot. According to his speculation, after this trip, after deducting various expenses and paying his subordinates, he would earn at least a few dozens of silver. This money didn\u2019t seem like a lot but it was a start.\u201cAs long as you have a clear idea, you can rest assured that we will take good care of Jinge at home,\u201d Zhao Fugui said, and took another look at Zhao Jinge.It had been almost a month since Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge got married. This month, they were very close and were inseparable, suggesting that his son might already carry a child in his belly. When Jiang Zhen went out this time, after he came back, Jinge might have a surprise for him. Even without children . . . now that they had money, they could take this opportunity to take care of Jinge in turn.Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu prepared to have dinner.Jiang Zhen gave even his men meat to eat. Of course, it was impossible to treat Zhao Fugui and his wife badly. The Zhao family\u2019s meals were very good these days, allowing Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu to eat till they were full, making them even look several years younger.This evening, the Zhao family ate duck meat.Duck meat had a taste that some people couldn\u2019t stand, but in this era no one was picky about it and Zhao Liu only disliked the lack of duck meat.Jiang Zhen ate two bowls of rice with braised duck meat, steamed eggplant, and fried cowpeas. Then he took Zhao Jinge back to their room and continued to teach him how to read and write Chinese characters. He himself was also learning how to read a few Chinese characters. He didn\u2019t want to practice his own handwriting, he just wanted to be able to write correctly so that he wouldn\u2019t need to consult others. He just needed to write slowly according to the books. The only trouble was that he couldn\u2019t write small characters for the moment.In modern times, everyone practiced writing large words, but in fact, the writing of ancient people was very small . . . It was not easy to write such a small word with a brush that was relatively symmetrical with a thick horizontal character and relatively well-proportioned at the same time. In order to practice his writing, Jiang Zhen even bought more paper and wrote more slowly.Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t use paper to practice his calligraphy; he wrote slowly on his sand table. However, he would take the paper that Jiang Zhen used to practice his writing on. Although what was often written out was a black mess, that piece could still be read; it could still be used to look at to get a feel for it.After practicing his calligraphy, Jiang Zhen grabbed Zhao Jinge and directly pulled him to the bed. Although the weather was getting hotter and hotter, his heart was getting even hotter, and he was reluctant to give up such beautiful bed sports.In the early morning of the next day, Jiang Zhen did not rush to take Zhao Jinge out as usual but stayed with him at home for a while.When Zhao Fugui and Zhao Liu saw this scene, they were a bit confused. They saw that people wearing the same clothes came to their house one after another. These people were all young, in their twenties and thirties, and they were all in high spirits. Zhao Liu couldn\u2019t help glancing at them a few more times.Then her expression froze. The one who looked the strongest among these people, wasn\u2019t it Liu Heitou? In the past, when he came to their house to cause trouble, Liu Heitou looked very fierce. But now . . . Zhao Liu suddenly realized that these people were wearing the clothes that she had ordered, the same clothes that Jiang Zhen said he had given to his men . . . This Liu Heitou had really become Jiang Zhen\u2019s subordinate! Zhao Liu immediately felt a sense of pride.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She went to find someone to talk to.Jiang Zhen went to Lijia first.Li Mingzhe had his family\u2019s long-term worker already sort out the goods. After Jiang Zhen had looked at the goods and made sure they were in order, he signed an even more detailed contract with Li Mingzhe.\u201cI have a lot of things going on at home lately, so I won\u2019t follow along, but my cousin will go with you and show you the way when you get there.\u201d Li Mingzhe was a pretty good talker. After talking with Jiang Zhen about various situations, he even asked Jiang Zhen to stay for dinner.\u201cNo need,\u201d Jiang Zhen refused. \u201cI have a lot of people with me, and I\u2019ve especially invited some people to cook, so it is time to go back for dinner.\u201d\u201cThen next time we are free, I\u2019ll invite Older Brother Jiang for dinner,\u201d Li Mingzhe said, and then personally sent Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge out.\u201cMaster, it\u2019s happening again outside!\u201dJust then, a woman who looked about twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old hurried in from outside with a child in her arms, her face not looking very good. She walked somewhat in a hurry, but after noticing that Li Mingzhe was sending Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge back, she immediately slowed down.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Li Mingzhe asked and introduced Jiang Zhen again, saying that the woman was his wife and that the child in her arms was his son.\u201cMaster, it\u2019s nothing important.\u201dWhen the woman came in, she said that there was a disturbance outside, but now she kept silent with a smile and asked Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge to stay for dinner.Jiang Zhen refused again. Jiang Zhen arranged for his men to carry the goods, and by the time all the goods had been carried on the ship, it was time for him to go. But as soon as he walked out of the house, he saw an acquaintance standing outside.It was the very thin and small Li Zugen who he had once beaten up because he was trying to hit on Zhao Jinge. This Li Zugen was very timid, and after being beaten by him once, he never dared to come back, which made Jiang Zhen feel it was quite a pity. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that it would have affected Zhao Jinge if things went too far, Jiang Zhen would have wanted to go to his house to teach him another lesson . . . Of course, he didn\u2019t do that. As a result, just after he got married to Zhao Jinge, he had pretty much forgotten about this person. Right now, he was surprised to meet this person again . . .When Jiang Zhen saw Li Zugen and Li Zugen saw Jiang Zhen, his whole body suddenly froze up.This Li Zugan, since he was a child, was protected by his parents like a treasure. Because his mother was so fierce, when he played with others as a child, he had never been wronged or hit. So it was really scary for him to be beaten by Jiang Zhen last time. These days, he didn\u2019t even dare to set foot in Hexi Village anymore! But even though he didn\u2019t go to Hexi Village to find Zhao Jinge, this day would still come.Li Zugen\u2019s parents also knew that they couldn\u2019t sit idly by, so they used the remaining silver to buy 3 mu of paddy field. Since they couldn\u2019t finish planting them, they rented them out. It was a good idea, but in this way, Li Zugen wouldn\u2019t be able to marry a wife.His parents told him to take care of his four children and not to marry a wife. Even if he could live a good life, Li Zugen didn\u2019t want to. He wanted a wife who could warm his bed. But . . . if his Li family couldn\u2019t bring out the bride price, who would be willing to marry him? Li Zugen couldn\u2019t think of a way, so he finally set his mind on Xue, who had abandoned him and the children.Although Xue was now a concubine and was pregnant with another child and received good treatment at Li Mingzhe\u2019s house, when Li Zugen went to look for her with their four children pitifully, she became soft-hearted. Speaking of which, as long as Li Zugen\u2019s family life was a little better, Xue wouldn\u2019t want to stay at Li Mingzhe\u2019s house, but she was afraid of poverty. Thinking about the days when there was not enough to eat at Li Zugen\u2019s house and there were always people who came to ask for the repayment of debts during the Spring Festival, even if Li Mingzhe didn\u2019t really like her and her own children didn\u2019t call her \u201cmother\u201d here, Xue still wasn\u2019t willing to go back. But even if she didn\u2019t leave, she still felt sorry for her other children, so when Li Zugen came to the door, she gave him some money she had saved and brought stewed chicken from the kitchen to let her children eat.Then . . . Li Zugen kept pestering her.Since Xue was able to abandon her husband and sons, she was not the kind of person who was willing to be squeezed again and again. She immediately fell out with Li Zugen.Li Mingzhe happened to see that scene, but he was very good tempered. He felt some sympathy for Li Zugen\u2019s thin appearance and gave him ten silver.This was a mistake! Originally, Li Zugen pestered Xue and hid from Li Mingzhe, the landlord. He didn\u2019t dare to offend Li Mingzhe. But now . . . Li Zugen was suddenly no longer afraid of Li Mingzhe. Compared with Jiang Zhen, this landlord who was always smiling, was not so terrible. Even when he made a lot of trouble, he just let the long-term worker in the family pull him out . . . From time to time, he would come to annoy him and receive some money.At the moment, Li Zugen came to make trouble, as he did every day, which was why Li Mingzhe didn\u2019t want to go out. His wife was taking care of a child less than two years old and his concubine still had one in her belly. If she was frightened by this meddler . . .\u201cLi Zugen, what\u2019s the matter with you?\u201d Seeing Li Zugan, Li Mingzhe couldn\u2019t help but frown.Li Mingzhe\u2019s wife, however, was viciously glaring at her husband. If it weren\u2019t for her husband\u2019s rotten kindness, how could Li Zugen stick to them?\u201cLi Zugen, I\u2019ll have someone take you to the backyard,\u201d Li Mingzhe\u2019s wife said.She wanted to get rid of Li Zugen first, so she would not lose face in front of others. As a result . . . Li Zugen was now in a daze and was unable to move.\u201cMaster Li, apart from delivering goods to others, our Jinzhen Escort Agency will also take care of some other work to help people solve their various problems no matter whether it is about their domestic problems or teaching people a lesson concerning their debt. If it is not a problem, does Master Li want some help?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked. \u201cThis kind of small trouble can be solved by calling someone to beat him at random. Only ten silver will guarantee that he won\u2019t dare to come to your door again . . .\u201dJiang Zhen was smiling when he spoke to Li Mingzhe and then gave Li Zugen a glare.People then saw Li Zugen shaking all over before quickly running away.Li Mingzhe: \u201c. . .\u201d This person who had been pestering him for several days was scared away just by a look?\u201cHere, the ten silver you said about earlier . . .\u201d Li Zugen\u2019s wife couldn\u2019t help but say. She really couldn\u2019t bear that Li family, feeling as if she did something heinous . . . However, it was Xue who insisted on staying, and it was Li Zugen who promised to borrow his wife\u2019s belly to have children at the beginning.\u201cNo need, Lady Li. I was just joking.\u201d Jiang Zhen smiled and left with Zhao Jinge.After leaving the Li family, Jiang Zhen took his people to another merchant. He did not like procrastination, and after three days\u2019 work, he moved all the goods to his chartered ship and also found local sailors.They were ready to go.Early that morning, in order to display unity Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge changed into clothes similar to their subordinates\u2019, but with more decorations on the shoulders, and then they went out with their things.It was at this moment that Zhao Liu noticed something was wrong. \u201cWait! Jinge is going too?\u201dShe always thought it was Jiang Zhen who was going out alone! As it turned out, her son was going too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With her Jinge following Jiang Zhen, that little goblin should have known when to retreat, right?Because of this idea, Zhao Liu had never stopped Zhao Jinge from following Jiang Zhen before, but now that they would travel so far away, how inconvenient would it be for Jinge to travel so far away?\u201cOf course, Jinge is going too,\u201d Jiang Zhen did not hesitate to say. It would make no sense for him to go so far away from home only a month after their marriage. In modern times, there were a lot of women going around and doing business, and Zhao Jinge, as a strong man, was no worse than them.Jiang Zhen also knew that, in other people\u2019s eyes, Zhao Jinge was a ger who only needed to marry and take care of the children at home. But in his opinion, Zhao Jinge was not inferior to those men. Even Zhao Jinge himself was working hard to master various skills and strived to become even better! In that case, he definitely had to give Zhao Jinge a chance.\u201cMom, I want to go,\u201d Zhao Jinge said too.If he had been raised as a ger at home all this time, he might not have those shocking thoughts, but for a long time, he had been living like a man. These days, when he went out with Jiang Zhen and trained with Jiang Zhen\u2019s men, he was actually having a good time. Of course, the most important thing was that he hoped to become as powerful as Jiang Zhen and do something for him, and not appear so useless.Zhao Liu nervously looked at the two people in front of her and didn\u2019t try to stop him.After Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge left, she looked for someone to chat again and started sighing. \u201cYou said that Jiang Zhen was alright, but he even had to take my Jinge with him when he left. He can\u2019t bear to leave him even for a moment . . .\u201dDon\u2019t think we don\u2019t know how smug you are when you make a face like that! The people listening to Zhao Liu were very depressed, but they actually . . . somehow liked to hear Zhao Liu talk like this. In this village, Zhao Fugui was an exceptionally good man. Which one of them did not envy Zhao Liu? Now there was another one, Jiang Zhen . . . Even if they were just listening, they were happy in their hearts.Listening to Zhao Liu talk about Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge, someone suddenly mentioned old lady Jiang.\u201cDid you know that the second son of the Jiang family has also gone to do business?\u201d\u201cI heard something. What about it?\u201d Zhao Liu asked.\u201cOld lady Jiang has been boasting about her second son every day recently. Her second son borrowed a boat from the village head\u2019s house, saying that he would earn a lot of money when he came back with plenty of seafood.\u201d\u201cSo he went to buy seafood too . . .\u201d Zhao Liu sighed. At the beginning, Jiang Zhen had also started his business selling seafood. Now unexpectedly, Jiang Chengwen had also gone to buy seafood.\u201cCan you really make money by buying and selling seafood?\u201d the man asked again.\u201cI think so? But Jiang Zhen said it was very hard. You see, he only did it because he only had little capital and has already quit doing it,\u201d Zhao Liu said.She didn\u2019t know much about Jiang Zhen\u2019s business, but she heard Zhao Jinge saying it was too tiring to do the sea goods business.\u201cSo . . .\u201dHearing Zhao Liu\u2019s words, some people who had heard that it was a good business to sell sea goods before and also wanted to sell sea goods like Jiang Chengwen immediately fell silent. They had better first see how Jiang Chengwen would do with this business and then decide whether they want to do this business too.The Jiang family was very lively at the moment. Jiang Chengwen had come back with a large ship filled with sea goods. He had already calculated that, if he could sell everything, he should be able to earn double! He had bought twenty silver of goods, that was to say, he could earn back twenty silver!For a while, when Jiang Chengwen was walking, he was very angry. What about Jiang Chengxiang? After reading books for so many years, he could only earn two silver a month? If it were Jiang Zhen . . .Thinking of all the things that people in the village said that Jiang Zhen had done, Jiang Chengwen did not dare to say he would become more powerful than Jiang Zhen. At least he couldn\u2019t defeat Jiang Zhen in a fight. But he still felt that, one day, he would be able to surpass Jiang Zhen, the eldest brother who had always been ignored by him.Old lady Jiang also felt the same way. Seeing the people she knew coming to her house to buy salted fish and kelp, she was very happy and couldn\u2019t close her mouth. Her second son was the best!Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t know about Jiang Chengwen. At that time, he was already on his boat, ready to leave Hecheng county. Most of those small merchants went along with them, and only a few, like Li Mingzhe, sent other people with them. With so many people and more goods than Jiang Zhen had thought there would be at the beginning, Jiang Zhen rented another boat to fit everyone in.The cargo had been checked and loaded on the ship long ago, and that day, Jiang Zhen was just checking again the merchants and the belongings they carried on board.Jiang Zhen inspected everything carefully and said that it was for the sake of everyone\u2019s safety, so naturally, these merchants were not the least bit displeased. What merchants cared the most about, apart from money, was security.At about nine o\u2019clock in the morning, the two ships left the dock and headed for Fucheng.After the ship started moving forward, Jiang Zhen was not idle. He went to see how the sailors operated the ship and also asked Wang Haisheng, the He brothers, and several other people he trusted to learn from them.As a matter of fact, the more than thirty people Jiang Zhen took in were all picked by him. If there was something wrong with their conduct, he would exclude them from the very beginning. In fact, Liu Heitou was the most unstable element in the whole group. But this Liu Heitou . . . it was impossible for Jiang Zhen to kill him. If he let him go, he would probably secretly make trouble for him . . . After thinking about it over and over again, Jiang Zhen simply kept an eye on him observing him. With him watching, it would be impossible for Liu Heitou to play any tricks on him.However, although there was nothing wrong with these people except for Liu Heitou, Jiang Zhen was still unable to trust all of them, which was reflected in the way he arranged their work for them. Of course, these people probably didn\u2019t see it. The people he arranged to patrol the deck because of his mistrust were even a little proud . . .The people on the two boats, wherever they were thugs or merchants, were all natives of Hecheng county. They had basically all been on boats, and they were used to small boats that were unstable. Therefore, although some people were not feeling well, no one was seasick.At noon, everyone ate on boat. When Jiang Zhen talked to the merchants before, he also talked about food expenses. They had their meals on board, and these merchants could arrange it ahead of time. They could have the kitchen prepare meals for them, or they could eat what they had brought.That day, because it was the first day, almost everyone ate the food they had brought, and only a few people asked for onboard meals.Jiang Zhen had asked two women who cooked for them in Qiaotou Village to prepare the meals on the ship. The taste was average. However, because of his requirements, there were two kinds of vegetable dishes and a meat dish, and there was also soup to each meal, which was considered rich.Currently, the most common vegetables in Hecheng county were cowpeas, green beans, cucumbers, eggplants, lucerne, and so on. On that day, the noon meal consisted of fried cowpeas, pickled cucumbers, lucerne, and pickled vegetable soup; as for the meat dish, it was braised pork.Some merchants who had brought their own food regretted not eating on the boat, so when someone came to ask later, they said that they would eat the onboard meal that night. They also learned that they could order some extra dishes on the boat, and so the others ordered a stir fry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 70.2 - Life on boardPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayDuring the day, Jiang Zhen had been very busy, but in the evening, after approaching Fucheng, he relaxed. Thinking that it was Zhao Jinge\u2019s first time away from home, Jiang Zhen thought about making him eat better, so he went to the galley, or the place where the cooking took place, intending to cook two dishes himself. He chose a piece of pork and stir-fried it in the pan with oil, then put in two cloves of garlic and fried it until it was fragrant, and then added the cowpeas to the stir-fry. His cooking skills were not very good, but the cowpeas fried like this were definitely better than the cowpeas cooked by these two women.After preparing the meat slices and the fried cowpeas, Jiang Zhen fried a bowl of eggplant with sauce and then went to Zhao Jinge with the rice and the braised meat.At that time, the ships they used were not small, but they still could not be compared to those big ships from the modern era, so the places where people could live were also small. No matter if it was Jiang Zhen\u2019s men or the merchants, they all slept in the same cabin, but Jiang Zhen and Zhao Jinge had a separate cabin.The room was small, only about four square meters, but at least no one came to disturb them. Jiang Zhen entered the room with the food and saw Zhao Jinge playing with the abacus there.This abacus was brought by Jiang Zhen. When he was a child, he learned a little about the abacus in his math class. But to be honest, at the moment, except for the one above representing five and the one below representing one, he had almost forgotten everything else. He was going to relearn it, but unfortunately, he hadn\u2019t had the time yet.\u201cJiang Zhen, you are back!\u201d Seeing Jiang Zhen, Zhao Jinge immediately stood up.\u201cWell, dinner is ready.\u201d Jiang Zhen put down his bowl and added, \u201cTomorrow we will stop at this side of Fucheng for a day. Would you like to go ashore?\u201d\u201cAre you going?\u201d Zhao Jinge asked.\u201cI\u2019ll be a little busy,\u201d Jiang Zhen said. After all, it was the first trip out. He had to keep an eye on everything, and he had no time to accompany Zhao Jinge for a stroll.\u201cThen I won\u2019t go either. I\u2019ll help you,\u201d Zhao Jinge said. Although there were some things he didn\u2019t understand, he could do simple things like ordering and other things, so he could also help Jiang Zhen a little.\u201cGood.\u201d Jiang Zhen went over and gave Zhao Jinge a kiss.Zhao Jinge was started, but did not try to avoid it and just said, \u201cDon\u2019t do this. We are on the boat.\u201d The soundproofing on this ship was not very good. He could even hear what was said next door . . .\u201cIt\u2019s just a kiss. We won\u2019t do that. What are you afraid of? Even if we do . . . It will be alright if you keep your voice down,\u201d Jiang Zhen teased.\u201cThen . . . Then you must also pay attention, and don\u2019t make any noise,\u201d Zhao Jinge thought about it and said to Jiang Zhen.Jiang Zhen: \u201c. . .\u201dWhen he flirted with him, he forgot that Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t make a sound even when he was extremely happy, so . . . They only made noise at night, basically because he moved too vigorously and the bed creaked. But when Zhao Jinge said that, it was somewhat strange . . .\u201cWhy don\u2019t you move and do it gently?\u201d Jiang Zhen said again.\u201cI?\u201d Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen puzzled. How could he be the one to move?\u201cEat first, and I will teach you later in the evening,\u201d Jiang Zhen said.Zhao Jinge started eating in silence, but his heart was beating like a drum. He already had a bad premonition. How could Jiang Zhen know so much?Zhao Jinge went out to work with his father from a young age. Because he listened to other people\u2019s dirty talk, he knew more or less about men and women\u2019s affairs. But after spending time with Jiang Zhen . . . Zhao Jinge suddenly found that he seemed to know too little. How could Jiang Zhen know so much?Zhao Jinge did not understand, so he ate a few more mouthfuls of food and then asked, \u201cDid you ask this woman to especially cook this? This piece of meat is really delicious.\u201c\u201cThat woman can\u2019t cook something so delicious, so I made it.\u201d Jiang Zhen laughed.Zhao Jinge looked at Jiang Zhen in surprise and suddenly regretted eating too fast and not tasting it well.Although he had eaten a lot of food cooked by Jiang Zhen before, he hadn\u2019t eaten anything made by him since their relationship was made official . . . Moreover, Jiang Zhen had made it extra for him to eat. Just thinking about it, Zhao Jinge felt satisfied. Jiang Zhen was very good, he had to work harder, so that he could help him.Although Zhao Jinge liked to eat sliced meat, he only ate two pieces to taste it, then he stopped moving his chopsticks intending to let Jiang Zhen eat more.Jiang Zhen knew what he was thinking, so he put his chopsticks in the bowl and said, \u201cDon\u2019t act like a stranger in the future. If you don\u2019t eat it, I will give it to others to see what you will do.\u201dZhao Jinge was shocked.\u201cI knew a businessman named Fang before. He was poor when he was young and lived a bad life. His wife was an ordinary village woman. Later, when he got rich, he bought this and that for her and wanted her to dress up beautifully. However, his wife thought it was just a waste of money. She was unwilling to make more delicious food for him at home. Later, he didn\u2019t like going back home. He went to a restaurant every day and then took a concubine . . .\u201dJiang Zhen started to make up a story to scare Zhao Jinge. \u201cThe concubine wanted rouge and powder today; silk and satin tomorrow; chicken, duck, and fish for dinner; sedan chair and carriage for going out. The money was spent just like water, but the businessman surnamed Fang still liked her because he could live comfortably with her. Later, he didn\u2019t even want to see his old wife, so he was afraid to go back. At that time, his wife still thought that even killing a chicken was too wasteful.\u201d\u201c!\u201d Zhao Jinge quickly ate a piece of meat.In fact, Jiang Zhen spent a lot of money, and every two days, he would buy a chicken or a duck to eat. He felt that it was quite wasteful, but he thought that all this money belonged to Jiang Zhen, so he didn\u2019t say anything. But . . . if Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t buy it, he really wouldn\u2019t buy and eat it. After that . . .After scaring Zhao Jinge and finishing the meal, Jiang Zhen lay down on the bed. He was a little tired after that busy day. Zhao Jinge frowned and took the bowl and chopsticks outside deep in thought. But as soon as he went out, he was stopped.\u201cZhao Jinge!\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d When Zhao Jinge looked over, he found it was one of Jiang Zhen\u2019s men, Ding Lian.\u201cBefore, when Boss cooked, was it for you to eat?\u201d Ding Lian glanced at the dishes in Zhao Jinge\u2019s hands and then looked at Zhao Jinge with a complicated expression.At first, they thought that Jiang Zhen didn\u2019t care about Zhao Jinge and didn\u2019t value him, otherwise, how could he possibly let a ger run around and train with a group of big men like them? But as time went on, they soon found out they were wrong. In fact, Jiang Zhen was very good to Zhao Jinge. At least, what Jiang Zhen taught Zhao Jinge was never taught to them. Of course, they didn\u2019t have anything to say about it either . . . it wasn\u2019t like they were Jiang Zhen\u2019s gers. Why would Jiang Zhen teach them something that was so hard?However, although they all knew that Jiang Zhen was very good to Zhao Jinge, it still surprised them that Jiang Zhen would cook for Zhao Jinge. Men, especially married ones with their wife still around . . . how could they not let their wife serve them? And even cook for the wife?Jiang Zhen was so good to Zhao Jinge, that it was beyond good. It was said that, in order to marry Zhao Jinge, he was even willing to marry in his wife\u2019s family . . .\u201cBoss is very kind to you.\u201d Ding Lian sighed.Zhao Jinge nodded. He also thought Jiang Zhen was very kind to him, so . . . if Jiang Zhen wanted to teach him something in the evening, he would study hard.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 100": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/The Only Favourite Ugly HusbandChapter 71.1 - Preparing to go to the capitalPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis time Jiang Zhen took his men and the two boats with him to basically wander around Hecheng County, going to many places that he and Wang Haisheng had already visited, so it was still relatively safe. But, in the end, it was still the first trip out, and thus, he had to be more careful and had a lot of work to do.After a short nap after dinner, Jiang Zhen got up. By that time, their ship had slowly approached Fucheng and stopped at the pier.When Jiang Zhen\u2019s men stayed on the ship, they all felt it was quite novel, and no one was bored. But when the ship docked and Jiang Zhen told them to move some of the cargo off the ship ahead of time and arranged for a night watch, some of them were unhappy. That person was, of course, Liu Hetou.\u201cIt is already nighttime. Why do we still have to work?\u201d Liu Heitou asked discontentedly, trying to incite those around him.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do it. Moreover, you can also quit following me . . . Do you think it will be hard for me to find a few people to work for me?\u201dJiang Zhen looked at him with a cold smile on his face. He had nothing before, and no one would have come even if he wanted to recruit someone. Coupled with the fact that he was worried that Liu Heitou\u2019s gang would get together and cause trouble for him, he took them in, but in the future . . .In fact, it was still better to use hardworking and uncomplaining people like Wang Haisheng and the He brothers, who gave their all, right?As soon as Jiang Zhen spoke, Liu Heitou\u2019s heart jumped. He himself was a jealous man, so he felt that Jiang Zhen would probably be the same. He followed Jiang Zhen, and there were so many people watching. Jiang Zhen couldn\u2019t do anything to him to keep his men from quitting, but if they left from this place . . . That guy Jiang Zhen had seen blood!Liu Heitou suddenly became silent and started working obediently. When the others heard what Jiang Zhen said, they were startled. But when they thought about it carefully, they found that Jiang Zhen was quite right.These days, there was no shortage of people, and with the treatment given by Jiang Zhen, it would be easy to recruit people in the future. But they . . . they couldn\u2019t be thugs without this place. What should they do? These guys started working harder.Jiang Zhen was very satisfied with this and thought that the punishment and reward measures should be perfected. In the future, if there were people who did things carelessly, it would be good to directly drive them out. Of course, he didn\u2019t think there would be anyone like that. These people were actually quite obedient now.After working busily for more than an hour unloading the cargo from the ship and putting it in the open space, Jiang Zhen went back to the ship and arranged for someone to keep watch over it.Zhao Jinge was also helping carry the goods off the ship and counting them. When he returned to their room, Jiang Zhen held his hand and asked, \u201cTired?\u201d\u201cNot tired,\u201d Zhao Jinge answered. This kind of work was really nothing to him.Although Zhao Jinge said that he wasn\u2019t tired, it was still the first time they had gone out. Jiang Zhen did not intend to do anything this evening . . . As a result . . .\u201cJiang Zhen, you said earlier that you were going to teach me at night . . . what were you going to teach me?\u201d In the darkness of the cabin, Zhao Jinge asked curiously.What Jiang Zhen wanted to teach Zhao Jinge, of course, was a way to keep the bed board from rocking. For example, with Zhao Jinge positioned on top of him and moving up and down. Zhao Jinge was very patient. He felt that he had taken the initiative, but in Jiang Zhen\u2019s opinion, he was actually very shy. Of course, having a shy partner wasn\u2019t bad, and Jiang Zhen quite enjoyed teaching Zhao Jinge a bit at times, not to mention that Zhao Jinge was always very cooperative with him . . .This time, the two of them really did not make any sound, and only when it was all over\u2014 Zhao Jinge had gotten off him when his legs went limp and he knocked on the bed board\u2014that there was a thumping sound, but this sound was so common in the ship that it would never make anyone suspect anything.Jiang Zhen thought it was a pity. Zhao Jinge also thought it was a pity. That position was not very good. After it was done, all those things flowed out, which was really disadvantageous for having a child. Thinking that way, Zhao Jinge touched his stomach.\u201cIs your stomach upset? Do you want me to help you clean up a bit?\u201d Jiang Zhen asked.He remembered that after it was done, it should be cleaned up; otherwise, it would be easy to get diarrhea.When they did it for the first time he was so excited that he had forgotten about it. And so, Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t like it. But when he saw that Zhao Jinge didn\u2019t get diarrhea, he didn\u2019t force it either. That was probably because a ger\u2019s body was somewhat different from that of an ordinary man, but unfortunately, he didn\u2019t see any difference at all.\u201cNo need,\u201d Zhao Jinge said hurriedly.How could he clean it up at this moment? His mother said it was best to lie still afterward. Zhao Jinge gave himself a rub and lay down. Seeing this Jiang Zhen reached out to touch his stomach, he asked, \u201cDo you think there could already be a child inside?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know, but the villagers said before that it wouldn\u2019t be easy for me to have children.\u201dZhao Jinge felt a little lost. It was not easy to have children as a woman, let alone a ger like him.\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Take your time.\u201d Jiang Zhen kissed Zhao Jinge, thinking that it would be fine to not have children.It was already very hot today, and it was even hotter in the cabin. Although they were all used to the heat, it was not easy right after their exercise.Zhao Jinge took a fan and slowly fanned himself and Jiang Zhen until he fell asleep without realizing it. Jiang Zhen took the fan from his hand and fanned him for a while before throwing it away and going to sleep.The next day, all the merchants whose destination was Fucheng debarked. Meanwhile, Jiang Zhen had sent his men to patrol around the dock and bring back a few merchants who were going to their next destination.These merchants were all willing to pay some money to take the big boat. After all, in this part of Yangtze River, large groups of water bandits were rare, which meant that it was very safe to take a big boat.Because the cargo had already been moved off the ship last night, that day was actually not as busy as Jiang Zhen had previously imagined. So after lunch, he took some time off to show Zhao Jinge around.After telling Wang Haisheng and the He brothers to keep an eye on the boat, Jiang Zhen went out with Zhao Jinge.\u201cBoss is so nice to Zhao Jinge. I can\u2019t believe he loves his wife so much.\u201d Someone came over to talk to the He brothers.He Chunsheng nodded and sighed. If he had known that Jiang Zhen was so good, he would have betrothed his brother to Jiang Zhen earlier . . . Unfortunately, it was too late for it now.\u201cBy the way, He Chunsheng, I heard that you have a ger brother who is very good looking . . . What do you think of me? I swear I\u2019ll love my wife as much as Boss Jiang!\u201d the man added.He Chunsheng\u2019s face turned black. This man was so ugly, and he still dared to think about his brother? When he thought of this, He Chunsheng couldn\u2019t help glancing at Liu Heitou again.He Chunsheng and Liu Heitou had a big feud, but because Liu Heitou had only brought his own cousins when he went to the He family to kidnap people, He Chunsheng had no conflict with the others.Seeing that Liu Heitou was being annoying, He Xiaosheng stared at Liu Hetou all day.Being stared at like this . . . Liu Heitou felt quite safe. At least, it meant that these people were not going to tie him up and throw him in the river, right?Jiang Zhen went to buy a few pieces of cloth, then found the tailor who had helped him make clothes earlier and commissioned her to make a few flags. If his escort agency was to be opened, there was still a lot of work to do. First of all, the flag had to be done.\u201cWhat should be embroidered on this?\u201d asked the tailor.\u201cJust embroider the word \u2018Zhen,\u2019\u201d Jiang Zhen said and then made a few more suggestions.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>"
