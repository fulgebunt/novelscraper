The day I was born.\u201dI stated the date while clenching the old and bloodstained talisman.***This constant rhythm that heralded the beginning of my world was my mother\u2019s heartbeat, and it was her amniotic fluid that covered my naked body.So, the darkness that spread in front of me when I opened my eyes was comforting rather than foreboding, as the dungeons had been.I was in my mother\u2019s womb.Her heartbeat gently carried away my memories of the grim days and the despair that forced me to reverse time and escape to the past.Since mothers will always be mothers, my eyes grew heavy, just hearing the sound. It had been such a long time since I was able to do so.I felt a deep pleasure as my mind grew dim, and the thought of finally being able to sleep pleased me. Until this moment, sleep had eluded me. I tried to hide my eyes with both hands to fall asleep again.However, my tiny arms and legs were out of my control, and they touched the walls of my womb. My mother\u2019s voice was a mumble, and her heartbeat was louder than her words.Still, from the lightness of her tone, she probably woke my father to boast the strong movements their baby had made.***The reason I chose the day I was born instead of the next day or after I had grown to go back was because of the trait he had. The process of gaining a rare achievement was a secret more important than life.I had discovered what he had kept hidden. He had Awakened in advance in his mother\u2019s womb. He had to be the only individual who had the memories of being a fetus and a pre-Awakener. I knew of his achievement and the power of Overcoming Adversity. This achievement had made him the most powerful of the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues.However, the mechanism of achieving this trait was not something anyone would go through since it was the process of being pushed out of a mother\u2019s womb through the birth canal. The distinction of having accomplished this achievement was whether one could overcome the hardship and pain involved.No one remembers when they were born. Even the one who Overcome Adversity, who had the memories of being a fetus, could not remember the details of the agony of their birth.He was the same, as he had spoken that the most painful moment of his entire life was when he was being pushed through the birth canal, and if people could remembered that moment, we would be as inevitably self-centered as he, after going through such an ordeal to be born. This was the reason for his extreme narcissism despite his plain face.Was going through the birth canal such a painful experience?***Something had to be going wrong. I knew that this would be a painful experience, but everything went awry.The pressure that was suffocating me from everywhere overwhelmed my senses.There was little left of the amniotic fluid that would have protected me. Also, my body had grown to fill my mother\u2019s womb since I was just about to be born.I was being crushed in this narrow space since I had to endure it as a frail fetus. I thought my fat was melting, my muscle were being shredded, and my bones were being crushed.He had not been lying.My soft flesh which burst under even the slightest pressure did not protect me and was on fire as I was going through the birth canal.I knew that screaming would waste all my efforts without anyone telling me so. However, I was about to open my mouth to scream when something fluidlike threatened to fill my lungs.I would have committed a sin if I had opened my mouth to scream. It was not about me dying, but my mother\u2019s life also hung in the balance.My mind grew white.I knew only pain, and I believed I would ally with the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues if I could escape from this hell a moment earlier.The pain when my skull was compressed at the end of the canal was above anything I had imagined. My head was going to be crushed, and I would die, feeling my brain squeezed out through my nose and eyes. The only way to end this pain was to wrap my neck with the umbilical cord.It was that moment I heard my mother cry softly.Hello, mother.***I did not think more than thirty minutes would have passed in real-time. However, it felt like more than thirty hours to me, as the endless pain slowed down my sense of time.Maybe something really went wrong. How can birth be this painful? Did everybody go through this hell just to be born?I could not believe humanity continued on in this fashion. The only reason I did not give up was because of my mother. I could feel the pain of giving birth from not only her moans but from the walls of the womb.I was not alone in this fight. My mother was with me.My mother pulled together her strength with tears, and the direction of the pressure that threatened to kill me was suddenly reversed. I added my own power in the do-or-die moment that pushed me onward, despite it being the feeble attempts of a new-born baby.The moment my skull escaped the clutches of the birth canal, I let out the scream that I had been repressing for the pain.I could now cry. The world became brighter. Mother, I thank you with all my heart.\u201cGaa, gaa.\u201d[You have accomplished the achievement of \u201cOvercoming Adversity.\u201d][You have gained the trait \u201cThe Man Who Overcome Adversity\u201d as the first-time bonus.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was the obscenely powerful trait that would make an S class to an SS class![The Man Who Overcome Adversity(Trait)Effect: The moment you are incapable of fighting, all stat levels and skill classes increase by one rank.

    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2My eyes suddenly opened as I felt I was falling off a cliff.I saw with unfocused eyes and a small arm moving of its own accord. The arm belonged to my body but was not mine yet. My body was out of my control at the moment and was only performing reflex movements irrelevant to outside stimuli.Modern science said that this happened as an infant\u2019s immature brain activities. They were right, as my brain was not fully grown yet. However, modern science would not be able to illuminate my current thought processes. They belonged in the religion category since the reason I could think like I am now was thanks to my soul.I moved my gaze with difficulty to the two people who were looking down on me. My undeveloped sight only saw shadows of their faces, and my hearing was about the same. My mother had said that she had given birth at home instead of a hospital because of our poor finances with help from her sister, who was a nurse.So, the two people staring at me would be my mother and my aunt.While I could not see much, the system message windows were clear. Reading them and my current eyesight seemed irrelevant, and probably functioned on the same basis of being able to think \u00a0with the underdeveloped brain of an infant.The messages went straight into my brain. I read the messages that appeared in front of me.[Quest \u2018Become Healthy 1\u2019 begins.][Become Healthy 1 (Quest)Mission: Drink breast milk three hundred times in one month.]I finally knew why the First Evil was one of the most powerful beings from the \u2018Day of Advent.\u2019 \u00a0He had accumulated points from when he was an infant, and in other words, he was a cheat.***\u201cYou have to wrap the arms and legs of a baby, or they wake up surprised and floundering.\u201d\u201cBut my son is crying so much. There\u2019s nothing wrong with him? He has all his fingers and toes, right?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve asked me that three times now. He\u2019s crying for you to feed him. Congratulations on a healthy son.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dJunghee washed the afterbirth off the baby and let Mihee hug Sunhoo. Mihee was crying not out of pain, but of gratitude for her baby being healthy. She still could not understand that she had become a mother and gave birth to a baby.However, Mihee could not take her eyes off her baby clamoring for her milk. She let Sunhoo drink from her breast and saw that her worries about not having enough milk for her baby were unfounded. Sunhoo sucked at her nipple and gulped down her milk.\u201cHe\u2019s a fierce eater.\u201d***It was interesting to feel my mouth move instinctively the moment my mouth was pressed to my mother\u2019s breast. It was an involuntary movement similar to my flailing arms and legs, and I felt like I was inside a small animal.I knew a person who used Soul Transference as a major skill. That individual would have observed his targets like this, inside their bodies but without control, before completely swallowing their souls.However, this was my body, and my limbs and lips that moved as they pleased were just reflexes. I did not need to fight with another soul because of Soul Transference.I felt a lukewarm liquid down my throat without tasting it much. However, l felt the liquid pour down my throat and stomach like when drinking water just after waking up in the morning.I could focus on drinking breast milk because my limbs were not moving, thanks to my aunt wrapping me in a blanket. My mother carefully supported my neck, and I could feel my stomach becoming full in the midst of maternal love.This was bliss, and I thought I might cry of sheer happiness. I felt relieved that I could not burst into tears yet. My mother would be astonished to see her son cry after feeding him breast milk for the first time.I did not remove my lips from my mother\u2019s breast until I could not drink anymore, and my lips stopped moving in reflex when I felt full.A message popped up. I only wished it didn\u2019t cover my mother\u2019s face.[Become Healthy: Drink breast milk 1/300]My aunt lifted me and she began to pat my back. I was starting to feel stuffed after being full, but I could not throw up what I had swallowed alone.I thought something was stuck in my stomach, but it was only a burp. I felt refreshed, and the sound of two women laughing was music to my ears.It was time for me to sleep when considering my mother had spent most of the early morning giving birth to me.However, I could not sleep because my body hurt everywhere. The pain I had suffered when going through the canal dissipated with my mother\u2019s milk. The torment I felt now was reduced from the pain I had felt then.The pain chased away my sleep whenever I tried to close my eyes, and truthfully, I did not want to sleep.My aunt\u2019s hands were as gentle as my mother\u2019s and the time I spent lying in her arms as she supported my back and neck was too dear and comfortable. However, I wanted to be in my mother\u2019s more awkward arms.I cried until my aunt handed me to my mother and did not stop even when my aunt rubbed my back and sang to me.When I immediately stopped crying the moment my mother held me, I heard the two women laugh again. I already began to feel sorry because I needed to drink breast milk at least ten times a day to complete the mission.I had to drink about twelve times a day to accomplish the quest safely, which meant I had to ask for my mother\u2019s milk every two hours.I saw to what extent my mother would have to sacrifice herself. She would lose nights and weekends.***I must have fallen asleep and woke up feeling hungry. I could repress crying out in hunger or wet diapers since my thought processes were not those of an infant.I wanted my mother to rest today. 1985 did not have postnatal care centers, and mothers lived with their babies by their side in this era.Moreover, my mother could not ask for help as both of my grandmothers had passed away, and my aunt had to go back to work.Since she had to raise me without any postnatal care, my mother\u2019s pelvis began to show problems in her forties.The Day of Advent was still far ahead, and I had thirty days before the deadline for this quest expired. So, my mother should rest at least for today since she would not be able to sleep at night from tomorrow.I began to endure the void in my stomach and was reminded how weak infants were as hunger was starting to turn into pain. While it did not hurt much, I felt like someone was poking my stomach.So, this was why babies could not endure being hungry. I had gone against the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues and had overcome the adversity of the birth canal with my mother. I could not ruin my mother\u2019s only day of rest because of this hunger.However, when the time came, my mother let me suck at her breast, and the survival instincts of an infant kicked in reflex.I should not do this, at least today\u2026[Become Healthy 1: Drink breast milk 2/300]***[Become Healthy 1: Drink breast milk 9/300]\u2026\u2026[Become Healthy 1: Drink breast milk 10/300]\u2026\u2026[Become Healthy 1: Drink breast milk 11/300]Despite my efforts, my mother could not sleep at night from the first day. My father had begun work at this time and could not help my mother out.Father\u2026Also, raising babies was solely the mother\u2019s responsibility in this era. My mother never looked anywhere else when she was alone in the house with me.She would wrap me up carefully whenever my limbs would flail out of the blankets even if she dozed. She tried to help me sleep after feeding me and helping me burp.My mother\u2019s daily routine was an endless repeat of feeding me, burping me, and helping me fall asleep. I pretended to fall asleep when my mother wanted me to in order to help her out. She could only sleep for an hour or so during when I pretended to fall asleep.I saw my mother cry for the first time after a week.I heard her wearily weeping, although her silhouette was still vague. Her sobs were the opposite of the bright laughter I had heard with my aunt. My mother had to be at her limits since she had not slept well even once during the week.I was the first and only child, and thus it was the first time my mother had raised a child. She could not go to the bathroom alone, and the maximum amount of sleep for her was an hour at a time.So, she burst into tears, and I realized how difficult it had been for her to raise me.I saw her stop crying to feed me, and around that time, I cared no longer for the quest. It mattered little to my plan, whether I failed my first quest. I could go hungry for a day if it meant my mother could sleep soundly for a day.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, my mother became anxious and called everywhere when I repressed hunger pangs and did not cry out.Twelve times a day every two hours.My mother fed and burped me again as if she had not cried. My ultimate goal was not far away or something in the future.

She worried. She started to worry when I first started shaking, and her expressions of dread reminded me of when I first faced a dungeon. My movements were natural from suppressing pain, but she thought they were from epilepsy or seizures.The doctor comforted my mother, saying that they were a temporary phenomenon resulting from a growth spurt, but she could not help fretting over the trivial things like all mothers.There was no internet, and she had to learn how to take care of a child by herself.I started to cry intentionally after I realized that crying made her worry less than when I trembled silently from growing pains.Last night my mother had massaged my limbs after not being able to get a moment\u2019s sleep because of me, and now it was morning.\u201cI\u2019ll see you soon. Son, your father is leaving now. Honey, I\u2019ll try to come back soon today if possible.\u201dMy father went to work from the early morning, and as always, I could hardly believe I was seeing him again. The memory of being told my father had passed away was still painful in my mind.Then, I realized that I heard my father\u2019s voice clearer than usual, and I could focus on the outlines of the objects in my view. I had grown up more than when I first started the quest, but my babbling was the same. I could only say vowels that were easy to pronounce, no matter how hard I tried. I could say ahh, uhh, ohh, and nothing else.\u201cMy son, are you singing?\u201dWhile I could not bring out the status window, I was satisfied with my mother enjoying herself. My babble gave my mother strength, and she smiled despite being tired to the bone.\u201cI know you came out of my stomach, but you\u2019re too cute. Who do you take after to be cute like this? Yes, yes.\u201dMy mother did not kiss my lips or cheeks, but she found my toes sticking out of the blanket and kissed them multiple times. She then raised her t-shirt naturally and lifted me up.The quest would be completed after this feeding time, and my statistics were also increasing in other ways. This would be due to my growth, as babies around my age developed that much their first month from their mothers\u2019 sacrifices, even if they did not have superhuman abilities.However, points were a different matter, and it was a supernatural ability only the Awakened could accumulate. I sucked at my mother\u2019s breast, and my taste buds were working better than before, along with my sight and hearing.My mother looked at me with loving eyes as I swallowed her milk that tasted of coconuts.[Be healthy 1: Drink breast milk 300/300]I was full and though my lips kept moving from survival instincts, this should stop when I was a bit older.[You completed the quest \u2018Be Healthy.\u2019][Your Health increased by 1.][You have accumulated 3 points.][Total points: 3][Quest \u2018Be Healthy 2\u2019 has started.]***The youngest memory I have was a day in 1988. I was watching the Seoul Olympic opening ceremony on TV, and I held a doll of the Olympic mascot often in family pictures. The only memory I have of 1988 is that single fragment, which felt like an old dream. Therefore, I only heard about what kind of life my parents had from 1985 to 1987.My mother and father were said to have suffered a lot during their honeymoon days, and it was true. We lived in a single room and shared the bathroom with the owner\u2019s family and used their kitchen when they were not using it.It was a day when my mother had been working in the kitchen carrying me on her back. I saw fish cakes and knew today was the day. She had spoken of this day often, that she had stolen a few slices of the owners\u2019 fish cakes because she wanted to eat them so much and did not have the money to buy them during the first few years of marriage.The reason my mother had not forgotten that day was that she had been discovered by the owner\u2019s wife, who had then violently berated her.Things were happening according to history, as my mother glanced around and ate an uncooked slice of fish cake. She seemed to have wanted to eat only one, but her hand instinctively reached for another.I had to cry as best as I could since while it seemed trivial, this day had become a traumatic experience for my mother. I cried out loud, and my mother\u2019s hands reached for me instead.\u201cHey, I\u2019m sorry.\u201dMy mother spoke with a teary voice and rushed out of the kitchen. She met the owner\u2019s wife on the way, but nothing happened. This trivial matter will not change history, and even if it changed, I could live with that for my mother.***The news said that the current president, who was from a military background, visited America with a formal invitation from the American president. My mother could relax a little that month, as my growth spurts died down, and I could keep quiet. Also, my father had given her his first month\u2019s wages.I pretended to sleep as I lay down with my mother as I was being fed until she fell asleep. I stopped sucking from her breast when she started to snore. I twisted my body sideways as much as I could. While my limbs did not work as I wanted them to, I could toss and turn.I turned my body after numerous tries, and finally found space where I could freely move my lips. People said babies started to speak after about eighteen months. However, I had rested enough for the past fifty days to wait that long.I needed to be able to call on the status window more than I needed to control my limbs. My goal was to open the bronze box that was given as a bonus item the first time someone opened their status window.I was fairly certain that the first person to open the status window would have incredible benefits, as the title of being the first always has been. If it was the title of being the first Awakened\u2026However, I only could babble vowels, and my s pronunciations sounded like wind coming out of balloons since I did not have any teeth. However, the System was generous enough, so a perfect accent was not necessary, and I just needed to be understandable. I started practicing again today, next to my sleeping mother.***The television was hectic after my mother turned it on. They were focusing on the results of the summit between South Korea and America, and the news highlighted the scene where details such as having agreed on direct conversations to take place between South Korea and North Korea, were explained to the three party representatives. It was as if the president had been a hero who had achieved greatness, despite the fact the current government was a military dictatorship. It was an era in which our government was continuously growing. The television only stated hopeful news such as the number of domestic registered cars was over a million, or that we had become a country great enough to provide humanitarian aid for our enemy North Korea and poor Ethiopia. The news hid the dark sides of this country, and I could not help but laugh.It was because the history of this time, as well as the state of affairs in Korea or the changes in the world was unreal to me.Humanity had not been prepared at all for the Day of Advent. I had been born and grown up in an era where the Cold War between two ideologies had just ended, and human beings were starting another battle under the name of capitalism.However, our culture had so easily crumbled in the future as we faced supernatural events that were ignored as being unscientific. Our politicians, economists, and financiers all had been useless.The most serious problem was that we had not stopped fighting against each other, and the results were the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues.While there were those who were called heroes, there was no one who could be truly called heroic. The boundaries between good and evil blurred, and those closer to being S classes were considered virtuous, and those far away were considered evil.At least, that was the future to me, and I was not too fond of the idea. After all that, to me, the sight of our president pretending to be solemn and the condescending expression on the American president\u2019s face looked like a children\u2019s play going on in an antique television.Every trace of the lives you people had filled with ambition and greed will fall!\u201cOh, my son!\u201dMy mother seemed to have been surprised at me watching the television so seriously. However, she talked to me often because she had no one to boast of such things, and now the time I had been waiting for came.My mother had fallen asleep feeding me as she always did, but I stayed awake with the television still turned on. Today, I felt something good would happen since I could hold my tongue when it had been like an eel before. It was the result of practicing whenever there was time.I ignored my lisps and focused on completing the words. Status window, status window, status window, and status window. I started again when a vowel sandwiched unintentionally. I finally managed to speak the words, albeit misshapenly.[Name: Sunhoo Na, Characteristics (1)]That was all I could see, and while my Health, Strength, Agility, and Perception statistics had continuously increased, I still had a long way to go before those were added to the status window.[You have received a \u2018bronze box\u2019 as a reward for awakening.]I had expected this much, and the next step was the important one. Please pop up, please![Congratulations! You are the first Awakened!]I had been right and felt jubilant enough almost to scream when I saw the sentence. My small heart was beating so fast that my chest shook, but the next sentence sent chills down my spine.[You have received a \u2018challenger box\u2019 as the reward for being the first awakened.]Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euA challenger box! I knew that the first reward would be amazing, but I had not expected a challenger box. It was a reward all S classes craved in the future, and I had only handled one once. It had given me the chance to go back in time through an astronomical improbability. The time I spent saving points just to open one challenger box was an unimaginable ordeal. A two-month-old baby being given one scared me rather than making me happy.I thought that I perhaps had twisted the System structure, or I had become one of the chosen ones like the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues. However, I was now sure of one thing, and that was the fact I was now First in the Race.Editor: UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A beautiful light spilled through the bronze chest, and the sight made my heart beat faster.Most awakened get their abilities when they open their first box, and bronze boxes tend to hold low-level rewards. However, I was anticipating an increase in stats rather than an ability since I already gained the super S class trait of the Man Who Overcome Adversity. I wanted the Perception stat to increase more than anything else since my infant body needed to develop Perception first.Fortunately, my mother had fallen deeply asleep, so she would not to know of the supernatural events occurring next to her.The chest opened with a whooshing sound.[Your Perception has increased by three.][Current stats: None (4)]Yes! This was what I had hoped! Perception was the stat that increased control over my physical muscles rather than Strength, and therefore necessary for infants. I always felt my limbs try to move out of their own accord when I was wrapped in a blanket. However, now they were composed.This was why I prioritized the status window reward rather than excersizing to grow the muscles in my limbs. Also, there would have been benefits even if Health or Strength had increased instead of Perception. Now, it was time.[The challenger box will be opened.]The challenger box can be opened only once or twice, even for S classes, and none if they were not patient. I clearly saw the beautiful box, and it was a completely different light from the bronze box.A mesmerizing and brilliant light shone as if to light up the entire world, and I had to close my eyes shut. The light of a challenger box was said to be able to heal wounds.I did not have any wounds under my mother\u2019s care, and I should be proud that the light of the challenger box disappeared without any effects.I opened my eyes after bracing myself. It was not an item since the light would have continued to shine if the box had contained one. Then, it would be an ability, a skill, or a stat increase. I would have liked anything else than an item unless the item exceeded S class.***The Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues. They were called by this title in cultures that used Chinese characters, and others called them by different names.While they had many names, one thing was true about them. When they had appeared on the stage, the war with the Unknown had changed to a civil war between human beings.We had not learned much about them, because we were fighting against each other, when studying the System and battling against monster invasions should have been more than enough.They were the sixteen strongest S classes. The eight who followed the System were called virtuous, and the eight who rejected the System were called evil.Just by the fact those who followed the System were called virtuous, it could be seen that the majority followed the System. Anyway, there were many points of conflicting points between them and their viewpoints.The biggest point of contention was the Virtuous said that a supernatural being who was categorized as an absolute good, possibly God, had taken pity on us and gave us abilities in various ways using the System. \u00a0The Evils said the System itself was a cruel trap, tormenting humanity in various and strange ways.Another was that the eight Evils who had denounced the System used it to become stronger. Of course, I belonged to neither groups and actually they had both been my enemies. It was not that I was as strong as them, but I had concluded that the civil war between humanity could only end when they were stopped. There were other events I did not want to remember, and the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues hadn\u2019t even noticed that I had fought them.To them, I had been\u2026 No, I would have been like a mosquito bothering an elephant.I still remembered the Sixth Virtue, who had been a child young enough to boast of his skills but had been strong enough to be one of the Eight Virtues. The name of his main skill had been \u2018Odin\u2019s Wrath.\u2019 It had been a very powerful buff skill that could be utilized in various ways.The reason I had explained about this skill is because this as of yet unborn child\u2019s skill had come out of the challenger box.[You have gained the skill \u2018Odin\u2019s Wrath.\u2019]Amazing!***I had been crying when I woke up, and I realized that I was wailing out loud. It was the day I gained the main skill of someone who had mocked me and completed my first quest as my Perception increased by three and Health by one. While I should have been baking in happiness, my dreams had been nightmarish.I saw the calendar, and the date was May fifteenth. So that was why\u2026\u201cSon, did you have a nightmare?\u201dMy mother looked into me as she lifted me up. She had been so young these days, and the way she smiled with her eyes had been beautiful even when she had become older.No son would have been unable to stop crying when he saw his mother smile down at him like that. My mother praised me that I was the best son ever when I immediately stopped crying. However, the dream that had made me cry was still at the back of my mind.That day had been terrifying for everyone. Up to the moment when the True Nightmares had poured out from the rips in dimensions, the leaders of the powerful nations had announced together that not only could humanity overcome the crisis, but we could control the monsters that came in the early waves.However, I saw the videos in the assembly hall where we had gathered as reserve troops that there were monsters that were vulnerable to our weapons and monsters that were stronger than what modern science could fight. The latter destroyed our culture as we had known it.Their attacks forced countries with nuclear weapons to use them, and my nightmare had been about that day far in the future.We soldiers had been regretful that we could not go to Japan because eastern Japan was contaminated by radioactivity due to the tsunamis in 2011. However, perhaps Japan had hidden them or there had been transactions or pressure, but countries including Japan exploding nuclear weapons in their lands made us wail in despair.The first one to cry had been an old man, and his sobs had made everyone feel the helpless situation humanity now faced. The True Nightmares had survived the nuclear attacks.I remember crying that day until my tears dried, even when I entered the tests, and also as I became an Awakened.***My quests were made to fit my growth process. I received the quest to stand up alone after I finished drinking breast milk, turn over, and sit by myself. I had mentioned that the stats raised by completing quests were those that could be raised by natural growth, and ordinary people could also achieve them.However, the Perception stat raised by the bronze box had made me grow faster than other infants around my age.

It was July seventeenth, 1985, the Korean Constitution Day, and the 140th day since I was born. The man shown on the television now was a deep wound for the 386 generation, who were born during the sixties and were university students during the eighties. He had left a deep mark on all Korean citizens, whether they had participated in the student movements and fought for democracy, or merely looked on.(EN: I think that the author is refering to the June Democracy Movement against President and Dictator Chun Doo-hwan. However, the announcement promising free elections should be in 1987. Please Google for details.)(EN: The 386 Generation is the generation who participated in the Democracy Movement of the 1980\u2019s. A nod to the latest Intel 386 chip, it was in reference to people in their 30\u2019s, who attended university in 1980s and were born in the 1960s.)My father turned off the television with a rigid expression and lifted me. I could not move freely just because I grew faster than others. I had to maintain an appropriate level of development, so that I would not become an international sensation. Therefore, I floundered my limbs and mumbled my pronunciation, despite being able to say recognizable words and stand on my own.\u201cApapa. Abuabu.\u201dMy father worked on weekends but was home today, and my plans to complete the walking alone quest during the morning were squashed. My father held out his forefinger, and I knew what he wanted. Since my survival reflex movements didn\u2019t occur on their own, I intentionally grabbed my father\u2019s finger.\u201cMom! Our son\u2019s strength is amazing!\u201dI felt strange because I had seen my father only a few times in this life. While I was not used to seeing my father in his twenties, I was grateful for it since he was alive now.***I chose the day I was born as the point of my return because of two factors, the trait \u2018The Man who Overcame Adversity\u2019 and the rewards from being the First Awakened. Since I managed to get an S class skill, I began to be dissatisfied with the current situation. It was difficult to pretend I could not do things that I was actually able to do. Therefore, I slept during the day and waited for the night to come. My time began after my father came in drunk and fell asleep late at night.An infant has a high temperature, and my mother had covered me with a light blanket on this hot early summer night. However, I was satisfied that the old electric fan\u2019s creaking sound and my father\u2019s snores were louder than usual since that meant I would be able to move more freely tonight.I quietly crawled out after pushing away the blanket, and I moved like a cat since my mother was right next to me. The first thing I did was to change my diaper, because I could sympathize with babies crying when their diapers were wet, and the sogginess bothered me. While I grew up enough to stand on my own, my small bladder was still a problem. My diaper was already wet despite my mother changing it before she went to sleep.There was a basket for my diapers since my mother washed a day\u2019s worth at a time. Since there were so many, one or two more did not make a difference. I threw the diaper, and it went in the basket. Now was my time, and I had already finished standing up without support. I had marked a place that would not make a noise when I fell, and so I moved to the corner where my parents had stacked the blankets.Seeing a baby change his diaper and practice walking at four months, late at night when everyone was asleep was a creepy rather than a proud sight, and people might feel fear. Since I had time, there was no need to hurry, and I began to practice, not waking my parents the priority. I promised myself that I would fall towards the blankets when I lost my balance. I didn\u2019t pay attention to the time and repeated my movements until my infant body gave out.[Strength is raised by 1 stat.][Sense is raised by 1 stat.][Agility is raised by 1 stat.]This was not due to a quest, this was due to my growth, reaching a level that the increase could be measured and quantified. My grip had become stronger, and I had been feeling more muscle pains recently. I calculated that my senses were the highest because of the reward I had received from the bronze box. In my previous life, I could go against the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues despite my low level because of my abnormally high senses since I had S class senses.However, my weakness was that while I could harass them, I could not meet any of them face to face. My one encounter had been disastrous. My ideal growth was balancing all of my stats and yet maximizing my class advantages (and minimizing my class disadvantages), understanding, and training my traits and skills. An unbalanced growth would be viable only in the short term, and those whose abilities were one-sided were made fun of and then thrown out.I straightened my posture and carefully balanced myself with my arms stretched out like I was on a tightrope. I finally took a step.[Be healthy 5: Walking alone 1/10]Two steps.[Be healthy 5: Walking alone 2/10]Three steps.[Be healthy 5: Walking alone 3/10]However, after the first step, I lost balance and fell with flailing arms, just missing the blankets. I hope my mother did not wake up.***I failed in completing the Walking Alone quest that day since I managed only to take four steps when the mission was ten. I crawled to my mother\u2019s arms and buried my head against her breasts. This was something I could do only now, and my mother liked me snuggling against her. So, it was part of my filial duties.***I took ten perfect steps the next night.[You have finally completed the quest arc \u2018Be Healthy\u2019.][Your strength increased by 1 stat.][You have received twenty points.][Accumulated points: 32]A light burst.[Congratulations, you have fulfilled the growth conditions necessary for independence.][You have received a \u2018bronze box\u2019 as your completion reward.]I read the message over and over again. Another bronze box? While the bronze box was the lowest grade, it still took three hundred points to get one, and so it should not be this easy. My mind went blank from surprise, and I realized that I had been wrong.I had thought that the Man who Overcame Adversity trait had made him the strongest individual alive since the trait was an SSS rank cheat that made S class skills into SS class skills. However, I realized that the Man who Overcame Adversity trait had been only a part of his strengths. It was an amazing advantage to start quests before the Day of Reckoning because of the plentiful time and the fact that the quests were aligned with a person\u2019s growth process. I could accept that a challenger box reward was given for being the first awakened, but the bronze box that sprang out as a quest reward now was beyond my comprehension. The quests were simply part of the natural part of human growth, but the reward was a box worth three hundred points.If the beginning was like this, who knew what would happen in the future? It had not been a coincidence that he had been the strongest since the Day of Reckoning.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu[The bronze box has been opened.][Your strength increased by 3.]I had planned to remove him before the Day of Reckoning, but now it became clearer.

Thank you very muchI could say that I was a baby easy to handle, as I slept deeply in the day and did not cry for no reason at night. However, I existed because of my parents\u2019 sacrifice for me over a long period before my return. As every child does, I had made my parents suffer for my sake.I had nearly died from swallowing a piece of apple when I was a year old and made my parents worry because I did not talk until four, and had been hospitalized for more than two months because an autocycle had hit me. Of course, I did not remember any of that, and my mother had told me all these incidents. Things I remembered from my childhood were mostly about my \u2018firsts\u2019 rather than my wounds and illnesses.Those memories were fragmented like an old picture, like when I watched fireworks with my cousin, the first day I went to play at a friend\u2019s house, and the first day I went to visit my grandfather at the hospital. I did not remember once about my parents\u2019 sacrifices, which made me realize how selfish a child could be.***\u201cMom, mom, mom.\u201dThis was the first time I said the word to my mother. It was not meaningless mumbles, and I spoke with our eyes meeting each other. While my mother could not know, this was for me, having made her worry that I could not talk until I was four. The biggest reason, however, was because of a quest.[Let\u2019s grow up 1: \u2018Mom\u2019 successful.][You have completed the quest \u2018Let\u2019s grow up 1.\u2019][You have received 5 points.][Accumulated points: 37]My mother seemed not to care whether I called her intentionally, or I was mumbling, and she just enjoyed the moment. She lifted me and walked with me in her arms for a while before setting me down on the floor. The new compound quest was about linguistic development, which was amusing because it underestimated a returner like me. Except for my pronunciation, which was not yet complete due to my lack of teeth and thick tongue, I did not have any language skill problems.My next mission was to speak sixteen words, which is a piece of cake. Quests I had to risk my life for was now only milestones in my development. The everyday quests I was used to were not like this since there were big risks. Moreover, I gained five points for completing this quest when I had received two points for disposing of an F class monster. To think that moving my lips a few times with a body like this would have more than double the effect of killing an F class monster. I honestly could not hide my joy.***This would be the final quest of the compound quest \u2018Let\u2019s grow up.\u2019[Let\u2019s grow up 5 (Quest) Mission: Choose a particular individual and communicate in more than ten sentences.]My father was on a business trip, and I could not use my mother as a sacrifice for my quest. I first thought of the owner\u2019s wife, as she was a jealous and a mean person. She gave birth to a son, her third child, about the same time I was born. Therefore, she could not help comparing her son and me when there was a chance.She scared my mother that I would become a harelip if I were quiet, and if I spoke out anything in response, she would denounce me, saying that I had a ghost who died because it could not speak. She was someone who one could not stand and would even enjoy my mother looking uncomfortable.There was another reason why that woman had to be my choice, and that was because she was a firm believer in shamanism. I had seen many talismans on my mother\u2019s back, including ones on the front door, in the kitchen, and on the way to the owner\u2019s floor.I stood in front of the door that led to the front yard. Everything was big to a child\u2019s gaze, and a simple door looked big as a massive and oppressive gate. The door would not open just by pushing, and I had to push after turning the doorknob and removing the spoon-shaped locking device set through the rings. I could see the spoon-shaped device and the doorknob by fully tilting my neck back. I could not reach them by jumping up and down with my arm outstretched.My small heart began to beat faster, and I felt like when I had entered a dungeon. My spine chilled, thinking that my mother might be watching me. I looked around to find something to step on, and my gaze focused on the hard pillows piled in the corner of the room.It was past midnight, and a suitable day since the owner was absent like my father. Jindol, the dog tied to a post in the front yard, wagged its tail when I appeared. The dog looked different from when I could look down on it from my mother\u2019s back.The large beast\u2019s eyes glistened under the moonlight, and it would be me overthinking things that Jindol\u2019s lead looked slacker than usual. The moment the lead broke or Jindol got loose, the dog would be like a boss monster in the wild mountains of Hwasung to me.Wait. I thought of something, and my original plan had been completing the quest to the owner\u2019s wife by pretending to be a child\u2019s ghost and edify her nature in the process. However, why had I only thought of talking to an adult?It would be Chuseok when I would meet my cousin, who was four and would be able to speak. Chuseok was not far away to proceed with a plan that had the risk of waking my mother up.***\u201cWhy is my baby not smiling today? Are you shy, son?\u201dI wanted to nod and wanted to give Odin\u2019s wrath to my aunts who were playing with my genitals. There were many babies on Chuseok, and since my younger cousins were not born yet, everyone was older than me.Jiae, one of my cousins, walked towards me. She was born three years earlier than me and was already pretty. While she did not like the small mole under her left eye, that was her charm. Her mole, vivid eyes, and a\u00a0sharp nose reminded me of how she would look like as an adult. My aunts moved so Jiae could come near me because they were curious how cute we would look during our first meet.Jiae had beauty, the merits of being a graduate of a prestigious university, and the title of becoming a prosecutor after passing the bar exam. She had a golden future who would be the pride of the family, but Jiae would become missing on the Day of Reckoning and must have been attacked by a monster.I wanted to advise my aunt to encourage Jiae to take up sports instead of studying, even if she showed great talent in the latter. While her physical abilities would not guarantee her survival, but it would be an important factor. At the very least, her experience as a prosecutor did not help Jiae.People would need to train their bodies at least before the Day of Reckoning or have to go through intense warlike experiences.\u201cHe\u2019s your brother, and please play and look after him like an older sister.\u201dJiae\u2019s mother put our hands together, but she hugged me instead and rubbed my hair this way and that with rough hands that were unused to holding a baby.\u201cHello, Sunhoo.\u201dShe had a cute voice, and I also gently whispered to her year.\u201cHi, sis.\u201dJiae\u2019s hand stopped moving in surprise. My mother and her other relatives were focused on other babies at that moment, and I quickly told her that I could only talk with her and not to call other adults. It was that moment when I finished the quest with cute sentences with Jiae.[You have finally completed the compound quest \u2018Let\u2019s grow up.\u2019][You have received a \u2018silver box\u2019 as the first completion reward.]What?[Congratulations.

I knew where I was the moment my vision cleared, and I was in a classroom. A young male teacher was teaching English in front of young students. I held a mechanical pencil in my hand, and an incomplete scribble was drawn on my notebook.I saw that my English textbook was for middle school first graders. I was sitting alone near the window at the back of the classroom. I had always sat in the middle when I had been a student, and the past had been slightly changed.\u201cStatus Window.\u201d[Name: Sunhoo Na. Health: F (2) Strength: F (20) Agility: F (13) Perception: F (20) Accumulated Points: 87. Properties (1)]I had F class on all my stats. While a person with these stats would be considered an ordinary person after the Day of Reckoning, it was not bad at all by current standards. My body was that of an average adult male, and my strength and perception were above some athletes.The stats I had increased during the tutorial must have affected the time I skipped. The past had changed. My arm was long and full of hard muscles way above the middle school level, and I could feel the power in my biceps and fascia.I was clenching my fist when my eyes fell on the scribble in my notebook. I had thought that I, as an ordinary middle school student, had merely been passing the time, but the drawing depicted an F class monster. The monster was a beast type and one that walked on two legs. Its Identification number was KF-07, and the number was clearly written in the upper part of the note in a messy scribble that looked like mine. K was for Korea, F was the monster\u2019s level, and 07 was an arbitrarily given numeric identifier. Actually, Korean awakened called them \u2018Guard Dogs.\u2019I thought of something, and it proved to be true. The previous page of the notebook I flipped back noted an address of a mountain in the Gyeonggi Province and its price.***I guessed that I had lived the life of a returner during the skipped time, and that was why I had trained and prepared to conquer an F class dungeon. I would first have to buy the lands where the dungeon lay before releasing its seal. I ran home right after the classes ended, and our family lived in the Miari area at this time.The house was as I remembered, and the key was in the milk basket. I opened the locked door and managed to remember that Mother had been working at the local curtain shop around this period.I was much too excited about finding out how much I had been preparing during the skipped period to think more about my childhood memories.A picture that looked like it was taken at my elementary graduation ceremony last year was framed in the living room. I was already completely grown by this time, and it would be credible to believe that this picture was for someone \u00a0graduating high school.I was relieved to see that my parents looked happy in the picture. As I entered my room, I saw that it was definitely not one for a teenager. Even if I did not remember how my room had been in middle school, it was evident that the room was different from my past life.The blankets were folded with military precision by me, and my desk didn\u2019t have \u00a0a speck of dust. I searched my room everywhere and looked wherever I would hide something like zip drives and floppy disks. (EN: Remember, this was the \u201890s)However, it seemed that my physical growth and my changed relationship with other students due to the former seemed to have been all that had been changed in the past. I seemed to have just begun to plan how to conquer a dungeon about now, and I sort of agreed to that sentiment. I should have been close to my parents, at least until elementary school.Now, the real me will be the one who oversees the proceedings.***While I had not bought the sealed dungeon area or had been earning money, choosing the mountain in Hwasung, Gyeonggi Province, as my first conquest, had been a wise choice. I could guess how I had searched the market price, but since I would have destroyed all traces like bus receipts, I gave up on that route.The first area was a large mountain about 1300 million won, and an F class sealed dungeon was waiting there until the Day of Reckoning. I had many things to prepare, such as buying the mountain and installing security systems. They all cost money. (EN: 2.5 million US in 2020)Since I knew the past, earning money would not be difficult. However, while the 500,000 won I had saved during my skipped period may be adequate capital, a minor can only make a minors\u2019 stock account, which forbade speculative transactions such as future options transactions. Even if I managed to establish a corporation, it would be difficult to make the investments I was aiming for, and that meant I desperately needed a proxy. I thought of several names, Jonathan, Gillian, Cheongsoo Kim, Jessica, and others. (EN: About $1000 US in 2020. Amazing, he has a thousand dollars in Elementary School\u2026)There was only one person I could trust, and that was Jonathan.***He would be a young man at twenty-five in Wall Street. Jonathan had reminisced that he and his comrades at that time were the \u2018Wolves at Wall Street\u2019 because the financial company he worked for had the word Wolf in it. 1997 was a year when the internet was still in its infancy, and it was the first time that websites were being created.I searched a financial company that included the word Wolf in its name at Wall Street, and I found a link on the American search engine APE. The internet was extremely slow, and the picture of the employees appeared at crawling speed. Since Jonathan had been at the bottom ranks at the time, his picture came last. I saw a younger Jonathan smiling amid the picture that showed up bit by bit.Jonathan looked like he was saying that he was a Wall Street elite, and the rage and despair of a man who had lost everything were not there. I sent an email.-Hello, Jonathan. I have sent this email to ask your opinion on whether the Thailand baht is being exchanged for an overvalued price at the present.***Jonathan had often boasted of his role in the 1997 Asian financial crisis that had brought the IMF to Korea. He had said the best time of his life had been 1997, and even as he had attained the title of an A class hunter that everyone had wanted, his nostalgia for the past could be heard whenever he talked about that time.I was certain that Jonathan would take the bait, as he had been anxious at the time being convinced that the Global Hedge Funds would attack the Thailand baht first. If he had made more aggressive investments from the beginning because he believed himself, the best time of his life would have been Epic.However, he had been unable to do so since Jonathan had been playing catch-up before 1997.-The Thailand baht is not overvalued.I saw his reply in my Inbox before going to sleep.-I apologize. I thought that if the Thailand baht was overvalued, it would be a justification.The reply came back immediately as if he had been waiting for my answer.-Please inform me who you are and which firm you belong to.I expected this, and his bite on my fishhook was strong.-Aren\u2019t there other conditions that could be used as justification? The Asian foreign exchange reserves and the dollar\u2019s continuing strength would be easy solutions to the Hedge Funds consortium\u2019s problems. I expect that they will be attacking the Thailand baht this month, but their ultimate goal will not be Thailand. If they do attack, this would only be the beginning.***Jonathan was astonished. It had begun with an email from nowhere.\u201cThailand would only be the beginning\u2026\u201dThe sender was certain that the Hedge Funds would attack the Thailand baht and even included the names of the most likely ones. Jonathan held his head after looking across the cubicles. His colleagues were all busy, and come to think of it, this situation did not warrant someone else\u2019s advice. It was an opportunity.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe fact that large amounts of investment funds had poured into the Hedge Funds mentioned in the reply was no longer a secret. Those who worked in Wall Street estimated that where those funds would go next would change the entire situation. Therefore, Wall Street was tense nowadays, and this email had come during this wait.Jonathan focused on the fact the sender had used the word \u2018justification.\u2019 Only someone that knew what was going on in this field could use that word in this context. He was more curious about where this mail was coming from than who was sending it. This may be a test. Jonathan breathed deeply and put his hands over the keyboard.-My office is open, and I will be waiting. If you cannot visit me, you can reach me at\u2026Jonathan\u2019s hands shook as if he had seen a ghost.Editor: UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I intentionally did not answer him back even as the Sammi Group, ranked 26th, filed bankruptcy after the Hando Group on the same day. Of course, I read the emails Jonathan sent me.-I do not know when you will check this email. The attack on the Thailand baht you have mentioned seems to have started. Please conact me as soon as you see this, as I have something interesting to show you.I could see that Jonathan was still hesitating by this email. If he was going to dive into the currency war with confidence, he would not send me an email like this. He would establish his own investment corporation and would be busy day and night funding investments through the connections he had made up to this day.However, during the Asian financial crisis, Jonathan would jump in August when the battlefield had already moved to Hong Kong. While he had a sharp eye, he lacked financial power. On the other hand, Jonathan had achieved what he called the best time of his life because he was so skillful. I mean to say that even I would have a tough fight against him if he had begun to move as soon as he was \u00a0certain that the Hedge Funds were attacking the Thailand baht.It took about fifty days in 1992 for a Hedge Fund to break the English pound on Black Wednesday. Therefore, he and others would position themselves on the assumption that the Thailand baht would also be brought down the same way by the Hedge Funds, but the baht would not fall to a single strike. Thailand would hold the advantage at one point and cause massive damage to the Hedge Funds during the protracted struggle. However, the Thailand baht would crumble on July 2nd, which is more than three months from now.Anyway, I checked the investment product that Jonathan had attached in the email, and it was what I had thought. The product had bet on the Thailand baht falling in May. It basically said that \u2018the Hedge Funds would finish the battle within fifty days like in 1992 and would emerge as glorious winners.\u2019 This Investment Product could be said to symbolize the atmosphere of Wall Street at present. (EN: Investment product is the umbrella term for all the stocks, bonds, options, derivatives and other financial instruments that people put money into in hopes of earning profits. )-Please contact me if there is a product that bet on the Thailand baht increasing.Jonathan seemed to have been constantly refreshing his Inbox despite his busy schedule, and the reply came back in less than ten minutes.-Have you not been predicting that the Thailand baht will fall?-I\u2019ll make a suggestion. If you would establish your own investment corporation, I\u2019ll provide my investment proposal. I expect 51 percent of the corporation shares.***The investment product Jonathan had sent to Sunhoo was given to only a few VVIPs. While Jonathan had taken on a large gamble, the result was disappointing enough that he could not even sigh.\u2018Come to think of it, while the email had mentioned that the Thailand baht would be attacked, it did not mention that the attackers would win. Yes, there was no mention of it.\u2019The attack on the Thailand baht would succeed without fail. Jonathan and the entirety of all the corporations on Wall street agreed that Thailand would not last after being chosen as the Hedge Funds\u2019 prey. How could Thailand last when England failed? That was Wall Street\u2019s honest opinion.However, Jonathan had been disappointed by the last sentence. How could someone request 51 percent for an investment proposal?\u2018A swindler got me\u2026what had I been expecting?\u2019Jonathan furrowed his brow and grabbed his phone. He had wasted a lot of time because of an unknown scam email. Now was the time to call the VVIPs (Very Very Important Persons) before he lost big accounts to other firms or colleagues. Wall Street had already finished betting.However, Jonathan lowered the phone again. He felt like he was missing something, and if he could not figure it out, he continued to think about it.Jonathan\u2019s keyboard made aggressive sounds. His performance was low, all the more because his travel date was approaching.-On what grounds do you believe that the Hedge Funds will fail?Jonathan bit his nails without realizing as he waited for the reply. The answer came.-I seem to have caused another misunderstanding. I am not saying that the Hedge Funds will lose, but the Thailand Bank will use many protective measures in May. Malaysia\u2019s Negara Bank in 1994 is a prime example, and the reciprocal agreement the Thailand Bank made with ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)\u00a0central banks in 1995 and the dual exchange rate system still remain viable options. Therefore, my conclusion is that Thailand baht will rise for a short period.(EN: A dual exchange rate is a setup created by a government where their currency has a fixed official exchange rate and a separate floating rate applied to specified goods, sectors or trading conditions. The floating rate is often market-determined in parallel to the official exchange rate.)Jonathan actually let out a gasp and the shock that spread through him made him completely forget his initial disappointment. While he looked like he was sitting without moving a muscle, his brain was whirring like never before. He thought that he could hear his neurons firing one by one in slow motion.\u2018It, it is possible!\u2019Jonathan\u2019s eyes caught the investment product manual for the VVIPs, which had bet on the baht price falling in May. His colleagues were doing their best to sell this product, since everyone assumed the outcome was a given, this was a sweet opportunity for them to increase performance and build trust with VVIPs. The empty pages here and there were those of colleagues who had already quit to establish their own firms. If the baht does not fall in May, they would be beggars.Jonathan gulped. Should he notify the board that this scenario may be possible and strongly suggest that the risk should be minimized?He thought things over for a while and then typed with shaking fingers.-We have no investment products that have bet on the Thailand baht rising, and unfortunately, we have no plans to develop such a product.-That is why I am suggesting you establish your own firm.-A 51 percent share without conditions means that you will control my future and capital. It is too much. Who would sign such a contract?-Think things over. My offer stands until the end of May.-Should we not talk in person? As I said, my office is always open.That was the end. Their communication ceased even after Jonathan sent his second email saying he would be willing to travel to meet in person.***When the Hedge Funds decided to conquer the Thailand baht, the baht falling was considered a given. However, reality said otherwise. Even as the Hedge Funds continued to attack the Thailand baht, it would not budge. Therefore, Jonathan\u2019s company was tense as it had focused on selling the investment product that bet on the Thailand baht falling.Jonathan had been the only fund manager that had not sold the product, and the firm wanted him out and away from the VVIPs. While Jonathan had not bet actual money like others, he was betting something even more. Jonathan had bet his record and future as a fund manager. Even his clerk criticized Jonathan and asked to leave him.Jonathan felt like he lived in another world on May 14th\u00a0and 15th, as he was alone in his office. Those were the days the Hedge Funds had attacked the Thailand baht with everything they had.It had been enough for a fall, and Jonathan\u2019s colleagues had been shouting screams of joy in excitement. However, as time passed, their joy turned to something else\u2026\u201cDamn! Damn!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s insane! This cannot be happening!\u201dThe entire office erupted in chaos. The phones did not stop ringing, and Jonathan\u2019s colleagues were red-faced as they screamed out.\u201cJonathan!\u201dJonathan\u2019s clerk came in, running through the door, and his face was full of surprise.\u201cYou were right! The baht is rising! How can this be\u2026\u201dThe clerk showed Jonathan the record of the ASEAN central banks aiding Thailand by 120 million dollars.\u201cThey are scared stiff that there will be a loss of at least 3 million.\u201d\u201cAll right, leave.\u201d\u201cCan, can I do anything?\u201dJonathan did not even look at his clerk as he waved his hand. He was about to faint from relief and also did not want to face anyone who had looked down on him and laughed. The two months he had spent being criticized and despised as a coward had felt like forever. One of Jonathan\u2019s colleagues showed his head through the door.\u201cHarry wants you.\u201dJonathan became exhausted at the jealous gaze. Harry was the largest shareholder of this company and its main trainer. While Jonathan did not want to see anyone, he wanted to see the face Harry would be making.There were three VVIPs in Harry\u2019s office, with whom Harry had worked for a long time, and they had suffered big losses due to this incident. Harry planned to introduce Jonathan as the company\u2019s new hope to assuage their anger and overcome this crisis.However, that was Harry\u2019s idea. Jonathan handed his name card to the clients after entering Harry\u2019s office before speaking.\u201cI\u2019m going to establish a new investment firm after leaving Wolf, and my contact address will not change. If you want an investment consultation\u2026\u201d\u201cJonathan!\u201dHarry hurriedly took Jonathan out of the office.\u201cWhy? Didn\u2019t you want me to go? I\u2019m doing what you wanted me to.\u201d\u201cWhere? Do you already have a sponsor?\u201d\u201cI do now. Everyone in Wall Street knows that I\u2019m the only one without damage, and what I had bet on was this.\u201d\u201cYou think succeeding once will get you anywhere?\u201d\u201cWhen did Wall Street ever need a second success?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJonathan smiled faintly, and Harry\u2019s shouts behind him did not interest him anymore. He returned to the office amidst jealous and envious gazes. While he was organizing his things, there was one thing he needed to do.-I quit my job, which means that I\u2019ll agree to your terms. I must be going insane. Let\u2019s talk about specifics in person.

    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayPast Life Returner 9I was bored reliving my middle school life. The joy I felt at seeing my friends, who I had almost forgotten, lasted only a day. My grown physique was the center of attention in this school, and thanks to that, my life went on without much incident. The seniors, let alone my classmates left me alone. I was already about six feet despite being a first-grader in middle school, and I could not help being more interested in the teachers\u2019 adult lives rather than the young students.It was break time, and I saw that the staff room window was full of people as I passed by. Male teachers were talking about stocks as they smoked, and their expressions looked better than yesterday. Even as major firms such as Hando, Sammi, and Chamro were going bankrupt, their ruin had not affected the teaching profession yet. Therefore, the currency war starting from Thailand would not affect them at all. It was enough for them that the stock they had bought the day before was rising.I heard that the bell signaling that break time was over, and students began to run to their classrooms. The corridors emptied in an instant, and at first felt strange and awkward at the sight. However, things had not changed after two months, and the silent corridor made me think of things I would rather not, like my memories of a city where all of its citizens lay dead\u2026***I headed to Gimpo Airport after school, as Jonathan was scheduled to arrive at seven o\u2019clock in the evening. I waited at the entry place with a small sign that had Jonathan\u2019s name (in english) on it. Since I had already seen his younger picture on the website and from our emails, I thought that I would not be surprised at how young he looked. However, that was not the case. Jonathan was not wearing the protective gear he had gotten from a silver box and instead wore a black suit, and instead of an iron club, he came in holding a 007 bag. (EN: Bags inspired or modeled after the Bond movies) \u00a0Eyes only possible in a peaceful world looked up and down at me and my sign.Jonathan did not have a grave expression like his picture, and his skin had a sheen. It seems the long flight had not been stressful, as he must have had good dreams as he flew over the Pacific to meet me.\u201cI\u2019m Jonathan.\u201dHe approached me and spoke. It was the first time I heard a lively voice and saw hopeful eyes on my old friend\u2026\u201cLet\u2019s go somewhere else to talk. Please, follow me.\u201dI spoke fluent English, and he looked a bit surprised at that. I had found an unpopular restaurant in the airport, and Jonathan\u2019s confident footsteps followed me from behind as I led the way. He must be thinking that he would meet the individual that had sent him the email there, and it was a logical assumption. How could he think that a young teen like me with a backpack had sent him those emails?Jonathan must be thinking of a stereotypical elite Asian guy, with a round face and gelled hair. He would be thinking that the man would be wearing a slightly larger suit than his frame, wipe his glasses, and ask Jonathan for a handshake after meeting him.However, there was no one where I had led Jonathan, and I sat across the table from him. Jonathan blinked and even shrugged as if to ask what was going on.\u201cI sent you those emails, Jonathan. Thank you for coming all the way here to meet me.\u201d (EN: No honorifics. \u00a0I think the author was making the point that Jonathan was Sunhoo\u2019s friend in his past life, and following American societal norms, by using his first name, he\u2019s making Jonathan think Sunhoo is fairly close to his own age. \u00a0And Jonathan forgot this was Asia, so he didn\u2019t notice all the flags going off when Sunhoo left out honorifics. \u00a0Silly Jonathan.)Jonathan stared at me for a long time and covered his face with his hands. He sighed in despair. He did not move his hand as he stared at me through his fingers.\u201cI came here to bet everything on your prank. Do you know what you just did?\u201dJonathan did not raise his voice, but I could see how angry he was only by his eyes. I knew them. He had those eyes as he glared at the monsters and mumbled that he would survive.Jonathan stood up without saying a word and looked down at me. I felt the rage in his eyes, something that would kick me down and beat me until I stopped breathing.\u201cDoes Wall Street judge people by their age?\u201dI answered, and that was when the waiter went back after coming to check our orders. This atmosphere was too tense.\u201cHow old are you, eighteen? Twenty?\u201d\u201cSomeone will call the police if you continue to stare at me like that.\u201dI nodded to the counter, as the restaurant manager and the waiter were whispering about us there.\u201cYou can go back, but it\u2019s courtesy to give a gift to a guest who has flown across the ocean to come here.\u201dI took out an investment draft proposal I had written last night from the bag and handed it to Jonathan. He grabbed it out of my hands not to confirm the contents but to rip it apart in front of me. He gripped it with both hands to rip it apart before suddenly stopping because his fiercely glaring eyes noticed the chart on the report. I spoke again.\u201cPlease sit down.\u201d***\u201cToday\u2019s Asian financial crisis was inevitable as soon as the American government had let Asian countries borrow an infinite amount of American Dollars. They spoke of how the twenty-first century will be Asia\u2019s and created the legend of the Four Asian Tigers. The hedge funds only placed their spoons in that.\u201d\u201cSpoons?\u201dI used the spoon I was holding to mimic eating some food, and Jonathan nodded as he understood. He turned back to read my report from the beginning again.\u201cHow is Wall Street?\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dJonathan replied in a distracted manner. However, the most important points were missing from the report no matter how many times he went over it.I only showed the big forest in the chart, and the roots and branches were hidden beneath the leaves. The dates were missing.\u201cThe trends will flow like that.\u201dI pointed to where the chart dipped again.\u201cYou won\u2019t tell me the dates until I sign? Well, you think that the attackers will be able to break the bhat.\u201d\u201cJonathan, you\u2019re from Wall Street. Have you seen anything like this situation before seeing my report?\u201dJonathan was unable to answer easily, and he would not be the only one. This was the day after the Thailand government had punched out the hedge funds, and the battle that had been considered one-sided now became uncertain.That would be how Wall Street felt now, and it would last until the Thailand government announced their surrender on the coming July second.Jonathan quieted down and flipped through the report. It was not difficult for me to piece together the process when I already knew the results. The traces of fierce battles occurring in the Thailand foreign currency market and the New York currency market were in the report, and I had organized the numerous charts and graphs to point to a single path.It took less time than I had expected for Jonathan to arrive at a conclusion.\u201cThe attackers will win if a certain condition is met\u2026\u201dJonathan stared at me, and it was clear he wanted to test me.\u201cI\u2019m not the one that should be answering, Jonathan. You should, so I can decide whether you are someone I can work with.\u201dJonathan laughed at that, and his face looked even refreshed now.\u201cIsn\u2019t my money, my record, and my time not enough for you?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s enough if you want to step back from management, from being my true partner. Will you?\u201dJonathan smiled as if he considered the question one that did not deserve an answer.\u201cI have bet everything. What are you betting?\u201d\u201cOpportunity cost. How much do you think I would have earned if I had chosen someone else? Even as we speak, I\u2019m losing money I could earn.\u201d (EN: the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen. \u00a0\u201cidle cash balances represent an opportunity cost in terms of lost interest\u201d.)Jonathan stopped himself from replying, as he also knew the situation. Since everyone at Wall Street had bet on the baht falling, he knew that I could have earned an astronomical amount of money by betting on the opposite side.\u201cHaven\u2019t you decided yet?\u201d\u201cI need some time to think. In spite of everything, you\u2019re\u2026something else.\u201d\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll wait until June third.\u201dI stood up.\u201cHey, wait. Why June third?\u201dJonathan also hurriedly stood up and even blocked me as if I would disappear like a ghost. His eyes followed my gaze to the report he was holding. He flipped the pages with a shout and put the report out to show me my estimated short-term baht exchange rate chart. Jonathan\u2019s finger pointed to where the chart fell, where the short-term baht uptrend stopped. Since no one knew when the baht would stop rising in this situation, me telling him the exact date stunned him.\u201cThis is June second, right?\u201d\u201cNow, you only need to calculate how much we will lose until the date.\u201d\u201cYou can guess trends, but not dates. Unless you\u2019re a god.\u201dJonathan spoke firmly.\u201cWell, then you just might have met one.\u201d\u201cDamn! I met a lot of people, but someone like you\u2026\u201d\u201cYou have until June third, and if you cannot decide on then, I\u2019ll think that our relationship is over.\u201d***Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIt was June third, and a mail arrived after a long lull.-What do you think our company\u2019s name should be?Editor: UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Later on, in the same restaurant, his gaze went back to the now useless investment draft proposal, which had only covered until the baht exchange rate started to fall.-June secondWhile Jonathan had highlighted the date with a red pen, he had been unable to use the chance.\u201cHow could you have known the date, even if you predicted the trends?\u201d\u201cCalculation.\u201d\u201cWill you show them to me in the future?\u201dJonathan\u2019s eyes shone.\u201cI\u2019ll let you hear the ingredients.\u201dThe hedge funds were planning a counterattack by borrowing on the Japanese yen, which had a low-interest rate. Since this was already known, I felt no need to speak of it.\u201cOnly the ingredients? How about the recipe?\u201dJonathan had completely changed his attitude in the past few days. \u00a0He acted like a young man raised in the country who just had his first look at the lights of the big city rather than a successful financial manager in Wall Street. As I did not know what Jonathan\u2019s personality was like when he was young, I could only understand and let him be. I smiled silently, and Jonathan left it at that since he still had his pride as a manager.\u201cI still don\u2019t know your name, and that should be corrected.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Sunhoo.\u201d\u201cSun, who. It\u2019s not bad. Can I call you Sun?\u201dIn my first life, Jonathan had shown me his bright side only twice, and they were when he boasted of his prime in 1997 and after he had cleared a dungeon, surviving to the end. He was like a wounded beast at other times. He would drink whenever there was no work and called out his daughter\u2019s name when he had nightmares of his deceased family. Compared to that, this younger Jonathan, still retained his bright personality. Since I remembered how he had looked the last time I saw him in my past life, I liked seeing him smile like this now.\u201cJonathan and Sun Investment.\u201dJonathan spoke suddenly about the name of the company we were about to establish.\u201cThe shares are 51 to 49, so my name is first. It would not be wrong to say it would be my company.\u201d\u201cRemove my name out of it.\u201dI spoke.\u201cYou seem to be past the age of being coy.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care about the company name. How much capital?\u201d\u201cSun, you\u2019re too wily, which is why you succeeded in this crazy deal. I will fund the capital and hand you 49 percent of the shares.\u201d\u201cI need 51 percent.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIf you don\u2019t like that, I don\u2019t care how little capital you fund.\u201d\u201cEven if it\u2019s just ten thousand dollars?\u201d\u201cAs you wish.\u201d\u201cWhere does that confidence come from?\u201d\u201cWill it be ten thousand dollars then?\u201dJonathan held out four fingers and spoke on.\u201cFour hundred thousand dollars. While I want more, that\u2019s all I have.\u201dSince I have a 51 percent share, I have gotten a little more than two hundred thousand dollars for free.\u201cDon\u2019t you have any funds to help, Sun?\u201d\u201cIf I did, I wouldn\u2019t have called you to Korea.\u201d\u201cWhy was it me? How did you know me?\u201d\u201cFrom the website.\u201d\u201c\u2026Only a website? You didn\u2019t care who it was \u00a0as long as you could establish an investment firm in America?\u201dAn investment firm in America? I wanted to start one from a tax haven if possible. However, considering Jonathan\u2019s savings, I could not.\u201cAre you disappointed?\u201d\u201cNo, I just think that opportunities come strangely. It never came when I desperately wanted one.\u201dIt never came when I desperately wanted one.The words felt like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu. When Jonathan had opened a master box with the points he had accumulated after risking his life and nearly dying several times, he had given up on life. He first had a grand plan of not opening any boxes below a challenger box until he had enough points. However, after a series of events that cornered him mentally, he had opened a master box.Therefore, he had wanted an item instead of a skill or a trait from the master box. If I think back to what Jonathan had said, he seemed to have been planning to sell it and live like crazy in the red-light district until he died.However, a miracle happened to him, as a skill at the level of a challenger box came out of the master box. That was the second time I had seen something of a higher level come out of a lower box. Only twice. Not even one of the luckiest men I had ever seen had managed to do this, and it was on that day Jonathan had walked away to seek his revenge despite my trying to stop him. That was the last memory I had of him, and I heard of his death by rumors.***\u201cWhy are you looking at me like that? Are you honored that I acknowledge you as an \u2018opportunity?\u2019 From what you have shown me, you\u2019re my chance. My own Sun. I only need one since I\u2019m ready for it.\u201dI saw Jonathan\u2019s excited face after coming back from my memories.\u201cWill you bet everything you have if I said to go all-in?\u201d\u201cAll-in?\u201dJonathan smiled with meaning.\u201cJust because I changed the investment product doesn\u2019t mean that I stopped being a trader. I invested in you, which means that I\u2019ll give you all I have.\u201dJonathan placed his 007 suitcase on the table with a loud thump, and documents that warranted the sound came out of it. Those were documents needed to establish an investment firm, and he had already signed wherever he needed to. Jonathan had to be the initiator and the CEO since he was an American citizen. He needed my official documents from the Korean government to prove my identity, like my resident registration certificate.Jonathan\u2019s brow furrowed deeply, seeing it, and he stared at me in confusion. I pointed at my name.[Sunhoo Na (850228 \u2013 *******)\u201cThat\u2019s the only document that will prove my citizenship. That\u2019s my name, and those two are my parents\u2019 names.\u201d\u201cWhat are the numbers?\u201d\u201cThey are the Korean equivalent of social security numbers, and they are called resident registration numbers. Proceed with this. I\u2019ll send you my passport as soon as it\u2019s issued.\u201d\u201cHey Sun, this number. That\u2019s not your date of birth, right?\u201d\u201cIt is.\u201d\u201c85 does not mean 1985, right?\u201dJonathan asked in surprise. A long time passed during which he simply could not speak from the shock. He needed me to confirm something unbelievable\u2026\u201cYou\u2019re thirteen? Thirteen?\u201dJonathan was surprised on two accounts. His co-founder was thirteen, and he already looked like he had finished growing. Jonathan covered his face with one hand like the day he had met Sunhoo, but the eyes peeking through his fingers were different this time. Actually, a bigger thrill than his initial anger burned in them.\u201cSo, you\u2019re an Asian genius.\u201d***Jonathan had evaluated my preparedness and tenacity, but now, he thought of my genius as my best asset. The young Asian financial genius. Jonathan looked at me like a westerner who traveled to Tibet and Japan to chase an . While I would have liked to punch him in the eyes, I threw a date instead of a punch.\u201cThe second week of June, from the ninth to the thirteenth.\u201dJonathan\u2019s posture changed as I spoke of actual dates.\u201cI\u2019m certain that stocks will fall by ten percent during that period.\u201d\u201cYou think that Thailand will surrender during that week?\u201dJonathan leaned a bit toward me and tried to erase the excitement in his eyes.\u201cIt\u2019ll take longer for that.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think will happen in the second week of June?\u201d\u201cDo you remember what I had said before?\u201d\u201cThat Thailand would be only the beginning?\u201d\u201cThe battle between the hedge fund coalition and Thailand has come to a situation where no one can expect the outcome. So far, the results have been that people think that Thailand would be able to successfully defend themselves.\u201d\u201cHowever, we think that they can\u2019t.\u201dJonathan used the word we.\u201cIf Thailand\u2019s stock price falls by more than ten percent during the second week, it will be a turning point. The atmosphere will change, and the fear will spread.\u201d\u201cPeople will panic.\u201d\u201cReinforcements, like sharks scenting blood in the water, will follow the hedge fund coalition that is attacking the baht, and the fear will spread all across Asia. The hedge fund coalition will change battlefields to harvest as much as they can, and their ultimate goal is\u2026\u201dI stopped and waited for Jonathan to answer.\u201cHong Kong.\u201dJonathan replied without hesitating like he had been thinking about this issue for a long time.\u201cYou\u2019re wrong. It\u2019s South Korea.\u201dJonathan frowned.\u201cIs that because it is your country? Korea is in a completely different situation compared to Thailand and others. The attackers cannot attack the foreign exchange of this nation. What are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. They cannot manipulate the Korean exchanges market, since they are blocked from funneling in funds from outside of Korea.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cHowever, the hedge fund coalition\u2019s funds will not be attacking Korea. It will be the fear that has spread across East Asia that now Korea has to face. Jonathan, the hedge funds are creating fear that the creditors will pull out the foreign investments that are in this country.\u201dAs he imagined the financial crisis from Thailand storming through Asia and, finally, Korea, Jonathan had become quiet. It would be quite a sight for someone on Wall Street. Jonathan\u2019s hands were tightly fisted now.\u201cSun, you want to stop it? An individual like you? That\u2019s very patriotic, but this is not my country.\u201dHe shook his head.\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me. People like us, our devotion and love is only for money.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euJonathan did not sneer or smile, and he silently nodded as he waited for me to speak the conclusion of this long tale.\u201cThe hedge fund coalition will fight the war, but the day after the war is over, they will know who has benefited the most. They will be surprised.\u201dEdited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The market may rise by one percent before falling by three and rise by two before falling by two. Then, in a second, the market collapses as investor fear reaches a tipping point. That\u2019s why trading skills become more important than strategy as the leverage ratio becomes higher.(EN: Leverage results from using borrowed capital as a funding source when investing to expand the firm\u2019s asset base and generate returns on risk capital. Leverage is an investment strategy of using borrowed money\u2014specifically, the use of various financial instruments or borrowed capital\u2014to increase the potential return of an investment. Leverage can also refer to the amount of debt a firm uses to finance assets.)If the leverage is fiftyfold, if the product value falls by only one percent, the loss becomes fifty percent. Regardless of the final closing price, even a two percent fall in value results in one hundred percent loss, which means the entire investment. It\u2019s as simple and as cruel as that.The reply I expected from Jonathan came back from America.-You\u2019re saying to put up the entire four hundred thousand dollars into fiftyfold leverage? Do you trust me? Or do you not care because it\u2019s not your money?Fiftyfold leverage means that we will be investing twenty million dollars. Our profit is fiftyfold, and our loss is also fiftyfold.However! If the product\u2019s temporary price falls below two percent, the game cannot be played any longer. It\u2019s called margin call, and the stock exchange will forcibly sell the product after one ignores the warning. That was the biggest risk of the leverage effect. But Jonathan was a man who succeeded in having the greatest year of his life by his trading skills alone, when the hedge fund coalition had suffered in Hong Kong around October.(EN: A margin call occurs when the value of an investor\u2019s margin account falls below the broker\u2019s required amount. An investor\u2019s margin account contains securities bought with borrowed money (typically a combination of the investor\u2019s own money and money borrowed from the investor\u2019s broker). A margin call refers specifically to a broker\u2019s demand that an investor deposit additional money or securities into the account so that it is brought up to the minimum value, known as the maintenance margin.)(EN: So if the temporary price falls below $400,000, game over.)That meant that Jonathan was a man who could survive in those rough waves if he believed in the trends that I had shown him. My answer had already been decided.-Believe the trend, and from now, it\u2019s up to you. I\u2019ll be waiting for the good news.Jonathan could not know that the chance to mobilize fiftyfold leverage for stock index futures was only now.***I met with Jonathan at Gimpo Airport on July fourteenth Saturday. He notified me that he had to meet me in person and came to Korea. A week had passed from the ninth to the thirteenth, and he had not contacted me once. Jonathan now came with a tired face, and he must have come as soon as he could after finishing trading. He would buy and sell, and do the same process again and again. I knew how hard he would have worked to maximize profit in a set timeframe. Jonathan must not have slept a wink, and he seemed tired as he looked for me at the gate.Our eyes met. He came walking towards me with renewed strength and spoke a number first.\u201cSeven hundred.\u201d\u201cThank you for working so hard.\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re not even asking me what that is? It\u2019s not a percentage, but I\u2019m talking seven hundred times. Seven hundred times, two hundred and eighty million dollars!\u201dJonathan looked like he had charged a monster and won despite overwhelming odds, and he hugged me with all his strength. He kept screaming \u2018Jackpot! We\u2019re insane!\u2019 and of course, we caught the attention of everyone around us. I bowed to the approaching airport police and separated myself from Jonathan. He had not been this excited when he had received a challenger-box level skill from a master box. He hugged me again with crazy eyes, and I again apologized to the airport police.Jonathan was going through countless emotions that he had suppressed all week, and as I dragged him out of the airport, everyone kept staring at us.\u201cHave you taken care of the positions?\u201d\u201cOf course! Be happy!\u201dJonathan had earned more than I had expected.\u201cYou finished exchanging the money for dollars, right?\u201dOf course, he would have done so, which means that we had taken out two hundred and eighty million dollars from Thailand\u2019s foreign currency reserve, which was being emptied in the first place. Dollars have become more valuable than gold, and our funds were enough to affect the Thailand currency war. Thailand will surrender to the hedge fund coalition on coming July second, and the baht will fall on that day. This was the previous history. History could not change due to our intervention, which means that Thailand would not surrender earlier. However, two hundred and eighty million dollars\u2026\u201cYou did well, Jonathan.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d\u201cYou did better than I expected.\u201dIt was made possible from knowing the trends and being able to bet one\u2019s entire savings on a thirteen-year-old Asian kid.\u201cBetter than expected? All right, you can say that to me. However!\u201dJonathan scratched his head and raised his voice.\u201c70,000%. It\u2019s an unprecedented earnings rate. We turned four hundred thousand dollars to two hundred and eighty million dollars. Me! Us! We became major players with this one shot! I can\u2019t believe this. This\u2026What have we done?\u201d\u201cYou should sleep, Jonathan.\u201d\u201cThe most inexplicable factor is you, Sun. You\u2019re a mystery. My most plausible explanation that you are the winner of the Chinese Mathematics Olympiad.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re in Korea, Jonathan. How long had it been since you slept?\u201d\\nHe seemed to have been unable to sleep on the plane.\u201cI\u2019m already dreaming.\u201dHis red eyes did not move from my face.\u201cLet\u2019s calm down first.\u201dI pressed down his shoulders as hard as I could. He did not complain of pain and looked up at me as he sat down.\u201cI can\u2019t have a heart attack in front of two hundred and eighty million dollars!\u201d***\u201cMother, I\u2019ll be sleeping at Sungho\u2019s house today. Father\u2019s on a business trip, right? Lock up tight before going to sleep.\u201dSungho was not a name I had made up, and he was one of my closest friends during my teenage years in my previous life. I would see his face in the same classroom when I go to school on Monday. I had been genuinely happy to see Sungho, at first, because he had disappeared since the Day of Reckoning. Like when I saw my relatives again.However, I realized that we would never be close again when I met the young Sungho\u2019s eyes. Actually, I simply couldn\u2019t afford to become his friend, in my second life. I had come back with a goal, one more important than mere friendship. So, the Sungho I had spoken to my mother was someone who existed but was an imaginary friend to me.I got out of the phone booth and went back to the room. Jonathan had only showered and had still not slept. Beer cans were everywhere in front of him in that brief interval.\u201cOh, my Sun!\u201dJonathan made me laugh by acting like he was greeting a goddess in his shower gown, which was no mean feat.\u201cAre you really not sleeping? There\u2019s tomorrow, which is a weekend.\u201d\u201cWe belong to the hedge fund coalition, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cWe became a hedge fund when we made the exchange, with only us as the board! A hedge fund worth two hundred and eighty million dollars.\u201dJonathan was basking in the fact that he had joined the major players in this currency war. As he had said, there was more meaning since we had succeeded by using only his capital rather than managing the hot money of big investors.\\n\u201c\u2026Are you really thirteen?\u201d\u201cDo you think you can contact the president of the Thailand Central Bank?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to give them eighty million to take a look at their warehouses? Does that even work?\u201dIt does, as I only need to compare it with the situation on July second that had been recorded in history.\u201cJonathan, go to Thailand. It\u2019s urgent.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to be shot, the president and me. And if they refuse?\u201dWe would lower the leverage and set a date for July first. It would mean a much lower earnings rate.\u201cEighty million dollars for letting us see a piece of paper in secret. Would you refuse? The eighty million dollars will not go to the president alone.\u201d\u201cThen who?\u201d\u201cThe president of the Thailand Central Bank is a member of the royal family.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s even more dangerous!\u201d\u201cThere would have been secret arrangements made, and the royal family must have guessed that they would lose. If they want to think about the future\u2026they will need money. They will accept the eighty million dollars.\u201dJonathan scratched his head.\u201cYou\u2019re saying that you would be able to estimate by seeing that?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe hedge fund coalitions will hold the war, and I will reap the actual benefits. However, the history of the financial crisis across Asia will not differ all that much. Since the hedge funds had seen how enticing the spoils of the war had been as they were taken away in front of their eyes, they would charge all the harder to Malaysia, Indonesia, Hong Kong, and South Korea.\u201cSun!\u201dJonathan shouted my name with an expression made from a dozen emotions I could not name.\u201c1997 will be the best year of our lives. Let\u2019s bet two hundred million dollars on it.\u201dEdited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Even though he had been an immature young man despite his powers, in his hands any weapon became Mj\u00f6lnir, the myth made real. A mere club struck like a weapon that came out from a platinum box or above, a sky shattering crack of thunder with every strike. A weak punch became a hit from the God of Thunder, capable of shattering meters of solid rock. In the aftermath, after he stormed by, there would be no bodies, human or monster with intact limbs left. The limbs that looked like an angry beast had bitten them off and spat them out were burnt, and as they rolled on the ground they discharged sparks of electricity, left over from the residual charge.I still was not able to forget. He had gone away after finishing his business, but I could not recover the kids\u2019 bodies. The blue flames he had left on the ground and in the air made the place like a burnt down charnel house. That kind of destructive power lay dormant in the Odin\u2019s Wrath skill.***It was early summer in South Korea, and the hotel room was cool thanks to the air conditioner. However, sweat dropped like rain as I bent down. My entire body was drenched in sweat, but there was not even the slightest sign of my stats increasing. I still had some stats I could raise by physical training\u2026Anyway, I had to prepare until I began conquering the dungeons in earnest.I made the necessary movements with various imaginary weapons as I imagined that a F class Guard Dog was in front of me. At the moment I became tired enough so I could not move, the phone rang.Thankfully, Jonathan contacted me before I had to return home, and his voice rang my ears.< In the early twenties. It\u2019s touch and go.>By touch and go, Jonathan was not speaking of the current situation Thailand was facing. He had said that Thailand still possessed more foreign currencies than we had thought and was starting to doubt the currency war would end with the hedge fund coalition\u2019s victory. I ended my calculations.\\nOur stage had moved from the Thailand stock index futures market to the foreign exchange future market.I heard Jonathan\u2019s breathing.(EN: Like the Pied Piper of Hamelin, leading the horde of rats in search of food. )\\nIf a famous hedge fund like the Dragon Fund attacked a country, they\u2019re inevitably followed by smaller companies that follow them, like hyenas, fighting each other for the scraps left over by the Lion. While individually smaller, their total size consisted of dozens of smaller entities that collectively dwarf the hedge funds that brought down the big prey. That\u2019s why hedge funds were scary. It was not their capital, but the hungry pack of investors and banks that followed them. Their relationship was similar to the one between the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues and the lesser ranked hunters around the world. A fight between them led to a country\u2019s ruin, brought on not by the main battle, but the hordes fighting over what\u2019s left.It had to be accurate, as that was the exact term Jonathan had used to describe the hedge funds whenever he boasted of his best time during 1997 in his past life.In other words, the fall of the baht on July second, 1997 will mean that I will be able to monopolize an S class dungeon.***July first was the day in history that Hong Kong was returned to China. It was inevitable that the media would continue to show Hong Kong\u2019s seashores where celebratory fireworks were exploding. The same clips showed the British Military Units leaving and the Hong Kong troops of the People\u2019s Liberation Army running to take their place.\u201cSon, do you know how Hong Kong became British?\u201d\\nI didn\u2019t even have a beeper, let alone a cell phone. The only way I could communicate with Jonathan was by email, and it was still quiet. We could transact about ten billion dollars in foreign exchange with a capital of two hundred million. Even if we wanted to bet all of it on the baht falling on July second, it was only possible if those in the opposite position permitted it. I had been waiting for Jonathan\u2019s email because of this since the baht market was already narrow.Currency had grades, and if the dollar was an S class, baht was an F class. The baht traded less than ten billion dollars a day in the foreign exchange futures market. I was not worried that the baht would fall, but the amount I wanted would not be finalized. So, what we were going to do was to monopolize the position that the baht will fall tomorrow.I kept refreshing the page, and I had been clicking every hour, but the intervals became shorter from thirty minutes to ten minutes. My eyes widened when Jonathan\u2019s email came in the empty mailbox. I had to say that the speed I clicked my mouse was as fast as lightning right then.The email had no title, and there was only one sentence. However, it made me stand up after kicking my chair.-Preparations for conquest complete.It had been a long time since I had heard those words. My fists tightened until my nails bit into my palm. I felt like that time I went into the dungeon with a bag full of supplies. We had thrown ourselves into the dungeon despite no one being certain we would survive.However, this time it was different. While my heart started to beat as I had gone into a dungeon, the cause was different. I was certain I would succeed despite not putting my life on the line. I would not feel the emptiness one felt when the points one gained with hard work became useless due to luck! No language could describe that emotion.Now, a box was in front of me again, and I knew what would come out of it. An astronomical amount of dollars! The only thing I had to do was wait. We monopolized tomorrow!-Thank you. I\u2019ll decide when we will liquidate.I replied to Jonathan. Was it because my infancy had been comfortable? Has peace become a habit? While it has been less than a year since I returned, subjectively, my past life, which I had lived out intensely, seemed to be something a long time ago. So, I recited Jonathan\u2019s email, over and over to myself, so I would not lose my determination to fulfill my goals.-Preparations for conquest complete.Editor: UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In my past life, Jonathan and I had agreed that the power of finance was an SSS class skill, since financiers like Jonathan and me were the love childs of 21st century capitalism. However, the beneficiaries of the New World, the Awakened, were at the position of criticizing that notion, but had not.Money\u2026 While I had never participated in elementary school class, (in either of my lives) I could not concentrate on the male teacher\u2019s words at the lecture desk, even more so today. I felt that the sound of the clock ticking was deafening, and as the minute hand and the hour hand overlap, it was noon in Korea, which meant that it was ten o\u2019clock in the morning in Thailand. The Thailand Central Bank is planning to announce that it will carry out the floating exchange rate system in thirty minutes. That\u2019s when things will begin.According to the previous history, the Singapore foreign exchange market, where the baht is transacted the most, is shocked and the widespread terror is like it had received a nuclear attack. It was the day the guilds, I mean groups, who had bet that Thailand would surrender, will see heaven. The groups that bet on Thailand surrendering in mid-July and those that had bet on Thailand winning would fall into hell. However, due to my aggressive intervention, those who had bet on the baht falling TODAY were just us and a small number of investors whose position we had been unable to take away. All others were tied to the baht rising, so we were waiting for the bomb to fall.It was twelve-thirty, and the fourth period had ended. The Thailand Central Bank president came out for a press conference at lunchtime, that time of the day most loved by elementary students. I stood up to go to the teacher\u2019s room. As always, when I moved, the students\u2019 eyes focused on me and looked away.I could not remember the young woman who was my homeroom teacher even after returning, and I should have if she looked as cute as she did. She gave the impression of being a cute puppy, and her head just reached my shoulder. She looked up from where she was sitting.\u201cSunhoo, you seem to get taller each time I see you. How tall are you now?\u201dI was over six feet and simply nodded instead of speaking.\u201cI need to leave school early because I feel unwell.\u201dThe woman blinked.\u201cYou probably feel better than me.\u201d\\nHowever, she was not hostile, as I was a student who did not cause problems in spite of my physique and got good grades. She seemed to remember that it was the first time she had heard my voice in a full sentence. She thought things over for a moment and waved her hand.\u201cGo.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cBut Sunhoo.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI know that it won\u2019t happen, but no one is bothering you, right? The reason I\u2019m saying this is that you seem to be alone all the time.\u201d\u201c\u2026My personality is like this, and I\u2019m more comfortable alone. Thank you for caring, teacher.\u201d\u201cYou even speak like an adult. Go to a hospital and see you tomorrow.\u201dThe young teacher\u2019s gaze was fixed on me even as I went out of the teacher\u2019s room. She seemed to be deeply interested, and I didn\u2019t understand why\u2026***\\nThe sound of the PC accessing the internet through a modem sounded loud since my house was empty. While the phone bill for last month was over one hundred and fifty thousand won (EN: Over a hundred dollars), my parents had not said anything. After I skipped the tutorial and came to this period, I was already a son like that. For example, I was always smiling in the picture albums, but my parents knew that I was smiling for the sake of them. I was always expressionless whenever someone took a picture without me noticing them, and the background was almost always a field filled with exercise equipment, including pull-up bars.The pictures that were taken without me noticing were usually when I was exercising. Of course, my parents had taken them, and I could feel why they had taken those pictures. I was a lot bigger than those my age, and my mental growth was the same. I was quiet and serious on all accounts. As my homeroom teacher had let me go with only a few words, my parents did not scold me with a communication expense of over one hundred and fifty thousand won, even if that was quite an amount for our family during this time. Anyway, the internet via PC communication was always slow. The speed with which I could access the Singapore foreign exchange site and the lag on the GOL messenger I used to communicate with Jonathan was excruciating. The Singapore foreign exchange site, which should be the fastest, was even slower than the messenger serviced from America. Too much traffic so I received the message first.-J: Sun!-N: It\u2019s me. (EN: Sunhoo is his family name, N = Na his given name.)-J: Tell me your full name.-N: I like you being careful. It\u2019s me, Sunhoo Na. Has the announcement been made?-J: It has.-N: How is our position ratio?-J: 70% on 34 baht, 15% on 32, and 15% on 30.-N: The average is 33 baht.\\nThe decline would not stop until the market ended, and those resisting were not acknowledging their defeat and loss. If this were about whose passion was bigger, they would have some hope. However, as Thailand had announced their surrender, there was no chance of emotion being a factor.History was moving on. The difference was that I should be in school, listening to a class lecture instead of trying to calm a fast-beating heart.***It would be some trillions of won. I realized that I would have an astronomical amount of money now, and the numbers rang in my head. While I had never touched this much money, I felt realization creeping up just by imagining the figure. While I washed my face with cold water multiple times, I still felt the heat on my face. Jonathan sent me a message every time the baht fell by 0.1. The messenger was quiet, but the numbers rang louder than anything else.-J: 29 baht.-J: 28.9 baht.-J: 28.8 baht.It was fortunate that we were separated since I knew the answers, unlike when I had opened boxes. If I had been with Jonathan, our excitement would have gone past the limit, and I might have spoken of future plans like a drug addict. Even as I wanted to believe that I would not do anything that stupid, no one knew what would happen in front of such crazy excitement. I had seen things like that happen many times, and I also had experienced such emotions. That was why I kept repressing myself and tried not to think about the amount.Damn. My life was not on the line, and I only had to receive the results. Why do my hands shake this bad? I clenched my fists as hard as I could and opened it. It worked a little.-N: Start to close.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If the coalition were absolutely certain of their victory, there is no doubt that they would have massively increased their share of the futures market where they could make a profit tens and hundreds of times more than their investment. The futures market functions to disperse the risks in the spot market.(EN: A futures exchange or futures market is a central financial exchange where people can trade standardized futures contracts defined by the exchange.[1] Futures contracts are derivatives contracts to buy or sell specific quantities of a commodity or financial instrument at a specified price with delivery set at a specified time in the future.)(EN: The spot market or cash market is a public financial market in which financial instruments or commodities are traded for immediate delivery. It contrasts with a futures market, in which delivery is due at a later date.)The Hedge Fund Coalition\u2019s main stage was, in the end, the spot market in the baht war, and the futures market was only used for risk management, as one of the many strategies.Did they not believe in themselves? Of course not. It\u2019s because the Hedge Funds manage billions of dollars, and the money is coming from a small number of the super rich. Using fiftyfold leverage is to take on a fiftyfold risk, and no fund would risk billions of dollars like that. Such a fund is a group of swindlers, and no one would blame them for being thrown into a bottomless pit.However, that was exactly what we were doing now.***God only knows what tomorrow\u2019s market price will be. No one had ever proceeded with a ten billion dollar transaction with a fiftyfold risk, and of course, no such bet had ever won!Our massive profit was a problem, since it might become a historical incident that could be used as justification to freeze the Thai futures market itself. This was because the baht market was small and limited.-N: Jonathan?The futures market was a zero-sum game, as someone must lose when someone wins. That also meant that the opposition had to accept the transactions in order for losses and profits to happen. Jonathan could not answer, as he would feel that ten copies of him would not be enough.While he probably had not slept a wink to monopolize a position that amounted to ten billion dollars, to liquidate them he would be so busy he wouldn\u2019t be able to use even the restroom.The foreign exchange information site restarted again after being frozen.\u201cUmm?\u201d\\nThe Singapore exchange rate was rising, and the graph measured by ticks was already steep. The situation was different from history. While the rate originally fell without any recoil, after repeating ups and downs, the trend was now on the rise at the end.The spot market and the futures market were going in opposite directions\u201429 baht, 29.5 baht, 30 baht. The baht was dramatically rising up! We would only make a profit when the baht fell down.-J: The market mood changed due to our mass liquidation. I\u2019m on it.An urgent sentence came upon the chatting window.-N: I apologize and won\u2019t bother you. Please focus.The chat was at a standstill for a long time. The meaning of us suddenly organizing our positions translates to \u2018it is not expected the baht will fall, and it will change to an uptrend.\u2019 It was true that our mass liquidation was changing the market mood, but it was not that problematic.Thailand applying the floating exchange rate means that they have given up on defending the baht currency, and while no one knew how long it would last, I would bet my life that the baht will fall. Such a thing was clearly evident to anyone who has a little bit of financial knowledge, and our dealers were the global elite, professionally successful and famous investors. Their eyes would be hungry for the money they had lost in front of their eyes.And it happened as I expected, as the trend changed to the baht falling again. The baht had sharply risen to 33, but now dropped to 30. However, the speed was crazy, as it did not take even five minutes for the baht to fall back to 30 after rising again to 31. I could feel the attention of investors worldwide gathered around here, and I could not even guess how much money was passing hands now.-J: Liquidation 80% complete and advise that the remaining 20% be held until the expiry date.I knew why Jonathan wanted to hold off on the last 20%. Completely liquidating our position when everyone was absolutely certain that the baht would fall was idiotic.-N: I understand your meaning but proceed as agreed.The money we were earning was from their pockets. We needed to give the investors a chance to make up some of their losses, so history would not diverge too much, and the battlefield would change.-J: The baht at 30 is stabilized, and risks have decreased.-N: No, Jonathan, the battle is over, and only the feast for hyenas remain. Liquidate all positions immediately and come to Korea on the weekend. The battlefield will change soon.\\n***Despite having said that, I knew that Jonathan would not wait until the weekend. As he had in the second week of May, he came over the next day after confirming our profit. I also went straight to Gimpo Airport right after my classes were over.\u201cThe Thailand baht fell to a record low rate due to the Central Bank announcing the application of the floating exchange rate system yesterday, and the baht was transacted at 30.40 baht per dollar. There is a sense of crisis all over Southeast Asia due to the fall of the baht\u2026\u201dYesterday\u2019s news was mentioned on the television installed in the airport. History had dramatically changed. Originally, it had been 28.40 baht per dollar after a 16% fall, but there was now a huge difference of 2 baht. A 0.1% difference in exchange rates and interest rates was higher than the sky and earth in the financial world. Another reason why we should not deal with Thailand again was added.\u201cSun\u2026\u201dJonathan approached me in an even worse condition than the second week of May. He looked like he had participated in endless battles where he had bet his life and actually looked about ten years older.When we had conquered dungeons together, he had been an old beast that had only malice left in him. He never fluctuated between hope and fears and only ran for points that would allow him to open a challenger box. Therefore, Jonathan had been a man who prepared for tomorrow even when he gained a great profit rather than basking in immediate joy.I had never seen him so completely tired before.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWe started to stare at each other without speaking, and I moved first. The restaurant we had our first meeting in was still unpopular like it had been then, and Jonathan\u2019s footsteps sounded heavy as we headed there.The reason we could not find words to speak easily was evident because we had no words to describe what was happening to us.Jonathan sat on my opposite side, and since both of his arms were clearly shaking, my eyes wandered toward them. However, Jonathan was not the only one doing so, as the water in the cup I was holding was also making ripples. I swallowed the water in a gulp and set the cup down.The sound the cup made on contact with the table functioned as a sign, and Jonathan started to lay down the documents on the surface. They were past transaction records and the final profit in our accounts. The transaction records themselves would make a thick book.\\nJonathan asked me, and I nodded.\u201cFifty billion dollars.\u201dJonathan mumbled as he understood.\u201cJonathan, we have to come to our senses and start working. The Asian financial crisis is only beginning.\u201d\u201cAh\u2026\u201d\u201cMaintain your health well. We will not be entering Malaysia and Indonesia.\u201dJonathan looked at me with aware eyes as I mentioned my plans for the future. He did not ask why we would not enter those two markets. That may mean he had complete faith in me now or had understood that the foreign exchange markets of those two countries were not big enough for our intervention. We had grown that big.\u201cWe will enter Hong Kong soon.\u201dI knew that Jonathan was most confident in the Hong Kong foreign exchange market, and his eyes glistened with a different excitement than before.\u201cI have a few things I need to ask of you.\u201d\u201cAnything.\u201dJonathan spoke like he would take his heart out if I asked him to.\u201cI need to buy some land in Korea.\u201dEditor: UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Jonathan, you must have realized it by now, but I do not like attention, especially in my country.\u201dJonathan started to say something but closed his mouth.\u201cMy parents do not know what we are doing. I\u2019m not meeting you but playing basketball with some classmates right now. Can you understand if I say it like this?\u201d\u201cSun, you\u2019re something.

However, being famous would help us, and actually is necessary.\u201d\u201cJonathan Investments, that\u2019s our company\u2019s name. Your name is listed as the CEO.\u201dJonathan seemed to have understood my meaning, and he mulled things over after scratching his head. The food we ordered arrived as he made a decision, and I could smell the steak now after reading his emotions.\u201cCan I do that? I have to acknowledge you even if I did not want to. You did the planning, and I did the trading, but even juniors can do trading with a rigged game. What I\u2019m saying is that your directions were everything.\u201dJonathan of the future and the one here were two clearly different people, but one thing remained the same. He had a conscience that was rare among Wall Street elites, as he had not lost it even when I knew him in my other life, that shell of a human being, driven only by revenge. That was why we could become comrades, and I looked at him again.\u201cYou can have all the fame that comes to Jonathan Investments. Think of it as payment for using your name and me having more shares.\u201dJonathan hesitated, but no one in Wall street would refuse fame. A famous celebrity\u2019s words held power to change the stock prices of a company. Then, what about someone who was one of the pillars in the financial world? There was a reason people said that earning money was low class and earning fame was high class.\u201cAbout the land in this country.\u201d\u201c\u2026Are you really all right with that, Sun?\u201d\u201cThat conversation is done. Anyway, there is no way to buy land in this country under our company\u2019s name. Foreigners and foreign firms are fundamentally blocked from buying real estate here.\u201d\u201cFor now?\u201d\\n\u201cIf the financial crisis comes to this country, the real estate market will open.\u201dSince the country would need dollars, I would be able to manipulate the laws. Jonathan stared at me as I explained to him the next step. He was not touching his steak, and me saying to eat before the food gets cold seemed useless.\u201cSun, I now do not question your assertion that your country will go through a foreign exchange crisis. However, I want you to clarify your intentions. It was only twice, but you succeeded beyond anyone\u2019s wildest dreams in two fields, the stock index futures and the foreign exchange market. But now, real estate?\u201d\u201cJonathan, real estate is only a small part. We\u2019re going to participate in any market we could make a profit.\u201dMy words caused a stir in Jonathan\u2019s eyes, and his pupils held me with a frightened expression. His eyes asked, how much from here, and to what extent. Was fifty billion dollars not enough for me? His surprise was turning to astonishment, and I may have seemed to him to be a devil at this moment.I had to ensnare him before he ran away in fear.\u201cI know that I\u2019m a bit greedy and smart.\u201dI even smiled, but Jonathan\u2019s expression remained stony as he grew serious. I waited until he opened his mouth. A heavy silence filled the room, and the restaurant\u2019s classical music changed the tune a number of times.\u201cSun, you and I, we\u2019ll be fine, right?\u201d\u201cWhy, do you think I\u2019ll eat you up? I\u2019m just greedy. How can I not be when a chance to earn money is in front of me? It would be unnatural not to grab that opportunity.\u201d\u201cBut you\u2026\u201d\u201cI\u2019m thirteen, but do you see me as that age? It\u2019s only a number written on documents. Forget my age, since you have to consider me as an equal colleague for us to work together.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not saying that. I\u2019m saying that\u2026you\u2019re special.\u201d\u201cAs I said, I know that. But that\u2019s not a reason to be scared of me.\u201dMy words seemed to have hit the spot as Jonathan swept back his hair with a rigid face.\u201cYou acknowledge that you scare people?\u201d\u201cOf course. I made four hundred thousand dollars into fifty billion in two months with two calculations. What could be scarier than that in a capitalist society?\u201d\\n\u201cI know that it wasn\u2019t luck. You\u2019ll go farther in the future. I can\u2019t imagine how much you\u2019ll earn.\u201dI expected Jonathan\u2019s shock, as he had been holding things in for a while.\u201cLet\u2019s cut to the chase. Jonathan, will you continue to work with me? As an equal colleague and not as the puppet of an Asian genius kid. If so, please eat. You\u2019re more nervous than usual now.***I ate my steak, as proficient with knife and fork as an American, and empty dishes piled up in front of Jonathan. His expression lost its rigidness when he really could not eat anything more. People needed to eat first, and when we entered dungeons, most of the supplies we prepared had been food.\u201cDivide the company, using my shares as collateral. If you want to, you can invest in as many common shares as you want.\u201d\u201cRight now?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying that we should start preparing slowly.\u201d\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying. How and how much exactly are you thinking about when saying division?\u201d\u201cThe more complicated the structure, the better. I want us, as the original owners to be undiscoverable. Aren\u2019t there people who do such things?\u201d\u201cThere are.\u201d\u201cThe structure has to be confusing enough, so even they do not know what they\u2019re handling, which means that you\u2019ll have to go through many firms.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying we should create hundreds of paper companies. It\u2019s definitely not my area. What\u2019s the reason for going so far?\u201d\u201cFifty billion dollars draws too much attention. What will happen if the funds go above five trillion?\u201dJonathan did not say I was crazy, and he seemed to have decided to think of money only as numbers after making his choice.\u201cOf course, I\u2019m only making a joke.\u201dI said in a joking tone, and Jonathan did not think of my words as one and asked a question. Of course, I had not been making a joke\u2026\\n \u201cOf course, I\u2019ll make sure they live comfortably. I\u2019ll tell them when the time is right. And Jonathan.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s work hard now so we won\u2019t be swallowed up and spoiled by our money. Then, won\u2019t all the wealth in this world be ours?\u201dWhile Jonathan\u2019s body had been weary and his spirit almost broken down when he came to Korea, he was smiling as he left. We had built trust. I will buy the dungeon and conquer it after the foreign exchange crisis when the real estate market would be open to foreigners.The Aliens Landownership Law would be completely revised in May 1998, but things would speed up. I will intervene.Edited by Userunfriendly(EN: Yes, Sun is the devil. ^_^ )Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 16: Past Life Returner Chapter 16 \\nPast Life Returner 16\\nYesterday, Ulsan became a metropolitan city from a former Company Town, after Sia Motors Corporation went into default. I was in a boxing gym the next day. As my left arm whipped back, my right punch hit the sandbag. (EN: Default is the failure to repay a debt including interest or principal on a loan or security. A default can occur when a borrower is unable to make timely payments, misses payments, or avoids or stops making payments. \u2026 Default risks are often calculated well in advance by creditors.)The sandbag violently rippled, and I was satisfied with the sound the punch made. The entire gym suddenly went silent, and everyone exercising was looking at me. The manager approached me.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to interrupt you, but are a pro? Who\u2019s your coach?\u201d\u201cI am not with any gyms.\u201d\u201cDo you have a license?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cAre you twenty-one?\u201dThe manager did not suspect a thing, and even I saw that my physique was that of someone in his early twenties. Of course, it could not be helped that my face looked younger. I nodded to maintain my disguise.\u201cThat\u2019s perfect!\u201dAs the manager beamed, I shook my head.\u201cExercise is a hobby for me.\u201d\u201cYour talent is stunning. Hit the sandbag again, and let\u2019s see the weight.\u201dThe manager went behind the sandbag and hugged it. He tapped where I should hit it with his palm, the manager\u2019s response had been inevitable.[Power: F (20)][Senses: F (20)]My stats were near the initial stats of professional athletes. I could move fluidly and accurately like those who have been trained.\\nI did as he wanted, and the manager smiled after feeling the weight being punched into the sandbag. The manager called a young man, who was someone the gym was raising as a professional. He told me to spar, and I did not refuse. The reason I came to this gym had been for this.***\u201cDamn!\u201dThe young man could not control his anger and screamed right after spitting out his mouthpiece. The eyes that glared at me were fierce as he shook with anger.It was something unimaginable in the future. An ordinary man against an awakened? It was the same for fights between the awakened. Except for comrades who trusted each other, taunting another awakened like that was clearly asking for a fight until death.No country\u2019s law nor military force would not intervene in that battle. The young man was lucky. Blood was coming out of the ripped glove, and he had to go down from the ring to stop the flow.\u201cManager.\u201dI also spat out the mouthpiece. The manager spoke like he had been waiting.\u201cHey! Hey! You don\u2019t need to go anywhere, right?\u201d\u201cAre there any others? I\u2019m barely warmed up.\u201d\u201cGichan, go up!\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dA new guy called Gichan prepared to enter the ring. He glanced at me as he put the boxing head guard on and bit into a mouthpiece. His gaze was somewhat familiar because hunters looked at guild members from other countries like that. I was a stranger here, too.The bell rang, and the new guy was slightly better than the previous one. However, he was still at an amateur level, and the only thing I could compliment was that he endured the pain when I accurately hit him in the stomach. However, his movements slowed from then and allowed me to dominate.The feeling of hitting something was not welcome because I was too weak, compared to the Awakened I remember being. Even as I gave the punch my all, he did not immediately go down. Gichan stumbled and leaned against the corner.\u201cGichan, come down!\u201d\\nThe manager shouted.\u201cI can go on.\u201d\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201dThe manager came up to the ring and sent Gichan down, and began to prepare himself. I didn\u2019t stop him. While the trophies in the showcase were won by the athletes affiliated with the gym, the old picture hanging at the most visible spot in the gym depicted a young man in a fighting pose. He had to be the manager, and the younger version had a champion belt around his waist. Even if he had retired, the manager and previous champion were better than mediocre amateurs.After allowing a few of the manager\u2019s punches in my face, memories of my first training when I had been an E class flashed by. I had done that training with eight other E classes.I took a clean hit, and I felt blood in my mouth even while biting the mouthpiece. The manager was going on full force, and he let the muscle memories in his body do their thing.While his power and reaction speed were not like his professional days, his expertise and skill were not lost despite the time. The manager knew that he could not face me without giving his best, and his smiling eyes turned firm. I threw an uppercut under his chin.There were many ways to take the manager down when I found a gap in his defense, such as a kick, elbow slam, tackle, and striking inside the fold of his joints. However, I had to follow the rules of boxing since I was at a boxing gym. With a loud thud, the manager staggered. I distanced myself and moved to the corner of the ring. The manager acknowledged the situation.\u201cHey! What was your name?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Jungho. Jungho Kim.\u201d (EN: Yep, an alias.)\u201cJungho, let\u2019s go for the Rookie of the Year Award! You said you don\u2019t have a license. You can do this! Right?\u201d\u201c\u2026Is there anyone else?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cSomeone who took the Rookie title, or a pro. I still need some more training.\u201d\u201cI see you have stamina! I know you\u2019re strong, but how about stopping there? You\u2019re rushing things.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\\nI had three reasons for coming to the gym. The first was to confirm when the title \u2018Adversity Overcomer\u2019 became effective. The second was to try to train for combat with my currently lowered stats, as all my battle skills are from my past life, as an Awakened. The third was to secure the stats that I could raise by merely training to my limits. Unless I prepared for everything, I could not even look oward where the dungeon was.However, as a light heavyweight boxer hammered punches on my face and stomach, I could not ignore the anger that came from deep inside. He latched onto me, and we grabbed each other\u2019s necks as our breathing grew hot and rough.We went back to our corners as the bell rang in the gym. The people gathered could not hide their surprise when I went against the manager. However, after I fought in the fourth round against a pro boxer, they began to cheer at my punches.Some of the new members looked like they were rooting for me. Someone gave me a towel to wipe my sweat, and as I wiped the sweat off, I mumbled just in case in a faint voice no one could overhear.\u201cStatus window.\u201d[Name: Sunhoo Na. Stamina: F (2) Power: F (20) Agility: F (13) Senses: F (21) Accumulated points: 87]Oh! My senses had increased by one. The spar had been fierce like an actual fight, and that was why I must not have seen this message.[Your senses have increased by 1.]***\u201cDaesoo, you\u2019re not going soft on him, right?\u201d\u201cThat kid\u2026where did he come from? You hit the jackpot today, Manager.\u201d\u201cHahaha.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t laugh when I\u2019m dying here.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t lose, though.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that. I have to save face as a pro.\u201dHowever, Daesoo thought that it would be difficult even as he forced himself to smile. Daesoo stood up as he tapped his head with both of his gloved hands. His eyes grew cold as he stared down at Sunhoo.\u201cYou\u2019ll see me at my best. Don\u2019t blame me for this.\u201dEdited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 17: Past Life Returner Chapter 17 \\nPast Life Returner 17\\nThe bell in the gym rang, and the fifth round started. The Daesoo Park\u2019s mood had changed, and now his punches were fewer, and started adjusting the distance between us more. He was saving his stamina by withholding unnecessary movements, but he can\u2019t trick me. The pro was actually going for it in this round. He was waiting for me to come in like a hunter who had set traps for monsters and was patiently waiting in the blind.I went in while knowing his intentions as I swung a clearly visible punch. Since I confirmed that I still had stats left over that I could raise through physical training, it was time to work on my next objective.When his punch hit my chin, my sight turned black. My gaze was turned sideways as I opened my eyes. I saw the audience as a blur, and my legs were shaking, and I could not get my strength back immediately. I managed not to fall as I went back into the corner, but Daesoo Park latched on to me.Giving a pro my chin when I was weak had been more dangerous than I had anticipated. While my goal had been confirming under which conditions \u2018The Man Who Overcome Adversity\u2019 would come into effect, my reflexes and instincts accumulated at the brink of death did not allow me to be beaten by him so easily.When I came to my senses, I shielded my face and body using my gloves as shields. I was waiting for a moment to counterattack.His punches were swinging in, and I saw an instant between my gloves that were shielding my face, a gap where I could punch him at the chin. My entire body witched like ants were crawling all over me, and I wanted to teach him a lesson. I even wanted to punish him for his temerity by using my ability. I thought of the skill Odin\u2019s Wrath.When Odin\u2019s Wrath manifests into this world, his entire face would burn beyond endurance. Parts of his face would crumble into ash or explode as the water in his facial muscles are instantly superheated into steam. Black burnt flesh would splatter everywhere, and dancing blue flames would spring up as if a demon was laughing. His headless corpse would fall twitching and spasming, as the residual electrical charges in his nervous system dissipated. It would be a horror unleashed in this peaceful world.I tasted something sick in my mouth. While my sight was blurry, I knew that my balance had been destroyed. One became weak mentally when one\u2019s body became weak. My eyes turned cold, and I saw my comrades who lost their minds to anger, rage or despair and fell under mental oppression. I heard their screams in my mind. The good thing was that things like that could not happen in this ring. (EN: Yep, Sun has PTSD. Pretty intense too.)\u201cStand up.\u201dI heard an angry voice over my head, and I sat up. Why wasn\u2019t the title coming up? I almost fainted for a moment.\u201cI said, stand up!\u201d\u201cDaesoo, you\u2019ll murder him!\u201dI heard the manager\u2019s voice, and their voices became clearer, and my sight returned.\u201cYou can do more. Right? Jungho?\u201d\\nHe was about to force me to stand up, and he had a sharp eye. I nodded and showed the manager who was coming up the ring that I refused to go down. The manager looked worried, but the audience became wild.Daesoo waited with eyes that said you had started this, and he returned to the center of the ring and posed. While I also prepared to fight again, my breath was rough, and I felt that rocks had been placed on my chest, suffocating me. He also looked like he was tired, but his eyes were sharper than before. They were saying that he would resolve his anger as much as he could before going down. I could only stand in the face of his wrath.It was inevitable since I had deliberately let a pro hit my chin twice with stats of an F class, which was on the level of an ordinary individual. Everything was relative, and while the punches coming now were slower and weaker, they were stronger and more threatening.I had this coming to me as his eyes said, and if I had faced him in the usual manner, I would not have been driven to a corner like this. His punches landed everywhere with loud thuds.I already could not strengthen my stomach, and I clenched my teeth to prepare for the next as he punched my abdomen.My back bent with sharp pain, and his gloves filled my eyes. My head was wrenched without mercy a few times, and I thought that I felt something so very familiar in my mouth. It was the taste of blood.I could not feel the mouthpiece that had been inside my mouth, and it had been knocked away without my knowing.\u201cStop! Hey! Are you trying to kill him?\u201dThe manager\u2019s voice was faint, like he was talking a hundred feet behind me. I did not hear the rest of his sentence because I had allowed a punch to hit me right on the face. I knew that it was enough to knock me unconscious the moment I felt it. However, the feeling of falling into an abyss was gone in an instant, and my eyes opened easily, and I felt strength return to me.[\u2018The Man Who Overcome Adversity\u2019 has been activated.]I saw a message in front of me.[Your stamina level has changed. Change: F -> E][Your power level has changed. Change: F -> E][Your agility level has changed. Change: F -> E]\\n[Your sense level has changed.

Change: F -> E][Your wounds will heal by a little.][You will not feel pain for a while.]I had to be unable to fight for the Adversity Overcomer to kick in.***The manager came running into the ring, and some of the audience came with him. Chaos ensued for a while.\u201cAre you crazy? That was unnecessary!\u201dThe manager blew up at him, and he was staring at me. It was a spar without headgears, and while I did not know how bad my face was, the manager and the audience\u2019s response gave me an estimate. Daesoo looked belated after some of his anger lessened.I stood up and felt that some of my injuries were healed a bit. My heart was now just pumping wildly when I had thought it would explode before.\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201dRough breaths and blood sprayed out with each word, and the ring floor around me was a mess with my blood.\u201cYou rang it three times. There\u2019s one more round left.\u201d Someone said, eager to see the fight continue.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I must have gone crazy\u2026\u201d\\nHe would not know the regenerative qualities of an awakened, and wounds like these would be completely healed in three days without stitches.\u201cI\u2019ll come again soon. I\u2019ll go first now!\u201dI barely managed to pull him off.\u201cThe Man Who Overcome Adversity\u2026\u201dI thought of what had happened as I walked, and it was after I came back to my senses as the effect of the trait wore off.The trait The Man Who Overcome Adversity did not activate by self-wounds from my previous experiments, and it only activated when I could not fight anymore from attacks from others. I realized there was a deep meaning to the title, turning the situation around and allowing me to continue the fight with heightened powers. I felt that it meant those that were weak mentally, regardless of their physique, were unworthy of the title.Well, The Man Who Overcome Adversity had to be strong mentally, even though I tried not to remember when I came out of the birth canal during my birth because it was so painful. However, I also thought that I should not just repress it, as my memories of what I overcame might help sometime.I had been walking when my eyes went to the television news being shown in an electronic store\u2019s showcase window.[Development Bank. \u2018Southeast Asian Financial crisis will not affect the domestic economy.\u2019]A large caption was written on the lower part of the screen, and the main anchor was delivering the news. I could understand what was going on by reading lips despite being unable to hear anything.\u201cThe Thailand baht\u2019s fall is not settling down. There has been a domino effect in all of Southeast Asia, such as the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia, as their currencies also show a continuous fall. Regarding this issue, Ilju Jo, the Head of the International Planning Department in the Korea Development Bank, says that \u2018we have prepared as we have been monitoring the Thailand economic crisis from late last year, and it will not affect our country.\u2019 This was Chuljin Kim.\u201dHe said that we would not be affected, but Korea will take one of the greatest hits.

My left eye was almost closed shut, and the reflection that stared at me in the store window looked like a gang had beaten me. I had expected this to happen, which was why I had used Sungho\u2019s name to stay out of the house. Since it was the final exam season, I was supposed to be staying at Sungho\u2019s house to study until tomorrow, which was Constitution Day.I had two ten thousand won bills in my pocket, my mother had given me the money to buy some treats to eat when studying with Sungho. (EN: $50.50. Yep, mom gave pocket money to a guy who\u2019s worth TRILLIONS of won. ^_^ )I stopped by a public bathroom in the park before going to an Internet cafe, and my clothes dried quickly despite wearing them wet after washing because it was a hot midsummer night. Pedestrians did not glance at me after I put on a wrinkled baseball cap out of my bag. The smell of cigarettes in the Internet cafe made me feel nostalgic.I sat in one of the cubicles with a note hand-written by the owner instead of a membership card and accessed an American messenger site. I looked over the market conditions as I waited for Jonathan.***There was a monster called the Abyssal Ants, and while their size was less than that of a human palm and could be stomped to death, there were two reasons why the Awakened disliked them. They tended to swarm and were voracious and indiscriminate eaters. I had never seen them move around solo, and they moved for only one purpose in swarms numbering from a hundred minimum to tens of thousands. They were always hungry and would gnaw at everything in their path.After they left everything in ruins, they would continue to move for new prey since the ants had endless hunger. The Hedge Funds and the investors that controlled them were just like that. They moved in groups and would eat anything in their path. They were touring Southeast Asia now.Since the money they should have gobbled up was now in my pockets, they would be desperately famished by now. Their antics were now more aggressive than they had been in the original history, as they were attacking the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia at the same time. Originally, the financial world had viewed Southeast Asia as one group, but it was a bit different this time.I felt the worry in their movements since they must have noticed what was going on. They now knew that an unknown group had monopolized the position that the baht would fall on July 1st and had taken all the profits.-J: Sun.-N: I have been waiting. Don\u2019t you think they have now noticed what is going on?Jonathan had to know what I was talking about with only that vague hint if it was him.-J: They will be seriously interested in knowing who emptied their pockets.-N: They are attacking the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia in one group. Isn\u2019t it evident that they are rushing things?-J: That they are afraid of us? Can\u2019t that be a good thing?-N: It might cause some problems in my calculations. Mistakes are made when rushing things, and I can\u2019t calculate what mistakes they will make.\\n-J: You\u2019ve done enough. Let\u2019s forget it. Have you checked your email?-N: Yes.-J: As we have talked, I have assembled a task force of six people. How about inviting them to Korea? They should know who the actual owner of Jonathan Investments is.-N: You haven\u2019t told them who I am, right?-J: Of course.-N: You remember what I said before. I\u2019m in your shadow. Please keep that in mind, Jonathan.-J: Ok.Jonathan began to report on new developments, and he had commissioned the processes for dividing the company to a new firm and had selected eight other firms to continue the process. If we changed firms after a process was completed, each group would only work with the documents they received without knowing what they were handling. They would be unable to see the whole picture.-N: How many paper companies do you think will be laid out?-J: Considering the ones we will have in tax havens, over a thousand. The commission fees are going to be astronomical. How are you going to distribute them? Have you thought of a plan?-N: I\u2019ll send you an email in the morning.-J: Morning? I forget that you\u2019re in Korea sometimes.-N: What about Jeffrey K?-J: He\u2019s positive about it.-N: That\u2019s nice. I have another thing for him to do, along with buying out the investment firms.I could not continue using other people\u2019s servers when emailing or chatting with others, and the same went for phones. While I had chosen GOL messenger after looking over its security system, to hackers, the messenger was horribly vulnerable, with only anonymity and traffic volume as protection.\\n-N: Do you know Predict?-J: Of course.-N: It\u2019s our first priority to buy out.I would not have chosen Predict if it was only for their database products. The fact that Predict achieved a record-breaking rise from late 1998 to when the dotcom bubble exploded and reached a market capitalization of 200 billion dollars was a minor factor before the Day of Reckoning.The database language they had made was the ubiquitous standard in the eighties. Data considered top secret such as dungeons, monsters, skills, abilities, items, insignias, box rates, and others were handled in the databases written in the language they had made. While each country and guild made their own databases using Predict\u2019s development tools, the best databases had been made by their in-house programmers.The guild controlled by the Second Virtue, Revoluchion, had considered their database, as important as their battle skills in the original timeline. If I had a chance to see Revoluchion\u2019s database at least once, the battle against the Eight Virtues and Eight Evils might have been a bit different. Of course, I knew that my intervention would change history, such as different internal development team members. Therefore, it was important to decrease the variables as much as possible.-J: Dear God, now IT?-N: As I have said, I will put anything that earns a profit in our portfolio. I am planning to invest aggressively in other IT firms if there\u2019s an opportunity.-J: It\u2019s not a mere investment in Predict\u2019s case.-N: I want a hold on the current CEO Donald Pinn as much as I can.-J: You\u2019re not going to interfere with their management and only enjoy their growth? However, Donald will not sell his company. Even if you succeed in a hostile M&amp;A, he will just leave the company in anger.-N: Predict is our top priority, and we will probably succeed if we give him the best possible stock options ratio in the field to Donald. The same goes for his annual income. If he leaves with those two conditions, it can\u2019t be helped.We would keep him motivated with stock options and buy Predict above their actual value with the maximum price available. Would he not be allured by the prospects?***Owners of massive capital are not mentioned in Forbes. They either anonymously monopolize basic resources such as metal, oil, and grain or are hidden in conspiracies embedded in history. However, there was a symbolic honor in being one of the richest people ranked in Forbes each year.Counting his stock options and other benefits, Donald Pinn was ranked seventh in 2017, with fifty billion dollars. If we took out commission fees and other costs, that was about how much we had earned in Thailand. I felt that we still had a ways to go when thinking about that.\\n-J: We are going to buy Predict, but we should not be the ones who have bought it as far as the world knows.-N: Yes, all transactions are going to proceed like that.-J: Some selected paper companies will be made into real companies, and the CEO of that company won\u2019t know anything about Jonathan Investments and us. Is that right?That was the core. They would be our companies, but the CEO and the employees would not know about our existence.-J: However, there have to be connections that will connect our subsidiary companies and us.-N: That\u2019s why we will need several imaginary friends under a detailed design.Like my friend Sungho.-N: You don\u2019t need to worry. It won\u2019t be difficult after we divide the company. We will create paper companies that will be in charge of controlling other companies and will create paper companies to control our controllers. We will build several layers with this method.-J: So, no one would know where the commands are coming from\u2026-N: The parties will think that they received their commands from above, which is why the separation should be done in as many layers as possible.-J: Forget about your master plan for a second. Where did you learn all this?-N: Do you know now what you should do?-J: Yes. Sun, you do know what we\u2019re doing\u2026The American government could imprison us for life.-N: I do. I understand that Predict M&amp;A will need some more time. Look at the time now. We should earn money.

Jonathan had been frozen in shock when the giant\u2019s hand caught him and he started wiggling uselessly to get free. Only Jonathan\u2019s face was clear of the giant\u2019s fist, and it was when the giant raised his fist to his face that Jonathan could finally see the massive facial features.It was a familiar face. Sun? The giant\u2019s face was that of a mysterious Asian boy. Jonathan opened his mouth to scream before he was swallowed by Sun, who had become a giant.It had been too vivid of a dream. Even after he woke up, Jonathan felt the terror and helplessness in the dream, and his heart was still racing.Jonathan\u2019s mood was low, and he knew the source of this anxiety. While Sun was thirteen years old on documents, his brain and body were definitely not thirteen. Jonathan had met those called geniuses during his Ivy League days, and he saw the way their brains literally outclassed anyone they met. Jonathan had been continuously humbled by them, but those genius children had been only young children at heart even if they had world class intellects.\u201cHowever, Sun is\u2026\u201dJonathan had thought that Sun was one of those geniuses when he had guessed the fall of Thailand stocks and the baht right down to the exact date. He had heard of something similar before.\u2018I have tens of thousands of plans in my head, and I\u2019m taking them out to use them.\u2019Words that were unfathomable for the ordinary. Jonathan had thought that Sun\u2019s calculations had come from those countless plans, and his genius simply lay in the financial field. It could happen. How could a genius be explained by the ordinary? It was like a blind man estimating how an elephant looked by touching it. Jonathan was thinking about the way Sun thought in general.He was thirteen, and it was an age where people dream, confident that they understood the world. It was an age people boasted of how great they will be after one or two decades. However, Sun was beyond those levels, and he knew what to do. He seemed to have made preparations before he found Jonathan, and Sun had the intelligence to have ambitions and the expertise to act on them. He had the decisiveness to proceed with something that may get them sentenced to jail for life. It was like he had no fear of the unknown.Jonathan was now closely connected with Sun despite not knowing him well, and their destiny lay together now. If the United States government discovered the company\u2019s hidden funds, Sun would not be alone when being sentenced to decades in prison. Jonathan\u2019s eyes became bright when his thoughts arrived there.\u201cIt was impossible, even when I think of it now.\u201dWhat had happened until now was amazing enough to make a film, but what they had to do now is even more dangerous than before. After he got up, Jonathan lifted his phone because he remembered the phone number of a skilled international private detective firm. However, he was unable to dial the number at the end.\u2018Even if I had Sun investigated now\u2026\u2019When Jonathan had established an investment firm with his four hundred thousand dollars and gave away 51% of the shares as if a devil had whispered to him, he did so because he felt like he was investing in Sun.\\n\u2018I have to continue thinking like that and not think of anything else.\u2019Jonathan sat in front of his computer, and there were many emails. Some of them were from the firms dividing the company into pieces, and there was one from Sun. The first step of the process had ended, and eight paper companies were made. What was left was distributing billions of dollars according to Sun\u2019s orders.\u201cMost of them offshore\u2026He\u2019s crazy\u2026\u201dWhat Jonathan had been expecting came. Jonathan began to write a reply to Sun, and while his hands shook, he had already made the decision a long time ago.-I\u2019ll proceed as we discussed.A few weeks passed after that night.***Wall Street\u2019s lights did not go out, as there were various markets all around the world and their opening and closing times were different. It was the same for Jonathan\u2019s office, and everyone was here late at night. However, they were silent, unlike other offices, and it was because Jonathan had revealed Jonathan Investments\u2019 funds to his team members before the actual meeting.All the team members knew that Jonathan Investments did not have other investors, which meant that all that money was Jonathan\u2019s. He had become a billionaire in just a few months.\u201cCan you explain this? I cannot even imagine how this came to be.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s simple. I invested and earned.\u201d\u201cJesus Christ! Jonathan! Do you realize what you\u2019re saying? I know how much you could have raised at first. I\u2019m sorry to say that it would have been less than a million dollars.\u201d\u201cIt was four hundred thousand dollars and not a million.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t kid me.\u201d\\n\u201cDo you think this is a joke? Where do you think your payroll comes from?\u201dJonathan pointed to the account status on the monitor.\u201cOh my god\u2026how can this be?\u201d\u201cI already I made the money. I understand how you feel because I felt the same when I started.\u201d\u201cJonathan!\u201dThe questions didn\u2019t stop, and Jonathan sighed.\u201cWhere else would I have earned this much money? It was Thailand, of course. I bet all of my funds on two chances, the second week of May and on July second. Isn\u2019t that enough?\u201dJonathan felt the weight of his team\u2019s looks of disbelief and shock, and while he was blatantly taking all the credit, Sun had been the real genius. The numbers they had been shown were also not true, only a fraction of the Fifty Billion US Dollars that were currently being divided into paper companies according to Sun\u2019s plans.\u201c\u2026You made four hundred thousand dollars into THIS! You, Jonathan?\u201d\u201cI understand your surprise, but how about stopping there? Stop shouting, this is not a frat party.\u201dJonathan spoke casually before everyone\u2019s astonished eyes.\u201cDon\u2019t you guys realize what kind of a chance this is for you? There are only six of you and one more who are employed by this company. I am going to treat you guys as well as I can, which is why I brought you here.\u201dOnly the sound of people gulping could be heard, and someone now spoke.\u201cSo, we\u2019re looking at a legend.\u201d\\nEveryone thought now that Jonathan was no longer one of them. His success would bring in much more fame than simple numbers. The customers would line up with their money and Jonathan Investments\u2019 future was unimaginable\u2026\u201cYou can know that Jeffrey is researching investment firms we\u2019re going to buy out.\u201dJonathan stirred up another storm in the others\u2019 thoughts by that revelation.\u201cJeffrey!\u201d\u201cJeffrey Kay?!\u201dJonathan nodded and pointed at the window.\u201cWe probably will be there after this project ends.\u201dWall Street\u2019s land taxes were vastly different when a mere road separated them. Jonathan was pointing at the building that had towered over all lesser Wall Street\u2019s traditional landmarks.\u201cYou now know that your choice was not wrong.\u201dJonathan spoke as he met his team member\u2019s eyes one by one.\u201cCongratulations.

When I went training at various gyms in Seoul and regularly had freshly bandaged injuries, while my parents supported me, my schoolmates made a lot of noise. The rumors about me were cringingly childish for me to hear, as they said I was fighting off Secret Murim Clans or I was a candidate for Leadership in a Triad.(EN: Triads are Chinese organized crime families)However, the inane antics of those young children ended after summer vacation began. Today was one of my vacation days, and I was enrolled in summer cram classes and playing basketball with my imaginary friend Sungho. Or at least, that\u2019s what my mother knew about my schedule.\u201cSon, bring Sungho here one day. I haven\u2019t seen the face of your best friend.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAre you going to continue boxing?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll stop if you want me to.\u201d\u201cYou always go a bit too far. I like that you started to exercise again.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dMy mother took Madecassol out of her apron pocket, and it was a familiar ritual these days. She would stop me from going out and apply the anti-scarring ointment on my wounds.\u201cIt\u2019s all right if you\u2019re a bit rebellious.\u201dI replied with only a wordless smile.\u201cMy handsome boy, my son. Come home early. Do you have your allowance?\u201dWhile I had used it all up, I would have no reason to live by a middle schooler\u2019s allowance from today. There was money coming in.***[Il Shin Financial Holdings held a board meeting on the 21st and announced that they would establish \u2018Jeon il Investments,\u2019 a joint investment firm with Golden Wish, a foreign firm specializing in international investments. This decision has been made under the benefits the government promised\u2026]\\nBecause it was only a short article, it was not at the level that would be written up in the newspaper yet. A VIP high up must have ordered this press release to let the public have something hopeful amidst the anticipated foreign exchange crisis.The picture attached was small and in black and white, and there were no specific numbers regarding the foreign funds this deal would bring in, and it just showed some unnamed foreign CEO was shaking hands with the CEO of a small holdings firm. While the article was exaggerating things by calling it a firm specializing in international investments, Gold Wish was only a hollow paper company. However, the government was already promising benefits.Foreign capital was flowing out, and even domestic investors took out their funds as fear spread in the market. I understood that they would want to grasp anything at this point, but\u2026It was a pitiful situation, and it was then a shadow leaned over the newspaper I was reading.I looked up to see the same foreign man as in the picture looking down at me. While his cap was pulled on low, his jaw exactly matched the picture.I gave him the code word, and received the counter sign, and the man\u2019s expression was not happy. He looked dissatisfied with why he had to do even this kind of dirty work, but he just laid down the briefcase he was assigned to deliver and hurriedly went away.I went somewhere quiet and opened the case to see about a million dollars in hundred dollar bills. It would be about a billion won in today\u2019s rates, and the money was from the slush funds that had come out of dividing our original company into innumerable paper companies.***One needed identification documents in the financial field to exchange currencies when the scale was a million dollars and up. However, the backstreets of Myeongdong still stuck to the transaction methods before the real-time financial system came into effect, and the old owner who dealt in dollars welcomed me with her open arms.While a million dollars would be a small amount to her, who was called \u201cMyeongdong\u2019s Big Mama,\u201d no one was exchanging dollars to won at all these days.Therefore, the black market had also frozen down, and I was a customer who had graced her store in these hard times. I was also a customer in my previous life\u2026\u201cCan you carry all that alone? Do you want me to have my boys deliver that for you in a car?\u201dThe owner asked as she pointed at the stacked money boxes. While her face was severe, she was friendly in her actions.\u201cI called a truck. Please have them load it and let me use your phone once.\u201dThe owner picked up the receiver on the desk and brought it to me. I heard the call connect after I pressed the buttons.\\nThe truck I had hired was waiting outside, and I climbed into the passenger seat after the money boxes were loaded. It was best to have the billion won in cash. It would be tied up if I used a bank account, and the account brokers would try to swindle me anyway.\u201cMr. Kim!\u201dThe real estate agent was waiting for me where we had agreed to meet and helped me move the money boxes from the truck. His sedan\u2019s trunk and backseat were filled with money boxes. The agent\u2019s expression was serious as he spoke.\u201cYou must be doing something huge since you\u2019re so young. I envy you.\u201dEven if the money in the boxes were from the black market, he seemed not to care.\u201cAre there any changes in the contract?\u201d\u201cYour conditions will be met. President Choi is said to own many buildings in Gangnam, and everyone in my field knows him. You can trust him.\u201dWhile the real estate guy said it indirectly, he clearly meant that since his customer was rich, he would not mind this small under-the-table contract. I had put out a condition for the office rental.I would pay the rental fee for two years at once with cash but would not use my real name and identification for the transaction. While it was illegal, the real estate agent and the leaseholder agreed to my conditions.I procured an office in the middle of Gangnam with an astounding rent fee because the buildings around here met my security conditions.Only those with ID cards could enter, and guards were standing by 24/7 in the luxurious lobby. The real estate manager could only guide me to my office with a guard and a deputy of the leaseholder as our escorts.\\nI gave him my office address and went into the reason I called him.While only Jonathan was doing the long flights, we could not set up a middleman. After two days, I took Jonathan, who had come from America to my office. There were various exercise machines in the office, and they took about half of the office space.Jonathan clucked his tongue and tapped the sandbag. As I remembered the awakened Jonathan, his awkward movements bothered me.\u201cWhile I had guessed, you must be manic about exercise. Wait, is that a sword?\u201dJonathan discovered the sword I had placed in a corner. From how his eyes glinted and he forgot about being tired, he was relishing my office\u2019s strange atmosphere. Jonathan had been heading to where the sword was when he saw something else.\u201cYou\u2019re not the one who drew this, right?\u201dJonathan asked in front of the picture I had hung on the wall. When I did not reply, Jonathan looked certain. The drawing was not framed, and the indentations of the pencil could be clearly seen. Jonathan talked about how realistic the monsters looked in the picture to explain how skilled I was at drawing.He seemed more relieved than enjoying himself, and he sat as he asked me about my hobbies. He was asking about my parents, whether I had siblings, and how I had grown up.I changed the subject to the suitcase he had brought along, despite the fact that Jonathan obviously wanted to avoid it.\u201cCan I confirm the material you brought with you?\u201dThe names of our paper companies filled a book, and they numbered over a thousand. I could also see how the funds had continued to move through them. Jonathan\u2019s face was rigid after taking out all of the documents, and I knew why. The documents in front of me could be the fatal weakness that would imprison us for the rest of our lives in an American prison.\u201cIf we hire good lawyers and are fortunate in the judges, it will be offshore tax evasion and not embezzlement. Either way, the amount is huge enough to be considered an unprecedented financial crime. However, everyone does this. We\u2019re just different in scale.\u201dEditor: UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He seemed to have given his all to set up the complex labyrinth of paper companies, as the relations between the more than a thousand paper companies were as convoluted as you could imagine. Circular shareholding and holding structures were arranged in a complex manner to make the reader\u2019s head spin.The firms that had done this for us were following the laws, but the sum total became illegal when we assembled the complete structure. Ironically the firms that had actually done the deed had broken no laws, but we had by merely planning and designing this golden Puzzle Box.\u201cSo, these are the originals. May I have them?\u201dJonathan slowly nodded. The connections were complicated enough that even a few missing pages would need years of investigation to find the missing links. Without this ledger, even we would not know how much funds were going into where, in what way.Therefore, this ledger was a key of sorts and the only documents that proved we were the owners of those companies. We moved to the copy machine, as Jonathan needed copies.\u201cDo you regret this?\u201d\u201cNo, Sun. I\u2019m just letting things happen after meeting you. We made so much money that it feels unreal.\u201dWhile Jonathan was saying such things, his face was as rigid, when he first took out the documents.\u201cJonathan, it will be at least three years before a tax investigation, and there is a high possibility that it won\u2019t happen. Even if it does, what\u2019s the probability that everything will be discovered?\u201d\u201cWhat if the worst happens? If someone steps on our tail\u2026\u201d\u201cIf that day comes, let\u2019s stamp them out with money.\u201d\u201cStamp them out with money?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re doing these things to earn money for such operations.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what comes first and what comes later now.\u201d\u201cHere, have them.\u201dI handed the copies to Jonathan. The sound of the copy machine whirring did not stop, and I started to cross check the documents that had been copied with the accounts that held much of our funds. Our paper companies were spread all over the global tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands, Bahamas, Switzerland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Bermuda, and Hong Kong. Then there were core companies such as Gold Wish, established in the Bahamas, a small island country southwest of Florida.Rich people were living like royalty in large manors that were surrounded by palm trees, but how many of them had the dollars that had been poured into Gold Wish?The monitor screen brightened, and the Bahamas account opened.[Registered Business Name: Gold Wish]\\n[Account Balance: $ 3,000,000,000]Then the transfer history of how the 3 billion dollars were collected was shown. Five paper companies owned Gold Wish shares, and the firm names in the transfer history matched those in the documents.All the paper companies were like this, and Jeon il Investments, which will enter Korea, was the same. Jeon il Investments will be established in the same manner as Gold Wish, which means that five paper companies will invest equally to Jeon il.The plans to place 10 billion dollars in Jeon il Investments had been finished, despite the fact that the funds would have to be deposited in messy divided amounts.\u201cYou confirmed the Bahamas account, right?\u201dI asked Jonathan.\u201cGold Wish?\u201dOf course, Jonathan knew the name of the core company that had its roots in the Bahamas.\u201cYes, it\u2019s clean. You must have paid a lot of commission fees.\u201d\u201cDirty means clean in this field.\u201d\u201cWhere did you learn expressions like those, Sun? Anyway, I\u2019m also satisfied with the results. If that\u2019s not art, what is?\u201d\u201cWhat firms made them?\u201dJonathan named several legal and accounting firms that would do anything for money. I selected one of the firms that were in charge of the final division process.\u201cIt would be better to buy this firm out and place it under Jonathan Investments.\u201d\u201cWhile shopping is nice, you will run out of funds if you buy everything you want. There are only 10 billion dollars left in the New York company.\u201dJonathan smirked at having said only 10 billion dollars, and it was the first time his expression loosened after being rigid for so long.\u201cAfter October, our coffers will be full.\u201d\u201cOctober?\u201d\u201cI wish that you\u2019ll stay here with me until then.\u201d\\n\u201cWhat about the New York company? Do I trust the desk team?\u201d\u201cWhat does it matter when the orders come from here? The problem is whether they will follow orders without doing anything else, as I had emphasized loyalty.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry for saying this, but they are failures who have been fired after losing huge amounts of money for their firms and clients.\u201dJonathan meant that according to his calculations, they had been crushed down by their failures and would not risk their only lifelines by disobeying our orders. I nodded and moved to the safe.\u201cYou must be tired, so please find somewhere you can rest. Also, use only cash and not credit cards from now on.\u201dThe safe unlocked with the crisp sound of heavy bolts being thrown, and there were stacks of ten thousand won bills inside.\u201cLike criminals?\u201d\u201cLike real billionaires.\u201d\u201cSame difference.\u201dJonathan was right. I still remembered a scene from a Korean film. While I did not remember the title, the movie was about a rich family\u2019s private lives. The film\u2019s protagonist was the secretary for the family, and one day had a chance to go into the safe where the family\u2019s slush funds were stored. It was a large walk-in safe, and ten thousand won bills filled all the shelves. The old woman, who was the head of the family, then tells the protagonist that he can take as much money as he wanted. While the protagonist had not done so to the end, Jonathan took the bills.He put bills in his pants pockets and inside his jacket and briefcase, but the amount was less than ten million won. (EN: Approximately $10,000 US)\u201cI\u2019ll check in to a hotel.\u201d\u201cOk, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201d \u201cCan we meet?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s school vacation.\u201dJonathan looked at me with astonished eyes, as he seemed to forget often that I was still a teenager.***I went to the building the next day, among those wearing suits despite the summer heat. The identification they wore like slave collars around their necks said in clear letters Daemin Bank. I went through the lobby with them and also rode in the same elevator.The first floor of the building was rented by Daemin Bank, the biggest bank in Korea. However, the entrance ordinary employees and the customers used went directly outside, they could not go through the building lobby. It meant that I was riding the elevator with board members or special employees.\\n \u201cDo you have anything else?\u201d\u201cThere are no similar movements in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Singapore.\u201d\u201cIf they got it all, they must have made loads of money. So, only Hong Kong is left.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThe attack on Hong Kong has started, but there isn\u2019t any news about it yet.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t trade in the morning market.\u201d\u201cThe morning market?\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t you hear me? They are gunning for Hong Kong! Come to the meeting room as soon as you finish the preparations. Let\u2019s go after them.\u201dThey are coming for us? I remained indifferent.

The drawing he saw yesterday must have made an impression on him, as he stood in front of it again.\u201cIt\u2019s detailed. You would succeed as a manhwa illustrator. Is there something you can\u2019t do? However, why did you draw a monster? Is there a reason?\u201dJonathan looked like he was evaluating art and was stroking his chin as he looked over the drawing inch by inch. Actually, he seemed like more of a psychologist examining a Rorschach inkblot?!\u201cThe size is about thirty meters.\u201d\u201cWere you inspired by Godzilla?\u201dThis abomination was similar to Godzilla, as it had not been even scratched after being hit by a 15 megaton thermonuclear warhead.The Eight Evils and Eight Virtues had to join forces for the first and last time when this monster had appeared, and I had watched the battle from a television with bad reception.Jonathan, you asked why I drew this monster. It is because this massive Kaiju reminded me of my enemies. It would be another twenty years before we see this monster again. During this battle I had felt existential dread, and my own insignificance from an entity which had withstood the ultimate technological might of humanity, the Thermal Nuclear Bomb, and survived. I also felt the vile strength of the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues, both hating myself for the feeling of relief as we were saved, and despising those humans who emulated the monster they had fought, regarding those lesser Awakened and simple humans as insects to be trod beneath them. I was certain this time around I will amass a wealth beyond belief and change the future completely.Human beings are like that, they need purpose and I hung that drawing to remind me of my enemies and my goals\u2026\u201cYou can have it if you want since I can draw another one.\u201dI took off the drawing and handed it over to Jonathan. If he held on to this until that day, he would naturally know how I could have drawn this picture. How I had become a \u201cGenius\u201d. I will not be able to hide from Jonathan after that day, and I will need comrades who I can trust explicitly, especially those who were Awakened.\u201cYou don\u2019t exercise much, right?\u201d\u201cMuscle guy, don\u2019t lecture me that trading is also a physical battle. Don\u2019t you know that exercise erodes vitality? There are parts of the human body that can be healed, and those that cannot be healed. Why do you think athletes die young? It\u2019s because\u2026\u201dI let Jonathan\u2019s excuses run by, as the reason that Jonathan could pass the Trial Tests was not because of his strength or stamina. The damn Trial Tests were taboo among the awakened. There were incidents that could not be spoken of after the tests, and we had to do anything and everything to survive, and each moment tested our humanity.The reason why so many awakened had twisted personalities may have been this simple. Jonathan had been a survivor who had lived despite having ordinary physical abilities. However, people like him had been cunning.\\nWhile Jonathan probably had gained those instincts from Wall Street, he had changed after meeting me. I would need to train him hard when the time comes, so he would not fall behind during the Trial Tests.***\u201cAnyway.\u201dJonathan opened the door to a different room. He seemed to have explored our office while he waited for me. The office was divided into two spaces. One was my personal exercise room with my personal desk, exercise equipment, and drawings that Jonathan had been interested in. The other was the computer room that stored our weapons. There were ten tables, and each had one computer, five monitors, and an internet connection to the New York Stock Exchange.With other equipment, the room looked like the operations center of a major bank. The men in the elevator also worked in a space like this.\u201cWhere\u2019s my desk?\u201dJonathan asked me.\u201cHalf the room is yours and worth 25 billion dollars.\u201dJonathan immediately understood what I was saying.\u201cThere won\u2019t be any additional people, right?\u201d\u201cYes, there shouldn\u2019t be.\u201dWhy should we show others how we hid the funds when we had gone through so much trouble to obfuscate the trail in the first place? Jonathan and I would deal under various ghost company names from now on from these ten computers.\u201cHowever, it won\u2019t be as harsh as before.\u201d \u201cAll right, let\u2019s talk about that.\u201dJonathan sat on a chair and faced me.\\n\u201cI\u2019m planning to limit the leverage to the minimum.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good. The situation has changed.\u201dIt was not because of the massive increase in funds. I made the choice because history was changing from our intervention. As the baht had fallen on a larger scale than past history, the Hedge Fund Coalition and investors were more aggressive in attacking Southeast Asia. The Philippines peso, the Malaysia ringgit, and the Indonesia rupiah had been crushed simultaneously and not in succession. Events were happening faster than in the previous history.I could not use the method of guessing the exact date to use maximum leverage again. While I could no longer predict events exactly, I had no regrets.I had already gained 50 billion dollars from the investors\u2019 pockets, and while there would be changes in dates and numbers, the general trend was the same.That was why I was not trying to exploit the investors who were knocking on Hong Kong\u2019s backdoor from early August. I was anticipating the events in Hong Kong\u2019s October, when the investors\u2019 attacks reached maximum, that was our chance.\u201cYou can guess from the ongoing situation. The investors chose Hong Kong as their next goal and had begun operations as we expected.\u201d\u201cThe attackers will bleed.\u201dJonathan spoke the conclusion first, and his tone was full of confidence. I saw the expression I had seen when Jonathan had looked back on his heyday in 1997 Hong Kong in the future. I welcomed it.\u201cFrom the circumstances, China will not intervene.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s one more thing, Sun. The attackers will believe that the Hong Kong Government will do anything to protect the stock market.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t think so, Jonathan?\u201d\u201cHong Kong is familiar with Wall Street\u2019s offensive strategies, and they have the most elites after Tokyo in Asia. Also, Hong Kong has been under British rule until last month and they know how to think like the attackers. They also have endurance since they have about 100 billion dollars in their foreign currency reserves.\u201dHe was accurate, and Jonathan proved why his heyday had been 1997 Hong Kong. Being able to think like one\u2019s enemy was just as important as knowing yourself. The reason I had been able to irritate the Eight Evils and Eight Goods with my low level abilities had been because of that, as I had been able to predict what they\u2019ll do to a certain extent.\u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\\n \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\u201cYou have to listen to me to the end. Hong Kong giving up the foreign exchange market instead of their stock market would be what the attackers are thinking.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m\u2026surprised.\u201d\u201cYou are right. Hong Kong can think like that, which means that the answer is evident.\u201d\u201cSo, Sun you\u2019re saying\u2026\u201d\u201cIf I was the Hong Kong government, I would give up on the stock market instead of the foreign exchange market, to an extreme level that no one would be able to expect. They will raise the short-term interest rate to the maximum.\u201dI raised three fingers.\u201cA 3% increase?\u201d\u201cNo, 300%.\u201dJonathan\u2019s face cringed.\u201c300%? 300%! Sun, I believe whatever you say, but not this time. That\u2019s crazy. A child wouldn\u2019t do that.\u201dYes, if one read Economics for Dummies, you could know how crazy this idea was. However, Hong Kong was going to do exactly that.\u201cJonathan, Hong Kong will destroy their stock market by their own hands.\u201dEdited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, I\u2019m dead certain.\u201d\u201cSun, have you been planning like this until now?\u201d\u201cI see the material and think what my enemy would do, what their approach would be, and how my enemy\u2019s target would respond.\u201d\u201cHowever, to think that Hong Kong will break its stock market on its own\u2026\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s the most certain way to chase away the Hedge Funds.\u201d\u201cWill they give up easily? The damage will be unbelievable.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you what the Hedge Funds were after in the first place?\u201d\u201cKorea!\u201d\u201cYes, this country.\u201dActually, the hedge Funds wanted Japan the most, but how could they go after Japan when Hong Kong was such a formidable opponent? Japan was Asia\u2019s financial fortress, along with Hong Kong. Also, the USA would not allow Japan to be played by the Hedge Funds, even if they had to throw Korea to the wolves.***The reason that expert financiers, businessmen, and politicians had a comparatively high survival rate in the Trial Tests was not that complicated. Some people guessed that it was because of their renown. However, most of those who said such things had not even experienced the Trial Tests. In there, fame was nothing more than a weakness.They had a high survival rate because they could act strategically, as they had lived most of their lives on battlefields. They knew how to act to take things away and hold on to what they had. While I belittled the Hedge Funds, their real identity was elite financial groups who thrived by preying on the large global banks.Their final objective would be Korea. However, we had protected ourselves so the hedge funds and investors could not play tricks on us by creating a closed financial system. We blocked foreigners from intervening and investing, and they could not attack Korea directly.\\nTherefore, they went with a strategy that would crumble Korea from the inside by spreading fear by attacking Southeast Asia and finally by attacking Hong Kong, which seemed impregnable.Fear will overwhelm Korea, and the scared domestic investors will take back their investments. The foreign banks that had lent dollars to major Korean firms will scream to have the funds returned instead of extending their loan, saying that they had not entered a suicide pact with the Korean companies.Fear would lead to chaos, and rumors would start that Korea would be ruined as a country. The situation would worsen until Korea announced a moratorium, which was a sign that they were defeated. It was then the Hedge Funds would collect the profit they had nurtured over a long time.Now the strategy the Hedge Funds would use to attack an invincible opponent is obvious. The Trial Tests required such strategies, and some were skilled in such tactics, like the military, as well as financiers, businessmen, and politicians.One might have already guessed, but it was true. I had been a trader like Jonathan, and I also had worked at Wall Street for a time.***\u201cThe money we earned in Thailand is impossible to believe. 50 billion dollars came out of the baht market, which deals at 3 billion dollars. This is a historic incident in the financial field.\u201d\u201cThe words historic incident doesn\u2019t cover what we did.\u201dJonathan smiled faintly as he remembered that day.\u201cEveryone is paying attention to us, even if they do not know who we are or how we are structured.\u201d\u201cThey know that a group which monopolized everything exists.\u201d\u201cPeople all have habits, and that\u2019s true for trading too, Sun.\u201d\u201cI get what you\u2019re saying.\u201d\u201cWe have to keep in mind if our tail is caught, the trends will fall heavily in our favor.\u201d \u201cThat means we will be handing out what we could have gotten, right?\u201d \u201cIt will be alright if things stop there since we make a profit at least. My calculations and investments are based on past records, and as you will know, I prefer investing against the market. That will be true in the future.\u201d\\n\u201cWe hit the jackpot like that, Jonathan.\u201d\u201cWe can\u2019t move when we lead the trends. If many groups follow us, even I cannot estimate how the governments will change their financial policies.\u201dJonathan finally looked like he realized how much money we had earned in Thailand and how much renown we had gained in the global financial market. His face quickly darkened. Jonathan did not look like someone who had accumulated massive wealth, but someone who regretted that he could not be relied on.Jonathan met my eyes, and he again shook his head.\u201cSun, you\u2026\u201dI knew what Jonathan was going to say, and I interrupted first.\u201cJonathan, what did I say when you asked me whether I was planning to prevent the disturbance that will come to Korea?\u201d\u201cYou said that you only see the money.\u201d\u201cYes. Don\u2019t think about policy changes, unemployment rates, household debts, and anything else. Just work with the numbers in front of us.\u201d\u201cWe can ruin a country if we want, and the same thing will happen if we make a mistake, Sun.\u201d\u201cWe already have billions offshore.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have to remind me that we are criminals every time.\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m trying to say that all of this is the Major Leagues that you have always dreamed of.\u201dI spoke sincerely.\u201cHowever, feeling responsibility is good. Wall Street numbs that feeling. But don\u2019t be weak.\u201dJonathan will get used to this, as human beings all adjust to their present situation. This was the excuse that those who had murdered in the Trial Tests had made to others.\\n\u201cThat\u2019s true. However, I will make the banks accept our proposal by setting the standard at a 100% increase. If the increase goes over, we win, and under, the banks win.\u201d\u201cSun\u2026\u201d\u201cIt would be even more insane not to accept this offer. All of the banks will sign up as they sneer at us. They will call us idiots and pop the champagne to celebrate their victory.\u201dThose that had been willing to gamble on the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis had earned money like this. While sneering at them had been free, their earnings were immense. While we would be wearing expensive suits and waving around a thick wad of documents as we say that \u2018this is the result of cutting-edge financial acumen,\u2019 what we were actually doing was a gamble between us and the bank. We were going to repeat this performance multiple times against the major global banks.\u201cWho will refuse millions of dollars when it appears to them as a gift?\u201dJonathan let out a sign, and he nodded after a long time.\u201cWe will make the proposal even more appetizing. They can have the entire amount if the increase is under 100%, but we will apply profit in stages from 100% and above.\u201d\u201cIf things go your way, and the increase is 300%?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d get three times our investment.\u201d\u201cEveryone would go for this. Let\u2019s do it!\u201d\u201cAre you serious?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m saying that it is that appetizing. I\u2019ve heard of an even crazier thing than a 300% interest rate increase. When you told me to establish the company with my money and give you more than half of the shares was even more completely insane. Look where we are now. Anyway, I\u2019m in.\u201d\u201cThen begin the preparations.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll become famous that day, Jonathan.

Jonathan was one of the many who had just graduated from being a junior level broker and trader. Guys like him could be seen by the hundreds on Wall Street. Moreover, there had been recent rumors that Jonathan\u2019s past performance at both had been less than lackluster around her alumnus.Yet, impossibly, a guy like him had achieved an impossible success that would go down in financial history in the span of a single day. With a stake of less than a million dollars, Jonathan had pocketed ten billion dollars in just two months. It was an incredible record that would be forever unbroken.Jonathan? That Jonathan did this?She and other teammates talked about this whenever they ate together. While they spoke every day, the conclusion was always the same. There was only one way that Jonathan could have made such a nonsensical profit.As Jonathan had hinted, he had placed his entire fortune on maximum leverage. He had liquidated his assets in a suicidal manner, and unbelievably it had worked. It was miraculous luck, and even if gods of fortune such as Tyche from Greek mythology, Ganesha from Indian mythology, and others from all over the world had graced Jonathan, it still did not cover it. He was the monkey that had written Shakespeare. (EN: Tyche, in Greek religion, was the goddess of chance, a capricious dispenser of good and ill fortune. Ganesha is the Hindu god of wisdom, success and good luck. The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. In fact, the monkey would almost surely type every possible finite text an infinite number of times. ^_^ )\u2018He had been boasting and congratulating us on entering the major playing field\u2026and now he\u2019s having us perform this farce.\u2019Emily sighed as she looked down at her briefcase. She was certain that Jonathan was drunk in his success. Wall Street was full of people who overestimated momentary luck as an unbeatable winning streak, and Emily knew this better than anyone else. She had been one of them, and although she had repented, her ruin had become irrevocable.Therefore, she had come in running when Jonathan called her. Emily had thought this was her second chance at Wall Street, but\u2026\u201cReally, why?\u201dEmily wanted to throw her briefcase off the nearest bridge, as it was full of documents that proved she was an imbecile. When this bet is made between the banks and Jonathan Investments, her regained position will disappear.\u2018If he wants to throw money away like that, give it to me.\u2019Emily\u2019s destination was right in front of her, as she was at the head offices of DP Krump, one of the top four firms in the financial field. She had been pacing at the front of the door for thirty minutes even though it was almost time for her appointment. She had to stop Jonathan but had no way to contact him. She had strict orders to follow the instructions, and Emily grabbed her brick sized cell phone. (EN: This was the \u201890s. )\\nEmily thought she had made a mistake in making the call, as her mood became even gloomier. Eventually, she entered the massive bank like a cow walking into the slaughterhouse. The wait was not long since she had already scheduled a meeting.\u201cI\u2019m Emily from Jonathan Investments.\u201dWhile Emily offered her business card, she thought it would become useless soon. Only a single ordinary employee from DP Krump had come into the meeting, who did not even have the authority to make decisions. Emily placed the documents, and as the employee looked over them, he scratched his head and stroked his nose.\u201cIt\u2019s a new type of swap transaction, and you seemed to have prepared a lot.\u201dEmily agreed that this had taken much preparation, as she had been impressed by the expertise that had gone into Jonathan\u2019s product proposal. However, trash was trash.\u201cI have to tell you that I will look over this as usual, but I do not want to waste your time. Who will accept such a deal like this?\u201dThe employee was polite, and Emily thought it was inevitable that the DP Krump employee had misunderstood the proposal.\u201cJonathan Investments is position B, and we will take the position where we would only make profit when Hong Kong short-term interest rate increases over 100%.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dThe employee picked up the documents again, and she looked at his face while waiting for him to speak. It was just as Emily had guessed, as his facial muscles were working desperately to hide his laughter. He was doing his best to do so and quickly got out of the room, saying that he had no authority over this. Emily covered her reddening face.After a short while, new employees from DP Krump came in, and they had more weight this time. A team leader, who could make decisions, and three subordinates were added to the mix. They greeted each other, and the new people began to confirm the documents.\u201cA swap transaction of this kind is unprecedented. It takes a long time to create a new product, and to build such a market with Hong Kong bonds\u2026\u201d (EN: What is a swap transaction? A contract to exchange two financial liabilities. For example, swapping fixed interest-rate debts for variable-rate debts. They are commonly used to enable a borrower to change the basis of interest payments and will often incur a fee.)\\n\u201cWe are aware.\u201d\u201cHowever, since you had made such immaculate preparations, we can go about this with less work. How much money are we talking about?\u201dEmily inwardly shouted that now was the time to stop.\u201c500 million dollars.\u201dIt was an OBSCENE amount of money, and Emily knew that they were sneering at her at that moment. The DP Krump employees became busy with them, and the time they took to confirm there were no hidden tricks in Emily\u2019s product proposal took much more time than the first reading.\u2018There are none! Congratulations. You\u2019ve earned a humongous pile of dough just by sitting there on your fat a$$.\u2019Emily grabbed a pen, as only Jonathan\u2019s parents would refuse that worthless proposal. The highest ranking of the DP Krump people was also taking out a pen from his breast pocket and after they signed, he asked for a handshake.After the handshake, he asked a question.\u201cI know that this is impolite, but I have never heard of Jonathan Investments before.\u201d\u201cWe have been open for less than a year, and Jonathan Investments looks forward to an amicable partnership with DP Krump.\u201dBoth Emily and the DP Krump people were thinking the same thing. They would never see each other again. After the signature was on the proposal, Emily made her escape. While she could not actually hear the sound, she knew that the sneering laughter of DP Krump was following her. The worse thing was that DP Krump was not the end, and she had to fly to Europe to do this again.***\u201cConquest preparations complete.\u201dJonathan confirmed the email and turned his chair towards me. He had remained silent about my predictions about Hong Kong\u2019s crazy maneuvers from that day.\u201cWe\u2019ve bet 5 billion dollars.\u201dBonds were done, and it was now time for stocks.\\n\u201cHong Kong is Asia\u2019s financial center. What will happen when Hong Kong burns its stock market by its own hands?\u201dJonathan shook a little, as he understood what I was saying.\u201cThe entire world will be shocked, and what will happen if we \u2018encourage\u2019 that fear a little?\u201d\u201cSUN!\u201d\u201cThe global stock market will shake, and we will bet on it.\u201dIt could not be helped. While the Korean IMF crisis will come faster than in the previous history, it was an inevitable outcome even without my intervention. I started booting up the computers.\u201cWe will bet the five billion dollars when it\u2019s time. What you and I will do now is\u2026\u201d\u201cMove the ghost companies with the rest of the funds under the prediction that the global stock market will fall.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. While the most important thing is profit, another thing just as important is that no one knows about us. If someone discovers our tail, that means the end.\u201dAs we had accumulated this much in an instant, the fall could come just as quickly.\u201cThen let\u2019s start now. We don\u2019t have much time.\u201dThis was it, that familiar racing heartbeat. It was just like the times I had to open reward boxes with everything riding on the outcome, good or ill. I placed my hands on the keyboard with memories flying in my head.Then, the day came.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I smelled cup noodles again today in the offices, as I ran in after classes ended.The trash can was already full of empty cup noodle bowls and cola cans. On the other hand, Jonathan was glued to the monitor and had not even noticed me coming in. I could see his dismal aura from his back and the rushed movements he made with the mouse. His expression was the same.Jonathan had been like this the past few days. Our losses increased as the global stock market rose, and except for the Asian stock market, the global trend was on the rise. As for the funds, our investments were immense, so were our losses.I dropped my bag to make a sound, and Jonathan turned to me and spoke with a face that resembled a child caught stealing.\u201cYou could have coughed or something.\u201dJonathan covered the monitor he saw with his body, and I could see endless red numbers from the parts not covered. They all signaled losses, and it was natural for Jonathan to be conscious of losses. No one could remain impassive after such an enormous investment. Moreover, we had put in an astronomical amount of funds, and the losses were accumulating. Not even God would be indifferent in this situation.\u201cHow bad are our losses so far?\u201d\u201cYou know that the amounts are incomprehensible.\u201dWe had borrowed stock from firms all over the world and sold them, and it had taken two months to do so. It would take that much time to know exactly the total profit and losses since the size and date of each transaction were all different.\u201cIn a general manner.\u201d\u201cI think we\u2019re deep in the red.\u201dI nodded and sat in a chair, and Jonathan stared at me with a surprised look. I had never sat in front of a computer after making the bet on the global stock market falling. From that day on, this space had been Jonathan\u2019s only, and I always exercised in the other room. Jonathan must have felt something at me suddenly sitting in a chair.His eyes opened wide, and I could see the whites. That\u2019s right, Jonathan.\u201cLet\u2019s attack Hong Kong.\u201dThe house was going to burn, and we would pour oil so it would become a bonfire. We became very busy from then on, and Jonathan and I moved between computers that had already been setup. We opened one paper company account per computer and threw oil in amounts ranging from 100 million to 1 billion dollars. The only sounds were the keyboards clicking and the alarms signaling that the transaction was complete.From construction, communication, heavy industry, chemistry, and tourism, Hong Kong stock prices began to fall at once in all fields except banking, which we did not touch on purpose. We needed to calm down Hong Kong banks at least a little.\\nSince the Hong Kong stock market had incurred attacks until now every day, it responded more actively to our provocation. It was then we looked at each other, and Jonathan spoke what I was going to say.\u201cThere are people tracking us!\u201dOur faces tightened for the first time after we began pouring oil into Hong Kong.\u201cDo you think we have been caught?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too early for anything! Jonathan!\u201d\u201cSpeak!\u201d\u201cNew York has to defend us! Have them make our transactions for us!\u201dJonathan stood up, the chair flew to the wall and made a large bang. I looked carefully over the situation and stopped my trades. I could hear Jonathan speaking harshly in a loud voice in the outer office for a long time.Jonathan came running in. He only spoke with clenched teeth after sending emails to his team members.\u201cI sent the transaction list, and they will begin the transactions now.\u201d\u201cDid you have them waiting in advance?\u201dJonathan nodded.\u201cYou did well. Now, time will let us know who is following us.\u201dWhile we had been careful, if the people attacking Hong Kong had found us, things would have been bad. However, if some smart investors at the stock market were doing this as a strategic maneuver, it would stop. Which was it?It was then the defense funds from Jonathan Investments began flowing into the Hong Kong stock market. Jonathan bit his nails as he glared at the monitor.\u201cIt\u2019s calming down. Damn, I lost ten years of my lifespan\u2026The Hong Kong stock market would have been crushed.\u201d\\n\u201cLet\u2019s finish up when the market closes since we will have spread enough fear.\u201dMy voice was also weak. If our provocations had been too much, it would have meant the end of us. However, fortunately, things calmed down, and now we only needed to wait for the Hong Kong government to make a quick decision. I did not know whether it would be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.However, it was that night when I heard Jonathan shout at me as I prepared to go home.\u201cSun, you were wrong!\u201dHe screamed at me as if he had the biggest surprise of his life\u2026***Clive, who was the general manager at DP Krump, was excited about receiving performance benefits at the end of the year. The stress from the losses he incurred in Thailand had been washed away by the proposal those idiots had brought.\u201cThe name was Jonathan Investments.\u201dClive spoke in a happy voice to an acquaintance in a Wall Street salon.\u201cYou can say that again. I can\u2019t believe it. How can one possibly think to earn profit by betting that the Hong Kong interest rates increase by over 100%?\u201d\u201cThose were the most unbelievably stupid idiots I have ever seen.\u201d\u201cHow much did they bet?\u201d\u201c500 million dollars.\u201d\u201cThey are insane. That is the stupidest way I have ever heard of throwing away money. Congratulations my friend, you have made an astronomical profit just by sitting there. News about Hong Kong is just coming up.\u201dClive called the salon employee and generously tipped him to turn up the volume. However, he did not need to, as the bold letters in the lower part of the screen made every Wall Street guy open their eyes.[Breaking news: Hong Kong raises short-term interest rates by 400%.]\\nAn answer came back from somewhere.\u201cWhere did things go wrong?\u201dHowever, no one could answer that question. (EN: You bet against Sun and Jonathan. ^_^ )***Jonathan pointed at the monitor as I ran to him, and bold letters burst from the financial information site he had opened.[Breaking news: Hong Kong raises short-term interest rates by 400%.]\u201cOh my\u2026\u201dExclamations came out of my mouth at that moment, as Hong Kong had increased their crazy ante by not 300%, but 400%.\u201cSun, you did it again! Jesus!\u201dJonathan shouted, and I felt my hands shake as I could not suppress the bursting emotions. That did not come from the money. The Hong Kong shock will hit the world, and there has never been such an event that changed the entire financial world like this before, excluding the Day of Advent and after the gates opened and the dungeons were unsealed.I threw back my bag and sat. It was true, as the entire global stock markets began to fall. The spot markets in countries with open markets and the futures markets in countries with closed markets were falling, and we were reaping in the profit![The Asian financial crisis is spreading with domino effects.][The second Black Monday.][Hong Kong, America, Japan, and Europe stock prices are falling.]No stock markets could avoid the fall I had engineered, and I had hit another jackpot. The absurd amount of money we made this year was only the beginning. While in my previous life, the trait the Man who Overcame Adversity and the skill the Devi\u2019s Sword had been considered Beyond Human Limits, money would be more powerful now. Especially in the future that I will create.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The Korean government had requested financial relief from the IMF. Since Korea was more sensitive to the situation with Hong Kong than other countries, things were going faster by two weeks from the previous history.There was other news. I had been certain that Jonathan would be the cover model of Forbes next month, and he did go back to New York for an interview with the magazine. He contacted me afterwards. (EN: The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is an international financial institution, headquartered in Washington, D.C., consisting of 190 countries working to foster global monetary cooperation, secure financial stability, facilitate international trade, promote high employment and sustainable economic growth, and reduce poverty around the world while periodically depending on the World Bank for its resources. Forbes is an American business magazine owned by Integrated Whale Media Investments and the Forbes family. Published eight times a year, it features original articles on finance, industry, investing, and marketing topics. )Forbes collected their list of the richest in the following manner. If the subject had established an undisclosed company, they listened to outside experts. If the subject is the CEO of a publicized company, they based their calculations on the stock prices at the time of research.Also, for people who had not established companies such as athletes, they estimated the subject\u2019s total assets based on past publicly disclosed earnings.Starting from next year, Forbes would exclude dictators with illicit wealth and royal families. Our New York company, Jonathan Investments, belonged to the first category.\\nThe paper companies we had separated into tax havens were not yet complete. We still had work left to do in order to make them seem actual companies rather than ghosts. If a special tax investigation came in at this time\u2026\\nThe fact we had provoked Hong Kong, causing the crash of the Stock Market had not been discovered. It had been done by our paper companies and accomplished by our proxies. If our hands had been revealed, the end of 1997 would be screaming with the greatest financial scandal in history.I felt pride in Jonathan, as he was still following me despite being my accomplice in the most unbelievably brazen and greatest act of financial manipulation in history, since the Dutch Tulip Mania. He went on speaking.Jonathan became quiet, as while Forbes had listed us in the top twenty, we would be the two richest people in the world when considering the paper companies and the hidden funds in them. His silence meant that understanding.***Adolescence was a nice time to be young, as my classmates were still young even as they pretended to be old. Nations entered a crisis even when there were no gates and monsters. Would I have changed my viewpoint if I had children? Anyway, the only person who had mentioned the IMF and the foreign exchange crisis in the classroom was my homeroom teacher.The teacher spoke about it for a while in front of immature children who only thought of girls and fights. No one was interested. I discovered the global edition of the Forbes at the newsstand in front of the office after school. Jonathan really looked like a successful investor as he smiled to the readers with his hands cupping his chin at his Wall Street desk.Forbes had named him \u2018The God of Investments,\u2019 and had not hesitated to use the word \u201cGod\u201d. Respected technical journals placed meaning on each word and went through editing multiple times. However, Jonathan\u2019s interview mentioned the word \u201cGod\u201d more than twenty times.While this was unprecedented, no one in Wall Street would oppose Jonathan\u2019s nickname now. A New York company had succeeded in an investment only God or a prophet could make. The New York firm\u2019s future was brighter than ever, and the richest of the world would be beating down the doors even at this moment.When I finished Jonathan\u2019s interview, I heard a man\u2019s voice next to me.\u201cHello.\u201dHe was familiar, and that slave-like ID card around his neck made me realize the reason. He was a member of the Foreign Exchange Management Team at Daemin Bank. We had crossed each other\u2019s paths a few times.\\n\u201cHe looks like your colleague.\u201dThe man was talking about Jonathan, as he had also seen Jonathan a few times during the past few months as he had seen me.However, things ended there. The man could not match the handsome cover model of Forbes with the shabby, often dead-tired foreign man. I just nodded and walked away and I didn\u2019t care if he thought me a rude rookie.I had no reason to form personal relationships with anyone in this building, and someone was waiting for me in the lobby. I recognized her in an instant, as she had the looks I requested.She was beautiful right out of a romantic film, and her long and curvy figure could not be hidden even under the thick winter coat. She was sitting on a bench and reading a magazine, and the scene looked like a photoshoot.The young building guards and everyone coming to the building were glancing at her. She raised her head when I stood in front of her, and I offered a handshake.\u201cMs. Jamie?\u201dWhile she looked Asian, Jamie would not know Korean since she had been born and raised in America. We used English.\u201cI have been waiting.\u201dI had ordered three conditions for the person who would be the CEO of Jeonil Investments. First, she had to be recognized for her skills in a large real estate investment or counseling firm. Second, she had to be a beautiful Asian woman. The third was the important part, as I asked for someone who would let illegal transactions pass for her success. I had been looking for someone who met these conditions since August and finally found her.While many fit the first two articles, the third was hardly something I could post in the job description. I had to find the lies in their resumes and use black money to access the trial records. In other words, she was an ex-convict who had been released recently.She had served a short-term imprisonment for professional negligence and malpractice for looking the other way at her employer\u2019s embezzlement, who had been the CEO of the firm.Humans did not change even after prison. I took her to a nearby caf\u00e9. She walked next to me like a tourist since it was the first time she had been to Korea. She seemed to understand why she had been called to Korea and looked like she enjoyed herself as she watched the tall buildings and stores.All the real estate in this street looked like bargain sale items at a one-time price sale to her predator\u2019s eyes. She asked me a question when we arrived at the caf\u00e9.\u201cIs it you?\u201dShe understood that no one else was waiting for us and sat across from me with a bright smile.\u201cYou\u2019re the interviewer.\u201d\\nAs I expected, Jamie\u2019s shoulders shook, and her slightly fisted hands on the table also trembled. This was a big chance for her, and I thought she would shout in joy as her lips opened. She quickly composed herself and asked me a question.\u201cCan I have the material so I can confirm?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dI took out a document folder among unnecessary middle school textbooks.\u201cJeonil Investments is divided by Gold Wish, Seiram, Turors, Ichi, and Truth\u2026\u201dI began to explain after naming the paper companies that were our core ones. Jamie\u2019s hand stopped flipping pages, which was when she confirmed the funds that will go into Jeonil Investments. Her eyes shot wide open.Unbelievable, a chance like this could not come to me. My becoming CEO for a firm like this has to be a trick. I read her mind.\u201cI, I have never heard of these firms before.\u201dJamie\u2019s voice shook as she pointed at the paper companies that held Jeonil Investments\u2019 shares.\u201cThey are officially investment firms that have been recently established.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThey are built in the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Netherlands. This is the extent I can tell you, as I have to protect my clients\u2019 secrets.\u201dI handed Jamie a fake name card of a paper company. She will understand that this was hot money, and the dollars of the rich were coming into Korea through tax havens. Well, she was not wrong.\u201cI will not intervene in Jeonil Investments, as I believe that you will satisfy my clients with your performance.\u201dI took a document out of my bag and handed it to her.\u201cHowever, there will be special orders like this one. You have to place them at top priority and have to execute them. Do so immediately when the Korean real estate market opens.\u201dWhile money was good, these were more important. They were Korean dungeons.Edited By UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She did not question why I had Jeonil\u2019s company credit card issued since she had already realized that Jeonil was not an altogether clean company. For the price of fame and wealth, Jamie would remain silent about the illegal activities.The company card was the first step, and as I held the plastic card with Jeonil\u2019s name on it, my money worries completely disappeared.\u201cPlease have cash ready in the linked account. You will not receive reports of how the money was used.\u201dJeonil\u2019s money was all mine and not mine at all at the same time. These were company funds, and if not used for managing the company, it immediately becomes embezzlement.However, Jamie did not even blink and acted like she had already anticipated the situation.\u201cThis country is nice for establishing firms. I knew it from the first, but the more I learn, the more I like it.\u201dObviously thinking ahead, Jamie next mentioned the best accounting firm and legal firm in Korea, Samwoo Accountings, and Kim &amp; Park Law.\u201cThese two firms will solve most of the problems in this country for us, and I confirmed their ability. I hired these guys as the first step for Jeonil.\u201dJamie handed over two profile files, and she had hired Daehwan Cho as the Accounting Director and Chungsik Park as the Legal Director. These two men were acknowledged to be the top in their fields and were partners in their firms, and they were expected to aim for vice-CEO or CEO in a few years. They had committed to give up their positions to join Jeonil.While they could not make illegal things legal, they would be able to make them look legitimate.\u201cHowever, there are conditions. They will not move until the head office receives funds. They are insuring themselves, as they are unable to believe that fifteen billion dollars will really come into this country.\u201dJamie looked at me straight, and I could see that she also wanted confirmation.\u201cYou do not need to worry about that, as the money will come in stages.\u201dI spoke while holding the company card. Jamie must have researched the situation Korea was in during the past few days.\\n\u201cAre you excited?\u201dI asked frankly, and Jamie nodded.\u201cDo you think I can manage this?\u201d\u201cI believe that position makes the person.\u201d\u201cI am grateful that you gave me this chance, and I won\u2019t let you down. I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u201dShe had meetings all day today, and the first was at the Blue House with the Secretary of Civil Affairs. The President was at the end of his term and he and the President-elect who just won the election yesterday were waiting for her. I spoke as she stood up.\u201cYou have to mention that the real estate market needs to be opened quickly.\u201d***\u201cThis is the first time there has been a change in the ruling party, and the President-elect has won this election in his fourth attempt. However, the President-elect now has to face the burden of rebuilding our economy. Our first news is the press conference the President-elect held in the Blue House.\u201dThe footage came after the anchor\u2019s briefing, and Jamie appeared from the beginning. She was shaking hands with the current President and then the President-elect. Based on the short clip, the star of the news report was not the President-elect but Jamie.Jeonil Investments was mentioned at the end of the press conference. The overall tone was that the New Government had succeeded in attracting an investment that was worth about fifteen billion dollars and will overcome the current financial crisis with investments like this.The next day was Saturday, and Jamie came into my office for the first time. One sees exercise equipment first when coming in, and her response was similar to Jonathan\u2019s. I spoke to her as she was busy looking around the office.\u201cCongratulations, Jamie. You have become the most sought after person in the political and financial fields in this country.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I can\u2019t reveal my face once I head out to my hotel.\u201d\\nAnyone with a name in Korea wanted to meet her, and that was why she came in with her face hidden with a hood.\u201cThe two men I mentioned yesterday confirmed that they will work for us.\u201dDaehwan Cho from Samwoo and Chungsik Park from Kim &amp; Park made quick decisions, as they were faster than anyone else at smelling out the money.\u201cMy former colleagues will come to Korea this evening. I finished negotiating with the real estate consultancies in this country and only need an office\u2026\u201dJamie\u2019s eyes widened as her eyes followed the exercise equipment, and saw how much the weights were set for. She looked at the walls and windows carefully and mostened her lips as she stood near the window that had a view of the streets.\u201cDo you know that this lovely building is for sale? However, the prices will fall.\u201d\u201cYou will need to be careful with the timing. You cannot be too fast or too slow.\u201d\u201cHotels are busy, and my old competitors have all come to Korea.\u201dAs she had mentioned, the five-star hotels in Gangnam were doing brisk business. This was called a firesale, and it meant selling furniture after a house burnt down at a cheap price. Korea\u2019s situation was a few times worse. The fire was spreading, becoming fiercer, like a wildfire. The animals ran from the flames, and only charred corpses were left where the flames had swept.It was a feast time for eagles, as they only needed to choose which prey was juicier and tastier. Since there was so much to eat, there was no need for eagles to fight. As they considered the choices, the flames spread even further to provide them with more prey.\u201cMy specialty is real estate, but I find it lacking to only invest in it. A chance like this will never come again.\u201dShe looked at the upper part of the building across us, and I could see employees busily working from afar. How many would survive?\u201cEthan.\u201dJamie used the English name I had presented to her in the fake business card.\\nJamie looked like she completely understood my rules.\u201cI recommend you headhunt the business loan teams from the three largest banks as your recruits. Bring another list.\u201d***On the last day of the year, in my previous life, my father came home drunk. While he had not mentioned it to us, he had been sentenced to a forced voluntary resignation at a young age. I still remember the day Father came in, supported by Mother. However, today Father came in alone with a laugh.I could smell liquor from his breath, and he sat down at the entrance without even taking off his shoes. He called Mother, and when she took off his shoes, he lay down on the floor. Mother looked at Father with a worried face that said that the inevitable bad news had come.Mother became aware of me, and she stopped my father from talking.\u201cCome to your senses. Sunhoo is here.\u201dMother had sensed that a dark shadow had fallen over our family, and she didn\u2019t want him to say that he had been fired in front of me.However, what Father said was different from Mother\u2019s expectations.\u201cCan I change companies? Can I?\u201d\u201cYou can do whatever you want. I said that Sunhoo is here. How much did you drink?\u201d\u201cYour husband will go to a better company! Those bastards are the problem!\u201dI heard my father make a sound that either could be a laugh or a cry.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had not been able to get back to the financial field when I entered university. However, our lives had not been that bad. Mother had rented a small store with Father\u2019s severance pay, and that had been an admirable choice. My middle school years, therefore, were comfortable considering the era. I had good memories of bringing friends to my parents\u2019 supermarket and giving them an armful of snacks.I would organize the store with Father after school, and he would teach me finances and take me to the bank with him. He had even opened a stock account for me, which was quite amazing.My father had taught me well and helped me to see my dream when I did not know what to do. I always respected my father and my mother, who became tough from managing the store.I managed to get into a famous university and major in what I had always wanted thanks to them and had been able to survive the Trial Tests.\u2026\u2026It had been like that.***Chungsik Park\u2019s eldest son opened his mouth after he saw his chance.\u201cI heard something strange yesterday.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cDo you know Jeonil Investments?\u201d\u201cHow can one not? You should also pay attention to that company.\u201d\u201cAre you going there as Director?\u201d\u201cWho told you that?\u201d\u201cWho else? From District Director Cho.\u201d\\n\u201cHe speaks freely, and he told you?\u201d\u201cIs it true?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s my decision, what I do with my life is my concern. I have already paved your path wherever you want to go in life.\u201d\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cWhat!\u201d \u201cHow\u2026could you make such a decision without telling us? You were being considered for a cabinet post, and this is an important time for you.\u201dChungsik Park slammed his spoon down, and other family members quickly escaped from the table.\u201cDistrict Attorney Park.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t see the situation, can\u2019t you?\u201dChungsik Park glared at his eldest son and then sighed.\u201cI\u2019m worried. We don\u2019t even know who owns Jeonil Investments. It will be a blemish on you, and I did do my research.\u201d\u201cAre you saying that you\u2019re the only one with brains? You won\u2019t rise up the ladder, Attorney Park if you hold other people in contempt.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cJeonil Investments. As you say, it\u2019s a shady foreign investment firm. Who knows whether it\u2019s drug money or oil money? I don\u2019t need to know that. However, what do you think money without a clear origin is called? Blind money.\u201d\u201cMoney? So, this was all about money? You have enough already.\u201d\\n\u201cYou\u2019re making up the answers to your own questions, so what more do I need to say?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re risking your honor. What should I do? Should I pretend not to notice and congratulate you on earning money by bowing down to Drug Lords or the Oil Companies?\u201d\u201cBe insolent one more time. You know I have a temper.\u201d\u201c\u2026I apologize, but you\u2019re not alone. You taught us that your actions reflect on the family, and the family\u2019s actions reflect on you, and I\u2019m teaching my own kids that.\u201dChungsik Park wanted to lose his temper but stopped because his son was saying the right things. His fame and power will go to his children, and theirs will come to him. The family had to stand together in all things, and the family\u2019s success was his own. He had taught his children like that as they grew up. Chungsik Park\u2019s words were mellower when he spoke.\u201cAttorney Park, open your eyes. Power has changed hands.\u201d\u201cYes, he has finally been elected.\u201d\u201cNo, he\u2019s a poor guy without any luck.

Your father will become the eyes of the blind dollars.\u201dBy becoming a Director of Jeonil Investments.\\n \u201cYou know of them?\u201dThe deputy asked in surprise. If my Father had been with them, he would have made the same expression.\u201cCome to my office since it\u2019s so cold.\u201dWhile the real estate market would have opened in June 1998, according to original history, due to my intervention, it had been opened just recently. Foreigners could now buy Korean real estate. Jeonil was underway, and I had been waiting for Jamie to contact me.They were in fact my employee\u2019s employee\u2019s employee\u2019s employees, or shorter, my employees, three times removed. However, one of them was around my father\u2019s age, and there might be those who knew my father. I liked their confident and passionate faces, as my father had the same expression nowadays. My father also worked for Jeonil.I made them hot coffee, and they asked me ordinary questions like whether there were any inconveniences as a resident, would I continue to rent this office, and if so, wanted lower rent.I thought it strange that I treated them with respect, like how I\u2019d treat my father.I was becoming used to this age, and I was becoming less sharp. I could not go on drawing monsters, and that was why I had been waiting for Jamie\u2019s report on Hwaseong\u2019s hill and the dungeon that was sealed there.\u201cThank you for the coffee. While the times are difficult, a crisis can become an opportunity. We wish you well.\u201dThe Jeonil employees left, and left their business cards with me. I could not call Jamie, as she was never alone. She would be in meetings with those inside and outside the firm.She sent me an email last night and also this morning. Yesterday\u2019s mail said that the head office\u2019s inspection team would be visiting the building I resided in, and today\u2019s mail made my heart beat faster.[Subject: First item purchased.]The first item was Hwaseong\u2019s hill, and I had waited for this for a long time.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The weeds growing everywhere came up to my waist. Unnamed thorn bushes and trees blocked my path wherever I went. Blood seeped out of the light scratches they made as I made my way through them. Also, the ground was slippery as the snow had melted and frozen again, and another snowfall covered the treacherous patches of ice. I could not discern the dangers with my eyes.Unlike my past life the military, under the government\u2019s orders, had not dragged Awakened to the dungeon entrance. This place, decades ago from that time, was a drastically different place.***The government had been harsh the first time I had come to this hill in my past life. Martial laws had been enforced, and I had been the only one of the reserve forces who had been summoned. Because I had survived the trial tests, I had been managed under a stricter regimen than ordinary soldiers under the Ministry of National Defence. (EN: Sun is one of some 3 million men in South Korea\u2019s reserve forces. Every man who finishes his mandatory service is classified as a member of the reserve forces and required to serve as a reservist for another eight years.)It had been when the Awakened had been treated like the Ministry\u2019s strategic resources. There had been insufficient research, and no one knew how much we could do. No one knew how much potential we had, and if they had known earlier, they would have treated us in a completely different manner. They would have begged on their knees instead of ordering us at gunpoint.Anyway, this hill and dungeon had been under government management, and at first, we thought we had been transferred to a government research facility. We believed that we would become experimental rats and looked for a chance to escape.I still remember when we had decided we would kill to get away, and I had marked my targets with my eyes, letting my fellow Awakened know who I would take out. I was planning to kill the three young soldiers who were leading me. One of them had become a non-commissioned officer recently, and the other two were corporals.They held me at gunpoint, and I saw that they were scared at every movement I made, perhaps because of a prior incident. I waited for a chance. While I would most likely be shot and killed, I thought it would be better than being an experimental rat for the rest of my life.It had been natural that we had misunderstood this place as a secret government research lab, as there had been military facilities instead of this wild hill at the time. Even the dungeon entrance had been camouflaged as a temporary building with outer walls. While anyone would be suspicious of these facilities, the Korean government owned them.Due to their fear and alertness, there had been no chance until we moved into the structure hiding the dungeon entrance.Our plans to break out had been delayed, and so we were all alive when we stood in front of the dungeon entrance and we realized we had come not as rats but as soldiers.***\u201cSo where is the eagle\u2019s beak\u2026\u201dNo matter how much I tried to remember, it was useless when the hill was so different from my memories. There was no path, and I could not cut down every tree on this big hill. I therefore called Ilju Constructions, a local firm located at the bottom of the hill and near a rural village.\\n\u201cIt must have been a difficult trip. Hello, I am Cheolmin Choi.\u201dSince there were no navigation devices, he arrived at sunset after getting directions. He looked at my reddened face from the cold and waved me over into the cab of his truck. I warmed my body with the heater and I pointed him to the hill, and we drove through a narrow path after passing the village.It had been quite a dangerous ride until the middle of the hill.\u201cCars cannot pass from here.\u201dWe tried to drive as far as we could and after the car almost slid a few times from the steep incline Mr. Choi finally parked. While his face was rigid, his voice was still bright since I revealed that I managed the hill for the new owner.\u201cWe will start the construction here and carve a new entry path.\u201dI pointed at the construction area, and the size was larger than the man\u2019s expectations. It was work that had come in this IMF era, where no one had anything to do. He gulped so hugely that I could see his Adam\u2019s apple wobble.\u201cCan you do it? You have to start now, even though it is winter, because the scale is quite large.\u201dI called Ilju Constructions after looking over the regional information. While I should collect bids and spend time selecting the best bid, I wanted to do things quietly and quickly without any noise. From the man\u2019s surprise, he never led a project this big before.His surprise was inevitable since they were a small company. Therefore, he had to win this project at all costs. His voice was urgent in his answer.\u201cOf course!\u201dThe size of the company did not matter, as many companies were suffering because they could not win bids. If a company managed to secure a contract, they would be able to temporarily expand their size, by calling on a team they had gone drinking with a while back, a team they had worked with before, and call up another team that someone knew. Everyone was hungry for work.We went back to the car again, and I handed him the Jeonil Investments business card. I was not wearing a suit, and my face was young, even if I was big. I did not look trustworthy, and the man\u2019s attitude became even more careful at the business card.I had no need to show him the documents that said I owned the hill, but since I had to show it anyway, I took out the document file from my bag. Logging and cultivation need a permit from the regional government and an approved program.\\nThe man looked at the file and then carefully stared at me desperately, and I did not need to explain that I held all authority over the decisions for the construction project.\u201cI\u2019m looking for a firm that will also apply for the permit, and that\u2019s why I asked you whether you can handle this and give me an estimate.\u201d\u201cI can!\u201dThe man\u2019s fingers were shaking, and while his voice was loud, it also shook.\u201cI cannot give you much time since this was a sudden change for us. That\u2019s why we\u2019re using regional firms without collecting bids, but it does not mean we will use any firm we see. Do you understand?\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201d\u201cCan I get the estimate by tomorrow?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll call you on this number!\u201d\u201cThe hill needs to be cleared without landscaping. Plan your estimate that way, and also\u2026\u201d\u201cYes!\u201d\u201cDo you do buildings?\u201d\u201cWe can do anything!\u201d\u201cThen you can also pave roads.\u201dThe man fell silent for a minute and only blinked his eyes. I could hear his nostrils flaring through the engine. Taking a hill, paving a road, and constructing a building? It was for him a chance in a lifetime, and he could see the golden rope clearly laid in front of him.\\nA fence would disturb the village, as there would be threatening warning signs everywhere and surveillance cameras with blinking red lenses. What village would be silent about that?We can\u2019t risk someone seeing the dungeon by going up the mountain!\u201cThe entire area?\u201d\u201cYes, I\u2019m planning to completely control entry so no one can enter the hill.\u201dIt was almost unprecedented that a regular hill would be controlled like that, and Mr. Choi looked surprised enough to not know what to say.\u201cSince we\u2019re a foreign firm, we can be abrupt at times. Things will go to court if something bad happens, so we should build them a village hall. Instead of someone as young as me, please explain the matter well to the village elders. That means that I will also entrust the village hall to you.\u201dMr. Choi again showed teary eyes at my words, and it was not because he cried easily. The economy was so bad that he had to have been worrying about how to feed his family before meeting me.\u201cWell\u2026\u201dMr. Choi composed himself like he was embarrassed, and he looked for a cigarette in his pocket.\u201cWe should go downtown together and speak about the rest in a warm place with coffee\u2026\u201dI will build walls with reinforced concrete at the entrance, emplace barbed wire fences surrounding the walls, and install surveillance cameras. I had to make this spot secure to a military level, so nothing can come in or out. I should buy a large construction firm after Mr. Choi finishes the basic facilities, as that\u2019s specialized construction.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The news also reported that the major corporations were liquidating their foreign branch properties to reduce overhead, prioritizing their head offices. Not a day went by quietly at the end of January 1998, and Japan, considering Korea\u2019s serious financial crisis as an opportunity, broke fishing agreements from their side.While the exchange rate had fallen to 1500 won, this was a temporary illusion created by the International Monetary Fund negotiations.My daily routine began with reading the newspapers to confirm how history was changing with my intervention. The major flow had not changed from the previous history, but minor details were different now.For example, foreign firms were purchasing Korean real estate quickly. While Jeonil had advanced the date by six months with the promise of large investments, I could see names I had not read in the domestic real estate market in the past.[Foreign firms such as Jeonil Investments, DP Krump, Deutsche Bundesbank, GOA, and the Bluestone Group are purchasing domestic real estate.]GOA, ANG Bearing, Silverman Fox, Standard Bank, and the Bluestone Group had been the first flight of eagles who had come to loot a burning country in the previous history. However, DP Krump and Deutsche Bundesbank had not been included. They had been more focused on acquiring firms rather than buying real estate, and they would have been active in Korea from the second quarter of this year when domestic firms failed to survive the flames. The government was buying time by deciding which companies would be allowed to survive, manipulating the commercial tax rates to let smaller companies fail, while the big corporations were allowed to survive, the rationale being they employed more people.They had aggressively entered the domestic real estate market from the first quarter. The reason was obvious, which was that they were trying to recoup their losses. They had all lost big on my Hong Kong bet and would have lost a lot in Thailand\u2019s and Hong Kong\u2019s future foreign exchange market.There were two facts I was certain of in the ongoing Asian financial crisis. Those large financial firms had all attacked Asia countries and also suffered much more loss than gains. I had a large portion of the dollars they had used so aggressively, so the firms would be desperate to get as much as they could from Korea, which they had cultivated for a long time.In the past, those firms would have thought of Korea as the land of gold and honey, but now they just wanted to make up for their losses. Well, it was true that the entire country was for sale if one only had enough dollars.***Daehwan Cho had a close relationship with Chungsik Park from the beginning, as they went to the same high school and university. Also, Daehwan Cho\u2019s eldest son had married Chungsik Park\u2019s youngest daughter, so they were related as inlaws.They began to call each other by different names after joining the ranks of the powerful, which was their way of celebrating their newfound good fortune. Of course, the reason that Daewhan Cho began to call Chungsik Park as Director Park was due to Jamie\u2019s decision to hire Chungsik Park and Daehwan Cho for Jeonil, and that carried over naturally into their private lives. One did not know when the dollar would become the center of power, but given Korea\u2019s financial crisis, it wouldn\u2019t take long until foreign money took over the country. They had merely joined the winning side.\u201cRegarding Pyeongdong Construction, the Senior Secretary of Civil Affairs is nagging me constantly. Isn\u2019t Secretary Cheolmin Kim your university alumnus, Director Park?\u201d\\n\u201cYes.\u201dDaehwan Cho and Chungsik Park were drinking in their favorite private room at their favorite restaurant.\u201cHe called me three times today. Why is he working so hard when his term ends next month?\u201d\u201cPlease let him be. He has to be busy. He\u2019s going for the general election at Gangnam.\u201d\u201cHe should just stay quiet when public opinion is like this.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. So, what about Pyeongdong? Does the estimate work?\u201dDaehwan Cho held his glass. Even before Jamie had expanded Jeonil\u2019s horizon to include firm buyouts, major firms, including Pyeongdong Construction, had been his close clients. He had worked as an executive director in the best accounting firm in Korea and had gone in as counsel when Pyeongdong Construction had bought International Construction in the late eighties. So, he knew them well.Chungsik Park read Daehwan Cho\u2019s complicated expression and smiled with wrinkles in his eyes.\u201cI do not owe Cheolmin any favors, so I\u2019ll just go by the rules. There are so many companies like Pyeongdong these days.\u201d\u201cHe has connections in the cabinet even if he does not win the next general election.\u201d\u201cDo you know that his nickname is the Eel?\u201dCheolmin Kim would inevitably slither his way up, and Daehwan Cho heard Chungsik Park\u2019s voice brighten. While he had said to go by the rules, those were his actual thoughts. Daehwan Cho asked a question.\u201cWhy did he call me directly and not through you?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s saying that he doesn\u2019t want to owe me a favor.\u201d\\n\u201cHe knows that you and I are in the same boat from a long time ago.\u201d\u201cNow, we are together in an actual boat. Cheers to our Jeonil Investments.\u201dThey clicked glasses, and Daehwan Cho spoke again.\u201cI\u2019ll try to breathe life into Pyeongdong. Cheolmin Kim, he\u2019s too good a card to throw away.\u201d\u201cIt will be difficult. Can you make it happen?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take care of our young CEO if you will take care of the foreigners that she had brought with her\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s bad. You know through multiple tries that the foreigners have rigid mindsets that won\u2019t work the way we do. Cheolmin is not that worthy of a card, to collect a favor in return. It\u2019s high-risk and low-return.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cWait for a bit until something comes up that Cheolmin can display to the voters as his achievement, but isn\u2019t enough to excite the foreigner\u2019s greed.\u201dDaehwan Cho nodded. It would be hard to get Cheolmin Kim to accept something so minor that the foreigners would allow it. The problem was that those would not pass Jamie\u2019s eyes, who had handled massive funds in her Walshire Land career, where she learned her predator\u2019s instincts and made her bones.Daehwan Cho looked over Chungsik Park\u2019s face, and the latter was deep in thought. It was then inspiration came in an instant. The television that had been on without sound was showing a Daehoo Motors . He saw the Daehoo logo, and at that moment, Daehwan Cho completely ignored the world, his brain working furiously.\u201cDo you have a good idea?\u201dWhile Chungsik Park had asked him a question, Daehwan Cho did not even hear it, and Chungsik Park remained silent. It was good to see Daehwan Cho focus so much that he could not hear anything like a youngster. It was because of that talent Daehwan Cho succeeded without background or money and had become the father in law of his daughter.Daehwan Cho\u2019s mouth opened.\\nI nodded and wiped my sweat with a towel. The best way to modify my stats was to go through gyms and spar with pro athletes before entering the dungeon. However, I could not do so anymore because rumors had begun to spread.She removed her hood and blew on her hands. She had become more beautiful during the time I had not seen her, and while she must be worn out, she knew how to enjoy work and public attention.\u201cDidn\u2019t you come by car?\u201d\u201cI came here because I had a meeting nearby.\u201dJamie said she had met with the Senior Secretary of Economy and had been in a meeting all morning in a Japanese restaurant instead of the Blue House. That had been the reason she had hung up in the morning. She sat and told me a name.\u201cDo you know the Daehoo Group?\u201dI did not understand why she would be saying that name around now. In late 1999, Daehoo was affected by the IMF crisis, and before that, they had been the second-largest group in Korea and was the center of our economy. Daehoo had been even more famous than the largest group, Daehyeon, overseas.Daehoo had earned serious recognition on the world stage.\u201cWhy would I not know Daehoo? Did you put Daehoo on the list? The government has to save Daehoo, Daehyeon, and Ilsung.\u201dJamie smiled meaningfully at my words.\u201cDaehoo\u2019s president will be under arrest tonight.\u201dI was surprised. Why? Daehoo did not dissipate just because of the IMF, and they had already been circling the drain. It would be next year when everything clicked together and blew up. How can that be happening tonight?\u201cI have much to tell you about that.\u201dJamie\u2019s voice was full of confidence. So, Daehoo would be disposed of in the first half of this year. I had fluttered the wings of a butterfly, but I did not know what made the hurricane hit Daehoo.\u201cA sudden arrest warrant? I need to hear about this.\u201dEdited by Userunfriendly, the butterfly.

Daehoo had at least superficially seemed to grab the IMF crisis as an opportunity. They had bought Ssangho Motors to expand their automobile business and expanded overseas. The number of foreign branches was about four hundred before the group was torn into pieces.Unlike my paper companies that existed only on documents, those branches were actual companies. I had been an ordinary middle school student then and had not been interested in Daehoo\u2019s dissolution as much as I had been interested in girls. I had understood the weight of Daehoo\u2019s name at university, as my professor had worked for Daehoo as did many others. He was one of Daehoo\u2019s legal counsels, and the legal fees they paid him would let him live without money worries until he died.Therefore, he was biased toward Daehoo, and believed that Daehoo had broken up not because of the IMF or negligent management but due to the government. He fervently believed that Daehoo\u2019s breakup led to our economic development being delayed over twenty years.Well, it had not been only my professor who thought so, and almost all of my conservative professors who thought that the government should be hands-off the Conglomerates used Daehoo\u2019s breakup to attack the progressives. The funny thing was that the attacks actually worked.***\u201cI told you that the first thing I did as CEO was to hire Korean directors.\u201d\u201cDaehwan Cho and Chungsik Park.\u201dJamie\u2019s eyes widened a bit when I said their names. She was thinking about how I remembered those names she had only briefly mentioned and would think that I was closely monitoring Jeonil.\u201cI hired them not just because of their abilities, but from the uniqueness of this country.\u201dI had made a good choice hiring Jamie, her head worked as smoothly as her beauty was striking. She found the answer to what Jeonil needed by herself. Finding a real estate investment counsel was the next step, and she first found a safe way to manage the unidentifiable hot money that had poured into Jeonil.As my hiring Jamie had produced good results, the two men were the same for Jamie.\u201cYou know that it was not for work that I hired them as directors.\u201dI remained still so she could continue speaking.\u201cDo you know what the two are doing? They are dabbling in politics. I gave them positions to at least look legitimate on the surface, but they\u2019re involved politics when they\u2019re not even politicians.\u201d\\nShe then said they had been meeting senior politicians. I was going to say something, but Jamie spoke first.\u201cHowever, in this country, that was the way things are done. I\u2019m learning a lot from them and managed to put Daehoo on the list because of those two men.\u201d\u201cJamie, let\u2019s remember one thing.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cCorruption exists everywhere. America legalized lobbying and made it public, but the fundamental rules are the same. I don\u2019t know whether you can adjust to this country with that sort of bias.\u201dThe heated atmosphere cooled down, and Jamie\u2019s face grew notably cold.\u201cHowever, this country is indeed unique in its conglomerates.\u201dI finished up.\u201cI apologize. Please go on. My clients will see Daehoo being on the list as a favorable step. The problem is the buyout money.\u201dJamie scratched her brow to compose herself and opened her lips. The summary was that Daehoo would become the sacrifice to the IMF. The current President and his Cabinet needed something that could cover the criticism they would face, and Daehoo was the best option.As Jamie had said, Daehwan Cho and Chungsik Park were doing everything from creating the scenario to writing the script by gathering the politicians.Even if the government needed a scapegoat, could they really sacrifice Daehoo? Korean conglomerates like Daehoo had special power structures and it\u2019s loss would massively affect Korea.Around this time, there were a lot of prominent politicians who had been bought by Daehyeon, Daehoo, and Ilsung\u2026 I remembered then the arrest warrant for Daehoo\u2019s president had already been issued, and the process should have been extremely difficult, without some way to pressure the President or the Diet, or both\u2026There must have been secrets that Daehwan Cho and Chungsik Park could not report to Jamie, and I mentally held a thumbs-up to them. Those two middle-aged men knew their stuff. How did they think of hitting Daehoo now?\\n***As I had mentioned before, the upper-class financial and political elites had a high survival rate in the Trial Tests. They instinctively preyed on the weak for their own profit, hamstrung and ambushed those stronger than them, used fear to survive, and engaged in hostile takeovers and pressured buyouts even in what looked like peaceful times on the surface.This life of survival and skill was what they knew and understood, and Daehwan Cho and Chungsik Park were true elites, using Jeonil to gain secret favors, and ruin enemies.\u201cThe evidence the current government has on Daehoo has will be revealed in court.\u201d\u201cBlood will flow at the end of the trial.\u201dThe current government knew that this would be a rougher month than when they passed the real-time online financial system, but they did so anyway because there would be a larger reward.\u201cWhat are they requesting?\u201d \u201cTwo things.\u201d\u201cAdditional investments and a block buyout.\u201d\u201cYes, an additional investment of at least 5 billion dollars and the entire Daehoo Group, including their debts.\u201dAdditional investments were not a problem, and while the funding routes would be uncertain due to haste, the current government will help us hide the transfers.However, Jamie was observing my mood because buying the entire Daehoo Group would not result in as much profit as the subsidiaries and affiliates varied in their profitability and solvency.When thinking of money in the short-term, it would be better to wait until Daehoo was completely split up and gobble the core subsidiaries and affiliates, and Jamie seemed to be thinking the same thing.\u201cDaehoo will be cleaned up even if we left them alone. However, it\u2019s too much of a shame to let it go.\u201d\\nI motioned Jamie to come over the window, and she followed me.\u201cDo you know what the Korean government is saying nowadays?\u201dJamie\u2019s gaze followed my finger and to the streets, where people were still coming in with gold rings. The Gold Collection Campaign banner was still flying in the wind.\u201cShare the pain. Is that necklace gold?\u201dJamie stroked the necklace.\u201cIn Gwanghwamoon it will be noticed. Don\u2019t wear it openly, but discreetly. Make up a story like that being your mother\u2019s keepsake and bring the two directors with you.\u201dSince Jamie was smart, she knew what I was talking about. (EN: I think Sun is saying it would look bad for the government to let the struggling subsidiaries and affiliates go bankrupt and leave their staff unemployed. Sun is making an offer to the government they can\u2019t refuse. ^_^ )\u201cI know that I need justification.\u201d\u201cAnd Jamie.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cAggressively proceed without worrying about the additional investments or management direction. While there are opportunities everywhere, grab everything you can find. Jeonil Investments needs to monopolize this country\u2019s crisis. I gave you that much money. Don\u2019t lose whatever it may be, lands, buildings, or companies.\u201dEdited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The biggest reason the IMF crisis happened was due to domestic firms recklessly borrowing dollars to hide their insolvency from their own shareholders, the influence of the Japanese Yen, and the attack of international investors, but those reasons will be hidden. (EN: the state of being insolvent; inability to pay one\u2019s debts.)I turned off the screen after watching the news regarding the Daehoo Group President\u2019s first trial. Jonathan was as hard to reach as Jamie, and I sent the times I could be contacted by email and asked that he should reach out to me as soon as possible.He contacted me the next day, and I requested one thing from him \u2013 that he should come to Korea.***Jonathan\u2019s First Korean Visit. The God of Investments arrives in the \u201cHermit Kingdom\u201d.[Jonathan \u201cKorea still maintains its investment value in the long term, and I have visited to confirm this.\u201d]\u2018Jonathan,\u2019 from Jonathan Investments, visited Seoul yesterday on the 23rd. While the name was unfamiliar to us, Wall Street actually called him the \u201cGod of Investments.\u201d He had unveiled his genius in investing during the Asian financial crisis from last year and had risen to super stardom as a global investor. It had not taken Jonathan half a year to turn four hundred thousand dollars to twenty-two billion dollars.\u2013 Jonathan \u2013 an investor or a Hollywood actor? Will he be treated as a state guest\u2026Those who arrived to greet Jonathan, including the Senior Secretary of Economics Cheolmin Kim, and the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Il Yuk, were worried about the weather over Gimpo Airport. The news announcing snow made it questionable whether Jonathan\u2019s private plane could land or not.However, Jonathan exited his plane waving his hand, dressed in a black suit. About a hundred reporters gathered around Gimpo Airport for Jonathan, and the large banners that announced Jonathan\u2019s first visit to Korea hanging in the middle of the airport were signs of Jonathan\u2019s fame.After a brief conference, Jonathan headed to the Blue House with a police escort.\u2013 Jonathan\u2019s Theory of Investment. \u201cInvest without Fear.\u201dWhen answering a question lightly asked by a reporter regarding how one should invest in order to hit the jackpot during the conference, Jonathan spoke of his theory of investing without fear. As Jonathan had broken records and achieved astronomical profit rates, his investment theory reassured domestic and foreign investors and Korean citizens, who stood frozen in the overwhelming fear the IMF crisis had brought. This was because Jonathan spoke of his goal in coming to Korea \u201csince Korea has the power to overcome this financial crisis, this is one of the best investments one could make in the long run\u201d and revealed his vision of Korea.***I went to the pub I had rented for private use, and the key was hidden in the flowerpot as agreed. As I entered the pub, the heater had been turned on as I requested.With a sign saying that the pub will be closed for the day hung on the entrance, since it was broad daylight, the pub remained silent for a long time. The silence broke after a careful knock, and I saw a tall shadow from the window.Jonathan was alone, and he confirmed he wasn\u2019t followed before greeting me. He locked the door first without my asking.\u201cYou\u2019re alone?\u201dJonathan asked, and I nodded.\\n\u201cI feel like I have become an industrial spy.\u201dHe spoke as he placed a briefcase on the table.\u201cFame is not always a good thing.\u201d\u201cYeah, I barely managed to get out.\u201dWhile he had prepared to come to Korea, the visit proved to be even more hectic than our expectations. He told me he had not imagined that he would be treated as a state guest on arrival. Forbes had named him one of the twenty richest men globally. In stark contrast, the other entries on the list were international financial institutions that had made history for centuries or possessed strategic branches all over the world. The New York firm Jonathan acted as CEO was a small-sized investment company.He only needed a small office, and Jonathan was only in his twenties. However, Korea had treated him like a world leader because he had astounding piles of cash.\u201cKorea is that desperate now.\u201d\u201cHowever, hope is growing.The IMF is providing support funds, and you\u2019re feeding in dollars.\u201dIt was appropriate for a foreigner like Jonathan to evaluate the situation like that, but Korean financiers would find this assessment absolutely humiliating. It was comparable to the Japanese colonial era since Korea had to bow down to whatever command the IMF would give out and stand helplessly as property was confiscated overseas.However, I had not called Jonathan to discuss such matters.\u201cKorea will overcome the IMF quickly.\u201dMore so than Korea had in the past.\u201cI also hope that, since I\u2019ve become too familiar with this country. However, Sun, wasn\u2019t that due to your efforts?\u201d\u201cDaehoo?\u201d\u201cYes, I could not believe what I heard. Has Korea decided to throw Daehoo under the bus?\u201dWhile Jonathan had not lived in Korea for more than a few months, he was a Wall Street financier, and Daehoo had been closely connected with many foreign firms.The connections were showing up in the stock price changes of those firms.\u201cDaehoo was not part of our plan, and I had not expected that the current Korean government would throw away Daehoo.\u201d\u201cEven you? Then who did this?\u201d\\n\u201cWhile this is not my plan, it\u2019s proceeding under our supervision.\u201d\u201cOh, Jeonil Investments?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re working on their own and doing well. I\u2019m quite proud.\u201dJonathan smiled, but it was without much amusement.\u201cYou have the funds to buy them?\u201d\u201cThere are many firms in this country that can be bought with one dollar.\u201dIf only one could bear their debts.\u201cEveryone will come rushing in at that time, smelling the blood in the water. Have you finished talking with your government?\u201dJonathan now sat on a chair.\u201cNegotiations are underway, but the results will not change. Other firms cannot accommodate the government\u2019s demands as well as Jeonil, since those companies will not accept a bloc buyout for the entire Daehoo infrastructure.\u201d\u201cAre you going to buy the entire group?\u201d\u201cYes. However, we will restructure and take care of some subsidiaries immediately afterwards.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t you going about this backward? I\u2019m not following you.\u201d\u201cYou have understood the situation. We will not dismantle the group, and the management will not change as we will use those who are close to the current president.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why go that far?\u201d\u201cForeign Dollars will not be the definitive power forever. When Korea graduates from the IMF, the economy will quickly spring back to normal. We have to prepare for the next step.\u201dJonathan\u2019s eyes were smiling now.\u201cSun, you actually seem to like your country a lot. Even if you say you don\u2019t, that\u2019s not an embarrassing trait. I don\u2019t know what you see in Daewoo, but I know that there\u2019s not that much money going on in there. Using that money elsewhere will bring in more profit, as your country\u2019s economy is in freefall right now.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ll see about the money.\u201d\\nHowever, Jonathan and the unidentified John Doe had made the profit with a mere four hundred thousand dollars. Since John Doe\u2019s identity was a secret, it was only natural that Jonathan would be the sole subject of fame and attention.The forty-three billion dollars had been jumped in and out of tax havens like hackers would bounce off of routers to hide their identities. The total amount that had been moved would have been much greater.It was inevitable that rumors would begin to spread in the global financial market. The rumors that said it was money from the Soviet Union during the Civil War was going too far, but the rumors that it was the secret stash from the financiers who won the Asian financial crisis was more believable. Such rumors would be spreading now.On the other hand, Jonathan did not know much outside of the funds in the New York firm. He was calm after hearing my explanation like he was satisfied with his current situation.\u201cWhat you\u2019re telling me is too surreal.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how much is where if I don\u2019t see the ledgers.\u201d\u201cIf you lose them?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re forever gone with them.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s food for thought.\u201dJonathan covered his body with both of his arms.\u201cTherefore, we have to clean them whenever there\u2019s a chance.\u201d\u201cYou called me for that? I told you I do not care about money outside the New York firm. That\u2019s more than enough for me. Come to think of that\u2026\u201d\u201cI have called you to solve some of your problems. Aren\u2019t those portfolios in that briefcase?\u201dI pointed my chin at the briefcase Jonathan had brought with him.\u201cStart the briefing.\u201dJonathan seemed to have been waiting for me to press the start button, as I heard the briefcase land on the table as soon as I finished speaking.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 33: Past Life Returner Chapter 33 \\nChapter 33\\nIn 2017, Google\u2019s interview question had been similar to the following problem.The Thousand-Dollar GameYou are alone with a stranger in a room.You are ordered to divide a thousand dollars between you and the stranger.You can freely decide on the amount, but the stranger knows that the total amount is a thousand dollars.You cannot directly communicate with the stranger.*If the stranger agrees with the amount you presented, the negotiation is deemed a success, and both of you keep the money.*If the stranger refuses the amount you presented, the negotiation is deemed a failure, and the entire amount is confiscated.*How much money will you propose in this scenario?Each person interviewed was presented with various proposals from 70:30, 50:50, 51:49, 30:70, 1:99. The interviewer asked for the thinking process they would use to choose a proposal instead of asking for a definitive answer. The question itself was from behavioral economics, and it was really a question about human greed.However, what if the question was about ten billion dollars instead? Even if the ratio changed by only one percent, that single percent meant one hundred million dollars.***The saying that human greed was endless seemed to be wrong in the face of billions of dollars. Jonathan seemed to have been playing that imaginary game all this time with the sixty-five billion dollars we had earned. He didn\u2019t care about our agreed on shares, and Jonathan had decided his share was ten billion.He was passionately explaining about the portfolio of ten billion to me. Since the amount was so large, Jonathan emphasized safety instead of aggressive investments. Therefore, he presented the idea of directly investing in the firms already included in the Global DOW. (EN: The Global Dow is a 150-stock index of corporations from around the world, created by Dow Jones &amp; Company. Only blue-chip stocks are included in the index.)In other words, Jonathan was thinking of investing in the thirty best firms in America, all of them known globally.The idea was not bad since the DOW was the yardstick for performance. It had recorded an average of a five percent profit, and the current eight thousand points of profitability will come to exceed twenty thousand until the Day of Advent.Even if we just let the investments sit, the profit will be larger than interest rates. The problem was that it was not especially good, either. If the twentieth century was led by manufacturing and energy firms, the twenty-first century would be led by the Information Technology firms.However, the number of IT firms Jonathan had listed in his thirty was only five in total.I spoke after waiting for him to finish.\u201cIsn\u2019t it too early to divide our shares? I\u2019ll give you time for that later. However, not now.\u201d\u201cSun, it\u2019s sixty-five billion dollars. The money will continue to increase whatever we do with it.\u201d\u201cTell that to the Roc\u2026\u201d\\nI realized that I had spoken too much since I had mentioned a family name that was historically significant\u2026no, a name that had MADE history. While I stopped myself from talking, Jonathan seemed to have heard the name in that brief moment. I looked at him with concern, and he was mumbling something with round eyes.\u201cWhat did you say?\u201dFor financiers, that family name was a divine word. Jonathan looked at me with shock. While the name still existed in this era under trusts, managed by global banks, the name was something that belonged in legends. How much were they estimated at, five trillion dollars? The power they showed in their prime was evident, as they had built a country and changed the direction of a World War.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dJonathan seemed speechless for a minute, but then he started to nod. On the other hand, I was keeping my mouth shut. Why had I chosen to return to the day I was born instead of on the day of the Trial Tests? Because of the Man Who Overcame Adversity trait? The stats I would develop? If I only considered the Eight Virtues and the Eight Evils, the day of the Trial Tests would have been the right choice since there were many opportunities to rebuild myself in that time.I had come back in time so far because of what had happened before the Eight Virtues and Eight Evils appeared.***Humanity had time to rebuild, and there had been many opportunities to preserve our civilization and face the monsters. If we had taken those opportunities, human civilization would not have crumbled, and we would have been able to survive under the System. That meant that the internet and the electronic devices that had originally been for everyone\u2019s use would not have become privileges for the Awakened.However, humanity had frozen in fear in front of supernatural beings and events. They had made mistakes and made things worse, which led to ruin. Then, the Eight Virtues and Eight Evils appeared to tip us over the precipice.\u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019m still hungry.\u201d\u201c\u2026That\u2019s a nice expression.\u201dCome to think of it, I had four years to wait until one of the more joyful times in my life. The 2002 World Cup had been a festival for Koreans, and there had been a jubilant passion that could not have been bought with all of my money in the Gwanghwamun streets. However, I would not be able to enjoy myself that much since I already knew the results. (EN: South Korea co-hosted the 2002 FIFA World Cup tournament with Japan. They had never won a game in the World Cup previously but the South Korean team achieved their first ever victory in a World Cup with a 2\u20130 victory against Poland when the tournament began. I wonder how much Sun is planning to bet with the bookmakers\u2026 ^_^ )I spoke to Jonathan clearly after coming back to reality.\u201cDon\u2019t speak of retirement again. Did you hear me?\u201dJonathan\u2019s face fell for a moment since he had not directly spoken of retirement. However, his investment directions clearly spoke of his thoughts, as portfolios acted as windows to the mind for financiers.Jonathan looked down at his portfolio and became silent. He then began to nod quietly.\u201cHold on to that and use it for customers.\u201d \u201cCustomers?\u201d\\n\u201cWhat became of the small company mergers?\u201dJonathan began to smile, and he had definitely put it on hold. I could not blame him since he had been so busy lately. As Jamie was tormented by Korean politicians and financiers, everyone would be on Jonathan by now. I had seen his face at least ten times through various media.\u201cRefuse all interviews and events. Since you can\u2019t focus on work, you\u2019re getting overloaded, and you\u2019re overthinking things.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re asking me to decrease my load once I get back. I can do that, but\u2026\u201d\u201cEveryone is looking at you now, and once you open, customers will come in flocks.\u201d\u201cWhat about the clientele? Managing a property management company is not easy.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, and we have to choose carefully the investment firm we will buy.\u201d\u201cThe focus should be on the quality of the managers instead of their funds. The firm will be filled with investors better than me. That was quite stressful and was not at all enjoyable.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Jeffrey Kay, right?\u201dHe was the firm hunter we hired for the New York firm a while ago.\u201cYes, I\u2019m avoiding him as much as possible. I don\u2019t even open my mouth when I see him, in case he may guess everything.\u201dJonathan smiled in self-mockery.\u201c\u2026Jonathan, you would have succeeded without meeting me.\u201d\u201cAs much as now?\u201dJonathan firmly shook his head when I had been about to say something. He was telling me not to console him in any way. Jonathan regarded himself as not having contributed much to our success, and it was true.The trading Jonathan helped me with was the basic procedure for any Wall Street financiers who had graduated from \u201cjunior\u201d.However, I decided I would not think what Jonathan was feeling now any longer, as he would realize by himself when expanding the investment firm. He would know that a hungry beast was within him\u2026That kind of primal instinct did not come with only the loss of loved ones, as human beings find a new side of themselves when they reach their limits.\\n\u201cThat you would have succeeded without me.\u201d\u201cOh, that.\u201dJonathan was indifferent, but it was the truth.\u201cIf you feel stressed, show your abilities this time. It\u2019s not about investments, though.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cThe management of the Bluestone Group is in Korea now.\u201dKorea was the battlefield between corporate hunters at present, and Bluestone had a corporate hunting team. While their business cards said that they belonged to the \u2018Special Reclamation Fund Management Team,\u2019 what they did was to buy firms and real estate and sell them in pieces. They increased their customer\u2019s returns through such tactics.\u201cWin over the corporate hunter team and add them to the New York firm.\u201d\u201cYou were serious?\u201d\u201cOf course. Shake things from the ground. Without them, Bluestone\u2019s new fund product is useless, and we will start from there.\u201dI wanted Blue Rock the most out of their property management firms. While the Bluestone Group itself was famous as a global investment firm, Blue Rock was the true treasure. Blue Rock was a dragon lying in wait and would start to rise from 1995 after becoming an independent firm.After two decades, along with Kim Cheongsoo, Jillian, and Jessica, they would become the greatest Global Investment Firm. Blue Rock managed about four trillion dollars at the time, and counting the funds that followed the investments, the amount they influenced would jump to the quintillions.However, the Blue Rock I wanted was in the future and not in the present. They were being pressured by the Bluestone Group and had barely scratched the top twenty in the field. Their heyday would only be in my memories anyway. (EN: Sun is buying out his future competition.

It was a Korean construction firm that made a good profit, but the real estate in their possession was the real treasure.They had bought land that was certain to be redeveloped, and the site would be a priority for Korea when the country overcame the IMF crisis.\u201cI told you to work on item 3 in secret many times.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault. I believe our chairman needs to meet the powerhouses of Korea.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not the problem. We\u2019re losing all the assets in the bay we were trying to get in secret, and we\u2019ll end up with nothing!\u201dKaufman began to wish for alcohol since the situation suffocated him. He had heard the name Jeonil Investments for the first time when he came to Korea. He had never heard of them before, and he found through research that Jeonil Investments had successfully lobbied to quickly open the real estate market.He would have just applauded if things ended like that, because when everyone was focused on Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong, Jeonil Investments showed its expertise as an investment firm by entering Korea faster than anyone else and building connections with the government.However, they were greedier than Kaufman\u2019s expectations, and they bought anything that came up on their radar with twice the money. They simply could not compete with funding that Jeonil possessed. As Jeonil had opened the real estate market to foreign investors, they obviously had deep ties with the current regime.Therefore, Kaufman suspected that Jeonil Investments\u2019 funds came from the Dictator\u2019s slush funds, the man who had ruled over Korea during the sixties and seventies. That answered some of the questions.\u201cThe Chairman has to come. Don\u2019t you think this mess needs to be straightened out?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s worse than you think. He has to come to say things that the Korean government wants to hear and request that Jeonil Investments be muzzled and get people in power to oppose Jeonil. They\u2019re trying to buy up this country\u2019s market with a bigger wallet, and we have to attack this point.\u201dKaufman thought things over, and his team member\u2019s request was logical. The real estate that came out in the market was for the private sector, but Jeonil had changed the rules. What was the name of that Korean CEO of Jeonil? The family name was Park, which was also the dictator\u2019s family name.The CEO had somehow managed to have the Korean government change the pre-declaration system for high price real estate to enable Jeonil to place the first bid on all assets that came up for sale. It was an alliance between the government and business, and Kaufman was annoyed because he regretted not entering the market first. Jeonil Investments\u2019 position should have been Bluestone\u2019s and his.\\n\u201cJonathan Hunter has come. Why can\u2019t the Chairman?\u201dKaufman heard the name of that lucky [email protected] While his gaze was still on the list, he could not read the letters anymore, thinking about the unfairness of life.\u201cWe will lose Daehoo in this case. Haven\u2019t you checked my report?\u201d\u201cCalm down first, and let\u2019s think things over. What are our priorities in this situation?\u201dKaufman asked the entire team, and the answers were the same. The team wanted the group\u2019s Chairman to visit Korea quickly and voice his opinions along with other investment firms in this country, and they had to hire the power brokers who had connections to those in power. The meeting became more heated, and at the end, someone said that they had to denounce the relationship between the current government and Jeonil and publicly ask that the origin of the firm\u2019s dollars should be revealed.That was going too far, as it was taboo to touch the hot money that would soon belong to the rich in this country. Jeonil Investments would not be the only one hurt by that. The reason that they, who were the elite of the elite in Wall Street, were being pushed to the extreme was that they could not gobble up the prey they saw everywhere. Kaufman slowly nodded at the desperate team members\u2019 faces.\u201cThere are a lot of you who want to be a journalist. Let\u2019s go make some noise.\u201dKaufman spoke, and the team members agreed. Except one.\u201cThis is not about our team.\u201d\u201cSpeak.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something else we could do with approval from above.\u201d\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cAn alliance between Bluestone Group and Jonathan Investments. Jonathan Investments has the best cash flow, and that\u2019s what this country wants the most.\u201d\u201cJonathan had come to Korea yesterday. Would he meet us? I\u2019m pessimistic.\u201d\u201cJonathan also understands the situation, and he would also go empty-handed at this rate. He would not like that.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026we don\u2019t need to bring the President in, as Jonathan could be our front man to the Korean government.\u201d\\n\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go with that.\u201dKaufman and his team members began to work hard again, as they were determined not to go back empty-handed from a country where they could make the best profit of their lives.It was then a message came to their room from the hotel lobby.***I heard from Choi of Ilju Constructions that operations were going smoothly. While the construction was proceeding in the middle of winter, the fact that there was no snowfall helped.The sharp tax audit on Daehoo had finished, and now the entire Daehoo workforce staged a walkout. Because the government was heavy handed with the financial authorities and the creditors, the walkout started a year earlier than the previous history.There were no fancy events like before that celebrated Daehoo\u2019s CEO\u2019s retirement. Those outside of the president\u2019s family maintained their positions and would not be thrown out. The phone rang at an inappropriate moment.(EN: Folding screen, or distraction)The bell that signaled class started rang, and the cell phone I brought around was small enough to fit my inside pocket. Cell phone size continued to decrease, and after the PDA era started last October, it became easy to carry. (EN: Personal Digital Assistant)After I came out of the bathroom stall, there were guys who were staring at me. I did not know who they were, but they knew me.\\nI was someone people would look at twice since I looked like an adult and did not play with other classmates. However, even taking those into consideration, it would not be too excessive to say that she was too interested in me.My homeroom teacher seemed like she wanted to say something and was just chattering to build up to that subject.\u201cDo you have something you want to say?\u201d\u201cDo you have to go to a cram school? Where do you go?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSorry, I\u2019m holding you up, aren\u2019t I.\u201d\u201cI just don\u2019t understand this conversation. If it\u2019s not important, may I go?\u201d\u201cWait a moment, Sunhoo.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWhat I want to say is that\u2026school is a good place.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI know that it\u2019s hard to adjust to you. But your classmates do not hate you but are afraid of you.\u201dWhat did she want to say?\u201cSo, if you open up and come to them, you can make friends and know that school\u2019s a good place. Let\u2019s work on that during the next semester. Can you make a promise?\u201dShe was saying things that I only saw on TV shows, and it was a talent to be able to say those words with a smile. She seemed to be only a new teacher, and I may have misunderstood her passion.\u201cIt\u2019s a promise!\u201dShe shouted again behind my back as I went out, and she still had that bright smile.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A chaebol often consists of many diversified affiliates, controlled by an owner whose power over the group often exceeds legal authority.)No matter how much the Democrat president-elect worried, the times would prove him correct. Not only Daehoo but also Daehyun and Ilsung had almost gone bankrupt more than once during the IMF crisis. The Chaebols smaller than them were already busy cutting out unnecessary fat within their infrastructure.I read the Korean daily newspapers and global ones once I came to my office each day along with Forbes and other private newsletters.As I mentioned before, my interventions led to some changes from the previous history.The global investment groups lost large amounts of money in the Asian financial crisis, and most of it entered my pockets.Korean financial and real estate markets opened to foreign countries half a year early.Jonathan became a noted name in the financial world.The incident that occurred late last year filled my thoughts the most out of the changes. I had shaken the global stock market by pouring oil in the Hong Kong crisis and amplified the incident that had been called the second Black Monday in both timelines.Until now, my interventions had not shown much on the surface, but I did not know what may be lying in wait for me. If I did not constantly check the global trends, it was possible that I may lose money. That was investing for you.However, why had my homeroom teacher been changed to that woman? Why? I kept thinking of her face.***Even if my public status as minor was low, I could follow or investigate an individual. My homeroom teacher\u2019s name was Yeonhee Woo, and she was twenty-four years old, born in Seoul, and was the oldest sister out of two brothers and two sisters. She lived in a studio located in the third story of a building near the school, and she did not have a roommate or a boyfriend. While her family was middle-class financially, her finances were neglected.Yeonhee Woo liked sweets and did not care much about clothes or makeup despite her beauty. She did not socialize much, and I learned this much information by going through her room in her absence.\\nIt was more like a man\u2019s domicile than a woman\u2019s in my eyes, as she did not have a mirror or a dressing table. Her few cosmetics stood on her computer table with a picture she had taken with her father this year. She did not have any unpaid bills, cleaned her room, and I did not see any condoms or pregnancy tests in the trash bin.She did not list any phone numbers of her friends in the notebook next to her phone and did not pay much attention to her underwear, as she bought them in bundle packs from supermarkets.I wanted to see her photo albums and found them on the top of her dresser. The pictures had not been placed in the album but stuck between them as if she just used the photo album book to simply store loose photos. They were not of her memories, as the pictures were of other people.What interested me was the setting of the pictures, as it seemed that every picture was taken in secret. Therefore, the subjects were blocked by obstacles, or the focus was not right. According to the dates on the picture, she had been taking these pictures for years.There were a number of pictures, and she seemed to have recorded some people each year. At the least, she did not seem to be a pervert, as she had taken pictures of faces instead of other body parts, whether the subject was male or female. It seemed that she had wanted to take pictures of their expressions, but that was strange in itself. What she did was disturbing, and was this why she was showering me with attention these days? Am I the subject of her obsession?I placed the photos back and started to look for my pictures that would be stored somewhere. They were gathered in an envelope of photos from a photo service in her camera bag.During the time which I had skipped as the tutorial, she had taken pictures at the elementary school graduation ceremony that I had previously only confirmed through my mother\u2019s pictures. No matter how my senses had dulled in peace, I would have noticed someone\u2019s gaze.In early 1997, I had the stats of a professional athlete and had grown as such. I had been looking at her camera in the picture, and I did not know what had happened afterward.I would have probably considered her trivial, as there was a crowd in the graduation ceremony, and would have thought her camera had pointed in my direction by coincidence.However, the camera had taken my picture quite accurately, and she had discovered me then. There were no more pictures after the graduation ceremony, as she seemed to have discovered that I was sensitive to gazes. She had changed tactics by listing my characteristics in her notes, which was also in the camera bag.\\nSometimes, the most innocuous person could be more than what meets the eye, and she was such a person. Who would have known that she was such a person? She did not even use her beauty as a weapon. It would have been more effective to pretend a coincidental meeting than using a camera in secret, no matter who the person was.I felt somewhat sorry for my homeroom teacher, as people like her did not end well. While her beauty made her seem one of the normal people, when her mental disorder grew worse and her beauty diminished with age, she would be discovered by others.For example\u2026I turned my attention to her family picture, of which there was only one.There were no other family members in the picture, and only her father stood awkwardly next to Yeonhee Woo. Her face was impassive, unlike the smiles she showed in school.However, the fact she had placed the picture on the computer desk where she would be able to see it already spoke of her lonely future.I decided to end my investigation there, as I had reached the conclusion. I thought it would be best to remain quiet until her attention shifted to someone else.Then I found an old prescription bottle.[Pyeonghwa Mental Health Clinic]Of course, SSRI medicine could be prescribed for various uses, like for depression or anxiety. However, the medicine was also used for schizophrenia and megalomania. (EN: SSRI stands for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitor. SSRI antidepressants are a type of antidepressant that work by increasing levels of serotonin within the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that is often referred to as the \u201cfeel good hormone\u201d.)\u201cWait..\u201d\\n* While she says she does not play video games, since they are becoming popular, she may have accessed them.* Her biggest hallucination is that she argues that she can feel the emotions of other people.][Prescription: First, placebos for integration disorder. No effects. Second, drugs for integration disorder. No effects. Third, drugs and individual sessions. No effects. Fourth, drugs and family sessions. No effects. Fifth, SSRI intramuscular injection. Little effect. Sixth, SSRI intramuscular injection. Some effects. Seventh, SSRI intramuscular injection. Much effect. Eighth, placebos for integration disorder. Much effect.]Integration disorder was another name for schizophrenia in this era, and placebos were fake medicine used in such treatments. Her prescription record had not been changed from her eighth treatment. She had been given fake medicine and stopped a few years ago.She had not been smart in going to the hospital and telling her family. I saw what she had gone through and the pain she must have felt. I could see that she had been given shots from her prescription records and had lied to her family when she had been nearly hospitalized.However, they would have not been effective, as what she was seeing was real.\u201cSo, I meet a pre-Awakened person like this\u2026\u201dYeonhee Woo had the traits of an empathic healer, which was one of the rarest. However, not all of the pre-Awakened were powerful, and many died or became crushed under the burden before they could build on their abilities.I probably had not heard of Yeonhee Woo due to that, as she would have either committed suicide or died in a dungeon.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36: Past Life Returner Chapter 36 \\nChapter 36\\nThe reason there were so few empathic healers was not only because of the rareness of the ability, but because it was difficult for them to even survive.The Eight Evils and Eight Virtues and other guilds all forcefully \u201crecruited\u201d empathic healers as soon as they were found.The problem rose from there. New empathic healers were traumatised due to the Trial Tests and had to care for other new Awakened and those already Awakened. While the number of empathic healers were small, the number they had to treat was many.The empathic link was considered an extremely dangerous phenomenon in psychology or psychiatry, as the empathic healer may be overpowered by the patient\u2019s emotions and thus, unable to disengage from the patient\u2019s mind. What is more, empathic healers directly touched their patient\u2019s emotions and memories by their abilities, and those they had to treat were those already Awakened, who were hardened killers, and those newly Awakened, who were fresh born killers.Their mental state was seriously unstable due to the Trial Tests, and most Awakened were thrown back to the world without a period of rest, freshly traumatized by the horrors of the Trial Tests.It may have been inevitable that the minds of the Awakened were nightmarish hellscapes, filled with rage, anguish, hatred, regret, despair and suicidal tendencies. Empathic healers had to share such minds, which was unendurable. Therefore, after awakening, they tended to die out as empathic healers could not heal each other, as the mental damage they suffered was amplified when being shared with each other.Yeonhee Woo, a pre-Awakened, would have to face the horrible torture that empathic healers had to face if she survived until the Day of Advent.As I did not know her name, her life probably did not end well.***I met Yeonhee Woo again during homeroom the next morning. Usually, there was a shadow in her smile, but today was different. This change had come after our conversation, and other students also saw that change during the ethics class, which she taught. She seemed to be feeling that my session with her was effective.I could not be certain since I had no idea how her ability worked, but she had no other reason to be that happy. She did not have a lover, friends, or good relations with her family, and her pay had not been raised.It was the end of the school day, and students did not listen; however, she tried to quiet them down. Yeonhee Woo maintained her smile and tone.\u201cI will not tell you your next year\u2019s class assignments unless you guys settle down.\u201dYeonhee Yoo shook the paper she held in her hand, and my classmates showed various emotions as the class assignments were revealed from the first classroom to the tenth. Then, when my name was called, the room went eerily silent. Those in the same class with me were not happy, and while I did not know their names, I could see it in their faces.Students did not fight in this class because of me, and those who strayed early on learned to spend their time in other classrooms during breaks away from my presence. And they were now in the same class as me. While normally middle school classes were designated so that the students in each class were at the same point in the curriculum, this arrangement had a different agenda.Since other classes had their share of troublemakers, the school had decided to put the problematic students into a single class and put me in it, whom they could not fight against or talk back to\u2026Therefore, the class atmosphere brightened, as other students no longer had to worry anymore about the students who would be in the same class as me. Even in middle school, children learned survival instincts. Children may pretend otherwise, but they feared the strong and herded together for mutual protection.\\nIn Trial Tests, it was between the Awakened, and after the test, it was between the civilians and the Awakened. Nothing really changed.Those who were in the same class as me were busy avoiding my gaze, and spending time with such babies made me tired.I thought middle school was my limit and wondered what good way would be to not to go to high school without disappointing my parents. (EN: Middle schools in South Korea consist of three grades. Most students enter at age 12 or 13 and graduate at age 15 or 16.)\u201cI\u2019m happy that you guys are happy.\u201dI met Yeonhee Woo\u2019s eyes, and she spoke in my direction.\u201cStay safe during the vacation, and I\u2019ll see you again.\u201d\u201cTeacher, aren\u2019t you in charge of the first grade?\u201d\u201cI also became in charge of the second grade.\u201dYeonhee Woo lightly answered the question, as boys would like anyone in a skirt. Moreover, Yeonhee Woo would look pretty in their eyes, like a small puppy. While she was cute, not beautiful, boys would not care. Yeonhee Woo took me to the staff room again afterward, and this was the reason there were strange rumors regarding the two of us. Because of those rumors, boys being boys, Yeonhee Woo became the object of sexual fantasies among them. I tried to mention that as I followed her.\u201cIf you take me to your office whenever they are watching\u2026\u201dYeonhee Woo spoke before I could finish my sentence.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I would not have to call you if your school life did not need my attention.\u201dShe changed the subject.\u201cAre you interested in basketball?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d \u201cHowever, I do need to tell you something. Seongil Middle School wants to see you during vacation. Do you know that there is a basketball team there?\u201d\u201cI thought I told you before that I\u2019m not interested in sports.\u201d \\n \u201cYou\u2019re not?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a lie. You do chin-ups every lunchtime.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not interested in competitive sports like basketball.\u201d\u201cAll of them?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou know that your physical abilities are amazing, and you\u2019re even still growing. I want to meet your parents, and would that be all right?\u201d\u201cMy father and my mother are working.\u201dI saw that she found my words a relief in her face. If she showed her emotions like that, anyone could read her. Yeonhee Woo seemed to have been interested in my family affairs. Not about my interest in sports.Since layoffs were everywhere during these times, it seemed that she wanted to confirm that my father was working. Yeonhee Woo brightened after that, and she stopped as I did. She then gazed at the CD that I took out of my bag.\u201cYou play video games, too?\u201dShe seemed surprised.\u201cTeacher, you don\u2019t?\u201d\u201cNot even once.\u201dI did not know what she saw in me that worried her, but she followed me to this school because she was worried about me.\u201cThen, try this when you\u2019re bored. I heard that teachers rest during vacations.\u201dI ignored her polite refusal, and almost forced the RPG game CD on Yeonhee Woo.\\nI immediately thought of one name at Jonathan\u2019s mention of Pittsburgh, and it was ANC Financial! My eyes opened because Jonathan had thought that far.Jonathan\u2019s voice was brighter than Yeonhee Woo\u2019s today, and he had to be seeing the same thing as I. What would happen after we bring in the client funds from Blue Rock and ANC? Jonathan seemed as excited as when we bet everything in Thailand and Hong Kong.I could not stop him when he was stepping onto a bigger battlefield, as he had to regain his former self as quickly as possible.Edited by Userunfriendly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had a stack of documents filled with facts and figures, and Jonathan kept consulting them despite being the one who had prepared them.\u201cHere it is. I think we can negotiate with ANC on this point. They are badly managing twenty billion dollars worth of deposits, and adding Blue Rock\u2019s thirty billion worth of deposits will make it fifty billion.\u201dJonathan was not talking about ANC and Blue Rock\u2019s money, they were client funds deposits that their customers had entrusted with them with the expectation of a profitable return. What was of note was that some of the client funds that ANC had gathered were from the USA government\u2019s pension fund. I looked over the evidence, and of course we both knew that even tens of billions of dollars was petty compared to the entire USA pension fund. However, the fact that the money was there meant something, and I felt like I had unexpectedly received a box. It may be a bronze but may unexpectedly turn into a challenger box.Jonathan smiled as he looked at the document I was holding.\u201cI thought you would notice that.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s the rest?\u201dJonathan took out some more documents from his inside pocket, and I needed to confirm the specifics out of the several hundred kinds of pensions the USA government managed.\u201cWhat is this?\u201dMy voice was tense, and Jonathan\u2019s eyes widened in surprise as if this had been a test for me. Looks like I passed, I knew at least this much.\u201cWhy is ANC so careless with this fund? Don\u2019t they know who this is?\u201d\u201cThey would have taken more care if they knew.\u201d\u201cThe client funds management team should be fired.\u201dThe pension fund was for retired teachers in Connecticut, and that was at least a diamond box.\\nThe Education Association in Connecticut was very influential in American politics, as US Presidents almost always campaigned on education reform, and American citizens paid close attention to their schools. The Connecticut Education Association had been a strong voice in USA politics as the icon of education reform.\u201cThis fund will trumpet our name. We have to bring it in.\u201dMy voice held greed to the extent even I could hear it.\u201cIf we manage this well, Jonathan\u2026\u201dJonathan\u2019s smile was meaningful.\u201cThe New York firm will be dealing with the US pension funds.\u201d\u201cYes, we\u2019ll be killing two birds with one stone.\u201dAs Jonathan had said, this was the opportunity to attack the Bluestone group with an increase in size and be favorably noticed by the US government. Our stone will be profitable returns for our customers.\u201cWhat\u2019s the estimated price?\u201d\u201cAbout 1.2 to 1.8 billion dollars.\u201dThat meant we could buy control of fifty billion dollars worth of client funds deposits with One point Eight Billion, and Blue Rock and ANC will sell if the price is right, since they would be confident that they could get people to invest in them again. The problem was getting approved by the Financial Supervisory Commission\u2026I worked out the details of the plan, and Jonathan suddenly asked a question.\u201cYou\u2019ve never lived in America, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\\n\u201cHow do you know so much? I\u2019m not talking about your age. You\u2019re like\u2026\u201d\u201cAs if I\u2019m a professional?\u201d\u201cMore so than that Bluestone team.\u201d\u201cMy father works in finance.\u201d\u201cNew York? Washington? Wouldn\u2019t I know his name if he managed to raise a son like you?\u201dJonathan\u2019s eyes shone as he thought he had stepped closer to my mystery.\u201cHe\u2019s in Seoul and not famous. He\u2019s a good father, though. Now, I\u2019ll leave the rest up to you.\u201d\u201cMe alone?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m stuck in Seoul, and you forget that I\u2019m underage.\u201d\u201cYeah, right.\u201d\u201cAll right, let\u2019s wrap this up and move on to the next.\u201d\u201cNext?\u201d\u201cWhy are you surprised? Aren\u2019t we going to move the offshore funds lying dormant?\u201d***\\nWhatever the reason was, those few months were a golden time for me and helped me build the foundation to change my career path from London to Wall Street.If he had not died young, Gillian would have made his name in financial history. I arrived at Wall Street, and I went to 245 Park Avenue, where the Morgan Group\u2019s property management team was located. It was true that I was a bit worried until I found Gillian\u2019s name in the building lobby.\u201cDo you have an appointment?\u201dOf course, I did not. This was not a place where a young Asian man could come in with confidence, and Gillian did not belong in a team that met with customers. He would be managing the Freeman Group account about now.\u201cCan you tell him that I\u2019m from England?\u201dWhile the receptionist did not look happy, she did what I asked. The answer immediately came back as negative. I asked her to hand Gillian a memo and waited for him from the caf\u00e9 across the street. I remembered my first days in Wall Street looking at the view from the window, and old memories became clearer.I remembered quietly going back to Korea like a fugitive and the Day of Advent a few days later. As I was reminiscing about the past, I realized that it was near dinnertime from how the building shadows darkened.Gillian came inside the caf\u00e9, and while he was younger and had a different hairstyle, I instantly recognized him. However, his face was as dark as a raincloud. I waved, and his face became even darker.He looked around and confirmed that I was the only one who was looking for him. Gillian sat in front of me and asked me in a suspicious voice, which was only natural.\u201cI heard that you came from England.\u201dI said the words that I had been preparing.\u201cI think I have been misunderstood. I\u2019m not from England but came to take you back to England. I\u2019m Ethan.\u201dGillian stared at me with vacant eyes and shook my hand. I could feel that he wanted to return to his home country, England, very badly.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Of course, I had only spent an hour or two per class for a semester a long time ago. This may be a new side of his personality, but Gillian was not a person who would be so down, at least to my experience. He graduated at the top of his class in 1991 at London University and entered the Morgan group in the same year. He would earn impressive profits with bond products and earn promotions in 1994 with the derivative products he had developed. In 1995, he participated in establishing the Morgan Group\u2019s trading system, and it would be the foundation of the Group for a long time. He would be called to the New York head office in 1996 to lead in managing the Group\u2019s head office. (EN: Derivatives are securities that derive their value from an underlying asset or benchmark. Common derivatives include futures contracts, forwards, options, and swaps. Most derivatives are not traded on exchanges and are used by institutions to hedge risk or speculate on price changes in the underlying asset.)Gillian had given Morgan record-breaking profits, but his expression did not show it. Why? His career should be taking off during this time.\u201cThis is unexpected\u2026Ethan.\u201dIt took Gillian a second to remember the name I had used to introduce myself.\u201cThe person that your clients are looking for is not here. Well, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll get the news. I appreciate the offer, but I\u2019m going to be fired from Morgan soon.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a secret that Morgan lost huge amounts of money during the Asian financial crisis, and out of the two divisions that suffered the greatest losses, I was in charge of one. I\u2019m not making up this story to refuse your offer, and if you read last week\u2019s issue of the Wall Street Journal, you\u2019ll know all.\u201dI had been preparing my manuscript last week, and Gillian offered me another bitter smile as I remained silent. He stood up, and he started walking away from me before I could do anything. I chased after him.\u201cDon\u2019t you want to return to your country?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be only a laughingstock. I cannot return like this.\u201d***\u2018I had gotten used to the fear in the market last year. Therefore, I thought my past achievements and my position was more important than the entry point. However, I was wrong. Compared to the bad, very bad entry points the Group was forced to swallow at the time, all my years, my contributions meant nothing.\u2019 (EN: Entry point refers to the price at which an investor buys or sells a security. The entry point is usually a component of a predetermined trading strategy for minimizing investment risk and removing the emotion from trading decisions. A good entry point is often the first step in achieving a successful trade. Obviously, a bad entry point means losses.)Gillian stopped his train of thoughts there.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about the Asian financial crisis last year.\u201dHe looked into my eyes and saw understanding, and Gillian\u2019s gaze changed a bit after that..\\n\u201cIt was not only you, but everyone lost money during last year. My clients were livid.\u201dGillian shook his head.\u201cOne earned it big, and your clients should find a manager like him.\u201dGillian mentioned Jonathan, but his words were not all positive. His frown spoke more. That was how Wall Street thought of Jonathan, and thus, indirectly me.If an infinite number of monkeys sat in front of typewriters, one of them might write \u2018Hamlet.\u2019 My interventions in the finance market were treated like that, a theoretically possible, but incredibly implausible event. It was sheer and amazing luck, like a monkey writing Shakespeare. Their egos made them think like that, and Jonathan\u2019s luck was accentuated in Wall Street rather than his skill, to rationalize their collective failure.\u201cWell, you are right. Who does not want such profit? It\u2019s everyone\u2019s dream. However, my clients are looking for consistent profit and a strong mentality. I\u2019m talking about you.\u201d\u201cThey don\u2019t know me. I lost a billion dollars.\u201dGillian spoke like he was confessing.\u201cYou have earned Morgan more during last year and the year before that, and as I have mentioned, the Asian financial crisis\u2026was a unique incident.\u201d\u201cThank you. I never thought I would be consoled like this.\u201dHis tone was sharper than his words.\u201cIf you make a decision, I will persuade my clients.\u201d \u201cYou said you\u2019ll establish your firm in England.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s planned to be built on the Isle of Man.\u201dGillian only nodded his head at the famous tax haven, as he also thought that was the right choice. He then asked the next question, which should have been the first.\u201cHow much funds are there to manage?\u201d\u201cFifteen billion dollars.\u201dGillian was yet again not surprised.\\n\u201cThere is a directing team that represents the companies my clients own, and I can promise you that they are very skilled. My clients want you to follow the specific directions under the initial plan, and we will be hiring you as our top executive trader.\u201dI saw the disappointment in Gillian\u2019s face, as he would have wanted directing rights. My offer was the same as what he was doing in the Morgan Group, as their property management team worked like this. They did not give a star player freedom, and each team had their specialized fields, and much of the work was done by computer programs. I spoke again.\u201cYou have to follow the investment plan, but we will not intervene in the specifics and trading method. I am telling you that you can manage the funds as you wish under the plan, without repercussions and as aggressively as you can.\u201dI planned to pile on incentives so he would not have a chance to refuse.\u201cSome of my clients desire to invest in you separately, but not now. If you show results, then\u2026\u201dI emphasized the magic phrase that will bring Gillian into my team.\u201cThey will gladly invest ten billion dollars.\u201dGillian acted like his innermost thoughts had been revealed, and his eyes were wild for a moment. The reason Gillian stayed in Morgan despite his genius was simple. While he had been presented with such plans before, he stayed with Morgan for that ten billion.\u2018From the first, I said to myself I would not return until I am the manager of ten billion dollars.\u2019As he mentioned in his lecture, Gillian succeeded in going back to England with the investment and built a global property management firm there. While I messed up his original plans, it was the last piece I needed to bring Gillian over to me. So, the butterflies flew like that. (EN: Those Chaos Theory butterflies are everywhere!)Gillian seemed to be over the tipping point with me and my funds, and I thought we had an agreement.\u201cYou haven\u2019t asked about my clients.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not in a position to do so. Truthfully, if it is not drug money, I don\u2019t care.\u201dAs I expected, Gillian had stopped thinking things over. I wanted to see a mirror since I would hate it if my glee was showing on my face.\u201cYou can relax, they\u2019re not. My clients will be able to provide you with more funds once the investment firm is set up in the Isle of Man. This is just another investment for them.\u201dGillian nodded calmly, as he had seen many rich people like that before. Morgan had many such clients, and the group itself was one of them. Also, he would have met a lot of people like \u2018Ethan,\u2019 who had come from the tax havens. They were trust company lawyers from the Cayman Islands and the four major accounting firms called the BIG 4 in Wall Street.While Jonathan would not have met such people often since he had been a small fry, Gillian would have met them every day. Therefore, I was not someone special to Gillian, and he had no reason to be tense in front of me. He asked.\u201cWhat are the contract conditions?\u201d\\nWhile I emphasized the word managing, Jonathan did not notice it.Then, the probability was less than 1%, as the offshore funds were that difficult to trace. The firms we had given the job had survived since WW2, and I had used eight of them round-robin style.\\nThings became quiet for a moment.Jonathan\u2019s voice was shaking, which was a bit strange.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tax havens were like that, and Wall Street\u2019s elites sent their funds to the Caymans, offshore insurance money went to Bermuda, terrorism and Columbian drug money went to Panama and Nevada, both Latin American gang funding and the \u201cretirement\u201d funds from Latin American dictators and oligarchs went to Florida, European securities firm funds went to Ireland and Luxembourg, Asian funds went to Hong Kong, and most of the other European funds went to Crown dependencies like he Bailiwick of Jersey and Isle of Man or Switzerland.Of course, as the funds increased, multiple tax havens were used. However, as tax havens are chosen based on utility and convenience, the above framework still holds. Therefore, Carl, an old agent who introduced himself as a villain with a smile, recommended Switzerland. On the other hand, his office did not suit a villain. The office boasted a 180-degree panoramic view, and he was sitting behind a a window with a lovely overlook of Central Park. I once had a passionate relationship with a girl with attractive red hair there.Carl spoke as he stared at the window with me.\u201cThe view from my office is my second favorite thing to boast about. It is peaceful. While New York is competitive, one can find peace in Central Park. That\u2019s why I recommend Switzerland, as the country is Europe\u2019s Central Park with deep tradition and history. Switzerland is that rare country that is not influenced by global politics and will remain neutral even if World War 3 comes. Safety is best.\u201dHe requested seven million dollars to establish the company by proxy and an annual maintenance fee of five million.\u201cIt will only take a day.\u201dMoney was not a problem.\u201cMy clients are determined that the firm is on the Isle of Man.\u201dAs my stance did not change, Carl quickly changed directions.\u201cDo as you wish. I only want to build long-term trust.\u201dIt was true. While there were many tax havens all over the world, Switzerland was the most secretive. However, that was only until 1997, and in this year, 1998, the Holocaust will come to haunt the Gnomes of Z\u00fcrich from an unexpected direction. (EN: Gnomes of Z\u00fcrich is a slang term for Swiss bankers. Swiss bankers are popularly associated with extremely secretive policies, while gnomes in fairy tales live underground, in secret, counting their riches. Z\u00fcrich is the commercial centre of Switzerland.)It was not only the dormant funds of the Jewish victims, with almost impossible proof-of-ownership requirements, but the laundering of Nazi funds, like something out of a bad novel, that was revealed to the world. As a result, Swiss banks will be attacked and they will surrender to the massive public outcry. That was the true reason I came to Carl\u2019s office, out of the many agent offices that managed the funds we took out of the Asian Financial crisis.\\nIn 1998, this year, the documents that will make Swiss banks capitulate came from this office.***Jonathan had always been worried that the offshore billions would be discovered, and we would be imprisoned for the rest of our lives. However, while the probability was less than 1%, I had come to Carl\u2019s office to nullify even that single percent. The last agent to handle our offshore funds had been Carl, and he seemed to be deeply interested in the briefcase I had brought with me and now placed on the table.I stood up to lock the office door, and this act alarmed Carl. It did not take long for Carl to shout into his phone, and while he yelled a name I thought to be his secretary, Carl and I were alone in the offices. I had not asked to meet during lunch without reason.\u201cDon\u2019t be scared.\u201dI spoke coldly as I approached Carl and took the phone away from him first. I did it slowly but with force, and it did not matter whether Carl had tried to resist. The phone slid from his fingers when our eyes met, and his eyes were filled with fear.People had those eyes when they had faced monsters at the Trial Tests, and Carl had also seen one in me for a moment.\u201cI only want a confidential conversation with you without interference.\u201dCarl did not open his mouth, and it was evident that he was busy calculating how to safely get out of this situation. He avoided my eyes and looked about the office. He glanced at the fountain pen on the desk and the computer keyboard. Stabbing a person in the neck with a fountain pen takes courage rather than skill, and his gaze then stopped on the briefcase containing a million dollars in bearer bonds with coupons attached I had brought with me. His mouth opened then.\u201cHave you come from a gang?\u201dWhether it be a terrorist, a gangster, or a drug dealer, one acted as a Wall Street finance manager in an agent\u2019s office. Therefore, it was difficult to recognize them in a place like this. Carl would have only met those who wore nice suits, talked knowledgeably about money, and acted politely like people who worked in the banks across the street.Carl looked confused at my smile and the fact I had not done anything after I stopped the phone call he attempted. I had actually gone back to my seat and calmly sat down.\\n\u201cYou deal in gang money?\u201dCarl\u2019s eyes came back to normal at my words.\u201cSay what you want, and don\u2019t scare me.\u201dHe acknowledged that he was weaker than me. While we were similar in height and build, he had given up physically attacking me perhaps because of his age. I opened my briefcase and showed him the million in bearer bonds. Carl\u2019s pupils dilated, and he involuntarily licked his lips.\u201cThis is a million in bearer bonds. This is payment for using your computer.\u201dCarl did not understand what I was saying at first, but his eyes suddenly widened.\u201cThis is a problem. I know what you\u2019re searching for, but it\u2019s not here. We keep our client\u2019s names our top-secret\u2026\u201dI stood up again, and the room suddenly became tense again.\u201cLike Swiss banks!\u201dCarl shouted in a rush, and he was not stupid enough to move like he was protecting the computer. I was looking down on him, and he was looking up to me. I spoke only one word.\u201cMove.\u201dMy voice rang in the room.\\n \u201cIf it\u2019s too much of a burden, keep it as a retainer. Finish establishing the investment firm in the Isle of Man.\u201dAll of these agents left behind evidence, and I could not do this every time.

However, the world I lived in was completely different now, and therefore there was a more effective method. As I sat down again in my seat, Carl kept glancing at me as he swallowed aspirin without water. However, he spoke with his hand on his forehead like he still had a headache.\u201cThere are employees outside.\u201dWhile that meant I should not do anything violent, Carl\u2019s voice was weak.\u201cI want you to call Jane in.\u201dI spoke as I pointed at the firm nameplate on the wall.[Carl &amp; Jane Legal Accounting Firm]Carl was the lawyer, and Jane, his partner, was the accountant in this firm. Their office was located in a street where the majority of the businesses were accounting and legal firms. The bookshelves were filled with books appropriate for the facade, but the firm\u2019s true identity was an agent for tax havens, and their history for less than reputable services went back to their founding by Carl\u2019s grandparents, whose pictures were proudly hung on the walls.\u201cI did what you wanted. What do you want?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to have to buy this firm.\u201dCarl\u2019s expression turned strange, but his color returned, showing him that he was a true business man.***Could one believe that this small office with only six employees made millions of dollars annually in profit? Moreover, they did not pay taxes to the US government, as their firm was located in the Caymans on paper while their office was in New York. Therefore, this firm was not tracked on any Law Enforcement databases.Carl told me multiple times that I must not threaten Jane, his wife, like I threatened him. If I did not promise, he would definitely not call his partner in business and in private life.However, that was unnecessary, as I had already changed tactics even before she arrived in the office. While I was shameless, it was because I was beginning to want this firm more and more.Carl was also just as brazen, as we remained awkwardly polite, pretending to be old business acquaintances in front of his wife. Jane was a middle-aged woman who would look just as natural taking cookies out of the oven as holding a pile of documents. She said she would love spending time in the Cayman Islands and saw their future suntanning in a big manor surrounded by palm trees.\\nThey were in their late fifties and were at an age that yearned for retirement. Jane spoke up.\u201cI do not want other accounting firms hired or involved in this transaction. I believe you would know the reason why.\u201dA multi-million deal to purchase these offices would involve countless negotiations between the involved parties and their accounting firms, but she confirmed that there would not be a need for such a public process. I welcomed it since we were dealing with preserving secrets and retaining the current personnel infrastructure. As far as the public is concerned, nothing has changed.We did not need to hire accounting firms, who would inevitably reveal the sale. Should their customers learn of the sale, they would fear a record of their transactions falling into the hands of a third party, breaking their long, trusted relationship with Carl and Jane. (EN: Yep, Jane is obviously the real brains. ^_^ )***While I bought the tax agent firm, I had additional reasons to come to New York, even going so far as to lie to my parents. One was to gather my knights for my financial empire, as I had the money and could not hold it off any longer. I had to take them while they were vulnerable, before they learned to believe in their abilities, and had a chance to establish their own independent businesses.I found my second knight in the New York Stock Exchange. Her name was Jessica, which was a common enough name, but she had a rare ability. While her connections in University didn\u2019t include anyone special and she did not come from a rich family, she was a woman who broke the glass ceiling of the Wall Street elites. (EN: Glass Ceiling-an unofficially acknowledged barrier to advancement in a profession, especially affecting women and members of minorities.)It did not take much effort to find Jessica, who was working as a mere phone secretary in the Stock Exchange. I found her amongst a crowd who were looking at food trucks during lunchtime. The rest of the five except Gillian had not spread their wings yet, and with the exception of Cheongsoo Kim, the rest would have to be trained under Gillian.About a week after I arrived in New York, I scouted four of the five, including Gillian, and I went to the \u201cback alleys\u201d of Wall Street for the second reason I came here. Wall Street did not have back alleys where drunks wandered, gang members walked about with guns, and prostitutes were glimpsed here and there. The place we called \u201cback alleys\u201d were clean streets with tall buildings where the elite walked. (EN: Yeah, I\u2019m confused too. Jonathan, Gillian, Jessica is three. )However, the firms there were the reason we called them \u201cback alleys\u201d, as there were two kinds of agencies there. One was tax agent firms like the one I had just bought, and the other was private investigating firms.While they were better known as private detectives, they did not investigate murders in locked rooms, and those located in Wall Street conducted investigations for investors and insurance companies.Since the one I used in my past was not established yet, I looked for the cleanest sign. A clean sign would mean they had opened recently and their investigators probably had worked as police officers, federal agents, or in the military up to now. From my experience, American private investigators did not differ much from Korea in retaining the privileges of their former jobs, as well as multiple connections in law enforcement and the military to make up for any lack.The firm\u2019s interior was clean as the sign, and I had chosen a good place.\u201cOver here, please.\u201dThe consultant looked over my attire after my face. I wore high-end clothing and shoes, and what I wore did not differ from the other elites on Wall Street.\\n\u201cHave you worked with us before?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dI was led to a meeting room as a regular customer, and the consultant handed me their booklet. The firm\u2019s name was ZOPI Group, and the booklet actually was too thick to read in one sitting. The pages were filled with their eighty investigators\u2019 expertise and how the organization was well knit and their investigators professional. The consultant turned over to the page that she deemed would suit me, and it was a list of their successful investment evaluations. One page held the details of an investigation that discovered a sex scandal between a founder of a famous food product company and underage boys as an example of ZOPI minimizing the founding partners\u2019 financial losses with the work of their operatives.\u201cI did not come here to request an investigation.\u201dI took out a fake name card that was no longer fake, as with the exception of my name, the company in the Caymans was one of the two established yesterday. I used one to buy the tax agent firm and the other to change my identity.The consultant stared at the company name on the card before asking me a question.\u201cYou\u2019re a trust manager. Do you need to talk to a manager?\u201d\u201cAnyone at partner level and is available now.\u201d\u201cFollow me.\u201d***The investigator\u2019s hand was full of scars as I shook it, and I could see traces of his military tattoo on his upper arm. His hair was cut short, and I could see his sharp eyes and sturdy features. He had to have been in the army until recently.\u201cI am John Clarke.\u201dHe looked at me like he had sensed something.\u201cI\u2019m Ethan.\u201d\u201cWe do a lot of work for trust companies, mostly finding the beneficiaries.\u201d\\n\u201cVermont, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut, and Pennsylvania. New York neighbors five states.\u201d\u201cWe know that this request is beyond rational thought. However, the fee is the issue, right?\u201dThe investigator looked at the name card the consultant had handed to him.\u201cNo. What Gold Run Trusts is requesting is basically a search of the entire North America continent.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThe fee is not the problem. John, this is Wall Street. Do I have to consult another firm?\u201dThe investigator\u2019s expression turned a bit rigid, and his answer was rushed.\u201cI meant that the investigation fee may exceed the benefits.\u201dHe was questioning whether the firm was willing to go that far, and I spoke as if I was disappointed.\u201cYou can say that because you do not know the amount. Do not worry about the fee, and work on this project with as many people as necessary. Cooperate with other partner firms, as you may have to search the entire continent.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re serious?\u201d\u201cYes. We will pay you an incentive bonus for saved time and a success pay at the market\u2019s highest rate. Prepare the contract.\u201dThe investigator was at a loss for words at my request and the fee.\u201cWe need to find Bobby no matter what the cost is. Will you help?\u201dI had to find that kid even if I bought out every private investigation firm in North America. That [email protected]@rd would grow to be the Prime Evil, who will lead the Eight Evils.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

First, I was arranging for logging on the mountain where the F-class dungeon was sealed. Second, I was expanding Jonathan Investments. Third, I was establishing a new investment company worth fifteen billion dollars on the Isle of Man, and fourth, I was looking for the Prime Evil and my last knight, Cheongsoo Kim.The manuscript I finished editing on the plane back to Korea was for my second operation.\u201cThe negotiation had gone well, but ANC and Blue Rock are worried that the Financial Supervisory Commission will not approve, as we are.\u201d\u201cI have several things to tell you, so let\u2019s start there.\u201dI took out my laptop and felt Jonathan\u2019s stare. He felt that something was different with my tone, as I had always been polite and distant when speaking to him.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about this first.\u201dI opened the manuscript file and handed Jonathan the laptop. I saw Jonathan slowly smile looking at me, as I showed him what I had written.\u201cDo I have something on my face? Look at the monitor.\u201dJonathan\u2019s eyes finally turned to the monitor, and he asked me what this was.\u201cANC and Blue Rock mentioning the Financial Supervisory Commission\u2019s approval was an insult, as they\u2019re saying that the only way this deal will go through will be if we\u2019re lucky. I was reminded of the attitude Wall Street has of you, Jonathan, that you had hit the jackpot just by sheer luck.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not me, it\u2019s you. Don\u2019t be so touchy, Sun. So, this is\u2026a manuscript. Did you write this?\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s talk after you read it.\u201d\\nJonathan seemed interested as he looked over the manuscript, and his scrolling slowed down as he read it. He looked back and forth at me and the manuscript as he again asked me a question.\u201cThis is not an autobiography, but an investment manual. How can a thirteen-year-old think of this? You could predict trends with this book, and monopolize positions even if your brain doesn\u2019t work like a genius. Moreover, your analysis of Predictive Modelling\u2026damn. You don\u2019t have a degree, right?\u201dThe answer was clear, and Jonathan answered by himself.\u201cYou were planning our revenge, and this is hot stuff. Everyone will be blown away by this, and no one will be able to claim \u2018Luck\u2019 anymore! Our credibility will be untouchable!\u201dWhile Jonathan was over exaggerating things, everything was about results. I just wrote up the theories I remembered from my past life, which have yet to be published or even created by their original authors, to explain our investment strategies to something a normal human being could understand.\u201cJonathan, I\u2019m not the author and left the foreword blank. Write up something about your childhood and how you grew up, and also how you became a financial investment manager and started on Wall Street.\u201dJonathan shook his head violently at my words, which was a clear refusal. I had expected this response and asked him a question.\u201cDo you know the Asian concept of Yin and Yang?\u201d\u201cA bit.\u201d\u201cYin and Yang suggest nothing can live in isolation, as Yin cannot exist without Yang and vice versa. The two need to be in harmony for things to work. I\u2019m saying that you and I work like that.\u201d\u201cI wish you would step out of the shadows, but it can\u2019t be helped.\u201d\u201cYes, this argument ends today. Don\u2019t think that you\u2019re stealing my achievements because you\u2019re just doing something for me that I can\u2019t do.\u201d\\n\u201cUntil you come of age.\u201d\u201cSo enjoy it while you can so you won\u2019t regret it. A moment will come when I take back what\u2019s mine.\u201dI grew apart from my childhood friends when I studied in Britain and worked as an investment manager in New York. I only had colleagues after that, and it was the same when I had been Awakened.Awakened could not become friends, and it had been the same for Jonathan and me. We were in a completely business relationship and shared profits and points, not friendship. I had thought that would remain the same in this life, but Jonathan was not who I had known. His nature did not belong in Wall Street, as he was gentle and had a streak of kindness.When he asked me to become his friend, I thought that I could afford this single luxury\u2026***Jonathan returned to New York with the manuscript yesterday, and his departure was quieter than his arrival. Those who had come to greet him and others went back to the new president\u2019s inauguration ceremony. His departure was written in small letters in the daily newspaper.That morning, Carl and Jane\u2019s people had sent greeting emails, the investigating firm sent me pictures of numerous candidates for Bobby, and Jillian had given me a progress report after going back to Britain. However, the news I had been waiting for the most was delayed.I went there using a car I had rented under Jeonil\u2019s name, as dealing with traffic cops in these times required cash rather than a driver\u2019s license. I just needed to avoid big accidents.\\nThe dungeon entrance had been about two hundred meters to the northeast, and the entrance that could unseal the dungeon would be there somewhere. I began to walk faster and then started to run.I could guess the spots where the dirt would crumble under my feet before I stepped, which reminded me that I had been Awakened, with high perception attributes back then, and now. I ran the sharp incline for about two hundred meters and looked around for the entrance.I only needed to enter the radius of the entrance like the Awakened who had discovered the dungeon by accident, and then the dungeon would reveal itself.I wandered about and found a spot where the notification I had been waiting for appeared. The System message I had hoped for appeared, and I received the achievement I had expected.[Congratulations, you are the First to discover a Dungeon!][You have gained the achievement \u2018Like the Deep Sea.\u2019]Other notifications followed.[You have gained the trait \u2018Explorer\u2019 due to the achievement.][Congratulations, you are the first to discover this dungeon.][You have received a challenger box for being the first to find a dungeon.]It was not a bronze, silver, or gold, not even platinum or a diamond box. I saw a shining box that seemed to be screaming at me to open it. I felt my heart skip a bit and reached out with my hand to open the shining box, that would light my way into the future.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I did not care as long as the skill belonged to the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues, as their skills had been the best of the best.[You have opened the challenger box.]What will my third challenger box give me? The almost blinding light from the opening of a challenger box was welcome to me.[You have gained the insignia \u2018Revival.\u2019]While everything had been bright, I could see that the light had gathered instead of spreading, and had landed on my chest. And a ray of light was now connecting me to the opened box, and I took off my jacket and shirt the moment the light vanished. While my hurry to see it actually slowed me down and I ripped my shirt and popped some buttons taking it off, it was nothing compared to what I saw in the middle of my chest.While it looked like only a tattoo a bit bigger than my thumbnail, I was overjoyed at having received an insignia from a challenger box. While many lower-grade boxes gave out insignias, I had never heard of one that merited a challenger box, and it was even called \u2018Revival!\u2019 I could guess what the insignia\u2019s effect was and checked to see if I was right.[Revival (Insignia)Effect: One time only, it will revive the bearer from death.Class: S]\u201cAll right\u2026\u201dInsignias had been special even for civilians because even the Unawakened could bear them. They could be sold on the market, and the prices had been astounding. This meant that I could protect anyone I wanted from a fatal injury once, and my joy was soured by my past hardships. I had hunted thousands of times and waited for a cruelly long time to finally receive an insignia.I did not think that this had been too easily acquired this time but in fact I had been thinking of my parents when the Revival insignia came out of the box.***\\n[Will you open the dungeon?]I refused, as it was too early. Opening the dungeon would endanger those living in the village, despite that the possibility of monsters coming out was extremely low due to this dungeon being a Class-F.Like the infinitesimal possibility of my paper companies being discovered existed, the danger of monsters coming out of an open dungeon also existed.I took the fishing lines that I had bought on the way here and used four 100 meter fishing lines and some stakes to designate and mark the areas before taking out my cell phone. I breathed in deeply to calm myself down.Choi came back and entered the area I marked with the fishing lines, but he did not see any System notifications. If he had seemed surprised, it meant that he was a prior awakened, but they had been very rare, especially in Korea.\u201cIt seems about a thousand square meters. You will need to flatten the ground to raise a building, so when will you do it? What is the scale of construction?\u201dHe spoke in a desperate voice.\u201cThis request from the company is something that you probably have not done before, and I don\u2019t know whether or not you can do it.\u201d\u201cTell me about it.\u201d\u201cWe require that you not touch the ground at all, and we have to raise a building with the walls built where they\u2019re marked, according to the fishing lines.\u201d\\n\u201cWithout a floor, or basement\u2026? It will work. We will find a way.\u201d\u201cThe problem is the walls. The firm wants the strongest ones made of steel reinforced concrete at least five meters thick.\u201dChoi was at a loss for words, as I had said I wanted walls that were used for Bank Vaults.\u201cThe plan is to raise another concrete wall around the mountain after the building is complete, and we will use multiple layers of wire mesh fences and CCTVs to prevent the village people from entering at the base. As I told you, the scale is quite big.\u201d\u201c\u2026Why?\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the purpose\u2026have you come from the government?\u201d Choi whispered the last word.\u201cWould I have come to you if I did? I do not know the specifics, as I only follow orders.\u201d\u201cHas this been approved? It seems to be a dangerous facility.\u201d \u201cYes, the company is going over relevant laws at the moment.\u201d\u201cI can do anything you want. Please let me do it. I will make sure you need worry about nothing, and I will bet my life to give you a masterpiece.\u201d\u201cDo you have a plan?\u201dIt was then Choi let out the words he had been holding back.\u201cI only have friends. Please listen to me. Every firm I know is tipping over, and when the big firms are nearly dead, for the small firms, our situation is much worse.\u201d\\n \u201cI know a foreign firm and I will introduce you and endorse you, so you can borrow as much as they\u2019re willing to lend to you.\u201dChoi rushed and hugged me, and he smelled like wet ground. However, I could not push him away, as he was now crying in earnest. I felt his weight, which reminded me of the burdens he carried with him. Damn, Father had cried like this with Mother on the day he had been fired.\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cI\u2026apologize.\u201d\u201cI have not finished talking. That foreign firm will ask for a share of more than 51% in return for the investment. Your management rights will not be guaranteed, and this is up to you. Of course, everything will be decided after the firms you will buy pass the investment firm\u2019s standards.\u201d\u201cJust having this chance\u2026\u201d\u201cI hope it works well and wish you luck.\u201d\u201cYes! I won\u2019t forget this until the day I die.

While such requests would inevitably raise questions in Choi\u2019s mind, the building itself was already mysterious enough.\u201cNo matter what I say, the firm is constructing an ugly building. It will look awkward, and once it is built, reporters and local politicians will come running. Large firms are weak against such pressures.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cLarge construction firms co-exist with the media and local politicians, so they will not be able to refuse their requests.\u201d\u201cI understand what you\u2019re saying, and I will remember every word.\u201d \u201cWhile such a thing should not happen, the firm has taken the position that it would be easier to control your small company instead of hiring a big construction firm. I made this point at the board meeting, to try and get you the contract.\u201d\u201cYou have\u2026done so much for me. I will make sure you have nothing to worry about.\u201d \u201cYou do not have to pay much attention to the investment company, as it is busy with other businesses. Your company is a sort of test case they have bought to prepare to enter Korea\u2019s construction market.\u201dChoi gulped at the words.\u201cMoreover, you may suddenly be requested to hand over documents detailing various aspects of your company for stockholder meetings, and if you think keeping foreign investment companies satisfied is easy, due to distance\u2026I cannot help you. They can be extremely cruel.\u201d\u201cYes, I know that you\u2019re speaking out of worry. I will not forget this debt for three generations.\u201dThe contract was nearly over, and Choi said he would take me to a good place instead of drinking lukewarm coffee. By his tone, I guessed that Choi had prepared liquor, women, and a thick envelope filled with cash.\\nThe chance I had given Choi could not be paid with such things, and Choi also knew it. His eyes looked like he would do anything I say. Anyway, I refused his offer and continued to talk about the construction of the village caf\u00e9. I spoke about the fact that the firm is prepared to continue building such projects in the future, to continue buying the goodwill of the locals.\u201cAt the risk of sounding forward, won\u2019t that become a problem in the future?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good point, and I am also worried about that. While I am obeying the orders from the higher-ups, this is my responsibility. If something goes seriously wrong in this project, I will be fired.\u201d\u201cSir.\u201d \u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a mountain behind where I live, but no one goes up there. While it\u2019s not as big as the wall planned for this facility, there\u2019s a long wall surrounding the mountain. However, the reason no one goes up that mountain is not because of the wall.\u201d\u201cIs it a mental hospital?\u201d\u201cThat may also work. However, the wall is topped by traditional roof tiles, and the road going up is blocked by a traditional gate. It looks like a temple to outsiders, but they all came back down in disgust.\u201dIt was then Choi spoke a name I had heard for the first time.\u201cHave you ever heard of a religious organization called the Church of the Spirit World?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cI also heard the name for the first time after I moved into that area. No one knows what they do, and while everyone dislikes even looking at the direction of the mountain, no one ever filed a complaint.\u201d\\n\u201cI understand, as religious cults are scary.\u201d\u201cWho knows what they will do.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know what to say since I do not know the purpose of the building, but I will ask the higher-ups whether the project needs such elaborate disguise.\u201d\u201cOh, no. I only said this in passing.\u201d\u201cSince this is just a suggestion, you have no reason to worry. Since there will be many projects like this, the higher-up will also need to think about such problems if they want to proceed forward. They will choose the best solution out of many suggestions, and I thank you for the idea.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not that much of an idea, and I hope that it helps.\u201d\u201cYou can go first since I need to organize some things here.\u201d\u201cThen, I will contact you once I start.\u201dChoi left. The best solution for securing the dungeon would be to sign a contract with the military and raise the walls as part of the defense industry, but there would be far too many questions. So, rather than bringing other elements here, disguising the buildings as mental hospitals or cult facilities may be more effective. They both raise primal fear in people even before approaching, especially in these times.I finished making some decisions and moved my gaze to the table. It was filled with documents Choi had brought, and I had to look them over just in case.I took out the copy of his national ID card with his Citizen Registration Number and family register, as I could confirm his family relations and previous homes with those documents. While I wanted to trust Choi, who seemed trustworthy, I also knew that such a belief was na\u00efve.***\\nWe had to do Father\u2019s funeral without a grave or ashes, and I cried while holding the passbook he had given me when I had been a student. Also, I blamed myself and the military. I understood why they had to re-activate me from my reserve status, but I believed Father would not have been sacrificed like this if they had not kept me in. (EN: A passbook or bankbook is a paper book used to record bank or building society transactions on a deposit account. Traditionally, a passbook is used for accounts with a low transaction volume, such as savings accounts.) (EN: A building society is a financial institution owned by its members as a mutual organization.)I did not return to the military after Father\u2019s funeral and went to a foreign private guild whose offer I had refused a few times in the past. I secured Mother\u2019s safety by working for them, and the period I worked there had been due to Father\u2019s death.Of course, history was changing, and such a thing would not happen again. However, it was not a reason not to transfer the insignia over to Father. While he had lived a healthy life until now, I did not know what would happen to him in the future. There may be natural catastrophes and building collapses, and one really did not know what would happen tomorrow.I only regretted that I only had one insignia, and I looked in the direction of the master bedroom and turned my gaze back to Father. I used the System Menu only the Awakened could use.[Will you transfer ownership of the Revival insignia?]\u201cYes.\u201dThe system asked again.[Will you transfer ownership of the Revival insignia?]Since the insignia was from a challenger box, the system was asking why I was handing over another chance to live like this, especially when I would have to go to the dungeon alone. Well, I did not think that the system would understand such a thing.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He said that he didn\u2019t know anything about this and called those he drank with as he tried to piece together the night before.Mother almost cried, saying that her husband was having an affair, and I did not know what to do. After Father managed to go to work, I made an effort to console her. We went to Myeong-dong at lunchtime, and while we did not talk much, her face became happier just by walking arm in arm with me among the crowds. (EN: Bustling Myeong-dong is a shopping area packed with international fashion brands, luxury department stores and homegrown cosmetics shops.)I bought her a hairpin when she stopped by a street seller selling accessories, and it was a red butterfly shape. I said that I had some allowance saved, and she spoke as she touched the hairpin.\u201cThank you, son. I\u2019ll treasure it. This reminds me of old times since we haven\u2019t spent much time together after you went to middle school. We were always together until last year. Don\u2019t you remember?\u201d \u201cDo you feel better?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say it. I can\u2019t talk about this anymore because I\u2019m so embarrassed.\u201d\u201cFather\u2026can make a mistake. Just let it go this once.\u201d\u201cWhy did he do such a thing?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a small one and won\u2019t be noticed at work.\u201d\u201cYour father may be respected by those who work with him, but he\u2019s still a cheapskate. That\u2019s why he chose such a small size tattoo even when he was intoxicated.\u201dMother laughed as she remembered the insignia she had seen in the morning.\u201cDo you know how much tattoos cost? It seems expensive. Actually, ignore that. You shouldn\u2019t know such things.\u201dI must have smiled at imagining the price on a Revival insignia, as Mother seemed surprised.\u201cI\u2019m happy to spend some time outside with you like this.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t working at the curtain store difficult?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m just playing with nearby housewives. Your father is late every night and you are off playing on your own, so I need some time like that.\u201d\u201cPlease tell me if you\u2019re tired.\u201d\\n\u201cWhy, are you going to support me?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how I gave birth to such a good son.

I decided to hide the dungeon in the mountain as a mental hospital, and while a religious cult seemed better at keeping people away, the consequences would be severe if there was a problem.In the future, the government had not needed to care about such things, as dungeons were like nuclear bombs about to blow up to civilians. They just needed to post a sign that said a dungeon had appeared, and civilians would run for the hills before the Awakened and the military came.However, things were different now, and I needed to set up the mental hospital and after doing so, establish the relevant corporations and select a person to be a puppet administrator. I also needed to think about the safety of nearby civilians and follow construction codes, enough to pass inspections.However, the walls were a must even if the enclosed area was smaller, as monsters escaping was something too terrible for words.As a result, I gave up on the wall that would surround the mountain, and the wall circling just the facility was modified to be as tall as possible, within the relevant building codes. As for the puppet administrator\u2026***I needed someone with a medical license, and the individual\u2019s family members also had to be greedy for the corporate funds. Money was not a problem but keeping things secret was. While brokers could give me a list, I could not trust the broker. Actually, with the exception of a very few people, I didn\u2019t trust anyone.Betrayal was something that happened every day when money was involved, and those who seemed the most harmless would sell someone out for a few hundred thousand Won. It had been common in these hard times for people to betray others for a pittance and risk their lives for the same pitiful sums.It was the same risk here, and there were things I needed to keep secret, which meant those tasks that were relevant to dungeons were done by me. Also, I had to keep files on the involved parties in case a problem came up.Choi had been one, and this alcoholic in front of me was another.The man\u2019s face was filled with traces of having wasted his life, and he smelled of alcohol at noon.\u201cSo, how much is it?\u201d\u201cI will pay you four million won per month.\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t that too cheap when you\u2019re using a doctor\u2019s license?\u201d \u201cCan\u2019t I speak directly to Dr. Yang? I want to talk with him.\u201d\\n\u201cFrom tomorrow until Dr. Yang dies. So don\u2019t waste it on drinking and use some to take care of your father\u2019s health, as you will want the money for a long time.\u201d\u201cThat, I will\u2026\u201d\u201cDo as I require, and I will not see you again. If we meet again, Mr. Yang\u2026\u201dThe man was looking at my hands on the table.\u201cWe will not be meeting for a good reason.\u201dI took out a pen from my pocket and threw it at him.\u201cWrite down what I say.

She reported on the purchase of commercial buildings, factories, construction companies, apartments, hotels, and resorts while ticking each item off with her pencil. Jeonil Investment was buying bargain basement properties from large corporations, and the number we had purchased was beyond belief.\u201cWhile our current profit is only rent, we are certain that this country will repay the IMF loans, and the properties we\u2019ve accumulated so far will give Ethan\u2019s clients astronomical profits.\u201dShe would want Korea to overcome the IMF like no one else, as she had gained the authority to shake a country in the political and financial fields at a young age. She now realized the power Daehoo had in Korea after buying the group, and it was natural she would not want to give it up.Also, it looked like she thought that having a private relationship with me would be beneficial, as her outfits became more daring each time we met. I could not avoid seeing her thighs and bosom whenever she reported, and she \u201caccidentally\u201d touched my legs as she crossed her own.Jamie pretended to demurely avoid my gaze when I looked at her, and she would be thinking it would be almost too easy to allure a young Asian man acting as a proxy. I just laughed silently.\u201cThe group account should be quite empty. Am I wrong?\u201dJamie seemed to have waited for me to say the words.\u201cOur competitors think that we\u2019re giving up some items. You are right, the piggy bank is quite empty. We can only stare at some desirable items.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want the most?\u201d\u201cThis country is offering us a sale at prices that will never come again. Golden opportunities are everywhere you look. How can one pick the best? However, if it is truly necessary\u2026\u201dJamie\u2019s eyes were filled with a strange glint.\u201cI want to buy the Ilsung Electronics semiconductor business, Sia Motors, and Daehyeon Motors. While I want to buy the Ilsung group, Sia group and Daehyeon, those three divisions are the minimum.\u201d\u201cWho are you consulting with?\u201d\u201cThe East Asia Finance Research Institute. They are trustworthy. I\u2019m planning to buy a consulting company\u2026is there a problem?\u201dI did not and shook my head. Jamie continued to speak.\u201cThe consultants chose Ilsung Electronics semiconductor as having a high possibility of success and estimated that Daehyeon\u2019s semiconductor business would fail and damage the Daehyeon group to the core.\u201d\u201cYou seemed to have studied hard. How\u2019s work?\u201d\u201cThis country is paradise.\u201dJaimie also presented a proposal that Daehoo Motors, Daehyeon Motors, and Sia Motors could be merged together.\u201cYou\u2019ve already contacted the three groups. What was the result?\u201d\\nJamie\u2019s greedy eyes looked down, which told me the answer, and she seemed to have failed even after some effort. It was inevitable.\u201cThere\u2019s no way to get the core businesses. Ilsung and Daehyeon have twisted management share systems, and my accounting consultants all start by shaking their heads when talking about the two groups. It cannot be helped. Ethan, how interested are your clients in the Korean market?\u201dShe was proposing to shake Ilsung and Daehyeon like we had Daehoo.\u201cI know what you\u2019re thinking, but delay it for now.\u201d\u201cThis chance will not come again. Can\u2019t you persuade your clients? They will regret missing this opportunity after Korea overcomes its IMF crisis.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve already invested 25 billion dollars.\u201d\u201cI need 25 more.\u201dShe was saying that too easily.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know that the limits on foreign stock shareholders have been removed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why you\u2019re after Daehyeon and Ilsung? Jamie, this country will not allow Daehyeon, Ilsung, and Daehoo to merge into one group, and we will be attacked from everywhere when they see us try. They\u2019re already using public funds to bail out Daehyeon and Ilsung.\u201d\u201cThis is the IMF, Ethan.\u201d\u201cYes, this is the damn IMF crisis. Do I need to explain again?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMerging three groups will be a greater threat than the IMF for this country, not only for the government but for the chaebols. All three owned by a foreign firm will be even more serious. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s too much?\u201d (EN: A chaebol is a large industrial conglomerate that is run and controlled by an owner or family in South Korea. A chaebol often consists of many diversified affiliates, controlled by an owner whose power over the group often exceeds legal authority. )\u201cI\u2019m confused. Are you speaking for your clients?\u201d\u201cI mean that we have to maintain our current relationship with the government.\u201dWhile Jamie would think that our efforts crumbled Daehoo, that was wrong. I had just sped things up, and the conditions that led to Daehoo\u2019s ruin had already been there. In Korea, groups like Daehoo could not be attacked unless they fell by themselves, since the chaebols would unify under an external threat.\u201cYou\u2019re saying the same thing as our directors, and if you also say it, that means I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019ll modify my plans.\u201d\u201cThe real estate purchases are as expected.

I agree and am going to persuade my clients on that point.\u201dWhile the dollar ruled Korea for now, things would change after the IMF. The chaebols would again take charge instead of the dollar.\u201cWhile I refused before due to realistic reasons, the chaebols in this country would be the most delicious dishes.\u201dJamie strongly nodded her head.\u201cHowever, let\u2019s not hurry. This country\u2019s financial crisis is just beginning, and they need to stew a little more. How much do we have left?\u201d\u201cAbout a billion dollars.\u201dJamie took a summary and handed it to me. She had used ten billion to buy Daehoo, and fourteen billion to buy real estate.\u201cHave you talked with the government about the delay in restructuring Daehoo?\u201d\u201cIt was done on a condition that things will not start until April. Instead, the 25 billion dollars has been\u2026\u201dJamie did not continue, as she could not find a way to put into \u201csocially acceptable\u201d terms how Korea had laundered 25 billion dollars for us.\u201cThe delay is enough for the money laundering fees, and that much was necessary to make sure there will be no future issues.\u201d\u201cEthan!\u201dJamie jumped and rolled her eyes. It seemed she was still unused to my bluntness. This was perfect timing, as both the ruling party and the opposition party were complicit in laundering the funds for me.\u201cJaime, this country\u2019s government is the one with the weakness, not us.\u201d\\n\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cNothing.

The car\u2019s headlights were the only light source from here, as I had intentionally not placed any lights on the road. The bare mountain was like a dark ocean now, and it seemed like time had stopped, as if a massive wave was about to roll in.There were no stars in the sky, and only a half-moon looked down on the high wall surrounding the facility. On nights like this, we used to think about who would die that day.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI saw a tattered banner on the ground when I came out of the driver\u2019s seat. A few villagers had been protesting right here a few weeks ago. While they had become quiet after receiving compensatory funds (bribes), there was still trash that showed that people had been here. I kicked it away with my foot and raised my head. The wall looked bigger at night, and I stopped my reminiscences.I took out the items I had brought with me in the car trunk. I took the flashlight from a military backpack before shouldering the pack. I unsheathed the sword, and left the sheath in the trunk. I would not need the sheath where I was going. The trunk\u2019s red light also disappeared after it was closed, and the darkness was complete.I went to the only entrance of the wall, and the flashlight revealed a steel gate.[New Hope Mental Hospital]A CCTV was running above my head, and the empty hospital looked like it was abandoned. The bare gardens looked like it should be inhabited by ghosts, and as I walked up to the dungeon, I remembered my fellow Awakened who had died there. I remembered the screams of the traitors and the cheers of those who had gained boxes.Trust, deceit, faith, desire, despair, joy, love, hate, fear\u2026 Dungeons had all that since literally anything could happen. I had always gathered or joined people to go into dungeons with, since going solo into a dungeon was simply an exceptionally stupid and painful form of suicide.My heart was beating fast, which meant that I was feeling nervous.\u201cIt\u2019s only an F Class dungeon.\u201dHowever, murmuring that to myself did not help, as courage was irrelevant. Only someone who was crazy enough to not care whether they lived or died would go in alone with F-class stats into a dungeon.It had been convenient in this peaceful world, as I had earned money using my memory of what had happened in the previous timeline, which I would continue to do. However, past knowledge was not reliable in a dungeon.I needed to acknowledge that I was afraid of being alone in the dungeon, as I dreaded the darkness and my mind was filled with the memories of my past.While so much had passed until this moment, I was still not yet mentally prepared. My lips turned in a bitter smile, as more time would have not solved anything. Going into a dungeon alone with an F class stats meant that my fear was only natural. I had not been able to gather other people or aquire escape insignias and monster alarm insignias.\\nHowever, I was going to the dungeon even though the night sky warned me that this was suicide. I could not delay this until the Trial Tests, which wouldn\u2019t happen for decades, as it meant nullifying the advantages I had gained by going back in time.I had to believe my survival skills and murmured to myself that this was my job as I walked forward.I had designed this building so the dungeon entrance was located on the underground floor, and the half open emergency exit door going down seemed like the maw of some creature.I could only hear my footsteps going down the stairs, and it was then a message popped up.I had not arrived at the dungeon entrance located in the underground storage room and was still on the stairs.[System: Would you like to open the dungeon?]The \u201cExplorer\u201d title I had gained had been activated as it expanded the radius of the area one could activate the System of a dungeon. I did not answer the message and went into the storage room. Only a roughly painted sign said that this was the storage room, and it was an empty space. However, I locked the door first and spoke to the air.\u201cOpen the dungeon.\u201d[System: The dungeon is now Open.]The ground rang, and cracks appeared, and stairs made of dirt appeared below my feet. A pale blue light spread like a barrier where the ground had been, and the stairs rippled like it was underwater.Many a person had been deceived by this fantastic appearance, not knowing that it will lead to their death.I had been about to take a step but quickly stopped myself when I remembered something.\u201cI\u2019m an idiot.\u201dI took out my cell phone and flashlight after turning their power off and placed them on the floor. In dungeons, all electronics and firearms fail to function.***\\nWhile I had made my choice, I still found myself hesitating at the moment I needed to enter. I did not want to go in alone without the necessary items. I clenched my teeth and took a step.[System: You are entering the dungeon.]I felt the stairs amidst the blue light, and I saw a warning message first pop up.[System Warning: You may leave only after satisfying the conditions.]I received my quest notifications.[The quest \u2018Sock and Buskin\u2019 begins.] (EN: The sock and buskin are two ancient symbols of comedy and tragedy.)

The door screeched as I opened it, and I saw the entrance room inside.\\nCharacteristics (2) Skills (2)]\u201cSkill list.\u201d[Odin\u2019s Wrath (Skill) Effect: Enhance with the power of Lightning a target of your choice.Skill Level: F(0)Duration: 30 minutesCool time: 24 hours]With the skill, my sword, which I had made in a workshop for three hundred thousand won, would become a capable weapon. However, due to the duration and cooldown I could not use my skill all the time. I held the sword in one hand and the other empty so I could open doors and had my sword ready for whatever was necessary.However, things were quiet even as the door opened with a screech. I could see about seven meters due to my skill, and if I remembered correctly, the corridors of this dungeon were about fifty meters long. The width was more than fourteen meters, as I could not see the walls, and they were more like roads than corridors.It was then that I saw, sitting by itself, in the middle of the room, apparently undefended, a large chest. Since it looked like a bronze box, in my past life, the newly Awakened had rushed to open it. If that was a real bronze box, I did not need to hesitate. That chest may be real or fake, and if it was real, I would receive something in random, but if not\u2026This was the curse that drove people crazy, sitting before me, as dungeon boxes made me think about opening them despite knowing something bad may happen. You could get something that you would normally need to risk your life for, without a price. This box appearing here and now was one of the tricks the dungeon played on you, to mess with your mind.Of course, something good would pop out only when you were lucky. How many monsters did you need to kill to get a bronze box? I began to calculate, as it was a force of habit. One needs to kill 150 or 300 low-grade monsters to open a bronze box, as you need 300 points to open a bronze box. It was a formidable number.It was then I smelled something faint but disgusting to the nose, and I tightened my grip on my sword. I peered into the darkness with my eyes and I reminded myself that I would be able to only take on a few low-class monsters with my current stats, even in an F class dungeon.I realized again that I had come here when I was too weak, but the only place I could raise my stats was the dungeon for now.I had come here in the past after the Trial Tests, and my average stats and skills were at E class. I was also not alone, as this dungeon needed at least ten people. However, things were different now, and I only had my past memories to support me.I saw three shapes come out of the darkness.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Compared to them, they were the lowest of the low. However, in the dark, alone, the dungeon walls had looked bigger than I remembered, so they looked more intimidating to me.According to the database, they were categorized as KF-07, two-legged beasts, and called Declan Patrol Soldiers. The \u201cofficial\u201d nickname was \u201cGuard Dogs\u201d. Inevitably, those who faced them called them \u201cMutts\u201d. They had the body of adult human males and the heads of Dobermans.I remembered when I had seen them before, and there were incidences of superstitious fear because they looked like Anubis from Egyptian mythology, despite Anubis having the head of a jackal.Anyway, I had not drawn them with defined musculature in my drawing, and their muscles were for running rather than fighting. They were nimble and fast, and the three bolted towards me when they saw me. (EN: Chapter 7.)They were really fast! One was ahead of others and running at me as fast as it could with a mouth already wide open like a shark.I saw a chance, as I would be able to thrust my sword into his mouth. Then, I will be fighting with only two. I looked at the oncoming monster and willed it to die as I raised my sword.***The moment I plunged my blade, dirty blood that came gushing out and splashed on my face. I closed one eye by reflex. The weight on the end of my blade was heavier than I expected, and I felt my right shoulder wrench painfully even as I rolled back after letting go of the blade. I took out my dagger for the shadow that came up in front of me. I had taken it out of the sheath on my thigh, and I had not been late. I had some time as the other one, who should have been following the second, was not there.I pulled back the dagger and grabbed its neck with my other hand. Actually, I was just blocking it from pushing its head towards me. I saw its sharp teeth clack right in front of my face, and his drool flew everywhere as it shook his head.However, I could not plunge the dagger in his neck. I let go of his neck and kicked its stomach, but I was already being pushed back. The moment I kicked one, the other tackled me.\\nMy sight was blocked with its torso, and the monster was not heavy enough to kill me with its weight. My lower body was vulnerable, and I clenched my teeth instead of screaming.I knew that my screams would drive them into a frenzy. I felt a sharp pain in my right leg. It was the one I had tried to use the dagger on, and it was trying to rip off my leg by standing up after clamping its teeth on my leg!I punched the one that had tackled and pushed me down in the crotch and saw that the monster on my leg was doing the exact thing I expected. Our eyes met, and I threw the dagger. The dagger was quicker than stretching and stabbing it in its eye, and I stopped paying attention to how it was screaming and holding its head.I wrestled the one who had rushed me right after I saw the dagger hit the mark, as that one had been going for my neck. I felt its head narrowly miss my neck and touch my ear.Begone! I put my weight on the monster and glanced at the one I had hit with the dagger. It was rolling on the floor and grabbing the dagger handle. I wanted it to try pulling it out of its eye since it would bring it more pain!I heard a scream under me as I turned my gaze at the one I held down, and I used my fist while that sound rang the corridor. I smashed its nose three times until its snout broke and changed positions to strangle its neck with my arms. I gave my arms all of my strength until I was the one grunting at the strain.The one I shoved my sword into its craw and the one with the dagger in its eye could not fight, and this was my chance to reduce the numbers against me.The one under me flailed like a fish, and the power it used to thrash around dragged me along. The monster managed to stand up, and I was stuck on its back with my arms around its neck. While I gave all of my power to pull it down, the monster managed to stand upright.However, I knew that the monster would die soon, and its last chance was when the monster tried to grab my head by reaching out behind with both arms. I felt intense pressure on my head and felt my world spin. That was a bad sign, but the Adversity Overcomer title was not activated yet. It meant that while I was feeling a lot of pain, the situation was not dire enough.It was over in a moment, as the pressure on my head and the monster\u2019s resistance to my strength disappeared in a second. The monster went limp as I heard the loud \u201cCrack!\u201d as I felt the neck give as I wrenched with all my strength, and it went down and remained still when I let it go.\\n[You have beaten the Declan Patrol Soldier.][You have gained two points.][Declan Extermination: Exterminated Declan Soldier 1/60]I breathed in deep and saw the two others that were down.

My body had been moving according to my memories, even when I did not need to look through their intestines to find their magic stones.I took out my hand and wiped it on my pants. I could feel the monster\u2019s blood wet the cloth and remembered that they had red blood just like us.It seemed that the painkiller was working at this point, as my head cleared. I wished over and over again as I walked to the end of the corridor that there was only one monster in the next room. Only one!Ah, but I was not so lucky. I remembered again that one should not go into a dungeon alone as the door opened. I saw them as the door swung open and saw at least five within my field of view.Closing the door carefully wouldn\u2019t do anything to avoid the encounter, as their Night Eyes were far superior to mine, and their eyes shined like cats in the darkness. They were not surprised to see other beings, as they did not know fear. They only knew blood and rage and had been waiting for someone to rip apart.The one that saw me came up sprinting, and the others of the pack were not far behind. Six, seven, eight, nine, and the number was increasing.Trying not to use my skill had been arrogance on my part, as I should have used it from the first room.

When entered into a database, those names were used as an indicator to quantify the skill\u2019s power. While no one knew the mechanisms behind the skill names, it cannot be denied that the divine names in the skill greatly influenced the individual hunter\u2019s confidence, who were all already strong from the start. (EN: They had to be strong enough to acquire these powerful skills.)The closer the hunter was to an S class, the individual would derive their codename from their major skill. The codename of the unofficial sixth of the Eight Virtues, who had been the original owner of this skill, had been Odin. While he may have been flighty in daily life, he was the incarnation of Odin during battles. He had been like a lightning storm itself, and if he had been Odin, I will now let these mutts have a taste of my thunder!***I felt a clean slice, and my swing beheaded the Declan without feeling my sword grinding through the neckbone. I would have effortlessly beheaded this mutt if my strength had been E class, but it seemed that the lightning flowing down my blade was making this possible.This was indeed a skill from a challenger box, and if I could kill the monsters with one shot, I could do this. I waited behind the door I had broken, as this was an advantageous spot. No matter how many monsters there were in front of me, the number of those who could go against me would be limited.The problem was how long my strength will last\u2026[You have beaten the Declan Patrol Soldier.]The message dissipated as another dog\u2019s head shoved in through the doorway, and I saw the monster\u2019s chest where the message window had been. I stabbed the monster, so the blade stuck out of its back and I kicked its corpse away from me, and off my sword.I pierced the third monster\u2019s face, and the mutts may have realized something when they saw three bodies pile up in front of me. Another came jumping in without thought and made the number four, and I kicked away the body with my foot.The monsters were no longer running into my sword, but they were still willing to fight, and the number increased though they maintained a certain distance from the doorway and my sword. I quickly checked the corridor behind me, and if they had raised the alarm, the other door in the first room would open for another herd of monsters to come in from behind, which would mean my death.However, I did not hear anything behind my back, which meant the alarm had not been raised yet. Had a spellcaster who could do such a thing been among this group of Declan Patrol Soldiers? Since I had not gotten the Monster Alarm Insignia, there was no way for me to tell. One good thing was that there should have been only one spellcaster in this group.I was betting my life on that fact, and if I faced another group, and they had a spellcaster\u2026 [email protected] I could only hope that I didn\u2019t get surrounded and ripped apart.\\nThe rest of the mutts were still hanging back and thinking of my limits as an F class, and the duration of my skill, I could not afford to spend more time. I had to either advance or retreat, and I moved a step backward and then another.My leg had not been healed because I was still feeling the pain, and I would drive them into a frenzy if I showed them my back. I saw countless monsters from the open door, and while I had to fight against them, I did not have any healers or tankers. I only had a damage dealer, and that was myself.***While this was only one of the many rooms in the dungeon, my goal had changed from fight to survival. This situation was inevitable since I had to come here alone. However, I had no choice as the world had changed, and I had come of my own volition.Mother [email protected]The monster may have read my anxiety, and one of them jumped towards me even though I had not continued my retreat. Moreover, the monster\u2019s speed was faster than others, and I knew that when I stabbed its chest. I tried to block its darting head with my hand, but it moved its head faster.The monster avoided my hand, and bit my shoulder as hard as it could. My legs shook, and I could not take my sword out. I was lucky I had not let go of it, and the monster pushed in until the sword\u2019s guard slammed against its chest, in its savagery pressing home a suicide attack.[You have beaten the Declan Patrol Soldier.]It finally died, and the head that bit me was tearing into the meat of my shoulder with the weight of its limp body.I stifled a moan as I shoved away the body, as the pain increased because the teeth locked in my flesh were wrenched due to the motion of the dead mutt. I saw other monsters behind the mutt\u2019s shoulders, and if they recognized what was going on, everything was over.If they came in at once, I had no way of attacking or enduring. I counted up to three inwardly and gripped the monster\u2019s head as hard as I could, and twisted with all my strength.I could not hold back a scream as its head snapped back with a chunk of my flesh in its mouth. However, I managed to take out my sword and aimed it at one of the monsters rushing at me as it jumped over the corpses of its fellows.\\nDamn, I got thrown to the ground, as I still was not used to being an F class. I had made a mistake and instinctively held my sword horizontally. Even if the monster tried to twist its body in mid-air, it could not do so due to the speed. The monster pierced itself on my sword, and pinned me under its corpse.[You have beaten the Declan Patrol Soldier.]I did not care about the message anymore, as I already knew that the monster was dead. I could not throw off its body without letting go of my sword, and before I stood up, I threw my dagger at the monsters. Only one fell down, and the rest were through the door. I did not have any time to think or respond.I wanted to run away when I had fallen on the ground, ignoring the unspoken rules of the dungeon and going back the way I had come. However, I did not have an Escape Insignia, and my instincts and intellect gave me different orders.One never got used to this no matter how experienced they were, situations where their survival instinct screamed \u201cFight!\u201d or \u201cFlight!\u201d. Anyone\u2019s hands would shake facing death. However, I had not come here without my final trump card.I gave the one running up to me a chance to kill me and exposed my neck. I wanted it to bite it like it was a lunging shark.\u201cGET OVER HERE!\u201d (EN: ^_^ )***With a crunching sound, I saw a message.[The trait the Man Who Overcome Adversity has been activated.]I did not feel any shock and instead felt quite calm.[Your stamina class has been changed. Change: F -> E.]\\nI killed three at once after standing up. I sliced one in half sideways, used my lowered blade to slice upwards, opening it up from crotch to sternum, and slashed the third with the blade that was now raised up. I vertically sliced the third one, and when the monsters hesitated, I used the time to step back with my eyes on them.They had intellect, especially regarding fights, and the distance from the entrance was wide enough for them to spread out.Some ran to circled me from the back, and I would not let them surround me. My back route would be completely blocked soon, and I could not let them block my line of retreat. Four had gone behind my back, and I could now kill all of them.I was now able to use my sword more fluidly with my strengthened skill level and was able to swing it with a lot more force.Even if my leg was wounded, it moved better than an unawaked uninjured one. That was the difference between an F class and an E class. I killed the four, and others came behind me like moths to a flame.Their heads were now rolling on the floor.[You have beaten the Declan Patrol Soldier.][You have gained two points.][Declan Extermination: Exterminated Declan Soldier 17/60]While Odin\u2019s Wrath lasted for thirty minutes, Adversity Overcomer lasted for five.[Adversity Overcomer time remaining 0 hours 4 minutes 00 seconds][Adversity Overcomer time remaining 0 hours 3 minutes 59 seconds]I could see the message from the corner of my eye and started almost running backward, and I could hear their growls that said they would not let me escape.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If I could, I would have made a break for it. I intentionally lowered my speed in front of the oncoming monster mob and pretended to stumble. It was not difficult to act naturally, as putting weight on my wounded leg was painful and made my balance unstable.I deceived two idiots, and as they came high and fast while screaming, I cut through them both.[You have beaten the Declan Patrol Soldier.]Intestines and blood fell in a torrent and still spilled out, after their corpses were on the ground. One of them was crawling on the floor, leaving behind a bloody trail, since the hit had not been fatal. I stepped on its head as hard as I could. I could hear its skull crunch. My upgraded power allowed me to crush them, and I only had a few steps until the entrance room.It was then I knew how many monsters there were, and only ten of them remained alive. However, going against ten in a frontal attack was suicide, and I opened the door and went in and closed it as quickly as possible. The wooden door shook like it would break, and I pressed my back to the wall parallel to the door, waiting with my sword raised for the first unwelcome guest.[The Man Who Overcame Adversity time remaining 0 hours 2 minutes 59 seconds]I had less than three minutes remaining, and my disadvantages would increase as time passed. However, they could not know this, and as the door was ripped to pieces, one stuck its head in. While I saw only its ear and cheek and not its neck, my sword was already slashing down.I heard a scream, and Odin\u2019s Wrath coupled with my E class power had cut the monster\u2019s head into two. The moment the disgusting corpse which had received an extreme field expedient haircut fell into the room, I kicked it away.At the same time, I moved to where the door had been and thrust my sword into a mutt that had been stupid enough to be within reach. I had consecutively sliced off half of one\u2019s cranium and pierced another. I saw two messages pop up at the same time.[You have beaten the Declan Patrol Soldier.][You have beaten the Declan Patrol Soldier.]I did not hide behind the door and threw myself at them. I could now attack for the first time after entering the dungeon, as I should be able to just handle eight at my present state.***[Declan Extermination: Exterminated Declan Soldier 29/60]\\nI threw off my burdensome backpack, and the message in the air looked like it was sneering at me as I lay down on the floor. To think that an F class hunting quest the System seemed to have given to me as a present was this dangerous.Going solo and passing through the first room was as bad as a boss fight. While my body was heavy, I needed to do some things before the Man Who Overcame Adversity wore off. I shook my backpack, and survival items dropped on the pools of blood the dogs had made.I found the zipper bag dripping with blood, and I took out bandages to treat my leg, shoulder, and stomach. I had a lot to cover.[The Man Who Overcame Adversity time remaining 0 hours 0 minutes 1 second]I was thirsty, but if the effect wore off\u2026[The Man Who Overcame Adversity time remaining 0 hours 0 minutes 0 seconds][The Man Who Overcame Adversity effect will now disappear.]\u201cAh\u2026!!!\u201d***I woke up because I was in pain, thirsty, and hungry. I felt a dog\u2019s head as I reached for a water bottle and remembered that I was in a dungeon. I tried to sit up, but my entire body screamed. I had to support myself with my hands to remain upright.After managing to sit up, I drank water and found a codeine pill lying in a pool of dog blood. I dry swallowed it, sticky with clotted blood. Standing up was a problem, and I could only do so after three tries using my sword like a staff.When I saw the exit I came back to my senses. I instinctively walked and crawled up the stairs, desperate to flee this place, knowing I would die here.I saw that the outside world was also dark. People say fantasy and reality cannot mix together, but they all lied. They co-existed at least here, and the world outside this blue barrier was fantasy and the dungeon was the only reality. The reality had become a nightmare and could only think of getting out.I reached out to the blue barrier.\\n[Warning. You have not satisfied the exit conditions.]I felt my fingers tingle and remembered the fate of those who had ignored the system\u2019s warning as terrible images played out in my head. I flung myself back on the stairs and fainted for quite a long time.\u201c\u2026Traits\u2026list.\u201d[Overcoming Adversity (Trait)Effect: The moment you are incapable of fighting, all stats and skill classes increase by one.

I unrolled the bandage on my leg, and the teeth marks that showed my bone were quite healed. However, my shoulder was another problem, and the wound was deep enough that I felt sporadic pain even with codeine.I came back to the entrance room and started to organize my survival items. I checked whether they were clean and ate an MRE for my hunger. Then, even if I had just risked my life before, I now had free time. I felt the darkness deepen, and while I knew it to be impossible, my sights dim. (EN: Meals Ready to Eat.)***Times like this tended to go two ways. While we could rest up, after an ambush like this, it may be time for another fight. If people had been gathered together without any choice, teammates who had fought together would turn into enemies at the drop of a hat. They may have already suffered from severe PTSD, had been inflicted with a curse before going in, or had received a curse from the dungeon.If mental illness was not a problem, problems happened if someone\u2019s original aim was to kill everyone else in the party for a nice payday, or something went wrong with the contract or someone coveted an enticing item on another teammate.Not only that, but someone may have become angry due to some incident during battle. Anything could happen in a dungeon.\\nEven though I had moved sideways, I still had to cover my face with my hands. I saw the door splinter and the huge log that had crashed through the door spun away after demolishing it. I also felt the wind of the passage of the hunk of wood that would have turned the unwary into meat paste and bone splinters. The sounds the log made hitting the walls rang the air for quite a while.[You have removed a trap.][You have gained 2 points.]I saw a new sentence pop up.[Congratulations.

I was still not well enough to break the door, to absolutely secure my retreat. Now I had another chance to escape, even in case of an ambush.I had another life as long as I could make it to the entrance, and my smile became bitter. The System had always toyed with us, and it always had been like this. The contents of the boxes were truly random, and would either be a blessing or a curse. I had stayed away from the Eight Virtues after realizing that, and even after coming back, getting Overcoming Adversity, and giving Father a Revival Insignia, I still did not believe in the system\u2019s goodwill which the Eight Virtues had advocated.Since I now had an Escape Insignia, I would try to stay near the entrance room as much as possible while doing quests rather than going forward so I could escape if necessary.I understood from the last few days that I could not do the \u201cOne on One Combat\u201d quest until I finished the \u201cDeclan Extermination\u201d quest if I was lucky.I had brought material I could get in this era and was usable in a dungeon. I placed traps in the exit and the entrance room doors and then dropped myself on the floor.If I had just been wasting time before, now I had an exit behind my back. I could check my physical condition and wait until I could fight again. I spent a day in the darkness, and now bandages caked with dried blood littered the floor. Codeine was working now on my shoulder, and I could not feel the pain. While the wound may reopen with large movements, I could fight at this level. I opened the closed door in the entrance room, and while I had thought there were no monsters, a Guard Dog came out of the dark corridor.\u201cYou\u2019re alone?\u201d\\nIf there had been a choice, I would have chosen solitary encounters like this to slowly get used to battle. While these monsters had intellect, their rationality never won against instincts, as the mutts came rushing in even as I smelled of their sibling\u2019s blood.The monster had a blade stuck between its eyes as a price, as I threw my dagger. I had not prepared throwing weapons as I knew I would not be able to see far. I stepped on its shoulder to take out the blade, and the blood came gushing out. The message popped as I kicked its head.[Declan Extermination: Exterminated Declan Soldier 30/60]Half of the Extermination quest remained, and I just needed to do what I have been doing so far.***I stopped walking when I saw a door at the end of the corridor. The second room on the opposite side had twenty plus monsters in my previous life, and while that room may have more, I could not use the Man Who Overcame Adversity now. I could not bring out one at a time, as I would have to fight with all of them if I opened the door.In my past life, unless one wanted to commit suicide, going solo was taboo. We would go into dungeons with at least five and more than ten if possible. We had to train for changes in positions and roles since a single loss meant less chance of survival for all, without compensating our formation for the inevitable casualties.When the military had placed us here, there were only four of us, and we were three attackers and one tanker. The result was obvious, and I had been an E-class at that time. I was one of the many survivors of the Trial Tests thrown into this world and who would do anything to survive.\\nThe situation had gotten worse as time passed, and the dungeon box had been our only hope. Despite the low probabilities, we started fighting among each other to death just for that chance. The winner, obviously as I am here, was\u2026\u201c[email protected]\u201dIt was the darkness nibbling again at my brain. I swept my hair back with some force and moved up to the door. There were no traps, and I only needed to push the door open. That was the only thing left for me to do, but my body was resisting with all its might. A frontal attack was definitely not my style, but I had no choice since I was alone.I opened the door, and the small creak was as eerie as tens of monsters started screaming at me. The room was filled with savage killing instincts, and I could see many heads behind the ones who started running at me.There would be more, not less, than in the rooms I had seen. I hurled my longsword like a spear at the frontrunner and took out my dagger.[You have activated Odin\u2019s Wrath.][Target: Weapon, your dagger]It was that moment.\\nWhen I saw the Entrance, it snarled in rage, and it rushed ahead of the pack with the speed of an E-ranked. I rolled with the monster, and it must have bitten and scratched me quite deeply. I thought of only one thing, and that was the trap at the door should have been activated, to hold back the rest of the mutts.I averted my eyes from behind me and looking only straight ahead, frantically crawling on the floor, holding back my fear and desperation to crawl as fast as I could. Like the day I crawled over the corpses of my fellow guild members to escape from the boss monster, I could not think about my nails being broken.I felt the stairs on my fingers, and time had run out. The speed the howls came seemed quicker, and I thought I had been caught right at the end. Therefore, I had been preparing for my last battle when I realized that there were no more stairs. A new message popped up.[The Insignia \u2018Escape\u2019 has been removed.]I survived! I got out! The screams had disappeared, and it was then I saw the blade stuck in my arm. I grabbed the flashlight I had left at the entrance rather than taking it out.

However, there was a possibility that some may come out of the barrier. If not now, some might come crawling out due to unknown conditions.Everything hurt a lot. Setting up the dungeon containment building as a hospital had been a good choice. While I had lost my backpack in the dungeon, everything I needed was here.There was running water, bandages, painkillers, and a bed. I lay down on the bed while stopping myself from turning on the light. This hospital was currently closed and unoccupied, but if things went like this, the possibility of this building being used for its purpose was zero. (EN: My guess is Sun\u2019s plan after he was finished with the dungeon was to use it to train Awakened that were loyal to him after the Day of Advent.)Unless a tutorial or a lifestyle quest that I had seen after the Trial Tests came up, I could earn points only in dungeons. While there were other F class dungeons in the lands I had bought, discovering and entering them did not mean I would get points and boxes. I had already received the rewards for the First Discovery.I had chosen this place because this was the only F class dungeon in which I knew how to defeat the boss monster. However, I now understood that I could not do this alone. If I had chosen the wrong door, would I have returned? Or would I have managed to find a way? I turned my gaze out the window.Except for the ugly barbed wire topped wall, the village scenery was quite peaceful, and I felt that the wall divided the fantasy from reality like the blue barrier. I picked up my cell phone.I then hesitated a few times before pressing the number. I chose the high risk and high return method, as this was the only way I could retry the dungeon. It was a miracle I had returned and I had almost made my parents sad with my demise.I needed at least a healer, and\u2026***I saw Yeonhee Woo\u2019s car approach the wall as the headlights that wandered around, having lost their way, managed to find the right road. She had not come out even after parking, and when I knocked on her window, she turned around to look at me.She looked terrified, and after I showed her my face with the flashlight, I waited for her to come out.\u201cSunhoo, where is\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s difficult to find.\u201d\\n\u201cI worried, and anyone will when you hang up like that.

Come in.\u201dIt was then Yeonhee Yoo found the hospital plaque, and she remained still. I could understand what she was feeling, and I should have done this before.

Her mother had come to the school, and she had behaved badly. She had shouted to anyone who would hear her how this school employed a mentally ill person as a teacher in front of everyone. I had not seen her since then. Her voice trailed off as soon as she realized what I had said, and then the shouting began.\u201cWhat did you say? I can feel your mind?!\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not crazy. I can explain why you can sense the emotions of other people.

It did not take her long to cry again, and she tried to stop herself from doing so to any avail. So, she spoke with tears flowing down her face.\u201cI can\u2019t stop crying in front of you.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m going to explain the reason why I brought you here. You can cry all you want, but this is about your fate and life, so focus. Are you ready?\u201d\u201cWait, why are you so blunt? I\u2019m the adult here!\u201dI laughed for quite a long time. I tried to be nicer, like when I trained those who were unfortunate enough to Awaken.\u201cYeonhee, the world you belong to does not care about age.\u201dIt only cares about classes.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, when the tests came to an end, there were no heroes. Him, me, and the other survivors had turned into the exact opposite.\u201cI didn\u2019t say that. I said monsters exist, and we could defeat them before their attacks begin one day.\u201d\u201cHow can you be so sure?\u201d\u201cThat they will attack? So, you do believe in monsters?\u201dYeonhee Woo looked at the bandage on my shoulder rather than answering. I had begun recovering, even though a baby\u2019s fist size hunk of my flesh had been torn away, and you could see the white bone. However, it was still an ugly wound, and Yeonhee Woo would have never seen a wound like this before.\u201cCan you show it to me?\u201d \u201cThe wound?\u201d\u201cNo, the monsters.\u201dYeonhee Woo spoke despite a far-off gaze, and she was immersed in the story I was telling. She was placing us in a narrative where the chosen pair will kill monsters and save the world\u2026\u201cThink of this, Yeonhee. You\u2019re surrounded by darkness, and monsters are endlessly creeping out to kill you.\u201dI shook my head at her as she tried to open her mouth, and I covered her eyes with one hand.\u201cYou\u2019re alone and trembling with fear but you\u2019re desperately trying to survive. So, your hand touches a monster when you try to feel your way out, and you shriek and open your eyes wide. It hurts worse than the most painful memory you have, and that was when you met the monster\u2019s yellow eyes that are shining in the dark, chewing on your hand.\u201dShe may have imagined the scene too well or perhaps she was feeling the fear from me as I described my memory. Anyway, her body was shaking.\\n\u201cThen, you see other monsters in the dark you have forgotten about. They have surrounded you and are charging to you. While you see only a few, you know that there are many others that you cannot see. You try to shout but cannot do so because a monster bit through your throat. You cannot see what comes next because you\u2019re busy drowning in your own blood as you die.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHowever, you know what will come. Monsters will violate your corpse, and some may rip off your limbs to run off into a dark corner to gnaw on your arms or legs, while some will fight over your bloody intestines that one of them ripped out of your stomach.\u201dI took my hand off Yeonhee Woo\u2019s eyes.\u201cOpen your eyes.\u201dShe followed my command, and she looked as frightened as she had been when she first came here.\u201cNo matter what terrors you thought of, things are worse. Do you think that you\u2019re still in a fantasy film?\u201dI leaned over toward her to get the message through as she stood still, trembling.\u201cThis is a horror film.\u201d***Yeonhee Woo\u2019s emotions were rubbed raw, as Unawakened could immerse themselves deeply in their imagination. Awakened had no need to imagine horrors. She acted like she had been dropped into the terror I had described, and she shuddered for a while with a pale face. She looked at me like a three-year-old child who had lost her way.\u201cBut you mean\u2026that we have to do this, right?\u201d\u201cYou have to choose.\u201d\u201c\u2026I guess I have to.\u201d\\n\u201cYes. Either start preparing with me or forget about everything and be killed leading an isolated life.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by that?\u201d\u201cWhile monsters may not attack for a while, that day is coming. You can be prepared or not. In fact, without my interference, you would not have been able to survive until that day. You cannot say you would have endured your family\u2019s gaze, the society\u2019s gaze, and how you see yourself. Until you came here, you were a madwoman who could not stand up to your mother.\u201d\u201cHey.\u201d\u201cJust listen. I gave you a reason to live, something that\u2019s just as valuable as a reward from a challenger box. You won\u2019t commit suicide and you will live on until monsters come. Won\u2019t you?\u201dYeonhee Woo remained quiet.\u201cI don\u2019t care if you decide to become the heroine of a horror film, but if you don\u2019t, I\u2019m telling you that you can live quietly until the day the monsters come. And drag you out from under your bed, screaming.\u201dI leaned against the bench after I finished talking.\u201cYou\u2019re lying.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d \u201cAbout not caring. You need me not as your teacher but as one of you.\u201dYeonhee Woo was hesitant but certain.\u201cThat\u2019s right. However, I\u2019ll find a way to win in the dungeon without you. So, you don\u2019t have to take on that burden since this is about your life.\u201dI was sincere. While I did need her for another try, I would not drag her in by her hair. I stood up.\\n\u201cHis fear was so much more intense\u2026\u201dYeonhee hugged herself with both arms but could not help shaking. She thought of Sunhoo again. She had known that he was an inexplicable person for a long time, as he was more mature in both mind and soul than any adult. However, to think that he would harbor such fear. Yeonhee was more shocked at that emotion compared to what Sunhoo had explained about himself.\u201cMonsters, dungeons\u2026\u201dYeonhee could not remain in the car, and she sat down on the bench in front of the crowded area in front of the restrooms and tried to focus on the music coming from the speakers. However, she found the usual sights of parents buying food for kids, men smoking or stretching, or young couples walking by suddenly strange. (EN: Generally, rest stops in Korea feature a large cafeteria space with tables and chairs to eat food from one of multiple fast options. There is a convenience store and large bathrooms. There are also a few coffee shops too, but that\u2019s about it and that\u2019s pretty standard.)\u201cStatus window.\u201dYeonhee mumbled.[Name: Yeonhee WooMental Strength: F(12)Accumulated points: 50Traits(1) Skill(1)]She had thought this only an illusion a few hours back, but now seeing it calmed her down. Yeonhee wiped the tears that had come on again and went back to her car. She then remembered the documents Sunhoo had given her, and they had been two different contracts. However, they included words that she had not seen before, like cooperation, betrayal, points, and dungeon boxes. The one she was most familiar with was the death compensation fee, and it was written in the second contract.[Your designated beneficiary will receive three billion won immediately if you die in a dungeon.]She realized that the world would not recognize this contract, as anyone would laugh after reading it. However, Yeonhee\u2019s face was serious as she thought back at the barren mountain, the new hospital, and Sunhoo, who seemed to own the place.\u201cBeing alone like that\u2026\u201dYeonhee bit her lips at the thought.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She had initially resisted going back home, but after the second day, I thought she changed her mind after going home, and declined my offer. The contents of the contract would make anyone think twice, from the death compensation and the penalties for contractual violations. The contracts I had given her were the same as those that guilds had given to new hunters before.However, I saw her car coming up to the wall.\u201cI thought you would welcome me.\u201dShe was smiling.\u201cCome in.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s better at daylight. This place seems to be haunted at night.\u201d\u201cIf you came here because of meaningless words like destiny and fate\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, I came here because of this.\u201dYeonhee Woo took out the contract envelope.\u201c\u2026I cannot be responsible for your life. Coming with me into a dungeon could mean death. What we would be doing is incredibly dangerous.\u201d I read out loud the sections she had highlighted.\u201cI brought fried chicken since I didn\u2019t know what you like. Do you like fried chicken?\u201d\u201cStop trying to change the subject.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m grateful since you were right. I had been only thinking about how I could end my life with less pain before you called me.\u201dHowever, her face was not that of a suicidal person, and her expression was actually bright.\u201cWon\u2019t you let me in?\u201dShe hadn\u2019t just brought only food and the envelope. Her trunk was filled with her supplies and other items.\u201cI thought you would not need medicine, so I brought you clothes.\u201dShe had brought me clothes, lotions, and innerwear. Since she brought everything for adult males, it seemed that she decided to treat me as one. She spoke quickly as I stared at her.\u201cI\u2019m sorry, I\u2019ll be back. Call me when you\u2019re done.\u201dShe went out and came back.\u201cI thought they would suit you.\u201d \u201cGetting these didn\u2019t take two days, right?\u201d\u201cI read the contracts you gave me on the way back that day. I thought about returning immediately, but this was about my life.\u201d\\n\u201cYou understood the contract?\u201d\u201cI read it countless times, and saw that I was betting my life on insignias and items.\u201d\u201cYour decision?\u201d\u201cI chose this.\u201dYeonhee Woo had signed the contract and specified money instead of items and insignias, and it was a realistic choice. She would get two hundred million won as a contract signing fee, an annual payroll of a billion won, and an incentive of five hundred million per dungeon entry, and another five hundred million for survival. Her death compensation would be three billion won. (EN: 200,000,000 won = $321,599. 1,000,000,000 won = $1,607,997. 500,000,000 won = $803,998. All conversions are in 1997 won, and 2021 dollars. ^_^ )I calculated what new hunters earned to this era\u2019s currency, and while this contact would have been given only for E class awakened, who could legitimately be called hunters, I gave her more for her rarity.\u201cWho\u2019s your beneficiary?\u201d \u201cMy father.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean? Don\u2019t you want your contract signing fee?\u201dI was surprised at Yeonhee Woo not showing the reaction I expected, and she seemed to be more conscious of the cash I got out of the bank. She seemed to be on the lookout, and I put the bags of money in the trunk and got in the car.Her expression was rigid, and I stopped her from hitting the accel the moment I got in the car.\u201cRelax. Why, do you think this is black money?\u201dTwo hundred million won in 1998 was a lot of money and could buy an apartment in Gangnam easily. Yeonhee looked like she was thinking of something.\u201cThis money is not illicit, but don\u2019t put it into your bank at once. Tax reports can be difficult, open a safe deposit box. Let\u2019s go to Gangnam and not a hospital.\u201dShe seemed small and timid, but she drove fast and fiercely. It seemed to be out of desperation rather than skill. I thought I may die on the road and not in a dungeon.\u201cGo slower.\u201d\u201cWhere are we going?\u201d\u201cMy office.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dYeonhee Woo slowed down as I asked.\u201cYou should be full of questions, but you\u2019re quieter than you had been at school.\u201d\\n\u201cThink what you wish.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re waiting for me to speak? That\u2019s nice.\u201d\u201cI did not sign that contract lightly. I received\u2026money.\u201d\u201cYes, well. You win. I\u2019ll tell you who I am. Hey, watch the speed.\u201d As silly as it sounds, in this situation, the source of my funding was what weighed heaviest in her mind.\u201cSorry.\u201d\u201cWhen did you first get your powers?\u201d \u201cDuring middle school.\u201dYeonhee Woo added on after a beat.\u201cAfter my first period.\u201d\u201cIt was like this for me since birth, and I have been doing this for a long time.\u201dIt was then Yeonhee Woo looked at me with wide eyes. I pointed upfront rather than saying anything until we were safe again.\u201cWhy did you choose money? What are you thinking? I don\u2019t think you would want to leave money for your family if you die.\u201dHer family relations were likely beyond repair.\u201cAn Escape Insignia does not come easily. You won\u2019t have one, according to your contract if you become my employee.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t throw me away, right?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cThen, it\u2019s all right. You\u2019re my teacher now.\u201d***\u201cYou hadn\u2019t had any trouble, right?\u201d As usual, I asked the guard if everything was ok.\u201cWhat happened to your shoulder?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on a trip since business is not good. Thank you for asking.\u201d Obviously I ignored his question , and implied I got injured while playing, like skiing.We waited for the elevator after I greeted the young guard, and I saw Yeonhee Woo watch me through the elevator mirror. Her face had been rigid until now, and our eyes met through the mirror. She spoke like she could not help it.\u201cWhat do you mean by since birth? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\\n\u201cI won\u2019t like this, but you will have to prepare me.\u201dYeonhee Woo replied. If her physical strength was strong, it would have been all right. However, she looked too frail, and her determined face was a bit cute.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to fight them, and you shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\u201cOh?\u201d\u201cEverything\u2019s over if it comes to that, as either I\u2019m dead or you have to face the monsters yourself. However, I need to prepare you enough that you can shoot arrows, even if I did not scout you to do so.\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat did you expect? I\u2019m not going to train you as a warrior.\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s expression suddenly loosened.\u201cMy ability is empathic healing, right?\u201dShe was right for once.\u201cSo, let\u2019s see if you\u2019re going to be just a healer or can become MORE.\u201dI had been waiting for this. I had gotten a challenger box when I was first awakened and when I first discovered a dungeon. What if I created a party for the first time?[You invited Yeonhee Woo to the party.]I accessed the System and sent the invite, and Yeonhee Woo also looked at the air. She would have received the message.\u201cRepeat after me. Accept.\u201dShe did so carefully.[Yeonhee Woo has joined your party.][Congratulations. You have formed a party for the first time.]First! I loved that word and almost screamed. I stared at the air.[You have received a \u2018bronze box\u2019 as your first-time reward.]I received just a bronze box, but I could accept that. I was grateful for getting one since forming a party was not that much of a risk. However, maybe having Yeonhee Woo join my party was considered a risk.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His luck had been amazing and therefore he had been reckless. He had become famous for that, which was his misfortune and led to a fatal mistake, trusting his luck too much.Anyway, his luck had been on another level from us, and we had always felt there was a hidden status for luck. We had been most surprised when he had consecutively gotten higher rewards than the box\u2019s class.***[You have received the Insignia \u2018Speed-up.\u2019]The Speed-up Insignia raised my agility to a higher tier, and for me, if I used the Man Who Overcame Adversity, I would be able to raise the stat up all the way from Tier F to Tier D. I could dodge and evade quicker and attack more ferociously, and that was enough for me. However, the insignia class and the number of uses were beyond my expectations.[Speed-up (Insignia)Effect: This insignia raises the user\u2019s agility class by one.Class: EUse Time: 30 minutesNumber of use: Three times]It was an E class insignia that should have come out of silver boxes, and I could use it three times! I remembered that poor lucky guy, and I thought that maybe his luck had come to me when I got the chance to come back in time.As a result, I was getting the first-time titles that the First Evil or the First Virtue had, and I had gotten an Escape Insignia before. Now, I received an even higher reward!\u201cI also got a box.\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s voice came through, and she was smiling with her eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s a skill. \u2018Physical Healing.\u2019\u201dI may have hugged her despite myself because I had thought that the goddess of luck was really smiling down on me. I was excited and took pain to calm myself down, not to show it in front of her. My face was almost as flushed as she had been. (EN: Yes, Sun hugged her. He\u2019s usually so controlled, he was embarrassed, and tried to pass it off. ^_^ )She may have been swept away by my emotions, and this was why in my previous life we took pain to distance ourselves from hunters like her. Hunters with mental skills had made us feel naked, and those who had malicious intentions\u2026I returned to the office, and Yeonhee Woo was staring at nothing. However, her gaze was straight, and she must have been confirming the skill effect.\u201cYou have become closer to a healer.\u201d\u201cAren\u2019t I an empathic healer?\u201d\\nYeonhee Woo asked with a smile.\u201cYour skills are not limited to that. You may get healing skills, mostly mental skills, due to your original trait. You may get attack skills if you\u2019re lucky.\u201dIt would be lucky for both of us, as her having an attack skill, particularly a ranged one, would be a good thing. I then terminated my experiment, having gotten a more than successful result.[You have canceled the party.]I then took off the bandage wrapped on my shoulder, and she wasn\u2019t so dense as to fail to understand why I showed her my wound. She tried to use her skill for a while, and then her face was filled with surprise.A message popped up in front of me.[Your wound has healed by a little.]An F class skill would not bring amazing effect or regenerative skills, but she was doing everything for the first time. She had used her new skill intentionally and had succeeded in using the skill.\u201cYou\u2019re doing well.\u201dI remembered the days when I taught the traumatized newly Awakened with some hope. It was then the intercom rang.***\u201cShould I go?\u201dYeonhee Woo had already finished preparations to leave.\u201cStay.\u201dI heard the office door being knocked, and I saw a flushed face when I opened it. He was a foreigner wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses and seemed to be touring Seoul.\u201cYou were here. Why\u2026!\u201d\\nJonathan stopped raising his voice and looked at my wounds in disbelief and shock.\u201cYou said that nothing was wrong, but what\u2019s with all these wounds?

You should have told me if you were this hurt\u2026who is this?\u201d\u201cYou saw.\u201dJonathan saw Yeonhee Woo, and she was standing rigid like she was the last survivor of a slaughtered party in a dungeon. She seemed to be shocked at Jonathan, as she knew who he was. I remembered that she had tried to explain IMF to us, and Jonathan had removed his sunglasses to check my wounds.\u201cThis is\u2026my middle school homeroom teacher.\u201dI identified her, and she stared at Jonathan as if he was a Hollywood star.\u201cI don\u2019t need to introduce him because you know who he is, right?\u201dYeonhee Woo had been about to lower her gaze when Jonathan put out a hand towards her.\u201cI did not know that Sun\u2019s homeroom teacher was such a lovely person.\u201dJonathan was speaking in English, and she seemed to have not understood the entire sentence. As she did not teach English, her skills should have rusted over time. Yeonhee Woo looked flabbergasted as she shook hands with Jonathan. I took out a piece of paper.\u201cWrite your beneficiary\u2019s name, Resident Registration Number, and address. It\u2019s better in English but write in Korean if you can\u2019t.\u201d\u201cNow?\u201d\u201cDo it.\u201dYeonhee Woo filled the paper standing up, and I handed it to Jonathan. He asked an obvious question.\\n\u201cOur contract will be executed by Jonathan. You know who he really is?\u201d\u201cI know who he is and that you must be living an amazing life.\u201d\u201cSo, now you know you can trust me for the monetary compensations and the benefits you\u2019ve signed for in your contract.\u201dI sent her away after she nodded and arranged that we will meet at the office tomorrow morning.I opened the door where my uninvited guest was, and he was staring at the memo Yeonhee Woo had written. He turned his gaze to me.\u201cWhy do I have to give him three billion won? What\u2019s with the supposition that you will go missing? Writing that will was not sudden. What\u2019s going on with you?\u201d\u201cEverything\u2019s a mystery with me, right?\u201d\u201cSun!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t ask. We all have our secrets.

Come to New York with me. I never liked your country in the first place.\u201dShould I tell him? However, I remembered that we still had twenty years to go, and I sat in front of him and spoke sincerely.\u201cPlease don\u2019t ask. I\u2019ll tell you if you want but remember that I really don\u2019t want to.\u201dJonathan rumbled his hair and spoke in annoyance.\u201cThat\u2019s unfair.\u201dJonathan picked up his pack, and I thought he would go out, but he took out a book. It was titled Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained, and I saw Jonathan\u2019s face on the cover.\u201cDo you like the title?\u201dEdited by Userunfriendly(EN: Yeah, it seemed a bit rushed to me too.

As I had won over Jonathan, a specialist in the field, the public would fall for this. The entire book was a masterful piece of misdirection. Just like how a stage magician diverted the attention of the audience away from the actual trick, I used knowledge of financial theories not yet published, analysis using economic models not yet created, to provide an extensive, exhaustive and completely plausible explanation of our success. All this was designed to hide the real trick.

How can I evaluate the group account manager of the Morgan Group? I was comparing him to you. I then learned that he had contributed a lot to the Morgan Group\u2019s system. You knew that?\u201d\u201cI told you Jillian will manage our private finances.\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d\\n\u201cSo, Jonathan. Focus with Jeffrey Kay buying investment companies and place your less competent friends in sales. Go work with the best in Wall Street.\u201d\u201cAbout that\u2026 The elites have nothing to learn under me. I have to learn from them.\u201d\u201cThey all are looking to go on their own and they don\u2019t want to learn anything from you. They want seed money and fame, and after getting government approval, the fame is coming to us.\u201d They\u2019re coveting our fame, and would use us if we let them.\u201cSun, you are\u2026\u201dJonathan looked at me.\u201cYou are clearly in danger. Use what you need from me, and I\u2019ll take care of the rest.\u201dI agreed, as I was still terrified of going back into the dungeon.\u201cI apologize for belittling your friends, as we only looked at loyalty as I specified.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t need to. I refused to let them manage our funds. They are where they belong, but don\u2019t worry about them because they are loyal and grateful to us.\u201d***Someone else may recognize Jonathan, so we ordered in. However, the place Jonathan remembered from before seemed to have closed due to the foreign firms leaving this building, who had been their previous customers. It was a common enough story.\u201cThis place is not good.\u201dJonathan lowered his spoon.\u201cYou said you did not like this country?\u201d\u201cI was speaking rashly.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cWhat I meant was that the Korean people sacrificed so much for this country after the IMF, because the government had placed them in such a drastic situation. Nothing else.\u201dJonathan mentioned the Gold Collection Campaign, which had gathered 200 tons in total. He had even seen housewives bringing their gold wedding rings, and while the gold had helped Korea, there had been those who had filled their pockets. I did not mention that since he would again tell me to come to New York.\\n\u201cHave you thought about it?\u201dI turned to the computer, and Jonathan answered while he followed me.\u201cAbout what?\u201d\u201cWhere the foreign funds came from, that had come not only to Korea but to Asia.\u201dJonathan took a seat next to me, and he looked at the websites I opened with interest. Stocks in Eastern Europe and Latin America were thriving.\u201cAre those our next investments?\u201dJonathan asked but answered himself.\u201cAren\u2019t we too late?\u201dHe was accurate, as even though we had several opportunities, we had kept quiet as we hid or laundered the money we had earned in Hong Kong. Europe and Latin America would be only appetizers, and the main dish was somewhere else.\u201cThe money used to burn Asia and the money that came from the people taken by surprise and got taken to the cleaners are going to Eastern Europe and Latin America right now.\u201dI spoke as I pointed at the screen, and Jonathan looked like he was anticipating what magic I would use next. I spoke on.\u201cThere is another place, Russia.\u201dJonathan turned on another computer, and he started chasing my hint. He looked at several reports from the Russian Finance Bureau and several other Russian financial institutions. It was then Jonathan came to an inevitable conclusion. Like those who had been deceived by my book, global financiers were being deceived by Russian data.Worst of all, the Russian government itself also believed in their own data, and Jonathan spoke like he was trying to oppose his conclusion.\u201cDo you know how many nuclear weapons Russia has? They must not go down.\u201dJonathan was accurate and to the point. That was how people generally saw Russia, as a holdover bogeyman from the Cold War. I moved up to see Jonathan\u2019s monitor and confirmed the reports he had read. I found what I wanted and took my hand off the mouse. I spoke as I straightened my back.\u201cThe short-term interest rate rose to 40%. That\u2019s a symptom.\u201d\u201cThe market thinks differently.\u201d\\n \u201cYou really think that Russia will go down!\u201d Jonathan finally realized we had gone from speculation and theories into risking our money.Betting on things is easy, but there was a massive amount of work to be done by qualified professionals to exploit the situation and walk away with the pot.Jillian, who was in the Isle of Man, would be waiting for the proposal to come.***To Jillian, the Isle of Man was not really home, as he was born in north London. Since the island was administratively independent, it was ambiguous whether he was back in the country of his birth. However, they shared the Irish Sea and the same Queen. Jillian went to his favored pub. Foreigners who had come to a place like this normally did not venture out of their hotels or offices, and Jillian stopped going to his hotel\u2019s bar after discovering this pub.The place reminded him of his student days, as there was always an EPL game on, and men would watch to get angry despite the games being reruns. (EN: The Premier League, often referred to outside the UK as the English Premier League, or sometimes the EPL, is the top level of the English football league system. )He would come here alone without other employees, as he considered soccer holy. However\u2026\u201cJessica? What are you doing here?\u201d\u201cI followed the noise.\u201dJessica looked at the television, and Jillian was surprised. He could have been anywhere, but Jessica had followed him just by the sounds of Manchester United thrashing the Arsenal. She was smart and could have succeeded anywhere. Therefore, he believed she would be even more of a star in the financial world, and that was why she was entrusted with access to his business email account.It was then Jillian realized that something was different about her, and she looked flushed despite always being calm.\u201cHas the investment proposal arrived?\u201dJessica spoke with excitement.\u201cI don\u2019t want to use the word genius easily, but they really are!\u201dEdited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 56: Past Life Returner Chapter 56 \\nChapter 56\\nJillian had been too excited to sleep, and he grabbed his phone as he sat up in bed. The call was picked up immediately\u2026(EN: The Assistant Secretary for International Finance supports the Treasury\u2019s work on international monetary policy, coordination with the G-7 and G-20, technical assistance, and regional and bilateral economic issues.)Jessica immediately replied with an excited voice, and while Jillian had been surprised at her forethought, he was even more surprised at the investment proposal\u2019s estimations and originality.Jessica came to Jillian\u2019s room later in the night because neither one could sleep, so they might as well work. She came in bringing a bundle of documents and organized them on a table.\u201cThe amazing thing about this proposal is that it\u2019s not only about the numbers.\u201d\u201cYes! It predicts the behaviors of the major players too.\u201dJessica was still talking about Moscow, though not the schedule, as that could be checked by a simple phone call.\u201cThe proposal predicts that the Deputy Under Secretary\u2019s request for a meeting will be blocked by the Russian Prime Minister\u2019s chief secretary.\u201d\u201cYes, that secretary doesn\u2019t understand the new Russia and still lives in the Cold War. He will think that it is an insult for the Prime Minister to meet a mere Deputy Under Secretary, even though he was sent based purely on his expertise. I agree wholeheartedly with the prediction.\u201dJessica then handed Jillian a few documents, and they were still a bit warm from the printer. Jillian did not need to tell her anything, as she prepared what he wanted without saying.\u2018A person like this was managing a Call Center just because she was a woman. Wall Street is obsolete and deserves to be ousted by an Enfant Terrible like Jonathan.\u2019 (EN: Enfant Terrible is a French expression, traditionally referring to a child who is terrifyingly candid by saying embarrassing things to parents or others)Jillian turned his gaze at the documents, which had summarized the personal history of the Chief Secretary of the Russian Prime Minister, specifically it was a record of past actions in which he allowed his personal opinions and prejudices to override his objectivity, which was a part of his duties. Jessica found multiple evidence for what the proposal predicted in just a few lines.\u201cIf the Deputy Under Secretary\u2019s request is refused, it will make quite a ripple.\u201dAmerica had been the World\u2019s Police in International Economics, sometimes even directly controlling the economy of entire nation-states. For example, Japan after World War 2. This had been due to their status as the strongest Superpower. However, the power mechanism had changed, as America realized that financial control was better than military firepower and became stronger thanks to capitalism.If Russia refused this meeting\u2026Jillian could not take his eyes off of the investment proposal and Jessica\u2019s supplementary documents. She spoke.\\n\u201cIf we take a short position for the ruble and the proposal\u2019s predictions are accurate\u2026\u201d (EN: A short position refers to a trading technique in which an investor sells a security with plans to buy it later. Shorting is a strategy used when an investor anticipates the price of a security will fall in the short term.)\u201cWhat if the predictions are wrong? Do you want to risk everything on a single Russian\u2019s behavior patterns? The proposal clearly states that it is only a supplementary prediction and focuses on trends further in the future.\u201d\u201cHowever, the ripple effect will be too large. The proposal is talking about the possibility of the IMF refusing to bail out Russia.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see the other documents.\u201dJillian continued to speak calmly like a schoolteacher, and it was then Jessica suddenly changed the subject.\u201cHave you read it?\u201dJillian obviously knew what it was, as everyone, even those not involved in finance, was interested in his book. A newbie had made tens of billions from forty thousand dollars in half a year! It was a record-breaking event that defied imagination, and made one question one\u2019s belief in a sane and orderly Universe.\u201cJonathan?\u201d\u201cYes, I remember a memorable sentence. \u2018Now is the time to see the people and not the numbers. The numbers may fluctuate from policy, but people don\u2019t change their way of thinking, their prejudices and their opinions. I focused on the fact that policies moved numbers and people moved policies.\u201d\u201cYou memorized that already? I did not know that you were such a fan.\u201d\u201cI saw him quite often, and he always seemed down when he came to the stock exchange. You haven\u2019t met him since you were stuck in Morgan?\u201d \u201cPeople can\u2019t be judged by their cover.\u201dJessica smiled meaningfully at Jillian, and he waved his hands.\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about Jonathan. We\u2019re both jealous.\u201d\u2018It\u2019s not that.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re saying that it fits this situation, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cJessica.\u201d\\n\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cThere are many investment methods in this world, and Jonathan found the way that best suits him. You said that he had always seemed down, right? People only see the success and not the failures. You saw how many times he failed until he found his own method.\u201d\u201cYou said that you had never experienced failure.\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t, but I made a mistake I should have not made.\u201dHe should not have gone to Morgan and New York. If not, Jillian would not have been stuck on this small island. He felt a bitter taste in his mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t revere him. His success story makes me dream. I\u2019ll find my own method, so can we move on?\u201dJillian and Jessica spent the rest of the night on the investment proposal, and he felt like he was back in his student days when he would passionately debate over an assignment.Therefore, he did not feel tired even when dawn came, and some more time passed. While Jillian had said to Jessica that she should not believe in another\u2019s success story, he surrendered at about nine o\u2019clock in the morning. He had wanted to find a crack in the proposal, but it was perfect. Every piece of evidence in the proposal, from the numbers to players, fit like clockwork to prove the premise that Russia would go bankrupt.\u201c\u2026Russia will go down, and I want to meet the team that made this proposal.\u201dJillian was seriously sincere.\u201cThere will be many like you.\u201dHe did not say that he was one of them and smiled. Jillian sent Jessica back and got ready to go to work. He washed from top to bottom thoroughly. He was planning to not come out of his office for a while and eat and sleep there. The proposal was perfect, and now he needed to think about making the most profit based on it.He had received good money to do just that. He left his room with a bundle of underwear and left behind his cell phone like a hunter going into a dungeon.***\u201cA dungeon?\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s eyes widened. She had not imagined she would be going into one today. I spoke as I lay back in the passenger seat as much as I could.\u201cGo to Jeollabuk-do, Gimje.\u201d (EN: Gimje is a city in North Jeolla Province, South Korea. North Jeolla Province is in Korean, Jeollabuk-do)She seemed to be thinking about why we had to go there and not Hwasung and said that there would be a map in the glove compartment in front of me. I heard the car start as I closed my eyes after I gave it to her. (EN: Hwasung is the site of the dungeon with the mental health facility built to contain it.)\\nWe were at the base of a hill, and she got out of the car after me. I saw that she now realized what she was going into as I took out the same backpack and sleeping bag I had lost in the dungeon. I heard her rough breathing quicken.\u201cTurn around.\u201dOnly she would wear a backpack, and I could not see her face after adjusting the length and tied on the rolled sleeping bag on the loops attached to the bottom. I could only see her legs below the bag, and she could not remain still under the weight.\u201cAlmost anything you need is in the backpack, and there are also better knives you can use than the ones you had seen in the rest area.\u201dIt was then when Yeonhee Woo realized what was going on, and her voice burst out in surprise.\u201cI\u2019m a healer! You\u2019re not saying that I have to go alone, right?\u201d\u201cDo you know where the dungeon is?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSo, go and find it. The method is simple. Cover as much ground as you can until the system notifies you.\u201dI grabbed her shoulders as I needed to emphasize this as much as I could.\u201cYou have to come back right after finding the dungeon and not open it. Contact me then. If you open it out of curiosity, you\u2019re not the only one who will die.\u201d\u201c\u2026What will happen?\u201d\u201cMonsters will come out, and things that no army can handle will jump out to kill people.\u201dOf course, it will not happen. The dungeon closes again after the first person to enter dies in the dungeon. I had placed walls to not only block people from entering but in case someone escaped from the dungeon. I glared at her as I warned her again.\u201cRemember not to open it. Carve that into your mind.\u201dEdited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Could she find it? Finding the dungeon access point that was the size of someone\u2019s foot would need perseverance and serious luck. If she succeeded, she would become the second person to find a dungeon after me. That had been the main reason I sent her alone, but if she did not give up easily, that would be satisfactory. She needed to become used to the darkness, and this would be the most appropriate place to test her will and limits. A night in the hill was dark and seriously scary.***The day I received the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s approval to buy the fund division of ANC and Blue Rock was also the day the people had enough, and started to finally demand that someone take responsibility for the Korean Financial Crisis. All sorts of hearing were coming out, and I had to go to Gangnam right after school because Father had asked me to come.He had said that he felt a lot of affection for Jeonil Investments because they shared the same name, and he called me there. I wore my cap deeply, as I would not meet the busy Jamie but I would meet those who had come to my office building, where my father worked. This was the first time I visited the head office. (EN: Yep, Sun named his company after his dad. ^_^ )The large, expensive logo on the entrance identified Jeonil\u2019s corporate headquarters. There were not many visitors since civilians had no need to visit. However, the few guests seemed like major players from the Blue House or in the finance field. Therefore, the overall atmosphere was serious, solemn like at a church, and the lobby receptionist asked me about my purpose. She would see me as an ordinary university student.\u201cI came to visit my father, and his name is Jeonil Na.\u201d\u201cPlease wait in the VIP Lounge over there.\u201dHer smile said that she was surprised at my age. I looked at the lobby as I waited for Father, and a group of people came out from the elevator. I knew who the center was, as while the current Minister of Economy and Finance was with the group, people were walking at the pace of a middle-aged man who wore a Jeonil badge.I recognized that he was one of the two Korean directors in Jeonil, and whichever one he was, he had contributed much to place Jeonil in the center of power in the Korean way.I looked at them with curiosity when Father arrived.\u201cYour timing is nice. Do you know who they are?\u201dFather went on speaking like he did not expect me to answer.\u201cHe is the Director of my company, and the Minister of Economy and Finance is with him with his subordinates. Do you know about the position?\u201d\u201cYes, Father.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think about seeing them from afar?\u201d\\n\u201cI think that they are human beings. Things seem unreal in monitors.\u201dI did not know the answer Father wanted, but he smiled satisfactorily.\u201cYou do watch the news. I thought you were only interested in sports. Did you eat lunch?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cWait for a minute here.\u201dFather spoke as he looked at the lobby window where the car belonging to the Minister was parked, and he quickly went out. I could see him bow to the Minister, and the older man tapped Father\u2019s shoulder and shook hands with the Director before going inside the car.Father then came towards me with the Korean Director, and I thought that Father was trusted in the way the two men walked. I stopped myself from going somewhere else, as even though I would prefer to not meet him, to disappear would embarrass my father.After taking off my baseball cap, I stood like a military officer and bowed after waiting for them to come in. I politely greeted them and saw Father\u2019s fleeting smile.\u201cHe\u2019s a handsome son. What university does he go to?\u201dThe Director asked me, and Father answered.\u201cHe\u2019s still a middle-school student.\u201dThe Director looked at me with surprise before speaking.\u201cWell! You have nothing to worry about since your son is healthy, trustworthy, and polite. You\u2019re a middle-school student?\u201d\u201cI go to Sinwoong.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s my middle school!\u201d\\nFather opened his eyes wide at the news, and the Director gave me ten ten-thousand won bills. (EN: $150 in today\u2019s dollars)\u201cI\u2019m giving you this so you can become a good man like your father.\u201dI was the one who wanted to give him money and tell him to keep up the good work.***Father looked happy.\u201cWeren\u2019t you surprised at me saying to come here?\u201dWe were walking along the main road.\u201cI have something to tell you and something to do. I wanted to show you the company I worked at before I am reassigned.\u201d\u201cYou are reassigned?\u201dI was truly surprised.\u201cI\u2019m not fired. I was promoted two ranks higher and did not tell your mother this yet. I\u2019m planning to surprise her today.\u201d\u201cWhere?\u201d \u201cWe are going there now.\u201dI first thought of Daehoo, as the waiting period was now over. Daehoo was being reorganized now, and Father had been a bank teller. If he was reassigned to Daehoo, he would be going to Daehoo Securities, which will be incorporated into the future Naeil Finance Group.\u201cHow was your trip? I only heard a few things from your mother since I was busy.\u201d\\n\u201cWhile she\u2019s not wrong, that\u2019s why it\u2019s sad. You may not understand what I\u2019m saying, but when you do, tell me so. Then, we could have a drink together.\u201dFather nodded to the head office of the Korean Exchange Bank in front of us.\u201cI\u2019m working there from tomorrow. Does the building look good?\u201dI also looked at the building, and I had not heard that the Korean Exchange Bank had been bought by Jeonil Investments. Originally, an American firm would go in as the largest shareholder in the Korean Exchange Bank, and people would start to talk.This was due to the Credit Card Crisis of 2003, after the financial group that owned the Korean Exchange Bank overextended itself after buying Daehyun Investments and Securities.\u201cThe Korean Exchange Bank is your company\u2019s? I did not know that.\u201d\u201cYou knew about the place I work at? You still surprise me despite being my son.\u201dI had not heard anything about the Korean Exchange Bank when Jamie reported to me. She had only said that the warehouse was empty. So, she had been careful in using the remaining funds, and her choice seemed to have been the Korean Exchange Bank.\u201cI argued for it, despite not knowing whether it was a good thing.\u201dFather spoke in a self-deprecating tone and walked forward like nothing had happened. The employees there already knew Father\u2019s face, and after greeting them, he began the same speech I had heard in the past.\u201cThe people are the ones who suffer and not the higher-up who had brought the country to ruin.\u201dWhile he said the same thing, he was wearing a suit and was not hiding his sadness. His gaze was deep as he looked at me.\u201cI want you to know how our country got here and be more interested in the economy in the future.\u201dThe past and the future met in this moment.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We will have a long talk about that.\u201dFather said that to me after placing a million won in my stock account.\u201cI\u2019ll study a lot.\u201dFather would have wanted to hear these words.\u201cAre you crying?\u201d***One may think this event may be a trivial domestic event that would not affect the world. However, everything started from here, despite the timing being inexplicably early. I had been surprised at the amount in the past, after all, we just ran a small grocery store, and bought a beginner\u2019s book for stock trading. I had picked the obvious choice, as the dotcom boom came to Korea at that time and the Korean stock market also rose. My stock account grew, and in March 2003, I would go and visit my friend Sungho and would boast like I had become a success.However, that was an era when an unidentified company would become the next hope for the future if they were a dotcom company. Koreans exploded after hearing amazing stories of instant millionaires, after the IMF, and I had not understood that even monkeys could get lucky. I lived a few days in fantasy and thought it was too easy to earn money and thought of myself as talented.It was a ridiculous memory now, and I cringed remembering asking Father for additional investment funds. I was now a successful high school trader and used the little knowledge I had gained from books and the internet.\u201cIs that so? But this time, I\u2019m lending you the money.\u201dI do not believe that Father had guessed it was just a bubble, but he probably thought that his son\u2019s beginner\u2019s luck would not last long despite being happy for me. Things turned down after a while, and in April 2000, the ceiling broke. When the American dotcom bubble broke, the Korean stock market also fell. I did the same thing every day after my studies. I would not do my homework but stare at the monitor of my computer after the markets closed. When my account became a quarter of my original amount, Father quietly came to my room.\u201cYou will need to pay back the money to me by next week, son.\u201d\\nI cried at his words, but Father was cold to me as I sobbed.\u201cThen, get the money from your mother since I need it badly.\u201d\u201cHow?\u201d\u201cGive me your allowance, and I will take away your CD player, cell phone, and computer. You realize that it is not nearly enough to pay me back, right?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cYou will have to tell your mother this. Don\u2019t pretend you\u2019re a grown up, and if you act nicely, your mother may forgive you and give you the money.\u201dI realized that it was a minuscule version of the IMF later. I decided on my future path and had a goal. I had a school and a major I desperately wanted to go to, and I worked hard to get into an elite university. (EN: Sun is Korea, his mother the IMF, and his father the foreign creditors. ^_^ )After military service, I prepared to study abroad in England and went to Wall Street after being impressed by Jillian. I had suffered losses and won victories until I was in my thirties, and it was then I was sent back to Korea after losing my company\u2019s money. The gates opened later, and I was thrown into the Trial Tests.While I lost heavily at Wall Street, I survived the Trial Tests. The reason I managed to come back here was due to this account. My bankbook started everything, and this had been my talisman like someone\u2019s pictures of their loved ones. It helped me whenever I wanted to die, and just before my return, it had been ripped and stained with blood.However, I now had it in its plastic envelope, and I thanked my father for it.***My phone rang after I brought my bankbook with me to the office, and her voice was weak and almost indecipherable. However, Yeonhee Woo mumbled a word out for me to hear.\\nYeonhee Woo found the dungeon? If it was true, it would be a memorable day for her too! It had been a week since I sent her, and I thought she had given up by yesterday. I had gone to her house and her family\u2019s house, but she had not returned. My cell phone rang about the time I thought it had been long enough, and it was time to go and pick her up. I had requested Yeonhee Woo to survive with the prepared food, walk as much as she could in the daylight, and get used to the darkness at night. I had not asked her to survive with nothing, and I just wanted her to find the dungeon entrance by herself.I went by driving her car, and she was sitting down where we had separated. I thought she was not moving because she did not have the strength to block the headlights with her hand, but I saw her smile. She was enjoying the light. She was wearing the training outfit I put in her backpack as an extra change of clothes, and the outfit was ripped and stained with blood.Her hair was all messed up, and she was smiling like that. Villagers would send her to a mental clinic, but I knew why she smiled like that. It came not after mere survival but a step forward. I supported her to the car.\u201cI\u2026lost the back\u2026pack\u2026\u201dIt did not matter.\u201cBut\u2026not this\u2026\u201dYeonhee Woo took out the metal box with the syringe.\u201cDid you see the System message that said you discovered the dungeon?\u201d\u201cYe\u2026s.\u201d \u201cYou did well.

It was right below a Challenger Box, and the System had been generous to the second place.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dYeonhee Woo seemed surprised at the row of computers in this room.\u201cDid you see the clothes on the table?\u201d\u201cThe paper bag? Is it for me?\u201d\u201cTake a shower first.\u201dI thought about the big picture while she showered, and things could go wrong. I had asked her whether she had been the second Awakened, and she replied no. There was a high possibility that one of the Eight Evils and Eight VIrtues got the reward, and the First Evil and the First Virtue would be the top candidates.However, if Yeonhee Woo had been the second person to discover a dungeon, no one had the ill luck to discover a dungeon before her.She came out with wet hair, and her skin was perfect due to being a prior Awakened. She only had minimal makeup on, and while she may think this was due to good cosmetics, we awakened do not need wrinkle care in the first place.\u201cCome and sit here.\u201dI did not ask her what had happened in the mountain as if it had taken a week to find the entrance, I knew what she would have gone through. She was tough inside that frail-looking body.I held out pen and paper and told her to write down everything she saw in her status window.\u201cStatus window.\u201dYeonhee Woo mumbled and wrote down the information.[Name: Yeonhee Woo\\nMental: F(20)Accumulated Points: 50Traits(1) Skill(3)][Empathy (Trait) Effect: The user can sometimes feel the target\u2019s emotions.

Class: F(0) Cool time: 5 minutes]These were expected and known, but the last skill was the one Yeonhee Woo had gotten from the Master Box.[Marie\u2019s Hand (Skill) Effect: The user dramatically nullifies the target\u2019s incapability to fight. Class: F(0) Cool time: 24 hours]This was from a Master Box, and Yeonhee Woo\u2019s codename was already decided. It would be Marie.***If an A or S class hunter had used the codename, I would have remembered. If so, I would have understood the explanation of the potentially A class skill \u2018Marie\u2019s Hand\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s important to understand what the system means in the skill description, and the word \u2018nullify\u2019 may be a double-edged sword. However, I think this would be an exceptional skill if there\u2019s a difference between the skill user and the target. Do you know what I mean?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about our teamwork, right?\u201dShe was correct.\u201cI believe that this skill transfers the target\u2019s wounds onto the user. You see the class F(0), right?\u201d\\nYeonhee Woo nodded.\u201cThe risk is large at the beginning. However, it will decrease as your skill class increases along with other factors. We need to test it here, rather than in a dungeon. How do you feel?\u201d\u201cNot bad.\u201dYeonhee Woo looked nervous from what I was feeling and her own emotions. One never got used to pain and just learned to endure it. Adrenaline in battle helped, but when one tested skills, one focused on pain and the skill\u2019s mechanics. I went to the exercise room and opened the drawer. Yeonhee Woo followed me and showed the same astonishment she had to the computer room, as she saw syringes, ampules, and plastic pillboxes.\u201cI\u2019m not a healer, so the only thing I can do is to alleviate the pain.\u201dI pushed the syringe into the ampule, and filled it. I placed it in a metal box, as she would need to be injected rather than take the painkillers orally.\u201cYou understand what I\u2019m trying to do, right?\u201dYeonhee Woo nodded with round eyes at my question. Inside the dungeon, who would fight? Her hands would break if I asked her to punch a weighted bag like in the boxing gym. I walked up to her and gave Yeonhee Woo a dagger.\u201cHere, have this. You wanted a knife, and it\u2019s more expensive than it looks.\u201d\u201c\u2026What?\u201dI moved to the other room after giving the knife to her, as blood was hard to remove from carpeting. The bathroom was still filled with steam as she had showered just before. Yeonhee Woo shook as she came with the dagger, and it was a natural reaction. So, I did not want to rush her.\u201cThings will go like this. You will stab me, and when I give you the signal, you\u2019ll use Marie\u2019s Hand. I should call it to transfer, as you will receive my wound. You will be in great pain.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThis floor is entirely mine, and the floors above and below are all empty. I own this building.

I was now cold and felt faint. Everything was becoming vague until the message box popped out.[Adversity Overcomer has been activated.]It was then everything became clear, and the shaking stopped.\u201cNow.\u201dYeonhee Woo had been waiting for me, and a new message came out with her screams.[Yeonhee Woo used Marie\u2019s Hand.]I felt my muscles jump and felt much more powerful than the last time I used Adversity Overcomer. I had not been healed like this then, but she was still screaming as she lay down on the tiled floor. I saw blood come from her stomach and was mixing with mine. I looked down on her.\u201cWe do not die from that. It is just painful.\u201dI saw her white face and pleading eyes. However, I only spoke a sentence.\u201cUse the syringe.\u201dEdited by Userunfriendly(EN: Ok, some questions have been asked by readers regarding this chapter. First of all, how did Sun know Marie\u2019s Hand would transfer his wounds to Yeonhee Woo? This is a fairly extreme logical leap. We don\u2019t know. We can assume that Sun has seen similar skills, or skills that work the same way in his past life. We don\u2019t know. I can only go on what the translator sends me.Couldn\u2019t the skill be tested on a paper cut? No! I made it clear when I added \u201cI had to wait until I bled out more if my wound was not crippling, like being stabbed in the eyes.\u201d Remember, the skill only works on \u201cThe user dramatically nullifies the target\u2019s incapability to fight.\u201d By getting stabbed, and suffering from internal bleeding, Sun made himself incapable of fighting.\u201cThe moment you are incapable of fighting, all stat levels and skill classes increase by one rank.\u201d It was no coincidence that the author used similar phrasing as the description for the Man Who Overcame Adversity. This was why I think Sun tested Marie\u2019s Hand by having Yeonhee Woo stab him. A bit extreme, no very extreme, but it would be worse to rely on this skill inside a dungeon, without fully understanding its limitations and effects. )Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

An S class dungeon has appeared in Hong Kong!\u201dI had put in much effort to turn them into survivors and had worked especially hard on one of them, the one with the most luck.

The keys will be in the car\u2026\u201dYeonhee Woo continued to explain behind my back.What she had feared had not happened, as her apartment was the same as it had been two days ago. I brought in the bags containing her clothes, underwear, and cosmetics.\u201cThank you.\u201dYeonhee Woo had unrolled the bandages on her stomach, and while she seemed a bit embarrassed, she was more surprised.\u201cIt\u2019s healing by a bit.\u201d\\n\u201cStay here until you\u2019re fully healed. Tell your family, so they won\u2019t worry.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry about that.\u201dYeonhee Woo spoke it was nothing, but I knew the reason for that fleeting bitter smile.\u201cAre you helping him out?\u201dShe was talking about Jonathan again, and she seemed to have decided on an answer as she looked at me the same way Jonathan did.\u201cI don\u2019t know what to do with the money.\u201d\u201cThe interest is 17% if you put it into a bank.\u201dYeonhee Woo would not know how amazing that number is, as a two-digit interest rate was considered the norm in the era right before the IMF. So, the public placed money in the banks to gain profit, which would be impossible in the future.\u201cYou\u2019re talking about money?!

I was opening up a bit to her, as she was following my orders better than I expected. She began to accept herself as an Awakened, and while her mental and physical capacities were lower since neither of us have taken the Trial Tests, it may be a plus for me.

You should hurry before all the bonds are sold since there is not much left.\u201dThe man left, and Jonathan smirked mentally.\u2018Does Silverman really believe that Russia won\u2019t go down? How much are they receiving to help maintain this pretense? Laugh while you can, since you\u2019ll be bankrupt soon.\u2019Jonathan smiled since he had also thought that Russia would not go down until recently, after talking to Sun. It was then Jonathan\u2019s eyes widened as he found the person he was looking for.He had not come here for only Russian bonds, and he had taken this long flight due to Sunhoo\u2019s advice that had been included in his notes.

More than a billion dollars in Russian bonds have been sold before Jonathan\u2019s arrival, but now the amount was three billion. Jonathan had \u201ccontributed\u201d much to that, as he had purchased a billion under the New York firm\u2019s name while his presence at the venue inflamed the investors. He had \u201csalted the mine\u201d, the mine called Russia.

However, I transliterated it as \u201csalting the mine\u201d to be more understandable to western, particularly American readers. ^_^ )Jonathan was in his private jet and had a satellite telephone on his ear.Then, Jonathan asked the flight attendants to leave him, and he spoke in a low voice.\\n< You did not forget that the European banks hate us, right? Not only that, but everyone knows the sucker bet we made with the great financial institutions on the Hong Kong interest rate. And how much we took from those institutions.>That was money thrown away, like the billion, just to \u201csalt the mine\u201d, as those who started out thinking that Russia would not go down were now more willing than ever to buy bonds. Also, other people were joining them, lest they miss out on an \u201cOpportunity\u201d, so a massive amount of money was flowing through Russia to buy Russian bonds. Jonathan and I had deliberately, and with malice aforethought, started an artificial \u201cboom\u201d in Russian Government bonds. I then spoke.\\nI changed the subject.No hedge fund would do that, but we had offered the Russian official seed money, and guaranteed that Jonathan would invest it and give him dividends, his \u201ccut\u201d.While the former Russian government had tried to bring in capitalism into a socialist system, the current president tried to dismantle the current system before embracing capitalism. As a result, he had many political enemies in Russia, and his ruin was certain if Russia went bankrupt, as it had happened in the past.Jonathan spoke like he was enjoying himself, and he had been in a good mood since he contacted me.

I hoped the estimated profit would fall more, as the account was investing in the Yen futures market. The loss meant that there was a high probability that investors have bought more Russian government bonds, strengthening the Russian Ruble. It was the only reason the Japanese yen would fall like this when considering the finance policies of relevant countries.

It was not only because of the difference in skin color, but those hedge funds had massively bought Russian bonds in June. Russia\u2019s bankruptcy meant huge losses.So, not only Russia but all the markets in the major Asian and European countries and the raw materials stock markets became battlefields. The war front spread with Russia at the center, and this situation had not existed in the past. Back then, the most significant event had been the major Asian countries significantly changing their financial policies, and it had not been this intense, nor had they been pushed into a corner to protect Russia.However, my salting the mine by a billion USD had changed their stance, and things will become hectic after the funds from New York and the Isle of Man came into play.***At a desk in the Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM), Gerald tightly clenched his fists. He wanted to scream, but he seemed not to have been the only one who had won. He looked at a comrade who met his eyes, and they quietly stood up.

If another suffered a huge loss after that, the firm would be removed.\u201cThey will be laughed at, as the idiot who wrote their investment proposal got everything wrong.\u201dGerald stifled a smile, even as it was the victor\u2019s right to laugh at the loser.\\nAs they gloated over their victory, the senior trader also came to the rest area and lit a cigarette near a window.

Everyone had thought that LTCM had gotten everything they needed to become a success story, and the firm became a global hedge fund. If LTCM, who managed a trillion dollar fund, placed large bets on Russian government bonds, it meant that the two Nobel Laureates believed that Russia would not fall.Who would want to join us if things were like that? The two suffering staggering losses to their credibility would be Jillian and Cheongsoo Kim. At this time all of my offshore funds showed a two-digit loss rate, and the one with the most losses was nearing margin call. If this trend continued, I would lose nearly forty percent of my original funds. I kept reminding myself that Russia\u2019s bankruptcy was a historical event, and my prediction was correct. (EN: A margin call occurs when the value of an investor\u2019s margin account falls below the broker\u2019s required amount. An investor\u2019s margin account contains securities bought with borrowed money (typically a combination of the investor\u2019s own money and money borrowed from the investor\u2019s broker).

Even though things were better now, what if, a very big what if, something had happened that could prevent Russian bankruptcy? What if there was a secret arrangement with other nations underway? I glared at the monitor with my arms folded. I thought that I would only need to watch over things, and that was the right choice. However, while I was not anxious, I felt tense. The date on the monitor read July 13th, and while I was busy glaring at the monitor, it was then that the phone rang.While it was a man speaking in English, it was not Jonathan.I guessed why he had called from that mechanical greeting, as I heard peoples\u2019 death over the phone like this before. I got the ledger and waited for the man to speak.It was a margin call, which meant one of my accounts was dead.\\nThe account with the Wizer Securities had been trading on the margin.[Account Name: Tailroad Corporation.][Account Value: $420,000][Estimated Loss: -$580,000][Estimated Profit: -13.50%]The employee ended the call after hearing my thanks. Tailroad had been going through one of the most intense battles, and the account died without hitting the jackpot. It did not take long for the account to die out, and Tailroad and other accounts had failed.I decided to leave them be, as this was only one of my many accounts trading on the margin. Those who were not in such danger were enduring quite well.There had once been a boss fight like this, and while it was strong, it was not that complicated to beat it. It was a reinforcement type monster, and such monsters would return to their original weak state after a while. If we managed to last until the monster\u2019s reinforced state dissipated, we won. If not, we all died. However, the rewards had been great, as there were Platinum Boxes everywhere.Russia was harder than that, as we were fighting against the knights who were defending Russia to save themselves. However, the truth was that Russia was dying and would fall soon.\\n***It was Korea\u2019s constitution day, and I came to the office early.\u201cYou came?\u201dYeonhee Woo welcomed me holding a bow, as she had been diligently practicing, and she had finished preparing for my arrival already. I saw newspapers arranged neatly on the table, and the printer was spitting out hardcopies. The television was turned to CNBC Asia from Singapore instead of a Korean channel. She had started acting like my secretary since last week, and I had let her do so.\u201cDid you have breakfast?\u201dI nodded and went to the printer. Yeonhee Woo would bring the main articles from finance websites such as Financial Times because I was interested in them, and I felt it was more prudent to use her email account to register for the newsletters, particularly the English only periodicals. Anyway, yesterday\u2019s articles were also about the war in the Russian market. Western finance journals had begun to use the word \u2018war\u2019 about the time Yeonhee Woo started acting like my secretary. There was a five-hour difference with Moscow as they would use Daylight Savings Time until 2014, and it would be five o\u2019clock in the morning there. Major announcements usually occurred between ten-thirty and twelve o\u2019clock, as the officials would be finished being briefed by then.So, if things did not happen between two-thirty and four o\u2019clock in the afternoon in Korea, nothing would happen that day. A week had passed since I stopped running into the office after school, and it was then Yeonhee Woo asked me a question.\u201cSummer vacation started, right?\u201d\u201cFrom yesterday.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nice. You waited for a long time. However, if we\u2019re talking about explaining your absence to your parents, how about taking the CSAT? I was your first-grade homeroom teacher, and\u2026\u201d (EN: The College Scholastic Ability Test or CSAT is a standardized test which is recognized by South Korean universities.)\\n\u201cHedge funds have been aggressive in the past to gain profit, and the effect was more negative than positive. Think about how Asia suffered from late last year to now.\u201d\u201cI believe that hedge funds are like hackers, as there are both good and bad ones. However, I believe that hedge funds work the same way hackers do to the companies they target, as they expose their vulnerable points and give the targeted company a chance to reinforce or remove their weaknesses.\u201d\u201cThe problem is that the hedge funds are bad hackers who are after a lot of money. The Russian financial war is not between two hedge funds, and there will be a lot of collateral damage.\u201d\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think so. The majority of the transactions are dealt in the futures market, and most of them are institutions who use the hedge funds.\u201dOne of them was attacking hedge funds while the other was defending them. It was then the main anchor stopped their discussion.\u201cThere has been a major announcement in Moscow about a moratorium just now.\u201dI felt my body sink into the sofa at those words, and various muscles that I didn\u2019t even know I had, unclenched for the first time in months. Russia had finally fallen.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(EN: Margin trading refers to the practice of using borrowed funds from a broker to trade a financial asset, which forms the collateral for the loan from the broker.)\\n\u201cIt ended\u2026New York and Isle of Man will also be frenetic now.\u201d***There were shouts of shock and disbelief on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange, while other financial institutions along Wall Street literally screamed in horror. Those in Jonathan Investments were screaming for a different reason, as three floors screamed Brian\u2019s name.It was like the chant for a batter who had hit the winning home run in the ninth inning of the World Series. Every trader was screaming Cheongsoo Kim\u2019s name, and he was dazed because he had been more surprised than anyone else. Cheongsoo Kim felt like he had died when the breaking news came, even when it had been a time to shout for joy. The reason he felt like throwing up was due to the massive pressure he had endured, and Cheongsoo Kim looked at his subordinates. He knew some of their names, as Cheongsoo Kim read their personal newsletters. (EN: A personal newsletter is sent to the people you know i.e. the ones you find in your address book.)Not only that, but they were all from Ivy League universities, and this floor alone held over thirty such employees. Other floors also held that many people, and when he was put in charge of twenty billion dollars in funds and over one hundred elite employees, Cheongsoo Kim felt terror rather than joy.He had suffered through the venomous stares from his elite subordinates and had nightmares of being eaten alive by them. However, he had managed to succeed, and Cheongsoo Kim somehow stood up. He did not realize that he was crying, and everyone quieted down when his mouth opened so that his confused voice was heard across the floor.\u201cI had actually been waiting to study under such amazing professionals like you and am learning every day.\u201dCheongsoo Kim only then realized he was crying from how wet his voice was, and they were tears of relief and not joy.\u201cToday\u2019s victory was due to all of you and Jonathan. He\u2019s the best strategist there is, and you are all heroes. Thank you for having me here.\u201dApplause filled the room. Cheongsoo Kim knew that humility did work here, as he had worked in New York fast-food restaurants for over five years.\u201cCongratulations! Brian!\u201dJonathan had come from the top floor, and now everyone shouted Jonathan\u2019s name. He waved to the employees as he remembered his first impressions of Cheongsoo Kim. He seemed defeated, as Sun said, and Jonathan could not trust him at first to manage such a large project. His credentials had been trivial, and he did not know what Sun had seen in him at all.\\n\u201cI knew that Brian would be able to do this, and he is our biggest prize from this Russian finance war.\u201dJonathan called Brian\u2019s name, and the entire office erupted. Today was a day that called for such a cheer, as this was a historic victory. Today\u2019s victory will be remembered, and economics professors would assign papers on this war to their students, and the process would be repeated through the generations.Jonathan and Cheongsoo Kim\u2019s eyes met, and while those in Wall Street did not use the word genius lightly, they saw each other as such.***Jillian was happy. Jillian had suffered much due to addiction resulting from being introduced to recreational drugs by a successful friend, and while he had small and large victories in the past, Jillian was embarrassed when he realized that this was the greatest ecstasy he had ever experienced. The chemical ecstasy had been rapturous, but that was only a temporary joy that would be followed by agonizing self torment.However, the joy Jillian felt now was like the heavenly catharsis and vindication that came only with an amazing victory.\u201cWhy are you so calm? Everyone would just clap if you danced around naked.\u201dJessica spoke because she had watched history in the making from beginning to end. Therefore, she could not understand why Jillian acted like that when they had won using fifteen billion dollars.\u201c\u2026Who are they?\u201d\u201cThose that wrote the investment proposal? I\u2019m dying to know too.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dJillian walked up to the open door, and all the employees in the Isle of Mann firm were screaming. He almost jumped into the mosh pit of hundreds of elite employees shouting for joy, but he returned to his office and spoke to Jessica.\\nJillian now came out of the excitement the victory had brought.\u201cThey didn\u2019t just dip their toe into the Russian bankruptcy.\u201d\u201cThey were like us and they were aggressive like hell to our shared opposition. Moreover, there may be another genius who was certain that Russia would go down.\u201d\u201cTheir director and his deputy, who coordinated, were perfect.\u201d\u201cI liked them. Aren\u2019t they like us?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being romantic. This world is more cutthroat than you think.\u201dJillian grimaced, and Jessica quietly went to a corner to call her New York friends. She stood after hearing their answers and waited for Jillian to ask her. However, Jillian was concentrating on the monitor screen so much that he did not even hear Jessica\u2019s voice. She also looked at Jillian\u2019s monitor, which showed the data on the Russian bond selling event held in Moscow around June. A picture of Jonathan shaking hands with Russians and Silverman Sox there after buying a billion dollars in Russian bonds was shown on another screen.Jessica realized that her boss had found the answer, and Jillian tapped Jonathan\u2019s image on the monitor.\u201cIt\u2019s this guy again.\u201dJillian had to acknowledge his inadequacy, as he could not have won without that investment proposal. While finance managers were said to specialize in their own fields, Jonathan was an exception. He had bought Russian bonds to salt the mine while knowing that Russia was going down. He had brought the hedge funds in with that move, and Jillian\u2019s profit was skyrocketing. Was all this due to Jonathan? Jillian clucked his tongue and stood up.\u201cDid you wrap up?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJessica rushed to open the door and step into the chaos while shouting Jillian\u2019s name, which everyone was chanting. (EN: In case you guys were puzzled, please remember Sun set up the Isle of Man on his own, so Jillian and Jessica don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re working for Jonathan\u2019s partner.

    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: Past Life Returner Chapter 65 \\nChapter 65\\nThere is a saying about Hedge Funds, it\u2019s claimed that they will do just about anything, including cheating widows, and robbing orphanages to gain profit.This leads people to not understand hedge funds, and because of this misperception, the public tends to see hedge funds as ravenous monsters who will attack anything in search of money. However, they forget that profit starts from protecting one\u2019s own funds. One needs to think about defense first, and while hedge funds profit by attacking vulnerable assets, they also plan for what happens after losing since hedge funds cannot see the future. Therefore, the portfolio of most hedge funds are not about attacking, as NOT losing was actually more important. Adding up the portfolios of hedge funds with varying stances, as not all hedge funds followed this strategy the same way, the hedge funds of over a billion dollars had an average profit rate of twenty percent in this era.Now, let\u2019s talk about us. We had two miracles in Thailand last year and earned 70,000% profit during the first miracle and 17,800% during the second. The hedge fund money that was used to attack Asia came into our pockets, and then we tried to reach maximum profit during the Hong Kong shock and earned a profit of 30%.We should think about the fact that one needed at minimum, one main director, one executive manager, and three assistant traders to manage a billion-dollar hedge fund desk team. How many would we need for fifty billion? Funds were difficult to manage when the amount increased, and that was why successful hedge fund founders decreased the amount after some success. That meant an increase in the starting amount would not lead to the same profit rate, due to the difficulty of managing such large sums, which was reality.The last question was this. I knew that the Hong Kong shock would happen. Taking everything into consideration, was the 30% profit rate Jonathan and I made with fifty billion dollars large or small?***The accounts that I had assigned to \u201cSpecial Operations\u201d, to manipulate the movements of our rivals, all died out after a month, and I deliberately used them knowing they could not win. I thought one of them being profitable would be a miracle because I did not know what would happen like I had in Thailand. The accounts were all used to spread disinformation, and I used one hundred million dollars for this. The result was that one managed to profit, and the account\u2019s name was Unicorn. (EN: Disinformation: False information which is intended to mislead, especially propaganda issued by a government organization to a rival power or the media.)[Account Name: Unicorn Corporation][Account Value: $579,500,000][Evaluated Profit: +$574,500,000][Estimated Profit: +11590%]The plan was a success with this one, and I brought all others in to calculate the total profit rate.\u201cAbout 300%, which means nine billion dollars\u2026\u201dThere would be an additional three billion in costs, which meant twelve billion gross profit. I was happy, but remembered that this happened because everything had fallen into place. First, Russia went down, second, the hedge funds came in aggressively, and third, the fund amount was three billion. Last year, managing the detailed transactions for fifty billion, was hell. I did not want to do it again, and as I saw the calculations I made, it reminded me I had come back in time.I had not felt like this during Thailand in my previous life, as that had been a war. I had lost over one hundred million to my company, and it had been more devastating because the entire world had been in an economic boom. I had been blind for victory, and it was a miracle I had not been sued. However, my credentials had gotten love calls from Korean banks after I went back to Korea, but I did not go back to work. Instead, I spent time with my father. While remembering the past, it was then that Jonathan contacted me.I could feel what the numbers would be from his voice.\\nJonathan had gone through the fifty billion dollar episode with me, and therefore his voice was as excited as he had been in Thailand.(EN: Please ask Google-sensei about the myth of King Suro, and the golden cord from heaven. ^_^ Obviously Jonathan has been reading up on Korea. )Even if the contract had been the minimum in the field, people would become rich. I had limited the profit bonus of 20%, the industry\u2019s average, to 1% for the special hedge fund Black Swan. There had been people in Onider who had walked out of the office before hearing the entire contact, which was natural. Wall Street managers lived by a strict performance-based system and would earn ten to twenty times their annual salary from bonuses. Those from Onider had been such people, but we managed to calm them down after mentioning that they would not be held responsible for Jonathan\u2019s directions and any resultant losses for Black Swan, which held my and Jonathan\u2019s personal funds and the American pension funds. The 1% profit was nine hundred million dollars anyway.They would receive bonuses according to their positions, which would be about nine million dollars each. It may be small, considering the jackpot they just hit. Actually, considering the corporate tax for investment profits\u2026Jonathan mentioned that point.I knew what Jonathan was thinking, but someone needed to be visible and not in the hidden offshore accounts. We needed to placate the US government, by surrendering a share of the profits from the profit made by our visible assets.\\nI spoke after reading the mail.***Jessica ran into Jillian\u2019s office after receiving the file from accounting.\u201cI got the calculations!\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201dHowever, Jillian had to stand up to read them as Jessica froze after reading the documents. She gave them to Jillian with a dazed expression.[Total Profit Rate: +615%][Profit: $92,250,000,000]The total was over a hundred billion after adding the original investment money.\u201cThis is\u2026astounding!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be so loud.\u201dJessica looked at her boss with amazement at his calm after seeing such a number. However, she then felt something else from her boss.\u201cI cannot understand why you are not satisfied.\u201dJessica asked brazenly.\u201cThis is not enough.\u201d\\n \u201cListen carefully when I say that we could have earned more.\u201dEdited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Since there is no corporate tax in the Isle of Man, the profits went straight into Jonathan\u2019s and my accounts, and after excluding other fees, the total was about one hundred billion dollars. New York\u2019s payout was about eighty billion after taxes, and my offshore accounts held another twelve billion dollars. So, we held about two hundred billion dollars now, and the war we had gone through was more savage than ever before. Someone lost as we won, and the aftermath will be just as cruel.LTCM going down with Russia had happened in my previous life and had been the starting point of the 2007-2008 Global Financial Crisis that the Subprime Mortgage Crisis of 2007 will trigger. How many more will fall? But now was not the time to think about such things. (EN: LTCM Long-Term Capital Management)\\n***Jonathan wanted to meet me at the airport, but he could not do so since the losers had started to come to him. I hurried to find a taxi and texted Jonathan about my arrival after getting out of the airport. I arrived at Wall Street and wondered yet again, how such a small street moved global finances. I got out at Trinity Church. (EN: yes, they had texting back then. ^_^ )\\n-Isn\u2019t this grand? But remember, the losers are buried in the graveyard.The man whose name I could not remember had spoken those words to me when I studied abroad in my previous life. The atmosphere was desolate, and I saw some managers walk around like zombies. It seemed a few of them would go straight into the grave at this rate.Those I suspected were financial reporters fared better, merely shocked and not suicidal, and I heard some words clearly as I passed them. Bankruptcy, LTCM, market collapse, crisis expansion, and Russia. It was ironic to see that America, after being so wary of Russian nuclear weapons, had been attacked by the effects of capitalism.However, my New York head office was filled with smiling faces, and the difference was like heaven and hell. I told the receptionist in the lobby that I had an appointment and sat in the reception area. There were three other people who seemed to have been working in Wall Street for a while, waiting for Jonathan. They seemed to know each other well despite having been in different companies. They stopped talking when I came in and started looking over the documents that they had brought with them. Obviously they were wary of talking in front of outsiders.A little bit later, the office door opened, and the men rose. The person who had come out of the office with Jonathan walked away, and Jonathan went back in and closed the door. The secretary then told me that I could go in.At those words, the three men looked at me in astonishment, but I went in without caring about it.\u201cIt\u2019s hectic around here, but welcome.\u201dJonathan took off his necktie and jacket to lean against his chair.\u201cDid you see that bald guy that just left? He\u2019s from LTCM and asked me to lend him two billion dollars. However, he didn\u2019t mention management shares, and everyone is like that.\u201dJonathan clenched his teeth and, after a minute, asked me whether I wanted something to drink.\u201cYou\u2019re too busy. Do you have the list?\u201dJonathan took out a document from his desk drawer and added LTCM before handing it to me.\\n\u201cThings are quite serious. The government will have a big enough headache over LTCM alone, but look at the list.\u201dThis was the beggar\u2019s list, and the names written there had been our enemies a few days ago. We had fought with everything we had, and the defeated were coming to beg for their lives. They were asking Jonathan to lend them money so they could avoid bankruptcy.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI could not speak after looking over the list, as famous banks and hedge funds filled the page. It was not only them, but their clients, pensions, and products that went in the trillions. If they all went bankrupt, the resulting financial crisis would be catastrophic. I saw a monitor on the wall.\u201cTurn up the volume.\u201dI heard the head of the US Treasury speak.\u201cThe world may be going through the worst global financial crisis in seventy years, right now.\u201dHe was mentioning the Great Depression, and our faces turned dark. This was the turning point, and I sat across Jonathan after turning off the monitor. We looked at the list.\u201cThe greedy bastards. They don\u2019t want to part with money even while going down, despite knowing what will happen.\u201dJonathan was seriously angry. While we did start the Russian financial war, we were the victors and we did not blame ourselves for what would happen to the losers after their defeat. Obviously, Jonathan thought that he and I would be more realistic had we been the losers. Jonathan was venting out his anger to me, and I saw the bloodthirsty light I had seen in my previous life for the second time now.\u201cThey are bringing it onto themselves.\u201d\u201cWrap up today\u2019s schedule, Jonathan.\u201d\\nIt was not only Jonathan who had things to do, and I had something big in front of me. I went back to Korea to my office, and Yeonhee Woo shook the car keys after finishing the preparations. We went on the road to Gimje, and after wandering the mountain for a while, I also got the message.[You discovered a dungeon.]Since Yeonhee Woo had discovered a dungeon by herself, she also had the Explorer title. We looked at each other and started the preparations. I marked the perimeters with the fishing line and stuck the signpost. I called Choi on the way to Seoul and thought that these preparations would become some sort of ritual after discovering a dungeon. (EN: Choi was the guy who built the first dungeon enclosure, remember?)Therefore, I was starting the next dungeon\u2019s construction before going into the F class dungeon that nearly killed me the first time.\u201cThe mental hospital had started like this.\u201dYeonhee Woo remarked after I finished my phone call.\u201cIt will be tomorrow.\u201d\u201cDo I have anything to prepare?\u201d\u201cSleep well. You won\u2019t be able to from tomorrow.\u201d\u201cAnd?\u201d\u201cWrite your will if you won\u2019t.

An F class skill Night Eyes and three quests.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re going to the entrance room.\u201dI heard the door creak, and the entrance room had been safe as it had been the last time. Only darkness waited for us there, and I confirmed the number of doors first by looking at the walls. After the dungeon was reset, there was only one door. We had no choice but to open it. Yeonhee Woo was drawing the map, and her ballpoint was shaking. I spoke to her.\u201cIt\u2019s natural to feel fear and anxiety. You can cry or scream on seeing them, and it\u2019s a normal response in your first battle. Just don\u2019t move out of my sight, and I only need you to do that.\u201d\\n\u201cI understand.\u201dYeonhee Woo spoke as she looked over my shoulder, and she was quiet.\u201cWe will go into the first corridor.\u201dI spoke as I opened the wooden door and saw that there were no traps. The corridor was quiet, but it was only a moment later I heard footsteps running toward us. Their numbers were not much, and I estimated three or four at maximum. I held a dagger in one hand and a longsword in the other and waited calmly.I saw sharp teeth and the monster\u2019s head and stabbed my dagger between its eyes. The monster threw itself on me with the dagger stuck on its forehead, and I stepped back to avoid the tackle. I stomped on its head as it stared at me and heard her gasp at the loud crunch, behind me.While the sounds were coming near, no one entered my sights, which gave me time to prepare. I yanked out the dagger by stepping on its face and looked around us.[You have beaten the Declan Patrol Soldier.][You have gained 1 point.][Accumulated points: 163.][Declan Extermination: Exterminated Declan Soldier 33/60]I was startled when two came at me at the same time. While I held two weapons, I had no intention of using them simultaneously. I had no qualms about letting a weapon go, as the situation dictated and I abandoned the long blade after piercing a monster with it.It was when I was stepping sideways when the third came rushing at me. I realized that it was too late for me to avoid it, as it was too fast. The monster tried to rake my face with its claws, and I stabbed at its face at the same time.\\nWhile I was dazed for a second as my head took the hit, I felt my dagger hit and raked its face as I toppled backward from the body blow. I managed to overturn the situation at the last moment, with the mutt underneath me. While its hand was large enough to cover my face, I could see between its long claws. It was trying to bite me and push me back, but I used my dagger to rip the mutt\u2019s throat open.[Yeonhee Woo used Physical Healing.][Your wounds heal by a little.]I managed to sit up, and my dagger went into its chest. I stabbed it for the final time, and after the kill message popped up, I stood up. I wiped the blood on my face and looked at Yeonhee Woo.She was looking in my direction with her face frozen. She was not able to overcome her revulsion and fear. Yeonhee Woo had frozen, and only her wild eyes looked at me. I was surprised she had managed to use the skill, and while I had not needed it, the cooldown time was short anyway.I pointed behind me with my thumb at the mutt that was barely breathing with my longsword stuck in its abdomen.\u201cFinish him.\u201d (EN: ^_^)I did not need to give her my dagger, as Yeonhee Woo had one on her thigh. She just needed to take it out and finish the monster off, as I had taught her how to use one. It would be easy to end the monster\u2019s life, but it was difficult for her because it had a humanoid body.Even if the monster was not human-shaped, killing something big was terrifying for civilians. However, Yeonhee Woo needed to do this, and she slowly took out the dagger on her thigh. She moved slowly to stand next to the writhing monster. While I could not see her face, I knew what her expression would be. I spoke as I stared at her.\u201cJust stab as hard as you can anywhere in the chest.\u201dI did not speak loudly, but my voice rang because everything was so quiet. Yeonhee Woo had frozen, and I thought maybe this had been too early. If she forgot that she was a healer, she could get used to this. The question was whether the dungeon would wait for her.I was walking up to her when she spoke in a loud voice.\\nThe reason that fantasy movies rendered their monsters\u2019 blood green was to avoid being censored. However, this was reality. We had come back to the entrance room, and I was installing a more intricate trap than I had before.\u201cHey.\u201dShe looked at me instead of replying.\u201cYou did well in the corridor and successfully used your skill.\u201dYeonhee Woo looked surprised, but her performance had been acceptable. During the Trial Tests, when people saw monsters for the first time, there had been a lot of people who just lost it. Some shouted crazy things, cried for their mothers, and even clung to those who were trying to fight. Women would look at men and scream at them to do something.I set up the trap and did not think I needed to warn her about stepping on it. She already knew, and her eyes seemed to be carefully analyzing the trap. We moved again to the door that led to the first room. In my previous attempt, I had gotten jumped here by about twenty mutts before, and perhaps since I had told her that, she was shaking like a child.She was merely holding her bow, and I whispered in her ear before opening the door.\u201cWhat did I say to do when you find that you cannot control yourself?\u201dConcentrate. Yeonhee Woo mouthed the words.\u201cDon\u2019t forget your mental skills.\u201dHunters like Yeonhee Woo found their strength by sharing the emotions of others. By sharing my resolve and hatred of these mutts, and feeling my determination to end them.\u201cConcentrate on me.\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s body stopped shaking after those words.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She realized how insufficient her imagination had been, despite having thought that she was \u201cprepared\u201d. How laughable! Yeonhee Woo simply had been unable to imagine the reality of the shrieks and growling roars of hunting predators, the putrid stench of carrion eaters and the metallic scent of their blood, and the terrifying speed of these creatures.The monsters that Sunhoo had drawn were real, and she could feel the emotions coming from the monsters. She shuddered at the monsters\u2019 rage and hunger towards Sunhoo, and was horrified by their frenzy to rip and tear at his abdomen, to feast on his soft innards. Her world crumbled for the second time when Sunhoo sat on the monster to stab its chest. It was not a battle between good and evil, the dungeon was a war of survival.The standards between monsters and humans did not exist there, and the man who survived was a stranger to Yeonhee Woo. Her face went white when the bloody man came to her to demand she plunge a dagger into a monster.Now, her world was about to crumble for the third time due to the man standing at the door and the nightmare she could see beyond his shoulder. The room beyond was filled with monsters, and her mental preparations did not work. The shrieks and the savagery of the creatures that wanted to kill her were hell. And in hell, instead of fire, there was darkness, and monsters screamed instead of sinners. Bleeding and still twitching and thrashing monster bodies piled up in front of the man.\u201cHeal!\u201dYeonhee Woo used her skill, as she remembered one thing that the man had said. If he died, she would die too. If he died, monsters would come for her through the door currently blocked by the man and his blades. She could not take her eyes off their glowing yellow eyes, as they were filled with the instinct to kill. Yeonhee Woo shuddered again, and she felt faint. Her world was becoming a ruin, but a human scream filled her ears. It was from the man.[You cannot use the skill.][Cooldown time: 03:30]\\nShe could still use \u2018Marie\u2019s Hand,\u2019 but a monster rushed at her when Sunhoo had stumbled for a moment. She met its eyes, and the monster\u2019s movements were too fast as it charged at her.\u201cNo!\u201dYeonhee Woo screamed not at the monster but at the man, as the room would be filled with monsters when he moved from his position. It was right after her scream that she saw the monster\u2019s body on the ground with an arrow sticking out of it.She remembered screaming at Sunhoo but did not remember what she did with her bow. She came to her senses now as she stabbed the monster\u2019s chest. Yeonhee Woo started in surprise when the man spoke.\u201cGood!\u201dShe looked at the man, and while the man was now looking forward again after confirming what she had done, she could read in that brief instant their eyes met that he had praised her. Yeonhee Woo\u2019s world was restored again, and she placed an arrow in her bow as she covered his back.***[Declan Extermination: Exterminated Declan Soldier 54/60]\\n[Accumulated Points: 184]There had been nineteen monsters in the first room, and now there were six left before the quest was completed. There were no other monsters after the last message. While the mutts had some intelligence, they were not smart enough to hide when they could attack.\u201cClear.\u201dWe returned to the first room as we walked past the corpses until we could see none. We both sat on the ground, and Yeonhee Woo offered me a white pill with her bloody hand. While my dagger was laced with Odin\u2019s Wrath and my left arm had been hardened by the Iron Skin skill, we could not go into the next room like this. I swallowed the pill and lay down.\u201cContinue to heal me while I rest for a while.\u201dI could not sleep immediately, and there were still some pains left despite the painkiller. The scenes I just saw flew by. Trying to protect Yeonhee Woo was a luxury, and I had to forget her when I went into battle. Then, I just improvised as I fought hand to claw, despite being a battle between weaklings. If my levels increased, we would not need to do this again. Until then\u2026[Yeonhee Woo used Physical Healing.][Your wounds heal a little.]\\nEffect: Restricts the target.Class: ECooldown Time: Seven days]I took it silently and wore it on my neck. We did not need words, she remembered her contract in her silence. She was to give me any items that she could hand over, but I did not expect Yeonhee Woo to react this way. She should have realized the value of items, but she did not seem dissatisfied as she looked at me. Yeonhee Woo spoke.\u201cIf we go back alive, right?\u201dI nodded. I would give her the money as written on the contract. Did she like money this much? I did know how stupid it was to presume to know a person. What mattered was that she had a strong goal.

Yeonhee Woo moved to the farthest point in the room away from me, as she knew that I could get cursed and attack her. She looked nervous, and could she do what I instructed her to do, if the worst-case scenario happened?\u201cI\u2019ll open the box.\u201dYeonhee Woo nodded, and I reached out my hand towards the box. I saw a message.[Will you open the box?]\u201cYes.\u201dI saw a flash of light.[Your stamina increased by 9.][Stamina: F(23)]I was satisfied with the result, as the number was random between one and ten. I was actually extremely lucky and sent the all clear sign to Yeonhee Woo. However, she did not come to me but stopped at a distance. I had warned her about curses, but she seemed relieved, like she had felt my inner peace. I had never formed a party with her type and I had avoided the Second Evil, who had used mental skills, at all costs. They were rare and formidable, and I had been right avoiding them as I saw Yeonhee Woo sense my emotions. What if they had joined my party with malicious intentions?Yeonhee Woo\u2019s body shook at that moment.[Yeonhee Woo used Heal Fear.]She looked surprised, and the arrow in her bow was pointed at me. I spoke calmly.\u201cThat\u2019s the way to do it. You unnecessarily used a skill, but you did well.\u201dYeonhee Woo was asking with her eyes an explanation.\u201cI was thinking of the past and did not expect you would react to that.\u201d\\n\u201cSorry. I should have waited a bit more.\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s bow was turned to point to the ground.\u201cNo, you\u2019re doing well as I taught you.\u201d\u201cBut.\u201d\u201cWe have time, as my skills are on cooldown. We can slow down a bit.\u201dWhile mental healers were a double-edged sword, I did not need to fear dungeon boxes anymore. Yeonhee Woo knew she could not survive alone without me, so she could be trusted. I gave her a dungeon quiz question. (EN: Yes, as mentioned, this was why Sun no longer feared dungeon boxes.)\u201cWhat doors do you see?\u201d\u201cThere is one in each direction, and the one we entered this room from.\u201dShe had not opened a door alone and stood nervously now. While we would need to be wary of traps from now on, F class traps were primitive and gave us points. I discovered the same trap as the one from my first visit, though of course the dungeon had been reset. Yeonhee Woo was leaning against the wall behind me.\u201cYou see that string on the doorknob? We should take care of this first.\u201dShe nodded quickly.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201dI changed positions, and she stared at her dagger while I gripped her backpack straps with both hands.\u201cI\u2019m cutting it now.\u201dYeonhee Woo moved her arm as she spoke.\\n[You have been given 1 point.]The moment the message popped up, I pulled Yeonhee Woo as hard as I could towards me, and we fell together in a heap. The door exploded with a boom, and fragments showered over us. After a few minutes, I stood up first and extended my hand towards her. She was still looking at the huge stone ball that had just swung on the chain above us, which by now had stopped swinging. She took my hand, and hers was cold as I raised her up.\u201cCongratulations. You have been the second to complete the hidden quest.\u201dI recited the message she would be reading.\u201cYou have gained a bronze box as your reward.\u201dHer eyes were moving as she read the text I couldn\u2019t see, and I saw a bright light flash in her eyes as the box opened. I knew without her speaking that it was not an insignia or an item, as her gaze was still looking ahead. Her lips opened.\u201cMy skill stats were raised. Marie\u2019s Hand is now F(6).\u201d***While Odin\u2019s Wrath was a formidable skill, its weakness was that I could use it only thirty minutes a day. However, I dared not open the next door without being able to use it.[Remaining Cool Time: 21 Hours 30 Minutes 21 Seconds][Remaining Cool Time: 21 Hours 30 Minutes 20 Seconds]We were waiting for the countdown to end, and Yeonhee Woo was lying down with her eyes closed.

I patted her shoulder silently and sat down. It was not bad to have a person talk with, though that was not the reason I had her join me. While the dungeon was silent again, I could hear her breathing and rustling. That made me not think of the past in the darkness.***\u201cClear.\u201dThe door with the trap opened to an empty corridor, and I stood in front of the door that went to the next room. She knew what to do, and I did not need to order her. She stood with her bow raised, and I slowly approached the door. There were no traps, and I just needed to open it.My heart started to beat faster again, and in my previous life, this had continued until I entered A class. All hunters preferred Gate Overflow battles, rather than dungeon conquests because of this. I pointed at the door, and Yeonhee Woo nodded.\u201cWe will enter the second room.\u201dMy voice was tense, and I opened the door while I was speaking. I got goosebumps when I saw what was beyond the door.[You have activated Iron Skin.][You have activated Odin\u2019s Wrath.]I shouted to Yeonhee Woo while not taking my eyes off the room beyond the door.\u201cDon\u2019t heal me until I say so!\u201dEdited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I knew that it was stronger than other mutts, and the system had named it a warrior. In the past, the E class hunters had to charge it en-masse to kill it, and the only positive thing was that it was the nearest monster to the door.The monster behaved the same as my recollections, and it flung aside the other mutts running towards me from behind and growled, asserting its dominance.The sounds made by the twin heads were fierce, and no other monsters dared to come forward. However, I knew that they would become hyenas and rush at me to pull me down as a pack, should I be weakened by the Alpha. I backed away as the monster came toward me, as my strength was too low to face it hand to hand. I retreated to create a space where I could move, as the monster had to lower its head to come through the door. The doorway was an advantage. Since a monster that big had appeared, it was natural that Yeonhee Woo\u2019s breathing became rapid. I glared at the monster.\u201cAre you a wolf or a mutt? Keep the curs back.\u201dWhile it would not understand me, the monster must have felt something. One of its heads turned back and made a warning sound to others. As the other continued to glare at me, an ambush would be impossible. I would need to counter the first rush by the boss, as this situation was more effective when I was at a disadvantage. The boss will not call for the other mutts to swarm me if it thinks it can bring me down by itself.The head that had turned back now looked at me, and the monster\u2019s body bristled, and its glare had a different light. The monster was ready, and I remembered my fear from the first time. However, I had fought mutts one-on-one countless times, and if I did not fear it, I could do this. I used Iron Skin to reinforce my left arm as my shield, and began.***\u2018Give me an order!\u2019Yeonhee Woo was about to scream to Sunhoo to let her heal him. The blue sparks following Sunhoo\u2019s dagger did not look as dangerous as they had before, as the monster did not flinch when he stabbed it. Instead, the monster had struck Sunhoo down, and while he managed to stand up again, there was blood flowing from his mouth. While Yeonhee Woo did not know much about battle, she knew that the monster was too strong as Sunhoo had warned her. It overpowered Sunhoo in both strength and speed, and the monster did not flinch when it was wounded.\\nOn the other hand, every moment was dire for Sunhoo, as the monster would just bite or strike him no matter how much he attacked it.\u2018No!\u2019Yeonhee stifled a scream when Sunhoo\u2019s body flew, and the monster strangled him against the wall. Sunhoo managed to strike with his dagger once before his body went limp. Yeonhee Woo\u2019s gaze followed the dagger Sunhoo had dropped from his hand to the pool of blood. She was desperately trying NOT to use her skill or her arrows.-Do not use any skills when I fight the twin-headed monster. I may look like I\u2019m dying, but I will be waiting for the Man Who Overcame Adversity to kick in, and when doing so, you must\u2026Yeonhee Woo remembered Sunhoo\u2019s orders, and her gaze moved towards the door.-You have to run away as fast as you can should the mutts go after you.Sunhoo had been right as the monsters beyond the door growled louder and louder in excitement. She wanted to cover her ears and knew that the time to run was near. Yeonhee Woo saw Sunhoo in pain and remembered a memory from her past. The entire family had gone fishing, and a fish had escaped from the bucket. While it had writhed and flopped around on the ground, it became still after a while, and her father had picked it up. It started flailing again, but the movements told her the fish was dying.Sunhoo was like that fish now, and she wanted to do anything that would free him from the monster\u2019s grasp. She had done so countless times in her head. However\u2026-Do not use Marie\u2019s Hand at this time, as that is for the boss fight. You cannot endure such deep wounds. Just think of your survival even if I look like I\u2019m dying. I won\u2019t be able help you in that situation, so remember this.\\nYeonhee Woo needed to follow those words if she wanted BOTH of them to survive, so she shed her backpack so she could move faster.Sunhoo\u2019s scream was not loud, but it was a signal for her, as the monsters began to roar and ran after her. She turned away from Sunhoo and started to run. The baying of the hounds were close by the time she returned to the first room. Yeonhee Woo looked around, her breathing rough. The room layout was confusing since it was dark. She was aiming for the entrance room because she remembered that he had setup traps there, as their final contingency. Survival instincts made people discover hidden talents and raise their concentration, and Yeonhee Woo thought fast and decided quickly.She did not go to the entrance because the trap had been for when everything else failed. However, she dared not open another door and ran along the wall.She ran into a corner and looked behind her with her bow raised with shaking hands. However, it was then she saw a message window.[You have completed the Quest \u2018One on One Combat.\u2019 Please decide who will receive the reward.]Another message popped up.[You have been distributed 1 point.][Declan Extermination: Exterminated Declan Soldier 28/60]Then, the first message popped up again.\\n[You have completed the quest \u2018Declan Extermination.\u2019][You have gained a Silver Box as your first-place reward.][You have gained 28 Strength points.][Strength: F(50)]I had no time to read the messages and focused on the one that followed her.[You have completed the Quest \u2018One on One Combat.\u2019 Please decide who will receive the reward.]That meant that Yeonhee Woo was still alive, as I would automatically receive the reward if she was dead. I walked with a limp and realized that the Adversity Overcomer had ended when I entered the first room. I could not see or feel anything as I fell to the ground. She should be in the entrance room, and the trap would have helped her survive. She may be shaking, traumatized and afraid. I could not speak despite a healer being over there, and my eyes dimmed.I thought it was blood at first, but it tasted of salt, not the metallic flavor of blood. Something wet was falling in drops on my face.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were serious for civilians but would take three days for us to recover. However, I knew what had happened to her from her wounds.\u201cYou survived.\u201dI flinched inside, as she was wounded because of me. While I had told her that everything was over if she had to fight a monster, I had forgotten how powerful survival instinct was for humans. She had survived a fight with a mutt, and I asked her to tell me how it went. She spoke like she did not want to remember, but her story was different from what I had expected.She had not used the trap at the entrance room, maybe out of fear, and had met one of the monsters that got past me. Yeonhee Woo said she shot it with an arrow between the eyes, but the problem had been afterward. The monster had charged her regardless, and they went down together. I sat up despite her restraints because she seemed like she needed me to say some things.\u201cYou did well. Your actions led to your survival.\u201dYeonhee Woo showed a faint and sad smile. I took off my bandages and saw that there was no more blood. She rolled them up and placed them in her backpack. She had gotten it back after killing the mutt.[You have completed the Quest \u2018One on One Combat.\u2019 Please decide who the first place is.]She seemed to be seeing the same message, and we agreed that I would take first place and she would take second.

I needed fifty more to raise my strength level from F to E, and if I could manage it, I would be able to go head-to-head with the mutts. It would become much easier to open the doors, and I could become a D class in Strength when using the Man Who Overcame Adversity. My strength could match the agility level I could increase with the insignia. So I desperately wanted something that increased my Strength.The Silver Box opened, and the message that popped up made me almost jump in joy.[You have gained 36 Strength points.][Strength: F(86)]I managed to get what I wanted, and now I only needed fourteen points to raise my Strength rank.

Fear was not always negative, as it was like pain. Pain was a survival instinct that notified us of injury. Fear warned us of danger. When I used the Man Who Overcame Adversity, I did not feel pain, which let me fight hard but left me in agony afterward.If someone with this skill joined a team with ill intentions, there would be bloodshed during boss fights. The Second Evil, who had been an attacker, had probably become strong so fast due to skills like these. She would have taken all the prizes, after the rest of her party died of wounds sustained in suicide attacks. It was distasteful that someone could control my mind.Yeonhee Woo was quiet, and her gaze towards me made me uncomfortable. She lowered her eyes, but I could read the pity in them.

It was laughable. The people in my past life had been curious about where our powers and the system had come from, but nothing good had come from obsessing over these questions. It only brought out fanatics like the Eight Virtues.\u201cDo you know what happens with random rewards?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cGetting something good makes you want more, and not getting something good makes you want to try again.

Twenty monsters were now three, and they would need to jump over the piles of corpses to attack me.[Yeonhee Woo used Physical Healing.][Your wounds heal by a little.]I hurdled the pile first, and the remaining three did not have a choice in facing me. I used my Iron Skin reinforced fist to punch one in the face and took care of the remaining two.\u201cClear.\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s face was stained with blood as she had to step over the corpses. While her face was in a grimace, her eyes were not closed since this was not the first time she had to do so. We circled the room and discovered that there were no doors. Yeonhee Woo confirmed our location on the map.\u201cWe have to go back to the first room.\u201dThere had been four doors in the first room. One opened into the corridor that led back to the room past the entrance, and one door led to another corridor that ended at the room we were in now. We had just finished clearing the rooms past the first door we had explored. The best-case scenario would have been to get to the boss room by the first route we had taken, but all we could do was to consider ourselves lucky that the clear had been short. Yeonhee Woo spoke again.\u201cWe have food and water for about two weeks left.\u201d (EN: I know, two backpacks provide four weeks worth of food and water?!)It took a day to clear a room. (EN: Considering the cooldowns for Odin\u2019s Wrath and the Man Who Overcame Adversity, that\u2019s good.)\u201cWe have to secure another Escape Insignia or complete the dungeon by then.\u201d\u201cWill we make it?\u201d\\nIt had been two weeks since we had come here, as I had prepared supplies for four weeks.***Yeonhee Woo could not be considered even a F class, as she only had three types of stats. One did not consider the traits or skills when calculating a hunter\u2019s class in my past life, as basic stats were considered more important. Even if one had high class skills and traits, they were useless if a hunter did not possess the minimum stats.Even hunters who possessed skills with divine names were also evaluated on their base stats, not their extremely powerful skills, but they were already powerful in the first place. Therefore, in my past life, a hunter was decided on the average of four stat categories, and healers were no exception.So, the two of us were trying to conquer a dungeon that needed at least five E class hunters, and Yeonhee Woo reminded me of that fact before the boss fight.\u201cThe boss monster will be powerful, right?\u201dIf I had not known what the boss monster was, this was suicide. However, this was the fourth time I had come here. I had barely survived the first attempt that the military forced me into, and it had been during my second time that I had seen the end of this dungeon. I had come here in a party of ten and fought with the surviving four over the rewards.\u201cWe need to be careful which door we open, as things may end before we even see the boss monster.\u201d\u201cWe need to be lucky, right?\u201d\u201cYes, follow me.\u201dI had to convince myself that our luck was good to keep moving forward, and Yeonhee Woo followed me wearing her backpack. We walked up to a certain door. The first corridor of the first route we had taken had been quiet, and the room past the corridor required a day, and for the room beyond the first room required five days. (EN: To await the cooldown for the Man Who Overcame Adversity, per the last chapter.)We had come back to the beginning of the first route, in front of the only remaining unopened door, and we and all of our clothes stank. We could only wipe our faces with a bit of water, as there was no water supply in the dungeon.\\n\u201cHow is your condition?\u201dYeonhee Woo looked desperate for a shower, but she nodded. While we came back from the first route, we had some rewards. I got an Escape Insignia from a dungeon box, and Yeonhee Woo had gained 8 stamina points from opening a Bronze Box. She now had twenty points, which meant she was an athlete now.\u201cLet\u2019s go back to the entrance room. We need to choose a new route.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s an unopened door remaining here.\u201dI was suspicious of that.\u201cThis door wasn\u2019t here before. This is probably a trap.\u201d\u201cCan I say something?\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cIt seems like the dungeon is trying to lure us away from this door, as it obviously looks like a trap.\u201d Yeonhee Woo looked away from my face for a moment, before resuming.\u201cYou know, if you\u2019re tired, how about you going back alone for a break, since you have an Escape Insignia? Your parents will be waiting for you to call.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re going to remain here in the dark alone?\u201d\u201cSince the alarms did not trigger, that means they\u2019re not roaming around, so wouldn\u2019t it be all right? I can do it.\u201d\\nMy heart still beat fast, but my mind grew calm.[You have used Iron Skin.][You have used Odin\u2019s Wrath.]I finished preparing, and if it was hell, either way, I will kill them all. I forgot about the concerns I had with the Bravery skill, and the monsters screamed louder when I roared, as I slashed into their flesh, or shattered their bones.***Yeonhee Woo thought Sunhoo was eating up his life to kill monsters. She had gone through much, and she had given up on thinking that things would become better many days ago. It was like that now. She saw limbs flying about, and corpses fall, but monsters desperate to kill Sunhoo still swarmed around him, frenetic and savage. It was like he was trying to survive in hell.Fear was natural like he had said, and that was why Yeonhee Woo could not understand Sunhoo\u2019s behavior. He had used fear and pain as his strength. It had been three weeks since they came here, and Yeonhee Woo was still struggling to survive while Sunhoo\u2019s eyes grew sharper. He continued to move and did not let his fears and terror stop him. As she could sense his emotions, Yeonhee Woo could not understand how he still had the Heart of a Lion.\u201cHow can he do that\u2026?\u201dShe waited for the man to survive, as he always had, and she needed to stay alive to heal him.Edited by Userunfriendly (EN: The whole path they took inside the dungeon, and the locations of the rooms, doors and corridors are confusing and messed up.

The results were the corpses in front of me.I had killed them all and still had two minutes remaining until the Man Who Overcame Adversity ended. Everything was perfect, except for the pain that will come after two minutes. I had killed the last spellcaster and I was deep in the room.

My thoughts ended there, and I convulsed in a bloody world while holding something small in my right hand.***I was in a bad mood having dreamt of the First Evil\u2019s face when I woke up. I hadn\u2019t thought much about his early days just because most of my memories are about him when he was powerful. I needed to search my memories about anecdotes regarding his childhood and youth, in hopes of providing more clues to the people I hired to find him. Yeonhee Woo was not there when I woke up, but I saw a precious bottle of water and painkillers where I could grab them.\\nShe was in the Treasure Room.\u201cSunhoo?\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s voice was surprised, and I walked up to where she could see me before sitting down.\u201cIt\u2019s not easy for me to walk around yet.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t move now.

You should have stayed in bed. I would have returned soon.\u201d\u201cThat would take too long.\u201dI tried standing up, and Yeonhee Woo supported me as if she could not help herself from aiding me. The passage was narrow, and I had to crawl in. I did not need to wait as she followed me in, and I reached out my hand when I approached the dungeon box.[Will you open the box?]\u201cYes.\u201d[The Man Who Overcame Adversity increases by 7.][Current level: F(7)]It took a bit to reach the second dungeon box, though the small cave it was in allowed me to stand.[You have been inflicted with the Fear Symptom (Gimlet)][Fear Symptom (Gimlet)\\n[Insignia: Speed-up (E) Escape (F)][Items: The Medal of Restraint (E) The Ring of the Blind (F)]While the status window was minimal compared to my past life, my growth rate was incomparable. I would defeat the boss monster and become stronger. She was looking at the empty bottles of water and a few empty cans of food while thinking things over. I stood up quietly, as there was only one door remaining. Yeonhee Woo followed me, and I muttered inwardly that the corridor would be empty. (EN: It looks like some time has passed. Obviously they\u2019re waiting out the cooldown for the Man Who Overcame Adversity, as they\u2019ve done several times already. This seems to be the biggest reason they\u2019ve had to spend weeks inside.)I opened the door and saw the empty corridor. I had told Yeonhee Woo that while the dungeon would be reset at random, there was a rule in how the corridors were arranged.The Treasure Room would always lead to an empty corridor that was connected to the boss room. Yeonhee Woo became quiet as a mouse in the corridor, and I was the same. We looked at it for a while before coming back.\u201cLet\u2019s eat first.\u201dWe did not say anything even after we finished eating. Time slowly passed by, and we held our breaths before going to sleep. We slept as much as we could, but I was still downcast.

I shook her awake, and she mumbled as she opened her eyes.\u201cI\u2019m ready.\u201d\u201cIf my plan works, things will end more quickly than before. You won\u2019t die because you can endure that instant, right?\u201dYeonhee Woo stood up after listening to my warnings, and we went down the corridor where we could hear only our footsteps. Has the corridor been this long all this time, or were we slow?We stood in front of the door, which was the same as other doors. However, it was more oppressive, and I could almost hear the boss monster\u2019s growl. While I knew how to defeat it, knowledge did not mean success. I just knew what not to do, as one mistake would lead to instant death. My heart drummed out a warning to return, but I nodded to Yeonhee Woo. She nodded in return, albeit awkwardly.[You have activated Odin\u2019s Wrath.][Target: The user.]My eyes widened, and I saw blue sparks. Sharp lines wrapped around my body and moved over my limbs.\u201cWe are entering the boss room.\u201dI could not have known what was ahead of me, as I threw myself inside the door.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, I knew how scary it could be as the monster stood on the platform at the middle of the room, standing at the highest point like a lord. The monster only looked at me, and while it looked like a tired old king, looks were deceiving.I had seen six E class hunters killed out of a party of ten because of that monster, and as the mutts rushed at me while it remained still, old memories flickered in my mind. Things had seemed easy before, and we had hunted the other mutts in this room mercilessly as they were like simple dumb animals. We had not realized that the boss monster became stronger by each killed mutt until it had changed into a demon.[You have used the Insignia \u2018Speed-up.\u2019][The Insignia \u2018Speed-up\u2019 has been removed.]I rushed at them while they were narrowing the distance, and while I had to go through them, there were too many. I had to create gaps, and I had used Odin\u2019s Wrath on my body to increase my speed.[You have used Iron Skin.]I could kill a mutt with a punch, but that was taboo since the old king would become enraged. The boss monster would become more and more furious at each one of its dead mutts and would turn into a berserk, vengeful king at the end. I shoved the mutt down by its shoulder, and I felt some pain in my leg as I jumped over it. The mutt must have scratched my leg, but I ignored it. Going to the platform through the mutts meant that I would need to watch my back as I am attacked from the front and sides.\\nThe fallen mutt would be leaping for my back, and I had no time to do something. I needed to reach the platform, but I could not kill any of the mutts. I kicked and shoved the mutts in my way aside, and then I saw the king ready himself in anticipation of my arrival. I saw a gap, but at that moment, I felt a shock on my back. I would have been sent flying if my strength level had not increased.I saw the monster\u2019s mouth ripping and tearing, and while kicking at another monster, I grabbed the mouth biting my shoulder, and pulled it off my body. I felt a burning pain as my flesh ripped away, but I could not assess my wound as I needed to find a gap to drive through. I looked around and found a spot where only one monster stood. It was there![Yeonhee Woo used Bravery.][Yeonhee Woo used Physical Healing.][Your wounds heal by a little.]She had used her skills as I had told her not to let me get out of her sight. She could see up to seven meters in the dark with Night Eyes, which meant I had only gone that far. I was moving as fast as I could, but time had slowed down for me. I had been kicking at a mutt when I saw the boss monster stand up.A mutt must have gone after Yeonhee Woo, and she must have succeeded in killing it.\\n[You have been distributed 1 point.]One of them went after her, and now she would have to kill more to protect her life. I had told her to survive in any way possible and keep me in sight when a monster came for her.***It was hard to aim for a certain point of a running target, especially when the shooter was terrified. However, Yeonhee Woo\u2019s arrow hit the monster between the eyes, and she darted behind the door to stand against the wall, as soon as she made the shot. She had her bow, but the mutt was too close. She took out a dagger and saw the monster\u2019s head that had come for her. She lunged without any hesitation, as fear gave her strength. She stabbed the mutt\u2019s neck, but the message did not appear then. She knew that the chest was the weak spot, but the mutt was lying face down. Blood gushed out of its cut throat with every heartbeat.She saw the kill message but could not immediately stand up. Her face was covered in blood, but she had no time for that. She had someone she needed to protect. After Yeonhee Woo rubbed the black blood all over her white exposed skin, she stood up and tried to ready her bow, because she was desperate. Her hand was shaking as she somehow managed to fit the arrow to her bow, and she moved from behind the door. She did not see anything but only heard screams in the dark. Yeonhee Woo took small and careful steps like a cat and saw the backs of many mutts. She was looking for Sunhoo, but there were so many monsters. It was then she saw his face for a moment, disappear, and appear again from the frenzied pile of mutts, tearing and biting into his flesh\u2026***I could only see the monsters\u2019 heads and hands, and I realized that I could power though only this far. The boss monster was still distant, but the mutts were everywhere. I used my left arm reinforced with Iron Armor to cover my eyes and my right hand on my abdomen. I could not let them have my eyes and major organs. I was enduring the pressure to take a step, and it seemed like I had been dropped in a world where countless swords stabbed and fire burned me.\\nI screamed and moved forward until I reached the slope. I pushed aside innumerous monsters and saw that I had seventy-five seconds left until the Man Who Overcame Adversity ended. I first needed to remove those in front of me who were desperate to protect their king.I used everything I had for the last effort, and it was then nothing stood between me and the boss monster. I unsheathed my dagger I had been saving for this, and the boss monster was too slow. I saw the dagger was deeply embedded in the monster\u2019s chest, and it was then I screamed Yeonhee Woo\u2019s name.[Yeonhee Woo used Marie\u2019s Hand.]I heard a woman\u2019s frenzied screaming, and my body began to move again. I saw the boss monster lying down, and I crushed both heads. Then, I saw the monsters gathered around the slope were being attracted to the smell of Yeonhee Woo\u2019s blood. I crushed the boss monster\u2019s chest and jumped down from the platform.[You have satisfied the conditions for the quest \u2018Sock and Buskin.\u2019 Please decide who the first place is.] (EN: Mentioned on Chapter 46.)I then rushed at Yeonhee Woo while killing every monster surrounding her before seeing her motionless body in a pool of blood.

I had to use up everything I had saved up to that time to heal, and just one hit had been almost fatal. If I didn\u2019t have a shock-absorbing insignia, I would have died then and there.I remembered that the Man Who Overcame Adversity had made the First Evil who he was. In my past life, it had been a sight when the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues had fought together for the first time. The First Evil would have died, but the Man Who Overcame Adversity had revived the First Evil so he could kill one of the Seven Demon Kings.The world was shocked, but even the First Evil had been afraid of the First Virtue. The reason was due to the First Virtue\u2019s main skill, the \u2018Devi\u2019s Knife.\u2019The day the world saw the Seven Demon Kings for the first time was carved into my memory, as it was the first time people knew that there were stronger boss monsters than S class ones, and the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues had revealed their true strength for the first time.I had watched the recordings of that fight, I memorized each and every moment of the footage, though it was fragmentary, and occasionally the screen filled with hissing static, created from the corona discharges from high level skills.When I saw the First Virtue there, I first thought that he had rebuilt his skills, as every one of them had been S class. One could have eight at the maximum for each category from traits to skills, and he must have filled his slots to the max.However, the number of his S class skills exceeded even this limit, and it took me a long time to guess that it was not due to skills from an item. Then, it took me even longer to find out that Devi\u2019s Knife was a skill with multiple effects.***Since I now had the Man Who Overcame Adversity AND Devi\u2019s Knife, I could only stare at the screen.[Devi\u2019s Knife (Skill)Effect: The user projects a sharp force.Class: F(0)\\nCooldown time: 5 minutes]While the skill was an F class, for now, I would know its true potential as the skill improved. I began to open other boxes, starting from the Gold Boxes.[You have gained 15 Strength points.][Strength: E(15)]While the number was low for a Gold Box, it was Strength again. Now, the second Gold Box.[The Man Who Overcame Adversity increases by 81.][The Man Who Overcame Adversity: F(89)]Now, the Diamond Box. As my stats were too low to receive the proper rewards of the box, it would give me something else.[Will you open the Diamond Box?]One could spend the rest of their lives opening Diamond Boxes in an S class dungeon. The box opened with radiant light.[You have received the item \u2018The Ruler\u2019s Ring.\u2019][The Ruler\u2019s Ring (Item)Effect: The user can control a monster of a lower class to fight for you. However, monsters designated for boss quests and One-on-One combat quests are excluded.]It was not bad, as this item had been sold at a high price in my previous life due to three reasons. First, the effect was like a summoning skill. Second, it could be given to others, and third, it immediately removed a monster from a fight.\\nI had opened all the boxes, and now I was going to open two Bronze Boxes and three Silver Boxes with my accumulated points.I received 4 Stamina points and 6 agility points from the Bronze Boxes. Now, for the Silver Boxes.[You have gained 22 Agility points.][You have received the item \u2018The Necklace of Vitality.\u2019][The Necklace of Vitality (Item)Effect: The user\u2019s stamina level is increased by one level temporarily.Class: EDuration: 5 minutesCooldown time: 6 days]I could use this until my Stamina level increased to E class. If I got a similar insignia, I could strengthen it.[You have received the Skill \u2018Earthquake.\u2019][Earthquake (Skill)Effect: The user shakes the surrounding area by a little.Class: F(0)\\nShe had gotten Agility points, skill points, and a new skill, which were satisfactory. However, I could not understand how she could move like she had the Man Who Overcame Adversity. Her rewards could not explain her current status.\u201cIt\u2019s time to go back, isn\u2019t it?\u201dSchool began two days from now, and Yeonhee Woo asked me to take her back.\u201cWon\u2019t it be better here?\u201d\u201cI want to go back.\u201d\u201cThe dungeon is completely destroyed, and that means the monsters will not come.\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s eyes widened.\u201cThat\u2019s a relief.\u201dHer gaze turned outside to the rural village that could be seen across the concrete walls. She spoke suddenly to ask me a question.\u201cI want to ask about the Revival trait.\u201dWhat was that? I had never heard of it, and Yeonhee Woo seemed to have noticed my confusion.\u201cWeren\u2019t you the first?

Yeonhee Woo had quick wits, she was quiet on the way to Seoul and did not ask again whether there were really others like us. When we returned to Seoul, she saw her unchanged rooms with deep emotion. However, she grabbed me as I was about to leave.\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201d***Yeonhee Woo was skilled in hiding her thoughts, which helped her in school that bustled with horny teenagers. She could fake indifference, and it was the same now. She asked me while hiding her emotions.\u201cWhat\u2019s next?\u201dI was surprised.\u201cLook at your wounds\u2026Let\u2019s talk about the contract money after you\u2019re healed.\u201d\u201cMoney!\u201d\u201cYes. I will transfer the money directly into your account so there won\u2019t be problems. Call me or come to my office when you\u2019re fully healed. I\u2019ll need your ID card and seal.\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s eyes turned to her room again, as Sunhoo had placed the TV remote and a pot of tea next to the blankets.\u2018He is a nice guy.\u2019She had first suspected that Sunhoo would be as ruthless and unfeeling inside as he was outside, but she was now certain after going through that dungeon together. Sunhoo was only cold when it was necessary for survival, and she understood that.Therefore, Yeonhee Woo could not understand his hidden rage. She firmly believed that he was not a person who could harbor anger that deep for so long.However, he was furious at the other Awakened beside her and Sunhoo. Yeonhee Woo had thought that if there were others who could help Sunhoo, things would not have been that\u2026horrific. Therefore, Yeonhee Woo wanted to ask Sunhoo whether she could search for the other Awakened. She had been saved by Sunhoo and wanted others to help them so it would not be so dangerous for him.However, Yeonhee Woo now knew she should not have asked that question.\\n***Ten days later, Yeonhee Woo was waiting for me in the office.\u201cYou\u2019re the same.\u201dShe smiled like she hadn\u2019t seen me in years. Yeonhee Woo was now returned to her usual self, and she turned around in front of me to show that her wounds had regenerated fully.I saw the fully prepared office with the major papers and printed private newsletters. It was like when we were going through the Russian War, as another war was brewing in Wall Street as the aftermath to that battle. Companies were now buying out the hedge funds and financial institutions that had gone down with Russia.\u201cYou\u2019re healed. That\u2019s nice. While I should congratulate you\u2026\u201d\u201cNo, go ahead and work. I will wait.\u201dI sat down at the table and looked over the papers Yeonhee Woo had prepared on the table. I then read an article.[Jonathan Investments confirms buying LTCM.]It was amusing to see that our New York firm could now compete with Silverman and Morgan now, as it would have been impossible in the past. However, Jonathan Investments had grown that much during the Russian war, and we had ninety billion dollars to prove it. I then went to the safe to take out the file that I had prepared for Yeonhee Woo. The file was her blood money, money she had bled for.\u201cCheck it. I will find another way if you don\u2019t like it.\u201dYeonhee Woo spoke after reading all the documents carefully.\u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\u201cYou want money?\u201d\u201cNo, this is way too much. The land, the building, and the medical equipment.\u201d\\nI had given her the Hwasung hospital building in its entirety. The hospital was worth much more than the two billion won I had promised to give her, and she was talking about that.\u201cI used the hospital to disguise the dungeon. It\u2019s useless to me now after the dungeon has been destroyed, but maybe it is not for you.\u201dYeonhee Woo\u2019s payroll was not small, but most of her money was going somewhere else. She had been giving away eighty percent of her salary, and it seemed to be related to her history and her empathic senses.\u201cHow did you know?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dI did not respond to that, as I could not say I had searched her room multiple times. I changed the subject, and asked her a question instead. (EN: I think Yeonhee Woo detected Sun\u2019s unspoken question about what she did with her money. Yep, empaths are scary. x_x )\u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201d\u201cI may lose it all. I have never handled something like this, and this is a hospital.\u201dHowever, Yeonhee Woo\u2019s eyes shone as she looked at the file.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be a doctor, but you just need to hire them. You can use this doctor\u2019s license to maintain the hospital.\u201d\u201cWho is this guy? Jinwon Yang?\u201dYeonhee Woo spoke as she looked over the copy of the doctor\u2019s license. I had moved all of the hospital licensing paperwork under that name and the land and building ownership to Yeonhee Woo. She was now the owner.\u201cTurn it over.\u201dYeonhee Woo saw the bank account number.\u201cSend five million won there each month if you want to maintain the hospital.\u201d\\n\u201cCan I manage this as I want?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s yours.\u201d\u201cCan this be nonprofit?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how you will maintain the hospital but do as you wish.\u201dYeonhee Woo just wanted to help those in need. While hospitals needed to make a profit, there were other ways to structure a nonprofit system. I did not need to explain further, and Yeonhee Woo gratefully took the bankbook.\u201cDo you still want to go to the next dungeon?\u201d I asked.\u201cHow about you?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cWill you go on in dungeons with or without me?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t think about me.\u201d\u201cI need to make more money to manage a hospital.\u201dYeonhee Woo stared at the documents.\u201cSo, you will do this for money?\u201dHer smile was bright as she nodded.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was the fear of a global financial crisis and an American President faced possible impeachment due to a sex scandal. Korea was also tense due to friction with North Korea. The airport wasn\u2019t particularly busy, as Jessica arrived from New York, and not as you\u2019d expect, London.She caught other peoples\u2019 attention due to her beauty as she walked by them.\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time, Ethan.\u201dThe airport restaurant was almost empty, and the place seemed to say that it will close soon. Jessica started smoking a cigarette, and I also lit one that I bummed from her. Jessica opened her mouth again.\u201cI wanted to see you, but I did not expect we would meet in Korea.\u201d\u201cThe Russia War and the Wall Street buyouts all began here.\u201d\u201cKorea could have been an attractive market before Jeonil came in and became \u2018friendly\u2019 with the current government.

Ethan, why are you here?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s not talk about me.\u201d\u201cI was trying to lighten the mood since the restaurant is so empty. I apologize.\u201d\u201cHowever, it\u2019s quiet and the perfect place to talk.\u201dJessica nodded with a smile, and I asked a question.\u201cHow was New York?\u201dShe brightened as she spoke.\u201cEveryone wanted to work in Wall Street and get hired by those prestigious names, the ones with history and impeccable reputations. In the beginning, I could hardly believe we were going to go against them. When I saw their desperation during the buyout meetings, it was an amazing experience.\u201dJessica was talking about the near-bankrupt hedge funds and financial institutions.\\n\u201cDo you know that one of the funds we bought was founded by the economic advisor of a former president?\u201d\u201cLandmark Capital?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dJessica\u2019s eyes deepened as she seemed to be thinking of the financial battles that had happened over the past few months. While she had not risked her life in a dungeon like Yeonhee Woo, it would have been meaningful days for her. The battles she fought would have opened her eyes, and she would want to see more.I decided that her apprenticeship had ended because of an email Jillian had sent me last month regarding what he could have done more during this battle. He said that Jessica had independently come up with those same points.\u201cLet\u2019s talk about us. Jillian said that he wanted you to head a desk team.\u201d\u201cPlease don\u2019t say that.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cI just made some lucky guesses. There\u2019s all the difference in the world between making guesses and actually putting down hard cold cash on those guesses. You haven\u2019t sent the report to them, right?\u201d\u201cThem?\u201d \u201cThose Geniuses who wrote the investment proposal. They would just laugh. Who are they? I cannot forget the shock I felt when I read the proposal. I couldn\u2019t sleep for days.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re talking about this, right?\u201dI took out a new investment proposal, and Jessica barely managed to stop herself from grabbing it.\u201cYou can see it, as I brought it for that purpose.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201dWhile her eyes burned with joy, she did not reach for the proposal.\u201cI do not know how much Jillian exaggerated, but your clients are making a mistake. Jillian said, \u2018All that we learned in school, and on the trading floor, is useless for this battle\u2019, and I agree.\u201d\\nJessica was smart, as she knew what reading the proposal directly meant.\u201cI have to study under Jillian still.\u201d\u201cYou differ from his opinions.\u201d\u201cNo, I meant I cannot leave the Isle of Man. I have to learn so much from him. I was only a phone secretary a few months ago, and\u2026Ethan, I\u2019m not misunderstanding things, right?\u201d \u201cMy clients and I agree with Jillian, but we cannot force you. Will you listen to our offer?\u201d***The funds in the Isle of Man were used for the Wall Street buyouts, and the firm had bought three major hedge funds, including Landmark Capital. Out of the three, two had given up their portfolios, databases, and client funds. However, Landmark Capital had managed to save a small partnership. They used their bankruptcy as an investment method, and New York and Isle of Man were looking for firms that were run by clever people like that.Some losers received government buyouts, while others managed to make a profit. Others lost everything they had to us. Wall Street was like that now.\u201cOur clients want a Global Property Management Firm at this time.\u201dJessica was not surprised, as she would have had expected such an outcome from the order to be aggressive in buyouts.\u201cThe buyouts are only the beginning. Not only independent hedge funds but investment institutions with various funds are now undergoing negotiation.\u201d I began.\u201cI know that.\u201d\u201cTherefore, we will tie some of them to a group the size of Bluestone.\u201d\u201cYou know that Jonathan Investments are going through the same process?\u201d\u201cI am the one who got the Isle of Man and New York talking. I guess you have not heard that.\u201d\u201cIs that so?\u201d\u201cJonathan Investments has also emerged victorious, and they would have massive amounts of cash. We should not compete with them since we\u2019re in a similar situation. Both Jonathan Investments and we are the winners, and it would be stupid to risk our winnings fighting each other.\u201d (EN: Remember, the staff at New York (Jonathan Investments) AND Isle of Man are unaware they\u2019re both owned by Jonathan and Sun. This was deliberately setup by Sun. ^_^ )\\n\u201cIs there more?\u201d\u201cWhat do you want, Jessica? For America to crumble?\u201d\u201cHow much money will I manage?\u201d\u201cTwice of the original Isle of Man funds.\u201dJessica\u2019s face went rigid at those words.\u201cThirty billion dollars\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a large amount, but not that much of a challenge.\u201dJessica nodded.\u201cThe rules are the same. You will not be responsible for losing money if you follow the proposal.\u201d\u201cI just need to buy and press down prices.\u201d\u201cYou will also need to head over a hundred elite managers. What will you do, Jessica?\u201dShe did not hesitate.\u201cI\u2019ll stay.\u201d***The new investment proposal was simple, as it only said to buy the major IT stocks in the New York NASDAQ.

They managed to gather up the best of the talented developers who were out of jobs because the bubble broke, and their companies went out of business. The Wall Street situation was similar, because after Russia, Jonathon scooped up the best of the talented managers, funds, and support staff for the New York firm. The result was that the New York firm emerged the victor in the buyout battle. (EN: Yes, Googol. Let\u2019s not get the author sued for trademark infringement. ^_^ ) (EN: Yep, Sun drove their original firms to bankruptcy, and scooped up all the best talents. Yes, he is indeed evil. ^_^ )***In the winter of 1998, there was a Christmas tree in front of the company\u2019s main building. I couldn\u2019t help but think \u2018how appropriate\u2019. In a typical household that celebrates Christmas, at the bottom of the X-mas tree are all the presents stacked for the family, waiting for the anticipated morning. And our competitors, excuse me, former (now bankrupt) competitors gave us SO many presents this year! Jonathan asked me a question.\u201cWhat happened to school?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m on vacation.\u201dJonathan greeted me with a smile, and his office was filled with documents.\u201cCheck this out first.\u201dIt was the board member list of the New York firm, and it was filled with names that could host a global financial conference. He seemed to have aged during the past few months, completing the list must have been taxing. Jonathan seemed sick and tired of the list. However, I could see the fire in his eyes as I had anticipated.\u201cThe firm name will stay, as those on the list were gushing about the brand power of my name. The losers will always flatter the winners with their words.\u201d (EN: It seems the list includes names they poached from the losing hedge funds and businesses.)\u201cWe\u2019re on the same boat now.\u201d\u201cNo, they\u2019re on our boat. They\u2019re just failures.\u201dI could feel Wall Street oozing out of him with each word, as the board members must have stressed him out during the negotiations.\u201cThis firm is now bigger than the two of us, and we need as many good sailors as we can get.\u201d\u201cI can only act like this in front of you. Why don\u2019t we go out? It\u2019s snowing and going to get colder.\u201dSnow was falling, and we intentionally went out of Wall Street to avoid people and went to a small whiskey bar in a secluded street. There were not many customers, and I could hear jazz music. This was better than a bottle of wine that cost ten thousand dollars.\\n\u201cYou\u2019re not going to act like a child here, right Ethan?\u201dJonathan spoke one of my major aliases as he poured me whisky.\u201cJillian doesn\u2019t know anything, right?\u201dI nodded.\u201cYou\u2019re not going to tell him?\u201d \u201cNever.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s drink first.\u201dThe whiskey was strong, and it seemed that Jonathan was going to drink his stress away with it. His eyes became more comfortable after a drink, and he asked me with a faint smile.\u201cThe best thing we did was to bring in the Connecticut Retiree Teacher\u2019s pension, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d (EN: Chapter 37.)We more than tripled those funds, and the relevant government departments would have looked on us with great favor. Not only American government officials but officials from other countries were contacting us while observing our buyouts. When we finished, the offers began to come in, and the total was 400 billion dollars so far. (EN: I\u2019m sorry if it seems that I\u2019m going nutters on the Editor\u2019s Notes in this chapter, but I need to point this out. While Sun and Jonathan\u2019s private fortunes were ridiculously large by this time, over half a trillion dollars, their real power in the financial world is the vast funds they managed for their clients. They CONTROLLED trillions in client funds, and as long as they made money for their clients, they could move those funds as they wished. )\u201cThe board members won\u2019t have a day off from now on.\u201dJonathan\u2019s smile was bitter, as he also knew that giving them work for the rest of their lives was also a form of success. The New York firm alone controlled enough funds to affect the global market, and the whiskey was a small celebration for that fact. When the bottle of whiskey was halfway gone, we were looking over the next investment proposal now.\u201cWill the hedge funds under us move?\u201d\u201cNo, let them be. They\u2019ll be pouncing on internet startups soon by themselves anyway.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d\\nThere were hints already from 1995, and soon, everyone will bet insane amounts of money on Internet Startups.\u201cWe will not intervene on that or the pension funds.

He became quiet and pulled out his phone.\u201cI have a partner, and may I talk things over with him?\u201dHe was thinking critically about Jonathan\u2019s offer, which was a good sign.\u201cI have to go to Washington in an hour. Can you do so in ten minutes?\u201d\\n\u201cI\u2019ll be back.\u201dThe man went out and came back with an excited face. The contract and the check were already ready on the table.\u201cWe had a difference of opinion, and my partner believes our technology is worth more than five million. Do you want to rethink your offer?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t need to. Have you read my book?\u201d\u201cYes. My partner was disappointed not being able to meet you and he said many times that we should trust our funds to your company if we sold it.\u201d\u201cThen you will know I have bet my entire personal assets twice, just on my instincts, and won big, and I believe that this would be my third opportunity.\u201dJonathan ripped up the check and wrote one for ten million dollars.\u201cI believe that your partner will be satisfied.\u201dI saw his surprised eyes and shaking hands, but when the tremors died down, he looked determined. I knew then what he was thinking.\u201cI thank you for your high estimate of our technology.\u201d\u201cYou have changed your mind.\u201dWhile Jonathan was smiling, his voice now grew cold. He spoke while the man stood, which made him sit down again.\u201cI made a bet with the banks after hitting two jackpots, and it was an utterly insane gamble. However, I had been certain that I would win, because I trusted myself, and you know the results.\u201dJonathan\u2019s voice grew heavier, and the room\u2019s atmosphere became oppressive.\u201cPeople again laughed at me for betting against Russia, but I trusted my hunches.\u201d\u201cI know about the Russian finance war.\u201d \u201cYou may not know this, but I bought a billion dollars in Russian bonds just to fool my opposition, and lull them to fall into my trap.\u201d\\n\u201cWall Street knows me and also knows if I believe in you, I will trust my instincts and I will invest, up to everything I have on you, your partner, and your technology. I will go all in.\u201dIt was time to finish, and I counted inwardly up to three.\u201cYou and your partner will have to come back here, and we can start the paperwork.\u201d\u201cI cannot believe this is happening\u2026why are you doing this when you\u2019re you?\u201dJonathan only opened the door, and it was then the man grabbed the check. I could see that the man had come to a final decision.\u201cI am trying to set this up in the best way possible. Fifty-fifty, but my partner and I get management authority.\u201dHe then lifted his arm for a handshake to Jonathan, and Jonathan waited for a little bit until the man spoke again.\u201cYou have to negotiate this much if you really value our technology.\u201dIt was then Jonathan spoke.\u201cI had to know one thing before betting everything on you and your technology. By ripping up the 10 million dollar check, it told me you believed in yourselves and your technology. I had to know that. However, I do apologize for being rude today.\u201d\u201cSo do I.\u201dThey then shook hands, and the man looked like he was about to faint.\u201cYou won\u2019t regret this.\u201dAs he said those words, Jonathan looked at me. I could see the person he had been in his past life there.Edited by UserunfriendlyPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I am certain of PageRank technology in its searching methods. I request two things from you.\u201d\\nJonathan paused for a moment before going on with his explanation.\u201cFirst, keep developing the basic algorithm, and there should be mutual agreements about mergers. If you agree with these two points, you can move forward in building your new firm as you think best.\u201d (EN: An Algorithm is a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.)All the documents had been prepared in advance, and the man seemed to have lost his fear as he talked about the company\u2019s vision. The contract is now finished.\u201cYou will celebrate with your partner on becoming millionaires?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201d\u201cWait a bit, as I would like to join you. I also want to meet your partner. Will that be acceptable?\u201d\u201cYes. I cannot wait to tell my partner this news.\u201dThe man went out of the office with a smile, but Jonathan lost his when he was gone.\u201cI cannot believe this. He had been about to refuse all that money. Geeks will be geeks\u2026\u201dHistory changed again, and Googol will start in a regular office in Silicon Valley instead of in a garage. Also, they would begin hiring people they wanted now instead of when the dot-com bubble broke. While they would not show sudden growth at present, when the other puzzle pieces such as the change of marketing from television to the internet arrived, things would explode quickly.Jonathan stared at me as he spoke.\u201cThings have been like this since you sent me Brian Kim.\u201dI took out a bankbook and a password written on paper.\\n\u201cUnicorn Corporation?\u201dJonathan asked me as he checked the bankbook. As the company had succeeded in making a legendary profit rate in the Russian finance war, the firm could now buy another IT firm that had been put off until now. Unicorn dealt in software and data.\u201cSince IT will go crazy soon, we have to secure Predict in any way possible under Jonathan Investment\u2019s name.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t make the board members do this, so you\u2019re asking me to make the deal, in person, but under this firm\u2019s name.\u201d Jonathan held up my password and the bankbook.\u201cYou have friends.\u201d\u201cYou give me more work, but more money.\u201dJonathan stood up with a smile and wore his coat. He needed to go now if he wanted to be in time for Washington, and I could see his secretary\u2019s shadow outside.\u201cWe should continue what we started yesterday, Sun. You won\u2019t chicken out, right?\u201d\u201cJust go.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t want to. I already know what they\u2019ll say and how they will look at me.\u201dThe Secretary of the Treasury hoped to influence, or if necessary, intimate Jonathan Investments as we now managed over 500 billion dollars. I heard a knock from his secretary.\u201cThe board members have already left, and it is now time, sir.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m almost ready. See? I\u2019m wearing my coat.\u201d\\nJonathan spoke again after waiting for the door to shut.\u201cThe government does not want us to start a bank. They\u2019re just being cowards when we have not even said a single word.\u201dHe stared at me, and while I had not mentioned anything to him, he seemed to know what I had wanted for a long time. Jonathan waited for a long time before adding a word.\u201cWe can be aggressive now. What do you want me to do?\u201dNow was not the time.\u201cThe Secretary will make some offer first, to sweeten the deal, so just get the pension funds. As cheap as you can, and without commitments, but I don\u2019t need to remind you of that.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know how far you see, but things are beginning to get interesting now. Don\u2019t forget about tonight. I\u2019ll be angry if you go to Seoul.\u201d***The snow began to fall harder, and I wondered where that guy would be now. I was thinking of the First Evil and wondered if he had been a psychopath from the very beginning. I was looking for him due to that reason, but I had not found him yet. I visited the private investigating firm I had hired, and John of the ZOPI group seemed to have been waiting for me. He would be, as I was his biggest client.\u201cWe have sent you 1500 pictures.\u201dHe then explained how much they had done, and I agreed that they had been doing everything they could except one. Actually finding that evil SOB.\u201cI think he may have gone down a bad path. The boy does not have parents or siblings.\u201d I mused, remembering what everyone had \u201cknown\u201d about that sicko.\u201cHowever, Juvenile prison is out of bounds for us, as our group cannot access the court database.\u201d\\n\u201cWhile ZOPI and other groups cannot go outside the law to access the court files\u2026\u201d\u201cI see why you want to meet my boss.\u201d\u201cYes, I want to explain the services I can provide in detail.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t need to meet him. I have enough discretion in situations like this. I know what you\u2019re saying.\u201dThe man wanted to go solo and earn a sponsor with money. Who would not when seeing all the money flowing out of Wall Street? I knew a man like him would do anything for money.\u201cYou just became one of us working here.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll take that as a compliment.\u201dHe was betting his career and his job, as he could win big but lose everything if I refused his offer and notified ZOPI.\u201cCan I expect other services?\u201dJohn said yes outright.\u201cWhen that situation arrives, you will have to nullify your contract with ZOPI. Please bring the papers.\u201dJohn seemed ecstatic, like he had gotten everything.\u201cGive me a budget as soon as you can. Use as much as you need for special fees.\u201dWall Street was special, an endless cornucopia of money, enough to make someone like John offer to break the law if necessary.\u201cLet\u2019s get to work, John.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The ZOPI Group tended to speak of this project first when they wished to advertise their company to new customers. A well-known bank had asked for the investigation of a large distribution company. The bank had owned most of the shares in the firm and wanted to know if their money was safe.\\nIt had been John Clarke\u2019s first project after coming to ZOPI, but to him, real battlefields, complete with guns and bombs, were easier than this. His rifle was a pen, his squad his workstation, and his air support was a team of forensic accountants. He hated it. Still, while he could manage to do the work somehow with the accountants ZOPI had assigned him, he could not endure what happened after he succeeded in completing the project.While the accountants and the ZOPI group\u2019s board members all praised him, John could not abide that he had saved billions of dollars for the company for the truly paltry and insulting remuneration of a few thousand dollars. He had used illegal and legal means to complete the project, and he sincerely regretted becoming a civilian investigator for Wall Street when private military firms had tried to recruit him.He had been looking for a chance to go solo for the last two years or just give up and go into the private military sector if things did not get better. However, he had remained in Wall Street because of the billions of dollars that came with the requests here. While the money belonged to the clients, John Clarke often dreamed that he would be able to own such wealth someday.Things had been like that when he had first met Ethan, who looked young like Asians tended to be. He introduced himself as having come from the Cayman Islands. He looked formidable like he had experienced both Wall Street and the battlefield. That was why John thought at first Ethan was the same as him and envied Ethan for working under a legit billionaire. What was more, Ethan\u2019s firm was using billions to find a person, which enriched ZOPI and the companies ZOPI contracted to expand the search.John did not believe that Ethan was looking for a trustee, but that was not important as long as it served as a reason. Money was, after all, money, and ZOPI backed John as much as it could. Things were looking up for the Back Alleys of Wall Street, and John Clarke was shocked that a single person had changed everything. (EN: Chapter 40. The Back Alleys of Wall Street refers to the \u201csemi\u201d legal firms that handled offshore tax-haven accounts and private investigators.)That was why John did everything to the best he could, so he could show his capacity to Ethan\u2019s boss. Rich people needed people like him. A good investigator like John would happily jump ship to become an employee for a billionaire. While he would be used as a dog, money was better than pride.However, good fortune had finally come for him when he met Ethan again, and when John decided to take a chance.\u201cIt ended up like that.\u201dJohn Clarke spoke to a muscular man having a drink with him, who now asked him a question.\u201cWhile I\u2019m grateful for the money, will it be dangerous?\u201d\u201cDangerous\u2026\u201d\u201cYou know how that guy Smith died. Rich people treat us like we\u2019re expendable, and disposable if we know too much.\u201d\u201cHaven\u2019t you listened to me?\u201d\u201cI know that the pay will be a problem. We\u2019re not first-rate, so how much?\u201dJohn Clarke smiled faintly, and the man knew something big was coming. He had served John Clarke in the Gulf War, and that smile meant something good.\u201cA blank check.\u201d\\n\u201cThere\u2019s a limit?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cCome on, give me the restrictions.\u201d\u201cNothing, if we find the guy.\u201dThe man was flabbergasted.\u201cWhat\u2019s the guy made of? Diamonds?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know and don\u2019t want to know. I don\u2019t want to become like Smith.\u201d\u201cThings won\u2019t end there, right?\u201d\u201cThe ending is obvious, but who needs a reason when the money is this good?\u201d\u201cHow far will things go?\u201d\u201cThe same, as everyone, including the client, is pretending we\u2019re searching for a trustee, but you know that\u2019s not it.\u201d\u201cThe rich will be the rich. So, we\u2019ll be the ones cleaning up afterward?\u201d (EN: Yep, they figured out that this will end with the target\u2019s death. But they don\u2019t care, with the blank check. )\u201cLike always. So how about it?\u201d\u201cThe boy being young irks me.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll be searching prisons, orphanages, and gangs first.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s a wild one?\u201d\\n\u201cI looked for a normal kid, but nada. Zip. The client told me that the boy will already be as big as us and that age will be only a number.\u201d\u201cI cannot believe the money going into finding that boy. How did you stop yourself from asking questions?\u201d\u201cAre you in?\u201d\u201cWhat tattoos do I need this time?\u201dThe man showed his arm, and the Marine Corps tattoo was covered with dirty scars.\u201cYou\u2019re the same as always.\u201dThe man smiled at John Clarke\u2019s response.\u201cHere\u2019s a list of the other guys to recruit.\u201dJohn Clarke began to show documents to the man, who looked them over.\u201cI see those I miss and those I want to kill.\u201d\u201cCall them all, and for the guys we can\u2019t use, just give a few bucks to the ones who are junkies or invalids.\u201d\u201cHow about you?\u201d\u201cI got this much just asking around as a private investigator.\u201dJohn Clarke showed the man a notebook with the list of corrupt government officials.\u201cThey\u2019ve got their hands outstretched for bribes, and we\u2019ll start from here.\u201d***\\n\u201cDo you have a mask?\u201dI got into their car instead of Jonathan\u2019s sedan, which I had been using in New York, and everyone else was silent except for John.\u201cWhere in Brooklyn?\u201d\u201cBrownsville.\u201dIt was southeast Brooklyn and one of the poorest New York districts.\u201cCan you make contact with the guys onsite?\u201d\u201cWe can\u2026\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t repeat myself from now on, just answer my questions.\u201dMy heart was racing, and my hands were shaking. My voice quivered as I spoke.\u201cIf not, say so. I can call others.\u201dJohn Clarke looked at me, and his eyes grew indifferent as he opened his mouth.\u201cWe can.\u201dJohn sent a look at the men in the back as I answered.\u201cTell the force that they have to avoid detection and contact with the target at all costs.

I saw the Brooklyn Bridge out the window.\u201cGun.\u201dJohn immediately handed me a compact German pistol, and I released the magazine and confirmed the chamber was empty before reinserting the magazine and racking the slide, chambering a live round. I made sure the safety was fully engaged before screwing in the long silencer. The sleek pistol didn\u2019t use a tilting-barrel action, like the Glock, so there were no reliability issues with an attached silencer. \u00a0John Clarke obviously knew his firearms.\u201cI will tell you what to do. Only I will enter the building, and you guys will pull back. Also, you will be immediately paid after this job is done, but if you want to earn more money\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you want us to do?\u201d\u201cYou and another one come with me, and others will wait around the building and prepare in case we fail.\u201dI could not underestimate him at any cost. There were so many variables because I had no way of knowing his specs. His powers had been famous from the beginning, and his growth rate was faster than any other hunter.I had to finish this before he became stronger, and today was the day.\u201cHow much are we allowed?\u201d\u201cYou can kill.\u201d\\nEveryone was calm like they had expected this, and all of them just checked their firearms.\u201cHe was judged not-guilty, and if we have to go to court, we will need to memorize the same stories, to credibly claim self defense. Also\u2026\u201dJohn Clarke was looking in the back mirror and spoke like he was confessing, reassuring the operative who was thinking out loud.\u201cIf you have no one to go with you to court, we will provide someone.\u201d\u201cWho is it?\u201dI heard a voice saying he would go to court with anyone who needed his help, and I assessed that they had prepared realistically for situations like this. \u00a0The voice was not a lawyer. Anyway, he\u2019d be unable to represent any member of the team if they got arrested, as he was at the scene of the incident. \u00a0No, these men were used to operating outside of the law, and they were completely unprepared for the criminal justice system. \u00a0The voice would help them with their stories, and remind them of the massive bonus they would get if they kept their mouths shut. \u00a0They would also serve as contacts between any caught operatives and John Clarke.\u201cYour name?\u201d\u201cCall me Tiboy.\u201d\u201cThen you, John, and I will go and do not underestimate him because he is young. If things go well, you will get rewards beyond your expectations, but the opposite is also true.\u201d \u00a0I picked the most relaxed of the operatives in the car, as he seemed best prepared, along with John of course.My warning was sincere, as this was like the contract I had given to Yeonhee Woo. No one would believe how dangerous the First Evil was, so I did not refuse their offer to help. I heard the sound of firearms clicking, as safeties were disengaged, and their silent tension felt good. They all were focused on the mission rather than themselves, and we were heading to the battlefield.We parked near an alley, and it seemed that the spot had been decided before as a man approached the driver\u2019s side window.\\n\u201cThe cat is in the house.\u201dHe then focused on his earphone and added that the First Evil was writing something on a desk.\u201cEveryone waits in ambush around the building except for the observer, and we kill the cat if it escapes.\u201dJohn handed me an earphone after issuing his order, and we got out of the car after putting on masks. We had removed the car license plates and anything else that may reveal our identity, but the reason was not what John Clarke would be thinking of.They would be thinking of getting caught by the authorities, but I was thinking of if the mission failed. If the First Evil escaped, he must not know who ambushed him. I went in front, as I had already been briefed about the building structure, and he was in an old house he rented monthly. John and Tiboy followed me, and I saw scenes from the atrocities he had committed in his previous life, which I did not want to remember.I had a chance to end all of them today, and even if he had not done them yet, it was much better to prevent all of them. When we were about to enter the third floor, where the First Evil was, I exchanged glances with the two veterans.John also had a pistol equipped with a silencer and waited for my orders. I said with my eyes that he should not shoot through the door, as we had to make absolutely sure of the kill.Johan looked at me in surprise as I turned the locked doorknob with my bare hand, and I sheared the steel bolts holding the door locked by simply rotating the knob with E rank strength, quieter than using a wrecking bar or sledgehammer, and faster than picking the lock. We were in, and we quietly entered his nest.The First Evil could not abide a mess even now, as the old house was neatly organized.<The cat has gone into the bathroom attached to the master bedroom, and we cannot see whether the bathroom door is open. We can hear the water flow.>We were guided by a man observing from the same floor of the opposing residence. The bedroom door was open, and I only could see a bare bed and documents and paper on the table.However, the sound of water running was loud to my ears, and while there was the possibility that his neat freak tendencies may make him take a shower in the middle of writing something, the timing was too coincidental.\\nI took out something from my coat, and blue sparks flashed.[You have used Odin\u2019s Wrath.][Target: A survival knife from a New York store.]It took me three steps to reach him and stab him in the neck, and I met his eyes for a moment. His cold eyes told me that he had memorized my eyes. I felt that my blade was being blocked, and a power I could not endure with an E class strength came out from his body.[The effect of Odin\u2019s Wrath has been forcefully cancelled.]Only the knife\u2019s handle remained, the blade melted trying to attack his barrier, and I saw that he had two insignias visibly imprinted on his exposed skin. I knew what they were, and they were for Area Control and Teleport!My items were of a lower rank, so I could not use anything, and I just punched him in the nose with all of my anger. His chin broke, and an eyeball burst as the barrier had completely gone down. It was then he used his hand to block my second punch, as he now could use his Man Who Overcame Adversity.That meant he was near death, but he stared at me like a predator with his remaining eye. It seemed like he would not use his teleport insignia yet, as he still had something to say.\u201cI found you again.\u201dThose were his first words to me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, I could not let go of the deathgrip I had on his hair.[You have used Gaia\u2019s Will.]The punch was like a blade in my stomach, and I endured the pain with clenched teeth. I then yanked his head down to the floor, and his head slammed against the tiles. I now had a free hand and used it to punch his neck, and I felt his spine crumble. When I was about to land the final hit, I fell down on broken concrete. The first evil had disappeared after using the F class Teleportation insignia.\u201cWho the F&amp;ck are you?\u201dThe black man had to be a lower floor resident, and he had come rushing into his bathroom at the noise. Since I had a mask on, he had come in with a baseball bat while yelling what would probably be the names of his family members, to stay in their rooms. I then saw two other masked faces looking down from the hole in the ceiling above me and shouted my orders.\u201cHe couldn\u2019t have gone more than a twenty-meter radius. One of you go to the rooftop while the other goes to the basement. I will go to the street. Hurry!\u201dI stood up with my hand on my stomach as the pain was spreading. I then threw a wad of hundred-dollar bills to the owner.\u201cIt\u2019s yours if you keep silent. Out of my way.\u201dMy body was heavy as the poison spread through it. The man plastered himself on the wall as I walked by, and while I saw several people, probably the homeowner\u2019s family, as I walked through the living room, they dared not approach me.Some neighbors had come out to check on an unconscious agent outside the villa. When someone had been about to remove his mask, another masked man came running to take him away. People stepped back when they saw blood, which was the last I saw of them since I had to check the nearby streets, despite being nearly sure he had gotten away.\\n**Others were still searching, and only John Clarke was waiting for me. We both had our masks down, as we could not stay masked in front of the police. Now, the First Evil\u2019s Adversity Overcomer effect would have ended.\u201c\u2026What are you guys?\u201dHe was trying to stay calm but looked haunted. I ignored his question.\u201cHow many men can you call immediately?\u201d\u201cThirty.\u201dHis voice was small and looked like he was about to break.\u201cIt\u2019s not enough.\u201d\u201cI can bring in non-combatants.\u201dHe flinched as I raised an arm, but I only placed it on his shoulder.\u201cHe will likely be unconscious somewhere and increase the search radius to the distance where one can go in five minutes by car. Search all stores, hospitals, and residential areas.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\\nWe spent the night searching for the First Evil. The next day, I saw strange men who wore street clothes but had bulk and wore comfortable shoes. They walked in two\u2019s and looked exactly like street cops. They eyed me with suspicion.On the one hand, the poison had stopped spreading in my chest. While I could not move well, it would disappear over time. I had gone to where John Clarke had given me the address, and it was an old house with a small yard. He explained the place to me.\u201cWe\u2019re using this as our temporary headquarters.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s eat first. Do you have anything?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWe went to the house, and it looked like it had been abandoned for a long time. A man was standing there, and I saw that it was Tiboy. He gulped at seeing me. While all of them had violence in their daily lives, what they had seen yesterday was from another world. The First Evil had only stumbled after being shot multiple times with three guns.I saw fake ID cards on the table, ranging from the FBI, DEA to government institutions like the Internal Revenue Service. John\u2019s people were fast. We ate simply in silence, and I moved to the room where they had placed the dead body. I knew that he died from a simple punch by the First Evil. The corpse\u2019s eyes were wide open in shock, as we had been too late. I asked John some questions after covering the corpse.\u201cWhat is his name?\u201d\u201cBrown.\u201d\u201cDoes he have a family?\u201dJohn Clarke waited for Tiboy to answer, and he did so with hesitation.\u201cHe has a daughter, who his divorced wife left behind.\u201dI nodded.\\n\u201cForget what you had seen before, as guns should work next time. However, you will need a more focused and if necessary, explosive methods than before if I\u2019m not there yet, and don\u2019t forget to pack enough ammo to sustain those methods. Anyway, report and wait for me first and foremost. It\u2019s better for you, and no matter who kills him, you will receive a billion dollars in the end.\u201dJohn Clarke did not look happy yet, as the astronomical amount was only a mirage for now. He needed to finish making his new organization ASAP.\u201cReport regularly. I will prepare a hundred million for you for payroll and expenses, and the same amount for the trust fund. You have free rein over it, and that\u2019s it.\u201dI went out of the restaurant to the warehouse and saw that the First Evil had not owned much. He had been writing an anonymous letter to the ADA (Assistant District Attorney) who had prosecuted his case. The letter obviously threatened the life of the ADA, but was cleverly worded in such a way it couldn\u2019t be used to investigate and prosecute the sender. I did not like it, as the letter showed a high degree of legal expertise and the cunning to exploit the loopholes in the Criminal Code.The prosecutor had presented evidence that the victim was a twenty-eight-year-old man who had known the First Evil through the internet and had played online games with him. The subpoena for the chat logs had shown that the First Evil threatened the victim with death unless he cooperated. The First Evil had murdered the victim and had gotten free because the prosecutor could not prove possession of the murder weapon and crack his alibi. \u00a0Was the victim another prior awakened? Maybe\u2026 (EN: Obviously the ADA couldn\u2019t know the First Evil was using a teleportation insignia to establish an alibi. @\u00a0\u00a0)When I put the letter down, I found a small badge the size of my fingernail. Then, I saw a message pop up.[The Badge of the Sensitive (Item)Effect: Raises Perception rank by 1Class: F]He had one of the best items one could get from a Bronze Box.[Your Perception rank has increased by 1.]There were no restrictions, and items that raised Perception were rare beyond words.

I had no reason to suspect that the victim was a prior awakened just because the First Evil murdered him. Just a hunch\u2026 As the ADA(Assistant District Attorney) had discovered, the victim quit his company around the time he added the First Evil as a friend on his internet messenger.The ISP(Internet Service Provider) had given the prosecution that much information, and as most Americans had done so, he had used Gold Online(GOL) to access the internet and an online messenger program. (EN: Yep, AOL.)After walking into Jonathan\u2019s office, I could see the GOL logo on Jonathan\u2019s ADSL(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) modem in his office. He walked in with a harried expression on his face. (EN: ADSL was the fastest way to access the internet at this point in time.)\u201cI haven\u2019t even been able to go to the bathroom. What have you been doing? Your face is a mess.\u201d\u201cI need to know how many GOL shares you bought, the total shares that Jonathan Group holds. You started buying, right?\u201d\u201cThose are the first words out of your mouth?\u201dJonathan was thinking about GOL\u2019s announcement that it would buy a web browser firm, as the most likely reason for my visit. Web browsers had been considered the basis of the internet revolution. Before the biggest Operating System manufacturer started placing their own, proprietary web browser in its OS, the firm GOL was buying had ranked first. GOL was planning to buy that firm using up to ten billion dollars.\u201cIt\u2019s important, Jonathan.\u201dMy answer was short, and the papers Jonathan had asked for came. The Jonathan Group had bought a total of 9% in Gold Online shares in a week. It was quite a high number, and there would be articles while GOL\u2019s stock prices fluctuated.\u201cBrian Kim is buying them aggressively. I\u2019m thinking of making him our CIO. What do you think?\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201d\u201cRight. The board members think they have authority but will know now. Those\u00a0@rds.\u201d\u201cStop right there. How much more until we become the majority?\u201d\u201c14%. Are you thinking of intervening in their management? You can act with what we have.\u201d\u201cUntil then, give me a business card with an appropriate title.\u201d\u201cDo you want me to stop Brian? If you think this might be the wrong thing to do\u2026\u201d\u201cNo. Buy every share on the market.\u201dGOL was on the special list I had given Jonathan.\u201cDo you have the time to focus on just one thing? What\u2019s making you do this?\u201d\\n\u201cGOL will lead the dotcom boom. \u00a0Aside from that, I just want to check on a small murder.\u201d**The man was GOL\u2019s joint CEO and CFO, and while there had been other board members present, I requested a meeting alone with him. We smiled and shook hands, and now there were only the two of us.\u201cDo you want to read it?\u201dThe Executive Boardroom was set up for a visit from a major shareholder, and the report they had given me was about the web browser buy-out. He would think I had come for that, as there was no other conceivable reason for my sudden visit. I scanned the documents, then put the report down.\u201cI think this will be fruitful.\u201d\u201cThen, what\u2019s the problem? We have 40 million users on our content channel and we own 60% of the North American internet dialup ISPs. There\u2019s no other reason\u2026\u201d\u201cI learned of a murder case in the New York suburbs, and you probably know about it.\u201d\u201cIt would be poisonous if it\u2019s connected to us. \u00a0Especially if the media gets a hold of it\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cIt was unlucky, but not all things were negative after that case. Because we were able to publicly limit the scope of their subpoena, the public perception is that it takes extraordinary effort by the office of the District Attorney for us to release confidential account information. \u00a0We have increased the number of subscribers, and GOL messenger is even more popular than ever.\u201dI let the man make his pre-prepared excuses.\u201cThe case was too small to give activists a chance to push for legislation to restrict our services, and anyway the man was found innocent.\u201dNow it was my turn to speak.\u201cIt was a first-degree murder case, and the crime was particularly brutal despite the suspect being only thirteen. The victim died in a particularly gruesome and horrific way.\u201dI took out the case file, and the man received the confidential documents like it was an office memo. Only his brow furrowed a little at the harsh pictures.\u201cIf the user \u2018Adversity_Man\u2019 commits another crime, the repercussions will be massive if he uses the same ID and the same brutal methods for his next victim.\u201d\u201cHmm\u2026\u201d\\n\u201cThen, Congress will pass restrictive legislations, and we do not need those kinds of losses.\u201dThe man looked uncomfortable, and I had been waiting for that expression. The man spoke.\u201cThe case is finished in court. The boy was found innocent, and restricting him could cause massive problems if he goes public to protest. It won\u2019t end just by erasing the account and cutting him off, as you well know.\u201dI nodded.\u201cI want two things.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\u201cI want the complete chat log if he accesses GOL messenger with the same ID in the future.\u201d\u201c\u2026And?\u201d\u201cI want to see his complete relevant account information.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean by relevant?\u201d\u201cDetails of his account, chat records, list of his friend accounts, and the chat records on each account he friended.\u201d\u201cHow will you use the information?\u201d\u201cI will hand them over to our private investigators who will focus only on preventing another case in secret.\u201dThe man was silent for a while, but the game was decided when he realized he was in no position to refuse from the beginning.\u201cI agree, even though this was unexpected. I\u2019m grateful for the Jonathan group\u2019s foresight in taking care of even potential future problems.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s to protect my group\u2019s assets and nothing else.\u201d\u201cJonathan ordered this?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cI am optimistic about the \u00a0Jonathan Group\u2019s future.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d\\n-black eye has entered the room.-adversity_man: Hi.-black eye: Hi.

I did not know when he started targeting the prior Awakened but considering his age and computer proficiencies, he found them via the internet.**The confidential information from GOL for \u201c-m.cop\u201d pointed to a man named Waden Ruch. I knew the major players who founded the companies that would create the powerful IT Service industries, and Waden was considered to have pioneered the online music industry by founding Musicteca.com. He had been the first to sell music content via download. He created digital music distribution by collecting an online library of over a million music tracks and videos.However, his business suffered after the dotcom bubble broke. His disappearance was said to have been due to an incident on a trip he took after his business took a downturn. However, I now suspected he died accidentally in a dungeon or had been hunted down by the First Evil.\u201cMusicteca? There\u2019s a group like that?\u201dJonathan asked me that question.\u201cIt\u2019s an online music distribution company.\u201d\u201cThe world is changing.\u201d\u201cPut it in the list.\u201dJonathan took the memo I had given him before and added Musicteca\u2019s name. He then brought me its purchase status without my asking.\u201cWe own only 2.5%, the funds for the purchase coming from the pension funds we manage. I will start buying them using our own private funds. Also, there\u2019s an aggressive buying hand in the New York stock market.\u201d\\nI nodded, and Jonathan had guessed that it was Jillian.\u201cHe would have pension funds and millionaires backing him now.\u201dI spoke like it was nothing, but Jonathan seemed deeply interested.\u201cHow much do they have?\u201d\u201c200 billion dollars, 60% of it in pension funds.\u201d\u201cThat much?\u201dIt meant New York and the Isle of Man controlled over 500 billion dollars in pension funds.\u201cThe New York market is not the only one heating up\u2026\u201dJonathan was correct, as countries worldwide were changing their ways of investing their funds. They were customers of other elite Investment Firms, not just us, but they were investing more in us than ever before. For example, the California public employee retiree pension fund had invested 23% of their funds in us. Considering that the pension fund typically spread out their investments in multiple companies, the norm less than 1%, that number was insane.\u201cThe Russian financial war had been shocking, but this is crazy. If we grab this chance, other pension funds will start coming in.\u201d\u201cThere aren\u2019t more yet?\u201d\u201cThe scale is too large. I don\u2019t know whether you know this yet.\u201d\\nJonathan handed me a California newspaper with a deep smile, and the main article was about the California public employee retiree strike. The strike had been to protest against the decision to have their funds managed by an investment group that had started as a hedge fund. It had been quite a large protest, and the California governor was seen trying to calm them down. I asked Jonathan,\u201cDid you have them lobby for us?\u201d\u201cNo, they just did this on their own.\u201d\u201cThen, we will gobble them up.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dThe important thing was that we retain the common and especially the preferred stockholder voting rights with the shares we bought with the pension fund during the contract period. Jonathan seemed to want to talk more about Jillian and pension funds, but I had more important things to do. I stood up with the GOL documents in my hand. (EN: A preferred stock is a class of stock that is granted certain rights that differ from common stock. Namely, preferred stock often possess higher dividend payments, and a higher claim to assets in the event of liquidation.)**I needed to give osome orders and called John Clarke as I headed to where \u201c-black eye\u201d worked.<Please observe Waden Ruch, the Musicteca founder.><Do we treat him as a cat?><No, just tell me any significant events during surveillance.><Is he one of them?><I believe so.><I understand.><Also\u2026>\\n\u201cThe price\u2026\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry, I will have it prepared with the trust company.\u201dJohn\u2019s face was rigid as we were served steak.\u201cNo worries, we\u2019re the Good Guys.

The chatty truck driver that drove me here recognized me as the money, and he began to speak of the high-ranking officials that had sat in my seat. This private security company had earned money ostensibly through training law enforcement and military officers.\u201cWe Turn Men into Winners!!!\u201d\u201cRegardless of ethnicity, age, gender and sexual orientation.\u201dAs the second line seemed to have been hastily painted on the company motto, it seems that to change with the times, Whitewater was becoming more politically correct.He stopped the car, and a few men wearing military clothes with side arms came out.\u201cAsk us to do anything.\u201dThe man spoke with confidence. They were veterans, and they looked more capable than men from the national armies. This place was like the military, and I could see instructors wearing the patches from various Special Force units on their uniform, running operatives through shoot-houses, and on a gun range with motorized moving targets. \u00a0They were being trained for anti-terrorist operations\u2026\u201cThey will be going to Saudi Arabia next month.\u201d\\nHe spoke of a prince there and the steps they were taking to train his new bodyguards to ensure his safety. He was building up to ask for money, as the private security sector was like Wall Street regarding money. Violence was money for them. If they wore the full uniform of a client, they did legitimate work, however if needed, they could take over a country wearing anonymous, unmarked fatigues. Their mission will only be killing the First Evil from now on. I stopped him because he was talking too long.\u201cJust quote me a number.\u201d**I set up a trust fund just for my new private army, and set up funding for a new private investigative firm, and I had nothing left to do in New York after that. The last thing I did was to hand over the information I got from GOL to my new investigators, and I was now on the plane to Seoul.I had been about to sleep but saw the financial magazines and newspapers prepared for first-class passengers. I could not help but read them.<I will be going back today, so prepare some things for me.>I took a magazine out as I spoke on my cell phone.<What time do you arrive?><Seven.>Jonathan was on the cover of \u00a0Forbes magazine again, as he was now the financial world\u2019s superstar after the Russian financial war.\\n**I now could read about what I was doing in any financial magazine, and I saw Jonathan and Jillian\u2019s names in Forbes magazine. Jonathan Investment Group ranked first in the property management division, and while the megabanks had much more property than us, it was a notable record.Now, millionaires and billionaires would think about the New York firm when making investments, and ranking first even before adding up future private accounts meant we were now one of the \u2018shadow banks\u2019 that controlled global finance in secret.I now only had to wait for the dotcom boom and the dotcom bubble to make the real killing. I was about to sleep when someone started yelling.\u201cWhy are you talking back to me?! Just bring me more!\u201dA loud, obnoxiously self-entitled voice woke the first-class international passengers, and he seemed well-known to the stewardesses. He had been ordering drinks as I read the magazines, and I thought something like this could happen. He was a Korean man who seemed to be in his late twenties, and the peace of the first-class cabin was ruined because of him. While a few foreigners made complaints, the stewardesses could not control him.Some passengers knew who he was, and they advised others not to mess with him.I knew who he was now, and he was from Hansil, a group that ranked first in aeronautics, heavy machinery, food services, and retail distribution.Anyway, I did not want to get into a p!ssing match with such an immature kid, as he looked ready for a fight. Docile stewardesses would not be enough for him, and his eyes glistened with drink. He looked around and then started to pick a fight with me.\u201cDon\u2019t be so insolent when looking at me!\u201dI couldn\u2019t even care enough to be angry with him and just blocked his gaze by opening a magazine. I then found a familiar name, as Korea would notice Brian Kim\u2019s work in New York. The magazine announced that Brian Kim had been made CIO(Chief Information Officer) of Jonathan Investments and mentioned that Jonathan had called him a genius.**Yeonhee Woo did not recognize me at first because I had been wearing a suit, and when she did, she frantically waved her arm at me.\\n\u201cI smelled liquor on him.\u201dYeonhee Woo spoke like she was not surprised, and I looked at her while wondering what the man saw in her. She was small and cute and would not have sex appeal to a guy like him.

Making myself stronger was necessary to put down the First Evil.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to worry since only I will go into the dungeon this time.\u201dI spoke to Yeonhee, who had become silent, unlike at the airport. She looked at me with round eyes, and there was defiance in them. We were still too weak to go into higher ranked dungeons, so I chose the one in Gimje as it was an F class. However, I had not gone there before, and so my goal was exploration.\u201cI can do better this time.\u201dYeonhee spoke as she turned the car radio volume down. Six months had passed after Hwasung, and she had not been solely focused on the hospital. Her time had been devoted to training, and now she probably could use a knife better than most. If she did not have regenerative powers, her hands would have been full of scars. Also, she had gone through intensive physical training to use her agility in battle well. Her agility stat was higher than mine, even though she was a healer. She did need to protect herself.\u201cYou want to help?\u201d\u201cWhy not? You brought two backpacks.\u201dI wanted a healer, but only I had the Escape Insignia, and I explained the situation to her.\u201cYou really want to go to the dungeon?\u201d\\n\u201cI need more money.\u201dShe immediately replied.

I had not booked separate rooms as that would be more inconvenient, and Yeonhee curiously looked around the room. There were mirrors on the ceiling that looked down on us as I changed the light to normal.I sat on the waterbed, and Yeonhee sat on the floor and began examining the survival items in the backpack.While most of them had been the same as before, her eyes stopped for a moment at the fishing line and tiny hooks. However, she seemed to think I needed them for making traps as she examined the next item.The only thing I knew about this dungeon was that it was a cave with pools one could fish in if I could stomach it, should it become necessary for survival.\u201cLet\u2019s open your boxes.\u201d\\nYeonhee\u2019s face brightened at that.**Yeonhee had many points remaining, and we had waited until she got used to her agility stats, as there had been hunters who could not adjust to gaining too many stat points at once.She had received two gold boxes and a platinum box and got agility and physical healing stats out of the gold and a skill called Delight from the platinum.I gave her paper and pen to write her stats down, and things were as I remembered. She had the Mentality stat, which came from her empathic abilities. It measured how much emotion she could endure, both her own and imposed from outside, and not about the power level of her empathic skills.Yeonhee looked down at the paper after she finished writing.\u201cIf I get an Escape insignia?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll head back to Seoul.\u201dA week, the time remaining in my vacation, was not enough to conquer the dungeon.\u201cHowever, an Escape insignia does not come easily.\u201d\u201cI know it mostly comes out of dungeon boxes, but it\u2019s better that I have one so I don\u2019t slow things down, right?\u201d\u201cYeah. Open the 11 bronze boxes.\u201d\u201cCan I do it after I wash?\u201dI nodded, as if this was her ritual, I would respect it. However, she seemed to have not noticed the decor, as the motel room\u2019s bathroom had a frosted glass wall for the shower. She and I both knew I would see her silhouette, but Yeonhee seemed determined to wash up. I lay down as she washed, as long flights were tiring. I had come here to rest before going into the \u00a0dungeon. \u00a0I drowsed, waiting for her to come out.She wore more comfortable clothes, and I could see her neck. Before I went to New York, a deep wound had been there. I thought of that day until she told me she was ready.\\nShe had been happy but spoke in a desolate voice when opening the next.\u201cI got 1 Marie\u2019s Hand point.\u201d\u201cEven a single point on a high ranked skill is lucky with bronze boxes.\u201dYeonhee composed herself at my comment, and her face brightened as she stared at her chest. She had gotten an insignia and now gave it to me.[Yeonhee Woo has given you a \u2018Release\u2019 Insignia.]It was an insignia that protected me against restraint magic skills. While it was not that useful, I complimented her. She looked happier when opening the next one.\u201cI got 6 agility points! I need 25 more to increase my class, as I have 75 points now.\u201dShe opened another and got a dagger this time. Yeonhee looked at me and the dagger in surprise as this was the first time she had seen a weapon come out of a box, but I also stared at it. The weapon looked similar to the Third Virtue\u2019s main weapon. It had come from a bronze box in the previous timeline, but\u2026Yeonhee Woo gave the dagger to me.[The Fool\u2019s Knife (Item)Effect: The one wounded by this knife receives a random negative effect with a very low probability.Class: F]It really looked like the Third Virtue\u2019s infamous and blood stained weapon.

He had been that sort of an obsessed guy, and whoever he targeted had not died easily.\u201cIt\u2019s a good one, right?\u201dI nodded at her question as I knew its power, and history. The Third Virtue\u2019s weapon had been one of the strongest used by the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues, and I now understood why the Fool\u2019s Knife\u2019s was impossible to defend against. This weapon had not been registered in any databases, in my searches in the previous timeline. I could not discount the possibility of the Third Virtue having removed the database entries, as he had been secretive about its terrifying random debuff. In the previous timeline, I could only guess what the Fool\u2019s Knife actually did, based on eyewitness reports. I do know it seems to be an extremely rare weapon since I had never seen anything like it before, in my searches into the databases documenting reported drops from system boxes, and dungeon boxes.Yeonhee Woo looked satisfied as she opened the next box.\u201cI got 2 Strength points.\u201dHer voice was mixed, and she stopped opening boxes for a minute. Four boxes were remaining, and Yeonhee went to the mini fridge in the room to find a bottle of water. She was murmuring to herself about an Escape insignia.The next box gave her 9 attribute points, and she chanted \u201cI am lucky, I am lucky.\u201d. She was right, as the next box gave her a Reinforcement insignia.[Yeonhee Woo gave you a Reinforcement insignia.]It seemed like the system was telling me to reinforce the Fool\u2019s Knife, and I explained to Yeonhee what the insignia did.\u201cThis insignia is used to raise item classes, but using it does not determine success.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s luck again?\u201dI added that the possibility of succeeding went down as the class went up, and the weapon was destroyed if a reinforcement failed. I was beginning to influence Yeonhee, and she sounded as pessimistic about the system as I was.\\n\u201cRelying on luck to determine rewards is not right. We don\u2019t rely on luck inside the dungeon, and you risked your life\u2026Anyway, the Reinforcement insignia is a good one, right?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s as rare as Escape.\u201dYeonhee breathed deep at that and sounded both happy and disappointed. She looked tired as she locked her fingers together to stretch herself. She seemed to think she did not need to wash again.\u201cI\u2019m starting again.\u201dRight after those words, she hugged me, and her eyes were bright with excited tears as her voice shook.\u201cI got one!\u201d**When a man and woman sleep together on the same bed, there\u2019s a certain thought that always occurs to either person. What\u2019s more, Yeonhee was still excited about the box, and it showed in her breathing as she could not sleep yet.She closed her eyes tightly when I called her name, and the silence was tense.\u201cI\u2019ll sleep on the floor.\u201d\u201cI will.\u201dYeonhee opened her eyes then.\\n\u201cStay.\u201dI took only a pillow, as the floor was heated. I needed time to control my thoughts and cool my blood. Her soft breathing tempted me, but I could not sleep with her. Dungeons would not let us be. Such a relationship would not let us fight when needed and abandon each other when the situation was dire.I knew many people who had died like that. It had not been love, but people had still died. One did not have relationships with your party members as a rule, even though Yeonhee would not understand it.**Even after Perception rises a class, an Awakened wouldn\u2019t have heightened awareness until they learn to control their senses. Despite my regression, \u00a0I saw that I still had a ways to go, because I had not woken up when Yeonhee placed a blanket over me during the night.\u201cWhat time is it?\u201d\u201cOne.\u201dI opened the curtains to see the sunlight.\u201cI did not wake you up since you seemed tired.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go.\u201dHowever, the highway had heavy traffic due to a sudden snowfall, and two hours had passed after we had a light meal in a resting area. We were still on the highway, and I changed the radio to a finance channel that was looking back at the IMF era. I turned on the volume. Yeonhee did not seem to mind.-There are two likely reasons for Korea requiring IMF loans, and ending up receiving IMF management, right?-Yes. One theory is that large domestic firms caused confusion due to mismanagement. The other is that we were too obsessed with foreign funds and firms, leading to unsustainable loans.-It was about a year ago when Jonathan came to Korea. We can\u2019t omit that.-Korea\u2019s problems, post IMF, haven\u2019t really gone away, as foreign firms and companies based on foreign funds like Jeonil are still the major players in Korea.\\nHowever, I already had the Fool\u2019s Knife out, and out of all the items, my best option was to do the same thing the Third Virtue had done. I had my own ritual, and that was to reinforce items at night. I had made an A class weapon to an S on a night like this.\u201cI\u2019ll give you a bonus if this turns to E. So, wish me luck.\u201d\u201cIt will. We\u2019re lucky.\u201dShe seemed to be thinking of her luck with the Escape insignia, which meant we could have a real shot at this. The system activated itself. (EN: Yep, Sun is superstitious too. He just refuses to admit it. ^_^ )[You have used the insignia \u2018Reinforcement.\u2019][Will you use it on the Fool\u2019s Knife?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d[The insignia \u2018Reinforcement\u2019 has now been removed.]A copper light wrapped itself around the dagger, and if this failed, I would be holding nothing.[Congratulations, you have succeeded.][The item class has risen from F to E.][Congratulations! You have gained a Gold Box for being the second Awakened to succeed in reinforcing an item.][You have gained 57 agility points.][Congratulations! Your agility class has risen.

He did have a \u201csilent confrontation\u201d (p!ssing match) regarding the final authority over fiscal policy with Daehwan Cho, the Director of Accounting. However, the recent personnel changes cemented Chungsik\u2019s position as Jeonil\u2019s second-in-command. He was the major stockholder for over thirty firms, had given birth to the Jeonil Bank, and Jeonil owned enough land to stretch from Seoul to Busan. He was nicknamed the Financial President of Korea now.\u201cPlease don\u2019t say such things.\u201dChungsik Park shook his head.\u201cHow could a foreign girl do so much? You were the one who did everything.\u201dHwan Cho realized his mistake right after saying so, as Chungsik Park\u2019s smile disappeared in an instant.\u201cI\u2019m sorry. Will drinking this as punishment be OK?\u201dHwan Cho poured soju into a water glass, filling it half way, and slammed it down before Chungsik Park could stop him. (EN: Soju is a clear, colorless distilled alcoholic beverage of Korean origin. It is usually consumed neat, and its alcohol content varies from about 16.8% to 53% alcohol by volume (ABV). Most brands of soju are made in South Korea. While soju is traditionally made from the grains of rice, wheat, or barley, modern producers often replace rice with other starches, such as potato and sweet potato. This liquor features in the drinking culture of Korea.) (EN: And it\u2019s harsh. And the hangovers are deadly. ^_^)\u201cI will have a large drink, too.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that.

Ilsung\u2019s CEO is also a woman.\u201d\u201cYes, do I need to drink another shot for punishment?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\\n\u201cThen, don\u2019t be so angry. How can I live when the \u201cUnofficial\u201d Financial President\u2019s face is like that?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s an exaggeration. You know that I\u2019m not rich, my personal worth is less than your fingernail.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t fool me. If you wanted money, you would have remained in Kim and Park. I saw what happened today. That old man from Daehyeon, and Ilsung\u2019s young girl could not say anything in front of you. That was a treat.\u201dChungsik Park smiled and checked his wristwatch. Hwan Cho began to speak faster.\u201cI\u2019m holding you back. I\u2019ll get to the point.\u201d\u201cPlease.\u201d\u201cHansil Confectionary. That\u2019s yours, right?\u201dWhile Hwan Cho sounded indifferent, Chungsik Park knew what he was thinking. He remained silent, as he was at an advantage and he needed only to wait for the opponent to speak, to crush him.\u201cAren\u2019t you going to talk?\u201d\u201cWhat more can I say?\u201d\u201cPut Jeonil\u2019s shares in Hansil on the market, and I will take care of the rest. I will give you 100 billion won.\u201d (EN: Approximately $150,000,000 in 2021 dollars.)Chungsik Park did not flinch at the astronomical amount.\u201cI would have done so if it was my property, and not Jeonil\u2019s, \u00a0but what more can I say? Why does Hansil matter so much to you?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve become cunning. I know that it\u2019s your work.\u201dJamie had ordered a while ago to gain certain subsidiaries no matter what, and Hansil had been one of the smallest subsidiaries in the Hansil Group. Hansil Foods was the bigger company, but\u2026Hansil Confectionary manages Hansil Group\u2019s owner shares. Things will get intense. Chungsik Park took a drink. (EN: Yep, Sun sneaked in to buy up the Hansil Chaebol without anyone noticing until it was too late. ^_^)\\n\u201cI need to go back to the firm since it\u2019s late.\u201d\u201cI can give you ten times more.\u201d\u201cAs you said, I don\u2019t want money.\u201d\u201cEveryone likes money, and how can you be sure that you will remain in Jeonil next year? Prepare a retirement fund.\u201d\u201cThank you for your advice. I will take your leave.\u201d\u201cHey, hey!\u201dChungsik Park smiled as Hansil\u2019s president had been too late. Daehyun had offered 200 billion won. He did not envy anyone of any Chaebol, as everyone with money had to bow to him. Chungsik Park went back to his car.\u201cHansil\u2019s secretaries placed something in your trunk.\u201dThe driver spoke, and Chungsik Park\u2019s tone was mild.\u201cI heard that you\u2019re a smart one\u2026\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cYou should know better.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201d\u201cSince this is your first day, I\u2019ll forget this.

Will you go home?>\\n\u201cKorean reporters don\u2019t know anything yet.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why I called you here. To hear directly from you.\u201dAs the country suffered during the Asian Financial Crisis, the large conglomerates and Chaebols created slush funds and reorganized their management system, so certain firms acted as holding firms. For instance, the Ilsung Group circulated their working capital out of their holding companies, so Ilsung Dreamland owned the entire group, and Daehyun Elevator with Hansil Confectionary acted like that. The holding company\u2019s \u00a0shares were owned by the top of each group and would be at the center of management right successions. That was how groups could be ruled with so few shares.\u201cI\u2019ve been waiting.\u201dJamie looked confident now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, when Typhoon Olga hit Korea, the torrential rains failed to cool down the stock market. In my previous life, the Korean stock market went just as crazy as the New York stock market during the dotcom boom. After the Russian financial war ended last year, the 10 billion dollars I had placed in Jeonil Group used to buy Korean property, indirectly bolstered the Korean stock market by increasing the amount of capital held in Korean hands, and things changed for the better there.There were major fluctuations in the market, and at the peak, the KOSPI rose 1000 points in a single day, so the changes were significant in this era. (EN: The Korea Composite Stock Price Index or KOSPI is the index of all common stocks traded on the Stock Market Division\u2014previously, Korea Stock Exchange\u2014of the Korea Exchange. It is the representative stock market index of South Korea, like the S&amp;P 500 in the United States. )Daehyun Securities rushed to create a \u2018Buy Korean Stocks,\u2019 which exploited the Korean people\u2019s patriotism. That fund asked Koreans to buy domestic stocks at a reduced price before foreigners \u201cbought up Korea\u201d. That was the first time the Korean public became interested in stocks. Another factor was the \u2018Cyber Korea 21\u2019 initiative by the government. That was the plan that made Korean IT what it was in the future and also caused massive activity in the KOSDAQ. With the KOSPI increase, the KOSDAQ market was spinning out of control. Now, it was no longer just the New York dotcom boom starting the speculative gambling on dotcom startups. In this country\u2019s case, Koreans did it all on their own. (EN: KOSDAQ (acronym of Korean Securities Dealers Automated Quotations) is a trading board of Korea Exchange (KRX) in South Korea established in 1996. Initially set up by Korea Financial Investment Association as an independent stock market from the Korean Stock Exchange, it was benchmarked from the American counterpart, NASDAQ. KOSDAQ is an electronic stock market, just like NASDAQ. ) (EN: Cyber Korea 21 is the Korean Government\u2019s blueprint for building an Information Society by 2002.)**I wanted to finish high school, as I wanted my parents \u00a0to at least see me graduate like others since I was not growing up normally. However, I realized that middle school was my limit. I managed to increase my Agility to the next rank the day I reinforced the Fool\u2019s Dagger. However, someone had reinforced a weapon and raised their Agility rank before I had. That meant that my lead ahead of all the other pre-Awakened was smaller than I had expected. I couldn\u2019t afford to waste time by going to high school, but I wanted them to be able to trust I had done something for my future rather than display my \u201cimmaturity\u201d.\u201cFather, I need to talk to you about something.\u201dMy skin felt clammy late at night as I waited for my father to change into pajamas first. He had not asked about the million won he had given me but seemed to realize that I was going to talk to him about that. He sat on my bed and looked at the HTS site on my monitor. However, he was not near enough to see the numbers yet, so he pretended he was indifferent. (EN: HTS is the Home Trading System)\u201cYou started stocks? I hope you didn\u2019t go into KOSDAQ\u2026let\u2019s see.\u201dFather came to sit in front of the computer, and I looked in with him.[Account Name: Sunhoo Na]\\n[Account Value: 143,500,000 won][Evaluated Profit: 142,500,000 won][Profit Rate: +14250%]My million won had grown to that amount, and Father quickly moved the mouse after that. I only heard the clicks as he checked my transaction details over the six months. (EN: $210,000.00 approximately, in today\u2019s dollars)\u201cHow did you manage school?\u201d\u201cI reserved the transactions.\u201dFather would know about Silver Bank, as the firm was well known for stock manipulation and started the KOSDAQ boom. The transactions spread over tens of pages, and Father looked at those in April. Silver Bank\u2019s stock prices had fluctuated then, which made it possible to make a profit. The mouse clicked over to May, and I had only made one transaction in May compared to hundreds in April. I had sold everything when Silver Bank hit the highest price.Silver Bank would have given me a 5500% profit if I simply stood by and did nothing, but I traded with intermediaries to increase the profit nearly three times.Today, Silver Bank\u2019s stock price had gone down by nearly half.\u201c\u2026Why did you stop dealing?\u201dFather\u2019s voice was confused.\u201cI am waiting to invest into other firms and I am observing.\u201d\u201cTell me.\u201d\\nA computer firm whose stocks would increase by 14700% in a year, a tech firm that would increase by 15000% in six months, and a communication firm that would increase by 1700% in twenty-five days\u2026I recited those names, as companies I had my eye on, but my real focus was on a different target. Balgeum Tech had been the biggest documented increase during the dotcom bubble, and it actually happened in Korea. While cryptocurrency would show a record increase in the long term in the future, the KOSDAQ boom beat bit-coins in short-term increase in value.Everyone was crazy about stocks now. Housewives sat all day in front of the computer, taxi drivers talked about stocks amongst themselves, rather than about their customers, and university students looked at the stock prices rather than studying. However, when the bubble burst, the public would have to face the consequences. Look at Silver Bank after the boom ended.\u201cI have to show you something.\u201dI managed to get the words out and changed places with Father to open an email from Jonathan Investments.[Subject: Welcome, Mr. Na][We are deeply intrigued in your research, especially your estimates regarding the NASDAQ market and details about Googol and APE. Do you know that Will Conseb, the famous hedge fund manager, worked as an analyst starting from his teens?

I showed him the research the mail had mentioned, and I was tenser than when I had first entered the dungeon.I have not even graduated middle school yet.\u201cYou gave me that stock account a year ago.\u201d\u201c\u2026I did. You wrote this?\u201d\\n\u201cGo traveling, go to America. Do what you want now.\u201dI fell silent as the situation was completely different from what I had thought.

I also had cried that night, as I had underestimated how my parents loved me. I was their only son who had lived under the same roof. My parents must have thought hard about how to raise a child who was superior to other children in physical and intellectual ability, and when to let me go so I can spread my wings.While I had skipped the period the system had named Tutorial, I could see from the pictures that my parents had completely doted on me.The next day, Mother brought me an album after Father went to work. She talked about old times as she turned pages, and I saw that I grew up fast. In elementary school, I had obviously been the tallest, standing at the back for the class photo. There was a picture of me in a taekwondo uniform. Seeing how often my parents had taken pictures without me noticing, I had an awkward smile on my face.\u201cWe took you to art classes, piano, sports\u2026but the only thing you wanted to keep doing was tennis. Do you remember this?\u201dMother spoke with a smile. I had been able to pass as a very tall child until elementary first grade.\u201cDid I?\u201dAs I grew older, the pictures were taken more and more outside. I was doing chin-ups, soccer, and other sports.\u201cThe sports coaches all told me you could make the Olympic team. They even came to our house, you know.\u201d\\nShe spoke warmly about the past.\u201cWe thought you were talented in sports, but they never lasted longer than three months.\u201d\u201cDid I say I wouldn\u2019t go? I don\u2019t remember much.\u201d\u201cYou never said such things.\u201d\u201cThen?\u201d\u201cWe could clearly see that you did not want to go. We were grateful that you willingly tried so many things.\u201dMother flipped over the last page, and school certificates poured out. I had done well in my studies, but my elementary school teachers consistently worried about my inability to make friends due to physical and mental differences. They had written negative things about my lack of social interaction, which meant my parents would have received their calls. My mother bent closer with a smile.\u201cYou were an excellent student like your father.\u201dI had been first in school, and I probably acted aloof and prideful because I thought that would make my parents happy. She stared at me, and I worried she may cry. However, her smile did not fade.\u201cI\u2019m just happy you found something you like to do. Really.\u201d\\n**My walk to the office was light despite the heavy rains. Yeonhee opened her eyes wide, and she also smiled when she noticed my emotions. She became quiet and seemed to focus on feeling my emotions as she sat on the sofa. She looked almost like she was happy-drunk.I also did not want to turn on the computer now, as I had seen too many reports saying that they had not caught the First Evil. Also, the other two awakened in New York were quiet.The rain was falling hard, and I watched the drops for a while. I met Yeonhee\u2019s eyes, which were too smug for my tastes.\u201cAre you coming from home?\u201d\u201cYes. Did you find what I asked?\u201d\u201cI managed to do so.\u201d**Dungeons were normally buried in mountains and large plains. The dungeon in Suwon was the same, and the construction was already underway. We were the only ones on the road due to the weather, and Yeonhee\u2019s car shook whenever the wind blew harshly. The puddles made for slow driving, and I thought about changing to a car that could be driven smoothly in this terrain, in this weather. Yeonhee was completely focused on driving and did not even answer her cell phone.I could not even hear the cell phone ring due to the rain despite sitting in the front with her, and the wipers lost the battle against the rain. The weather was terrible, and Yeonhee leaned back against the driver\u2019s seat when we barely managed to arrive near the hill in Suwon. We had parked near an apartment complex, and it seemed that nearby residents used this hill to do their exercises.I realized that there would be countless complaints if I raised walls here, and I had been wondering whether to choose a dungeon in a more secluded area instead when Yeonhee straightened her back.\\n\u201cIt was not open yesterday.\u201dYeonhee looked around with wary eyes and pulled out a hidden dagger from her waist. I now knew that she walked around armed. That was why she preferred wide pants. I thought she was just following fashion trends.I also took out a dagger and threw away the sheath. I did not need to tell her to be cautious of the other Awakened and she had been even quicker to arm herself than I was. She spoke.\u201cHow many? It may not be only one, right?\u201dAll traces were erased by the rain, and I looked around for places where a person might be hiding near enough to overhear me. There was such a place, and the spot was covered with dead trees, which meant it would be sheltered a bit from the rain. So I spoke in a low voice. (EN: He\u2019s a bit paranoid, but given that someone opened and entered a dungeon just before they got there\u2026)\u201cYou seem to know what to do.\u201d\u201cA bit.\u201d\u201cIf you had met another Awakened\u2026\u201d\u201cI, I would have told you first.\u201d\u201cWe will talk about this later.\u201dYeonhee bit her lips, and she looked worried and scared.

Even though it was summer, we had been standing in a rainstorm. Yeonhee pointed with her chin at the front as her lips turned blue. The blue light had gone out. I signaled to her that she should wait. We did not see anyone for a while, and I walked up to the dungeon entrance.[You have discovered a dungeon.][Will you open it?]The dungeon was now sealed again, and the mud covered where the blue barrier and the stairs had been. The dungeon reseals itself when the Awakened who had gone in has died inside. If another Awakened did not open the dungeon again, this place would just be another spot on this hill.\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dI did not know how that individual had discovered this dungeon in this weather, but he or she had died in the dungeon, just like that.\u201cDead, right?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s sad.\u201dYeonhee\u2019s words were short, but her face was filled with complicated emotions. We came back to the car to change our clothes. It was still raining, and I saw Yeonhee\u2019s rigid face as the downpour increased in intensity. She was deep in thought, and from her face, I knew that she would not be thinking pleasant thoughts.\u201cYou seem to be thinking that it\u2019s easy to die in dungeons, right?\u201dYeonhee nodded, but she seemed to be agreeing with my words instead of really thinking about what I said. What was it then?\\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing.\u201dYeonhee\u2019s right hand shook a bit. She had already re-sheathed her dagger, but her hand was fisted like she was holding it. I then thought that I knew what she was thinking about now.\u201cYou did well.\u201d\u201cYes?\u201d\u201cYour battle instincts are good. Be wary next time, too. Don\u2019t question yourself.\u201d**I had to consider the slim possibility that someone now knew about the Suwon dungeon. Therefore, I changed the next dungeon to Gangneung and searched for the gate with Yeonhee. Two days have passed after Typhoon Olga swept through Korea, leaving fifty dead in its wake.<I am sending you the address by text. I am including the street names and the turns so you can easily find the building.> Of course the building owner couldn\u2019t know we already knew the location, as we had located the Gangneung dungeon inside his property. \u00a0To save myself some bothersome things, I simply bought the building.<Thank you again. We will start for it right away.>Gyeongpodae was full of people despite the recent floods. It was the vacation period and also a weekend, so it seemed that everyone had come here. It was now a typical Korean summer night, and young people filled the beaches as the sun set.Yeonhee ate sashimi and spoke while looking at the beach where people were drinking.\u201cIs there a chance that one of \u2018them\u2019 is out there?\u201dShe was talking about prior Awakened.\u201cIf we were common, the world would know about us by now.\u201d\\nI spoke calmly, because though pre-Awakened activities may cause one or two conspiracy theories and urban legends if witnessed, the Awakened went public only after the Day of Reckoning. Come to think of it, I had only been focused on finance until now, and only monitored the chatter on the BBS boards for the conspiracy theories that were based on actual fact, and of interest to me. Like the conspiracy theory that the global elites in finance met secretly in an anonymous hotel each year, to discuss\u2026(EN: A bulletin board system or BBS (also called Computer Bulletin Board Service, CBBS) is a computer server running software that allows users to connect to the system using a terminal program.

In the early 1980s, message networks such as FidoNet were developed to provide services such as NetMail, which is similar to internet-based email. This type of service predates chat rooms by decades.)I don\u2019t have time to indulge in fantasy, I\u2019ve confirmed that dungeons exist in this world. The race to get stronger has already begun\u2026 The internet communities I checked aren\u2019t talking about it, meaning that the information is still controlled. Otherwise, the socially inept and straight nutters who inhabit the BBS would be blaming the Awakened for everything from trying to control the global economy, to Global Warming to Nuclear Weapons Proliferation.\u201cI\u2019ll take a walk.\u201dYeonhee stood up after eating, and I also came out of the restaurant. I did not know when I would be able to walk among people again, peacefully. While we both had Escape Insignias, our goal was to conquer the dungeon. We had our backpacks ready in the new car and would enter the Gimje dungeon tomorrow.**We found a clean hotel in Gangneung downtown before heading to the dungeon. The Gangneung dungeon looked similar to the hospital I had built before. I saw CCTV cameras as I unlocked the door to enter.[Yeonhee Woo has joined your party.]We went down to the basement, where the entrance was and opened the dungeon. The room shook and the blue barrier appeared. Everything was as before, but there was a sloping ramp instead of stairs.Yeonhee looked surprised. I only knew that this dungeon was a cave and did not know anything else. However, there was a reason I chose this one out of others. I spoke while looking down.\u201cA dungeon like this is not complicated in structure. The areas are not divided by doors and corridors. There are no traps and almost no branching paths.\u201d\u201cI know that we won\u2019t need to make maps. But if the areas are not divided\u2026\u201dYeonhee seemed to realize by instinct that there would be another danger here.\\nIt was sudden. We threw ourselves forward, and dirt flew like rain over where we had been standing. Something black fell down and its body thumped on the ground. The upper body was nearly as big as mine, and two disgusting antennas twitched spastically, to smell the air, searching for yummy human flesh. Its teeth were like hooks, but there was only one of them. I grabbed the antennas and ripped them off. They still moved on the ground, and Yeonhee stepped on them as they crawled towards her. She was acting like I had told her. We had called the joint between the thorax and the head as the neck for convenience in my past life.I beheaded it and remembered their blood was red as it flowed from its body.[You have exterminated an infant Graf.][You have received two points.][ Graf Extermination 1/30]Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, it was still deemed an infant by the system. As the Graf became an adult, it became large and heavy enough that as it crawled around, the ground would tremble as if a large tracked vehicle was moving nearby. (EN: 3 meters=9.8 feet?! That\u2019s a BIG bug!)\u201cDespite how it looks, the monster can still think, as it has a brain like us.\u201dYeonhee looked disgusted by the Graf and gasped as I broke apart its head to take out the brain. It was smaller than my fist.\u201cHowever, its peripheral nervous system is located mainly in the antennas, which means that a Graf without them cannot function normally. Since you don\u2019t have enough strength to rip them apart, cut them with your dagger.\u201d (EN: The peripheral nervous system is one of two components that make up the nervous system of bilateral animals, with the other part being the central nervous system. The PNS consists of the nerves and ganglia outside the brain and spinal cord.)I then cut off a leg, and its sticky red blood oozed out from where my blade had sliced it.\u201cIt\u2019s not a giant centipede, but a different race altogether. See how the leg is long, flexible, and sharp? You see the poison gland at the end?\u201dI continued to dissect it. They did not have genitalia, as Grafs were born from Queens who walked on two feet. As big as they were, the intestines that covered their magic stones were large and odorous.\u201cDon\u2019t forget where the poison glands are. There are additional poison glands on the chin and the legs.\u201d\u201cOnly skills and insignias can act as antidotes, right?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201d\\nYeonhee\u2019s face turned dark, as she knew that we had no such methods.\u201cTheir poison is horrendous and painful as hell. However, it works out of your system after a few days, so don\u2019t worry too much.\u201dWhile a detoxification skill would be nice, the possibility of getting one was extremely low for both of us.It was then I heard a faint sound ahead of us, and Yeonhee did not seem to notice it. Something was tunneling through the bare dirt, and we hid behind the large pillar that connected the ceiling and the ground. I saw another Graf come out of the ground. It looked at the decapitated and partially dissected corpse of its fellow Graf, and its antennas twitched quickly towards us. The Graf started to slowly back away, to bolt back to where it had come from, and we only had a few seconds before it skittered away.Yeonhee was waiting for my signal, and I shook my head. Since we could only see its head and back covered with hard shells, we could not kill it instantaneously with anything in our arsenal.Attacking it only meant it would burrow back into the ground, beyond our reach. I decided that it was time to use the Ruler\u2019s Ring.[You have used the Ruler\u2019s Ring on the Infant Graf.]I felt an aura spread from the ring and covered the Graf\u2019s body.[You have succeeded in capturing the Infant Graf.]The monster was swallowed up by the ring in a matter of seconds, and I couldn\u2019t help but wonder what it would have been like to have this item before I went back in time. If I had managed to use this item in a B class dungeon, I would have been able to acquire a decently powerful monster I could get to fight for me. This ring would have quickened my pace in conquering B rank and lower class dungeons. However, that was unrealistic, and would only happen in my fantasies. (EN: I was unable to find the chapter which mentioned that Sun reached A rank before he went back in time. Sorry. ) (EN: The Ruler\u2019s Ring: The user can control a monster of a lower class to fight for you. However, monsters designated for boss quests and One-on-One combat quests are excluded. Chapter 77)\\nI could only use this ring when there was only one monster, as I would be swarmed and killed in seconds if there were others. Also, going into a B class dungeon without a B class Escape Insignia meant certain death. Besides, I simply had not acquired this ring before I returned, so therefore, here and now, this was the appropriate time and place to use the ring. (EN: Obviously, so far as the ring is concerned, Sun is E class.)\u201cIt disappeared.\u201dI explained to Yeonhee what had happened, and she looked at the ring with bright eyes.**We walked for an hour but did not cover much distance as we were walking slowly. I had focused all my senses on my hearing, and Yeonhee breathed as quietly as possible. I had acted as a scout before in my previous life since my main stat was Perception then. Yeonhee raised her dagger when I stopped, and I was impressed by her reflexes.A large Graf skittered out of the hole in the ground, which appeared right where Yeonhee would have stepped next. Yeonhee had good reflexes, as she attacked immediately. \u00a0She seemed to have been aiming for one of its antennas, but she was head-butted before she could cut it off. Yeonhee flew in the air but managed to land safely.The monster targeted me now, but that move was stupid. It should have gone for Yeonhee, as it exposed its softer underbelly before its slashing leg touched me. I beheaded it, but the longsword I had brought broke in two during that attack.\u201cIt\u2019s not over. They are coming.\u201dI heard tens of legs moving in from all directions. Monsters could appear anywhere in this dungeon.[You activated the Ruler\u2019s Ring.][Captured Object: Infant Graf][Used on Yeonhee Woo]\\n\u2026[Graf Extermination: Graf Extermination 20/30]I used the Fool\u2019s Knife on them all, and fortunately the random debuff effect occurred reliably after I had reinforced the weapon. I turned around and saw Yeonhee sitting on the ground. She was covered in blood but could not find her balance due to her backpack. I took it off her and helped her stand up.\u201cThank you, that was a terrible sound. I think my eardrums burst deep inside.\u201dShe knew this state quite well.\u201cWere you bitten or hit?\u201d\u201cThat one blocked everything.\u201dYeonhee looked at the captured monster, which lay dead with others. She had killed three, which impressed me. She seemed to be skilled at fighting, as she was uninjured after those kills.\u201cLean on me.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re not resting here?\u201d\u201cThere is water nearby.\u201dI could see her eyes widen, but I had better hearing than her. I had heard water flow somewhere faintly during the fight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Normally, \u00a0we could only wipe off the blood on our faces after exiting the dungeon. However, things were different in a dungeon with water sources, making it possible to use water freely. That alone was a privilege, and while we only saw small puddles, we may see a pond if we followed the passageway.\u201cThere really is water.\u201dYeonhee looked like someone who found an oasis in a desert, and we even found a dungeon box. She looked like she forgot her pain at seeing water and the dungeon box, and I helped her sit before approaching the puddle to secure the area. There were thankfully no Grafs nearby, and I took a drink.\u201cIt\u2019s drinkable.\u201dOf course we brought our own bottles of water, which will be rationed as much as possible, as they were known safe and portable. However, we could at least wash. \u00a0I helped Yeonhee to the puddle, and we took off our clothes after she took a drink. However, Yeonhee found it difficult to take off her shirt as it was sticky and clotted with dried Graf blood. She spoke as I helped her take off her clothes.\u201cYou\u2019re not hurt like you were in Hwasung, right?\u201d\u201cNo. Can you wash alone?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dWe were now in our underwear, and Yeonhee bent forward in the puddle to wash her face. I followed suit and thought of our battle before. Grafs were much more powerful than Canine Pawns, but we only suffered temporary hearing loss after killing tens of them. I would have been wounded more heavily if Yeonhee had not healed me, but even taking that into account, such a feat had not been possible in my previous life. I was not yet an E class hunter but had killed numerous Grafs without significant injury. It was not Devi\u2019s Knife itself that had resulted in this. I realized that I had something else outside the System categories \u2013 my memories. I had been an A class hunter in my previous life, and I retained my combat skills. I remembered tactics, weak points of enemies, how to track and respond to multiple targets, attacking groups, defending from groups, and all the hard-won lessons in survival from thousands of Life and Death struggles. \u00a0That helped me use Devi\u2019s Knife so effectively.My memories applied to other skills besides the Devi\u2019s Knife, and I became certain that my experiences would be more and more effective as my stats increased. While I was still not as strong as before, I was getting there. That encounter made me realize that the System did not, could not account for my battle experience!\u201cWe may end this earlier than my estimates.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d\u201cIt may take less than a month.\u201dThe problem was the boss monster fight.\\n**The dungeon box gave me 8 Perception points, and I had a total of 33 now. I got items or points from dungeon boxes four times out of ten, which was quite good luck. Yeonhee relaxed as she looked at me.\u201cDid you get something good?\u201dI nodded. It took a day for Yeonhee to heal, and we killed one or two Grafs that approached us now and then. Since they would be scouting for intruders, we had to kill them. I beheaded one before it could screech, and it was the last one. (EN: Remember Yeonhee can\u2019t use her healing skills on herself. )[Graf Extermination: Graf Extermination 30/30][You have completed the quest \u2018Graf Extermination.\u2019 Please decide who is in first place.]We exchanged glances before I spoke to the system.[You have completed the quest \u2018Graf Extermination.\u2019][You have gained 1500 points.][You have gained a Silver Box as your first completion reward.]Yeonhee\u2019s eyes were filled with anticipation as she looked up at me. Still, she did not know yet that moments like this would become sentimental memories after the Day of Reckoning. Deciding who was the first place had been a vicious, often murderous battle in my previous life, even under a contract. While hunters knew that killing someone would mean one less combatant or support and may endanger the entire party, it still happened.I turned from Yeonhee to wait for my reward. I wanted Sense or Stamina points to reach E class stats without items.[The Man Who Overcame Adversity increased by 11 points.][The Man Who Overcame Adversity has increased by one class.

However, it became a disgusting place not long after our arrival, as it became littered with Graf corpses. Worse, the corpses of the Grafs appeared to be staring at us. We decided it was time for us to move. We each took a backpack covered with blood. This was our second day here, and we had fought against nearly thirty Infant Grafs after they swarmed us. The result was not bad. However, the sudden sharp, stabbing pains in our head and body cut our exploration short, and prevented us from relocating further into the dungeon. I had to carry Yeonhee back to the waterhole\u2026My ring and Yeonhee\u2019s Hate skill had enabled us to control two Grafs. We managed to beat the thirty infant Grafs without using the Man Who Overcame Adversity. We thought we had not been seriously poisoned, but by the next day, we were lying on the ground, moaning in pain.It was freezing, and my body shook out of control. Yeonhee and I hugged each other, and the problem was not only the cold. I could smell a disgusting odor because I could not control my bodily functions. Fortunately, my senses were faintly alive despite being poisoned. We were surrounded by Graf corpses, and due to my pain, I was not able to keep track of the number of corpses around us, or even muster the minimal concentration needed to simply recount the bodies. Some instinct had alerted me, and I began to suspect that one of the corpses was missing, and that one had been playing dead, and disappeared back to the herd on the second day. Unfortunately, the poison left me too debilitated to take any action on my suspicions.\\nFollow new episodes on the lightnov\u200delworld.c\u200dom platform.I heard a moan from Yeonhee, and the painkillers were wearing off. She was in a worse state than I was, which meant she was barely alive. It was by sheer luck that her limbs were whole. I groped around to find the pills. Yeonhee buried her face in my chest to scream as the opiates would not nullify all the pain. She could not sleep even if she wanted to.The fourth day was sheer hell, as my head flashed between cold and heat. I felt like I was being bitten by Grafs and hoped they were hallucinations. We became better after the fifth day and were released from hell on the sixth. We were now detoxified, and my suspicion that the \u201cmissing\u201d Graf had led the rest of the swarm to attack us was confirmed. I saw with pain-free, clear eyes that corpses were everywhere, far more than the original thirty, and not one of them was whole. I must have cut off their legs and heads, which should have been an impossible feat with my current stats. It seemed like ALL the monsters nearby had swarmed us. I could not move a step without stepping on a corpse, and I could not understand how we had survived here for the past few days. Moreover, I found strange wounds that were way above the level of damage I could do. Some corpses had exploded like bombs had gone off inside of them.I tried to remember the fight. I remembered that I tried to behead one, and sparks flew out of my dagger as I stabbed it. The Fool\u2019s Dagger had activated then as I was splashed in the Graf\u2019s blood and shell pieces. I shouted to Yeonhee as the Man Who Overcame Adversity activated and saw to my despair that there were too many. She used Bravery on me, and I used Devi\u2019s Knife desperately. I then used Earthquake\u2026I remembered flashes but could not remember the events in consecutive order. My memories were shattered, as if a video tape had been thrown into a shredder and the tape spliced back together. The Devi\u2019s Knife would have increased in rank after the Man Who Overcame Adversity activated, but I did not know how it could inflict the decapitations and amputations, much less the internal explosions I saw in the Grafs. I could only assume that I went berserk, fighting on pure instinct, the adrenaline flooding my body clearing my head. Yeonhee\u2019s Bravery skill might have been what kept the poison from overwhelming me, which would have left me helpless under the maws of the Grafs. I could not think of any other explanation for our survival.We went back to a waterhole I had discovered while carrying Yeonhee when we first felt the poison hit us, and it was bigger than the one we found on the first day. We made a fire using Graf chitin as firewood. She relaxed after a while despite the smell.\u201c\u2026What happened?\u201d\u201cThere were more than a hundred of them. I\u2019m sorry. I must have missed a scout.\u201dIt seemed Yeonhee was healing, despite the severe bite wounds on her chest and legs.\u201cWait here.\u201d\u201cAre you going alone?\u201d\\n\u201cThere had been no scouts the past few days, and if one comes\u2026\u201dI placed the Ruler\u2019s Ring in Yeonhee\u2019s hand.Follow current novels on lightnov\u200celworld.c\u200dom\u201cI\u2019m not talking about that.

The cave was narrowing slowly, and I found a bottleneck. I saw that the space spread out beyond the narrowed hole, and I saw the bottom of a stone statue and two dungeon boxes. I felt that the One-on-One quest was near. I do not know what the space was used for, as it may be a shrine or a weapon warehouse. I only knew that the statue would wake up the moment I entered that area. Those statues with their concealed \u201csurprise\u201d had been common in E class Graf dungeons. I had no reason to hesitate since it was an easy quest. I went in.\\nIt was a sickening sight, and I grabbed its head and pulled it with all my strength, pulling the armor segment off that was protecting the neck.

However, that\u2019s how the author wrote it. Here\u2019s what I think is happening. During a time when Sun and Yeonhee had been poisoned during an encounter, they got ambushed by around a hundred baby Grafs. Somehow, Sun, with Yeonhee\u2019s help, fought them off.The source of this content is lightnov\u200celworld.c\u00adomAs soon as he\u2019s better, Sun does what he always does. He observes and analyzes the events. My takeaway from this part is that Sun is freaking out inside, and he\u2019s doing his routines to hold it in, so he doesn\u2019t grab Yeonhee and run back to the entrance. It\u2019s pretty obvious from s that Sun is a person obsessed with planning and control and the author was excellent at Showing that and not simply Telling the readers. So he\u2019s analyzing things to keep from having hysterics, which anyone else would do in his situation. He also doesn\u2019t like the partial memory loss, and the fact he must have gone berserk, losing his control, in order to win against impossible odds. Yep, I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only person who thinks that Sun has OCD.This finally explains his solo battle with the medium-sized Graf. He doesn\u2019t even go in with Yeonhee once he\u2019s identified the room with the One-on-One quest. Yeonhee could heal him from range, and even if it fails the quest, it would save his life in case things went wrong. However, the encounter with the medium-sized Graf WENT EXACTLY AS SUN PREDICTED. Sun is in complete control of this encounter.

She saw the weird creature a few days later. I brought a strange creature from a big pond near where I had killed the Middle Graf. It was not a dangerous monster as it did not give me points. We would have to think of this as a deep-sea creature instead of an alien if we wanted to eat it without being sickened.\\n[You have gained the \u2018Collector\u2019 Trait as the first place reward.][Collector (Trait)][Effect: Lowers the probability of an item disappearing after reinforcement failure by little.][Class: F]This was the first time I had seen a Trait like this, and while it was much better than what I would have normally gotten, I needed to think things over whether to keep it or not.I opened the second box and hoped for something GOOD\u2026[You have gained \u2018Phobia (Individual).][Phobia (Individual)][Effect: The subject becomes afraid of a person.][Class: F]The source of this content is lightnov\u200delworld.c\u200domWas this a curse? However, Yeonhee did not seem to know I had gotten one. I signaled her to heal me. It was then I saw her looking at my rings with passionate eyes. She would be stupid not to know their value and she had actually worn the Ruler\u2019s Ring. I also had seven other items, and Yeonhee had given me more than half of them. She may think she had been wronged, but she could not attack me as I was stronger than her.Yeonhee had not gone through the Trial Tests yet, but humans were evil by nature. She would also be a threat, and I would need to remove her before she could betray me.

I pushed Yeonhee sideways and grabbed the \u201cchin\u201d of a head that had popped up out of the ground. Gripping the chin tight was the best way to avoid the two poisonous fangs. While the Graf resisted, it did not last long. I pulled the head out so Yeonhee could slice off its antennae with her dagger and then pulled down hard to expose the \u201cnape of its neck\u201d and stabbed the nerve center.\\n[You have been distributed two points.][Accumulated Points: 2]\u201cIt seemed that the Grafs that swarmed us when we were poisoned, were those living at the lair of the medium-sized Graf. I think we took care of half of the total now.\u201d\u201cI will see to it that no Graf runs away again.\u201d\u201cThat was not your fault.\u201dYeonhee told me to wait to replace her broken dagger with a new one. However, her hand came empty out of the backpack.\u201cI should have brought more.\u201dWith impeccable timing, several Grafs popped their ugly roach heads out from holes that suddenly appeared on the ground. Yeonhee had no time to aim and shoot as they were right at our feet. She grabbed an arrow and held it like a dagger, breaking off about half the length to a convenient, useful tool for stabbing. Despite the surprise, we had been hardened after surviving the Hell that was our first dungeon, and soon it was their corpses that littered the ground, not ours.Yeonhee\u2019s Agility class was about to increase, and she would need time to process the change after doing so. It might take days and weeks. Therefore, I had kept her from opening boxes but now we had no choice. We had to spin the roulette wheel, as she needed a good weapon. I spoke as we arrived at a new waterhole.\u201cYou need a weapon, let\u2019s open some boxes.\u201dShe nodded without complaint. Yeonhee washed up the reminders of the battle and came back. She has 2082 points now.\u201cUse them all to open Bronze Boxes.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s the goal?\u201dI told her, although it was really just a hope, as the odds were against us.\\n\u201cA weapon you can use. It\u2019s best if it is a dagger.\u201dShe got 3 Strength points, 1 Perception point, and 6 Agility points on her first three tries. She opened her eyes wide at remembering what having an E class Agility would entail.Follow new episodes on the lightnov\u200delworld.c\u200eom platform.\u201cI can only gain six points more in Agility. Shall I go on?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dYeonhee looked around as she was still wary of Grafs. Therefore, she shortened the ritual to washing her face and hands. It had worked up to now quite well.[Yeonhee Woo has given you a \u2018Reinforcement Insignia.\u2019]It was an F Class Reinforcement Insignia, and she would know its value without my explanation. Her ritual had worked again, and her smile told me this would be something she would keep doing in the future. I assumed she opened another Bronze Box, because I saw her watching the empty air in front of her, which meant a System message.Her eyes did not move as she stayed still. She probably got a skill, and I did not want to say that I had known something like this would happen.\u201c\u2026I got a first place completion award.\u201dThe Achievement for having eight skills for the first time was \u2018Jack of All Trades,\u2019 and the usual reward that every Awakened got for maxing out their skill slots had been worthless. All easy achievements were like that, but first and second place rewards were different. They were better.\u201cYou have achieved \u2018Jack of All Trades.\u2019 You have gained the Fulfilment Trait as your first time completion reward\u2026\u201dYeonhee\u2019s explanation follows below.[Fulfilment (Trait)\\nEffect: The cooldown time for all skills decreases by 10% at a very low probability if you inflict serious damage on an opponent.][Class: F(0)][Cooldown Time: 1 Day]It was something that would be given as a first-time completion reward.\u201cWhat\u2019s the skill?\u201dYeonhee looked confused as she had been when getting the Hate skill.Follow new episodes on the lightnov\u200belworld.c\u200com platform.\u201cConfusion.\u201dThe name told me it was an attack skill, and having two attack skills out of the eight was quite meaningful. We were definitely stepping out of the box.\u201cRemove Bravery.\u201dBravery was useless for me, actually harmful, and the possibility of points going there was an unnecessary risk.\u201cI did. Now, the last box.\u201dYeonhee fisted her hands, and who knew what would come out? Her gaze turned down to see a sharp dagger in her right hand. She blinked, and I whistled in my mind.She covered her mouth with a hand and jumped up and down. Her face turned red from stifling a shout. She showed the item to me with a shaking hand.\\n\u201cI\u2019m better. How many days have passed?\u201d\u201cThree.\u201d\u201c\u2026 I\u2019m a burden to you, right?\u201d\u201cI would have thrown you out by now if that were true. Eat and drink. Stop thinking like that. That\u2019s an order.\u201dI hoped at that time that we had passed the only crossroad then, and the left would lead straight to the boss fight. We were both nearing the end of our endurance, physical and mental.[You have gained 6 Stamina points.]I got that out of the dungeon box.**We saw Graf corpses as we walked back to the crossroad. Yeonhee was as quiet as I was, as we were now more careful than ever. During the three days, there had not been one scout. That was unthinkable for Grafs, and I believed the scouts had gone back after seeing the dead. If we had not been swarmed, it meant that they were lying in ambush. We did not know where, and it may happen at any time. They may be waiting to drop on us from the ceiling or waiting deep in the ground, and the question was how many. I had already activated Odin\u2019s Wrath. While walking forward, blue sparks crackled from my feet into the ground. While the attack may be ineffective, it was better than nothing. I was hoping it would drive them out of their hidden burrows\u2026\u201cGet ready.\u201dI spoke as we neared the crossroad. If there were no Grafs by now, we planned to rest there. I had been focusing on the ground as I walked with light steps when a Graf shot up right in front of me. Others followed suit, and the ground shook. Grafs jumped out from everywhere in front of us, but not from the rear. I saw their antennas in the ceiling, and the number was quite large. I saw nothing else but the monsters once the dust settled.Thankfully, we were not surrounded like the Graf\u2019s original plan.[You used Gaia\u2019s Will.]As the antennas twitched, I ran into them while using the Ruler\u2019s Ring and shooting the Devi\u2019s Knife at them.This content is taken from lightnov\u200belworld.c\u200bomRead at wuxiaworld.euPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Its remaining three legs were wading through the blood of its fellows as it crawled over the other Graf corpses and red drops flew everywhere. It was trying to kill me as I had been sitting and leaning against another corpse. I was paralyzed, and the Graf must have noticed that this was a chance to kill me.\\n[You have used the Ring of Flames.]The flame shot straight to the Graf, and the monster rolled into itself, like a pillbug, before the flame could hit it. The flame dissipated hitting the shell, and it uncurled itself like nothing had happened. It would have come to me, but it suddenly stopped to look around with its twitching antennae. Yeonhee must have used the Confusion skill.\u201cI\u2019ll take care of that.\u201dI heard the voice from above me. Yeonhee looked down on me standing on top of a pile of Graf corpses, and after that cool line, she jumped down to rush the Graf. She kept her balance despite the floor which looked like an abattoir, Graf blood splashed everywhere. The Graf only responded after she reached knife range. However, the Graf was too late as Yeonhee had cut off its antennae by the time it could respond.Yeonhee then immediately retreated. Several antennae crawled up to her, as those of other Grafs who were still breathing, yet had lost most or all their limbs, were searching for her instinctively. The only attack the antennae could do by themselves was to choke people, but it was long enough to be dangerous in numbers.Yeonhee calmly severed each and every antennae before carefully approaching the confused Graf. She climbed on its back like I did on the Middle-sized Graf and stabbed it several times at the neck.The Graf\u2019s head fell to the floor, and she only returned after confirming that every Graf nearby had been killed.[Yeonhee Woo used Physical Healing.]I managed to stand up, and my body felt like a ton. I could not raise my head, and the Man Who Overcame Adversity seemed to be laughing at me, as it had not activated.\u201cLet\u2019s move.\u201dYeonhee spoke as she supported me. We had taken care of over sixty Grafs, and I had killed most of them.\\nThe source of this content is lightnov\u200eelworld.c\u00adom**After three days of hell, I was finally myself again. I had been senseless for the past few days and suffered through nightmares. I saw the Graf I had seen in an A class dungeon in my past life, and that one had been called the Ruler Graf.It had a pale face and two suns for eyes, and anyone who had seen them would freeze in fear. Maybe because I had seen such a creature in my dreams, I felt less pressure against the F class boss monster. It might be possible I could do better than my estimates, as I was fighting like an E class hunter now.We finished cleaning up and moved back to the left passage at the intersection in the tunnels. No Graf attacked us, and it seemed we had taken care of them all. We had arrived at a place where four dungeon boxes lay. My suspicions were thus confirmed, and Yeonhee seemed to be thinking the same thing.\u201cIt\u2019s the boss fight soon, right?\u201dThe tunnels were narrowing again, and like where the Middle Graf had been, the boss monster would be waiting for us at the end of this road.\u201cWe haven\u2019t needed our Escape Insignias yet.\u201dYeonhee looked happy at our growth compared to our first dungeon, and her face was filled with tension and satisfaction.\u201cLet\u2019s get ready here.\u201dYeonhee did not know why I had chosen this place until she also saw the dungeon boxes and smiled. We rested for two days, because two boxes had curses, and we had to wait out Heal Fear\u2019s cooldown. On the third day, we started moving again.\\n[You have gained 9 Devi\u2019s Knife points.][Devi\u2019s Knife: F(9)]This content is taken from lightnov\u200belworld.c\u200dom\u201cIt\u2019s all right. I am opening the next box.\u201d[You have gained 10 stamina points.][Stamina: F(50).]Dungeon boxes could give you necessary stats like this or give two consecutive curses in a row. I signaled that I was all right to Yeonhee and checked my Status before moving on to the final boxes, which turned out to be consecutive curses.**The cave was now a path wide enough for six people to walk side by side, and I saw a long row of stone statues on each side. I had not expected a long corridor before the boss room, unlike anything I had seen before in my previous life. Yeonhee did not recognize the statues because each one was a Middle Graf.Damn. I began to sense what the boss fight may be like. In my past life, hunters would give up before boss fights because of situations like this. What could one do when a herd of Middle Grafs came to life, all at the same time? We would be crushed to death.\u201cStep back.\u201d\\n[The Man Who Overcame Adversity Activation Time: 0 hours 10 minutes]The messages came quickly about how all of my skills and stats increased by a level. I then knew the secret of Devi\u2019s Knife.[Devi\u2019s Knife (Skill)Effect: A sharp aura attack is shot. The User can change it to Shiva\u2019s Knife.Class: E(0)Cooldown Time: 5 minutes]Follow new episodes on the lightnov\u200celworld.c\u00adom platform.It was a simple sentence, but I had not seen the word change in the system before. Shiva\u2019s Knife? I remembered the battle earlier in this dungeon. The corpses that had exploded would have been due to this skill. Also, I could not hide a laugh at how the First Virtue, the owner of Devi\u2019s Knife in my past life, would have viewed the Seventh Evil with disdain. The Seventh Evil had been called Shiva the Destroyer as his main skill had been Shiva\u2019s Knife.So, Devi\u2019s Knife could change to another skill with each class increase, and I remembered some with a sharp grin. To think that this skill could change to another divine class skill\u2026how amazing was that?!
