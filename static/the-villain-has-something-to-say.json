Thunder and lightning traveled back and forth between the lead-like clouds, like silver snakes. The silence of the frozen atmosphere, without a hint of wind, resembled a stream frozen motionless.Several dozens of youths in clothes made out of sackcloth, walked on the cragged mountain road. They were hurrying with their heads buried, as if something dangerous lurked behind them, not even daring to turn their head once.\u201cHurry up! It\u2019s nearly time!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only half an hour left.\u201dSuch voices were heard everywhere from the procession. These young children were so anxious that their faces were covered in sweat. They continuously sped up their pace, wanting to pass through the mountain road, but the road was so long that it was like they would never stop walking, and there was no end in sight.The mountain walls around them seemed to reach through the clouds, except for one narrow road, which split between the walls, allowing these children to walk through. It was not long before many young girls collapsed, their body unable to endure the strain. However, an even greater number of people grit their teeth and moved forward with great efforts.\u201cHonglonglong\u2014\u201dA bolt of lightning, thick as a water jar, struck down in front of the procession on the mountain road, and split open a deep, huge pit in the ground. The sound of thunder rolled through the sky, growing louder and louder. The shaking lightning struck and lit the ground, making the tall young man at the very front shudder with fear.\u201cI won\u2019t go! I won\u2019t go! I\u2019ll die if this lightning strikes!\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t go either! I don\u2019t want to be an immortal, I don\u2019t want to join Tai Hua Mountain, I want to finish my trial!\u201d\u201cI want to finish my trial too!\u201dThe people who said \u201cfinish trial\u201d were able to dodge the silver rays of light, and quickly disappeared from the mountain road. The others advanced without delay, continuing their trials.Tai Hua Mountain was the cultivation world\u2019s number one sect. They opened their gates every ten years, accepting any child 15 years or younger for trials. As long as they passed three trials, these ordinary children could receive the chance to enter Tai Hua Mountain, and even instant success from then on, becoming the immortals that the common folk held so high in their hearts.Of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s three trials, the first two held no danger. However, the last one, \u201cLeiting Road\u201c, had children losing their lives every time it happened. The thunder and lightning were real thunder and lightning. These children had ordinary bodies, and they would undoubtedly die if lightning struck them. Not only that, but there was a time limit for walking through Leiting Road. If they went over the time limit, they still wouldn\u2019t pass the trial.There was still a quarter of an hour remaining, and there were still 31 children remaining on Leiting Road.And they were still a great distance away from the final destination, but the thunder continued to grow even more ferocious. Every time it struck, the heavens and earth alike trembled and shook, as if it were splitting through the mountain.A young girl in the group said timidly, face white with fear, \u201cBig brother Chen, can we give up? This lightning could kill someone\u2026\u201dA boy about 14 years old was walking in front of her. He heard her and turned around to face the girl.This young man was not too handsome, but he was well worth a second look. A shrewd light flickered in his eyes, looking oddly at the little girl in front of him. Finally, he laughed. \u201cLittle sister, you\u2019re not any better than them. Relax, we can both become immortals. Take my hand and walk.\u201dThe little girl still wanted to say something, but looking at how resolved the young man was, she swallowed her words.When they continued forward, a rumbling, thick bolt of lightning struck towards the young man at once. The girl trembled with fright, but surprisingly, she managed to summon her courage and suddenly put forward both hands to block the young man, shouting, \u201cBig brother Chen, be careful!\u201dThe lightning was no more than ten meters away from the girl, but she didn\u2019t notice. Behind her, the young man she was protecting smiled a little, showing no surprise. His eyes were filled with pride and anticipation, as if he was suppressing something restless.However, just as the lightning was about to strike the girl, the green glint of a sword cleaved the air!The sword\u2019s brilliance, swift and fierce, struck the violent lightning, silver sparks surging. That glint was ice cold and ruthless as it skewered the lightning. The green sword\u2019s tip majestically rang, and the children on the mountain road shook so hard they fell to the ground all at once, the lightning instantly fading away to nothing.The 31 people\u2019s eyes were wide open, staring in shock at the person who suddenly appeared in midair.Between the almost endless, split precipice, they could only see an immortal standing straight in the middle of the countless lightning and thunder rumbles, with white clothes and wide sleeves. His eyes gazed at the paralyzed trial takers sitting on the ground with indifference.He had phoenix eyes and long eyebrows, straight nose and thin lips, and the outer corners of his narrow eyes were slightly raised. Then a halo, black as ink, slowly spread out, making the children hold their breath, not daring to breathe. Black hair unable to act on its own, danced and swayed in the air, silver snakes of lightning and thunder behind him. This person bore the countless bolts of lightning without a care, and only looked serenely at the group of children, his eyes drooping.This was truly a noble man who did not feel any worldly ties, the peak of elegance and tranquility!Another bolt of lightning struck viciously. He took his sword behind him and shattered the approaching tumultuous lightning into pieces. His long silver sword danced in the air, creating a beautiful display of sparks. It gradually shrunk into a ribbon of silver light, rushing between his eyebrows with a whoosh, and left behind a silver design.On the entire Leiting Road, not one person dared say a word.The time limit of the trial had passed long ago, but this issue hadn\u2019t come to anyone\u2019s minds.It had not been long when three white-robed cultivators hurriedly flew over. Upon seeing that person, they immediately saluted, and yelled, \u201cSenior brother Luo!\u201dLuo Jianqing lightly nodded, hinting something towards the three people. Then he turned and continued to look at the children on Leiting Road, giving the crowd a glance, and quickly discovered the pair of trial takers that seemed to be brother and sister.Upon seeing this, the cultivator next to him immediately said in a low voice, \u201cThat young man is known as Li Xiuchen, 14 years old this year, and has an ordinary constitution. That girl is named Liu Xiaoxiao, 9 years old this year, and her constitution is considered to be third degree.\u201d His voice dropped, then continued, \u201cSenior brother Luo, we do not know what happened today on Leiting Road that it became so serious. If you had arrived later, I\u2019m afraid this young girl would\u2019ve unfairly lost her life here.\u201dTai Hua Mountain opened its gates once every ten years, but they didn\u2019t always accept new disciples each time. Although a third degree foundation is not any higher than first degree or second degree, their potential to become an immortal was still considered to be higher than an ordinary person\u2019s. Logically, they could enter Tai Hua Mountain to cultivate.Luo Jianqing heard his words, and he lightly glanced at the pair of brother and sister. Then he turned his head and started to speak. \u201cFortunately, I was returning to our sect. It was simply coincidental. This matter of Leiting Road still needs your careful examination to prevent any other mishaps in the future.\u201dHis voice was like a dreamlike sonata, like jade strings colliding, gentle and moving.The three immediately nodded in acknowledgement.After a moment, Luo Jianqing left on his sword. In a blink of an eye, he disappeared from Leiting Road.Once he left, it was like the world resumed moving again, without the intimidating and oppressive atmosphere.Liu Xiaoxiao swallowed her spit. Pulling on Li Xiuchen\u2019s sleeve, she said very cautiously, \u201cBig brother Chen, that big sister is really good-looking, are all immortals\u2026are all immortals that good-looking?\u201dLi Xiuchen\u2019s face was gloomy like water, and didn\u2019t respond.The girl didn\u2019t notice Li Xiuchen\u2019s strange behavior, and continued, \u201cIs that pretty big sister from Tai Hua Mountain? Big brother Chen, we have to join Tai Hua Mountain. She saved us, so we should thank her.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Li Xiuchen said coldly.Liu Xiaoxiao inhaled. \u201cBig brother Chen , you\u2019re grabbing me too hard, you\u2019re hurting me.\u201dLi Xiuchen slowly let go of the girl\u2019s hand, who had been pulling on him. He first turned his head to glance at the little girl beside him, then continued to walk. The girl was completely unaware of what happened, and muttered, \u201cBig brother Chen still isn\u2019t slowing down?\u201d then hurriedly followed after him.\u2014This was wrong! Completely and utterly wrong!The little girl never knew that her life should\u2019ve ended there in order to block her favorite big brother Chen from that bolt of lightning.What happened at Leiting Road was an anomaly: it had suddenly become much more dangerous, and the Li Xiuchen with ordinary constitution was nearly struck by lightning, but was saved by his dear childhood friend, his little sister Liu Xiaoxiao. Liu Xiaoxiao should\u2019ve wilted like a flower, then Li Xiuchen would cry and lament painfully. This act would be seen by the eyes of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s immortals, and then they would resolve to make an exception to let this ordinary boy through their gates.\u2014That was exactly what happened in the plot of \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d.Three years ago, Li Xiuchen had not been called Li Xiuchen. An accident caused him to cross into \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d. When he found out that he had been turned into Li Xiuchen, he was so excited that he couldn\u2019t control himself.Li Xiuchen! \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d\u2019s protagonist! He possessed a super golden finger rivalled by none! It was practically like he was the heavens\u2019 favorite child!Three years later, he earnestly led a life based upon his memories of the plot. Afterwards, he brought the little sister Liu Xiaoxiao from next door to join him in Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s trials. He had been prepared to sacrifice this little girl to let himself inside the gates.But now, why was everything not right? Where exactly did he go wrong?Why did Luo Jianqing appear now!At that very moment, that mistakenly named white-robed immortal \u201cbig sister\u201d had already flown away from Leiting Road long ago, and stepped inside Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s gates. Senior and junior brothers all around enthusiastically greeted him, every one of which he gently replied to. His handsome face carried a genial smile, beautiful as a woman, face like a spring blossom, brilliant and gentle.However, after Luo Jianqing stepped inside his room, his sleeves flew as he violently slammed the door shut.The smile on his face instantly faded without a trace. Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes were ice cold as he turned his head to look at the desk not far from him. He narrowed his eyes, and a heavy book instantly flew into his hands. On the cover, there were two impressive large words written with spirit\u2014\u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d.Luo Jianqing was the chief disciple of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Yu Xiao Peak, and the last disciple of the top person of the cultivation world. Because of jealousy towards his junior brother Li Xiuchen, he betrayed his school and became a monster. Many years later, a group led by Li Xiuchen sought to kill Luo Jianqing. After enduring a violent battle lasting ten days and ten nights, he died under Li Xiuchen\u2019s sword. It could even be said that his death was justified, and died to everyone\u2019s satisfaction!But right now\u2026The corners of Luo Jianqing\u2019s lips turned up in an easy smile, looking at the sparkling words \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d with an indifferent gaze.\u201cI, Luo Jianqing, have returned.\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter a day, a little junior brother came running to tell Luo Jianqing that the mistake at Leiting Road was a complete accident.As the cultivation\u2019s world number one sect, Tai Hua Mountain accepted disciples from anywhere under the sun once every ten years. Ten years to cultivators was nothing more than one bout of seclusion. This manner of accepting disciples naturally made it impossible to have the sect elders handle it directly, so they handed all of them over to the younger generation of disciples.Luo Jianqing was Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s chief disciple, but was also the only disciple of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s seventh peak, Yu Xiao Peak. Ten years ago, he had also handled these matters at one point, but this time he was fortunate enough to be out traveling. Thus, this mission fell to Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s third senior sister, Wei Qiongyin.However, a mishap occurred at Leiting Road.The disciple in charge of activating Leiting Road with spiritual stones was careless and put in medium-grade spiritual stones to serve as low-grade spiritual stones. This led to the sudden increase in danger and nearly turned it into a disaster.Wei Qiongyin knew that she had made a mistake in her direction, and for her punishment, she had to run to Siguo Cliff to meditate for a month, and thus the matters of the all-peak examinations were given to Luo Jianqing.Listening to Wei Qiongyin\u2019s voice transmission (1) that had traveled across a thousand miles, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t know whether to cry or laugh.\u201cSenior brother Luo, of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s seven peaks, your Yu Xiao Peak is the most idle. This time was my mistake. I must be punished. According to our head martial uncle, I ask you to help me with the all-peak examinations. Many thanks. Wei Qiongyin.\u201dWho would tell someone \u201cyou are the most idle\u201d and still ask for help?It seems that Wei Qiongyin was just like the one in his past life \u2013 she still only knew how to cultivate and not how to conduct herself.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t reject this matter. In fact, he had handled the all-peak examinations in his past life. He stared blankly at the child with ordinary constitution that seemed to have saint-like generosity. In just a short ten days, his strength had progressed enormously. In the end, one move had turned him into the second ranked in the all-peak examinations and directly stepped into Yu Xiao Peak, becoming Yu Xiao Peak\u2019s second disciple.Three days ago, Luo Jianqing had woken up in the middle of a pile of carcasses.All over his body, his bones felt like they were going to be crushed, his head felt like it weighed a thousand jin (2), the white robe on his body was covered in mud and soaked in thick blood, and he was surrounded by hundreds of dead beasts. Luo Jianqing had thought that he was in hell, but when he found his spiritual energy starting up automatically, he was overjoyed. At the same time, he suddenly remembered where this place was\u2014The Wan Shou Mountains.Many years ago, he often liked to come to the Wan Shou Mountains and kill demons, so much that he wouldn\u2019t return for two or three years at a time.There was no one to punish him if he killed demons at the Wan Shou Mountains. Demonic cultivators also came here to hunt and kill human cultivators, as it was an unregulated area. Also, there were often human cultivators and demonic cultivators that came here to settle grudges. Massacres occurred here, and no one was likely to show any self-restraint.After waking up, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t get up right away, and sat in the middle of the pile of beast carcasses, while thinking about what happened in his past life. He already knew that he had gone back eighteen years in the past, when Li Xiuchen still hadn\u2019t joined Tai Hua Mountain or become his junior brother yet.And now, he was just in time for that important week when Li Xiuchen joined the sect!After realizing this point, Luo Jianqing hastily moved to prepare his return to Tai Hua Mountain, to prevent Li Xiuchen from joining his sect. Who would\u2019ve guessed that one step after he got up, not having gotten on his sword yet, that he suddenly felt like something was falling from the sky, which smashed directly into his body.Luo Jianqing raised his hands and grabbed what he thought was some kind of secret weapon. He glanced downwards. \u201cSeeking Immortality?\u201dAfter opening up the book, Luo Jianqing\u2019s entire life was completely turned upside down.His world was a book! And it was a stallion novel devoid of the rules, logic, or any of the three views (3)!When Li Xiuchen raised his head, he received a blessing. When he lowered his head, there was a spiritual beast. Ever since he first stepped into Tai Hua Mountain, he was like a fish back in water. He had practically snatched all the luck under the heavens. In this book, when every young lady met him, they treated him unfavorably. But there was always an opportunity for Li Xiuchen to heroically save the beauty, making their opinions change so drastically that they pledged their hearts to him.After finishing the book, Luo Jianqing did not feel well. His beautiful elegant face was filled with rage, and his phoenix eyes were squeezed tight. Then he took his sword and killed a demonic cultivator who had been secretly preparing to attack him. Afterwards he hurried to fly back to his sect on his sword.However, \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d didn\u2019t seem to be very complete, and only told the story of Li Xiuchen replacing Luo Jianqing and turning into Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s beloved little junior brother. Luo Jianqing knew that after that, he would be framed by Li Xiuchen time and time again. Then he lost his temper and impulsively hacked Li Xiuchen\u2019s only spiritual beast to death, and also caused Li Xiuchen to be injured critically in the Hidden Realm, and so he was driven out from Tai Hua Mountain.\u2014Obviously there was a guarded treasure in the Hidden Realm, because this matter had come up during his huge fight with Li Xiuchen. In the end, he had unexpectedly turned it into a sneak attack against Li Xiuchen!The entire time he was traveling from Wan Shou Mountains back to Tai Hua Mountain, Luo Jianqing had read \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d front to back twelve times.The feeling of being stabbed through the heart in his past life still remained in his memory, but this time he refused to let something like that happen again.Before he arrived at Leiting Road, Luo Jianqing recalled Li Xiuchen very quickly, who had killed him with his sword. But this was merely a thought, and there were many junior brothers and sisters at that moment watching him at Leiting Road, so he couldn\u2019t slip and behave strangely in that manner. Thus Luo Jianqing changed the course of the story so that guileless little girl who would\u2019ve been struck by lightning, wouldn\u2019t die a tragic death.Although\u2026\u201cSenior brother Luo, this is the roster of this year\u2019s new disciples. Please look it over.\u201dLuo Jianqing looked down at the dozens of names, and upon seeing the words \u201cLi Xiuchen\u201d his lips twitched slightly. Smiling as he raised his eyes to meet the little junior brother, he said genially, \u201cI remember that this Li Xiuchen\u2019s constitution is quite ordinary, yet he entered this sect?\u201dLooking at his fair and elegant face and that smile that was cold as wind, the little junior brother couldn\u2019t help but swallow. His voice quivered as he said, \u201cAlthough Li Xiuchen\u2019s constitution is not good, he passed Leiting Road. Senior brother Luo, after you took it upon yourself to stop the lightning, Leiting Road was quick to close itself. Therefore you have received 14 junior brothers and sisters altogether.\u201d He had received nearly all the last ones who took the trial.Luo Jianqing raised his eyebrows, not saying anything else. The little junior brother watched him with a reverent and admiring gaze. By the time he had left Luo Jianqing\u2019s room, he had turned his head six times. What he said was: Three days after the all-peak examinations, he would come ask Luo Jianqing to take charge of them.Luo Jianqing agreed to his requests one after another. When his junior brother left, the smile on his lips swiftly vanished.He sighed heavily and got up to leave Yu Xiao Peak. It had only been half a day since he came back, and already he had more business to settle.After three days, the examinations started on schedule.24 newcomers stood in the arena below, sizing up their peers around them with curious eyes. Out of these 24 newcomers, there were no more than eight girls, including the most lovable one, Liu Xiaoxiao, who was also very eye-catching. Next to her, a boy who had been dragged to her side the entire time, was talking and not really paying attention to the people next to him.Even if this boy may be outstanding, Li Xiuchen actually had an ordinary constitution, which was reflected in his looks.This made many people pay attention to his arrival, wanting to see how this guy had such good luck with women, what made this new female disciple with a third degree constitution like him so much.\u201cBig brother Chen, did you practice your techniques well enough? I feel like you don\u2019t know them very well. Don\u2019t you think something might go wrong today?\u201dLi Xiuchen carelessly nodded. \u201cMn.\u201dSeeing how the other person didn\u2019t seem to care, Liu Xiaoxiao\u2019s little face frowned sadly. \u201cBig brother Chen, didn\u2019t you say that if we joined Tai Hua Mountain, we could become immortals, and then my parents could live happily? But yesterday that senior brother said we couldn\u2019t go home whenever we wanted to.\u201dLi Xiuchen said unhappily, \u201cYou\u2019ll be able to go home sooner or later.\u201dWhen Li Xiuchen spoke those words, he didn\u2019t spare any glance for Liu Xiaoxiao, making this little girl, who wasn\u2019t even 10 years old yet, feel very hurt.Liu Xiaoxiao didn\u2019t know what was going on with her Chen-gege. Before Leiting Road, Chen-gege had always treated her with special care. In the past three years, he would always care about and cherish her. But nowadays, Li Xiuchen seemed like he never wanted to pay attention to her. She followed Li Xiuchen so she could let her parents live out their days comfortably, but she didn\u2019t recognize this person at all.In a moment, every kind of bitter emotion sprang up from her heart. After all, she was only an eight or nine year old little girl. Liu Xiaoxiao blinked, and tears fell from her eyes. But once she opened her eyes, she saw that lively white-clothed beautiful person, and widened her eyes in surprise. She shouted loudly, \u201cBig sister! Big brother Chen, come look! It\u2019s the big sister who saved us!\u201dThough Liu Xiaoxiao\u2019s voice wasn\u2019t quiet at all, most of the disciples there had refining levels higher than hers, so their hearing was excellent, hearing her words very clearly.\u201cBig\u2026 big sister? This little girl called senior brother Luo a big sister?\u201d\u201cHahahaha, really, our senior brother Luo is that charming and carefree. Indeed he is the man of countless women\u2019s dreams, in all thirty six prefectures.\u201d\u201cThe first day I entered Tai Hua Mountain I thought senior brother Luo was some senior sister who liked to wear men\u2019s clothes, he is truly very good-looking\u2026\u201dUpon hearing these words, Luo Jianqing immediately looked distracted. Astonished, he lowered his head to look at the young girl in the arena, only seeing the latter tightly hugging her Chen-gege\u2019s arm, happily waving her arm continuously.He was thin and a meter taller than her, yet this little girl who was like a small bean sprout, called him a big sister?!A young man in black clothes chuckled, and moved close to Luo Jianqing to say in his ear, \u201cSenior brother, this little girl has an excellent way of looking at things.\u201dLuo Jianqing glanced at him while his head was down. The black-clothed young man immediately spread his hands innocently, not saying another word. Luo Jianqing returned to calmly sweeping his eyes over the arena, and his junior brothers and sisters who had been whispering quietly quickly shut up as well.However, there were still people who were secretly sending voice transmissions, conversing in stealth. Luo Jianqing could guess what they were saying even with his eyes closed. His lips turned up in a small smile, and walked up to the middle of the tall platform, accepting a white crystal into his upturned palm.Beneath the glorious and brilliant sunlight, the tall, handsome young man wearing a silver-lined white chang pao surveyed his junior brothers and sisters with a mild gaze. His extremely fair face seemed as carefree as a bird, so beautiful that people couldn\u2019t take their eyes off him. In reality, his powerful and dominating aura made people think twice about their actions, having no choice but to gaze at him with reverence.Luo Jianqing lightly waved the white crystal in his hand, saying, \u201cThe six peaks of Tai Hua Mountain accepting disciples in the all-peak examinations is a major event during this important time. Therefore, you must avoid any secret underhanded behavior by all means. If this voice transmission stone lights up, don\u2019t blame my ruthlessness when I put you under my sword. I\u2019ll send you to see your gentlest senior sister Wei.\u201dThe crowd of disciples shut up immediately. \u201c\u2026\u201dOn the Siguo Cliff far away, Wei Qiongyin was silent as she was helplessly being ridiculed. \u201c\u2026\u201dThe black-clothed young man next to him said, \u201cHehe, senior brother, you really abuse your position. We can\u2019t even send voice transmissions? And our gentlest senior sister Wei? If senior sister Wei was so gentle, then no man under the heavens would be more infatuated than me.\u201dLuo Jianqing turned his head to look at his own junior brother, and said seriously, \u201cFourth junior brother, I could pass on what you just said to third junior sister.\u201dXie Zizhuo\u2019s face flooded with fright. \u201cSenior brother Luo you\u2019re a bully!!!\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled wordlessly.This was just a brief interlude, as after a short period of time, the all-peak examinations officially began after Luo Jianqing\u2019s announcement.24 new disciples drew lots to fight on-stage one after another, as previously, to demonstrate their progress in cultivation over the past ten days to the senior brothers and sisters of the six peaks. The winner could continue in the next competition, and if they were talented enough, they could even be taken in by an elder as their last disciple.The disciples that were accepted must not have any cultivation base, even if they were a young master or young lady of a large family. At most, they were allowed to learn self-defense techniques, but weren\u2019t allowed to have even a bit of spiritual power. Thus, the all-peak examination this time was to see every disciple\u2019s strength and their effort during the ten days, which was unusually fair.Anyway, these disciples didn\u2019t have any cultivation base, so fights like these weren\u2019t anything interesting.Most of the female disciples secretly looked at the platform towards the eminent white-clothed senior brother. Luo Jianqing was completely calm, playing with the sound transmission stone in his hands. His lips carried a smile, and his expression serene, as he looked at what was happening on the arena.After a long time, it was finally time for the boy with ordinary constitution, the unexpectedly fortunate Li Xiuchen, to come up to the platform. Luo Jianqing\u2019s hands suddenly came to a halt, which Xie Zizhuo keenly noticed. He turned to look at Li Xiuchen, and said with a low smile, \u201cIt seems that senior brother is very interested in that boy with the worst constitution out of everyone here.\u201dLuo Jianqing raised an eyebrow. \u201cDo you think he can win?\u201dXie Zizhuo laughed out loud. \u201cIf he won, I would practice seclusion for a year!\u201dLuo Jianqing waved a hand. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be so dramatic. Accompanying your senior sister Wei at Siguo Cliff is good enough.\u201dXie Zizhuo\u2019s eyes were wide open. \u201cSenior brother Luo, you\u2019re a bully!!!\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s lips raised in a soft smile, seeming to be completely relaxed. However, even Xie Zizhuo didn\u2019t know that Luo Jianqing\u2019s gaze had always been fixed on Li Xiuchen. Watching this mediocre, ordinary boy walk up to the arena with a gloomy face, Li Xiuchen stared at the opponent across from him with a complicated look.Luo Jianqing\u2019s smile slowly dwindled, a dark glint flashing through his clear and limpid eyes.\u201c\u2026You don\u2019t have anything of that kind, Li Xiuchen. What will you do now?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 3": "Chapter 3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe next day, the 24 newcomers competed one after another on the arena, and every single one did not have any foundation for spiritual power. This sort of competition was very dull, and the great majority of official disciples were bored stiff watching. In fact, by the time it was Li Xiuchen\u2019s turn, many people didn\u2019t even look at him.There was only Luo Jianqing, whose gaze had been concentrated on this ordinary-looking young man this entire time.Throughout the entirety of his past life, Luo Jianqing never understood how a young man with such a mediocre constitution could oppress the stars in the all-peak examinations with average strength, or how he received second place. Even though none of the other disciples had any spiritual power, there were many new disciples among them that had come from clans who studied martial arts techniques since childhood, and their strength far exceeded that of an ordinary person\u2019s.However, Luo Jianqing was actually the only one who had achieved Qi Condensation level in ten days!Among the 36 provinces, the human cultivators were divided into nine levels: namely, Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, Out-of-Body, Body Fusion, Calamity Passage(1), Mahayana, and Immortal Ascension. Every level had their own sub-levels: namely the initial stage, the middle stage, and the last stage, except the Qi Condensation period was divided into nine phases, from Qi Condensation Phase One to Phase Nine.In his past life, there were 23 disciples altogether (apart from the deceased Liu Xiaoxiao), and surprisingly only the worst one, Li Xiuchen, had reached Qi Condensation! And not only was Li Xiuchen born in poverty, but there wasn\u2019t any good environment for children in his family to cultivate. Just like a fantasy story.Nowadays, after reading \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d, Luo Jianqing finally understood why.How could\u2019ve he said that? It was simply because Li Xiuchen was a child of the heavens!See a magic potion when he raises his head, meet a spiritual beast when he lowers it \u2014 this was the truth when it came to him.Li Xiuchen and the rest of the new disciples were temporarily assigned as outer disciples of Tai Hua Mountain to cultivate for ten days. This is what \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d said: Due to his dear childhood friend\u2019s tragic death, Li Xiuchen was determined to become strong, working hard to cultivate every day. However, his innate skill was actually very low, and there was a huge difference between him cultivating for eight days and someone else cultivating for one day. Therefore, the night before the all-peak examinations started, he went to the back of the mountain to entertain himself, and then\u2026 he stepped on a medicine pill!The Spirit-Melting Pill.This was considered to be the most common medicine pill, and what Li Xiuchen also didn\u2019t know was that some medicine master had accidentally left it behind, which was how he found it.The Spirit-Melting Pill was a very average, level one medicine pill. If 10,000 of these were put in front of Luo Jianqing he wouldn\u2019t give them a second glance. But he was no match for the glittering MC halo! This Spirit-Melting Pill wasn\u2019t too bad; actually, it was a heaven-rank Spirit-Melting Pill! After Li Xiuchen took it, his meridians were cleansed and became stronger overnight, and officially stepped into the first level of cultivation!When he got to this point in the book, Luo Jianqing was speechless.A heaven-rank Spirit-Melting Pill, huh!On the entire Tai Hua Mountain, the Qing Lan Peak Lord, the honorable Yu Qingzi was able to refine medicine. But how could a great master who could refine a heaven-rank Spirit-Melting Pill, possibly refine a level one Spirit-Melting Pill? Not only that, but did that old woman have nothing to do than look for outer disciples strolling around at the back of the mountain, and casually drop a heaven-rank medicine pill on the way?Where is the logic?! Where is the reasoning?! This made no sense at all!Therefore, three days ago, Luo Jianqing left Yu Xiao Peak without a word, and headed to the back of the mountain to gather items.Someone, not just Li Xiuchen, would\u2019ve stepped on that heaven-rank medicine pill at some point, but Luo Jianqing had practically overturned the entire mountain to look for it. Finally after an entire night, he found the gold, glittering medicine pill. This pill was truly extraordinary as it said, the will of the heavens was so slanted that you couldn\u2019t see its face!After using his spiritual sense to examine it, he put the heaven-rank Spirit-Melting Pill inside his storage ring. Luo Jianqing\u2019s thin lips curved up slightly, blossoming into a tranquil and easy smile. His umber-black eyebrows lightly smoothed out, his phoenix eyes curving so they resembled crescent moons. Seeing this, the hearts of many female disciples toppled one after another. However, Luo Jianqing\u2019s gaze had been fixed on what was happening on the arena, not even the slightest bit distracted.And so he said, you don\u2019t have the Spirit-Melting Pill, so how will you defeat your opponent as an ordinary person?Luo Jianqing\u2019s jade-like slender fingers gently rapped against the black iron table. His eyes slightly narrowed, and his smiling expression was profound.In the arena, Li Xiuchen was gloomy, his entire heart restless. He nearly wanted to go back and read \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d again.\u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d was a very well-known stallion novel with a super golden finger. In his past life Li Xiuchen read it no less than ten times. He went over the details in his mind over and over, but nothing particular came up. He clearly remembered that on the ninth day, he had walked around the back of Tai Hua Mountain, then stepped on the heaven-rank Spirit-Melting Pill and raised his cultivation in one go. But yesterday, he spent the entire night walking around the back of Tai Hua Mountain where the outer disciples were. Don\u2019t even mention a heaven-rank medicine pill, he didn\u2019t even see a single spiritual root!Can you really say he isn\u2019t depressed? Can you really say he isn\u2019t sullen?Without the heaven-rank Spirit-Melting Pill, how could he win against these disciples who were raised in clans?His constitution was nothing special at all!\u201cTenth match of the Tai Hua Mountain new disciple all-peak examinations. Xu Hua from Changzhou, fourth-degree constitution: Li Xiuchen from Yuzhou, no constitution.\u201dAfter the voice fell, the senior brothers who were judging them retreated a step back to give the newcomers some space. Seeing the sturdy built Xu Hua across from him, Li Xiuchen\u2019s face twitched: He didn\u2019t have a single thick arm! How is he going to fight him? He was no better than a punching bag!On the high platform, two people were watching this massive gap in strength. Xie Zizhuo chuckled, completely covered in black, and moved close to mutter quietly in Luo Jianqing\u2019s ear, \u201cSenior brother, didn\u2019t I say this earlier? How could you say he might have a chance to win? That Xu Hua\u2019s constitution is fourth-degree, and his cultivation is already a level higher, but Li Xiuchen doesn\u2019t have any constitution at all, and he is short and small. If he wins, wouldn\u2019t the heavens be too biased?\u201dLuo Jianqing turned his head to look at Xie Zizhuo, his fair and elegant eyes softly curving into a smile. He looked at his sloppy-looking junior brother with a smile that wasn\u2019t quite right. \u201cAre you so sure that he\u2019ll lose?\u201dXie Zizhuo said like it was obvious, \u201cOf course. If he does win, tomorrow I\u2019ll go to Siguo Cliff and accompany senior sister Wei!\u201dLuo Jianqing feigned surprise, raising his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take that large a gamble?\u201dXie Zizhuo said mysteriously, \u201cYes, I will. Anyway, senior brother Luo, if you end up being wrong\u2026 I want the jade ox comb you use everyday.\u201dThe corners of Luo Jianqing\u2019s lips pulled into a smile. \u201c\u2026\u201dXie Zizhuo saw his senior brother\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t be such a pervert\u201d expression. He immediately waved his hand and made himself clear. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I want, it\u2019s what little junior sister wants. Senior brother, did you know that little junior sister has been in love with you since she was young? Otherwise she would never refine. I don\u2019t want this to happen ever, so you can argue with her, but her ultimate wish is to use your jade ox comb.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Why would little junior sister possibly want my jade ox comb?\u201dXie Zizhuo\u2019s eyes widened, and said in disbelief, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she? If Yu Xiao Peak wasn\u2019t so strict, our little junior sister would never go up. Do you believe me when I say that she would even climb up in the middle of the night to peep you!\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dXie Zizhuo\u2019s words were still coming like an unending torrent. He was obviously talking about how his own little junior sister was so wretched and perverted, but he didn\u2019t have a single bit of disdain in his words. Instead, it was more accurate to say he sighed with pride. \u201cLittle junior sister is so willful. If I was even half as bold as her, I would\u2019ve visited Cang Shuang Peak everyday.\u201dHearing his words made Luo Jianqing smile wordlessly, but in his heart, a bitter moodiness started to stir.He had been very close with his little junior sister since they were young. Before she became of marriageable age, she declared that she wouldn\u2019t ever marry. But his little junior sister was married to Li Xiuchen until the end, becoming his wife with her hair tied and all(2). He never expected that from his proud and stubborn little junior sister, and her husband still took nine more wives after that. Luo Jianqing heard his little junior sister was very generous in taking care of Li Xiuchen along with other sisters, but he couldn\u2019t imagine anything like that.Under that blue sky and scorching sun, Li Xiuchen held a heaven-rank medicine pill in his hand as he said to him with arrogance, \u201cLuo Jianqing, though you are Qing Lan Peak\u2019s inheriting great disciple, these medicine pills you have been enjoying throughout your life are now with me. Don\u2019t feel any regret.\u201d He was that kind of person. Those red clothes were as bright as fire. Was it possible that he actually enjoyed being superior to Li Xiuchen until the very end?\u2014Because he was a hero that saved beauties! Because the poison of desire ran through his body!How were the heavens ever unfair? The heavens were only fair towards Li Xiuchen!His elegant, pale face was slowly covered in a layer of grief, only to fade away in an instant. Luo Jianqing watched Li Xiuchen with a complex expression. Not knowing why, he said without thinking, \u201cFine, if he loses, I\u2019ll give you my jade ox comb.\u201dXie Zizhuo had been earnestly trying to persuade him, and from time to time he would pull Wei Qiongyin in, saying things like, \u201cAccompanying senior sister Wei is such a scary thought. Senior brother Luo, it\u2019s lucky that you won\u2019t lose anything by giving me your jade ox comb.\u201d Hearing Luo Jianqing suddenly agree made him elated beyond belief, and looked towards the arena with excitement.But in the next second\u2014The tall and strong Xu Hua suddenly covered his stomach. \u201cAh\u2026 it hurts! Judges\u2026 senior brothers, please give me a moment!\u201dJudges, \u201c\u2026\u201dLi Xiuchen, \u201c\u2026\u201dXie Zizhuo was stunned. \u201c\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing was completely silent. \u201c\u2026\u201dEven though he had guessed before that the heavens were biased all the way to the other end of China, he didn\u2019t think they would be this biased!Li Xiuchen\u2019s first match ended as the other person\u2019s stomach hurt too much, winning without a fight!Li Xiuchen\u2019s second match ended just as the other person made a move and suddenly sprained his waist, winning without a fight!Li Xiuchen\u2019s third match was against Liu Xiaoxiao. Just as Liu Xiaoxiao extended her hand to strike Li Xiuchen\u2019s arm, he howled in pain, scaring Liu Xiaoxiao into pulling back her hand and asking timidly, \u201cBig brother Chen, are you okay?\u201d After that, Li Xiuchen moved to subdue her.Everyone watching was completely silent. \u201c\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing sighed. \u201c\u2026\u201dXie Zizhuo was inconsolable and indignant. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair! This is just luck! Everything\u2019s only been luck!\u201dLuo Jianqing gently shook his head and laughed, \u201cJunior brother, as we immortals say, luck is always power.\u201dXie Zizhuo watched the arena, fuming with anger. He said furiously, \u201cThere\u2019s only three people left. The other two are both children of the eighth largest aristocratic family. I don\u2019t believe it. One has a first-degree constitution, and the other has a second-degree constitution. How could they be worse than a terrible little boy with no constitution?\u201dLi Xiuchen\u2019s fourth opponent happened to be excused, naturally winning without a fight.Xie Zizhuo was silent as tears streamed down his cheeks. \u201c\u2026\u201dBelow, the entire arena was filled with muttering, and many people were pointing at Li Xiuchen. The little girl Liu Xiaoxiao hadn\u2019t stopped rubbing her aching stomach, and wasn\u2019t sitting so close to her big brother Chen anymore. Li Xiuchen\u2019s palm had ruthlessly struck her body. Although she was young and only knew how to depend on her familiar big brother Chen , she wasn\u2019t stupid.That palm of Li Xiuchen really didn\u2019t hurt that much, but she was very upset, her small pretty face completely broken-hearted.What happened wasn\u2019t anything different from his past life. Li Xiuchen got second place yet again in the all-peak examinations, bound to become an inner disciple. After that, Li Xiuchen beamed with happiness, and muttered proudly, \u201cSo this is the protagonist halo, huh? This is really cool! Hehehehe.\u201dLuo Jianqing was watching Li Xiuchen\u2019s immensely proud face with complex feelings in his heart. After watching him for a long time, he slowly started to smile. He raised his head, looking towards the clear blue sky, as if he could see things from the ancient past in the dark blue sky. His delicate, beautiful face held only a gentle smile.He came in second place again this time, but already, there were some things that were different.In his past life, after Li Xiuchen got second place, the disciples on the stage below all exclaimed in admiration. A new junior brother without any constitution was shining on the arena above, becoming the only disciple to achieve Qi Condensation. This encouraging event made people cannot help but admire him. And many people also knew that this junior brother had just lost his childhood friend, so they were sympathetic towards him.But now?\u201cThis guy is really lucky, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah, that guy is pretty vicious. He just struck down that little girl he knew in the arena.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll become an inner disciple with second place, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be so lucky in the future.\u201dLuo Jianqing took in these mutterings without a word, a small smile on his face. Xie Zizhuo stood at his side, so depressed that he had been paralyzed above his chair. He said, dispirited, \u201cThe heavens aren\u2019t fair, the heavens really are too unfair. This kind of luck is something that I, Xie Zizhuo, has never heard of! The heavens aren\u2019t fair!\u201dLuo Jianqing laughed once, and said tranquilly, \u201cJunior brother, the heavens have never been fair.\u201dOriginally, Xie Zizhuo only spoke without thinking, and didn\u2019t expect to receive an answer from Luo Jianqing. He raised his head to look at his senior brother, and saw a despondent look on his face for just an instant. Then Luo Jianqing smiled bitterly, saying, \u201cIf the heavens are not fair, then make them fair. Junior brother, our cultivation is due to ourselves, not the will of the heavens. Do you understand what I just said?\u201dXie Zizhuo was startled for a moment, then respectfully nodded, without any trace of his carelessness from before. \u201cYes.\u201dThe all-peak examinations had ended.The best six of the examinations all became inner disciples, the rest having become outer disciples. And the top three could pick wherever they wanted to go, going from first to third in order. The first place winner came from a powerful family, with a first-degree constitution, and immediately chose the peak of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s sect leader, Cang Shuang Peak. The inheriting disciple from Cang Shuang Peak came and took him away.Next was Li Xiuchen.Luo Jianqing stood on the center of the high platform, his handsome face calm and collected as he said neutrally, \u201cIn the past ten days, there should\u2019ve been an inner disciple that told you the main circumstances of our Tai Hua Mountain. Since you have come in second place in the all-peak examinations, we will let you choose from Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s six peaks. Which one do you wish to go to?\u201dUnlike the first place disciple, no one said a word after Luo Jianqing\u2019s voice fell.All of the senior brothers and sisters of the six peaks that came to receive the new disciples were all mute, staring oddly at Li Xiuchen, who was on the stage. They didn\u2019t really like this weak junior brother, and no one wanted to personally help him get stronger. Could they take this boy by the neck and make him go back? Would his luck be as good as today\u2019s in the future?This situation was entirely different from the one in his past life. At that time, everyone was clamoring for Li Xiuchen, but now no one was showing any interest. Luo Jianqing\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change as he watched Li Xiuchen, showing neither sorrow nor joy. Like a god in the frosty skies, his imposing manner and neutral expression were oppressing.However, exactly the same as his past life, Li Xiuchen humbly cupped his hands in greeting, saying seriously, \u201cSenior brother, I heard that Tai Hua Mountain has seven peaks altogether. Why do you say I\u2019m allowed to pick one out of the six peaks?\u201dOnce his words fell to the ground, everyone was in an uproar.For a while now, Luo Jianqing had felt ice-cold and cutting in his heart, but he said with a tender smile, \u201cThe Yu Xiao Peak where I reside does not accept disciples. I am the only one, so go ahead and choose from the other six peaks.\u201dAfter hearing these words, pleasant surprise flashed through Li Xiuchen\u2019s eyes. Feigning indifference, he continued, \u201cSenior brother, I would like to enter Yu Xiao Peak. Sir Xuan Lingzi is rivaled by none, challenging demonic cultivators with his own strength, a model for us cultivators. I will not hide from you, senior brother, that I greatly admire him. In fact, I came to Tai Hua Mountain just to study under Sir Xuan Lingzi. Even if I became an odd-jobs disciple, I would be most willing.\u201dWhen this happened in his past lifetime, Luo Jianqing was so angry that the spiritual energy in his body rebelled, a flick of his sleeve nearly sending the boy falling to his death.His accomplishments since birth had been excellent, he had extraordinary patience, but his only weakness was that person. Li Xiuchen had hit his sore spot just right, and he couldn\u2019t help but grow furious. He injured Li Xiuchen, then that person, who had never left the gates before, suddenly left Yu Xiao Peak to go back and personally treat Li Xiuchen. Then he told him in a neutral voice, \u201cJianqing, from now on, he will be your junior brother.\u201dIn his past life, he was framed countless times by Li Xiuchen. though there was only one thing that Li Xiuchen said that was right.\u2014He hated Li Xiuchen. He hated that Li Xiuchen had become that person\u2019s disciple, sharing that position reserved only for him.The past floated like clouds in front of his eyes and passed in a flash. Luo Jianqing lowered his head to look at Li Xiuchen. He saw that the latter was looking at him with slight fear, but his eyes also had a trace of expectation, like he was waiting for something. Yet this time, Luo Jianqing merely sighed heavily. Under his sleeves, his fingernails tightly clenched his palm. He said with a gentle smile, \u201cYu Xiao Peak has never accepted any disciples. Junior brother, pick another one.\u201dLi Xiuchen was instantly stupefied.This entire time, he had been waiting for Luo Jianqing to attack, and then Xuan Lingzi would come to help resolve the dispute with Luo Jianqing, while simultaneously bringing him into Yu Xiao Peak. How did Luo Jianqing never raise a hand against him all this time? Perhaps he had passed into this book, and that\u2019s why he changed so radically?After waiting for a moment, Li Xiuchen\u2019s expression indecisive the entire time, he slowly ran out of words to say.He didn\u2019t speak. Luo Jianqing said nothing as well and patiently waited. To his side, however, Xie Zizhuo was impatient. \u201cStop being so indecisive and pick somewhere to go already. That young lady who got third place, I can see that your constitution\u2019s pretty good. Do you want to go with my senior brother to Hao Ming Peak? Our Hao Ming Peak has the most beautiful scenery in Tai Hua Mountain, and fits a cute young lady like you the best\u2026\u201dThe other five disciples who had been waiting the entire time already picked their own school to go to. Li Xiuchen was still standing at the same place he was before, unmoving. When Liu Xiaoxiao was taken by the Qing Lan Peak person, she hesitated for a moment, then said to Li Xiuchen, \u201cChen-gege, Qing Lan Peak is really good. Do you want to come with me to Qing Lan Peak?\u201dLi Xiuchen answered her in a resolute tone, \u201cI want to study under Sir Xuan Lingzi.\u201dLuo Jianqing heard what he said. The smile on his lips deepened, and he didn\u2019t reply.Finally, the other 23 disciples had all picked out the peaks they wanted to go to, leaving only Li Xiuchen who was slow with his decision. He raised his head to look at Luo Jianqing, who lowered his head to look at him. Of the two, one stood in a high position, wearing a white robe, natural and graceful, so handsome it appeared he held the radiance of the whole world; one stood in a low position, wearing clothes made of sackcloth, looked completely ordinary, and his eyes were filled with a shrewd look.After a while, Luo Jianqing said gently, \u201cJunior brother, you should go to Hao Ming Peak. Their techniques suit you better.\u201dLi Xiuchen staunchly shook his head. \u201cNo! Senior brother, I came to Tai Hua Mountain to join Yu Xiao Peak, to study under Sir Xuan Lingzi!\u201dThe phrase \u201cSir Xuan Lingzi\u201d made Luo Jianqing\u2019s smile slowly bend toward his eyes. His palm had already been stained with his own blood from being pinched, but he hadn\u2019t revealed a trace of his true feelings since the very beginning. The corners of his lips were raised as he paid no more attention to Li Xiuchen. Instead, he turned his head to say to the embarrassed Xie Zizhuo, \u201cJunior brother, take him away.\u201dXie Zizhuo originally wanted to say something, but he looked at the clear wisps of blood in Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes and dumbly nodded his head. But when Xie Zizhuo ordered people to take Li Xiuchen, he still shouted noisily, \u201cNo! I want to go to Yu Xiao Peak, I want to go to Yu Xiao Peak! I want to see Sir Xuan Lingzi, I want to see Sir Xuan Lingzi!\u201dThe skies were clear as crystal. The outer disciples of Tai Hua Mountain on the other side of the platform were calm and quiet. The elegant, unworried great senior brother of Tai Hua Mountain stood high with a tranquil expression, watching the junior brother shout as he was being taken away.Who would\u2019ve anticipated this! But he saw the clouds roll in the horizon and a golden sword-light cut the air, quickly penetrating the sky.The majestic sword light brought the whole Tai Hua Mountain to submission. The atmosphere stood still, and water stopped running. The golden sword light that filled the sky made everyone\u2019s swords begin to tremble and shake, like they wanted to pledge their allegiance. The disciples were intimidated, their hearts so unstable they nearly kneeled down.Only a prolonged, deep voice could be heard throughout the boundless distance, like it had come from ancient times. Mixed with a faint sigh, it rang gently from the sky, \u201cJianqing.\u201dThe next day, the 24 newcomers competed one after another on the arena, and every single one did not have any foundation for spiritual power. This sort of competition was very dull, and the great majority of official disciples were bored stiff watching. In fact, by the time it was Li Xiuchen\u2019s turn, many people didn\u2019t even look at him.There was only Luo Jianqing, whose gaze had been concentrated on this ordinary-looking young man this entire time.Throughout the entirety of his past life, Luo Jianqing never understood how a young man with such a mediocre constitution could oppress the stars in the all-peak examinations with average strength, or how he received second place. Even though none of the other disciples had any spiritual power, there were many new disciples among them that had come from clans who studied martial arts techniques since childhood, and their strength far exceeded that of an ordinary person\u2019s.However, Luo Jianqing was actually the only one who had achieved Qi Condensation level in ten days!Among the 36 provinces, the human cultivators were divided into nine levels: namely, Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, Out-of-Body, Body Fusion, Calamity Passage(1), Mahayana, and Immortal Ascension. Every level had their own sub-levels: namely the initial stage, the middle stage, and the last stage, except the Qi Condensation period was divided into nine phases, from Qi Condensation Phase One to Phase Nine.In his past life, there were 23 disciples altogether (apart from the deceased Liu Xiaoxiao), and surprisingly only the worst one, Li Xiuchen, had reached Qi Condensation! And not only was Li Xiuchen born in poverty, but there wasn\u2019t any good environment for children in his family to cultivate. Just like a fantasy story.Nowadays, after reading \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d, Luo Jianqing finally understood why.How could\u2019ve he said that? It was simply because Li Xiuchen was a child of the heavens!See a magic potion when he raises his head, meet a spiritual beast when he lowers it \u2014 this was the truth when it came to him.Li Xiuchen and the rest of the new disciples were temporarily assigned as outer disciples of Tai Hua Mountain to cultivate for ten days. This is what \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d said: Due to his dear childhood friend\u2019s tragic death, Li Xiuchen was determined to become strong, working hard to cultivate every day. However, his innate skill was actually very low, and there was a huge difference between him cultivating for eight days and someone else cultivating for one day. Therefore, the night before the all-peak examinations started, he went to the back of the mountain to entertain himself, and then\u2026 he stepped on a medicine pill!The Spirit-Melting Pill.This was considered to be the most common medicine pill, and what Li Xiuchen also didn\u2019t know was that some medicine master had accidentally left it behind, which was how he found it.The Spirit-Melting Pill was a very average, level one medicine pill. If 10,000 of these were put in front of Luo Jianqing he wouldn\u2019t give them a second glance. But he was no match for the glittering MC halo! This Spirit-Melting Pill wasn\u2019t too bad; actually, it was a god-level Spirit-Melting Pill! After Li Xiuchen took it, his meridians were cleansed and became stronger overnight, and officially stepped into the first level of cultivation!When he got to this point in the book, Luo Jianqing was speechless.A god-level Spirit-Melting Pill, huh!On the entire Tai Hua Mountain, the Qing Lan Peak Lord, the honorable Yu Qingzi was able to refine medicine. But how could a great master who could refine a god-level Spirit-Melting Pill, possibly refine a level one Spirit-Melting Pill? Not only that, but did that old woman have nothing to do than look for outer disciples strolling around at the back of the mountain, and casually drop a god-level medicine pill on the way?Where is the logic?! Where is the reasoning?! This made no sense at all!Therefore, three days ago, Luo Jianqing left Yu Xiao Peak without a word, and headed to the back of the mountain to gather items.Someone, not just Li Xiuchen, would\u2019ve stepped on that god-level medicine pill at some point, but Luo Jianqing had practically overturned the entire mountain to look for it. Finally after an entire night, he found the gold, glittering medicine pill. This pill was truly extraordinary as it said, the will of the heavens was so slanted that you couldn\u2019t see its face!After using his spiritual sense to examine it, he put the god-rank Spirit-Melting Pill inside his storage ring. Luo Jianqing\u2019s thin lips curved up slightly, blossoming into a tranquil and easy smile. His umber-black eyebrows lightly smoothed out, his phoenix eyes curving so they resembled crescent moons. Seeing this, the hearts of many female disciples toppled one after another. However, Luo Jianqing\u2019s gaze had been fixed on what was happening on the arena, not even the slightest bit distracted.And so he said, you don\u2019t have the Spirit-Melting Pill, so how will you defeat your opponent as an ordinary person?Luo Jianqing\u2019s jade-like slender fingers gently rapped against the black iron table. His eyes slightly narrowed, and his smiling expression was profound.In the arena, Li Xiuchen was gloomy, his entire heart restless. He nearly wanted to go back and read \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d again.\u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d was a very well-known stallion novel with a super golden finger. In his past life Li Xiuchen read it no less than ten times. He went over the details in his mind over and over, but nothing particular came up. He clearly remembered that on the ninth day, he had walked around the back of Tai Hua Mountain, then stepped on the god-level Spirit-Melting Pill and raised his cultivation in one go. But yesterday, he spent the entire night walking around the back of Tai Hua Mountain where the outer disciples were. Don\u2019t even mention a god-level medicine pill, he didn\u2019t even see a single spiritual root!Can you really say he isn\u2019t depressed? Can you really say he isn\u2019t sullen?Without the god-level Spirit-Melting Pill, how could he win against these disciples who were raised in clans?His constitution was nothing special at all!\u201cTenth match of the Tai Hua Mountain new disciple all-peak examinations. Xu Hua from Changzhou, fourth-degree constitution: Li Xiuchen from Yuzhou, no constitution.\u201dAfter the voice fell, the senior brothers who were judging them retreated a step back to give the newcomers some space. Seeing the sturdy built Xu Hua across from him, Li Xiuchen\u2019s face twitched: He didn\u2019t have a single thick arm! How is he going to fight him? He was no better than a punching bag!On the high platform, two people were watching this massive gap in strength. Xie Zizhuo chuckled, completely covered in black, and moved close to mutter quietly in Luo Jianqing\u2019s ear, \u201cSenior brother, didn\u2019t I say this earlier? How could you say he might have a chance to win? That Xu Hua\u2019s constitution is fourth-degree, and his cultivation is already a level higher, but Li Xiuchen doesn\u2019t have any constitution at all, and he is short and small. If he wins, wouldn\u2019t the heavens be too biased?\u201dLuo Jianqing turned his head to look at Xie Zizhuo, his fair and elegant eyes softly curving into a smile. He looked at his sloppy-looking junior brother with a smile that wasn\u2019t quite right. \u201cAre you so sure that he\u2019ll lose?\u201dXie Zizhuo said like it was obvious, \u201cOf course. If he does win, tomorrow I\u2019ll go to Siguo Cliff and accompany senior sister Wei!\u201dLuo Jianqing feigned surprise, raising his eyebrows. \u201cYou\u2019re going to take that large a gamble?\u201dXie Zizhuo said mysteriously, \u201cYes, I will. Anyway, senior brother Luo, if you end up being wrong\u2026 I want the jade ox comb you use everyday.\u201dThe corners of Luo Jianqing\u2019s lips pulled into a smile. \u201c\u2026\u201dXie Zizhuo saw his senior brother\u2019s \u201cdon\u2019t be such a pervert\u201d expression. He immediately waved his hand and made himself clear. \u201cIt\u2019s not what I want, it\u2019s what little junior sister wants. Senior brother, did you know that little junior sister has been in love with you since she was young? Otherwise she would never refine. I don\u2019t want this to happen ever, so you can argue with her, but her ultimate wish is to use your jade ox comb.\u201d\u201c\u2026 Why would little junior sister possibly want my jade ox comb?\u201dXie Zizhuo\u2019s eyes widened, and said in disbelief, \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t she? If Yu Xiao Peak wasn\u2019t so strict, our little junior sister would never go up. Do you believe me when I say that she would even climb up in the middle of the night to peep you!\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dXie Zizhuo\u2019s words were still coming like an unending torrent. He was obviously talking about how his own little junior sister was so wretched and perverted, but he didn\u2019t have a single bit of disdain in his words. Instead, it was more accurate to say he sighed with pride. \u201cLittle junior sister is so willful. If I was even half as bold as her, I would\u2019ve visited Cang Shuang Peak everyday.\u201dHearing his words made Luo Jianqing smile wordlessly, but in his heart, a bitter moodiness started to stir.He had been very close with his little junior sister since they were young. Before she became of marriageable age, she declared that she wouldn\u2019t ever marry. But his little junior sister was married to Li Xiuchen until the end, becoming his wife with her hair tied and all(2). He never expected that from his proud and stubborn little junior sister, and her husband still took nine more wives after that. Luo Jianqing heard his little junior sister was very generous in taking care of Li Xiuchen along with other sisters, but he couldn\u2019t imagine anything like that.Under that blue sky and scorching sun, Li Xiuchen held a god-level medicine pill in his hand as he said to him with arrogance, \u201cLuo Jianqing, though you are Qing Lan Peak\u2019s inheriting great disciple, these medicine pills you have been enjoying throughout your life are now with me. Don\u2019t feel any regret.\u201d He was that kind of person. Those red clothes were as bright as fire. Was it possible that he actually enjoyed being superior to Li Xiuchen until the very end?\u2014Because he was a hero that saved beauties! Because the poison of desire ran through his body!How were the heavens ever unfair? The heavens were only fair towards Li Xiuchen!His elegant, pale face was slowly covered in a layer of grief, only to fade away in an instant. Luo Jianqing watched Li Xiuchen with a complex expression. Not knowing why, he said without thinking, \u201cFine, if he loses, I\u2019ll give you my jade ox comb.\u201dXie Zizhuo had been earnestly trying to persuade him, and from time to time he would pull Wei Qiongyin in, saying things like, \u201cAccompanying senior sister Wei is such a scary thought. Senior brother Luo, it\u2019s lucky that you won\u2019t lose anything by giving me your jade ox comb.\u201d Hearing Luo Jianqing suddenly agree made him elated beyond belief, and looked towards the arena with excitement.But in the next second\u2014The tall and strong Xu Hua suddenly covered his stomach. \u201cAh\u2026 it hurts! Judges\u2026 senior brothers, please give me a moment!\u201dJudges, \u201c\u2026\u201dLi Xiuchen, \u201c\u2026\u201dXie Zizhuo was stunned. \u201c\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing was completely silent. \u201c\u2026\u201dEven though he had guessed before that the heavens were biased all the way to the other end of China, he didn\u2019t think they would be this biased!Li Xiuchen\u2019s first match ended as the other person\u2019s stomach hurt too much, winning without a fight!Li Xiuchen\u2019s second match ended just as the other person made a move and suddenly sprained his waist, winning without a fight!Li Xiuchen\u2019s third match was against Liu Xiaoxiao. Just as Liu Xiaoxiao extended her hand to strike Li Xiuchen\u2019s arm, he howled in pain, scaring Liu Xiaoxiao into pulling back her hand and asking timidly, \u201cBig brother Chen, are you okay?\u201d After that, Li Xiuchen moved to subdue her.Everyone watching was completely silent. \u201c\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing sighed. \u201c\u2026\u201dXie Zizhuo was inconsolable and indignant. \u201cThis isn\u2019t fair! This is just luck! Everything\u2019s only been luck!\u201dLuo Jianqing gently shook his head and laughed, \u201cJunior brother, as we immortals say, luck is always power.\u201dXie Zizhuo watched the arena, fuming with anger. He said furiously, \u201cThere\u2019s only three people left. The other two are both children of the eighth largest aristocratic family. I don\u2019t believe it. One has a first-degree constitution, and the other has a second-degree constitution. How could they be worse than a terrible little boy with no constitution?\u201dLi Xiuchen\u2019s fourth opponent happened to be excused, naturally winning without a fight.Xie Zizhuo was silent as tears streamed down his cheeks. \u201c\u2026\u201dBelow, the entire arena was filled with muttering, and many people were pointing at Li Xiuchen. The little girl Liu Xiaoxiao hadn\u2019t stopped rubbing her aching stomach, and wasn\u2019t sitting so close to her big brother Chen anymore. Li Xiuchen\u2019s palm had ruthlessly struck her body. Although she was young and only knew how to depend on her familiar big brother Chen , she wasn\u2019t stupid.That palm of Li Xiuchen really didn\u2019t hurt that much, but she was very upset, her small pretty face completely broken-hearted.What happened wasn\u2019t anything different from his past life. Li Xiuchen got second place yet again in the all-peak examinations, bound to become an inner disciple. After that, Li Xiuchen beamed with happiness, and muttered proudly, \u201cSo this is the protagonist halo, huh? This is really cool! Hehehehe.\u201dLuo Jianqing was watching Li Xiuchen\u2019s immensely proud face with complex feelings in his heart. After watching him for a long time, he slowly started to smile. He raised his head, looking towards the clear blue sky, as if he could see things from the ancient past in the dark blue sky. His delicate, beautiful face held only a gentle smile.He came in second place again this time, but already, there were some things that were different.In his past life, after Li Xiuchen got second place, the disciples on the stage below all exclaimed in admiration. A new junior brother without any constitution was shining on the arena above, becoming the only disciple to achieve Qi Condensation. This encouraging event made people cannot help but admire him. And many people also knew that this junior brother had just lost his childhood friend, so they were sympathetic towards him.But now?\u201cThis guy is really lucky, huh?\u201d\u201cYeah, that guy is pretty vicious. He just struck down that little girl he knew in the arena.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019ll become an inner disciple with second place, but I don\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be so lucky in the future.\u201dLuo Jianqing took in these mutterings without a word, a small smile on his face. Xie Zizhuo stood at his side, so depressed that he had been paralyzed above his chair. He said, dispirited, \u201cThe heavens aren\u2019t fair, the heavens really are too unfair. This kind of luck is something that I, Xie Zizhuo, has never heard of! The heavens aren\u2019t fair!\u201dLuo Jianqing laughed once, and said tranquilly, \u201cJunior brother, the heavens have never been fair.\u201dOriginally, Xie Zizhuo only spoke without thinking, and didn\u2019t expect to receive an answer from Luo Jianqing. He raised his head to look at his senior brother, and saw a despondent look on his face for just an instant. Then Luo Jianqing smiled bitterly, saying, \u201cIf the heavens are not fair, then make them fair. Junior brother, our cultivation is due to ourselves, not the will of the heavens. Do you understand what I just said?\u201dXie Zizhuo was startled for a moment, then respectfully nodded, without any trace of his carelessness from before. \u201cYes.\u201dThe all-peak examinations had ended.The best six of the examinations all became inner disciples, the rest having become outer disciples. And the top three could pick wherever they wanted to go, going from first to third in order. The first place winner came from a powerful family, with a first-degree constitution, and immediately chose the peak of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s sect leader, Cang Shuang Peak. The inheriting disciple from Cang Shuang Peak came and took him away.Next was Li Xiuchen.Luo Jianqing stood on the center of the high platform, his handsome face calm and collected as he said neutrally, \u201cIn the past ten days, there should\u2019ve been an inner disciple that told you the main circumstances of our Tai Hua Mountain. Since you have come in second place in the all-peak examinations, we will let you choose from Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s six peaks. Which one do you wish to go to?\u201dUnlike the first place disciple, no one said a word after Luo Jianqing\u2019s voice fell.All of the senior brothers and sisters of the six peaks that came to receive the new disciples were all mute, staring oddly at Li Xiuchen, who was on the stage. They didn\u2019t really like this weak junior brother, and no one wanted to personally help him get stronger. Could they take this boy by the neck and make him go back? Would his luck be as good as today\u2019s in the future?This situation was entirely different from the one in his past life. At that time, everyone was clamoring for Li Xiuchen, but now no one was showing any interest. Luo Jianqing\u2019s expression didn\u2019t change as he watched Li Xiuchen, showing neither sorrow nor joy. Like a god in the frosty skies, his imposing manner and neutral expression were oppressing.However, exactly the same as his past life, Li Xiuchen humbly cupped his hands in greeting, saying seriously, \u201cSenior brother, I heard that Tai Hua Mountain has seven peaks altogether. Why do you say I\u2019m allowed to pick one out of the six peaks?\u201dOnce his words fell to the ground, everyone was in an uproar.For a while now, Luo Jianqing had felt ice-cold and cutting in his heart, but he said with a tender smile, \u201cThe Yu Xiao Peak where I reside does not accept disciples. I am the only one, so go ahead and choose from the other six peaks.\u201dAfter hearing these words, pleasant surprise flashed through Li Xiuchen\u2019s eyes. Feigning indifference, he continued, \u201cSenior brother, I would like to enter Yu Xiao Peak. Sir Xuan Lingzi is rivaled by none, challenging demonic cultivators with his own strength, a model for us cultivators. I will not hide from you, senior brother, that I greatly admire him. In fact, I came to Tai Hua Mountain just to study under Sir Xuan Lingzi. Even if I became an odd-jobs disciple, I would be most willing.\u201dWhen this happened in his past lifetime, Luo Jianqing was so angry that the spiritual energy in his body rebelled, a flick of his sleeve nearly sending the boy falling to his death.His accomplishments since birth had been excellent, he had extraordinary patience, but his only weakness was that person. Li Xiuchen had hit his sore spot just right, and he couldn\u2019t help but grow furious. He injured Li Xiuchen, then that person, who had never left the gates before, suddenly left Yu Xiao Peak to go back and personally treat Li Xiuchen. Then he told him in a neutral voice, \u201cJianqing, from now on, he will be your junior brother.\u201dIn his past life, he was framed countless times by Li Xiuchen. though there was only one thing that Li Xiuchen said that was right.\u2014He hated Li Xiuchen. He hated that Li Xiuchen had become that person\u2019s disciple, sharing that position reserved only for him.The past floated like clouds in front of his eyes and passed in a flash. Luo Jianqing lowered his head to look at Li Xiuchen. He saw that the latter was looking at him with slight fear, but his eyes also had a trace of expectation, like he was waiting for something. Yet this time, Luo Jianqing merely sighed heavily. Under his sleeves, his fingernails tightly clenched his palm. He said with a gentle smile, \u201cYu Xiao Peak has never accepted any disciples. Junior brother, pick another one.\u201dLi Xiuchen was instantly stupefied.This entire time, he had been waiting for Luo Jianqing to attack, and then Xuan Lingzi would come to help resolve the dispute with Luo Jianqing, while simultaneously bringing him into Yu Xiao Peak. How did Luo Jianqing never raise a hand against him all this time? Perhaps he had passed into this book, and that\u2019s why he changed so radically?After waiting for a moment, Li Xiuchen\u2019s expression indecisive the entire time, he slowly ran out of words to say.He didn\u2019t speak. Luo Jianqing said nothing as well and patiently waited. To his side, however, Xie Zizhuo was impatient. \u201cStop being so indecisive and pick somewhere to go already. That young lady who got third place, I can see that your constitution\u2019s pretty good. Do you want to go with my senior brother to Hao Ming Peak? Our Hao Ming Peak has the most beautiful scenery in Tai Hua Mountain, and fits a cute young lady like you the best\u2026\u201dThe other five disciples who had been waiting the entire time already picked their own school to go to. Li Xiuchen was still standing at the same place he was before, unmoving. When Liu Xiaoxiao was taken by the Qing Lan Peak person, she hesitated for a moment, then said to Li Xiuchen, \u201cChen-gege, Qing Lan Peak is really good. Do you want to come with me to Qing Lan Peak?\u201dLi Xiuchen answered her in a resolute tone, \u201cI want to study under Sir Xuan Lingzi.\u201dLuo Jianqing heard what he said. The smile on his lips deepened, and he didn\u2019t reply.Finally, the other 23 disciples had all picked out the peaks they wanted to go to, leaving only Li Xiuchen who was slow with his decision. He raised his head to look at Luo Jianqing, who lowered his head to look at him. Of the two, one stood in a high position, wearing a white robe, natural and graceful, so handsome it appeared he held the radiance of the whole world; one stood in a low position, wearing clothes made of sackcloth, looked completely ordinary, and his eyes were filled with a shrewd look.After a while, Luo Jianqing said gently, \u201cJunior brother, you should go to Hao Ming Peak. Their techniques suit you better.\u201dLi Xiuchen staunchly shook his head. \u201cNo! Senior brother, I came to Tai Hua Mountain to join Yu Xiao Peak, to study under Sir Xuan Lingzi!\u201dThe phrase \u201cSir Xuan Lingzi\u201d made Luo Jianqing\u2019s smile slowly bend toward his eyes. His palm had already been stained with his own blood from being pinched, but he hadn\u2019t revealed a trace of his true feelings since the very beginning. The corners of his lips were raised as he paid no more attention to Li Xiuchen. Instead, he turned his head to say to the embarrassed Xie Zizhuo, \u201cJunior brother, take him away.\u201dXie Zizhuo originally wanted to say something, but he looked at the clear wisps of blood in Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes and dumbly nodded his head. But when Xie Zizhuo ordered people to take Li Xiuchen, he still shouted noisily, \u201cNo! I want to go to Yu Xiao Peak, I want to go to Yu Xiao Peak! I want to see Sir Xuan Lingzi, I want to see Sir Xuan Lingzi!\u201dThe skies were clear as crystal. The outer disciples of Tai Hua Mountain on the other side of the platform were calm and quiet. The elegant, unworried great senior brother of Tai Hua Mountain stood high with a tranquil expression, watching the junior brother shout as he was being taken away.Who would\u2019ve anticipated this! But he saw the clouds roll in the horizon and a golden sword-light cut the air, quickly penetrating the sky.The majestic sword light brought the whole Tai Hua Mountain to submission. The atmosphere stood still, and water stopped running. The golden sword light that filled the sky made everyone\u2019s swords begin to tremble and shake, like they wanted to pledge their allegiance. The disciples were intimidated, their hearts so unstable they nearly kneeled down.Only a prolonged, deep voice could be heard throughout the boundless distance, like it had come from ancient times. Mixed with a faint sigh, it rang gently from the sky, \u201cJianqing.\u201d(1) Body Fusion (\u5408\u4f53), Calamity Passage(\u6e21\u52ab). I couldn\u2019t find any English translation for these so I tried my best. If there is, tell me.(2) \u7ed3\u53d1: binding your hair upon coming of agePrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 4": "Chapter 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis limitless spiritual energy filled the entire sky, so powerful that it seemed to coagulate into a sea, so oppressing that every disciple there couldn\u2019t lift their heads. Only Luo Jianqing who was standing in the middle of the tall platform faintly raised his head, like he had long gotten used to this fearsome, oppressing aura. He raised his gaze, fixed on somewhere far away.No one had arrived yet. Only the voice had reached them first.After that vast, majestic golden sword-light passed, they were finally able to see a white-clothed figure.Long black hair was tied up in the simplest white jade crown, clothed in a white embroidered gown sewn with complicated, densely veined patterns, rich clothes with wide sleeves, contrasting against the blue sky above. He was so dazzling that people couldn\u2019t help but look at him with reverence blooming in their hearts. He stood at the summit above all living things, watching the crowd below him with an apathetic and tranquil gaze. Finally, his line of sight slowly stopped at the top of the tall platform.Luo Jianqing\u2019s head was lifted, several hundred meters away, one in the sky, one on the ground, staring at that person.Like he hadn\u2019t seen him in a hundred thousand years, Luo Jianqing gazed at him soundlessly, the other person calmly returning his gaze. After a moment, the bloodstains in his palm were so hot it felt like it was going to combust. Luo Jianqing raised his hand in a show of respect, solemnly saying, \u201cMaster.\u201dXuan Lingzi stood in the clouds, answering lightly, \u201cMn.\u201dTai Hua Mountain\u2019s Yu Xiao Peak Lord was Sir Xuan Lingzi, the current number one immortal in the cultivation world. At fifteen, he achieved Foundation Establishment. At 25, he reached the Core Formation stage. At 56, he succeeded in creating a Nascent Soul. At present, he had cultivated for no more than 300 years, but was the only cultivator under the heavens who refined his qi into spirit. Looking over the past 5,000 years, he was also the only cultivator who had hopes to levitate heavenwards and become immortal.Countless disciples widened their eyes in amazement when they saw Xuan Lingzi. Even the newly accepted disciples did not dare look towards that person in disbelief. They only stared for a moment, then timidly moving away their line of sight.This was the superiority of a honored senior who had achieved spirit-refining. They had merely looked at him for an instant, but quickly became panic-stricken.And among the crowd of disciples, no one was more excited than Li Xiuchen. With wild joy, he looked at the noble honored senior who was dressed in a white chang pao. Although he couldn\u2019t look at him for too long, he was so excited that he couldn\u2019t control himself: Xuan Lingzi came! Xuan Lingzi\u2019s going to take me as his disciple!Xuan Lingzi\u2019s cold, elegant face had no trace of emotion, like he totally had no concern for the disciples all around him. His line of sight was fixed on his own disciple, the golden sword mark in the middle of his forehead glowing faintly with golden light. He had thin eyes and long eyebrows, a nose like it had been cut with a knife, lips devoid of color. He truly seemed like a simple and elegant immortal with no worldly concerns, making anyone respect him.Xuan Lingzi attentively gazed at the disciple on the high platform. Luo Jianqing lowered his head, keeping silent.After a moment, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s pupils shrunk, and suddenly shifted to the high platform.Once he appeared, Xie Zizhuo next to Luo Jianqing became intimidated. Xie Zizhuo hurriedly shouted several sentences, \u201cMartial uncle Xuan Lingzi.\u201d Xuan Lingzi lightly nodded towards him, and Xie Zizhuo hastily descended the high platform, not daring to stand next to this gifted martial uncle.\u201cYou really won\u2019t lift your head?\u201d Xuan Lingzi asked apathetically.Luo Jianqing kept his respectful position as before, not answering.His handsome eyebrows knit together, Xuan Lingzi looked down towards his rebellious disciple, and asked again in a low voice, \u201cYour master has just come out of seclusion and heard you are currently arranging the all-peak examinations for the new disciples. Your flying sword has finished refining, would you like to look?\u201dLuo Jianqing still kept his head lowered with no reaction.This situation made Xuan Lingzi knit his eyebrows together tightly, as if he didn\u2019t understand what was the matter with his usually considerate disciple. His cold lips pursed, about to ask a question, then suddenly heard a pleasantly surprised shout off stage. \u201cSir! I am Li Xiuchen, I have admired you for many years, and wish to enter your school.\u201dXuan Lingzi seemed as if he didn\u2019t hear him and put his hands together behind him, continuing to look down at his disciple.After a long time, the powerful and oppressive ocean-like aura scattered heavily, making the disciples near the tall platform feel so threatened their faces turned white. Even Li Xiuchen who had shouted earlier was sweating like a pig from fright. And the white-clothed great senior brother who was in the heart of the oppressive aura felt so constricted he could not straighten his back, but he still grit his teeth and didn\u2019t make a sound.Xuan Lingzi sighed heavily and drew back his oppressive aura. \u201cGo back to Yu Xiao Peak.\u201dLuo Jianqing suddenly raised his head in surprise. He looked at the other person and asked, astonished, \u201cMaster?\u201dThis time, Xuan Lingzi discovered that at some point, his normally respectful disciple\u2019s eyes had turned completely red. His fair and beautiful face was covered in dense sweat, and his scattered hair was damp with sweat and stuck to his face. He was out of spiritual breath, but this frightened state was more beautiful.Having no reaction to this, Xuan Lingzi neutrally nodded. \u201cGo back. I\u2019ll let you see your new flying sword.\u201dLuo Jianqing was overjoyed at the unexpected good news, and immediately answered, \u201cYes!\u201dAs he spoke, Luo Jianqing gave the follow-up matters of the all-peak examinations to the disciple next to him, then prepared to return with his master. No one expected that at that moment, Li Xiuchen ran to the side of the high platform and raised his head, saying loudly, \u201cSir Xuan Lingzi, this disciple wishes to enter Yu Xiao Peak, to become your disciple!\u201dEveryone was strangely quiet when these words fell.Luo Jianqing\u2019s smile disappeared in a flash. He clenched his fingers tightly, his fingernails digging into the recent bloodstains again. The bloodstains had already formed a scab, but blood started seeping out again when it was punctured. The pain made Luo Jianqing narrow his eyes, looking at Li Xiuchen off-stage.Li Xiuchen had an earnest and serious expression, but he was secretly very excited.After he became Xuan Lingzi\u2019s disciple and entered Yu Xiao Peak, he would receive careful guidance from the cultivation world\u2019s most powerful person. At 20 years old, he could achieve Qi Foundation, and Core Formation at 40. He may not be as good as Xuan Lingzi, but it was good to be well prepared! His inherent weakness was no problem, he had a golden finger. The first step is to find a good master, then he would get further and further!This was all well and fine, but although this Luo Jianqing was a little strange, Xuan Lingzi still arrived in the end. He could enter Yu Xiao Peak as he had before.Through his joy, Li Xiuchen was not paying attention to what was happening on the high platform.Only being able to see Xuan Lingzi\u2019s cold white robe and the dazzling golden sword marking on his forehead, he lowered his head to glance at Li Xiuchen, then turned his head to continue looking at his disciple. With a cold expression, he asked serenely, \u201cJianqing, has Yu Xiao Peak started accepting disciples?\u201dSuddenly hearing these words, Luo Jianqing stumbled, the monstrous hatred in his heart instantly fading away. He looked at him in surprise, his logic and reason also vanishing in the moment.Under the shining sunlight, Xuan Lingzi looked at him with his usual indifference. He buried that sentence he said into the bottom of his heart. In his two lifetimes, he had never destroyed his hurt and bitterness, and suddenly felt like it had lightened somewhat.Luo Jianqing faintly opened his mouth. When he spoke, he found that his voice was already hoarse.\u201c\u2026No, Master.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThis happened very quickly. Li Xiuchen looked at the pair of master and disciple with astonishment, and couldn\u2019t collect his thoughts for a long time. By the time he reacted, in the wake of the golden light fading away above the mountains, the two had left behind the waiting Li Xiuchen standing in the audience, along with his watching senior and junior brothers.\u201cYu Xiao Peak has traditionally never accepted disciples for years. How come this new junior brother doesn\u2019t realize that?\u201d\u201cI heard in those days, martial uncle Xuan Lingzi was the only disciple of Yu Xiao Peak, and now Yu Xiao Peak has a great senior brother. Does he still think he can enter?\u201d\u201cYu Xiao Peak\u2019s standards for apprenticeship are so high. This guy totally doesn\u2019t meet the qualifications. Martial uncle Xuan Lingzi has a super level constitution, and so does senior brother Luo. This person doesn\u2019t seem to have any constitution at all. How could martial uncle Xuan Lingzi even look at him?\u201dLi Xiuchen\u2019s eyes were wide open, looking towards where the two people had disappeared in confusion. Once he was taken to Hao Ming Peak, in the room he was assigned he muttered, as if he lost his soul, \u201cNo no no\u2026 how could this happen? How could this happen? Where did I go wrong in the end? Where did\u2026 yi? Luo Jianqing?!\u201dThinking of this, Li Xiuchen seemed like he was struck by lightning. After a moment, he cursed loudly, \u201cThat\u2019s right! That little girl should\u2019ve gotten hit by lightning, so why did Luo Jianqing suddenly show up! And today, why didn\u2019t Luo Jianqing hit me! Luo Jianqing Luo Jianqing\u2026 is it possible he transmigrated as well? Fucking Luo Jianqing, who the hell are you!!!\u201dLuo Jianqing didn\u2019t hear Li Xiuchen\u2019s curses, as he had been following Xuan Lingzi the entire time back to Yu Xiao Peak. It wasn\u2019t long before he could see the two simple and modest bamboo houses. The bamboo houses were surrounded by a dense forest of bamboo. Green bamboo swayed gently in the breeze, causing them to gurgle.After they returned to the bamboo houses, Xuan Lingzi took out a sword from his storage ring.\u201cThis sword is three feet and seven inches long and 312 pounds. Use this ten-thousand year black iron that you have brought back previously, a thousand-year Lightning Crystal, a low-level fourth-degree Lightning Pellet and refine them together. This sword is quick, and can pull ten thousand miles of lightning and thunder to join you in resisting the enemy. It is considered to be a earth-level magic weapon.\u201d As he spoke, Xuan Lingzi grasped the sword with one hand, handing it to his disciple. \u201cJianqing, from now on, this will be your life-bound magic weapon, so it must have a name.\u201dThe cyan tip of the sword faintly twinkled, and the sharp and fierce edge seemed like it could cut the skies, but it had been temporarily sealed by Xuan Lingzi\u2019s spiritual power. The sword lightly shivered, as if it didn\u2019t agree to surrender in this tiny bamboo house. Xuan Lingzi had been holding the sword the entire time, waiting for his disciple to take it.However, Luo Jianqing had been staring attentively at the sword the entire time, and was slow with reacting.In his past lifetime, he named this sword Zhui Yin.His master had asked him in astonishment why he chose this name. His reply was, \u201cThis sword is quick, and chases at the speed of sound, so I named it Zhui Yin.\u201d(1)At the time, his master lightly nodded and didn\u2019t ask any further. But he was the only one who truly knew what this sword\u2019s name meant.The immortal name of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Yu Xiao Peak Lord was Xuan Lingzi, originally named Wu Yin. (2)Chasing and chasing sound, chasing at the speed of sound, or perhaps no sound?Looking at this sword, Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart gradually began to ache. After a moment, he took the sword. The originally howling sword suddenly became obedient in Luo Jianqing\u2019s hands, flowing with blue light and letting out a low cry.Xuan Lingzi looked at this scene, satisfied. He understood this sword had already recognized its master. But before he could think anything else, he heard his disciple say quietly, \u201cMaster, its name will be Shuang Fu.\u201d (3)Xuan Lingzi\u2019s entire body trembled, and raised his head to look at Luo Jianqing. After a while, he finally asked, \u201c\u2026 For what reason?\u201dLuo Jianqing laughed, and said, \u201cThunder frightens electricity into scattering. Snow splashes, becoming floating frost. And since this sword can pull ten thousand miles of lightning, I name it Shuang Fu.\u201d Luo Jianqing\u2019s voice had just fell when the sword trembled slightly, like it was agreeing with him.Luo Jianqing looked at his sword with a smile, then decided to turn and go into the bamboo forest to try it out. However, just when he turned, he heard Xuan Lingzi\u2019s cold and elegant voice say behind him, \u201cJianqing, you\u2026yi, what happened to your hand?\u201dThe next moment, an ice-cold hand suddenly gripped Luo Jianqing\u2019s wrist, pulling him back.Luo Jianqing\u2026 I don\u2019t know, but that seems kinda gay\u2026I can\u2019t be the only one who got serious second-hand embarrassment from LXC\u2019s desperate cries for attention, right?(1) Zhui Yin (\u8ffd\u97f3): to chase sound(2) Wu Yin (\u65e0\u97f3): without sound(3) Shuang Fu (\u971c\u6d6e): floating frostPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 5": "Chapter 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe jade-green bamboo swayed freely, the slender leaves dancing back and forth.Yu Xiao Peak was at the very heart of Tai Hua Mountain, surrounded by the other six peaks, and held the position of having the very best earth-type spiritual veins. Yu Xiao Peak had 81 first-class restrictions, 36 second-class restrictions, which just so happened to correspond with China\u2019s 36 provinces; and lastly there were nine third-class restrictions, symbolizing that nine divided by nine is one. (1)There were so many that all of the previous great elders even joined together to set up and seal an enormous army at the summit, which could trap any cultivator that was at the Mahayana stage or lower.If Tai Hua Mountain was every cultivator\u2019s holy land, then Yu Xiao Peak was the foundation of Tai Hua Mountain.For the past thirteen consecutive generations, Yu Xiao Peak has only ever accepted one disciple. One reason was that Yu Xiao Peak\u2019s requirements for accepting disciples were very high and they must have a superior level constitution; the other reason was that training one disciple needed a great deal of effort and care. If they were merely an ordinary disciple, then there would be no problem, but Yu Xiao Peak\u2019s disciples were nurtured with the goal of making them great elders of their sect.Xuan Lingzi had cultivated for no more than 316 years, and today he was the sole cultivator in the entire world who had achieved Spirit-Refining. Luo Jianqing was 17 years old when he achieved Qi Foundation, Core Formation at 32, and he was also already a giant among men of this generation. He had confidence that he would definitely break through Spirit-Refining one day.And currently, Xuan Lingzi was looking downwards at the bloodstains in his disciple\u2019s palm, not saying anything.Cultivators that achieved Core Formation already had bodies as tough as steel, and it was nearly impossible to injure them.This series of crescent-shaped scars were clearly recent and were left behind by the owner\u2019s own nails. How strong was his determination, even if he had absolutely no fingernails, if it made him able to draw blood from his hard skin?Xuan Lingzi still hadn\u2019t made any inquiries, only brushing away his sleeve to take out a small white jade bottle from his storage ring. He drew out a drop of Concentrated Jade Syrup and gently smeared it on the wounds. His smooth, round fingertips softly stroked the tender skin of his palm. Luo Jianqing\u2019s entire body trembled a little, the numbness passing along to his palm.Even when Xuan Lingzi was applying the magic medicine, he was as calm and undisturbed as usual, completely unwavering.His narrow eyes lowered slightly, the white robe that covered his entire body aloof and eminent. The golden sword marking on his forehead made him seem elegant, dignified and honorable, making no one dare to approach him. After he was done cautiously applying medicine on Luo Jianqing\u2019s left palm, he smoothly took the other hand.But Luo Jianqing suddenly withdrew his hand and said hoarsely, \u201cMaster, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s movements suddenly become sluggish. After a moment, he lightly nodded his head and handed over the Concentrated Jade Syrup to him.Luo Jianqing took a bit of light green ointment and smeared it over his right palm.\u2014He used his right hand to hold his sword, and as a sword cultivator, this was his most important hand. His left hand was already so sensitive; provided that if he really let this person help him apply ointment on his right hand, he didn\u2019t know what kind of things he would\u2019ve done.After a short time, Luo Jianqing was done with the ointment.The light green ointment immediately dissolved, and Luo Jianqing felt that his wounds were a little numb. When he raised his hands and looked at them, the small wounds had already healed, leaving behind only a row of pink scars.Xuan Lingzi said lowly, \u201cTake this bottle of Concentrated Jade Syrup with you, and do not harm yourself again.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded in response.Less than a moment later, the two went to an open space outside the bamboo house, preparing to try out the sword.Luo Jianqing\u2019s right hand held his sword, his line of sight concentrated into a thin line. He stared solemnly in front of him, like he was facing a single enemy. In his hand, Shuang Fu answered his greeting and sent out bursts of green haze in eagerness, like it was impatient.In the next second, his sword rushed forth, emitting a brilliant sword-light.His long sword danced, his sleeves flying energetically as the green sword-light fluttered all around the viridian bamboo like a swimming dragon, stirring up sand and dust. The oppressive aura of his sword swept the entire forest like a mighty river, but he handled it so flawlessly that he didn\u2019t hurt the bamboo itself, only making them wobble violently.This sword was an earth-type life-bound magic weapon, and the person dancing with the sword was the top master of a young generation.His black hair moved without wind, the beauty of his refined and exceptional appearance could be faintly seen in the middle of the sword movements, his manner relaxed, and his sword-energy was also oppressive. If his little junior sister could see this, perhaps stirrings of love would emerge. But the one watching off to the side was Xuan Lingzi, only watching from above with indifference and without any judgment.After he was finished trying out his sword for the first time, Luo Jianqing clung to Shuang Fu as he headed back to the bamboo house.\u201cMaster, this sword is connected to my heart.\u201dXuan Lingzi nodded indifferently. \u201cMn, practice hard.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s hair was already soaked with sweat, his bright eyes rippling with the color of water, with his lips dark red and cheeks pink. His already beautiful immortal-like face became even more astonishingly alluring, like the most splendid, flickering haze around scenic lakes and mountains. His loveliness was so great that it had already transcended the boundaries of gender.But Xuan Lingzi had no reaction to any of this. After talking about some trivial things again, he started to walk.Luo Jianqing was slightly startled, and impulsively yelled, \u201cMaster!\u201dXuan Lingzi turned to look at him. \u201cWhat is it?\u201dLuo Jianqing pursed his lips for a long time, saying, \u201cMaster, why were you in seclusion for so long this time?\u201dAs if he couldn\u2019t come up with an answer, quite a while had passed before Xuan Lingzi finally said, \u201c \u201cThe shortest I have been in seclusion was half a month. The longest was three years.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s expression turned dark.This was entirely different from his past life.In his past life, after Xuan Lingzi had accepted Li Xiuchen, he never went into seclusion again. Throughout the entire 18 years, he spent a generous amount of time teaching Li Xiuchen with great attention, so much that this boy with no constitution achieved Qi Foundation at 20 years old and possessed an extraordinary ability to resist.Luo Jianqing was already quite well along in his past life, having been in the late stage of Core Formation and only a step away from entering the Nascent Soul stage. But at that time, Li Xiuchen was no more than 34 years old and he was only in the late stage of Qi Foundation. To his surprise, he led a group of decent and righteous people and broke a great boundary, stabbing that sword into his heart.When Li Xiuchen was present, this person never went into seclusion, preferring to let his cultivation stagnate at the early stage of Spirit-Refining for 18 years. And now that Li Xiuchen wasn\u2019t here, he immediately continued seclusion and only spoke a few trivial words to him, then had nothing else to say.Slowly, this bitter feeling became agony, until it finally transformed into a raging blaze, consuming Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart.His handsome and unworried face no longer had any trace of the joy he had before. Luo Jianqing cupped his hands in salute, and said expressionlessly, \u201cMaster, this disciple hopes that your great masters will order to drive out that new disciple who should have never entered Tai Hua Mountain.\u201dFor a very long time, Luo Jianqing waited for Xuan Lingzi\u2019s answer with his head lowered. Finally he heard the other person say flatly, \u201cWhat for?\u201dLuo Jianqing said again, \u201cYou do not need to ask who it is?\u201dXuan Lingzi said, \u201cThat boy who wanted to enter Yu Xiao Peak, isn\u2019t it?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s entire body tensed.His master never remembered people. Of the seven finest disciples of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s seven peaks, his master didn\u2019t remember any of them. But surprisingly, he had remembered Li Xiuchen.Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyebrows furrowed as he looked down, his voice colder than a forest. \u201cYes, that\u2019s him. Master, at Leiting Road, Jianqing personally witnessed him take the effort to retreat back a step, hiding behind that \u25a1\u25a1 year old little girl who was accompanying him. He even pulled the corner of the girl\u2019s robe just to block the lightning for him. Such a cruel and merciless disciple absolutely must not enter our Tai Hua Mountain. Master, please see clearly.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s fingers were clenched tight, stubbornly waiting for his answer.After a while, he heard Xuan Lingzi say in a level tone, \u201cSince he has already entered Hao Ming Peak, naturally senior brother Guangling should inspect this matter instead. You should discuss this with senior brother Guangling and ask him to investigate this thoroughly. If what you say is true, no mercy should be shown.\u201dLuo Jianqing gritted his teeth, the blaze in his heart already burning again.\u201cJianqing, you must not get involved in this matter by any means. Bear in mind that you should concentrate only on cultivation. Do not get too involved with that disciple again.\u201dHis voice fell, and the door to the bamboo house shut.Luo Jianqing stood outside the bamboo house by himself, still cupping his hands in salute. After a very long time, he slowly straightened up and stared at the bamboo house with a painful and complex gaze, like he could see the person inside.That\u2019s right, he\u2019d forgotten. At that time, that person\u2019s life-bound sword had ruthlessly pierced through his stomach. That sword was so cold, as cold as the person who owned it. In the end, the master and disciple who had been together for dozens of years couldn\u2019t compare with Li Xiuchen, who he had known for eighteen years. If he didn\u2019t have the heaven-level Xuan Ling sword, Li Xiuchen\u2019s fortune with the heavens wouldn\u2019t matter, as he couldn\u2019t cross levels and behead him.Unfortunately, it did turn out to be Xuan Ling!Mind boiling in impure qi, Luo Jianqing\u2019s pupils shrunk, and hurriedly rushed into his own bamboo house. Once he entered, he vomited a mouthful of blood from his heart. The resentful sorrow that had been reverberating ever since he reincarnated, dissipated and was replaced by an overflowing rage.\u201cAren\u2019t you my master, and aren\u2019t I your disciple?\u201d\u201cI followed your teachings so closely throughout my entire past life, I never crossed your limits by even half a step until the very end, and what do I get back?\u201d\u201cWu Yin\u2026 Wu Yin.\u201d\u201cWu Yin!\u201dAfter taking care of the blood in his heart that boiled from his anger, Luo Jianqing meditated in the bamboo house for the next three days. On the afternoon of the third day, Luo Jianqing heard a clamoring coming down from Yu Xiao Peak far, far away. He immediately grasped his sword and went down the mountain, then saw the erratic Xie Zizhuo.Luo Jianqing\u2019s lips pulled up and turned around to leave.Xie Zizhuo hurriedly caught up to him without saying anything further. Suddenly, he laid down on the ground and hugged Luo Jianqing\u2019s thigh. \u201cSenior brother!!!\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter a moment, Luo Jianqing flung the animal off his thigh. However, he didn\u2019t expect for this animal to cling to him so tightly like a piece of dog-skin plaster, and couldn\u2019t get him off.Luo Jianqing said in astonishment, \u201cJunior brother, you\u2019re a golden core cultivator as well, can\u2019t you have some face?\u201dXie Zizhuo shook his head, not caring in the slightest. \u201cNope! Senior brother, if you don\u2019t answer me I won\u2019t get up!\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dAfter Luo Jianqing went up Yu Xiao Peak, dragging Xie Zizhuo along the entire journey, he carried some bamboo-green tea from the top of Yu Xiao Peak, which Xie Zizhuo gulped an entire cup of. He immediately took the teapot and poured it in his mouth, just like a cow chewing a tree. Luo Jianqing, who was not in a good mood, tilted his head to look at this person. Xie Zizhuo didn\u2019t seem to notice. After he was done drinking, he laid on his stomach again and clung to Luo Jianqing\u2019s thigh.\u201cSenior brother save me!!!\u201dLuo Jianqing wordlessly gave Xie Zizhuo a boiled chestnut and listened to his explanation.Originally, the reason why Xie Zizhuo wanted to find little junior sister to refine pills for him was not for him, but was for\u2026 fifth junior brother\u2019s spiritual beast. That day, Xie Zizhuo went to Yu Shou Peak to find fifth junior brother and couldn\u2019t find him. Then he went to find fifth junior brother\u2019s recently tamed sixth-level spiritual beast.Xie Zizhuo took a big gulp of tea, then said, \u201cSenior brother, a sixth-level spiritual beast! That\u2019s on the same level as a Nascent Soul cultivator, and it was tamed too!\u201dLuo Jianqing raised an eyebrow. \u201cSo what happened with it?\u201dXie Zizhuo chuckled mischievously. \u201cI just did a little something to it.\u201dLuo Jianqing didn\u2019t believe him as Xie Zizhuo was in the early stage of Core Formation, and what threat could he pose to a sixth-level spiritual beast? But the affairs of the world were hard to guess. Xie Zizhuo didn\u2019t know that this spiritual beast had an internal injury, and the reason why fifth junior brother left was to give this spiritual beast a medicine pellet. In front of Xie Zizhuo\u2019s shameless provocations, the spiritual beast was knowledgeable and was certain he would not hold back. Thus, Xie Zizhuo attacked it despite its internal injuries and caused it serious injury.Xie Zizhuo originally had thought, \u201cHave I really gotten that strong?\u201d then heard that fifth junior brother was hurrying to humiliate him.Fifth junior brother had already made every Yu Shou Peak disciple beat Xie Zizhuo whenever they saw him, and if they couldn\u2019t, they would call him to come beat him up! Therefore, on the days that Luo Jianqing wasn\u2019t present, everyone was calling each other to beat up Xie Zizhuo. It was so awful that it had gotten to the point where he would frequently seclude himself.Xie Zizhuo knew that he was guilty, and wanted to find little junior sister to refine a medicine pill to bring the spiritual beast back to death. However, little junior sister didn\u2019t care, and that was why he went to find Luo Jianqing today.Xie Zizhuo sobbed as tears and mucus flowed down his face. \u201cSenior brother, next year is the great sect competition. If I don\u2019t resolve this spiritual beast business, fifth junior brother will beat me to death! His cultivation isn\u2019t as good as mine, but his spiritual beasts are so scary, you have to rescue me!\u201dAs he spoke, Xie Zizhuo was holding onto his thigh the entire time, beginning to explain in detail the past ten years or so. First he talked the time during his childhood when he accompanied Luo Jianqing kneeling in punishment, then talked about the camaraderie of the time the two of them peeked at third senior sister showering\u2026Listening to him talk made the blue veins on Luo Jianqing\u2019s forehead jump. \u201cStop talking nonsense! In those days, you dragged me off to wherever you went, and I didn\u2019t know that was third junior sister\u2026 cough, and you weren\u2019t accompanying me, I was accompanying you! Master\u2026\u201d His voice stopped suddenly.Xie Zizhuo didn\u2019t notice Luo Jianqing\u2019s strange behavior and picked up his words. \u201cYes yes yes, I know that martial uncle Xuan Lingzi was always strict with you, but it\u2019s not your fault that you wanted to kneel together with me. Senior brother, help me this time, I don\u2019t want your jade ox comb anymore, you only\u2026yi?\u201dA short, light brown jade comb suddenly appeared in front of Xie Zizhuo.Xie Zizhuo scrambled for the jade ox comb and raised his head, smiling bashfully. He wanted to give Luo Jianqing thanks, but saw the \u201cTai Hua\u2019s Flower\u201d great senior brother smile tranquilly. A small star flashed through his clear and elegant eyes, enough to draw anyone in.\u201cGo \u2026 give it to little junior sister, and tell her that I like someone else, so she won\u2019t wait anymore.\u201dHe said these words softly and quietly, making Xie Zizhuo gradually become sentimental. By the time Luo Jianqing got up to see him out, Xie Zizhuo suddenly snapped out of it. He looked at his senior brother with a complex and profound look, and finally couldn\u2019t help saying, \u201cSenior brother, you have been friends with her for thirty-three years. Little junior sister could never forget you. If you use that kind of excuse, there\u2019s no way she\u2019ll believe it.\u201dLuo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help but give a low laugh, looking at Xie Zizhuo for a moment too long.It was just like in his past life. They thought that \u201cI like someone else\u201d was just an excuse, but no one knew that he was telling the truth.Xie Zizhuo\u2019s words reminded Luo Jianqing to ask, his eyebrows furrowed, \u201cI remember that the new disciples\u2019 first practice is in two months. Are they led by little junior sister?\u201dXie Zizhuo nodded seriously. \u201cYes, senior brother. They are being led by little junior sister.\u201dThis matter had already happened a very long time ago, but once he was reminded, Luo Jianqing remembered something.Xie Zizhuo said that little junior sister could never forget him, but little junior sister still married Li Xiuchen in the end, becoming his number one wife. That was because during their first practice, little junior sister and Li Xiuchen fell into the great vestiges of someone\u2019s Nascent Soul together. In the end, he was consumed by the poison of desire, and had no choice but for that kind of relationship to break out between her and Li Xiuchen.Xie Zizhuo could guess what happened considering Li Xiuchen\u2019s nature and how he treated his little junior sister. That boy, merely third-stage Qi Foundation, was violating the early-stage Core Formation little junior sister, whose mind was not clear. He remembered that in his past life, after his little junior sister came back, she came to Yu Xiao Peak to look for him before completely secluding herself for five years.His little junior sister waited at the bottom of the peak for an entire ten days. Because he wanted to break her heart, he cruelly never went to see her.At that time, little junior sister had just ***, and the person who came up Yu Xiao Peak and humiliated her was none other than Li Xiuchen, but she still stubbornly waited at the place where her enemy came to find her. Thinking about this, Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart hurt unbearably.He would never give that crook a chance to do that to his little junior sister ever again!Even though little junior sister would be rescued by Li Xiuchen time and time again, finally left with no choice but resolve to give herself in marriage, he would not allow Li Xiuchen to rape his junior sister under those circumstances. \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d didn\u2019t miss any details, so much that even those private affairs were written out in full.\u201cThis senior sister had been long feverish from head to foot, but through life or death, she would not budge. Finally, Li Xiuchen could not bear it and pulled her hand. A tear streamed from the corner of senior sister\u2019s eye, and after a long time, she finally took Li Xiuchen\u2019s hand. The haughtiness she displayed just before dissipated thoroughly under the poison of desire. Li Xiuchen turned over the arrogant and willful senior sister and pushed her down, tearing apart her clothes.\u201dWhat was written afterwards was too embarrassing to mention.His eyes already completely red, Luo Jianqing had been preparing for this moment, and steadied his mental state as much as he could. He turned his head to say to Xie Zizhuo, \u201cI can ask sect leader martial uncle to let me lead practice in two months. Let little junior sister relax and take her time refining pills for you.\u201dXie Zizhuo stared blankly. \u201cSenior brother, guiding newcomers during practice is an unimportant matter that you don\u2019t have an obligation to.\u201dLuo Jianqing shook his head firmly. \u201cI\u2019ll go this time.\u201dXie Zizhuo shook his head in a way like it was filled with fog. When Xie Zizhuo was about to leave, Luo Jianqing looked at him and said calmly, \u201cHow is that Li Xiuchen doing at Hao Ming Peak?\u201dWhen he mentioned the name, Xie Zizhuo\u2019s expression darkened. \u201cHow? His constitution is so awful that he still hasn\u2019t entered Qi Condensation.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded his head in understanding. Quietly, he said as a last word, \u201cJunior brother, I don\u2019t like him.\u201dXie Zizhuo suddenly stared, then chuckled. \u201cI know, senior brother. You can relax.\u201dVery quickly, Xie Zizhuo turned into a ribbon of silver light disappearing into the horizon. The business about \u201cdriving Li Xiuchen out of our sect\u201d, Luo Jianqing hadn\u2019t mentioned to Xie Zizhuo at all, because he knew that not a single person would believe him based off empty words. Also, Liu Xiaoxiao herself didn\u2019t know something like that had happened, and even in fear she will stand up for her big brother Chen.Luo Jianqing could not act so recklessly.Looking at the verdant, lush grass at the base of Yu Xiao Peak, Luo Jianqing knit his eyebrows slightly, and finally let out a long sigh.In two months, he would lead the new disciples through practice. During this period of time, he must concentrate fully on cultivation, or at the very least deal with his incessantly scattering spiritual energy appropriately. The boundaries\u2026 must, never, be, crossed, again!(1) Nine by nine is one: An abacus rule. Also means that things are inevitable.jianqing jianqing, yes master? eating vinegar, no master, open your mouth, hahahaPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe worked his cultivation methods, absorbed universal qi, and completed a microcosmic orbit (1) along the direction of the veins, muscles, and bones in his body, then completed a macrocosmic orbit. He repeated this 81 times, a common routine for cultivators.The day Luo Jianqing reincarnated, on the way back to Tai Hua Mountain, he discovered that he was unable to inhale the universal qi as he once habitually did. If the universal qi was compared to an innocent yet powerful child, it would\u2019ve been happy to play with the superior level constitution Luo Jianqing before, and now it avoided him like the plague.No matter how Luo Jianqing worked his cultivation methods, nowhere within three zhang of his body had even a single drop of universal qi.What Luo Jianqing was practicing was Yu Xiao Peak\u2019s unique cultivation method, the True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record, that was always kept hidden. This was Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s most protected secret. It was said that in those years what Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s grandmasters studied was that very cultivation method, and relied on them to levitate heavenwards and achieve immortality.There was absolutely nothing wrong with the True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record, but this spiritual influence was unwilling to get close to him.For a long time, Luo Jianqing sat on the praying mat, thinking about this issue, but in the end he still couldn\u2019t come up with an answer. When he had just reincarnated, he was already firmly in the middle stage of Core Formation, and now he had fallen to the beginning of the middle stage. If he fell down like this again, he was afraid that in one year he could drop to the early stage of Core Formation.After meditating inside his bamboo house for a month, Luo Jianqing got up to face the vast blue sky, and suddenly he had a thought\u2026\u201cCould it be that the heavens cannot tolerate me any longer?\u201dNaturally, the heavens had no way to answer him, but the inside of his body couldn\u2019t grow any more. Besides, the still slowly dropping boundaries was enough answer for Luo Jianqing.But Luo Jianqing did not get angry. He already resented the unjust will of the heavens, and although he knew his world was merely a book, being a cultivator was something he truly wanted. Cultivation was his identity. So what if it was just a book? He was still Luo Jianqing, and there was no way he was \u201ca disciple who had one appearance, in reality a filthy, dark, and jealous person\u201d, or so it was written in that book.\u2026Cough cough, maybe he was a little jealous.He didn\u2019t think about it too long, as the time for the new disciples\u2019 first practice experience was approaching. Luo Jianqing packed some essential materials in his storage ring, then went to find the elder who was in charge of leading practice to receive his token.After he took the Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s leader token, Luo Jianqing had just barely come down from Cang Shuang Peak when he glimpsed a distant ball of fire coming from the sky. His immediate reaction was to turn around and run, but he hadn\u2019t taken two steps when he heard a hurt voice behind his back. \u201cSenior brother, do you have to turn and run whenever you see me?\u201dLuo Jianqing forced out two laughs and helplessly turned back around, looking at his little junior sister.From head to foot, she was covered in a fire-red cotton skirt. She had a very small face that had big round eyes with slender tightly knitted eyebrows. She looked extremely sweet and charming, but her arrogant and willful personality set her far apart from the gentleness of women. Instead, she was high-spirited and reckless like the blazing sun above, bursting into thousands of rays of light.The seven great disciples of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s seven peaks, the celebrated and famous young generation of the cultivation world, the Seven Children of Tai Hua Mountain.Among them, though Luo Jianqing wasn\u2019t too old, his cultivation was the highest, and so he was respected as the great senior brother. The other six were currently in the beginning stage of Core Formation, and they could probably go out and start their own sect, but at Tai Hua Mountain, they were still only disciples.Luo Jianqing let out a deep sigh, and said, \u201cJunior sister, I didn\u2019t see you.\u201dMu Tianxin didn\u2019t believe him, and pursed her lips. \u201cSenior brother, you used to call me by my name. You never called me junior sister.\u201dAs she spoke, Mu Tianxin again stepped forward, forcing Luo Jianqing to step back. Mu Tianxin moved forward again, and Luo Jianqing retreated again. And so in this way, the two went one step back and forth on the walkway below Cang Shuang Peak. At this rate, they would be back at Cang Shuang Peak. The junior brothers and sisters watched them curiously. Luo Jianqing finally stopped moving and adjusted his expression to ask, \u201cXin\u2019er, what did you come to see me for?\u201dAt hearing \u201cXin\u2019er\u201d, the charming young lady immediately beamed in happiness, but coughed, trying to feign indifference and hide her sounds of joy. \u201cSenior brother, I heard that you wanted to lead the new disciples this time instead of me. I specially refined these medicine pills for you. Please be careful while traveling.\u201dLuo Jianqing took three small jade bottles from his little junior sister, not knowing whether to cry or laugh. \u201cYou mean these?\u201dMu Tianxin nodded heavily. \u201cYes, these.\u201d Her voice had just fell when her face suddenly burst into a brilliant smile, her big eyes fixed rigidly on Luo Jianqing, fiddling ceaselessly under her sleeves, like she was worried Luo Jianqing would not accept her kindness.He stared at the jade bottles for a long time, then put it inside his storage ring. \u201cJunior sister, I remember that fourth junior brother asked you to refine a third-level medicine pill. You\u2019ve refined these pills for me, so what about fourth junior brother\u2019s?\u201dMu Tianxin waved her hand, not seeming to care in the slightest. Like a dictator, she stated calmly, \u201cI\u2019ll make that boy Xie Zizhuo wait patiently.\u201dLuo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help but laugh. \u201cJunior sister?\u201dIn the next moment, Mu Tianxin also started to laugh softly, without any hint of the small dictator she was acting like just a moment ago.The two talked for a bit on Cang Shuang Peak\u2019s mountain road, then Mu Tianxin urgently hurried back to refine a medicine pill and didn\u2019t stay long. Before leaving, she looked at Luo Jianqing for a while, reluctant to leave, turning around twice every three steps.When she walked to the end of the mountain road, the girl in the red clothes stopped and turned around to face Luo Jianqing, saying loudly, \u201cSenior brother, whether I owe you in your past life, or if I like you, that\u2019s my business. Whether you like me or not, that\u2019s your business. Never use the excuse that you like someone else to reject me again. That\u2019ll break my heart.\u201dRight after her voice fell, the bright red rays flew quickly to the sky and merely left Luo Jianqing standing in his original position, stupefied, and didn\u2019t react for a very long time.Between the precipitous and craggy mountain road, Luo Jianqing lifted his eyes to look at where that ray of red had just left. After a long time, he finally shook his head lightly.He took out the three medicine bottles from his storage, two of which were second-level, and one was surprisingly third-level. Even if his little junior sister was the inheriting great disciple of Qing Lan Peak, refining a third-level medicine pill was no easy task. Such a high level medicine pill could only be achieved in the span of a month. He was afraid\u2026 that little junior sister had not rested very much.Thinking about this, wisps of blood floating in Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes, he sighed wordlessly.\u201cYou didn\u2019t owe me in my past life\u2026 it was I that owed you.\u201dFaint murmurings flooded the atmosphere, and no one was able to make out anything. Suddenly, a stream of green light rose from Cang Shuang Peak and flew straight towards Yu Xiao Peak. Luo Jianqing again returned to his bamboo house. He continued to meditate in seclusion, seeking a solution to his being \u201cuntolerated by the heavens\u201d.Though he couldn\u2019t respond to his little junior sister, he could at least make a promise. \u201cJunior sister, I won\u2019t let anyone bully you.\u201dA month had passed very quickly. Luo Jianqing took Shuang Fu and returned it to between his eyebrows, a green sword mark appearing on his forehead. He took off the white Yu Xiao Peak uniform and changed into a simple, light, green embroidered gown, then stepped outside.When he left Yu Xiao Peak, Luo Jianqing turned his head to look at the bamboo house on the summit. After a long time, he returned his line of sight and walked quickly.The new disciples this time made up twenty-four altogether, which could even be said the most that ever came together in 100 years. Every new disciple all had to go through practice, and this time the leading senior brother was Luo Jianqing. At the same time, there were four Qi Foundation stage disciples who accompanied Luo Jianqing to lead the new disciples.Twelve junior brothers and sisters were already being taken along by the Qi Foundation stage disciples. When Luo Jianqing caught up to them, the remaining twelve disciples were all standing straight as an arrow, watching him with big eyes. Their gazes carried curiosity, reverence, and gratitude\u2026Yi? Gratitude?!Luo Jianqing turned his head and only saw the little girl Liu Xiaoxiao waving her hand incessantly at him, and mouthed, \u201cThank you big sister.\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dEven if you don\u2019t talk, he can still tell what you\u2019re saying, you know!Luo Jianqing looked down at the twelve new disciples, directly ignoring the little Liu Xiaoxiao\u2019s fiery gaze. A cold and calm qi field dispersed into the surroundings, pressuring the crowd of children so that they couldn\u2019t breathe deeply.Luo Jianqing said neutrally, \u201cThose who have gotten on the transporting formation, hold hands and be sure not to separate. Those who entered Qi Foundation, when you enter the transporting formation you will only feel a bit of dizziness, so it would be best if you endured it. Now, come up one by one.\u201dThe little radishes nodded obediently, each and every one of them walking to the transporting formation.After the last one went up, Luo Jianqing stepped up, standing in front of the twelve people. He turned his head to look at the two disciples in charge of the transporting formation. He lightly nodded, and the two cupped their hands to salute him, saying simultaneously, \u201cGreat senior brother\u201d. Then they put in the spirit stones in the trough, preparing to start the transporting formation.In a flash, the whole world was flooded in white light, boundless, powerful spiritual energy soaring, wrapping up Luo Jianqing and the twelve radishes. Naturally, the transporting formation\u2019s oppressive aura was nothing to Luo Jianqing, but to the little radishes, it was the first time they had been assaulted with spiritual energy. Seeing that it was becoming nearly unbearable for the little radishes, Luo Jianqing helplessly shook his head, flicking his sleeves to block some spiritual energy for the little radishes.A second later, he saw a little radish looking at him, eyes brimming with tears as he nodded his head with emotion.Luo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026I was just doing it in passing.\u201dThe little radish strained to nod his head. \u201cThank you senior brother, thank you senior brother!\u201dSeeing this small radish being so emotional, Luo Jianqing secretly found it amusing, and felt a little warm inside.The transporting formation was slow to start, but by the time the thirteen people were really about to be transported, there was a flash of golden sword-light in the horizon. Luo Jianqing only heard a voice echoing in his mind: \u201cJianqing, did your master not tell you to concentrate on cultivation?\u201dHis voice was as cold as always, but for some reason, Luo Jianqing felt like he heard a bit of urgency.When this voice echoed in his heart, Luo Jianqing\u2019s entire body shivered, then he slowly calmed down. He sent a voice transmission back. \u201cMaster, as the great senior brother of Tai Hua Mountain, I ought to guide these new disciples through practice.\u201dA long time had passed before Xuan Lingzi\u2019s voice said deep and low, \u201cJianqing, do you truly want to leave?\u201dLuo Jianqing grit his teeth and said, \u201cMaster, the transporting formation has already begun.\u201dAfter waiting for some time, Luo Jianqing thought that his master didn\u2019t want to speak with him any more. But surprisingly, a ray of golden sword-light split cleanly towards his forehead. Luo Jianqing\u2019s pupils shrunk and had just took his sword to defend himself, but he heard Xuan Lingzi\u2019s apathetic voice echo in his mind, \u201cThis red seal carried a little thought of your master\u2019s. If you dare not to concentrate on cultivation on the way, your master will surely know.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 7": "Chapter 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe scorching sun was already overhead when Luo Jianqing brought the twelve little radishes to Liangzhou\u2019s Yi Tian City.The twelve Qi Foundation cultivators who were all dressed alike, plus the handsome, solitary Core Formation cultivator, formed a battle formation that was too powerful, attracting many people\u2019s attention the entire journey. They could not fly in the city, so Luo Jianqing and the others came down from the flying magical tool and stepped into Yi Tian City.They were just about to enter the city when Luo Jianqing saw the four Qi Foundation junior brothers and sisters, as well as the other twelve new disciples.The four disciples saluted Luo Jianqing one after another when they saw him, yelling, \u201cGreat senior brother.\u201dThe twelve newcomers also immediately saluted. \u201cGreat senior brother.\u201dLuo Jianqing faintly nodded, sweeping a mild gaze over them. When he saw Li Xiuchen, he didn\u2019t react, but only calmly shifted his line of sight. Then he guided the crowd to Yi Tian City\u2019s stronghold and took the men Yi Tian Sect had prepared.Today, they stopped to rest in the largest tavern of the city. A man as tall and strong as a horse saw Luo Jianqing, surprise flashing through his eyes. Then he cupped his hands and said, \u201cFellow Daoist, I am Liu Dong, an elder of Yi Tian Sect. Concerning the matter of the Hidden Realm, my sect has already assigned people to investigate. Today we will invite everyone to rest for the time being in this guest house. Tomorrow morning I will lead everyone to the entrance of the Hidden Realm.\u201d He paused and said, \u201cWhat is this fellow Daoist called?\u201dTo others, Luo Jianqing\u2019s expression was calm as he said neutrally, \u201cLuo Jianqing.\u201dThe man was startled, his eyes wide. After a while, he lowered his head and said, \u201cFellow Daoist Luo.\u201dAfter the four Qi Foundation disciples made the proper arrangements for all twenty four newcomers, Elder Liu left unhurriedly. Before leaving, he quietly sized up Luo Jianqing several times with a complex and unreadable look.Luo Jianqing doesn\u2019t pay attention to these sorts of trivial matters, but he knew what this elder was thinking.The reputation of the Seven Children of Tai Hua has long spread all over China. In \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d, when Elder Liu heard the leader was the little junior sister, the Last of Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children, he had the same reaction. After all, for a small sect like Yi Tian Sect, the strongest had only passed no further than the late stage of Core Formation. Even Elder Liu just then was only in the late stage of Qi Foundation.At Tai Hua Mountain, it was only possible to become an elder by attaining late stage Core Formation as well as establishing great merit. All the regular elders were above Nascent Soul stage. Among the seven peaks, Sir Xuan Lingzi of Yu Xiao Peak was the only cultivator on Earth who reached Spirit-Refining. For the other six peaks, the fifth Peak Lord was at the Mahayana stage, and only Yu Qingzi was at the Calamity Passage stage.Tai Hua Mountain was located right in the heart of China. Yu Xiao Peak was so high it clashed against the skies, and it was said that it towered above all living things. Among the millions and millions of places Tai Hua Mountain encompassed, the schools there all received Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s protection. Their only request was that when they found any remnants of the Hidden Realm, they must inform Tai Hua Mountain so they could explore them.It seemed that these remnants that the Nascent Soul cultivator of Yi Tian Sect discovered was only one among others.Yet Tai Hua Mountain still looked down on the remnants that the Nascent Soul cultivator found. But fortunately, this was the first time the newcomers had come out for practice in ten years, so the sect leader let the new disciples come here to learn.This seemed to be very similar to \u201cpaying tribute\u201d which was a good thing for these small sects. As they said, treasuring a jade ring turns into a crime, and since their strength was not enough to protect their treasure, they could only rely on Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s protection, which benefit them.That night, after Luo Jianqing finished meditating in cultivation, a Qi Foundation disciple came to him.The disciple was from Hao Ming Peak, and it could also be said that he was a trusted follower of Xie Zizhuo\u2019s. After he entered Luo Jianqing\u2019s room, he immediately said tactfully, \u201cSenior brother, my senior brother Xie told me to tell you that he doesn\u2019t like that thing you don\u2019t like either. So at this time, the thing you don\u2019t like has been handled properly.\u201d After speaking, he chuckled.Luo Jianqing raised an eyebrow. \u201cHow did he handle it?\u201dThe disciple looked all around him. Luo Jianqing coolly waved a hand to set up an enchanted boundary, cutting them off from anyone who might watch.The disciple explained, \u201cWe Hao Ming Peak do not like that Li Xiuchen. You know that the next sect-wide competition is less than a year away and last time, Hao Ming Peak came in second-last. We were only ahead of Qing Feng Peak by a little bit, and they devote themselves to refining medicine pills. Everyone at our peak is very driven, and we want to work hard and climb up. Who would\u2019ve guessed that some lucky bastard with no constitution came along, and what\u2019s more he\u2019s a newcomer that thinks he\u2019s better than everyone else.\u201dWith competition came motivation, and the ranking at the sect-wide competition was just and fair. The disciple continued, \u201cAlso, what\u2019s strange is that after Li Xiuchen came to Hao Ming Peak, he didn\u2019t properly cultivate and just gave up. And he would also run to the back of the mountain practically every day. Every single new disciple has reached Qi Foundation already, while he\u2019s just wasting time.\u201dHaving heard what was said, Luo Jianqing finally wrinkled his eyebrows. \u201cToday I saw that he was already at the second phase of Qi Foundation.\u201dThe disciple immediately nodded. \u201cExactly! This is the strange part. Obviously he never cultivated, but half a month ago he suddenly entered Qi Foundation, and after seven days he entered the second phase! Even senior brother Xie thought this was very strange. He doesn\u2019t like him, and sent some disciples to provoke him, even taking away his meals, but anyway he was really angry and confronted us, and also\u2026\u201dAt this point, the disciple stopped. After thinking for a long time, he finally said, \u201cRight! Li Xiuchen said, \u2018Thirty years the river runs east, thirty years the river runs west, (1) do not deceive a poor young man\u2019. He was talking while standing on top of a rock looking at us all high and mighty. Then he said he will leave us behind in the end and make us into his stepping stones. So senior brother Xie didn\u2019t talk to him and planned for a few new disciples to beat him up.\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe disciple spoke with an admiring expression, \u201cSenior brother Xie truly deserves to be our senior brother Xie. He only said one sentence and made Li Xiuchen speechless. He said, \u2018Laozi is at the Core Formation stage, you are at the Qi Foundation stage. We Hao Ming Peak are as strong as kings. Do you believe that Laozi can crush you with just a finger?\u2019\u201dLuo Jianqing finally let out a snort. \u201cPfft.\u201dThe disciple still continued to talk about Li Xiuchen\u2019s run ins with bad luck at Hao Ming Peak. After an hour, he finally left Luo Jianqing\u2019s room. Before he left, the disciple looked at the sword mark on Luo Jianqing\u2019s forehead in astonishment, and couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cSenior brother Luo, I did not know you were\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing sensed the disciple\u2019s gaze and opened the door with a flick of his sleeve, saying indifferently, \u201cIt\u2019s just a little something. You don\u2019t need to worry about it.\u201dIt was obvious that Luo Jianqing wanted to see him out, so the disciple did not dare to ask any further. He cupped his hands in salute, then left immediately.After there was only one person left in the room, Luo Jianqing raised his hand up into the air to draw a water mirror, looking at his reflection peacefully.If someone practiced Yu Xiao Peak\u2019s unrivaled cultivation method, the True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record, then practiced the sword, a sword mark would form on the forehead. This sword mark was shaped like a nine-petaled lotus. From the beginning of the Qi Foundation stage, the first petal of the design would open, then a second petal at Core Formation\u2026 at the Spirit-Refining stage, there would be eight petals opened altogether, and finally when someone flew heavenwards and became immortal, they would attain the ninth petal, becoming the nine-petaled lotus. From that point on, they could gallop all over the world, unstoppable.Luo Jianqing currently had a two-petaled green sword mark on his forehead, whereas Xuan Lingzi\u2019s golden sword mark already had eight petals.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s thought had entered Luo Jianqing\u2019s stream of consciousness and took shape in the form of this red seal. Luo Jianqing had rushed to Yi Tian City, carefully examining the red seal the entire journey, but in the end, it was unable to be covered up, much less removed.That person was a Spirit-Refining Stage cultivator. Even though he himself was very gifted, he still hadn\u2019t gotten past Core Formation.Both were separated by five great boundaries. Even if it was merely a thought, he couldn\u2019t resist the other person.Looking at the red seal in the water mirror for ages, Luo Jianqing slowly restrained his pupils and dispersed the water mirror with a flick of his sleeve. He slowly turned around to meditate, following what that person said and concentrate on cultivating.On the second day, he watched the Qi Foundation disciples around him, then watched the twenty-four new disciples. After that, he nodded with satisfaction and activated the flying magical tool, letting everyone get on, and headed towards the remnants together.This time, it was not the Qi Foundation Elder Liu who showed the way for Luo Jianqing, but instead an old early-stage Core Formation man. He cupped his hands in salute, saying, \u201cYi Tian Sect did not know that Tai Hua Mountain had surprisingly assigned fellow Daoist Luo as the leader this time. There was truly no respect shown yesterday. This one is the third elder of Yi Tian Sect, Cao Haining. This time, a specialist has come to guide our fellow Daoist. I hope that fellow Daoist Luo will find it in himself to forgive us, please do not be angry.\u201d\u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d didn\u2019t mention Yi Tian Sect replacing the guide, but Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t mind. After he spoke a couple sentences with Elder Luo, he returned to his own room and opened an enchantment boundary, continuing to meditate in cultivation.Sixth junior brother had sent this flying magical tool to Luo Jianqing a few years ago. Its external appearance was a treasure ship, and had eighty-one rooms in total. It was two times slower than a Core Formation cultivator, but it was very cozy and quite suitable for transporting these little radishes.When they approached the remnants, Luo Jianqing put away the magical tool and headed towards the land with the other disciples.Naturally, cultivators had extraordinarily strong legs, but the remnants were deep in the Yi Tian Mountains. They walked for an entire day, but not a trace of the remnants could be seen. Elder Cao, worried that Luo Jianqing would misunderstand, immediately cupped his hands and said, \u201cFellow Daoist Luo, these remnants are in the depths of the Yi Tian Mountains, and they are completely hidden from sight. We must travel for another day before we arrive.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded in acknowledgment.With how strong his and Elder Cao\u2019s legs are, it was natural that they would soon arrive. But these little radishes were different. Among them, the best of them was not anything more than Phase Four of Qi Condensation, and a dozen or so of them were merely new cultivators who had just reached Phase One of Qi Condensation. They had done well keeping up to now and being undemanding.At night, the party sat on a mat in the meadow of the mountain woods. Everyone was divided up at two bonfires, while Luo Jianqing had his own. Even though Cao Haining and Luo Jianqing were both Core Formation cultivators, he knew that at Qi Foundation, the first of Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children had once killed a demonic cultivator who was at the early stage of Core Formation. He was so powerful that he could match his strength.Elder Cao looked at Luo Jianqing distantly and sighed in sorrow. \u201cFellow Daoist Luo is truly hard-working, cultivating on the entire journey.\u201dA Qi Foundation disciple laughed. \u201cElder Cao, you don\u2019t really get it. Our great senior brother is the famous madman of Tai Hua Mountain. In those years, senior brother wasn\u2019t anything more than a baby when martial uncle Xuan Lingzi brought him to Tai Hua Mountain. That time, second senior brother had reached Qi Foundation long ago, and he was older than great senior brother by a year! But now? Great senior brother already reached the middle stage of Core Formation, and second senior brother hasn\u2019t reached anything higher than the early stage of Core Formation.\u201dElder Cao said, aghast, \u201cIs fellow Daoist Luo really so audacious?\u201dAnother Qi Foundation disciple explained, \u201cActually, it should be said that martial uncle Xuan Lingzi was extremely harsh to great senior brother. Apparently in those days, great senior brother could break martial uncle Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Qi Foundation record, but martial uncle Xuan Lingzi said great senior brother\u2019s foundation wasn\u2019t stable enough, and stubbornly made great senior brother go to Wan Shou Mountains to kill demon beasts for three years. After that, he let him pass Qi Foundation.\u201d He paused to sigh. \u201cGreat senior brother was only around ten years old at that time\u2026\u201dElder Cao\u2019s eyes were wide with fright. \u201cSir Xuan Lingzi is truly\u2026 truly spirited!\u201dEveryone laughed loudly.Gossiping like this, even if someone reached Core Formation, would inevitably lead to depravity. Very soon, the sly foxes Qi Foundation disciples began to tell a story about some sex scandals on Tai Hua Mountain. Excluding Elder Cao, the rest of the new Qi Condensation disciples strained their ears to listen with curiosity.In the pitch black night, no one saw Li Xiuchen sneakily stand up and move next to a bonfire not far away.Luo Jianqing set up an enchanted boundary for himself so cultivators below Core Formation could not approach him. However, he did not set up an enchanted boundary that was soundproof. Li Xiuchen looked at Luo Jianqing up and down with an odd look, and finally whispered, \u201cTV set?\u201dLuo Jianqing still had his eyes closed in cultivation.Li Xiuchen said again, \u201cComputers? Contra? Internet?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s expression was unperturbed. His radiant face contrasted against the flames, making him even more shockingly beautiful.Li Xiuchen continued to ask incessantly, \u201cBrothers, the 2008 Olympics? Korean groups? The four heavenly kings of Hong Kong?\u201dLi Xiuchen had been talking for a whole three minutes, but not once did Luo Jianqing raise his eyes. Right when he was about to say something else, he saw Luo Jianqing suddenly open his eyes and fix his ice-cold gaze on him. Li Xiuchen\u2019s entire body shook. When he was on the verge of opening his mouth, Luo Jianqing flung his wide sleeve. Li Xiuchen wailed as he was flung a complete ten meters away. He knocked into a large tree, producing a loud monstrous sound.Everyone nearby who had been gossiping, \u201c\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing rose and brushed dust off his body, and said with a cold expression, \u201cShut up. Go back to your own spot.\u201dLi Xiuchen grit his teeth and got up. When he returned to his spot, Luo Jianqing had sat back down a while ago, continuing to meditate.At this time, Li Xiuchen was suffering while staring at Luo Jianqing with eyes full of threat and wrath. He muttered quietly, \u201cThirty years a river runs east, thirty years a river runs west. Right now, you may be pleased with yourself, but wait until\u2026 ah!\u201dThe other disciples looked appalled when they saw Li Xiuchen fall three or four meters down, then knock into another several-hundred year old tree. For some inexplicable reason, his face had another shoe print on it. Blood slowly flowed from his nostrils. This time, he was completely knocked out.Everyone didn\u2019t understand what had happened except the early-stage Core Formation Elder Cao, who wiped off his sweat with a shaking hand. Secretly, he thought, \u201cThis\u2026 this power is truly astonishing. Luo Jianqing is as quick as lightning, and I didn\u2019t even see how he kicked him. And he even went back to meditate.\u201dTruly, no one is deceiving me. This is the First of Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children! He was really worthy of the title First of Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children!After a day, everyone was finally approaching where the remnants were supposed to be. Li Xiuchen felt disgruntled as he followed behind everyone else, the shoe print still on his face. No matter how he washed it, it wouldn\u2019t come off, so he could only walk with his head bowed and a shoe print on his face.Not long after, they saw a middle-stage Core Formation cultivator walk towards them in mid-air. First he nodded to Elder Cao, and exchanged glances. Then he turned his head to face the graceful and renowned green-clothed cultivator in the crowd, cupping his hands in a salute. \u201cFellow Daoist Luo, I, Yi Tian Sect\u2019s second elder of Zhao Yu Peak who leads thirty Qi Condensation disciples and twelve Qi Foundation disciples, have been looking forward to this for a long time.\u201d(1) Thirty years the river runs east, thirty years the river runs west (\u4e09\u5341\u5e74\u6cb3\u4e1c\uff0c\u4e09\u5341\u5e74\u6cb3\u897f): Describes natural cycles, rising and falling\u2026 ah, Li Xiuchen, you embarrass me just reading about you\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 8": "Chapter 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe second elder of Yi Tian Sect said that he brought thirty Qi Condensation disciples and twelve Qi Foundation disciples. It appeared that they had many more people than Tai Hua Mountain, but in fact, if they were matched up against each other, the twelve Qi Foundation disciples would be no match for Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s four Qi Foundation disciples.Of the four Tai Hua Mountain Qi Foundation disciples, the oldest had cultivated for no more than fifty years, and the youngest wasn\u2019t even thirty years old yet. And in Yi Tian Sect, the youngest Qi Foundation disciple was already sixty years old, and in addition, many of the disciples relied on taking medicine pills to force their way to Qi Foundation, as their foundation was very weak.On one side, Yi Tian Sect had twelve people who reached Qi Foundation. Only one was at the middle-stage, while the rest were all early-stage.And on the other, Tai Hua Mountain had only one who was at early-stage Qi Foundation and one who was at middle-stage Qi Foundation. Besides these two, everyone else was in the late-stage of Qi Foundation.These ordinary sects did not dare try to figure out the internal affairs of great sects, which was why yesterday after Elder Liu had heard the leader was surprisingly Luo Jianqing, he rushed to report to his sect. Finally, Yi Tian Sect assigned the early-stage Core Formation Cao Haining to personally welcome Luo Jianqing.Since the two groups had assembled, the first order of business was to merge into one group and prepare to enter the remnants.When Yi Tian Sect\u2019s disciples saw Luo Jianqing walking, they couldn\u2019t help widening their eyes. Every single one was looking at him attentively, the gazes of many girls drawn to Luo Jianqing like magnets. On the green hills and under the bright sun, the great senior brother looked noble in his cyan clothes, the sword mark on his forehead adorned with a tiny scarlet mole. Indeed he looked bright and elegant, with divine poise and sagelike features.\u201cThat person must be a senior brother of Tai Hua Mountain, right? Surely he is a Qi Foundation senior brother!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m positive that he\u2019s in the late stage of Qi Foundation, he\u2019s from Tai Hua Mountain after all.\u201d\u201cRight, he must be in the late stage of Qi Foundation! So awesome.\u201dAlthough they spoke mostly in voice transmissions and everyone else including Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t hear them at all, watching these young girls stare and point at their own senior brother made all of the Qi Foundation disciples smile in understanding, everyone chuckling in solidarity.After both groups were ready, everyone entered under the guidance of Yi Tian Sect\u2019s Elder Zhao.The endless ranges of mountains were winding and snaking, like streams coming together to form an ocean, and finally ended at a tall and erect peak. They abruptly stopped, and Luo Jianqing activated the flying magical tool and led the disciples to the clear sky. Everyone assembled on the deck and looked down at the bony crowd of mountains.On the treasure ship, Yi Tian Sect\u2019s Elder Zhao suddenly soared into the air, taking out a smooth and round white jade pearl.Upon seeing this, Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples looked at it several times with curiosity. Only Luo Jianqing cleanly swept his gaze over it once, then moved away his line of sight.Elder Zhao tossed the white pearl into the air, his fingers moving in succession, forming a hologram. The white pearl was emitting a glaring light, its rays penetrating through the clouds as it directly launched towards the top of the peak. In a flash, there was a sound of rumbling, and a screen of white light suddenly emerged in front of everyone\u2019s eyes.Elder Zhao cupped his hands and said, \u201cFellow Daoist Luo, ahead we will find the remnants that the Nascent Soul True Lord found. This one will still guide everyone through this stage. Let us depart!\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded. \u201cLet us depart!\u201dVery soon, the flying treasure ship passed inside the rays of light. Everyone suddenly felt the world fluctuate. Luo Jianqing put back the treasure ship inside his storage ring and lifted his head to look at this bizarre place.The black iron gate stretched thirty-three zhang tall, towering over everyone and emitting a heavy oppressive aura. Though it was a gate, this gate had no doors whatsoever, only wide open to let people in. Everyone stood in front of the gate, as tiny as a drop in the ocean.Suddenly seeing this kind of gate, the disciples couldn\u2019t help glancing all around them, at a loss.Elder Zhao said aloud, \u201cTrue Lord Beidou\u2019s most skilled formation is the Ursa Major Formation. This gate is the first mountain pass of the remnants, known as Yaoguang(1). There are many small characters on the side of the gate that detail the requirements to enter the gate. Those who enter the gate must not be older than 100 years old and cultivation level must be Nascent Soul or lower. Yi Tian Sect had once dispatched cultivators who did not meet the conditions and were all shot out of the gate with critical injuries.\u201dHis voice fell. Luo Jianqing nodded indifferently, then turned his head to look at a new disciple of Tai Hua Mountain.This disciple was the child from the aristocratic family who won first place at the all-peak examinations. He tactfully nodded and took a step into the gate. Having passed unobstructed, he quickly entered, then turned around and said, \u201cGreat senior brother, everything\u2019s alright.\u201dThe words \u201cgreat senior brother\u201d had just fallen when Yi Tian City\u2019s disciples stood dumbly in place, like they had been struck by lightning.\u201cGreat\u2026 great senior brother? Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s great senior brother?!\u201dEveryone looked to the front of the crowd with looks of disbelief. The calm and composed young man Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t seem to notice them and was assigning every one of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples to enter the gate. When there was only one person left, he said, \u201cAfter you, Elder Zhao.\u201dZhao Yu Peak originally felt completely embarrassed. These were the remnants that their Yi Tian Sect had discovered, but they had to let Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples go in first. When Luo Jianqing remained where he was, not taking the initiative to enter, Elder Zhao looked at him gratefully and cupped his hands in salute, then let his disciples enter.When the last Yi Tian Sect disciple went in, the only people remaining outside the gate were Luo Jianqing and Yi Tian Sect\u2019s elders.Luo Jianqing glanced coolly at Yi Tian Sect\u2019s elders. Then he stood on his toes, his silhouette turning into green light, and swiftly entered the gate.Henceforth, the affairs inside the gate had nothing to do with the people outside, and Yi Tian Sect\u2019s guidance was no longer needed at this point.After entering True Lord Beidou\u2019s remnants, the oldest of Yi Tian Sect\u2019s Qi Foundation disciples timidly walked over to talk things over with Luo Jianqing. Luo Jianqing said mildly, \u201cThen walk with Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples. There\u2019s no need to worry.\u201dThe person immediately let out a sigh of relief.Inside the black iron gate, there was a quiet and pitch-black trail. Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples took out a moonstone from their sleeves which emitted faint and dim light. Although it was not as bright as sunlight, it was enough.Everyone walked like this for an hour. The trail became wider, and the more they walked the more clearly they could hear sounds of crashing water. When they had just reached the end, even Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help but look surprised.\u201cWhat a big river!\u201d\u201cA huge river! It\u2019s not just a big river, it\u2019s a huge river!\u201dMuddy river water surged up from somewhere far, crashing against the mountain walls with vigor and grandeur. The water was dark yellow, but its waves were very violent. As Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyesight was not good enough to make out how far the river water spread, he could only see that the water didn\u2019t just stop at 100 li (2)!It was 100 li long and already opened up a small space!The opened space was definitely something that was made with the powerful ability of a Body-Fusion stage cultivator. Clearly it was not True Lord Beidou\u2019s doing. He surely received some kind of treasure, only then could he create such unnatural Nascent Soul level remnants for himself!Luo Jianqing glanced at it, then soon saw a green stone tablet standing right in the middle of the river water.The stone tablet was at least a li away from the shore. Only Qi Foundation and above was able to read the words on it.The one Tai Hua Mountain disciple read aloud, \u201cSuch vast and mighty waters, whence must there be a vessel?\u201dA Qi Condensation disciple yelled immediately, \u201cThere\u2019s a boat here! There\u2019s a lot of boats here!\u201dThe Qi Foundation disciple continued to read, \u201cSeventh-level may carry one, across one li; sixth-level may carry two, across two li; fifth-level may carry four, across four li; fourth-level may carry eight, across eight li; third-level may carry sixteen, across sixteen li; second-level may carry thirty-two, across thirty-two li; first-level may carry sixty-four, across sixty-four li. The heavenly superior-level may carry 128, across 128 li!\u201dHis voice fell. Of the disciples who were all completely silent, only Luo Jianqing knit his brows, while Li Xiuchen laughed vulgarly.The words on the stone tablet were too simple. All cultivators were divided into nine kinds of constitutions. First, people who had no constitution, like Li Xiuchen; second, people who had a lower grade constitution, from fourth to seventh-level; third, second and third level, which were medium grade; and lastly, an outstanding first-level constitution. Out of countless people, not one had a superior-level constitution!A superior-level constitution was hard to come by. It already defied the natural order.Among millions and millions of people, only one was suitable for cultivation. And among countless cultivators, only one could have a superior-level constitution.On Tai Hua Mountain, there were only two who had a superior-level constitution. One was Sir Xuan Lingzi, while the other was Luo Jianqing.Li Xiuchen, stained with a dirty black shoe print, eyes giving off a bright radiance, looked towards the great senior brother in green who was standing at the side of the river.Though Li Xiuchen had no evidence, he still believed that he and Luo Jianqing both transmigrated. Otherwise, according to the original work, at this moment it would be impossible for everyone to cross the river. What should\u2019ve happened was little junior sister\u2014and also his first harem member\u2014would carry a total of sixty-four people, then let two first-level constitution disciples carry five disciples. Everyone worked strenuously, used many magical tools, and finally crossed the river with great difficulty.But right now, everything was different.The little junior sister Mu Tianxin had a first-level constitution. Although a first-level constitution was the best of the best, it wasn\u2019t superior-level.But Luo Jianqing\u2019s constitution was!This made the first mountain pass too easy to cross. Let Luo Jianqing captain the boat and take everyone. It was a piece of cake.Thinking of this while watching the Yi Tian Sect disciples hesitate and worry, Li Xiuchen chuckled and said, \u201cDon\u2019t worry. Everyone knows that our Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s great senior brother has a superior-level constitution. He can carry the seventy of us and more!\u201dLi Xiuchen\u2019s voice directly passed through every single person\u2019s ears. Yi Tian Sect all looked dumbstruck. Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples stared at him peculiarly.Some of the Yi Tian Sect disciples still didn\u2019t exactly know what was with that shoe print on his face, but after hearing him talk, many disciples couldn\u2019t help whispering apprehensively, \u201cWe didn\u2019t know that Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s great senior brother had a superior-level constitution, but why would he carry us anyway\u2026\u201d\u201cExactly, he doesn\u2019t have a superior-level constitution so why\u2019s he so proud of himself?\u201d\u201cWhat constitution does this Tai Hua Mountain disciple have, maybe first-level?\u201dThese people spoke very quietly, and as Li Xiuchen wasn\u2019t anything more than Phase Two of Qi Condensation, he couldn\u2019t hear them at all. However, Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Phase Four Qi Condensation disciples were listening to them talk with their heads lowered in resentment, while four Qi Foundation disciples had their lips pulled taut. One of the Hao Ming Peak disciples slapped Li Xiuchen on the back of the head, making him stumble and nearly fall to the ground.\u201cGo ahead and speak! Do you know what you\u2019ve just done? Do you? You made our Hao Ming Peak completely lose face!\u201dLi Xiuchen covered his head, looking at the Hao Ming Peak senior brother with anger. He didn\u2019t understand what he said wrong at all.Since someone already pointed out the situation, naturally Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t hide anything. He waved his hand to summon the largest boat and said neutrally, \u201cEveryone get on the boat. This river goes for over 100 li. I don\u2019t know where it will take everyone, but let\u2019s take it step by step.\u201dAll of the Yi Tian Sect disciples looked at Luo Jianqing gratefully.After everyone boarded the boat, Li Xiuchen got on it with a face full of hatred. He had just stepped on the deck when Luo Jianqing stated calmly, \u201cYou nineteen junior brothers, shut this person\u2019s mouth for me.\u201dThe nineteen Hao Ming Peak junior brothers cheerfully cupped their hands. \u201cYes! Great senior brother!\u201dLi Xiuchen widened his eyes in shock. He hadn\u2019t yet understood what happened when his mouth stuffed with a chunk of sackcloth. It was unknown where this sackcloth came from, and it even stunk a little bit. Li Xiuchen was about to lift a hand to take the sackcloth out, but Luo Jianqing glanced down at him. When Li Xiuchen wanted to lift his hand again, his entire body was stiff as a corpse, unable to move an inch.Li Xiuchen, \u201cWuwu\u2026 wu!\u201dLuo Jianqing turned around. \u201cA small internal matter in our sect has been settled. I\u2019ll let you laugh.\u201dThe Yi Tian Sect disciples hurriedly shook their heads, pretending not to see Li Xiuchen. \u201cNo matter, no matter. Go ahead, fellow Daoist Luo!\u201dThough they were very grateful that Li Xiuchen opened his mouth to let them get on the boat, if they were Tai Hua Mountain disciples, they would definitely be so furious that they\u2019d die.After everyone boarded the boat, Luo Jianqing walked to the bow of the ship and looked at the enormous jewel. He narrowed his eyes and put his hand on the top, transmitting his spiritual energy through it. In an instant, a bright light suddenly appeared and the ship immediately came to a stop. After a moment, the large ship rumbled loudly and broke the wind as it sped forward at an unstoppable and ambitious velocity!For the entire 128 li, Luo Jianqing kept a calm expression, not even wrinkling his eyebrows.After they reached the shore, Luo Jianqing was the first one to get off the boat. His toes touched the ground lightly, his green robe cutting a beautiful arc in the air. Don\u2019t mention the Tai Hua Mountain disciples; even the Yi Tian Sect disciples felt admiration blossom in their hearts, eyes full of reverence.After everyone walked for several hundred li, someone suddenly remembered, \u201cYi, just now that Tai Hua Mountain disciple looked like he couldn\u2019t move, and he hadn\u2019t come with us!\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s lips turned up slightly as he said quietly, \u201cI forgot.\u201dEveryone, \u201c\u2026\u201d Did you really?!Luo Jianqing flicked his sleeve and a flowing stream of light flew to the river bank. After a few minutes, everyone saw the shoe print stained Li Xiuchen miserably catch up with them. He stood at the very back of the procession, not even raising his head or saying a single word, like he truly did learn from his mistakes.Luo Jianqing only glanced at him once, then returned his line of sight and continued to lead everyone forwards.Li Xiuchen didn\u2019t speak. Did he truly not understand after all?When the boat stopped, Luo Jianqing had been the first one to get off, which totally did not fit his nature. It was all because of that moment when the small boat stopped. A jade-white ray of light suddenly flew by and Luo Jianqing came out, then took the prize of the mountain pass for himself.This prize was a treasure, even to Luo Jianqing.This was a white jade token. In \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d, after little junior sister obtained the white jade token and crushed it, she could shift a distance of sixty-four li. It was a magical tool used to escape. And now that Luo Jianqing had the white jade token, he could move 128 li in the blink of an eye!In his past life, Li Xiuchen got the first-level white jade token at the very end, though he didn\u2019t get it himself. Little junior sister didn\u2019t get anything useful at the remnants, so she gave everything she obtained to Li Xiuchen, hoping it would be enough for him to keep his promise. What happened that night should not be mentioned.But now\u2026 Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes curved in a faint smile, and continued to walk forwards.Now, Li Xiuchen wished he\u2019d gotten it!(1) True Lord Beidou (\u5317\u6597\u771f\u541b): Also a name of a deity in Daoism. Originated from ancient Chinese worship of the Ursa Major constellation (Beidou).Yaoguang (\u6447\u5149): A star in Ursa Major, namely Eta Ursae Majoris/Alkaid.(2) Li: 500 metersPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 9": "Chapter 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe scale of these Nascent Soul remnants completely went against Luo Jianqing\u2019s expectations.It was written in \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d that True Lord Beidou\u2019s remnants were created with the Ursa Major Formation. The entrance to the first mountain pass was called Yaoguang Star, and the large river that everyone had just passed through was called Kaiyang Star. Below should be the Ursa Major\u2019s third star, Yuheng Star. Surprisingly, after walking for less than an hour, they still hadn\u2019t reached the end of the road.As the only cultivator with a golden core and the leader of the entire group, Luo Jianqing walked to the very front, as was his duty.The further they walked, the colder it got. Fortunately, the lowest level out of everyone present was Phase One of Qi Condensation, and they could resist the cold, so no one was too affected. Yet when they had walked through the entirety of the trail, everything before their eyes was a vast expanse of white. Countless disciples sighed with emotion and exclaimed with admiration one after another.\u201cCould this be\u2026 the third pass?\u201dSeparated by a screen of white light, a world of ice and snow appeared before everyone\u2019s eyes. Snow blew violently and gales snarled. Even though no one had stepped in it, everyone could feel a bone-chilling chill scuttling from the bottom of their feet to the very center of their heads.This time, the stone tablet was erected directly in front of the snowfield.\u201cVast and boundless white snow, is there no end?\u201d The nineteen junior brothers stared at it for a long time until they turned their head to say to Luo Jianqing, \u201cSenior brother, this must be the Ursa Major Formation\u2019s third pass, Yuheng.\u201dLuo Jianqing lightly nodded. \u201cDo you have the courage to enter?\u201dThe nineteen disciples laughed out loud and took a step inside. \u201cThen, great senior brother, we will try to find a path for everyone!\u201dTheir voices had just fell when the silhouettes of the nineteen junior brothers completely went into the screen of light. What amazed everyone was that they had completely faded away before everyone\u2019s eyes! In the vast snow, there was not the slightest hint of the nineteen junior brothers\u2019 silhouettes. The snowflakes continued to flutter in the air as the furious gales roared, like they were swallowing people.There was immediately an uproar among the crowd. Many people stepped back in fear, but Luo Jianqing turned his head and said, \u201cThe nineteen junior brothers have already entered a different space. From here on out, everyone will be separated during this practice experience. No one can help you anymore. If you truly can\u2019t endure it, remember to immediately turn back. Don\u2019t try to show off. Crush the pieces of jade you got at the start of the black iron gate, and you should be able to evacuate out of the remnants, ending this session.\u201dEveryone simultaneously cupped their hands in salute. \u201cYes, great senior brother!\u201dYi Tian Sect\u2019s disciples nodded as well, like they were trying to dispel other people\u2019s doubts. Luo Jianqing gave everyone an indifferent glance, then suddenly stepped into the screen of light, disappearing from this space.When Luo Jianqing opened his eyes, he had already entered the third pass. There was no one else around him, only seeing nothing but the endless snow. Luo Jianqing thought of raising his spiritual energy, but found out that his cultivation had been suppressed to Qi Foundation stage, so he was no longer capable of flying high up in the air like before.After he calmly gave his surroundings a quick look, Luo Jianqing narrowed his eyes. \u201cThe first pass restricted age and cultivation, the second pass tested innate skill, and the third pass suppresses cultivation. Is it testing perseverance?\u201dAfter a moment, Luo Jianqing began to walk forward.This snow was not considered too deep, but the snow piled to Luo Jianqing\u2019s ankles as he walked step by step. If an ordinary person had come here, even if they didn\u2019t freeze to death, they might have ended up suffering from snow blindness looking at such white snow for so long.Luo Jianqing knew that those disciples that followed him in would\u2019ve gotten their cultivation suppressed by now, becoming truly ordinary people. According to that book, the better a disciple\u2019s constitution was, the harder the trial would become. For example, the aristocratic child who won first place at the all-peak examinations. His cultivation was at Phase Four of Qi Condensation, but he would become an ordinary person here. Plus, he had a first-level constitution. In the book, he had struggled the most to cross the mountain pass.But now, Luo Jianqing was afraid that the title of \u201cmost struggling\u201d had fallen to him.Luo Jianqing lifted the spiritual energy in his body to protect his arteries, while the remainder was put at the bottom of his feet, and walked continuously. He didn\u2019t know how long he had been walking, but it seemed that it had been two hours, while seeming like an entire day at the same time. His surroundings never changed, making him feel like he was making no progress. But the thickly dotted footprints behind his body told him that he had been walking for a very long time.The snowstorm became even more brutal, the gales engulfed in snowflakes, like a knife scraping Luo Jianqing\u2019s cheeks.Luo Jianqing looked down at the ground, as if he didn\u2019t notice the frantic snowstorm, still continuing to walk persistently. The count he had been keeping had reached a hundred li, and now he had walked for another thousand li.When he reached nine thousand li, the snow had finally reached his stomach. Luo Jianqing still did not react, calmly using his spiritual energy to dispel the snowflakes. His behavior seemed to have incurred this place\u2019s wrath, the snowstorm surging downwards, as if flooding the area Luo Jianqing was in.This snow was different from before. Luo Jianqing again used his spiritual energy to push it away.When Luo Jianqing reached an entire ten thousand li, the snow had already submerged nearly his entire body. According to Luo Jianqing\u2019s current cultivation level of Qi Foundation, he could already bigu diet (1) and not have to breathe for a short period of time. However, he would not let this snow bury him!Just when he had walked for ten thousand li, he heard a lingering sigh coming from his surroundings. \u201cA heavenly superior-level, walking in defiance of the natural order. Here, you have a first-level constitution, but even with a superior-level constitution, this is only the beginning. At present, you are still able to turn your head.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s right foot stepped on the ground, and the heavy snow around his body was knocked away with his sword-light. He raised his head to look at the sky. \u201cFor mere Nascent Soul remnants, what could you do to me?\u201d As he spoke, the green light in the middle of his forehead shone, his green sword-mark seeming like it was going to break through his mind. The horizon roared. The tiny red mole was bright as fire, making the snowstorm stop for an instant.His voice had just fell when Luo Jianqing suddenly sped up his pace, continuing to move forward.When he had walked a hundred thousand li, Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t stop panting, and the spiritual energy in his body was about to dry up. Fortunately, after he walked the last step, the snow and ice filled world seemed to transform into a mirage, disappearing completely. It seemed this was a sign that he had gotten through the mountain pass.All of a sudden, his cultivation sharply rose back to middle stage Core Formation. Luo Jianqing caught the talisman that dropped from the sky and examined the reward he\u2019d gotten from the mountain pass. After resting to meditate for a time, he stepped into the fourth pass.\u201cGales that cut like blades, it is not too late!\u201dJust as he stepped into the fourth pass, a fierce wind rumbled loudly like a wild beast. Luo Jianqing had no time to prepare and suddenly stepped back. This path through the pass wasn\u2019t too long, only ten li, so he could pass through it. However, at this moment, the wind that Luo Jianqing faced was absolutely brutal. Every attack was with the strength of a Core Formation cultivator.This time, Luo Jianqing was again unable to treat this lightly. He directly drew out his own defensive magical tool, then very cautiously walked forward. Surprisingly, he hadn\u2019t walked further than a li when the dark level magical tool exploded loudly. Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes were afraid. He took a bottle of the medicine pills that little junior sister gave him and took one.The fourth pass of the Ursa Major Formation was named Tianquan. He didn\u2019t know where True Lord Beidou got so many treasures from, even putting a core of a seventh-level demon beast at the end of the fourth pass. This beast core constantly emitted evil wind. The closer he got, the stronger the attacks became.\u201cThis demon beast must be a wind-attribute demon beast. Its original body also has an Out of Body cultivation level. I\u2019m afraid that if I get too close to it, the evil wind will reach Out of Body level.\u201d Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyebrows furrowed. He stopped at three li and didn\u2019t walk any further. \u201cA seventh-level wind-attribute demon beast\u2026 Out of Body\u2026\u201dA light flashed through his eyes. Luo Jianqing took an oil-paper umbrella from behind his back.This oil-paper umbrella seemed normal, but the surface was a faint golden color, matching the decorative designs. The material of the frame also seemed to be ordinary green bamboo. Light and simple, it appeared to be an ordinary person\u2019s oil-paper umbrella.However, as soon as he opened the umbrella, the violent winds suddenly stopped for a moment. Luo Jianqing looked at the umbrella with a complex gaze, and slowly opened it above his head. After he opened the umbrella, the devastating gale\u2019s ardent winds completely avoided it and never dared to assault him.The golden light on the umbrella\u2019s surface flowed softly. Luo Jianqing held the umbrella forwards, walking step by step until the end, and took the seventh-level beast core. The moment after he took the beast core, the gales faded away. Luo Jianqing sighed softly and tenderly put away his umbrella. He didn\u2019t notice the red mole on his forehead shine faintly, then becoming silent again.When he reached Core Formation, the green umbrella was given to him by that person as a gift.Everyone in the whole world knew that Sir Xuan Lingzi, apart from being the most powerful, was also an expert in refining medicine pills, taming beasts, and refining tools. It seemed there was nothing he couldn\u2019t do. The congratulatory gift he gave to his disciple for attaining Core Formation was also a magical tool of the best quality, and could resist an attack from the greatest efforts of a Body Fusion cultivator.Luo Jianqing recalled what his master said at that time. \u201cThis umbrella is a magical tool that consumes. It can block a single attack from a Body Fusion cultivator for you, and then it will be destroyed. If it is not necessary, you must never take it out.\u201dAfter taking the umbrella, Luo Jianqing never used it. He only sometimes gently stroked the umbrella while looking pensive.In his past life, when he was driven out of Tai Hua Mountain, he gave this umbrella to his little junior sister to take it to his master. Even if he was somewhere he could die, he refused to ever take out the umbrella, though now he had come to terms with it.\u201cI won\u2019t use it as a magical tool. It is merely ornamental.\u201dWhen Luo Jianqing had just put away the umbrella, he found that one of the frames had broken off. If he used it many times after that, the umbrella would really be destroyed and become a pile of garbage. Luo Jianqing felt too depressed thinking about this. After he rested in the same place for a short time, he got up to walk towards the stone tablet of the fifth pass.\u201cAn endless wasteland, with countless ferocious beasts!\u201dLike it heard his words, Shuang Fu moved excitedly for a short while in his mind. Luo Jianqing\u2019s lips quirked up. A ray of green sword-light abruptly shot out from his forehead, turning into an iron sword that fell into his palm.\u201cWe must be quick, Shuang Fu.\u201dShuang Fu trembled lightly, like it was answering, \u201cOkay.\u201dIn this broad space, the handsome and bright cultivator narrowed his eyes slightly, gazing at the vast wasteland behind the white screen of light. He held his sword in his right hand, green robe fluttering in the wind. Between his forehead, the scarlet mole burned like fire as if it was about to ignite the entire world.He had to be fast because the remnants assigned difficulty by constitution. Among the seventy-one people, only Li Xiuchen had no constitution, so any barriers he came across would be very easy to pass. Li Xiuchen was bound to reach the end very soon, so he had to scramble ahead of Li Xiuchen and cut off any chance he got!In the next second, Luo Jianqing transformed into a ray of green light, fleeing into the Endless Wasteland, and began to fight hand-to-hand!(1) Bigu diet (\u8f9f\u6996): Daoist fasting technique that avoids eating grainPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 10": "Chapter 10Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBefore entering these remnants, Luo Jianqing hadn\u2019t expected to run into anything dangerous.In that book he obtained, \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d, the whole journey was through Li Xiuchen\u2019s perspective. As everyone knew, Li Xiuchen was the only one out of seventy-one cultivators who had no constitution. Because he used every kind of baffling means possible to raise his cultivation to Qi Condensation, the remnants went very easy on him.For example, in the Endless Wasteland, the strongest demon beasts Li Xiuchen came across was nothing more than rank one or rank two; actually he had only came across one rank two demon beast! But right now, Luo Jianqing had just stepped into the wasteland when he was immediately surrounded by nine rank four blazing beasts.A rank four demon beast was equivalent to a Qi Foundation cultivator!Nine demon beasts suddenly rushing forth like this caught Luo Jianqing by surprise, and he spent a lot of effort killing all of them. However, he still hadn\u2019t put away his sword nor taken a breath when eighteen rank four giant storm snakes surrounded him in every direction!Luo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dThe further he walked through the wasteland, the more fearsome these demon beasts became!To the very end, wave upon wave of eighty-one rank four demon beasts charged into Luo Jianqing simultaneously. The green light on his forehead shone bright as Shuang Fu in his hand let out a clear cry. One man, one sword together formed an illusion, rapidly flitting about between the crowd of beasts. Each blow brought a head dripping with blood. His strikes were fierce and cutting, the results of many years spent practicing at the Wan Shou Mountains.The eighty-one demon beasts, all at the strength of Qi Foundation, were all slain under Shuang Fu.But Luo Jianqing did not relax. His eyebrows furrowed slightly as he looked towards somewhere not far ahead. He could only see a ten zhang tall golden ape with fiery eyes, and walked towards it. It was a rank five demon beast, the same level of strength as early-stage Core Formation!Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes narrowed. In an instant, the sword in his hand flashed and the golden fire-eyed ape\u2019s head tumbled to the ground.Right after that, there was a middle-stage Core Formation golden ape!And a late-stage Core Formation one\u2026 until they reached early-stage Nascent Soul!!!\u201cThis True Lord Beidou is quite remarkable. These definitely aren\u2019t an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator\u2019s remnants!\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s green chang pao danced in the air as he hunted. Sweat was already seeping from his forehead, but he had no fear as he faced against a rank six demon beast who overstepped him by one great boundary, and simply raised his sword as he advanced.Two jade-white fingers kneaded and pinched ceaselessly, forming complicated hand-seals. After a few short breaths, Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand had already formed a virtual image, while Shuang Fu\u2019s brilliance erupted at the same time. Dark clouds quietly gathered in the sky, overstepping the remnants\u2019 enchanted boundaries as it emerged above the Endless Wasteland.The lead-colored clouds rolled as a breeze gradually came to brush against the wasteland, then abruptly started to stir up a storm of sand and rocks.The wind became bigger and bigger, until finally it was whistling and roaring, lifting up Luo Jianqing\u2019s robe. Meanwhile, the dark clouds in the sky oppressively shrouded the wasteland, the air gradually stagnating. The rank six golden fire-eyed ape angrily yelled at Luo Jianqing, rapidly slapping its stomach, then fled.Now\u2019s the moment!Shuang Fu\u2019s green light sprung up everywhere. The sky started to rumble with rolls of thunder. A thick and solid bolt of lightning roared as it struck down from the sky. Luo Jianqing raised his sword and the bolt of lightning struck the stomach of the fire-eyed golden ape, making it howl in pain.\u201cOne Sword Becomes a Nine-Petaled Lotus!\u201dLuo Jianqing tossed his sword in the air, the long sword turning into nine as it directly pierced the body of the fire-eyed golden ape. The ape gave a roar of pain, then collapsed on the ground with a rumble. Its enormous body twitched for a little while, until finally it stopped moving, dying the wasteland red with its blood.Shuang Fu excitedly emitted a sword cry. Like a naughty child, it flew around the sky once before coming back to Luo Jianqing\u2019s side. However, Luo Jianqing\u2019s face had been pale for some time now. He was quietly gasping, his phoenix eyes half-lidded, vigilantly guarding against his surroundings.\u201cOne Sword Becomes a Nine-Petaled Lotus\u201d was one of the True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record\u2019s sword techniques. It was reasonable to say that it could be used upon reaching Nascent Soul. Xuan Lingzi had taught this sword technique very early on to Luo Jianqing. However, until middle-stage Core Formation, Luo Jianqing hadn\u2019t succeeded once. Just now, he had gotten lucky with this killing technique.However, this technique used up all of the spiritual energy in his body. Supposing if a rank two demon beast had showed up suddenly right now, he could probably get critically injured. Luo Jianqing absolutely didn\u2019t regret using the technique, but that golden ape just now was truly too vicious. He had to be the first to move so he could kill his opponent.He also had a general idea that sending out a Nascent Soul level demon beast was too outrageous. In a second, there were no more demon beasts to be seen in the Endless Wasteland. Luo Jianqing recovered a bit of his spiritual energy, then hurriedly opened his storage ring to take out the third-level medicine pill little junior sister had refined herself.This medicine pill was known as the Spirit-Assembling Pill and stored an enormous amount of spiritual energy. Using it recovered a cultivator\u2019s spiritual energy.Luo Jianqing immediately took five pills. Finally he felt the spiritual energy in his body recover by seventy percent.Very soon, he continued to walk forward while holding Shuang Fu. This time, he didn\u2019t run into any abnormal Nascent Soul demon beasts, but he did encounter several late-stage Core Formation demon beasts. Later, the number of demon beasts became greater and greater. Though they were all Core Formation level, they forced Luo Jianqing to have no choice but take out his bamboo umbrella.One hand held an umbrella, while the other held a sword.The umbrella\u2019s exterior made it unapproachable for all of the demon beasts, while the green-clothed cultivator inside slaughtered life ceaselessly. With one raise of a sword-light came a decapitated head.The entire journey, Luo Jianqing\u2019s speed was extremely quick as he searched for Li Xiuchen\u2019s figure.In \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d, it was in this Endless Wasteland that his little junior sister was sent in. Surprisingly, Li Xiuchen came along with her. After all, they came from the same sect. Little junior sister wasn\u2019t the Virgin Mary, but taking care of the new Qi Condensation disciple was something she ought to do. Thus the two walked forwards together.Li Xiuchen was unable to offer little junior sister any help whatsoever, but she carried him all the way until they left the Endless Wasteland.Just when they were about to leave, little junior sister ran into a rank six phantom demon fox!A rank six demon beast was very troublesome. Luo Jianqing had just learned that from experience. What\u2019s more, the phantom demon fox was good at illusion techniques. Little junior sister had exhausted her supply of medicine pills and magical tools to finally critically injure the demon fox, then took Li Xiuchen and left the Endless Wasteland.But little junior sister didn\u2019t know that the phantom demon fox walked behind her and Li Xiuchen and spat out a mouthful of purple demon mist. The demon mist was momentarily undetectable, so little junior sister didn\u2019t notice it. Surprisingly, the demon mist hid inside their bones, and waited until the last pass, Tianshu Star, to suddenly flare up, making the poison of desire to flare up in the two of them as well and caused that kind of stuff to happen.Luo Jianqing\u2019s current notion was very simple. According to common sense, the Endless Wasteland should only have two people in it, him and Li Xiuchen!Although Li Xiuchen\u2019s strength was very weak and he had no constitution, the barriers he came across were very simple, so he passed through quickly. And he had come the entire way by himself, putting all his mental and physical efforts into accelerating his speed, just so he can catch up to him in the Endless Wasteland and kill Li Xiuchen in one blow!No one could say for sure what was going on inside the remnants. It was also very probable that Li Xiuchen was crushing the jade token, but was killed by a demon beast before being sent out. In addition, Li Xiuchen was nothing more than an ordinary disciple. In this world, only the almighty Spirit-Refining Xuan Lingzi was able to look back in time, and even looking back in time might only yield the heavens\u2019 worst false countercharge. Therefore, it was absolutely impossible for anyone to know how Li Xiuchen truly died.\u201cThe Endless Wasteland will be your burial ground!\u201dThe handsome and apathetic green-clothed cultivator sped along rapidly, searching around in the Endless Wasteland. With the bamboo umbrella to defend him against attacks, he traveled back and forth between the demon beasts, completely worry-free. At last! Inside a basin, Luo Jianqing finally spotted Li Xiuchen\u2019s figure!Li Xiuchen was currently facing off against the attacks of two rank one demon beasts.A rank one demon beast\u2019s strength was no more than a Phase One to Three Qi Condensation cultivator\u2019s. He also had no spiritual sense, only being able to rely on pure instinct for combat. This Li Xiuchen was already at Phase Two of Qi Condensation, but surprisingly he could still hold on with such strenuous efforts, which made Luo Jianqing feel nothing but disdain.Seeing that Li Xiuchen was on the verge of killing one of them, Luo Jianqing put away the bamboo umbrella. The corners of his lips pulled up as he raised his sword before thrusting it downwards. To his surprise, just when he was about to seize his sword and prepare to assassinate him, he heard a seductive cry of a beast ringing behind him.An alarm bell immediately sounded in his head, and the hairs all over his body stood up. Being a Core Formation cultivator, his sharp intuition let him hurriedly dodge to the right. A second later, he left a deep imprint that showed where he was before.Luo Jianqing rushed to take out the bamboo umbrella and opened it. But a fluctuating mental attack from the sky directly pierced the umbrella\u2019s defensive enchanted boundaries, aiming towards Luo Jianqing. Luo Jianqing dodged without end, as the mental attacks never ceased.When he flew five li away from the basin, Luo Jianqing quickly put away the bamboo umbrella.\u201cA mental attack!\u201dThe bamboo umbrella could take the entire power of a Body Fusion level attack, but only spiritual attacks, not mental attacks. In this world, there were few cultivators who could use mental attacks. For the most part, mental techniques were an innate skill in demon beasts, almost never seen.Luo Jianqing raised Shuang Fu and watched his surroundings vigilantly, his entire body on guard.Suddenly, he heard alluring and charming laughter from the skies, the sound slightly piercing. The arrival smiled softly. \u201cMy good handsome darling, how can such beautiful skin exist on your filthy, smelly human body? Wouldn\u2019t it be better to peel that leather bag off for me? I\u2019ll spare your life. What do you think?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 11": "Chapter 11Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the wide, smooth wasteland, there were no mountains to be seen, only a bumpy ditch.Luo Jianqing grasped his sword in his right hand, brows tightly locked together, as he looked all around him cautiously. The piercing cries of beasts echoed from every direction, like a monster was following Luo Jianqing. The purple phantom turned into a virtual image, so quick that Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t see it, but he had a rough idea of who the demon beast could be.A rank six demon beast, the phantom demon fox!The fox race had always been intelligent. At rank five and six, they could pour out any kind of human speech.\u201cLittle darling, why don\u2019t you give your servant a smile, hm?\u201d\u201cHuman, why do you still hold your sword? Your servant is confused.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t you follow your servant? Your servant might spare your life.\u201dLaughter like silver bells reverberated all around him. The sound was like a weapon that ruthlessly stabbed into Luo Jianqing\u2019s ears.\u201dGreen Lotus Sword Seal!\u201dLuo Jianqing did not stop changing hand-seals. Shuang Fu rose slowly and transformed into four sharp swords, protecting Luo Jianqing. The four identical swords shook ceaselessly in the air and formed a green barrier. The demon fox\u2019s attacks kept ramming into the barrier.The green curtain of light shook endlessly. The first attack was already hard to resist, and by the second attack it already looked like it was about to fall apart. Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes trembled with fear. He took out a Spirit-Assembling Pill from behind his back and took ten pills at once. Immediately, his spiritual energy sharply increased, the screen of light becoming considerably stronger as well.At the same time, Luo Jianqing watched his surroundings carefully, about to track the trail of the other party.\u201cDarling, if you don\u2019t obey your servant, she will be very hurt.\u201dThe purple figure slowly condensed into form, transforming in front of Luo Jianqing.It was a purple demon fox as tall as a person, its huge purple tail constantly swaying behind its body. Its form wasn\u2019t complete yet, but its eyes were already overflowing with fox charm, fixed on Luo Jianqing\u2019s face. Its blatant gaze roamed over his body, like it was undressing him.\u201cYou humans are always so stupid like this. Since this is the case\u2026\u201d Each word was a powerful mental attack. Luo Jianqing was appalled to find out that even though the other party revealed its body, he was unable to attack, only defend passively. He saw the demon fox close its big mouth and laughed, \u201cSince this is the case, then\u2026 peel off this leather bag of a body for me!\u201dIts voice had just fallen when the demon fox suddenly changed into a purple light, charging towards Luo Jianqing.Luo Jianqing\u2019s phoenix eyes lifted, the side of his mouth evoking a smiling expression. The four swords transformed into one Shuang Fu, appearing in his right hand.\u201cSword Draws Lightning!\u201dSilver lightning rumbled from the sky. The thousand-year lightning crystal inside Shuang Fu pulled all the thunder and lightning from the sky. Luo Jianqing\u2019s right hand slashed through the air, sending thunder towards the phantom demon fox\u2019s body.The demon fox was startled and hurriedly continued downwards, receiving a small wound.\u201cYou child, I\u2019ll make you regret disobeying me!\u201d (1)A demonic light flashed through the demon fox\u2019s eyes and the purple tail suddenly grew larger, striking towards Luo Jianqing in a split second.The silver sword and purple tail battled endlessly in the air. Luo Jianqing continued to struggle against his opponent. The tail became rapid attacks in midair, which he couldn\u2019t react to.Bang! Bang! Bang!It seemed that the demon fox was absolutely terrible at spiritual attacks. Although it had already reached Nascent Soul, the strength of its body was on the same level as Luo Jianqing\u2019s.In a flash, a golden sword-light shone behind Luo Jianqing\u2019s body.The demon fox\u2019s tail was suddenly cut in half, making it howl horribly. Though it didn\u2019t move, a ray of golden light flashed and the demon fox was cut cleanly into two pieces. A white core rolled out from its body.Luo Jianqing\u2019s entire body was frozen stiff, standing in place with disbelief.A neutral voice said behind him, \u201cJianqing.\u201dAfter a while, Luo Jianqing slowly turned around and finally saw that person.With brilliant white clothes and cool, elegant features, a eight-petaled golden lotus sword mark on his forehead, not even the purity of his features was dirtied in this desolate place. He watched him, then slowly stretched his hand towards him. His voice had a hint of urgency as he said, \u201cJianqing, your master has arrived a bit late.\u201dLuo Jianqing could not help grasping his hand in return.The coldness was no different from what he remembered.Luo Jianqing murmured, \u201cMaster\u2026\u201dXuan Lingzi gazed calmly at his disciple. His lips quirked up, revealing a hint of a very light smile. \u201cGood to see that nothing happened to you. That demon fox is Nascent Soul stage. You are much weaker than it. Had your master arrived a second later, you may not be alive right now.\u201dRight after his voice fell, Xuan Lingzi thrust his palm right into Luo Jianqing\u2019s chest.Like a lotus flower, cool air immediately flooded his nostrils. Luo Jianqing was seized with terror from this feeling in his chest, and heard a low voice mutter into his ear, \u201cJianqing, if you need me for something, it would be good to let your master know.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s fingers shook slightly. He couldn\u2019t help but embrace the other tightly, greedily sucking in the familiar scent of his chest. He heard the other person said quietly, \u201cThese remnants are truly unusual. Today your master will first bring you out, then Tai Hua Mountain will come and carefully examine it. After that, we might find out what kind of mishap occurred here. Jianqing, your master will not permit you to do something so dangerous again. When we get back, you will remain at Tai Hua Mountain and concentrate on cultivating. This\u2026 ngh, you\u2026\u201dShuang Fu stuck out from Xuan Lingzi\u2019s stomach, without a drop of blood on the blade.In a flash, the entire world changed, and the Xuan Lingzi just then transformed into a demon fox. The purple demon fox spat out blood, its paw already on Luo Jianqing\u2019s back, only three inches away from pulling out his heart!The demon fox said in disbelief, \u201cWhy?\u2026 My illusion comes from what you humans desire the most. Your cultivation is lower than mine, it would be impossible for you to realize\u2026 why\u2026\u201dHis elegant and calm face without any trace of expression, Luo Jianqing emotionlessly pulled out his sword. He thrust his left hand inside the demon fox\u2019s dantian and pulled out the purple core.\u201cYou ask why I could see through your illusion?\u201d His left hand still sticking out from the demon fox\u2019s body, Luo Jianqing lowered his head with a tranquil expression, and said neutrally, \u201cBecause that person would never say those kinds of words to me. If I died, he would still stand at his Yu Xiao Peak. He wouldn\u2019t show a fraction of sentiment for me.\u201dLuo Jianqing took out the purple core. The demon fox trembled with hatred as it spit out a final purple breath of demon mist, then looked at Luo Jianqing\u2019s resisting sword, Shuang Fu, who was brimming with lightning as it blocked the demon mist out of Luo Jianqing\u2019s body.\u201cWhat I did to little junior sister before, I won\u2019t do again. Since you\u2019ve delivered yourself to me, then use your life to apologize to little junior sister in my past life.\u201dWith unwillingness and remorse, the demon fox gradually fell down.The rank six phantom demon fox\u2019s corpse was also quite valuable as the fur on its body could be used to make a magical tool. Luo Jianqing put the demon fox\u2019s corpse inside his storage ring with a wave of his sleeve. He carefully observed the purple demon core. Purple light was circulating around its surface, faintly reflecting a sort of sinister feeling. Luo JIanqing thought to himself that this was a bit strange, but finally put the demon core in his storage ring.\u201cIf you weren\u2019t so impatient for victory and battled with me for a moment longer, I\u2019d be unable to resist you.\u201dLooking at the pool of bloodstains on the ground, Luo Jianqing was not at all reluctant to lift his head. He pulled up his sword and left. Though he had just gone through a life-threatening aerial battle and still haven\u2019t regained his strength, he still had enough to fight a Phase Two Qi Condensation boy and more.When Luo Jianqing flew back to the basin, Li Xiuchen had just sat on a large stone, panting. It seemed that he had killed those two demon beasts just now and didn\u2019t notice Luo Jianqing\u2019s arrival.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t give him a moment to rest. Without saying anything, a green sword light flew down rapidly, aiming straight for Li Xiuchen\u2019s head!A Core Formation cultivator\u2019s breath was absolutely not anything Li Xiuchen could sense. He remained resting on the large stone, still not noticing the earth-level sword coming right towards his head. However! Right when it was about to pierce through Li Xiuchen\u2019s skull, he suddenly shifted to the side a little bit.\u201cAhhhh! It hurts!\u201dShuang Fu had skewered through Li Xiuchen\u2019s left shoulder to his arm, narrowly destroying his hand!Luo Jianqing\u2019s pupils shrunk, and instantly understood why.\u201cThe will of the heavens!\u201dThe wrath-filled voice made Li Xiuchen turn his head and see Luo Jianqing, startling him, then hurriedly moved towards the side to dodge. This time he could not attend to the unbearable pain in his arm, and he said urgently, \u201cWhat\u2026 what are you doing? Do you want to kill me?!\u201dLuo Jianqing didn\u2019t answer. Shuang Fu turned into a ray of green light and returned to his right hand. With a handsome face as cold as snow, his completely emotionless gaze fell on Li Xiuchen, like he was looking at something that was not a living being.Suddenly, Li Xiuchen understood. \u201cYou want to kill me and replace me as the main character? Luo Jianqing, that\u2019s impossible! I am the main character, you put down your sword right now and leave with me. I guarantee that you and I can become immortal together! I won\u2019t kill you, I won\u2019t kill you in the future okay!\u201dLuo Jianqing didn\u2019t acknowledge him, the ray of sword-light flying rapidly towards Li Xiuchen\u2019s stomach.Li Xiuchen ran ahead and never stopped, but he couldn\u2019t run anywhere that Shuang Fu couldn\u2019t get to in a flash. In a very short time, the tip of the sword was about to pierce Li Xiuchen\u2019s stomach. Yet Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t relax and took two fingers together, three rays of sword-light springing up from his fingertips to block Li Xiuchen from the other three directions.Shuang Fu\u2019s tip had already impaled through Li Xiuchen\u2019s clothes.Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes widened, waiting for that moment to arrive.Until\u2026 the world rumbled loudly, and white light flooded everything. When Luo Jianqing opened his eyes again, Li Xiuchen had disappeared from the Endless Wasteland. Luo Jianqing stared dumbly at this scene. After a very long time, he clenched his right hand and took back Shuang Fu, pointing it towards the blue sky in resentment.\u201cThe will of the heavens!\u201dIn the next moment, a white light flickered in front of Luo Jianqing\u2019s body, and the Endless Wasteland no longer held his shadow.Everything around him was darkness. Luo Jianqing looked so gloomy that it looked like a drop of water was about to leak, Shuang Fu grasped tightly in his hand. He couldn\u2019t make out anything in his surroundings because he had been transported to the sixth pass\u2014Tianxuan Pass.\u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d had said that this pass was the easiest to cross. All he needed to do was to stand in place for a moment, and he would cross.In the endless chaos, Luo Jianqing heard an indistinct and hoarse voice. This voice was like rough sandstone and repeated three words over and over, never-ending, like it never got tired.\u201cHuman or demon\u2026\u201d\u201cHuman or demon\u2026\u201d\u201cHuman or demon\u2026\u201dThere was no other voice, but it was mixed with a tinge of something ancient, echoing endlessly in this space. Luo Jianqing\u2019s face was calm, and didn\u2019t take notice of the voice, until it suddenly stopped somewhere not far from him, and said one sentence in a low voice, \u201cYou are human.\u201dLuo Jianqing immediately brandished his sword, but only cut through empty air.Yes, Li Xiuchen was human, so he was transported to the seventh pass.\u201cHuman or demon, human or demon, human or demon\u2026\u201dThe voice slowly came towards Luo Jianqing. At this very moment, his anger had even cooled down a bit. Luo Jianqing calmly took out Shuang Fu and waited for the pass to test him. When it finally arrived near him, he seemed to feel a faint presence stop in front of him. The voice whispered, \u201cHuman\u2026 or demon\u2026\u201dThe voice stopped spontaneously. After a moment, it suddenly said in a sharp voice, \u201cYou are a demon!\u201d(1) \u656c\u9152\u4e0d\u5403\u5403\u7f5a\u9152: The actual phrase was this. CCdict\u2019s definition is to \u201cto refuse a toast only to be forced to drink a forfeit; fig. to hesitate to do sth until forced to do even more\u201d. Here\u2019s a more extensive explanation. I obviously had no way of putting this comfortably in there lol\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 12": "Chapter 12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe voice had just fallen when a strong and solid attack of spiritual energy came towards Luo Jianqing.When he heard \u201cyou are a demon\u201d, Luo Jianqing, pupils shrunken, simultaneously took out the bamboo umbrella from his storage ring out of reflex. The surging, vast spiritual energy attacked the bamboo umbrella and suddenly broke off a frame!In response, an alarm bell erupted in Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart and immediately drew his sword to meet the enemy.In the hazy and lightless chaos, Luo Jianqing shut his eyes, listening attentively, and raised his sword to face the attacks that came from every direction. The other\u2019s attacks all struck against the bamboo umbrella, while Luo Jianqing\u2019s attacks fell in the vast empty void, not able to land a single hit.Bang! Bang! Bang!Although these attacks weren\u2019t as daring as the first time, like when it immediately broke off a frame from the bamboo umbrella, it was able to break off a frame within ten strikes. Even if Luo Jianqing wasn\u2019t emotionally attached to this umbrella, he knew that the next time it happened, sooner or later he would meet his end by the hands of the other party.At the very least, this kind of attack was of a late-stage Nascent Soul expert\u2019s. Even late-stage would be perfect at this point!Mind working rapidly, Luo Jianqing fought back with difficulty while thinking about what exactly was going on at the same time. He didn\u2019t believe for a second that he could be a demon. Since ancient times, demons and humans have never lived side by side. If even the Spirit-Refining Sir Xuan Lingzi saw that he was a demon and still accepted him as his disciple, it was impossible for anyone in these remnants to perceive him as a demon.How did such a problem come about\u2026\u201cThe demon core?!\u201dLuo Jianqing firmly grasped his umbrella while ignoring the other\u2019s attacks, and yelled loudly, \u201cElder! This one is definitely not a demon!\u201dHis voice had a thread of spiritual energy mixed in it, making it resound into the distance and finally stop the attacks. Then he heard the voice, as hoarse and unpleasant as before, croak, \u201cDemon, demon, demon\u2026 \u201cLuo Jianqing turned his hand to take out the purple demon core from his storage ring, and said respectfully, \u201cSenior, this one had just taken this demon core from a rank six demon beast in the Endless Wasteland. In reality, this one had previously slain countless demons and even took their cores. Isn\u2019t this just a misunderstanding?\u201dThe chaos was silent for a moment, and Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart gradually relaxed, but unexpectedly, the voice abruptly screeched in an ear-piercing tone, \u201cYou are a demon! You are a demon! You are a demon!\u201dAnother earth-shattering attack came towards Luo Jianqing. Even if Luo Jianqing\u2019s bamboo umbrella could withstand these attacks, in the end, he didn\u2019t know where the enemy was, so there was no way to attack. Luo Jianqing only felt that the voice was too unreasonable. Why did it come to the conclusion that he was a demon? If he was, then wasn\u2019t every honored senior and elder at Tai Hua Peak playing a prank on him?Soon, another one of the bamboo umbrella\u2019s frames had broken off. Luo Jianqing grit his teeth and tossed the umbrella in midair. Gentle golden light spilled from the umbrella\u2019s surface, wrapping Luo Jianqing inside.Luo Jianqing\u2019s fingers, which held Shuang Fu, had several points on them as the sword slowly flew away from his palm, its tip facing straight outwards. Luo Jianqing rapidly formed hand seals, green rays of light flickering between his two hands like little stars. Shuang Fu\u2019s radiance was even more dazzling.Above the chaos, there seemed to be a faint sound of thunder.Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand seal forming speed became even faster and Shuang Fu spun rapidly, waiting for the enemy\u2019s attack. But at that moment, the green light between his hands seemed to darken to some degree. Luo Jianqing did not hesitate to stamp his right foot on the ground, and a mouthful of hot blood spurted on Shuang Fu.Suddenly! There was a burst of green light!Luo Jianqing, still forming hand seals, had a trail of blood flowing from his lips.\u201cOne Sword Becomes a Nine-Petaled Lotus!\u201dThe sword fluctuated and became nine, flying forward swiftly. Shuang Fu had already become a virtual image, while thunder rolled from the highest heavens like the sound of drums and lightning struck down. This was because of the ten thousand-year old iron and the thousand-year old lightning crystal that was cast to make Shuang Fu. Luo Jianqing was able to use One Sword Becomes a Nine-Petaled Lotus twice in one day, but at this moment his spiritual energy was going to dry up early, so he was forced to rely on the bamboo umbrella to protect himself.Purple lightning flooded the entire space. Like silver snakes, it wriggled wildly. The nine swords couldn\u2019t find a target to attack, so they turned into a sword formation, sweeping every inch of space with an unstoppable force.Luo Jianqing was already out of options. If he truly couldn\u2019t cross this mountain pass, he had no choice but to break the jade token and evacuate out of the remnants.Luo Jianqing\u2019s right hand covered his stomah, having used up so much of his spiritual energy. Unfortunately, he ran out of Spirit-Assembling Pills when he was fighting off the phantom demon fox. As a result, looking at Shuang Fu attacking blindly, Luo Jianqing could only smile bitterly. \u201cCould it be\u2026 that I will truly stop here?\u201dA moment later, a white light shone on Luo Jianqing\u2019s body. When he opened his eyes, he was in a stone room!Luo Jianqing stood dumbly in the same spot. His first reaction was to inspect where Shuang Fu fell. When he sensed the sword dancing happily in his mind, Luo Jianqing finally let out a sigh of relief. He raised his line of sight and was suddenly startled.Li Xiuchen also stood dumbly as he watched the battered Luo Jianqing.The two stared at each other like this, at a loss at what to do, for a short period of time. Then Luo Jianqing gathered two fingers together, a green sword-light solidifying at his fingertips.Li Xiuchen had just kneeled on the praying mat when he saw Luo Jianqing do this. In response, he immediately got up and said urgently, \u201cDo you\u2026 do you really want to kill me? We both came from the same place. We are both fellow townsmen! I promise that I won\u2019t kill you in the future. I can\u2019t even kill you anyway, please spare me!\u201dLuo Jianqing narrowed his eyes, his sword-light still heading forwards.Li Xiuchen continued, \u201cI won\u2019t compete with you. I\u2019ll give you the main character role, okay! You know that the seventh pass\u2019 prize is gone now. I won\u2019t pass it on, I don\u2019t want treasure either. I\u2019ll let you have everything I own. I can be your little brother. Everything I have will be yours.\u201dAt this moment, Luo Jianqing already walked in front of Li Xiuchen. His lips turned up coldly. This kind of look suddenly brought to mind of that time when he used that expression to look at himself at Duan Qing Cliff.At that time, Li Xiuchen said, \u201cSenior brother Luo, today will be the last time I call you senior brother. Having fallen to demonic cultivation, even injuring second senior brother and sixth senior brother, it is almost as if the heavens will not tolerate you betraying everyone so rashly. Today, you seem like you\u2019re ready to die at Duan Qing Cliff. For the sake of the camaraderie between martial brothers in those days, I might ask everyone to spare you and leave your corpse intact.\u201dThat Li Xiuchen was so flamboyant and reckless. This Li Xiuchen, however, was as insignificant as an ant.Li Xiuchen\u2019s tears and snot flowing down his face and that pleading expression made Luo Jianqing feel disgusted, but he was also unwilling to waste any more time. His frigid sword-light slowly rose to face Li Xiuchen directly, whose face had gone pale long ago.This time, Luo Jianqing took the bamboo umbrella to block himself from any external attacks.He looked at Li Xiuchen in front of him with an apathetic gaze. Then he unhurriedly raised his fingers, but suddenly heard a bell-like voice echoing in his mind. \u201cHee hee hee hee, you humans still slaughter each other? Little darling, you\u2019re so corrupt, but your servant likes it. It would be truly better to\u2026 give yourself to your servant, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s eyes widened, and a sharp, piercing pain went through his mind.\u201cAh!!!\u201dIt was so painful that he covered one side of his head. Li Xiuchen took advantage of this and ran to a corner.The purple demon core flew out of Luo Jianqing\u2019s storage ring, purple demon mist diffusing into the air. Soon, the green-clothed cultivator was trapped inside it. Li Xiuchen watched the scene, utterly stupefied and not understanding what was going on.He naturally didn\u2019t understand what kind of pain Luo Jianqing was going through at this moment.In his mind, Shuang Fu let out a cry of concern and fear as a ball of white light confronted the purple demon mist intruder. Luo Jianqing rolled around on the ground in suffering, dust dirtying his green robe, his hair dishevelled. One eye remained clear, while the other was already bordered with purple.\u201cLittle darling, don\u2019t struggle. Right now, your body\u2019s like a lamp all out of oil. It would be best to obey your servant.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t even think about it!\u201d\u201cLittle darling, there is no need to show off again.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dHis unmatched handsome face was soaked with sweat. Luo Jianqing was holding his head in pain, blood flowing from his purple eyes.No one knew how long it had been. Li Xiuchen had been hiding off to the side, watching and listening to Luo Jianqing cry out in pain inside the purple demon mist. He waited for ages and ages, even when he heard Luo Jianqing sobbing. Then Li Xiuchen suddenly saw the purple mist disperse considerably, but he still hid in the corner, not daring to budge.Until he heard a low and ambiguous groan.That sound was too alluring. Li Xiuchen\u2019s entire body was rigid, then he walked over in curiosity.In the hazy purple mist, he could only see a handsome and elegant young man leaning against the wall, gasping roughly. His phoenix eyes were bright and beautiful, his lips red with dripping blood, so indescribably gorgeous.Li Xiuchen felt chills run down his spine.As the arrogance of being the great senior brother of Tai Hua Mountain and a Core Formation cultivator had faded away completely, that beauty that was unique only to Luo Jianqing blossomed fully. Li Xiuchen had always known that Luo Jianqing was definitely the most attractive character in \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d. Even though he would later marry a mermaid princess, he was afraid that he couldn\u2019t compare with this villain.In the past, Li Xiuchen never really paid attention to Luo Jianqing\u2019s appearance because his aura was too powerful. Even at this moment, he couldn\u2019t withstand this person\u2019s strength. But now, Luo Jianqing was collapsed inside the purple mist, powerless. His black hair was scattered across his green clothes as he stared ahead with rippling eyes and pink cheeks.At this moment, Li Xiuchen finally understood this was what they called beauty that was neither male nor female!Li Xiuchen\u2019s fingers gradually began to tremble. He stepped forward without thinking, wanting to have a better look. He hadn\u2019t moved, but he was thinking that this purple mist resembled something in his memory when suddenly, it dispelled towards him. Li Xiuchen felt this purple mist was unusually familiar, but he couldn\u2019t think of how.He heard Luo Jianqing shout himself hoarse, \u201cNo!!!\u201dPerplexed, Li Xiuchen looked towards Luo Jianqing and saw that his eyes were wide open in rage, eyes already bloodshot as he looked at him and the purple mist in pain. Just as he began to waver, Li Xiuchen suddenly felt his entire body heat up, spreading from his thighs to the rest of his body below.There was a sound of an explosion, like his rationality had burned to cinders.Li Xiuchen panted hoarsely, his body trembling as he looked at the beautiful cultivator who was reclining.Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes was unable to open any further, but even his wrathful expression could not weaken his beauty. A drop of sweat fell down from Luo Jianqing\u2019s pale forehead, rolled down a line to his jaw, and finally down inside his clothes.Li Xiuchen couldn\u2019t help swallowing his spit, whispering hoarsely, \u201cSo pretty\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing turned his hand to form a burst of sword-light, sending it flying towards Li Xiuchen. Surprisingly, the sword-light was only slightly crooked and left a trace of blood on Li Xiuchen\u2019s face, then finally hit the wall.\u201cThe heavenly will!!!\u201dLuo Jianqing shuddered and suppressed his body\u2019s strongest desires, wishing he could flee to Yu Xiao Peak.Just now, when the demon fox had taken advantage of his spiritual energy being used up, it unexpectedly sought to possess his body. During that difficult struggle, Luo Jianqing nearly died killing the demon fox\u2019s consciousness. At the same time, he was suffering from the demon core\u2019s poison of desire. However, Luo Jianqing never would\u2019ve guessed that the demon fox, even at death\u2019s door, suddenly steered that demon mist towards Li Xiuchen who was in the same space as him.As the demon fox was dying, it seemed to echo in his ear, \u201cFilthy, vile human! Have a taste of what it feels like to be a woman under a man\u2019s body!\u201dThe sword-light just now was already Luo Jianqing\u2019s final move. His entire body\u2019s supply of spiritual energy had been exhausted, which was not something that could be recovered in an hour. Right now, even the effort used to open his eyes stirred up the poison of desire, not to mention other things.If the poison of desire inside the demon mist trapped even his Core Formation little junior sister, then the demon core\u2019s poison would already make it difficult for a Body Fusion cultivator to control themselves.At this moment, Luo Jianqing had already been madly swallowed up by his desires for a while now. His body was screaming for someone\u2019s touch, but his barely existing rationale made him only look on helplessly as Li Xiuchen walked towards him step by step, undoing his belt. His eyes went back and forth between his face and body, then slowly lowered his head.\u201cLi Xiuchen\u2026 I must kill you, in this life\u2026 I will definitely kill you!\u201dA trail of blood seeped from his lips as Luo Jianqing spoke those words with his utmost effort. Every time he spoke, more blood filled his mouth.Li Xiuchen didn\u2019t hear any of his words. His avaricious gaze lingered on that beautiful face and finally, that red mole on his forehead. The redness seemed to ignite, making Li Xiuchen look at it for a very long time. After a short period of time, he couldn\u2019t help but lower his head, wanting to kiss his full lips.Humiliation and resentment emerged one after another on Luo Jianqing\u2019s face. He could already feel Li Xiuchen\u2019s vile breath. His two eyes were at its widest, unwilling to close them, as he wanted to remember this moment forever, remember when this person brought dishonor to him, so he would return it ten-fold in the future!There was less than an inch\u2019s distance between their lips. Li Xiuchen\u2019s breath sprayed on his alluring face.But in an instant, a golden light erupted.Bang!Li Xiuchen was kicked to the wall. A cold voice, mixed with hard-to-ignore anger and anxiety, echoed loudly in the narrow stone room, like something holy. \u201cIf you dare take another step, I will cut your body into thousands of pieces, and I will not hesitate to do it here!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 13": "Chapter 13Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRumbling echoed in the stone room.Li Xiuchen\u2019s body hit the wall, along with the flying rubble. The wall didn\u2019t stop him at all, but he was beside himself with pain. Every bone in his body seemed to be pulverized from head to foot. His ribs were at the very least, broken in four places. If he was an ordinary person, he would probably be dead by now.Not only that, but the powerful oppressive aura kept Li Xiuchen\u2019s feet firmly rooted to the ground, making him unable to budge.At this moment, screaming desire still boiled inside Li Xiuchen\u2019s chest, but he didn\u2019t care about that anymore. He struggled to lift his head and finally saw clearly who the arrival was.The person\u2019s body was handsome and graceful in his white changpao. His black hair was brilliant, and there was a golden light that was faintly discernible around his entire body. The eight-petaled golden lotus on his forehead blossomed into countless rays of lights, burning so brightly no one could look directly at it.Li Xiuchen\u2019s teeth trembled. He had already known who this person was, but all along he did not dare believe why he showed up here.Xuan Lingzi coldly regarded the sorry-looking Li Xiuchen on the ground without any trace of sadness nor joy, or even the wrath he had just displayed. Instead, he looked at Li Xiuchen like he wasn\u2019t a living thing, making the latter tremble and only wish to move, as this person could kill him without the slightest hesitation.\u201cJust now, did you use those two hands to touch my disciple\u2019s clothes?\u201dHis low and cold voice resounded calmly.For a while now, Li Xiuchen was aching as well as suffering from the poison of desire, so much that he could not utter a word, so naturally there was no reply.However, Xuan Lingzi had no desire to hear his answer and only raised his hand apathetically. In an instant, a golden sword-light flashed and the spiritual energy directly burst through Li Xiuchen\u2019s palms!\u201cAhh!!!\u201dLi Xiuchen\u2019s eyes were leaking tears out of pain, mucus also overflowing down his face. He looked at the aloof honored senior in front of him with fright. The other person said indifferently, \u201cJust now, did you use those two eyes to look at my disciple\u2019s body?\u201d\u201cAhhh!!!\u201dTears of pain flowed from Li Xiuchen\u2019s eyes. Even the dark thunder roaring fiercely in the skies above could not stop Xuan Lingzi\u2019s movements. Xuan Lingzi pressed two fingers together, the golden sword-light still flowing between them. His narrow phoenix eyes stared quietly at his utterly defeated body.Xuan Lingzi said, \u201cJust now, did you, Li Xiuchen, want to fight my disciple again?\u201dThe sword-light between Xuan Lingzi\u2019s fingers erupted. He narrowed his eyes and pointed his fingers at Li Xiuchen. At this moment, Li Xiuchen\u2019s eyes were closed as he rolled about in agony. He could not understand why this person, who should\u2019ve been his master, would suddenly want to kill him, even so much that every word he spoke dripped with hatred.He watched as that sword-light was about to meet his body, while the sound of thunder in the skies grew even fiercer. In an instant, a silver bolt of lightning rumbled from the sky as it cleaved the air, and struck towards Xuan Lingzi!The level of this lightning was not something that Luo Jianqing could summon before. It was so thick that it surpassed the size of the stone room, and silver snakes swam around it. Such lightning made people think of a frightening thought \u2013 that it was a lightning tribulation (1) that could wipe out an almighty Calamity Passage cultivator!After the bolt of silver lightning came down, Xuan Lingzi raised his hand to block it.And after that, there was a bolt of red lightning that looked like it could topple the heavens and wipe out the earth!No more than thirty-six reckless bolts of lightning struck down. Even though Xuan Lingzi\u2019s face became gradually paler, he again turned his hand to block a bolt of purple lightning. Storm clouds rolled in the skies, like another lightning tribulation was going to drop. However, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s pupils shrunk as he said angrily, \u201cI\u2019ve already given up to this degree, do you really think you can stop me?!\u201dThe storm clouds were silent for a moment, but lingered and did not disperse. They continued to spiral around the skies of the remnants.The dense, dark clouds could be seen from anywhere in the 300 li of the Yi Tian Mountains. Countless ordinary people crouched on the ground, praying endlessly as they begged the heavens not to punish them. And in Yi Tian Sect, three Core Formation honored elders were all present, looking at the storm clouds that were spreading over hundreds of li with astonishment.The second elder said, alarmed, \u201cIs an almighty Calamity Passage cultivator going through a lightning tribulation?\u201dThe great elder shook his head. \u201cEven if it was Sir Xuan Lingzi of those days, it was said that he had only come across storm clouds that spanned across 811 li, and eighty-one lightning tribulations. In this world, is there still anyone that can surpass Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s honored senior? It must be a holy vision that the demon realm will riot!\u201dThe third elder suddenly remembered, \u201cSenior brother, could it be True Lord Beidou\u2019s remnants\u2026\u201d\u201cNonsense! They are nothing more than a Nascent Soul\u2019s remnants. How could it trigger this kind of vision?\u201dFor a moment, ordinary people everywhere kneeled on the ground and prayed, while countless cultivators never stopped talking.And inside those remnants, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s emotionless and handsome face was unchanging as he silently raised his head to look at the skies. His sword-light did not stop until the very end. He raised a foot to kick Li Xiuchen to the corner, then reached out and extracted a white light from his forehead.\u201cForget what happened. I will spare your life today.\u201dHis face pained, Li Xiuchen struggled for another moment, then finally lost consciousness. His face was deep red. The poison of desire had already transformed into a purple thread of demon mist, incessantly scattering inside his body. But he did not wake, no matter how much the poison wrecked his body.Xuan Lingzi, no longer paying attention to that person, turned around and looked towards his disciple coolly, but when he caught sight of the other person, he suddenly startled.\u201cJianqing!\u201dXuan Lingzi hurried forward and took Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand, sending pure spiritual energy to him.Luo Jianqing\u2019s cheeks were flushed, and he had been breathing heavily for a while. When he received spiritual energy all of a sudden, he suddenly had the strength to move. As a result the poison of desire in his body he had been suppressing all along, immediately took over that refreshing source and he flipped over the other person, pressing him down.Xuan Lingzi stared blankly at this scene.Luo Jianqing sat on top of his body, his eyes drooping as he looked at him with blurry vision.Those lips that called out \u201cMaster\u201d in the past were now red with dripping blood, an alluring red. His beautiful eyes were shining with liquid, clothes in a disorderly mess, and his pretty, frail collarbone was exposed.Luo Jianqing slowly opened his eyes, looking at the person he was pressing down. When he saw his face, he was not surprised in the least. He only laughed hoarsely and murmured in a low voice, \u201cIs this\u2026 another illusion? Illusion, illusion\u2026 mn\u2026\u201dA low and vague groan came from his throat. Luo Jianqing restrained himself and slowly looked down at his body, moving closer to the face of the person below him. With a complicated look, he gazed at his face, his line of sight moving from his indifferent eyes all the way to his thin lips. Finally, he suddenly lowered his head and kissed him.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s eyes shrunk.Luo Jianqing\u2019s warm, moist breath pressed up to the other person. He closed his eyes and sincerely kissed the person below him. Their lips rubbed against each other, gently nipping and licking. Originally he wanted to pry open the other\u2019s teeth, but surprisingly the other person tightly locked his jaws, refusing to open even an inch.They kissed for ages. Luo Jianqing raised his head and looked at the noble Sir Xuan Lingzi, whose facial expression still hadn\u2019t changed as he looked at him indifferently. Only his red, swollen lips revealed what had happened earlier.Luo Jianqing was not angry or humiliated at all. His master ought to be like this forever, unable to move for him.The peerless, exceptional great senior brother of Tai Hua Mountain laughed lowly. He seemed to be laughing yet crying at the same time. He had been restraining the poison of desire in his body up until the very end. He rubbed at his own clothes, handling his lust himself. His lower body had been as hard as iron, pressing rigidly against Xuan Lingzi\u2019s stomach. Yet he still remained entangling himself, refusing to take the initiative.Earlier, Luo Jianqing\u2019s belt had been pulled off by Li Xiuchen. But now, after he tore it off, his clothes were dishevelled, exposing much of his snow-white skin to the open air. His entire skin was a faint shade of pink, resembling the most beautiful white jade on earth, so beautiful that it could take one\u2019s breath away.Luo Jianqing sat on top of Xuan Lingzi\u2019s body, unable to control himself as he fondled his own body.He didn\u2019t notice the eyes of the person below him getting darker and darker, darker and darker. Xuan Lingzi watched Luo Jianqing caressing his own chest for two minutes. His eyes narrowed and he suddenly turned over, pressing Luo Jianqing under his body. He looked at his disciple with a complicated look. After a long time, he finally pulled Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand.Luo Jianqing looked at him blankly, eyes filled with lust.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s expression was tranquil as he quietly looked at his lower body. His ice-cold lips were boiling hot on his body, kissing every inch of his skin. Finally, he stopped at Luo Jianqing\u2019s left shoulder. He kissed him delicately, sucking until it left behind an alluring red. At last, he raised his head and looked at his disciple, trapped in lust and unable to free himself.When Xuan Lingzi moved, Luo Jianqing was panting ceaselessly. He looked at him with watery eyes, a slight pain in his voice as he murmured, \u201cMaster, heh heh, Master\u2026 oh\u2026\u201dHot lips pressed down, sealing whatever words Luo Jianqing would\u2019ve said next.His cold tongue broke past his burning lips, lapping at every inch of scalding skin in his mouth, sucking his full lips with smacks. Luo Jianqing involuntarily let out a moan. He passionately embraced the person above him, bringing him close, wishing the other person would stroke and caress him.But Xuan Lingzi was not only kissing him.They kissed greedily and wantonly, as if the feelings that were repressed for so many years were all set free. He bit and nibbled at those soft lips, lapping at those sweet fluids, making his serious and restrained disciple cry out unbearably.Xuan Lingzi caressed Luo Jianqing\u2019s hair and pulled out the green jade hairpin. In a flash, three thousand strands of black hair fanned out. The black hair in the middle of his heart-stirringly beautiful face was especially alluring. Xuan Lingzi looked down at this scene, then kissed him even more tenderly.He softly kissed him for a very long time, then finally stopped.Luo Jianqing shuddered as he held him, bringing his bare chest close. But Xuan Lingzi\u2019s gaze was still peaceful, not moved in the slightest.After a short period of time, Xuan Lingzi lowered his head and kissed those lips again. This time, a pale red light shone where his lips pressed. Luo Jianqing\u2019s entire body was rigid, laying limp on the stone to let the other kiss him. The red light became brighter and brighter. After some time had passed, the heat on Luo Jianqing\u2019s skin gradually faded away, and his fair skin returned to its jade-white color.The truth was that the flickering red light was between Xuan Lingzi\u2019s forehead. By the time the red light between the two people\u2019s lips disappeared, Xuan Lingzi immediately released Luo Jianqing. As if he didn\u2019t want to wait a second longer, he placed his sleeping disciple on the ground after taking care of that poison of desire inside him.Xuan Lingzi tidied up his clothes. Noble and cold, not a single hair out of place, like nothing had ever happened. He conscientiously put every single article of clothing back on Luo Jianqing, his expression cold as if he was really merely taking care of his own disciple, without any other kind of affection.After everything was done, he slowly got up and looked at the praying mat of the stone room.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s eyes narrowed, and said in an ice-cold voice, \u201cSince you have already watched us for so long, why are you still hiding? You disgrace my disciple\u2019s honor, slander him and call him a demon, setting up that demon fox to possess his body \u2013 you best prepare to properly apologize!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 14": "Chapter 14Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXuan Lingzi\u2019s voice fell, leaving only silence in the stone room.He gathered two fingers together and a golden sword-light broke the stone table in front of the praying mat. Immediately, a wobbling remnant soul appeared from the stone table. His body was very faint like it would break in the next second, but the words \u201chuman or demon\u201d still repeated endlessly from his lips.If Luo Jianqing woke at this very moment, he was afraid that he would immediately discover that this voice was the very thing he had been struggling against for so long while trying to cross the sixth pass. This was merely a remnant soul, and it can even be said that this remnant soul had little spiritual sense. However, he\u2019d been containing the original master\u2019s obsession, and hadn\u2019t dispersed for a very long time.\u201cHuman or demon, human or demon\u2026\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s cold face had no emotion as the golden eight-petaled lotus on his forehead abruptly blossomed into innumerable rays of light. The remnant soul howled painfully, shuddering as he raised his head to look at him. After looking at him up and down for a very long time, he exclaimed sharply, \u201cYou are a demon!\u201dXuan Lingzi snorted lightly and sneered. \u201cIn what way am I a demon?\u201dAs if the voice didn\u2019t hear him at all, he ferociously pounced towards Xuan Lingzi.Xuan Lingzi raised his sword-light, and the remnant soul started to howl miserably. His eyes gradually became clearer and brighter. After a while, he raised his head to look at Xuan Lingzi, and asked in astonishment, \u201cA Nascent Soul?!\u201d After a moment, the remnant soul said in fright, \u201cHalf a Nascent Soul\u2026 you are a cultivator higher than the Mahayana stage!Xuan Lingzi did not take note of the remnant soul\u2019s words at all. With an indifference like a frozen lotus, he said neutrally, \u201cYou have already recovered your consciousness. Now apologize for wrongly accusing my disciple of being a demon.\u201dNot waiting for the other person to attack, the remnant soul shrieked hoarsely, \u201cHe\u2019s a demon, he\u2019s a demon, he\u2019s a demon!\u201dXuan Lingzi sneered. \u201cWhat nonsense!\u201dThe remnant soul shuddered as he spoke. \u201cHe is not tolerated by the heavens\u2019 81 Greater Daos and 3,000 Lesser Daos. If he isn\u2019t a demon, then what is he!\u201d\u201cSo cultivators that are not tolerated by the heavenly will are demons?\u201d\u201cYes!\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s chang pao swung, a bit of golden light falling in the stone room. He asked calmly, \u201cThen, am I one?\u201dThe remnant soul was suddenly speechless. In a flash, he seemed to turn insane again, and began to repeat endlessly, \u201cA Mahayana stage demonic cultivator, a Mahayana stage demonic cultivator, a demon master, you are a demon master\u2026 you are a demon, you are a demon, you are a demon!\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s phoenix eyes fell on this mad remnant soul for a moment. He watched on indifferently as the remnant soul held his head in agony. According to the remnant soul\u2019s nature, he would begin to attack him, but whenever he raised his head to look at him, he timidly returned his line of sight.Until the very end, the remnant soul flew up slowly, repeatedly hitting the ceiling of the stone room. He had absolutely no physical body, only screaming \u201cdemon master\u201d and \u201chuman or demon\u201d, all the while incessantly abusing himself in this manner.At this, Xuan Lingzi only watched quietly. Even though the remnant soul knocked into Li Xiuchen\u2019s body, making the unconscious Li Xiuchen shudder, he never stopped him. When the remnant soul was just about to hit Luo Jianqing\u2019s body, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s eyes finally shrunk and swept the remnant soul back, with a flick of his sleeve.The almighty Spirit-Refining cultivator\u2019s voice echoed like thunder in the narrow stone room.\u201cYou are already dead, and yet you continue with this obsession? Since ancient times, demons and humans have never lived alongside each other. In this generation, I have always done as humans do. The two races, human and demon, have had peace between them for hundreds of years. Now you must leave. This is your final destination, after all.\u201d\u201cHuman or demon\u2026 a demon master, you are a demon master\u2026\u201d\u201cYou accused my disciple of being a demon and nearly caused him to get possessed. You must compensate for causing him trouble to this degree.\u201d\u201cDemon master, you are a demon master, you\u2026 ahhhh!!!\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s chang pao fluttered, and a golden light pierced through the remnant soul\u2019s body, making him scream in agony. After making the same effort required to make a cup of tea, the remnant soul\u2019s blood-curdling screeches abruptly came to an end. He silently lowered his head to look at the ground, like he had no awareness.Xuan Lingzi said quietly, \u201cExcept for that person, give the reward you owe to everyone else.\u201dThe remnant soul looked at Li Xiuchen out of the corner of his eye and nodded lightly. \u201cYes.\u201dThe storm clouds in the skies got even thicker, producing a rumbling noise as if they criticized Xuan Lingzi\u2019s words.However, Xuan Lingzi ignored it and said again, \u201cTo my disciple, give the reward you owe to him.\u201dThe remnant soul nodded. \u201cYes.\u201dXuan Lingzi flicked his sleeve. Inside that wide, spacious sleeve, a blood-red light suddenly flew out.The storm clouds in the skies cried ferociously. Each bolt of lightning struck only in the vicinities of Yi Tian Mountains, and one thick, solid, devastating red bolt of lightning struck precisely towards Xuan Lingzi.A golden light flashed between Xuan Lingzi\u2019s forehead, and the Xuan Ling sword appeared in his hand. Raising his sword at the heavens, he sent his majestic spiritual energy soaring up towards the sky.The lightning and the golden sword flowed together in midair, producing a sound that shook the earth and skies.At that moment, the mountain peaks near True Lord Beidou\u2019s remnants were all razed to the ground. A powerful sound wave dispersed shaking the cultivators who had gathered around in curiosity. Cultivators below Nascent Soul stage spat out a mouthful of blood while cultivators in Qi Condensation stage suffered critical injuries along with dizziness.The storm clouds were still screaming but didn\u2019t dare send down any more lightning tribulations. And in that stone room, the remnant soul\u2019s head was lowered as he stared at the ground, and Luo Jianqing remained unconscious. And not a single soul knew that the most powerful cultivator on earth was staggering, spitting out mouthfuls of blood one after another.That blood was glittering as Xuan Lingzi propped half of his body up on Xuan Ling, and raised his head to face the remnant soul. \u201cThis belongs to my disciple.\u201dHis voice fell. That blood-red ray of light flew towards the remnant soul, who had thought to catch it, but he had not yet moved when that terrifying breath paralyzed him with awe. He only naively stood there and saw the blood-red light stop in front of his eyes.The remnant soul said respectfully, \u201cYes.\u201dXuan Lingzi muttered to himself for a very long time while staring at that red light. Finally, he brushed away the little thing inside the red light, then walked to the side of Luo Jianqing\u2019s body.His young and elegant, handsome face was covered in sweat, but his breathing was smooth and steady. It was clear that he had already fallen asleep.Xuan Lingzi looked at him silently for a very long time, then sighed softly. Finger pointed at Luo Jianqing\u2019s forehead, like how he had previously handled Li Xiuchen, he drew out a beam of white light. His movements were extremely tender with Luo Jianqing only letting out a muffled groan.A moment later, Xuan Lingzi suddenly disappeared. A ray of golden light broke through the remnants\u2019 boundaries, flying towards Tai Hua Mountain, then finally disappeared inside Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s defensive formations.Tai Hua Mountain, Cang Shuang Peak.At the summit of Cang Shuang Peak, there was a grand, imposing hall that overlooked the entire peak, emitting overwhelming righteousness. In this hall, an old man with grizzled hair was meditating on a praying mat with his back and shoulders straight.In front of him were four layers of lifebound lamps. The fourth layer had several dozens of lamps, the third had six, the second had only two lamps remaining, and finally the first layer, located at the very top, only had one golden lifebound lamp, its flames flickering.Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s sect leader Hao Xingzi\u2019s eyes were shut, meditating in cultivation. In a flash, the golden lifebound lamp suddenly went out, and Hao Xingzi opened his eyes. He looked at the one curtain with shock, and said in a quiet and astonished voice, \u201cJunior brother Xuan Lingzi?!\u201dHis voice had just fallen when Hao Xingzi transformed into a ray of white light and flew to Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s centermost Yu Xiao Peak.But in the Yi Tian Mountains, hundreds of li away from Tai Hua Mountain, the disciples of Tai Hua Mountain and Yi Tian Sect were still going through their cruel practice experience.In the Endless Wasteland, the demon beasts were too many to count. Since childhood, Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s cultivators were assigned by their masters to kill demon beasts in hand-to-hand combat at the Wan Shou Mountains. They had plenty of experience with actual combat, but not the Yi Tian Sect disciples. The majority\u2019s constitutions were not strong enough, nor did they have much experience in actual combat. Many disciples had already broken the jade piece to leave the remnants.Therefore, by the time they truly left the Endless Wasteland, Tai Hua Mountain still had fifteen people left, but Yi Tian Sect only had two remaining.The party was made up of seventeen people and ran across each other in the sixth pass. The strange thing was, they waited for a very long time in this pass, but there was only darkness, like nothing was there, which made them confused.And in that seventh pass, the Tianshu Pass, Luo Jianqing\u2019s fingers twitched, and he slowly rose to consciousness.After just going through that fight with the demon fox to stop it from possessing his body, Luo Jianqing\u2019s spiritual energy had been dried up for a while now. He didn\u2019t even have the strength to get up and could only open his eyes. He saw Li Xiuchen laying right in the corner, his entire body covered in blood.Luo Jianqing squinted. He had not reacted yet when suddenly, he felt something strange. He turned his head to look and saw a vague shadow floating in front of the praying mat, head lowered and unspeaking.Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes widened. He was already preparing to take out the bamboo umbrella from his storage ring, but he heard the remnant soul say quietly, \u201cThe practice experience has ended. You have failed.\u201dThat voice had just fallen when a white light flashed on Li Xiuchen\u2019s body. He disappeared from the remnants almost effortlessly.Luo Jianqing stared blankly at this scene, not understanding what happened at all. The only thing he did was struggle against that phantom demon fox for a very long time, then lose consciousness. How could a remnant soul suddenly appear when he had just opened his eyes, and how did Li Xiuchen seem to be so critically injured?Luo Jianqing raised a bit of spiritual energy he had just recovered, guarding against his surroundings vigilantly.The remnant soul\u2019s hoarse voice echoed, \u201cYou survived this lord\u2019s remnants, and now this lord will gift his three magical tools to you.\u201dHe paused, and then a hateful expression appeared on his face. \u201cHumans and demons must not coexist. I must exterminate the demon race! I, True Lord Beidou, rushed into the battlefield for many years and killed a great number of demon beasts by myself. Between the human and demon races, one must die! These three magical tools are the most effective against demon beasts, and they will certainly help you behead demons and wipe out devils.\u201dThree rays of white light appeared in front of Luo Jianqing.At this, Luo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026So say, what was he going to do with these?But the remnant soul was not done speaking. He continued, \u201cThis lord still has a manual here, which will be given to you as well.\u201dThis time, the remnant soul spoke very simply and did not speak of any other rubbish. A ray of blood-red light flew straight towards Luo Jianqing. At this moment, Luo Jianqing had already recovered 30% of his spiritual energy and raised his hand to catch the red light.It was a blood-red jade piece, only the size of his palm. It resembled condensed blood, brightly-colored and strikingly dazzling. In his hand, it seemed like it could burn him. At the moment it was quietly waiting for its master\u2019s inspection. A powerful oppressive aura was coming from the jade piece, turning the air stagnant.Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyebrows were knit tightly. He looked at the remnant soul. \u201cElder, is this\u2026\u201dHis voice suddenly came to a stop. In Luo Jianqing\u2019s astonished gaze, the remnant soul vacantly raised his head. His body turned into innumerable white points, fading away into the stone room. There was only a low, coarse crowing that still echoed for a very long time\u2014\u201cHuman\u2026 or demon?\u201dHis voice was mixed with obsession and regret that crossed through time.Since the remnant soul had already disappeared, Luo Jianqing was left with no choice but to examine the four things he had gotten. In his sight, one of the three was an earth-rank magical tool. Although it was quite precious, it was also something a Nascent Soul cultivator could own.Except for the blood-red jade piece, everything made Luo Jianqing feel completely bewildered.The jade piece emitted a frightening aura that seemed to cross through ancient times and attack him.Could that True Lord Beidou really have had such good fortune that he could arrange that frightening Ursa Major Seven Star Formation and obtain this frightening jade piece?After hesitating for a very long time, Luo Jianqing sent out a bit of spiritual sense and pierced through the jade piece.In a flash, a shocking, oppressive voice echoed in his ear\u2014\u2014\u201cSeize the lasting years, seize the boundless earth; seize the life energy of all living things, seize the fortune of the heavens and earth. Seize man, seize demon, seize the heavenly law \u2014 this will be known as the Nine\u2026\u201d The voice suddenly stopped, then after a moment, the voice spoke again. \u201cThis will be known as the \u2018Nine Heavenly Seizure Record\u2019.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 15": "Chapter 15Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the vast, boundless clouds and mist, the sect leader of Tai Hua Mountain, Sir Hao Xingzi, broke through clouds and sea with blinding speed and arrived at Yu Xiao Peak, which was located right in the heart of Tai Hua Mountain. At the bottom of Yu Xiao Peak, he sent a voice transmission to his junior brother. Surprisingly, the other person never responded. The honored sect leader furrowed his grizzled eyebrows and immediately went up the mountain.All Tai Hua Mountain disciples knew of the restrictions placed throughout Yu Xiao Peak. Not to mention there were still the great mountain defense formations in place. Even the little junior sister of the Seven Children of Tai Hua Mountain, Mu Tianxin, could not go up. Each time, she could only wait at the bottom of the peak for senior brother Luo to come down.However, they did not know that not only little junior sister, but even all the other honored seniors and elders, could not go up Yu Xiao Peak.Yu Xiao Peak was Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s most important forbidden area. Only Sir Xuan Lingzi, the great senior brother Luo Jianqing, and sect leader Sir Hao Xingzi could enter. If those without permission were to take a single step inside, they would be directly killed by the mountain defense formations.Before Hao Xingzi arrived at the front of the bamboo house, he suddenly could sniff out a mix of spiritual energy and barely discernable thread of vital breath in the air. Hao Xingzi opened his round eyes and hurriedly broke through the enchanted boundaries his junior brother left behind, entered the door, and was immediately stunned at the sight before him.The handsome, elegant, white-clothed honored senior was propping half of his body up on a bamboo couch, his face deathly pale, and forehead covered in sweat. The lapels were completely muddled with glaring bloodstains. There was also a pool of blood on the seat of the bamboo couch, which contained golden flickering universal qi in it.Seeing this, Hao Xingzi\u2019s eyes widened, and he cried out in alarm, \u201cHeart\u2019s blood! Junior brother, you\u2026\u201dXuan Lingzi did not speak, but his pale face already answered Hao Xingzi\u2019s question.Hao Xingzi quickly took out a bottle of medicine pills from his storage ring. The instant the dark green pill appeared, its fragrance scattered into the air. Outside, any plants that touched even a bit of the pill\u2019s fragrance danced excitedly without stopping. Hao Xingzi clapped his hands and the medicine pill flew into Xuan Lingzi\u2019s mouth.After fifteen minutes, the chaotic spiritual energy in Xuan Lingzi\u2019s body was finally nursed back to health.Hao Xingzi could not help but ask, \u201cJunior brother, what on earth happened to you? Did you perhaps enter qi deviation? Impossible. You have cultivated for more than three hundred years. Even if it may not be very long, you have always had a pure heart. You never run into internal demons, so what happened today to make you react like this?\u201dXuan Lingzi said coolly, \u201cSect leader senior brother.\u201dHao Xingzi\u2019s face was grim. He thought for a long time, and suddenly exclaimed in alarm, \u201cInternal demons! At that time, martial uncle had once ordered you to set up and pledge your life to guard those things. Perhaps something happened with them and so, you became like this? Junior brother, that is our Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s most important and forbidden thing, \u2018Nine Lotus He\u2026\u201d\u201cSect leader senior brother!\u201d Xuan Lingzi\u2019s cold voice interrupted Hao Xingzi\u2019s words. \u201cThis has no relation to that. For the time being that thing is doing fine.\u201dHis voice fell. Xuan Lingzi turned his hand to pull out a ray of blood-red light. For a split second, the flowing clouds in the sky seemed to freeze, and faint storm clouds formed above Yu Xiao Peak. When Xuan Lingzi put the thing back, the storm clouds immediately dispersed.Hao Xingzi let out a sigh of relief at this. \u201cSo long as nothing\u2019s wrong with that thing, then it will be alright.\u201d He paused and suddenly remembered, \u201cThen junior brother, is it all because\u2026\u201dXuan Lingzi spoke with a tranquil expression, \u201cA little accident happened during the newcomers\u2019 practice experience. Those remnants are not an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator\u2019s remnants. I attached a primordial spirit to Luo Jianqing as he entered the remnants and he saw that cultivator\u2019s remnant soul. He was an Out-of-Body cultivator, so naturally, something must have happened for him to fall to late-stage Nascent Soul.\u201dHao Xingzi asked in disbelief, \u201cJunior brother, didn\u2019t you make a deal that prevents you from leaving Tai Hua Mountain? How did you manage to bring out a Nascent Soul?\u201dXuan Lingzi replied calmly, \u201cI split half of it, so it was not really considered leaving Tai Hua Mountain.\u201dThese short words left Hao Xingzi speechless.Cultivators that reached Nascent Soul stage were able to form a Nascent Soul. But their Nascent Soul was nothing more than a small infant that did not have much attack power. Once they reached the Out-of-Body stage, the Nascent Soul was able to leave the body. When they reached the Mahayana stage, the Nascent Soul could be broken up however they wanted. The stronger the cultivator, the more pieces they could break up, and each Nascent Soul could fight in place of them.Therefore, during that time inside the remnants, after True Lord Beidou saw Xuan Lingzi\u2019s half Nascent Soul, he blurted out, \u201ca cultivator higher than the Mahayana stage.\u201dHowever, that was all theory. A Mahayana cultivator could only split a Nascent Soul into very small pieces. There was no other reason than that the pain of splitting up a Nascent Soul was nothing an ordinary person could ever know.A Nascent Soul was a cultivator\u2019s most sensitive part. Even someone brushing against it would cause them to feel such sharp pain that they would go numb. For example, say a physical body and a Nascent Soul collided into the same thing. The body may be in everlasting pain, but for a Nascent Soul, that pain would be a hundred times worse!Just thinking of splitting a Nascent Soul made Hao Xingzi\u2019s scalp feel numb. After a while, he heaved a sigh. \u201cDon\u2019t you treat Jianqing a bit too well?\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s calm, handsome features were not disturbed in the slightest. He said neutrally, \u201cJianqing is my disciple.\u201dWatching his own junior brother act like this, Hao Xingzi swallowed the words that he wanted to say.\u2014\u2014Those were nothing more than an Out-of-Body cultivator\u2019s remnants. So long as they had a desire to leave, nobody would come into any life-threatening danger. What\u2019s more, Jianqing had carried many magical tools and medicine pills. To go as far as to split your Nascent Soul to follow him, don\u2019t you care about him a bit too much?After all, when it came to matters between a master and his disciple, Hao Xingzi did not have much to say. After carefully asking questions about Xuan Lingzi\u2019s body, he ended with, \u201cI will go find junior sister to refine you some medicine pills to help your Nascent Soul recover promptly.\u201d Then he transformed into a ray of white light and left Yu Xiao Peak.After Hao Xingzi\u2019s departure, Xuan Lingzi, unable to support himself any longer, fell backwards, and blood welled up inside his mouth again.Like before, the blood had little specks of gold. It seemed that Xuan Lingzi would inevitably fall into a coma, his face now as pale as a sheet. Meanwhile, at Tai Hua Mountain, the lifebound golden lamp at the summit of Cang Shuang Peak kept flickering. It was a while before the flames slowly stabilized, though it was a tad darker than before.Meanwhile in the skies of Yi Tian Mountains, millions of li away, the storm clouds had longed dispersed. Many cultivators watched for a long time, but never saw any sort of magic treasure and left with anger. After waiting for a few moments, all the disciples came out of the remnants.Luo Jianqing had already put the three magical tools and blood-red jade piece in his storage ring. After being transported out, he surveyed his surroundings. Immediately, he sensed the presence of the Tai Hua Mountain disciples and flew over to them.\u201cSenior brother Luo, the seventeen disciples of Tai Hua Mountain that passed through the sixth pass have all received their rewards.\u201d As the nineteenth junior brother spoke, he took out a white jade pearl. \u201cThis Escape Droplet. It seems that you can dive fifty li underwater with it, so it could be considered a magical treasure.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded his head appreciatively. After looking all around him, he asked, \u201cHow come there\u2019s only twenty of you?\u201dThe nineteenth junior brother chuckled and said helplessly, \u201cSenior brother, that Endless Wasteland was truly dangerous. Some of us got injured and immediately crushed the white jade token to get out. When we left just now, we discovered that Li Xiuchen had already been transported out and went back to be healed by Yi Tian Sect people. So I let the other injured martial brothers follow and get healed by Yi Tian Sect too.\u201dLuo Jianqing lightly raised his eyebrows and feigned shock as he asked, \u201cEveryone got injured? Even that Li Xiuchen?\u201dThe nineteenth junior brother spread his hands and sighed. \u201cThat\u2019s right, a lot of people got injured. Apparently, some Qi Condensation disciples from Yi Tian Sect died too. Anyway, senior brother, you haven\u2019t seen Li Xiuchen\u2019s wounds yet, apparently, his are really serious. His hands are gone and he\u2019s even blind. No one knows what kind of terrible demon beast he ran into at the Endless Wasteland for him to end up like this\u2026\u201dHe spoke while Luo Jianqing led the Tai Hua Mountain disciple to Yi Tian Sect, preparing to hand him over.The nineteenth junior brother concluded, \u201cUnless an elder from Qing Lan Peak refined pills especially for Li Xiuchen\u2019s health, he will never get better for the rest of his life. Anyway, he\u2019s only a new disciple, the sect wouldn\u2019t go that far for him. Ai, senior brother, did you ask how he couldn\u2019t crush the jade piece? What kind of strength to get what kind of reward, indeed\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing laughed and said, \u201cDanger always follows the practice experience. The reward comes with risk. Don\u2019t learn from him in the future. When you give up, you must give up with conviction.\u201dThe nineteenth junior brother nodded and beamed, exposing pure white teeth.When they spotted Yi Tian Sect\u2019s Elder Zhao, Luo Jianqing lightly cupped his hands, and the other, flattered, immediately returned the favor.Luo Jianqing smiled. \u201cThis time, I have truly troubled your sect concerning these remnants. I will dutifully report to our sect about what happened during the practice experience. After our sect\u2019s elders finish their inspection, they may give the rewards to Yi Tian Sect.\u201d Pausing, Luo Jianqing added, \u201cHow are our Tai Hua Mountain disciples staying at your sect doing now?\u201dElder Zhao said respectfully, \u201cThey are fine, save for a fellow Daoist at Phase Two Qi Condensation that seems to be injured very seriously.\u201dLuo Jianqing didn\u2019t need a name to guess who the seriously injured person was. Although Li Xiuchen had been transported out very quickly, Luo Jianqing had seen Li Xiuchen\u2019s terrible injuries with his own eyes. Those kinds of injuries would be fatal to a Qi Condensation cultivator, and the fact that Li Xiuchen wasn\u2019t already dead especially surprised Luo Jianqing.He held these thoughts in his heart, but his expression betrayed none of it.His pale, elegant face showing a bit of distress, Luo Jianqing sighed, \u201cSince junior brother has been so critically injured, then may we borrow your sect to let him recuperate? Due to his current condition, I fear that he would not do so well on a long and difficult journey.\u201dElder Zhao immediately said, \u201cYes! I am afraid that every fellow Daoist of Tai Hua Mountain that had just gone through such dangerous circumstances are exhausted in body and mind. Fellow Daoist Luo, it would be best if you step into our Yi Tian Sect gates. We would be very willing to accommodate our fellow Daoists and let them cultivate breath control.\u201dHaving heard what was said, Luo Jianqing\u2019s phoenix eyes widened slightly.He had only wished to leave Li Xiuchen at Yi Tian Sect, but he did not expect Elder Zhao to actually put forward such a proposal.After thinking for a moment, Luo Jianqing nodded with a smile. \u201cThen I will inconvenience my fellow Daoist.\u201dNot long after, the entire party boarded Luo Jianqing\u2019s flying treasure boat, which majestically flew towards the gates of Yi Tian Sect. This period of rest would take three days. Yi Tian Sect welcomed Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples with generosity and did not dare neglect the Qi Foundation Phase One newcomers by even the slightest bit.By the third day, the handsome green-clothed cultivator stood in front of his bed, his head raised as he gazed at the thick, verdant greenery in the courtyard.He saw a pale yellow crane slowly fly to him from the sky, wobbling as it passed through a splendid mass of flowers. Finally, it stopped in front of Luo Jianqing and spoke, like a person, \u201cSenior brother Luo, the information you wanted to be investigated has already been investigated.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s thin lips raised slightly and split into a dazzling smile. \u201cSecond junior brother, I\u2019ve inconvenienced you. What is the situation?\u201dThe paper crane used a voice transmission seal that was so high level that it could imitate someone\u2019s tone and timbre perfectly. He heard a warm and tender voice coming from the paper crane. The second senior brother of Tai Hua Mountain Zuo Yunmo seemed to smile lightly as he said, \u201cTrue Lord Beidou was the one Out-of-Body cultivator in the past 1,000 years who had participated in the 230 year long Human-Demon War. Later, he was chased and killed by a ninth-rank demon beast, and his cultivation dropped from Out-of-Body stage to Nascent Soul stage\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 16": "Chapter 16Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 016Since ancient times, the human race and demon race were like water and fire. Conflicts sprung up everywhere.The demon race originated from the cultivation of demon beasts. Just like they said, \u201cthose who are not our kin are sure to be of a different heart\u201d. Since the beginning of ancient times, the humans and demons warred against each other time and time again over resources, up until now, where there was already a deep sea of resentment, and it was too late to ever turn back.Luo Jianqing had known about what Zuo Yunmo said about the persisting 230-year war. That war was the ultimate hatred between the two races in all history. The demon race had three demon masters, and the human race had two Mahayana stage cultivators. Among them, one of them was the Hao Ming Peak Lord of Tai Hua Mountain, Luo Jianqing\u2019s one martial ancestor.However, Luo Jianqing had presently cultivated for no more than 36 years. In that time period, everything was peaceful as can be, and no conflict broke out between the two races for a full 100 years. The high-level demon beasts were all in seclusion and did not come out, and the human race did not take the initiative to stir up conflict. Only Body-Fusion cultivators and below and demon beasts below eighth-level would battle hand-to-hand at the borders, though there was no conflict now.The Wan Shou Mountains that Luo Jianqing frequented were an unregulated zone set up by the human and demon race. Any demon beast eighth-level and below could enter as they pleased, and any cultivator Body-Fusion stage and below could enter as well. Here, life and death, poor or rich; it was all destined. The two races could freely unleash their hatred through reckless carnage.Zuo Yunmo\u2019s soft smiling voice echoed in the quiet courtyard, \u201cSenior brother, although True Lord Beidou is not strong enough, he acquired a great amount of merit during the war and obtained many treasures. When you went through the remnants during this practice experience, that was his lifebound magical tool, the Ursa Major Seven Star Formation. This is one earth-rank formation that could kill a Nascent Soul cultivator. A pity that the remnants are closed now. Otherwise, you could take over. It would be of great use to you in the future.\u201dHearing what he said, the corners of Luo Jianqing\u2019s lips raised slightly. He asked, \u201cJunior brother, when did you learn to be so analytical?\u201dZuo Yunmo said helplessly, \u201cThe sect-wide competition is in half a year. Senior brother, I certainly do not wish to be rebuked by our sect leader again.\u201dThe two people laughed and bantered for quite some time, then the paper crane brandished its wings and slowly flew off into the sky, swiftly disappearing from Luo Jianqing\u2019s view. Gazing at the crystal clear sky, Luo Jianqing slowly squinted his eyes. His sleeves flicked as he turned around to go back to his own room.After he came back, Luo Jianqing immediately took out the blood-red jade piece from his storage ring and studied it meticulously.\u201cNine Heavenly Seizure Record\u201d. The name sounded tyrannical enough, and especially the words \u201cheavenly\u201d and \u201cseizure\u201d made Luo Jianqing feel apprehensive in his heart.True Lord Beidou said that this was a manual he had gotten, but Luo Jianqing felt that this was impossible. Even if that True Lord Beidou came to own a great number of possessions during the war, set up remnants that were far beyond an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator\u2019s ability, he should not have such an extraordinary cultivation method.If True Lord Beidou truly practiced this cultivation method, then surely he would not have fallen to such a low cultivation level, been killed by a demon beast, and finally die a tragic death.After struggling against the phantom demon fox\u2019s possession, Luo Jianqing only remembered being in extreme pain and nothing else after that. When he regained consciousness, he saw Li Xiuchen, who was covered in blood.After two days, Li Xiuchen awakened. Even though he was blind in both eyes, he was not deaf nor mute. Luo Jianqing made someone question him for the truth, but Li Xiuchen only remembered that he had finally gotten to the last pass and didn\u2019t remember what happened afterwards.\u2014\u2014Li Xiuchen had also lost his memory.Luo Jianqing\u2019s intuition told him that this matter was definitely complicated. He and Li Xiuchen probably had their memories erased by someone powerful.His thoughts came and went. The only theory Luo Jianqing could come up with is that there was probably some connection to True Lord Beidou, but he was no longer able to enter the remnants and figure it out for himself.It had already been two months since Luo Jianqing reincarnated. He could clearly feel spiritual energy slowly flowing inside his body. This speed meant that when the sect-wide competitions came around half a year later, there was no way he could beat second junior brother, Zuo Yunmo, who was always working hard at cultivation. Even third junior sister Wei Qiongyin could probably defeat him.Most importantly, his cultivation levels were probably heading south.Thinking of this, Luo Jianqing tightly clutched the blood-red jade piece in his hand.Time passed outside the window. The sunset slowly fell behind the mountains, and the clear moon rose up from the east. On the second day when the morning sun soared from the earth and leapt out, Luo Jianqing walked to the window in deep thought, gazing at the bright, glittering, round sun. Finally, he let out a long sigh and went back to the couch.This time, Luo Jianqing arranged enchanted boundaries all around the room so no one looking for him would be able to go inside.He probed the jade piece with a thread of spiritual sense. Less than a moment later, that ear-splitting noise rang again. In his mind, he could read the words of the secret method \u201cNine Heavenly Seizure Record\u201d. Luo Jianqing shut his eyes and sat in the lotus position on the soft couch, his two hands forming hand seals in the air.At first, he was extremely slow, but he got faster and faster the more time passed until they were forming virtual images.\u201cWatch how dogs are cut down by all, how the world is cold and heartless; the years leave no trace behind, seeing all as worthless dregs.\u201d\u201cWe are cultivators. We cultivate our true feelings. We cultivate ourselves. We cultivate every living thing in the world, yet the one thing we do not cultivate is the heavenly law!\u201d\u201cWhat do you cultivate?\u201dThe green light on Luo Jianqing\u2019s body released. The sounds of thunder rumbled inside his mind. He suddenly opened his eyes and raised his head to look up. His gaze pierced beyond the ceiling, looking directly at the sky!\u201cI cultivate the way of seizing the heavenly law. I rebel against the heavenly law. I will become the heavens!\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s voice had just fallen when the green three-petaled lotus on his forehead erupted. Ancient qi slowly floated up from underground and took shape of a transparent phantom. As if it were a thin snake, it slithered up his body, but Luo Jianqing seemed to be completely unaware of it. The thin snake stretched inside his body and turned into boiling spiritual energy.This spiritual energy boiled like magma, frantically colliding against every inch of spiritual veins in his body. The pain made him grit his teeth tightly, but blood still flowed down from the corners of his lips. Inside this trail of blood contained boundless spiritual energy. Finally, Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t bear it any longer and spat forth a mouthful of blood!The spiritual energy inside the blood was vast as a great river. Fortunately, Luo Jianqing had used the magical tool that sixth junior brother gifted to him to set up the boundaries around him, and it could stop any curious Nascent Soul cultivator. The cultivation of Yi Tian Sect\u2019s great elders were nothing more than the middle stage of Core Formation, so they would not discover any abnormalities.The first heart\u2019s blood was only the beginning. After the thin snake entered his body, Luo Jianqing spat out mouthful after mouthful of blood, as if he was going to spit out all the blood in his body. The spiritual energy that was contained in this blood frantically rammed against the enchanted boundaries. Finally, the enchanted boundaries began to resist it little by little and it slowly dissipated into the air, returning to the skies.Luo Jianqing\u2019s boundaries did not stop tumbling.Beginning stage of Core Formation, late stage of Qi Foundation, middle stage of Qi Foundation\u2026Finally, his cultivation fell right to Qi Condensation!After Luo Jianqing spat out the last mouthful of blood, his body shook. He toppled backwards feebly and lost consciousness.At this moment, a sighing voice lowly echoed in his mind, \u201c\u2018True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record\u2019\u2026 someone from a later generation of Yu Xiao Peak?\u201dAfter the voice fell, the sound of thunder echoed again!\u201cWith every waking moment do the spirits of nature struggle; if the heavens thy desire dost follow, seize them!\u201d\u201cSeize their all-knowing power. Seize the seasons\u2019 rhythm.\u201d\u201cThe first seizure of the \u2018Nine Heavenly Seizure Record\u2019 will be the seasons!\u201dThe voice had just fallen when all the plants, flowers, and trees in the tiny courtyard started to shiver and sway timidly as if they wanted to flee. A violent wind blew past, an imaginary force that blew from their bodies, carrying rays and rays of bright light as it swept by, but did not enter Luo Jianqing\u2019s body.In a flash, Luo Jianqing\u2019s body trembled, and he abruptly sat back in meditation reflexively.His fingers wove hand-seals effortlessly as the rays of light bore into his meridians and joints all over his body. The light moistened his slowly drying meridians, restoring them back to their original state. Then it came to Luo Jianqing\u2019s dantian, approaching the golden core inside his dantian.The golden core had dried up when Luo Jianqing vomited out all the blood in his body. Now it had no strength left to counterattack and was helpless against the rays of light as it bore into it, rubbing and grinding once again.Green rays of light softly blossomed on Luo Jianqing\u2019s body, whose imaginary power had already flown outside the courtyard. They razed any vegetation they met inside Yi Tian Sect, which shook in fear until they finally gave up a bit of light as an offering.The force swept past the courtyard where the Tai Hua Mountain disciples were resting, past the hateful and derisive Li Xiuchen, past the countless infatuated young girls surrounding Luo Jianqing\u2019s courtyard, and finally to the Yi Tian Sect leader\u2019s spirit herb garden.Every single spirit herb was wiped out by the mighty force, all except a third-grade spirit herb that shook as it struggled against the force for its own life, but finally gave up a wisp of light. This light was much brighter than the others. After the light broke off, the spirit herb didn\u2019t change but instead stretched toward the sunlight without restraint.The second elder of Yi Tian Sect said with alarm, \u201cSenior brother! Doesn\u2019t the Cold Branch Grass fear sunlight? Why is your beloved third-grade Cold Branch Grass stretching its leaves below the sunlight?\u201dHaving heard what was said, the great elder was shocked as well. \u201cImpossible! I lovingly raised this Cold Branch Grass for many years. It already has spiritual sense. It is impossible for it to injure itself like this.\u201dAnd many other baffling incidents like this kept popping up one after another at Yi Tian Sect.Even the Sun-Facing Flower that always faced the sun suddenly lowered its head to look at the ground, and the plants that only blossomed during the winter suddenly sprouted buds in the spring!It appeared that these plants all gave up following the natural law and began to act as they pleased. No longer were they bound by this world\u2019s invisible rules. Under this ego-driven competition, some plants gradually wilted, while others grew even stronger.Luo Jianqing did not have any idea of what had just happened. Slowly, he rose to consciousness again and felt the strength in his body gradually recover.The rays of light flew towards his body from every direction. With each one, his qi began to slowly increase. Qi Condensation, Qi Foundation, early stage Core Formation\u2026 middle stage Core Formation!He had returned to middle stage Core Formation once again. Except for his meridians and his aching joints, it seemed that nothing had even happened. But Luo Jianqing already understood what he had just given up as he looked at the condensed chunk of blood on the floor.The spiritual energy in his body had completely vanished!If you wanted to cultivate \u201cNine Heavenly Seizure Record\u201d, then you must give up the spiritual energy that you already cultivated.Right now, although it seemed that there was no difference in the spiritual energy levels in his body, Luo Jianqing already felt that nothing like that ever happened. He felt that he and this world were totally incompatible as if he were rejected by every living thing in the world. Only the plants and flowers inside Yi Tian Sect seemed to be excitedly cheering and leaping for his awakening.This was the first seizure of \u201cNine Heavenly Seizure Record\u201d, snatching away the plants and seasons.Luo Jianqing cultivated in his courtyard for three days. When his cultivation settled, he left Yi Tian Sect and flew back in the flying treasure ship to his own junior brothers and sisters. Back then, the third elder of Yi Tian Sect said, \u201cFellow Daoist Li, it seems that he still has not yet recovered. Fellow Daoist Luo, perhaps you would like to rest a bit longer?\u201dLuo Jianqing stood in the blue skies, a green gown covering his body. His long hair blew freely in the wind, his eyebrows like they had been drawn with ink. He smiled slightly and said, \u201cNo need. I must return to my sect urgently. Many thanks for your hospitality.\u201dThe third elder said, \u201cSince this is the case, then this one will not delay you any further. Originally, sect leader senior brother wished to see you off personally, but recently the Cold Branch Grass in senior brother\u2019s garden are nearly beginning to wilt. Senior brother wishes to save them, and there is not a moment to waste.\u201dLuo Jianqing was faintly surprised when he heard that, and a bit of embarrassment flitted over his elegant face. As if the spiritual energy in his body heard the third elder\u2019s voice, it proudly rushed forth several times, like it wanted to take credit for this achievement.Luo Jianqing nodded in shame. He had not opened his mouth when the third elder added, \u201cBut the strange thing is, this morning, a second-grade spirit herb in the spirit herb garden managed to upgrade to a third-grade spirit herb. Fellow Daoist Luo, Tai Hua Mountain is famed for its long history, and their knowledge is broad and varied. Do you know what might have happened?\u201dLuo Jianqing shook his head faintly. \u201cNo, I do not.\u201dThe two exchanged pleasantries for a bit longer. Then Luo Jianqing waved his sleeve to start up the flying ship and officially departed from the Yi Tian Mountains.On the ship, the nineteenth junior brother quietly came to Luo Jianqing\u2019s door, knocked, and went inside. After all, they were returning back to their sect, and while courtesy may not have been needed when they were outside before, the nineteenth junior brother now respectfully cupped his hands to salute Luo Jianqing. \u201cGreat senior brother, I understand that we are returning to Tai Hua Mountain, but may I ask if that Li Xiuchen\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing had just been lowering his gaze to a strand of Immortal Grass. Having heard what was said, he said neutrally, \u201cJunior brother Li\u2019s injuries are especially severe. You have said before, that at the very least he should have a Calamity Passage elder who would take up the task, or perhaps have the ability to help him recover.\u201dThe nineteenth junior brother furrowed his brows in confusion as he listened to him speak.Luo Jianqing said calmly, \u201cOur elders are the towers of strength of our sect. Helping him recover would damage our elders\u2019 cultivation. Tell sect leader martial uncle what I said to you. As for how he will deal with it, that has nothing to do with us.\u201d Pausing, Luo Jianqing turned his head to face the nineteenth junior brother and smiled. \u201cJunior brother Li\u2019s injuries are serious, and he cannot cultivate. Since this is the case, the resources of the inner disciples are going to waste. For him to recover, make him move outside Hao Ming Peak before his body recovers. I think after you return, ask fourth junior brother, and he will surely know what to do.\u201dThe nineteenth junior brother was stunned, and then finally chuckled mischievously. \u201cYes! Great senior brother, I know now.\u201dLooking at the nineteenth junior brother\u2019s increasingly distant shadow, the smile on Luo Jianqing\u2019s face gradually disappeared.Naturally, he could guess what the nineteenth junior brother was thinking. Nothing else should be done other than drive this arrogant brat with all bark and no bite out of inner Hao Ming Peak, and he will be perfectly content. But to Luo Jianqing, he wished for Li Xiuchen to die!The scene he saw right before he died in his past life was still fresh in his memory. Luo Jianqing would not dare forget it, but nowadays he had already broken away from the heavenly will a little bit. Naturally he felt that if the heavenly will dropped 3,000 consciousness, then at the very least 2,000 was gathered onto Li Xiuchen\u2019s body!He could not kill Li Xiuchen.At least for now, he absolutely could not kill Li Xiuchen.And Li Xiuchen had a great fortune, a great destiny, yet what could a cripple do with great fortune? Only\u2026All his achievements would end up being useful to someone else.Luo Jianqing\u2019s lips raised in a faint smile.The next day, everyone made their majestic return back to Tai Hua Mountain.The disciples who had just gone through the practice experience felt like they had turned over a new leaf and proudly spoke to their martial brothers, who hadn\u2019t gone through the remnants, about what happened there. And for Luo Jianqing, he went to Cang Shuang Peak to give the jade piece to the elders and wrote down what happened during the practice experience.After the elder in charge approved of it, Luo Jianqing saluted and flew back to Yu Xiao Peak.Right when he had just settled down, he heard a clear, cold voice behind his body. \u201cViolating your master\u2019s orders and leaving the mountain by yourself. Jianqing, when have you become so bold and shameless?\u201dLuo Jianqing shivered and turned around stiffly.In front of the verdant bamboo and green mountains, an honored senior in a white chang pao gazed down at him with a cool gaze.Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart gradually became ice-cold as he stared at the other person without any trace of feeling in his eyes, only sensing his throat becoming rough. He lowered his head and said stubbornly, \u201cMaster, this disciple has always practiced cultivation earnestly without rest. The newcomers\u2019 practice experience is an important matter in our sect. Naturally, as I am the great senior brother, it is only right that I should lead them.\u201d\u201cYet you still dare argue with me!\u201d As he spoke, a mighty force erupted in a split second, suppressing Luo Jianqing so he could not raise his head.Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart hurt as he listened to these cold words. Gritting his teeth he said, \u201cJianqing does not know what he did wrong!\u201dAfter a while, he heard Xuan Lingzi say calmly, \u201cSince this is the case, then let your master see the results of your cultivation. Endure ten attacks, and this matter will be forgiven. Otherwise, I will punish you by secluding you within Yu Xiao Peak for a year, and will not let you out!\u201dHis voice had just fallen when an expansive sword light flew straight towards Luo Jianqing. He reflexively drew back, but the sword light still cut off a strand of hair. A green light flashed between his forehead, and Shuang Fu appeared in his hand.He saw Xuan Lingzi swap the sword for bamboo, and said with a voice cold as ice, \u201cYour master has suppressed his cultivation to early stage Core Formation.\u201dLuo Jianqing grit his teeth. \u201cYes!\u201dTwo figures, one white and one green, flew rapidly through the bamboo forest. Shuang Fu released burst after burst of lightning snakes but were all blocked by the unassuming bamboo sword. The bamboo sword had nothing remarkable about it. It was only because its wielder was the world\u2019s strongest cultivator. It rose up sharply and lifted a mighty sword force, pressing Shuang Fu down that it had no strength to resist.Luo Jianqing struggled as he blocked Xuan Lingzi\u2019s attacks. This time, he seemed to be truly furious, as each attack headed straight for Luo Jianqing\u2019s vital points. Although he suppressed his cultivation to early-stage Core Formation, his cultivation level surpassed Luo Jianqing\u2019s by miles. A mere thread of sword intent alone was enough to make Luo Jianqing roll over.Another ray of golden sword light flashed past yet again. Luo Jianqing hastily dodged, though a trail of blood marked his face.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s face remained impassioned, and the force behind his attacks grew stronger with each blow. On the ninth attack, his sword pointed at Luo Jianqing\u2019s chest. Luo Jianqing raised Shuang Fu to block him, his entire body shifting to the side.The bamboo sword split Luo Jianqing\u2019s sleeve, exposing snow white skin. The red mark on it was bright and dazzling as if a red flower was blooming, creating an extremely beautiful contrast against his fair skin.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s pupils shrunk, and his movements suddenly came to a stop.Now!Luo Jianqing poured all his spiritual energy into Shuang Fu. Immediately, the sword light flared up, and the silver lightning around Shuang Fu\u2019s blade rolled and boiled. Luo Jianqing pulled up his sword and thrust it towards Xuan Lingzi, who, surprisingly enough, did not resist. When the sword light and the lightning were nearing his face, he hurriedly dodged, and a strand of hair was cut off.Luo Jianqing returned Shuang Fu between his forehead. \u201cMaster, this disciple defeated you on the tenth attack.\u201dXuan Lingzi was completely silent.Luo Jianqing raised his eyes in astonishment and just caught Xuan Lingzi looking at his tattered cuffs with a complex gaze. Luo Jianqing turned his head to look at that red scar, and said quietly, \u201cI seem to have gotten this mark by something inside the remnants. I used Concentrated Jade Syrup, but it would not disappear. This was nothing important, so I ignored it. Master, do you know what made this scar?\u201dA red cloud quickly flew across Xuan Lingzi\u2019s fair face. Once his face was cold again, he sent Luo Jianqing flying three meters away with a flick of his sleeve, then said neutrally, \u201cYour master\u2026 does not know either. But this seems to be nothing important, so pay it no mind. As you have cultivated well, this time you will be in seclusion for half a year. When the sect-wide competition arrives, you may leave.\u201dLuo Jianqing stared blankly when he heard what he said, but finally, he nodded in agreement.In a blink of an eye, Xuan Lingzi vanished, like he did not even wish to spare another second for his own disciple.Luo Jianqing looked on dumbly at this scene. After a while, he sighed, and said to himself with a bitter smile, \u201cI remember that each time little junior sister went back to do the practice experience, Lady Yu Qingzi looked after her with the utmost care. She wished she could lock up little junior sister and never let her go out for the practice experience again.\u201dWith only a faint smiling expression on his elegant face, Luo Jianqing peacefully gazed toward the confining bamboo door, and whispered, \u201cWu Yin, I escaped within an inch of my life this time, but you didn\u2019t show the slightest bit of concern. Do you\u2026 even care at all?\u201dHis bitter, pained voice gradually dissipated into the air. Luo Jianqing broke through the bamboo forest and quickly returned to his bamboo house.Half a year hurried by. One early morning, a pale yellow figure appeared at the base of Yu Xiao Peak.The arrival\u2019s face was delicate and pretty. Though he was not very handsome, his features were soft and tender. He said in a loud voice, \u201cGreat senior brother, there\u2019s only three days until the sect-wide competition begins. Master ordered me to come and tell you to be there within a shichen.\u201dThis was the second of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Seven Children, Cang Shuang Peak\u2019s inheriting great disciple, Zuo Yunmo.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 17": "Chapter 17Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 017Cultivators from the outside world called the seven inheriting great disciples of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s peaks \u201cTai Hua\u2019s Seven Children\u201d for a reason.These seven were the most remarkable disciples that ever existed in Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s entire history. Save for the little junior sister Mu Tianxin, who specialized in refining medicine and whose cultivation differed slightly, the other six were the very first to achieve Core Formation out of nearly a hundred disciples. They never failed to reach the top ranks in each sect-wide competition.To a cultivator, age was fleeting. Before Luo Jianqing formed his golden core, he was actually the little junior brother. However, Tai Hua Mountain had a custom. Forming a golden core implied \u201cbeing able to walk anywhere under the skies, not failing Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s name\u201d. Therefore, whoever formed a golden core first among the direct disciples would become the great senior brother.Zuo Yunmo came before Luo Jianqing in order of age, but he was ranked second simply because he formed a golden core later than Luo Jianqing by a year.This was the first time Luo Jianqing saw Zuo Yunmo after his rebirth.His second junior brother and third junior sister Wei Qiongyin were the same in that they were both cultivation fanatics. Zuo Yunmo wished he could shut himself inside the mountain and never come out, cultivating all day long except to manage Cang Shuang Peak\u2019s affairs.Among Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children, Zuo Yunmo had the most ordinary constitution. The great senior brother Luo Jianqing had a one-in-a-million superior level constitution, and the other martial brothers and sisters all had a great constitution, except for Zuo Yunmo who had a decent constitution. However, this did not mean Zuo Yunmo was weak.The only one who could ever match Luo Jianqing in the sect-wide competition was Zuo Yunmo.After being in seclusion for half a year, Luo Jianqing came down the mountain after hearing Zuo Yunmo\u2019s voice, his clothes not even tidied up. Zuo Yunmo smiled faintly upon seeing his hurried manner, extending a hand to help his senior brother fix up his clothes. \u201cSenior brother, you are this old, yet you still continue to act like an impatient child?\u201dHe spoke only with resignation and tenderness, voice as gentle as a spring breeze.Luo Jianqing was caught off guard when the other person pressed his head. Feeling helpless as well, he was obliged to say, \u201cHow can you say that while I\u2019m still the great senior brother? Junior brother, are you trying to lose face?\u201dZuo Yunmo\u2019s delicate face betrayed a hint of astonishment. Finally, he pretended to be hurt and said, \u201cI thought of our childhood when this junior brother would take senior brother to play all over Tai Hua Mountain. Senior brother, in those days, you especially loved to sit on my shoulders and let me take you over the clouds. This was at least thirty years ago. Have you forgotten, senior brother?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s face was full of shame. He immediately changed the subject: \u201cWhat about the sect-wide competition?\u201dZuo Yunmo immediately burst into a detailed explanation.The half-year period of seclusion had already passed by earlier. A few days ago, Luo Jianqing noticed the time and asked Xuan Lingzi if he could come out of seclusion. Xuan Lingzi did not oppose him at all, only replying coldly, \u201cDo not make Yu Xiao Peak lose face,\u201d then continued to cultivate in seclusion.At this moment, Luo Jianqing was flying with Zuo Yunmo towards Cang Shuang Peak.Although he was the great senior brother, Zuo Yunmo was much better suited for handling sect related affairs. He spoke very clearly about the details and crucial points of this sect-wide competition. Each time when he raised an important matter, he would remind Luo Jianqing to pay attention, though his tone was always respectful and never challenged the great senior brother\u2019s authority.Luo Jianqing listened and nodded, but his gaze unconsciously wandered off to Zuo Yunmo\u2019s face.In his past life, on Duan Qing Cliff where his body was buried, Li Xiuchen shamed him for slaughtering his fellow sect members with a voice of righteousness.Although he had already fallen into demonic cultivation at that time, there was no way Luo Jianqing would ever hurt his fellow sect members. However, that time, the entire world believed that he killed his own two junior brothers, and even his master Xuan Lingzi would not stand up for him.Because the evidence was too damning.Luo Jianqing soon fell into demonic cultivation after being driven out from Tai Hua Mountain. The sect leader of Tai Hua Mountain, Sir Hao Xingzi, issued a Tai Hua command to the rest of the world that this degenerate traitor was wanted for arrest, making Luo Jianqing go through an especially depressing period of time. Three years after it was issued, two people found him: Zuo Yunmo and his sixth junior brother Xiu Hen.The three engaged in a great battle in the Far North. No matter what great talent Luo Jianqing was endowed with, he still lost to his two junior brothers because how exhausted he was from running. That time, Xiu Hen stepped forward, and said with grief and anger, \u201cGreat senior brother, follow us back. I will definitely ask what sect leader martial uncle thinks. I will not believe that you are truly that kind of person!\u201dHowever, Zuo Yunmo stopped Xiu Hen and faced Luo Jianqing.Up until his death, Luo Jianqing would never forget how his second junior brother who was older than him, looked at him with a complex gaze that burned like fire, as if he could see the improper feelings he held for his master in his heart.Zuo Yunmo was always smiling, but back then, there was no smile on his face.When Xuan Lingzi carried Luo Jianqing back to Yu Xiao Peak as a baby, Sir Xuan Lingzi\u2019s naturally cold disposition made it hard for him to take care of a child. So he let Zuo Yunmo, who was in his teens those days, take care of Luo Jianqing as he grew up. From Zuo Yunmo\u2019s fumbling inexperience at the beginning, to his later attentive care, Luo Jianqing\u2019s childhood was filled with an older brother\u2019s warmth.Zuo Yunmo wasn\u2019t wrong. Luo Jianqing indeed enjoyed playing with him in his childhood, until he officially began cultivation and they gradually drifted apart.The one who understood Luo Jianqing the most in this world was not Xuan Lingzi, or even Luo Jianqing himself, but Zuo Yunmo.In the gales of the Far North, Zuo Yunmo stopped his impulsive sixth junior brother and faced the weary Luo Jianqing, who had fallen into demonic cultivation. At last, he let out a heavy sigh and said, \u201cYou have already turned to demonic cultivation. Naturally, you cannot exist alongside us righteous cultivators. Luo Jianqing, you cannot return to Tai Hua Mountain. Fend for yourself. You still have a long life ahead.\u201dThen Zuo Yunmo stopped Xiu Hen and let Luo Jianqing go.After three days, Luo Jianqing finally discovered that his two junior brothers died at the Far North, and even their bones could not be found.Everyone whispered that Luo Jianqing took advantage of his junior brothers\u2019 friendship and killed them both. But what no one knew was that after Luo Jianqing found out, he nearly fell apart and even went back to the Far North in spite of all its dangers. In the end, he never found their bodies, only the tassel on Zuo Yunmo\u2019s lifebound sword.The lifebound lamps had already gone out. There was no doubt the two were dead, and they also died without a funeral.Luo Jianqing was hated by his junior brothers and sisters until the end of his past life, except for the other six of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Seven Children who had no complaints against him.The fifth junior brother, Huo Yuchong, was not close to him but never held any hate for him. The fourth junior brother, Xie Zizhuo, would speak up for Luo Jianqing time and time again, but was stopped by iron-clad evidence. The third junior sister, Wei Qiongyin, never raised any questions, but after Luo Jianqing was driven out from Tai Hua Mountain, she immediately shut herself up in seclusion, and Luo Jianqing never did hear if she ever came out. And his little junior sister was absolutely heartbroken, but she was stopped by her cultivation partner Li Xiuchen.\u201cIn this sect-wide competition, the four schools and the other sects will be able to send people to come to see the matches. Master told fourth junior brother and me to organize the reception. But senior brother, you know that fourth junior brother keeps duelling with fifth junior brother these past several months. I fear there will not be much time. Senior brother, I don\u2019t suppose you would be willing to do your junior brother a favor?\u201dHaving been lost in distant memories, Luo Jianqing was startled back to the present when he heard him.He turned his head to face Zuo Yunmo and saw his pupils shrink. Then he raised his hand to tuck a long strand of hair behind his ear, and said helplessly, \u201cSenior brother, what happened in the past few days to make you look like this\u2026\u201d Zuo Yunmo paused, then smiled. \u201cTo make you look so sad.\u201dLuo Jianqing quickly readjusted his expression. \u201cNothing important. Anyways, what did you say just now, junior brother? I was just thinking about something and didn\u2019t hear you clearly.\u201dZuo Yunmo was not annoyed at all and explained to him again.Luo Jianqing said, \u201cAlright, since fourth junior brother is occupied, let\u2019s organize this together.\u201dZuo Yunmo smiled as he nodded.The two quickly arrived at the plaza of Cang Shuang Peak\u2019s main hall and walked towards the main hall. After walking half the distance, Luo Jianqing could not help asking quietly, \u201cJunior brother, this sword tassel\u2026 seems a bit worn, why did you not change it even once?\u201dThey were hit by a burst of wind. Luo Jianqing\u2019s words were drowned out by the wind, and Zuo Yunmo did not answer, as if he did not hear him.But before they entered, Luo Jianqing heard the amusement in Zuo Yunmo\u2019s voice as he spoke next to him. \u201cSenior brother, your junior brother has always been a sentimental person.\u201dLuo Jianqing stopped walking, but Zuo Yunmo already went inside the main hall.After nearly an hour, Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children were all assembled inside Ling Yun Hall. They were waiting for the hurrying Sir Hao Xingzi.Even while they were inside Ling Yun Hall, fifth junior brother still chased after fourth junior brother for a fight. Every kind of magical tool was lined up in preparation for battle, and there was also a fifth level demon beast he set loose. It was like he was saying, \u201cLaozi will not peel your skin off today, Xie Zizhuo. You are just a weak old man!\u201dXie Zizhuo continued to plead, \u201cJunior brother! Junior brother! That was only a sixth level demon beast, aren\u2019t I your dear senior brother! That demon beast may be valuable, but your senior brother is even more important!\u201dThe fifth junior brother Huo Yuchong, who had short red hair, spat and cursed, \u201cNonsense! You, Xie Zizhuo, are not even higher than a soft hair on Laozi\u2019s demon beasts! Who do you call your junior brother? Laozi is your enemy!\u201dXie Zizhuo cried and wailed with grief. \u201cIt\u2019s already been half a year, how long are you going to hold this grudge against me!\u201dHuo Yuchong sneered. \u201cUntil you catch another sixth level demon beast for me!!!\u201dThis was the first time that Luo Jianqing knew about this. Fifth junior brother\u2019s sixth level demon beast really was dead, but in his past life, he had never heard about fifth junior brother chasing after fourth junior brother for an entire half a year.He saw little junior sister pull on his sleeve, whispering, \u201cGreat senior brother, I didn\u2019t refine the third level medicine pill very well. I\u2019ve given you the pills I\u2019ve refined for you to try out several times, but I still hadn\u2019t succeeded in refining a third grade pill for that boy Xie Zizhuo. By the time I finally managed to refine one, I heard that the demon beast was already dead.\u201dLuo Jianqing felt like he had made a mistake somewhere. \u201c\u2026\u201dBut little junior sister didn\u2019t see anything wrong and added more fuel to the flame. \u201cSenior brother, this is the medicine pill I gave to Xie Zizhuo before. Take it. Since that guy can\u2019t use it anymore, you should use it. When you tame a spiritual beast, this pill will save it.\u201dXie Zizhuo was worn out but angry at the same time. \u201cLittle junior sister, that\u2019s the stuff that I found for you!\u201dMu Tianxin chuckled and rolled her eyes. \u201cYour stuff is my stuff. You give me, Mu Tianxin, something that I put in my mouth and you want me to spit it out? Not a chance!\u201dLuo Jianqing felt like there was a hot piece of coal in his hand. \u201c\u2026\u201dEveryone messed around for a while, then they saw that the white-bearded Sir Hao Xingzi was about to arrive, but Xie Zizhuo was still messing around with Huo Yuchong. Luo Jianqing knit his brows slightly. He had just thought about stopping the two when suddenly a sword light flashed and he saw Zuo Yunmo lifting the two in each hand.Just as he saw Luo Jianqing draw out Shuang Fu, Zuo Yunmo smiled slightly. \u201cNo need to trouble senior brother. I will get these two to Xunjie Gate later.\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dXie Zizhuo, \u201c!!!\u201dHuo Yuchong, \u201cFine! When I get to Xunjie Gate, let\u2019s see where this little bastard will run to now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 18": "Chapter 18Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 018Huo Yuchong still wanted to compete with Xie Zizhuo, but Luo Jianqing coughed quietly. Cautiously, Huo Yuchong raised his gaze to glance at his great senior brother and finally decided to keep silent. He mumbled begrudgingly, \u201cI\u2019ll get my revenge later,\u201d then obediently stood to the side.Luo Jianqing stood with dignity among his fellow disciples. After all, in the cultivation world, the strongest came out on top. Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children were famed throughout the outside world, but if they came across someone of their own sect, the great senior brother would beat them by a mile.Zuo Yunmo could stand against Luo Jianqing once or twice, but among the other five, even the third senior sister Wei Qiongyin could not match Luo Jianqing.Shortly after, Sir Hao Xingzi flew over on a cloud and sat down in the very center of Ling Yun Hall.As though he did not notice the earlier squabble among the disciples, Hao Xingzi carried on, highlighting the important points of the sect-wide competition, before passing it on to Zuo Yunmo to further explain.\u201cThe 24 of you newcomers are just in time for this year\u2019s sect-wide competition. All peaks must remember to remind the new disciples not to seek victory, but seek to learn. This does not apply to Yu Xiao Peak. Yunmo, you are in charge.\u201dZuo Yunmo stepped forward and nodded. \u201cYes, Master.\u201dThese years, Yu Xiao Peak\u2019s only disciple was Luo Jianqing. The participants in each sect-wide competition were few, and it did not seem that the other peaks were as unusually enthusiastic. However, Luo Jianqing was quietly cheerful, since he could get first place for Yu Xiao Peak just by himself.When he was at Qi Condensation stage, the first person to achieve Qi Condensation was from Yu Xiao Peak. When he reached Qi Foundation stage, the first person to achieve Qi Foundation was, of course, from Yu Xiao Peak. Nowadays, he firmly held the position of having the highest cultivation out of this generation of disciples. The winner of the sect-wide competition was matched by none, and even Zuo Yunmo couldn\u2019t hold a candle to them.Inside Ling Yun Hall, the great senior brother in his white wide-sleeved robe had an unhurried expression, just like the towering summit of Yu Xiao Peak, cold and unapproachable. Long tassels hung from Luo Jianqing\u2019s waist, which held a tiny bead of green jade. This symbolized that someone belonged to Yu Xiao Peak.The way he stood calmly seemed to tell everyone that he was one of a kind.It was not because of his exceptional beauty; it was because it was Luo Jianqing, Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s unrivalled great senior brother.Sir Hao Xingzi had been the leader of Tai Hua Mountain for many years. When he gave explanations, it was usually a bit long-winded. All the other inheriting great disciples\u2019 minds were already wandering except for Zuo Yunmo. Even Luo Jianqing was standing straight as a pole, but his thoughts were already turning towards cultivation.No one knew how much time had passed until a smiling voice was heard by his ear. \u201cSenior brother, I\u2019m going to make a breakthrough.\u201dOnce his words fell, Luo Jianqing was suddenly roused and stared with astonishment at Zuo Yunmo, who was standing by his side.Zuo Yunmo was wearing Cang Shuang Peak\u2019s light-colored uniform. His eyes curved slightly as he whispered to Luo Jianqing in front of his master, \u201cThis time, I will try my hardest, so I hope senior brother will too.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded seriously. \u201cI am prepared for anything you throw at me.\u201dAfter Sir Hao Xingzi talked for another 20 minutes, he noticed how indifferent the inheriting great disciples were. Depressed, the white-haired old man coughed and continued, \u201cAfter I finish speaking of these matters, Yunmo will carefully warn you once again. But you must prepare yourselves well for what I\u2019m about to say next.\u201dEveryone immediately looked seriously towards Hao Xingzi.Hao Xingzi\u2019s expression gradually became more grave as he spoke grimly, \u201cA demonic cultivator has appeared in Changzhou.\u201dThe main hall was suddenly in an uproar.Wei Qiongyin\u2019s face was cold when she stepped forward, saying, \u201cMartial uncle, I wish to be the first one to wipe them out!\u201dHao Xingzi waved his wide sleeve. \u201cThat demonic cultivator wiped out an entire sect and killed two great elders. The elder with the highest cultivation had already reached Nascent Soul stage. You will only be throwing away your life!\u201dWei Qiongyin\u2019s cool and elegant face was full of frost. Upon hearing Hao Xingzi\u2019s words, she clenched her teeth as she spoke, \u201cI must kill all demonic cultivators!\u201dHao Xingzi sighed and did not speak any further.Wei Qiongyin had come to Tai Hua Mountain when she was at Qi Foundation stage and hadn\u2019t grown up there at all. It was reasonable to say that Tai Hua Mountain only accepted new disciples who had no cultivation, but Wei Qiongyin\u2019s parents were best friends with the Bi Can Peak Lord through life or death. After demonic cultivators wiped out her family, the Bi Can Peak Lord took Wei Qiongyin as a disciple.All cultivators under heaven cultivated the 81 Greater Daos and the 3,000 Lesser Daos.Among them, human cultivation branched out into three different cultivation paths: Buddhist cultivation, ghost cultivation, and demonic cultivation. Cultivating by the Greater Daos was the most basic, while Buddhist cultivators universally ferried across all the common people under the heavens. Ghost cultivators were the ghosts of people that cultivated after death. However, demonic cultivators were the one exception.Xuantian had few demonic cultivators, so few that ordinary cultivators could not find any traces of them, but they were ferociously strong. Their hand sealing was cruel and vicious, and they discriminated against no one when dealing out punishment. Even in the Human-Demon War, demonic cultivators joined hands with other cultivators in an effort against the enemy, but as long as they were not fighting against the demon race, they instead went over the top killing human cultivators.Luo Jianqing knew that demonic cultivators were usually reclusive and very rarely met together. But every single demonic cultivator respected a demonic cultivation master who was at late Mahayana stage. This person\u2019s cultivation was lower than Xuan Lingzi, and it could even be said that he was the second-best cultivator on earth.The demon master set up his own demonic cultivation temple, which many demonic cultivators depended upon. He was the only demonic cultivator that set up his own school or sect, while all the others were wandering cultivators.But even one wandering cultivator was enough to give a righteous cultivator a headache. The reason was that before Nascent Soul stage, demonic cultivators were not any different from other cultivators, except they were much stronger than normal cultivators. And once they reached Nascent Soul, demonic cultivators were fierce and powerful. Any normal, ordinary cultivator had no other option but death if they met one.Thinking of this, Luo Jianqing stepped forward and asked, \u201cSect leader martial uncle, about this demonic cultivator that appeared, do you want to send elders to resolve this?\u201dHao Xingzi lightly nodded. \u201cThey are nothing higher than Nascent Soul stage. This time, Tai Hua Mountain will send an elder at Out-of-Body stage to lead the first three winners of this sect-wide competition to go out and practice.\u201d He paused and added, \u201cYunmo, tell your martial brothers about the specifics.\u201dZuo Yunmo smiled. \u201cYes.\u201dAfter an hour, everyone went together, soaring on clouds as they returned back to their respective peaks to handle affairs. Luo Jianqing was left at Cang Shuang Peak, working with Zuo Yunmo to manage admittance to the sect-wide competition.Even though Zuo Yunmo asked Luo Jianqing for help, he ended up doing most of the work. As big as Yu Xiao Peak was, Xuan Lingzi and his disciple were the only two there. Even if he was the great senior brother, Luo Jianqing was not very good at managing internal affairs. Instead, Zuo Yunmo was usually the one who helped the honored sect leader with those matters and was quite experienced in it.When the sky was getting dark, Luo Jianqing walked out first, but before leaving, he could not help but ask, \u201cJunior brother, Changzhou\u2019s Liu Yan Valley opened early this time because the demonic cultivator was making trouble. Are you going too?\u201dZuo Yunmo smiled slightly and asked softly, \u201cSenior brother, do you not believe that your junior brother can become one of the first three Core Formation disciples?\u201dLuo Jianqing hesitated for a moment before shaking his head. \u201cIf there really were a demonic cultivator causing a fuss, then you should remain at Tai Hua Mountain and help out sect leader martial uncle.\u201d And besides, you have no magical tools to help you at Liu Yan Valley, you\u2019ll be recovering from your critical injuries for half a year\u2026Luo Jianqing did not say the last part, but he could not hide the anxiety emerging on his face under the moonlight. His long, ink-black brows were knit tightly, and light glimmered in his phoenix eyes like stars. A very long time had passed, but he did not hear any answer from Zuo Yunmo.Luo Jianqing could not help but raise his head and saw his always composed junior brother watching him with an indescribable gaze. After a while, he finally said, \u201cSenior brother, you do not need to worry. I promise with absolute certainty that even if nothing good will happen at Liu Yan Valley, if I could help you win the magical tools, then that is already some success.\u201dLuo Jianqing tried to persuade him again, but Zuo Yunmo only smiled and stayed silent.When Luo Jianqing flew towards Yu Xiao Peak, he did not see the smile on Zuo Yunmo\u2019s face slowly fade away or the light sigh that followed.A beam of green light rapidly flew towards Yu Xiao Peak. Luo Jianqing had still not ascended when he saw someone waiting at the base of the peak.Luo Jianqing smiled in understanding and dropped behind the person. He raised his eyebrows, asking, \u201cHow long did you wait?\u201dXie Zizhuo\u2019s face immediately darkened. He snorted, \u201cSenior brother, I\u2019ve been waiting on you for 20 minutes already!\u201dLuo Jianqing produced a white jade bottle from his storage ring. \u201cI spoke with second junior brother a bit too long. This third-level medicine bottle was something that you found and refined. You should keep it, as it could be very useful to you later on.\u201dBut Xie Zizhuo refused the medicine pills. \u201cI don\u2019t need it. If little junior sister catches sight of this, she\u2019ll get angry at me again and chase me all over Tai Hua Mountain.\u201d Pausing, Xie Zizhuo chuckled and vulgarly withdrew his neck. He moved right to Luo Jianqing\u2019s ear and spoke, getting right to the point, \u201cSenior brother, the past six months I\u2019ve been working as hard as I can, so I won\u2019t disappoint you.\u201dLuo Jianqing raised his eyebrows and asked. \u201cWhat? What did you do?\u201dXie Zizhuo clapped his hands together, and an unrelenting torrent of words began to pour from his mouth. \u201cFirst I have to bring up what I did before the past six months! I was thinking during that time that senior brother, you\u2019d seclude yourself as soon as you came back and give me a whole mess to deal with. How could I talk about Li Xiuchen being the second best out of the new disciples and becoming an inner disciple of our Hao Ming Peak, and how he kept to himself when he went out, but when he came back he suddenly changed, my hands were completely full\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing knew from experience that Xie Zizhuo exaggerated a lot. In his words, Li Xiuchen basically died and came back 10 times. Each life was full of pain and suffering, even more tragic than the eighteenth layer of hell. And Xie Zizhuo\u2019s descriptions of himself were vivid and brilliant, admired and revered by countless disciples.Luo Jianqing\u2019s face was full of amusement as he listened to Xie Zizhuo talk. When Xie Zizhuo had talked for roughly an hour, he asked, \u201cThirsty?\u201dXie Zizhuo, \u201c\u2026A little.\u201dLuo Jianqing gave a snort of disdain and chided, \u201cThen speak plainly!\u201dXie Zizhuo, \u201c\u2026\u201d Senior brother, you bully!!!Actually, even though Xie Zizhuo was exaggerating a little, Li Xiuchen really did become completely miserable this past half year. First was his palm, which may have been completely healed, but his meridians were clogged; another was his blindness, which no elder wanted to waste their cultivation on, so Li Xiuchen was a bit\u2026 blind. From day to night, he could not see anything clearly.The most important thing was that Xie Zizhuo dedicated an incredible amount of energy to bullying this new disciple.He did not say mention that he sent the other to be an outer disciple, or that he usually sent people to harass Li Xiuchen. Every time Li Xiuchen said a sentence to him such as, \u201cDo not deceive a poor young man\u201d or \u201cSooner or later you will all be trampled beneath my feet\u201d, Xie Zizhuo would get an excited gleam in his eyes and make people come beat him up.\u2014\u2014Being beaten will gain you a certain reputation, watch closely, Li Xiuchen; your disrespect towards your senior brother will turn into a hail of curses!Anyway, the truth was that although Xie Zizhuo spoke of his constant troublemaking, Li Xiuchen was really not very popular at Hao Ming Peak. Ever since he became blind, he became even more irascible and treated the servants who had no cultivation in an absolutely disgusting manner, but to the other martial brothers, he was polite and well-mannered.Once there was a Qi Foundation disciple that walked right by and ignored him, only saying carelessly in passing, \u201cIt\u2019s too dark at night to see the mountain road, let\u2019s walk a bit faster.\u201d Li Xiuchen suddenly stumbled on his walking stick out of anger, making the other person confused and a bit embarrassed.In the cultivation world where strength dominated, a Qi Condensation disciple\u2019s eyes suddenly flashing toward the sky was extremely offensive.When Xie Zizhuo got to this point, he didn\u2019t understand it either. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty weird.\u201dXie Zizhuo didn\u2019t get it at all, but Luo Jianqing understood a little.When all was said and done, Li Xiuchen was only a young man in his teens, and his temperament was not yet stable. When they met in the past, Luo Jianqing discovered that Li Xiuchen seemed that he was aware of his own good fortune and opportunity. He had many magical tools, and so Luo Jianqing made a guess: Li Xiuchen was the same as him. He also had that book \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d.However, Li Xiuchen seemed to have no memories of his past life, which really surprised Luo Jianqing.Anyway, so long as Li Xiuchen had \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d, then his rude conduct made sense. Because Li Xiuchen knew the heavens were on his side, he also knew that he was the main character in the book \u201cSeeking Immortality\u201d. That was why he seemed to lack willpower or sense, so when things didn\u2019t go the way he planned, he would lose his bearing and be unable to act.For example, in the book, Li Xiuchen was a disciple of Yu Xiao Peak, and the other disciples looked up to him. He had no need to get involved with Hao Ming Peak or the other disciples. When he had no point of reference, naturally Li Xiuchen revealed his true colors, making other people disgusted with him.There was one point that made Luo Jianqing knit his brows tightly: \u201cHas he reached Phase Four of Qi Condensation?\u201dXie Zizhuo was still depressed. \u201cYes! Everyone that I sent told me he never cultivated once, but he\u2019d somehow gotten to Phase Four of Qi Condensation already! Senior brother, you said that he does not have a superior-level constitution, he never had any constitution from the start, but then how did he cultivate so quickly\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing was silent. After a moment, the senior and junior brother said their goodbyes at the bottom of Yu Xiao Peak.Xie Zizhuo\u2019s story definitely clarifies what was going on with Li Xiuchen and still wanted to continue bullying that new disciple who looked towards the sky. But Luo Jianqing smiled lightly, while he hid the growing sentiments in his heart.By the time Luo Jianqing returned to Tai Hua Mountain, the two bamboo houses shone like jade in the moonlight, cold and silent.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s door was firmly shut. It seemed that he did not care about his disciple\u2019s late return. Luo Jianqing had secluded himself for half a year, though Xuan Lingzi was always in seclusion. He only came out to help with Luo Jianqing\u2019s cultivation questions. Other than that, he never stepped out the door.Luo Jianqing looked back at that closed door, then stepped into his own house.After seven days, all the large sects arrived together. Luo Jianqing and Zuo Yunmo entertained them outside.In total, there were three goals that these sects wanted to achieve. One was Tai Hua Mountain facing the demonic cultivators. The second was how to open up Liu Yan Valley. And the last one was Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s sect-wide competition that would take place in three days!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 19": "Chapter 19Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 019The best sect in the Xuantian continent was Tai Hua Mountain. Every seven years they hosted the sect-wide competition.As the number one cultivation sect, Tai Hua Mountain was not afraid of exposing its strength. Instead, they let the best of their young disciples freely display their superior strength, showing off Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s peerless radiance.In every sect-wide competition, every single great power in the land was sure to come up to the stage and make a congratulatory speech.This time, it was spreading like wildfire. The small powers sent their sect leaders or their great elders to lead the participants. As for those four sects, eight major families, and sixteen schools, they immediately sent a Calamity Passage stage elder to express their congratulations.As the outstanding talents of the young generation, Luo Jianqing and Zuo Yunmo had to shoulder the responsibilities of receiving the guests. After the outside cultivators officially checked into Tai Hua Mountain, Sir Hao Xingzi promptly gathered everyone there and spoke about their crusade against the demonic cultivator, as well as the matter of Liu Yan Valley.Such a serious matter was naturally nothing ordinary disciples could partake in, even though Luo Jianqing sat in the middle of Ling Yun Hall, serenely listening to the Body Fusion cultivators\u2019 argument with the almighty Out-of-Body cultivators. He came here as a representative of Yu Xiao Peak since Xuan Lingzi never involved himself with other matters like these. What\u2019s more, the demonic cultivator was merely at Nascent Soul stage, so he was not worried at all.The discussion surrounding the demonic cultivator did not last very long among the older generation, as they were more concerned about Liu Yan Valley.Liu Yan Valley opened every 50 years. Apparently, when the war between the two races began thousands of years ago, some heaven-rank fire-attribute demon master fell to Changzhou, forming Liu Yan Valley. For thousands of years after, Liu Yan Valley\u2019s fires never went out. Only cultivators below Nascent Soul could explore it, which was always a great opportunity for them.A heaven-rank demon master was equivalent to a Spirit-Refining stage human cultivator!With just another step, a heaven-rank demon master could become immortal and achieve a golden body.It was obvious that Liu Yan Valley was very important to cultivators.This time, Liu Yan Valley opened early, which naturally made many smaller powers furious. After a discussion that took place over a full day and night, Hao Xingzi finally wrote up a contract. The other representatives signed the contract and left some spiritual sense. At long last, everyone came to a consensus about the exploration of Liu Yan Valley.After the other sect leaders and elders left, only Luo Jianqing was left, until he heard Hao Xingzi say, \u201cJianqing, Liu Yan Valley\u2019s early opening is quite fortunate for you as well. If you don\u2019t take advantage of it, you will already have reached Nascent Soul stage and cannot enter again by the time Liu Yan Valley opens again in 24 years.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded. \u201cJianqing understands.\u201dHao Xingzi continued, \u201cRegardless, the timing of Liu Yan Valley\u2019s opening is also unfortunate. The young generation of Tai Hua Mountain are not yet fully mature, and we just happen to be lacking in resources right now. As the great senior brother, you must guide your junior brothers and sisters cautiously. Place importance on life above all else.\u201dAfter Hao Xingzi explained some more, he sent Luo Jianqing back.Just as Hao Xingzi said, Tai Hua Mountain was indeed lacking in resources for the time being. Among the disciples who were Core Formation and below, the highest cultivation was the middle stage Core Formation Luo Jianqing. He was very strong among this generation of disciples, but he had not cultivated long enough yet. Unfortunately, this meant that right when Liu Yan Valley opened again, there was no choice but to send them instead.After his return to Yu Xiao Peak, Luo Jianqing did not return to the bamboo house to cultivate, but took out Shuang Fu and went to practice in the bamboo forest.His pale white gown lightly fluttered in the sky, the light green of his sword mark resembling green jade, his elegance unmatched. Shuang Fu flashed with a bit of sword light. There seemed to be snakes of lightning swimming around it. Under the moonlight, it seemed to transform into refined jade, radiating with bright light.Luo Jianqing executed each move with perfect control, the sword energy rocking the green bamboo around him endlessly. The bamboo leaves scattered like petals to the ground, but the trees never fell. If someone watched carefully, they would perhaps discover that he was deliberately controlling his strength so that the sword light would only make the bamboo sway and not leave a single mark.Luo Jianqing\u2019s face was calm as he raised his sword in preparation. He practiced for an entire two hours.When he had just put back the sword technique \u201cTrue Nine-Petaled Lotus Record\u201d, he heard a cold voice behind him. \u201cYour heart is not stable, so your swordsmanship is not pure enough. Jianqing, the sect-wide competition is in two days. Are you going to show everyone Yu Xiao Peak\u2019s swordsmanship with this kind of strength?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s entire body was rigid. He immediately turned around and said with his head bowed, \u201cMaster, this disciple knows his mistake.\u201dSir Xuan Lingzi wore a white lapelled chang pao. His black hair scattered naturally, his level gaze aimed at his disciple in front of him. He starred seriously at him for a while, then suddenly stepped forward and grabbed the sword in Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand.Luo Jianqing reflexively gripped the handle tight. Xuan Lingzi said in a satisfied voice, \u201cGood, you still know to protect your sword.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded his head but didn\u2019t understand. His voice was suddenly caught in his throat just as he thought to say something.\u2014\u2014Too close.As if he had just taken a bath, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s long hair slid lightly, without any jade crown or headband to keep it in place, completely relaxed. His jet-black hair fell to the sides of his cold phoenix eyes, making his face even colder and tranquil, like cool water under the moon.The Tai Hua Mountain disciples liked to cause trouble, and there was always one disciple in the back joking, \u201cYu Xiao Peak\u2019s restrictions are necessary, Sir Xuan Lingzi\u2019s honor needs to be protected. I heard Feihua Sect of the \u2018Four Sects\u2019 has a great elder that secretly admires him. And don\u2019t even mention our great senior brother. If there were no restrictions, who\u2019s to say whether little senior sister will climb up the mountain for nightly attacks. I\u2019m afraid that many outside female cultivators wouldn\u2019t be able to control themselves either!\u201dYu Xiao Peak\u2019s brilliance not only lay in the master and disciple\u2019s strength, but also in their appearances.With the beauty of fair and perfect jade, they were so flawless and beautiful that it made one perfectly willing to comply.Luo Jianqing stared blankly for a time. Xuan Lingzi conjured some spiritual energy in his palm and took Shuang Fu into his hand. Luo Jianqing\u2019s first instinct was to seize his sword, but Shuang Fu shook twice with strong discontent. When Xuan Lingzi used just a bit of force, however, Shuang Fu submitted.Xuan Lingzi said, \u201cJianqing, watch carefully now.\u201d\u201cAt the very beginning, one petal will open, and when nine petals open, it will become the nine-petaled lotus.\u201dVoice falling, Xuan Lingzi raised the sword, and a luminous sword light surged forward.Under the moonlight, the honored senior with his black hair and white clothes danced lightly with the sword, his every move as if precisely calculated. The observer standing off to the side was so moved that a gasp left his lips without realizing. The sword light was a hundred times stronger than Luo Jianqing\u2019s earlier movement. In that bamboo forest, not a single bamboo swayed, and even the tips of the leaves were still and silent.Finally, the boundless sword light became a golden ray and shot straight towards Luo Jianqing, stopping a mere inch from his face.Xuan Lingzi returned the sword to Luo Jianqing, asking, \u201cJianqing, did you see it?\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded. \u201cYes, I saw clearly.\u201dXuan Lingzi said, \u201cThen do it again.\u201dWithout hesitation, Luo Jianqing lifted his sword. With the effort used to make a cup of tea, he withdrew his sword and looked towards his master. The latter knit his brows slightly, then suddenly took a step forward and pulled Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand!Luo Jianqing\u2019s entire body became rigid.With a hint of fragrance, Xuan Lingzi spoke quietly into his ear, \u201cYou are too worried.\u201dJust as his voice fell, Xuan Lingzi grasped Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand, still slowly guiding his sword.The burning warmth shot through his skin as soon as he made contact, spreading through all the blood vessels in his entire body. When Xuan Lingzi took his hand back, some unknown feeling rose in Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart. He blankly raised his head to look at his master, and realized with a start\u2026 that tonight, he seemed to be unusually gentle with him.Xuan Lingzi spoke softly, \u201cThere are still two days left, you need not worry. Do you know\u2026 what day it is today?\u201dLuo Jianqing stood dumbly, shaking his head. \u201cThis disciple does not.\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s lips slowly rose up, exposing a warm smile. \u201cToday is your birthday.\u201dLuo Jianqing was stunned speechless.\u201c36 years ago, I picked you up from the riverside. If a superior constitution is born, it is inevitable that it will occur along with a natural phenomenon. Back then, your parents left you at the riverside. I secretly gave them some silver and took you back with me. Now, 36 years have already passed. I found that a few days ago that your parents have died this year. Jianqing, would you like to go back and visit?\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled slightly. \u201cNo need, Master. Since you\u2019ve already broken off the connection with them for me, then all is life or death, I have no relationship with them.\u201dXuan Lingzi watched the handsome youth in front of him, his phoenix eyes drooping slightly. \u201cThat natural phenomenon was the heavenly lightning, and eighteen thousand li of the Luo River\u2019s water gradually clearing. As a result, I named you Luo Jianqing. (1) In those 36 years, were you ever curious about what different direction your life could\u2019ve taken?\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled brilliantly, unable to keep some softness from his voice. \u201cMaster, being with you is enough for Jianqing.\u201dThese words suddenly rendered Xuan Lingzi mute, staring at the handsome young man under the water-like moonlight. His fingers started to tremble, a hint of disorder also in his spiritual energy. Looking at this exceptional, elegant face, rolling flames seemed to roar in his heart, gradually becoming more unstable.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s expression suddenly chilled. \u201cYour master will spend your birthday with you this time, but after this year, you must never entangle yourself with mortal life again. Forget the world of mortals and henceforth dedicate yourself to becoming immortal soon.\u201dLuo Jianqing blurted out, \u201cHow could I ever forget that?\u201dXuan Lingzi paused for a moment. \u201cCut yourself off from worldly ties, and devote yourself to the Greater Paths.\u201dLuo Jianqing asked again, \u201cHow can I cut myself off?\u201dAfter being silent for a long time, Xuan Lingzi said, \u201cYou are already disconnected from mortal affairs. Henceforth it can be assumed that you have already cut off worldly ties.\u201dUpon hearing him, Luo Jianqing smiled instead. \u201cMaster, I have never done that. In my heart lays Tai Hua, second junior brother, third junior sister\u2026 and every elder and senior that protects me.\u201dHis words abruptly cut off at that point. Luo Jianqing lightly raised his bright eyes, which carried a brilliant smile. His gaze was locked on Xuan Lingzi as his voice rang clear and loud like he was speaking the sweetest words: \u201cAnd Master, you are there too.\u201dXuan Lingzi did not reply. His face remained cold as always, while Luo Jianqing kept gazing at him with a smile.After a while, Xuan Lingzi spoke, his sleeves fluttering, \u201cWe are definitely not part of your worldly ties. After you reach that cultivation level, you will surely understand.\u201dHis voice falling, Xuan Lingzi flew inside his bamboo house. Luo Jianqing felt only a gust of wind wrap him up and carry him into the bamboo house. Xuan Lingzi took a jade hairpin and gently pushed it inside Luo Jianqing\u2019s hair. His fingers fiddling in his hair made his head tremble slightly.\u201cThis is made from divine jade agate and contains one attack with sixty percent of your master\u2019s power. Jianqing, after you use it, it will become nothing more than a mere accessory. Use it wisely.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s eyes curved with his smile. \u201cYes.\u201dAfter that, Luo Jianqing combed Xuan Lingzi\u2019s hair for him and helped him tie his jade coronet.Supposedly they were celebrating his birthday, but throughout the entire night, the master and disciple did not speak much, only sitting on the side of the chessboard staring at each other. By the time the sky turned blue, Zuo Yunmo\u2019s voice could be heard from the base of Yu Xiao Peak, who was calling Luo Jianqing to help with the sect-wide competition matters.Luo Jianqing immediately rose and walked to the gate, but couldn\u2019t help turning around and asking, \u201cMaster, this disciple wants to know something. Have you cut off your worldly ties yet?\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s back faced the gate, looking right at the chessboard.After a very long time, just when Luo Jianqing thought he would be waiting forever for an answer, he heard Xuan Lingzi seem to sigh. \u201cYour master\u2026 has not.\u201dLuo Jianqing saluted and left, and the bamboo house resumed its state of quiet.Xuan Lingzi sat straight up on the bamboo couch, his gaze falling next to the chessboard. After a long time, he extended his hand and slowly caressed every chess piece Luo Jianqing had just left behind. His movements were as tender as could be, filled with love and memory. After his touch passed over the last piece, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s entire body shook and took back his hand as though he had just been burned.\u201cJianqing\u2026\u201d(1) \u6d1b: name of Luo River, surname\u6e10: gradual\u6e05: clearPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 020It was already the night before the sect-wide competition when Luo Jianqing was done checking the preparations.The sect-wide competition was just on the horizon. Zuo Yunmo was still unable to make a breakthrough, having no choice but to say to Luo Jianqing with a smile, \u201cThis is truly unfortunate, senior brother. I am but an inch away from breaking through to middle stage Core Formation. Only then can I fully enjoy myself when I battle you.\u201dLuo Jianqing lightly smiled as he spoke. \u201cJunior brother, even if you reach middle stage Core Formation, don\u2019t even think that you can challenge your senior brother\u2019s dignity.\u201dZuo Yunmo raised his eyebrows. \u201cIt seems someone\u2019s forgotten who was it that liked to sit on my shoulders as a child every single day\u2026\u201d\u201cJunior brother!\u201dZuo Yunmo smiled slightly and put his finger against his lips, hushing him.Luo Jianqing had a very stable temper and only thought: Tomorrow at the arena, I will make that shameless second junior brother know just how to write the words \u201cgreat senior brother\u201d!When night came, Luo Jianqing explained what happened on the second day to Xuan Lingzi. After confirming that he did not want to watch the competition, he felt a sense of disappointment, but he also knew that it was to be expected. The sect-wide competition was nothing more than a series of matches between disciples, and even his match with Zuo Yumo was just a battle between two Core Formation cultivators. How was that even worthy enough for Xuan Lingzi\u2019s eyes?But before Luo Jianqing left, Xuan Lingzi said neutrally, \u201cDo not make Yu Xiao Peak lose face.\u201dLuo Jianqing gave him his compliance and left.When night fell, the bright moon rose in the east.The quiet light of night enveloped all of Tai Hua Mountain. In the mountain forest, the cries of demon beasts could be faintly heard.The next day was the sect-wide competition, and many disciples spent the last night tossing and turning. Some people were meditating, wishing to stabilize their cultivation as much as possible; while some were continuously drilling their spiritual beasts to make sure they wouldn\u2019t forget; and there were others who were practicing against their fellow disciples, training their ability in actual combat.In the pitch-black night, a shadow flitted across Yu Xiao Peak and passed through the layers upon layers of restrictions, departing from the peak.Luo Jianqing sped between the mountain peaks, his entire body covered in black clothes for night travel. Besides a black cloth covering his face, he also took a second-grade Image Concealing Pill, which made any cultivator below Out-of-Body stage unable to discover his true appearance.Luo Jianqing was not worried at all about Xuan Lingzi being skeptical of his whereabouts. In his childhood, he and the rest of Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children would often sneak out in the middle of the night to play. In the beginning, Xuan Lingzi punished him by making him self-reflect, but there was one time he was punished more brutally than usual. Luo Jianqing had knelt at Xunjie Gate, refusing to acknowledge his errors no matter what. After he passed out, Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t care if he snuck out anymore.Luo Jianqing grew up knowing Tai Hua Mountain like the back of his hand. After he took a shortcut to Hao Ming Peak, he did not head for the inner disciples\u2019 residence, but instead walked to the outer disciples\u2019.At the moment, there were no lack of people who were secretly training inside. Luo Jianqing paid no attention to them and soon found who he was looking for.Obviously, the sect-wide competition will begin tomorrow. Obviously, with just his own strength, there was absolutely no way he was going to win the first match. Indeed Li Xiuchen was still sitting in the courtyard, face as stiff as a board. He was not cultivating, he was not practicing with others; he only continuously practiced with a dagger, an odd look on his face, and who knows what he was feeling inside.In his past life, after Li Xiuchen entered Tai Hua Mountain, Xuan Lingzi put his heart and soul into guiding him.Though Li Xiuchen had no constitution, Xuan Lingzi still persisted in getting Li Xiuchen to Phase Six Qi Condensation in a single year. Who would\u2019ve guessed that among the 24 new disciples, only two had reached Phase Six Qi Condensation, one of which who had a first-level constitution.That person\u2019s earnesty and attentiveness consumed Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart with hatred. Liu Yan Valley had also opened early in his past life. The Qi Condensation disciples were divided into early stage, middle stage, and late stage, all fighting separately. The last three champions were allowed to go to Liu Yan Valley first.It was no different from his past life. The only change was that Li Xiuchen was only at Phase Four.Actually, even Phase Four Qi Condensation was just too ridiculous. Li Xiuchen never practiced and did not have a master as good as Xuan Lingzi, but he still managed to reach Phase Four Qi Condensation. As Xie Zizhuo would say, that joker Li Xiuchen is definitely up to no good!Luo Jianqing had no idea how Li Xiuchen cultivated. After all, Xie Zizhuo had been sending someone to observe him since the beginning, but never saw any hint of hard work. However, Luo Jianqing did not care about this at all. In fact, he did not come here tonight to spy on Li Xiuchen.Thinking of this, Luo Jianqing hid and made his qi untraceable.After a cup of tea\u2019s worth of time, Li Xiuchen returned the dagger to his waist. He turned his head just in time to see a masked, black-clothed person standing right in front of him.Li Xiuchen\u2019s eyes widened with fright. Right as he was about to scream, he found that his voice was sealed.He only heard a hoarse voice echo in the courtyard, \u201cYou seem to stand nice and straight. I quite like you, so I will bestow you a magical tool to help you pass the sect-wide competition tomorrow. No need to thank me. Until we meet again, you will come to know who I am.\u201dFor a long time, Li Xiuchen\u2019s entire body was completely paralyzed. There was one more sword on the ground. Li Xiuchen still felt completely frightened as he was a moment ago. Don\u2019t even mention that person hiding their face; even if they had no face, Li Xiuchen still wouldn\u2019t be able to see them well in the night.Li Xiuchen finally stopped shaking. He crawled to the sword and picked it up.\u201cThe heavens have blessed me! This is the heavens\u2019 gift to me! I really am the main character! Hahahaha!!!\u201dOutside the courtyard, Luo Jianqing pulled the black cloth off his face and sneered, then flew away.The next day, the sect-wide competition that Tai Hua Mountain hosted every seven years began right on time.Tai Hua Mountain nowadays had a total of several hundred Qi Condensation disciples, around a couple hundred Qi Foundation disciples, and ten disciples at Core Formation. Among them were Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children, as well as three junior brothers who all painstakingly worked their way up to Core Formation stage.The arena was set up at the plaza in front of Cang Shuang Peak\u2019s Ling Yun Hall, while elders of the other sects could sit in front of Ling Yun Hall and watch the battles between the younger generation. This time, three Tai Hua Peak Lords arrived. Sect leader Hao Xingzi sat in the center of the crowd, leading the matches.There were four Out-of-Body elders who were in charge of the sect-wide competition, as well as twenty-odd Nascent Soul elders scattered all around the arena. In case something happened, they were right there to rescue anyone who needed help.Studying cultivation always involved danger to an extent. Anyone who made a full-out effort never broke their dedication.Therefore, in this sect-wide competition, there must always be an elder with a great cultivation level watching on the sidelines, or it may lead to great disaster.The very first matches were among the Qi Condensation disciples, from Phase One to Phase Three. Nothing made this sort of match worth watching. By the time all the matches were finished, there came a cry of alarm among the disciples \u2013 not for the little junior brother who won his victory, but for the seven people that appeared around the arena.Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children were here!Little senior sister Mu Tianxin was clad in fire-red; sixth senior brother Xiu Hen looked strong and sturdy, bold and powerful; fifth senior brother Huo Yuchong had a head of red hair with a fierce disposition; sixth senior brother Xie Zizhuo was covered in black from head to foot, fluttering his fan casually; third senior sister Wei Qiongyin held a sword as a spectator, her face cold as ice; second senior brother Zuo Yunmo was smiling softly, tender and approachable.And the one who walked at the very front seemed to harness all the splendor of the world, as dazzling as the stars in the sky.He wore a white uniform with green sleeves. A green three-petaled lotus adorned his forehead, a handsome face rivalled by none, eyes as beautiful as a painting. Every movement was beautiful and graceful. His expressionless face and calm, relaxed manner made the crowd part at once, while also making all the great cultivators in front of Ling Yun Hall suddenly think of one name.Luo Jianqing.Tai Hua Mountain, Yu Xiao Peak, Luo Jianqing.Even to an almighty Body Fusion cultivator, this name held a famous reputation.This was Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Yu Xiao Peak\u2019s only disciple. This was the last disciple of the number one cultivator, Xuan Lingzi.\u201cThis is Luo Jianqing?\u201d\u201cHe really does deserve to be at Tai Hua Mountain. Even if this youngster is only at middle stage Core Formation, I actually sensed an overpowering sword intent from him.\u201d\u201cSect leader Hao Xingzi, is Sir Xuan Lingzi not coming today?\u201dHao Xingzi had already prepared for this situation. Although his cultivation was higher than these people, he was currently speaking as the sect leader of Tai Hua Mountain. Hao Xingzi spoke mildly, \u201cYes, this is the great senior brother of our Tai Hua Mountain, Luo Jianqing.\u201dThey sighed with emotion once again. Even the Calamity Passage elders of the four sects, eight great families, and the sixteen schools never moved their gaze away from Luo Jianqing.At this moment in the middle of the arena, Luo Jianqing was watching the matches between the middle stage Qi Condensation disciples. There were several dozen in total who fought on stage. At last with a great wave of dust, the mediocre-looking young man had finally won. Even the judging elder was staring with shock and couldn\u2019t speak for a long time.After a moment, the judge yelled, \u201cThe middle stage Qi Condensation victor is Li Xiuchen, Phase Four Qi Condensation!\u201dAs soon as his voice fell, the disciples erupted into whispers. Xie Zizhuo smiled crookedly, and ran to Luo Jianqing\u2019s side, whispering, \u201cSenior brother, what kind of trick has he pulled now! He\u2019s won again, he\u2019s done it again! Six of his opponents didn\u2019t show up last time and only fought two matches. Even at the end he still beat a Phase Six Qi Condensation disciple. Can you believe it? I don\u2019t! There is definitely something up with that sword. Its power is unnatural!\u201dWhile he spoke, he thought of getting up to see what was going on with his body, but Luo Jianqing pulled him back down and admonished good-naturedly, \u201cFourth junior brother, this junior brother is already so critically injured. That sword of his is a magical tool, but since the judge hasn\u2019t stopped him, then it isn\u2019t illegal.\u201dXie Zizhuo cried out, \u201cThe heavens are so unfair!\u201dLuo Jianqing laughed quietly. \u201cJunior brother, you don\u2019t have to be so jealous of how lucky other people are.\u201dXie Zizhuo\u2019s eyes turned green with anger. \u201cI\u2019m jealous of him?\u201dLuo Jianqing firmly slapped Xie Zizhuo on the back of his head, making him stop running his mouth and shut up in shame. Still, he mumbled to himself, \u201cSenior brother, it\u2019s obvious you hate him too, what\u2019s the matter with you today?\u201dLuo Jianqing heard him and slightly smiled.Over there, Li Xiuchen whooped and hollered in celebration, but no one joined him. Even little Liu Xiaoxiao stood in the middle of the Qing Lan Peak disciples, staring at Li Xiuchen but giving no congratulations.Upon seeing this, Luo Jianqing smiled lightly, his eyes narrowing, and continued to look at the match on the arena.Soon, the Qi Condensation disciples\u2019 match came to an end. It was clear that many Qi Foundation disciples were missing, and it did not take long for their matches to end. Finally, there were only ten Core Formation disciples left to battle.Everyone\u2019s gaze was concentrated on the five arenas. Luo Jianqing flew to the stage, staring at the brilliant red-clothed girl across from him. His sleeves gently fluttered as he smiled, \u201cLittle junior sister, today\u2026 I won\u2019t be so polite.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although she was one of the Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children, she was the ninth to master core formation among the generation of disciples, so her strength was not so strong. No one would goof around in the competition among various sects. This time, Mu Tianxin happened to encounter Luo Jianqing. Even trying her best by playing all kinds of magic weapons and various elixirs, she did not cause any harm to Luo Jianqing.Even among the Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children, the gap of strength difference was large to such a point.When this fighting was over, Mu Tianxin pulled Luo Jianqing\u2019s sleeve, complaining in a low voice: \u201cFellow elder brother, you didn\u2019t make any concessions for me at all.\u201dLuo Jianqing responded in a helpless way: \u201cLittle fellow younger sister, I have already given you time to throw out your magic weapon Bombing Thunder, how can I further make concessions for you?\u201d He implied that he was able to end the fighting in much a shorter time. To save face for his fellow younger sister, he had tried very hard to let Mu Tianxin perform well.Mu Tianxin felt depressed and she pouted her mouth, turned around to not to see Luo Jianqing any more. It seemed that she was really angry. But when it was time for Luo Jianqing to come on stage for the second time, she still took out a bottle of elixirs from her Na Jie and put it into Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand, and said in a low voice: \u201cAnyway\u2026since I will not use it at the moment, you just take it for use.\u201dLuo Jianqing did not know whether to laugh or cry.This time, the disciple Luo Jianqing met on stage was not one of Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children.The ninth fellow younger brother had just stepped into the Golden Core Period for no more than one year. As he saw Luo Jianqing, he carefully made a salute. Before Luo Jianqing did anything to him, the ninth fellow younger brother stepped backward timidly. With a stumble, he just fell off the fighting stage by himself.Xie Zizhuo was stunned: \u201cOh, you the first fellow elder brother are so lucky! No wonder you\u2019re not jealous at all!\u201dLo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dIn front of Ling Yun Hall, the disciples following their elders to come to watch the fighting were also surprised by the sight of these scenes.In the first game against Mu Tianxin, they only saw Luo Jianqing taking defense for a long time, but finally he forced Mu Tianxin back with sword qi. And in the second game, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t even say a word after he was on his mark on the stage, but his opponent fell off by himself!\u201cThe first fellow elder brother from Tai Hua Mountain\u2026Is really as forceful as he was said to be?\u201d\u201cMy master has always been saying, luck is also a kind of strength. You see, the second fellow elder brother from Tai Hua Mountain, directly got a chance for a competition without fighting at all!\u201d\u201cI am ready for a big, exciting fight, but now\u2026\u201dAfter two rounds of competitions, those who were left on the stage were only Luo Jianqing, Wei Qiongyin and Zuo Yunmo who was lucky to get the chance for next round directly without fighting.The random order for Tai Hua Mountain this time was so awful that every time the strength gap between the two parties was very big. Not to mention those foreign friars, even the disciples of Tai Hua Mountain were confused, and it took only a few minutes to see who would win.Seeing that the foreign friars were discussing about it in a louder and louder voice, the disciples of Tai Hua Mountain grunted with dissatisfaction, and they began to cheer for their fellow elder brothers and sisters.\u201cCome on, fellow elder sister Wei! Fellow sister Wei, pull out your sword and show it to them!\u201d\u201cFellow brother Zuo is sure to win!\u201dYes, for this game of semi-final, fancy Luo Jianqing marching to the next round without a fight.Luo Jianqing helplessly walked off the stage, waiting for Zuo Yunmo to end his competition with Wei Qiongyin. The eyesight of disciples of other sects always turned to Luo Jianqing. In addition to the admiration and amazement at the beginning, in the eyes of the disciples of other sects, something unclear was there.Luo Jianqing did not care about it. He watched the fighting stage as he looked up.In this game, really you could feel the wind and cloud were surging, and it was different from the past fightings.When Wei Qiongyin pulled out the sword for the first time, Zuo Yunmo still had his sword sealed in the scabbard, smiling at Wei Qiongyin. The figures of two people turned into void on the fighting stage. After fighting for about half an hour, Wei Qiongying had blood at the corner of her mouth, which meant that she failed.Zuo Yunmo arched his hands and smiled, \u201cFellow younger sister, I\u2019m sorry for it.\u201dWei Qiongyin also cupped her hands to gesture back, going off the stage for healing with her face blue.At this moment, finally, all the disciples of other sects became silent. They held their breath to look at Zuo Yunmo on the stage and Luo Jianqing off the stage. Without letting them feel disappointed, Luo Jianqing quickly touched the ground with his feet, and deftly he floated on the fighting stage, smiled while saying: \u201cFellow younger brother, in the heart of fellow younger sisters and brothers, you have been a big hero now.\u201dZuo Yunmo showed ashamed smile on his nice-looking face. While shaking his head, he pulled the long sword out of its scabbard slowly. He said, \u201cFellow elder brother, I have been preparing for this fighting for seven years, and you need to be careful.\u201dWith those words said, overwhelming sword shadows fell on Luo Jianqing violently. The shadows of the sword closely blocked each way from which Luo Jianqing could get out. Shouting of amazement came from the audience from time to time, but standing in the middle of the sword shadow, Luo Jianqing was still quiet with his lips curled up. No fear could be seen on his face at all.\u201cThe first game of Qing Yang Sword formula, Scorching Sun Sword!\u201dZuo Yunmo constantly held the hand formula, and the Qing Yun Sword in his hands quickly flied to Luo Jianqing. Behind him, a red sun rose slowly, scorching the earth with heat, shining.Luo Jianqing ducked to avoid the overwhelming shadow of the sword, as if he had no time to care about the terrible sword tricks.The round sun finally rose completely from the horizon, instantly it turned into a fireball, fleeing to the constantly dodging Luo Jianqing.Outside the fighting stage, disciples felt that the temperature in the air suddenly rose. Many people even began to wipe sweat. In front of Ling Yun Hall, Sir Hao Xingzi touched his beard with satisfaction and lifted his hand to reinforce the boundary on the stage. Suddenly, the temperature dropped again.Seeing that round sun had gone toward and even pressed Luo Jianqing, who seemed to be burning into charcoal, in an instant, Luo Jianqing showed green light between his eyebrows before a sword with a length of about three feet seven inches appearing in his hands. The sword was glittering with the color of glaze. Luo Jianqing raised his hand without any moves and thus he stood in front of the round sun.Bang!A sword stopped the advance from the round sun, and in a moment, the hot sun was gone.However, at the next moment, Luo Jianqing suddenly went to the side in a flash, while a sword had been stabbed into the position where he was just now.Zuo Yunmo smiled with his sword in hand and said, \u201cFellow elder brother, be careful and never underestimate your enemy.\u201dLuo Jianqing kept calm, saying, \u201cFellow younger brother, you are the one who need to watch out.\u201dAs he said this, a crash of metal came out. Two people\u2019s figures almost became void. During the constant collision on the stage, even Wei Qiongyin could not see their movements clearly. The disciples from other sects also felt confused, only the elders in front of Ling Yun Hall sighed in amazement in unison.\u201cIs this the match between friars in the Golden Core Period?\u201d\u201cTai Hua\u2019s Seven Children live up to their name! Luo Jianqing definitely lives up to his name!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOn the fighting stage, Luo Jianqing touched the ground with his toes, calmly and easily he dealt with each attack given by Zuo Yunmo. He appeared to be very natural and unruffled. As Sir Xuan Lingzi said the night before, he didn\u2019t lose face for Yu Xiao Peak. However, as Luo Jianqing swung sword upward again, Zuo Yunmo smiled in a low voice.Luo Jianqing broadened his eyes, feeling not good in his heart. However, before he was able to step back, he heard that Zuo Yunmo said in a low voice, \u201cFellow elder brother, you were careless.\u201dAs soon as he said this, a vast blue sky came floating on the fighting stage.Hao Xingzi exclaimed in a low voice: \u201cYunmo has reached such a state?\u201dThe sky was getting wider and wider, with the majestic domineering momentum that would spread the whole fighting stage. The mighty righteousness fell down from the sky. Originally Zuo Yunmo had lost a lot of spiritual force in the fighting a moment ago, but now he got all of it back. It could be seen that under the blue sky, he stood there with his clothes fluttering, while vast spiritual force was released on the Qing Yun Sword.\u201cThe second formula of Qing Yang Sword formula, Qing Yun Sword!\u201dHardly had Zuo Yunmo\u2019s voice faded away, the sky actually fell to the body of Luo Jianqing .This offensive move agitated the boundary to tremble slightly, which made even Luo Jianqing narrow up his eyes and quickly pinch the hand formula, and Frost Floating Sword also excitedly came floating in front of him.The imposing manner in the void stirred up a wave of qi on the fighting stage, even Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help but step back for two steps to stabilize his body.At that moment the sky was about to press down, the Frost Floating Sword suddenly turned into a Nine-handle Sword, which whirled to prick into the void.\u201cOne sword turns into nine lotuses!\u201dSuddenly a great mass of dark clouds came up in the sky, which covered the blue sky. The clouds were heavy, and the thick thunder came down, which followed the Frost Floating Sword to go away, and joined the Qing Yun Sword in mid-air.For a moment, with thunder and lightning there, the sky and thunder made a collision!Hao Xingzi hurriedly waved his sleeves to strengthen the boundary.Seeing that a burst of smoke come up on the fighting stage, the mass nervously looked at it, only to find that the handsome fellow elder brother in white clothes, with blood at his fingertips, panting heavily, and in front of him, Zuo Yunmo, who was smiling a moment ago, spouted a big mouth of blood, and he staggered backward for more than ten steps. Fortunately, with the support of Qing Yun Sword, he did not fall down.Luo Jianqing pinched his fingers where the blood flowed down, saying, \u201cFellow brother, please admit that you are defeated.\u201dSmiling, Zuo Yunmo raised his lip corners and muttered while seeing the youth in white in front of him with a gentle look, \u201cHow can I admit defeat in this way?\u201dAs soon as he said this, a piece of void was seen to rise again. Luo Jianqing looked at the scene with horror and said in a rush: \u201cMy fellow younger brother, you will become spiritually exhausted.\u00a0 Is it necessary for you to do so? \u2026\u201d\u201cI will spare no effort, fellow elder brother. And \u2026 Didn\u2019t you Jianqing say that we must go all in?\u201dLooking at the smile on Zuo Yunmo\u2019s face, Luo Jianqing suddenly was shocked there.Luo Jianqing looked up at the vast expanse of blue sky. With his eyes narrowed, suddenly, he had his five fingers pointed to the ground, and an invisible force came out of the palm of his hand. The force broke through the barrier for the fighting stage with irresistible vigor. In face of the Sirs of Ling Yun Hall, it just turned aside ashamedly, but in the face of those disciples, it just went directly through them.This force was frantically seizing all the living creatures within a mile of the summit of Cang Shuang Peak.Countless starlight that ordinary people could not see flew up from the sky and gathered to the body of Luo Jianqing. These forces with the arrogance of the stars flew away in front of the eyes of Hao Xingizi, though the latter was completely unaware of it. Sir Hao Xingzi was still holding his breath to look at the scene on the fighting stage.The next moment! Luo Jianqing\u2019s breath began to increase, 10 percent, 20 percent, 30percent \u2026 When he returned to his prime, the surged breath did not stop there, but continued to pile up in a crazy way!The elder transcending tribulation of Duan Hun Sect was amazed, so he asked, \u201cWhat Kongfu is this?\u201dHao Xingzi tightened his eyebrows and said, \u201cWhat Jianqing practiced is the supreme Kongfu of Tai Hua Mountain, True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record.\u201dThe mass immediately understood, \u201cIt was the True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record as heard before\u201d, no wonder it was so wonderful!\u201dLuo Jianqing had his palm hit the ground, and a handprint of as long as ten meters appeared on the fighting stage.\u201cCapture spring and autumn!\u201d\u201cOne sword turns nine-pedaled lotus!\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s sword turned into a green lotus that quickly stabbed into the sky.Bang! Bang! Bang!Bright dazzling sword light pierced the sky, toughly piercing the blue sky into countless fragments. That momentum thundered up, hitting the boundary beside the fighting stage. Everything was completely transformed in the blink of an eye. The boundary suddenly broke, and the vast sword qi went directly towards the audience.Hao Xingzi narrowed his eyes, stomped on the ground, thus the boundary appeared again outside the fighting stage, which stopped the spread of the sword qi.After the loud rumble, on the fighting stage, Luo Jianqing showed a pale face, while Zuo Yunmo had flied out in an inverted way. He passed out completely, covered with blood all over his body.Luo Jianqing immediately came forward to see, and the fellow younger sister also hurriedly took elixirs to feed into the mouth of Zuo Yunmo. In a moment, the people of Qing Lan Peak carried Zuo Yunmo out.Silence reigned the ground.The disciples from other sects and Tai Hua Mountain looked at the friar in white clothes with horrified eyes.After a long time, judge elder shouted like waking up from a dream, \u201cThe Golden Core Period winner is Luo Jianqing, who is in the middle stage of Golden Core Period!\u201dIn one day, the final result of the big competition among various sects was spread all over Tai Hua Mountain. When the elders of other sects took their disciples away, there were still many foreign disciples looking at the elegant and handsome fellow elder brother from Tai Hua Mountain with great care. They could not believe that such a good-looking man could actually weild such a terrible killing power.Although Luo Jianqing also got some injuries, compared to Zuo Yunmo, his was only a small injury. After seeing all the guests off, he was asked by Sir Hao Xingzi to go to Ling Yun Hall, and was told to cultivate himself well, for in seven days they would go to the Liu Yan Valley.Luo Jianqing said YES to Sir Hao Xingzi before he flew back to the Yu Xiao Peak.This time, Xuan Lingzi did not continue to close his door for cultivation. He wore white clothes that were quite similar to Luo Jianqing\u2019s. With a complex golden pattern embroidered at the sleeves, he had his both hands crossed with each other at his back. Standing at the edge of the cliff, he raised his hand to have a look at the sky.Seeing this, Luo Jianqing was a little shocked. He said respectfully, \u201cMy master.\u201dXuan Lingzi was still standing on the edge of the cliff. The wind whipped up his robe and made a sound of hunting.Luo Jianqing just stood behind Xuan Lingzi. Without knowing how long it took before he heard an indifferent voice ringing out gently: \u201cJianqing, in the Kongfu competition among various sects today, how did you hit your second fellow younger brother into serious injury?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay(1)What Xuan Lingzi said was like a slap on the face to Luo Jianqing.Throughout the entire Tai Hua Mountain, even the Master, Sir Hao Xingzi knew nothing about the\u00a0True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record\u00a0and the whole thing happened at the time when Xuan Lingzi was in closed door training. That\u2019s why Luo Jianqing dared use the\u00a0Nine Heavenly Seizure Record. However, Xuan Lingzi was questioning him now about how he won.Struck dumb, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t know how to reply.After a while, Xuan Lingzi said again in a casual tone, \u201cAccording to the Master, you performed One Sword Turns Nine-pedaled Lotus, which was a skill could only be mastered by people who are in Nascent Soul Period. Have you mastered it already? Show me. I want to see you perform it.\u201dLuo Jianqing, whose back was now covered in cold sweat, felt relieved upon hearing those words. He took out Floating Frost Sword and skillfully performed One Sword Turns Nine-pedaled Lotus. The Floating Frost Sword turned into nine cyan lightnings, each thrusting into the mountain opposite of Yu Xiao Peak. All of a sudden, the mountain exploded with flying rocks and splashing sands.Back in the grave of Sir Bei Dou\u2019s, Luo Jianqing was not good at performing it. However, as he further studied\u00a0Nine Heavenly Seizure Record\u00a0during the past six months, he found that the spiritual power in his body was much different from thirty years ago.Usually speaking, Luo Jianqing was going against natural law, so he could not absorb spiritual power from heaven and earth any more. However, after practicing\u00a0Nine Heavenly Seizure Record, he felt a wonderful power in his meridians which empowered him to sweep across the world with such force that placed almost everything, including vegetation and the change of four seasons under his control. In a way, he had usurped the power of the universe over these things!With this sweeping power, Luo Jianqing was able to grab spiritual power from the universe.That\u2019s right! Not receiving it but grabbing it from the universe!Nine Heavenly Seizure Record\u00a0was against the natural law. It was about conquering the world!Luo Jianqing had come to master the First Seizure of the\u00a0Nine Heavenly Seizure Record\u00a0over the past six months, but despite all his efforts he had put into, he just couldn\u2019t master the Second Seizure. Every time he tried to perform it, he always came up short at the final step. Nonetheless, the First Seizure had allowed Luo Jianqing to use\u00a0One Sword Turns Nine-pedaled Lotus\u00a0free from the inhibition of time realms with incredible aim.Looking at this, Xuan Lingzi nodded in satisfaction. After offering some advices, he retreated back to the closed-door training in his bamboo house.Standing in the moonlight with the sword in his hand, Luo Jianqing stared at the locked bamboo house with mixed emotions, his eyes gradually growing darker and darker. Then, he squinted his eyes and went back to his own house to resume training.Seven days later, Luo Jianqing got words from the Master, instructing him to go to the Liu Yan Valley.This time, Zuo Yunmo didn\u2019t go with him, as performing the Qing Yun Sword for the second time and the injury he suffered at Luo Jianqing\u2019s hands had taken a heavy toll on his health. Though Zuo had gotten much better, Sir Hao Xingzi didn\u2019t see fit to send his disciple on another risky venture to the Liu Yan Valley.In the early morning, Luo Jianqing packed his bag into Interspatial Ring. Hardly had he opened the door and stepped out when he saw a slim figure standing in front of his house. Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart skipped a beat and wondered how long Xuan had been here.They simply stood quietly in front of the bamboo house, no one uttered a word.The sound of the breeze rustling through the green leaves in the bamboo forest sounded like a piece of lively music.After a while, Luo Jianqing decided to step forward, saying \u201cMaster Xuan, I\u2019ve just heard from Sir Hao Xingzi that we are to follow Master Shan and head to the Liu Yan Valley in Chang Zhou.\u201dXuan Lingzi acted as if he had not heard anything. It was only after Luo Jianqing repeated his words again that he whispered, \u201cJianqing, how are you doing with the\u00a0True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record?\u201dLuo Jianqing froze for a moment.Xuan Lingzi looked to him with piercing eyes and said calmly \u201cFor the likes of us, sword skill is not as important as the fundamentals and how strong a connection you have with your sword. Liu Yan Valley is a dangerous place. Since you are determined to go there, I would give you something as a gift to help you with your journey.\u201dLuo Jianqing exclaimed, \u201cMaster Xuan?\u201dWith a wave of his sleeve, Xuan Lingzi suddenly placed his hand around Luo Jianqing\u2019s waist and together they turned into a streak of light and flied out of the Yu Xiao Peak. After gently putting Luo Jianqing on the top of side peak besides Yu Xiao Peak, Xuan Lingzi stood between Yu Xiao Peak and the side peak.Wearing a white robe with wide sleeve, Master Xuan slowly walked mid-air to the middle of the two peaks.Luo Jianqing watched his movement with baffled look on his face. He had a rough idea about this gift. Whenever the little sister went out on adventures, Sir Yu Qingzi usually gave her a lot of advanced magical items and precious elixirs in hope that she could return unharmed.But Luo Jianqing had been on adventures for countless times and never did he get any magic weapons from him.Even though Xuan Lingzi had never explained that to him, Luo Jianqing understood that it was because his Master value self-cultivation more than fancy items.But now, Xuan Lingzi was offering him a magical item?While Luo Jianqing was still in the state of confusion, Xuan Lingzi had already positioned himself in between the two peaks. The roaring wind whistled through the mountain gaps, blowing up Xuan Lingzi\u2019s long and pitch-black hair as well as his robe which was now fluttering in the air. Suddenly, he turned to Luo Jianqing with a celestial smile on his handsome face.Across the distance, Xuan Lingzi said, \u201cLet me play you a piece of music to aid your cause.The moment he finished those words, a burst of music rang through the air.Duang!Astounded, Luo Jianqing watched what happened in front of him with bugged eyes.Xuan Lingzi crooked his finger as if plucking an invisible string and immediately a tremendous spiritual power rushed out, bouncing back and forth in between the two peaks. Luo Jianqing came to the edge of the cliff and looked down. Between the two peaks, every golden streak of the spiritual power was glistening under the sunlight like numerous golden strings.\u2014 Making a Chinese zither out of a mountain and a string out of the spiritual power!Xuan Lingzi was standing mid-air high above the sky from where the melodious music rang like heavenly sound.In between the mountains, the sound turned into tangible things, such as flying cranes, whirling ribbons and auspicious clouds above the sky.The wonderful sound echoed around the entire Tai Hua Mountain. All the disciples stopped to listen carefully to this unfamiliar rhythm. The trainers who were struggling to make a breakthrough suddenly saw things clearly. The most quick-minded of them even made it straight to the next level. Even Sir Yu Qingzi, who preferred to make elixirs alone in the Tai Hua Mountain, was intrigued to come out from his house and looked at the direction of Yu Xiao Peak with surprise.\u201cWho is this blessed man that Xuan Lingzi is playing his Yu Xiao zither for?\u201dLuo Jianqing closed his eyes, trying to savor the indescribable feeling at this moment.He heard how the flowers bloomed and withered. He heard the joyful conversation between fish and shrimp in a stream. He heard every gust of wind rustling through the leaves. He also heard the sighs of all lives as they grew and prospered.Through the blooming yellow flowers, one perceives the ultimate wisdom, and among the thriving bamboos the Buddha reveals himself to the world.The Second Seizure of the\u00a0Nine Heavenly Seizure Record, Seizing Lives!Luo Jianqing was like being struck by a thunderbolt as he finally understood the supreme power that was the Second Seizure!As the music came to its final ending, all the golden strings surged upward to the high sky, and then down they came, spreading all over the land right beneath the Tai Hua Mountain. Countless monsters rushed out from their caves to bathe in this golden aura; many fairy grasses also swayed their bodies with joy. After they absorbed the golden light, their spiritual power was further more strengthened.Standing at the center of this golden light, Luo Jianqing felt invigorated with a gush of refreshing energy seeping into his body through his every pore. He was in a state of bliss as the mild spiritual power gently passed through his meridian.When this music finished, Luo Jianqing opened his eyes and looked up. Xuan Lingzi, who was still standing in the air, waved his sleeve and the spiritual strings between the peaks suddenly vanished into thin air.Xuan Lingzi suddenly appeared in front of Luo Jianqing after taking only a few steps away from where he stood a while ago, a thread of golden light flashing across his fair eyes. As powerful as Xuan Lingzi was, he looked a bit pale with a sheen of sweat on his forehead.Luo Jianqing looked up at him while he was looking down at Luo.After a while, Xuan Lingzi gently tapped Luo somewhere in between the eyebrows with one finger.Luo Jianqing suddenly felt a burning sensation and before he could react, Xuan Lingzi turned back quickly, placing his hands behind his back and said in a casual tone: \u201cThis stroke of energy will follow you into the Liu Yan Valley. Jianqing. If you don\u2019t step up your practice, I will know it.\u201dLuo Jianqing was mesmerized, his lips trembling with emotions. He had a lot to say, but in the end he swallowed all those words.After giving a bow, Luo Jianqing flew away.Not long after Luo Jianqing left, Xuan Lingzi, who had been showing his back to Luo the whole time, suddenly took a stumble and almost fell off the cliff. Then, a flash of light swept across the sky. It was Sir Yu Qingzi, who asked with a smile: \u201cBrother, why did you suddenly play zither today? What\u2019s happened to you?!\u201dXuan Lingzi simply dismissed his questions by a wave of his hand. Yu Qingzi then generated tens of thousands of threadlike spiritual powers and sent them into Xuan\u2019s body.A second later, Yu Qingzi exclaimed with widened eyes: \u201cHalf primordial life! I dared not believe it when I heard from Hao Xingzi that you split half of your primordial life to support Jianqing\u2019s previous training and was therefore badly wounded. That was barely a year ago. How dare you split it in half again? You are\u2026.\u201d\u201cSister, say no more.\u201dYu Qingzi flew into a rage and yelled, \u201cThat is Liu Yan Valley. It\u2019s not some little grave of Nascent Soul trainer. The half of your primordial life is deprived of substance and you are greatly diminished. Your strength might have already been reduced to that of the Da Sheng Period, or worse, the Tribulation Period. Should you find yourself in trouble there, there is no guarantee that you will be able to get out. Brother, with only half of your primordial life, even you will be in mortal danger!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXuan Lingzi, whose face was as pale as a sheet of paper, did not reply until Yu Qingzi suddenly yelled, \u201cJianqing hasn\u2019t gone far. Let\u2019s take back that half primordial life\u201d. Hearing that, Xuan Lingzi mustered what strength he had left to stop Yu Qingzi by standing in front of her.Looking as elegant as ever, Xuan casually said, \u201cSister, he is my disciple. If you dare do anything to him without my consent, I will make sure your disciple Mu Tianxin would pay the price.\u201dYu Qingzi widened her eyes in astonishment and for a while words escaped her.A quarter of an hour later, a group of disciples followed Master Shan and left the Tai Hua Mountain.It was a long way from the Tai Hua Mountain to the Liu Yan Valley. Even with the help of Master Shan\u2019s flying tool, it still took them ten days to arrive at the Liu Yan Valley. At that time, many cultivators had gathered there. Some were from famous schools, but most of them were rogue cultivators.When the Liu Yan Valley was open, anyone below the Nascent Soul level could get in. But for most rogue cultivators, the chance of getting precious items there was really slim, as most of them usually couldn\u2019t survive the experience. Those from various schools, on the other hand, usually teamed up to improve their odds, and so they usually got the bigger prize.After Luo Jianqing and the others made it to the Liu Yan Valley, Master Shan quickly found his way to the only tavern in the town and took away the number plate that read Tai Hua Mountain.The lord of Liu Yan Valley ran this tavern exclusively for travelling cultivators. Even though the tavern had not been open for fifty years, this one-time operation could bring enough profits to sustain it for another fifty years. Every time they opened, they would have rooms reserved for cultivators from \u201cOne Mountain, Four Sects, Eight Clans and Sixteen Schools.\u201d What few rooms left were to be distributed among rogue cultivators through fierce competition.As the Tai Hua group entered the tavern, the masters of the Four Sects came up to greet Master Shan and together they began a joyful conversation. In the meantime, Luo Jianqing started arranging accommodation for his fellow disciples. He gave each female disciple a single room, whereas two or three male disciples were to share a room. Even himself was no exception, as he had to share a room with Xie Zizhuo due to the lack of available rooms.Upon hearing this arrangement, Xie Zizhuo quickly waved his hand and said, \u201cBrother, why don\u2019t you have the room for yourself? I have something to talk with little Nineteen anyway, and so I thought maybe I could crash over there together with him and little Eighteen. Isn\u2019t that right? Little Nineteen?\u201dThe little Nineteen snickered, \u201cYeah, Brother Luo. Brother Xie and I have a lot to talk to each other.\u201dLooking at their wicked smiles, Luo Jianqing raised his eyebrow and said, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. But you must not go out at night.\u201dXie Zizhuo suddenly put on a downcast face and said \u201cBrother, we hardly get a chance to come down the mountain. How could you ground us?\u201dLuo Jianqing replied with a sneer, \u201cYou really think I don\u2019t know what you guys are up to? Don\u2019t cross the line, otherwise your master will be informed.\u201dXie Zizhuo and others were immediately disheartened after hearing what Luo Jianqing said.Meanwhile at the other side, Master Shan was still talking with the four masters of Zoarium level. Then, after entrusting Luo Jianqing with the rest of the affairs, he went upstairs to exchange information of Liu Yan Valley with other masters. They discussed about how they would find that evil cultivator of Nascent Soul level and kill him after all the disciples were inside the valley.Luo Jianqing sat everyone down and ordered a few dishes for them to eat. Though the likes of them could live without eating grains when they reached the Foundation level, the food ingredients this tavern served were the best and so one could hardly say no to those dishes.Like the saying goes, you get what you pay for. Luo Jianqing found those dishes to be quite appetizing and couldn\u2019t help but eat a few more.Hardly had they finished eating when they heard clanking sound coming from the lobby. While Xie Zizhuo and the other curious disciples were looking at the direction where the sound came, Luo Jianqing was still busy picking up food in front of him with lowered head. Then a soft voice broke the air, \u201cSo, there is no more room available?\u201dThe man spoke in a slightly high-pitched voice that sounded both feeble and feminine. He ended each word with a slightly raised voice, just like a feather brushing over people\u2019s hearts.Xie Zizhuo exclaimed in a low voice \u201cBrother, I wonder if there ever exists such a pretty man like this one. He is as beautiful as a woman!\u201dAs soon as he finished those words, a gust of wind whizzed towards Xie Zizhuo.Xie Zizhuo was for a while struck dumb. Luo Jianqing raised the chopsticks and caught a flying needle. That man chuckled \u201cWhat an impudent man. The man beside you are more beautiful than me. Why don\u2019t you make any comment on him?\u201dLuo Jianqing looked up at him.Wearing a scarlet robe embroidered with dark red texture, that man held his hair with a white jade hairpin. He fixed his flirting gaze on Luo Jianqing with his pretty, curved eyes. What with his red, seductive lips and his slim body, this man looked very much like a woman from all possible angles. However, it was impossible to fool a cultivator over something as basic as one\u2019s gender.This was a man, or rather, a man whose appearance was as delicate as a woman.Xie Zizhuo finally come to his senses. As a feared cultivator of the Tai Hua Mountain, he had never been treated like that. With a thump on the table, he growled, \u201cWhat do you mean? My brother naturally looks better than you, but he is not in any way as sissy as you.\u201dThat man squinted his eyes and tried to say something. Before he could open his mouth, Luo Jianqing spoke up in a casual tone \u201cIt\u2019s my brother\u2019s fault. He shouldn\u2019t have talked about you like that, but you used a poisonous needle. Don\u2019t you think that\u2019s too much?\u201dThat man in the red robe sneered, \u201cWell, pretty. Your brother said I was a sissy.\u201dXie Zizhuo wanted to talk back, but Luo Jianqin stopped him before he could finish the word \u201csissy\u201d.Moving his fingers, Luo Jianqing cast the needle back, which immediately turned into a beam of light and flied towards its owner. Seeing this, that man in the red robe raised his sleeve to retrieve the poisonous needle. Luo Jianqing then clasped his hands to make a salute and said, \u201cI apologize to you on behalf of my brother, but you also have to explain what you just did with the poisonous needle. Although you are a late-stage Gold Core expert, Tai Hua Mountain would never be bullied.\u201dThat man asked in an odd voice \u201cTai Hua Mountain?\u201dLuo Jianqing replied, \u201cExactly. What do you say to that?\u201dInstead of being infuriated by those words, that man laughed. He looked Luo Jianqing up and down with a pair of seductive eyes. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t care about this rather insolent behavior, but others like Xie Zizhuo were irritated. Wei Qiongyin even took out his sword, looking furiously at that man.The man in red laughed and said, \u201cBy the look of you, you must be Luo Jianqing, the eldest disciple of the Tai Hua Mountain and the core disciple of Sir Xuan Lingzi, Right?\u201dLuo Jianqing ignored his question and asked, \u201cWho are you?\u201dMo Qiu.\u201dLuo Jianqing froze for a moment, and the man in red leaned his body against the table and continued, \u201cMo Qiu of the Mo Clan.\u201dLuo Jianqing turned his head to Wei Qiongyin, but Wei Qiongyin shook his head and said, \u201cThe Wei Clan aren\u2019t on friendly terms \u00a0with the Mo Clan in the past. I don\u2019t know much about them, brother.\u201dThe Eight Clans were ranked under the Tai Hua Mountain and the Four Sects and they included the Bai Clan, the Yun Clan, the Cang Clan and the Mo Clan; the Que Clan, the Yu Clan, the Wei Clan and the Geng Clan.\u201dThe Bai Clan was the most powerful of the Eight Clans with two ancestors of the Da Sheng level. The Mo Clan was also one of the top four clans with an ancestor of the middle Da Sheng level. Although Luo Jianqing knew those who were the best among the younger generation of the Eight Clans, he had never heard of the name Mo Qiu before and fancy him being a late-stage Gold Core expert, no less.By the look of him, his spiritual bones must be well under fifty years old. Were he known to the cultivation world, people would definitely label him as a genius.As if seeing right through Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind, Wei Qiongyin whispered, \u201cBrother, the Mo Clan has a lot of branches. I have heard that one branch committed a crime and was sent in exile to the cold wasteland. They are stipulated to stay there until they reach the Nascent Soul level. Maybe this Mo Qiu is one of them.\u201dHearing that, Luo Jianqing slightly nodded and then turned nonchalantly to Mo Qiu. He casually said, \u201cYour apology, sir?\u201dObviously surprised by this question, Mo Qiu mumbled, \u201cMy apology?\u201dLuo Jianqing said in a cold voice, \u201cSeeing as you are the one who delivered the lethal blow, you owe us an apology. If you don\u2019t apologize, then I am afraid there must be a fight.\u201dHearing that, Mo Qiu curved up his lips and smiled, \u201cPretty, are you sure you want to fight me? You are a middle-stage Gold Core expert.\u201dLuo Jianqing raised his eyebrows, \u201cSo you won\u2019t apologize?\u201d\u201cWhat a joke. Anyone who thinks he can comment on my appearance and survive the experience is a moron. That said, seeing as he is a disciple of the Tai Hua Mountain, I will let him go this time. If I ever see him again, I would skin him alive and \u2026\u201dA beam of green light suddenly sprung up from the floor!Mo Qiu\u2019s retort was cut short by this sudden attack, and immediately he formed a scarlet whip on his hands. With a sweep of the whip he managed to block Luo Jianqing\u2019s onslaught.As the clash between the sword and the whip dragged on in this little tavern, spiritual energy kept colliding with each other, sending waves upon waves of energy out into the air.Just when the dispute between Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu started to flare up, some perceptive rogue cultivators had already stayed clear of them. Those disciples from the four sects were watching from the sidelines. The four cultivators of the late Gold Core level had been observing Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu since the beginning. Now that the dispute had turned into open conflict, they squinted their eyes, carefully assessing the situation.There was a succession crisis going on at the Tai Hua Mountain. In contrast, the younger generations of the four sects and other schools were in a much better shape, with virtually all of their best disciples being the late-stage Gold Core experts. Those four were the eldest disciples from the four sects.The green light projected from the sword was freezing cold and every slash of the scarlet whip was meant to kill.Those two were locked in a dog fight with neither side gaining obvious advantage. However, Xie Zizhuo was not worried, as he knew that although his brother was a middle-stage Gold Core expert, he could very well make up for it with his Nascent Soul skill. Cultivation base was important, yet what constituted a cultivator\u2019s basis was his strength. Sir Hao Xingzi had said a long time ago that Luo Jianqing\u2019s supreme spiritual bones had given him unparalleled strength, allowing him to kill those who were above his level.However, as time passed, those four onlookers all knitted their brows, watching cautiously at both Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu. Xie Zizhuo was very much astonished, as he didn\u2019t expect a man from a branch family of the Mo clan could fight Luo Jianqing to a tie.Slap!Slash!Luo Jianqing wobbled a bit and came to a halt. There was a trail of lash mark on his face.On the other side, Mo Qiu was panting with a slash wound on his left arm.They all looked at each other with cold eyes. After a while, Mo Qiu broke an untraceable smile and said, \u201cThis is the first time people try to force me to apologize.\u201dLuo Jianqing raised his sword and pointed it at his forehead, \u201cYou want to do this again?\u201dMo Qiu squinted his eyes to observe this young man in white like a cobra looking at its prey. After a long while, he sneered and turned to Xie Zizhuo, \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have used that poisonous needle. My bad. But the next time your little friend sees me coming, he had better go the other way. I\u2019ve never spared anyone before. You\u2019d better \u00a0not antagonize me again.\u201d\u2018What a condescending bastard! You didn\u2019t win over there!\u2019 Xie Zizhuo wanted to talk back, but he was still muted by Luo to utter a timely rebuttal.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter finishing that, Mo Qiu was about to turn back and leave. \u201cCultivator Mo, now that everything is sorted out, why don\u2019t we forget about this unpleasant business and make up? I understand there is no room available for you. We have a spare room. You can have it if you like.\u201d said Luo Jianqing in a casual .Little Nineteen exclaimed, \u201cBrother, I thought we have run out of rooms. You\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing said, \u201cI can sleep over with others. That\u2019s all right.\u201dHearing that, Mo Qiu fell into silence, all the while looking at Luo Jianqing with a smile.Looking calm, Luo Jianqing said, \u201cCultivator Mo, what do you say?\u201dMo Qiu asked instead: \u201cAre you bribing me?\u201dLuo Jianqing ignored his question.Mo Qiu laughed, \u201cHow interesting. The Tai Hua Mountain and Tai Hua disciples. Hahahahahha. Fine, I accept your invitation. But you don\u2019t have to crash with others, I can share the room with you.\u201dUpon hearing those words, a glint of dim light flashed across Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes yet he remained silent.After the meal, Luo Jianqing led Wei Qiongyin somewhere outside to ask about the Mo Clan. After hearing the things about the Mo Clan, the eyes of Luo Jianqing gradually grew darker. At last, he laughed, \u201cI see. I didn\u2019t know that the Mo Clan was the leading clan of the Eight Clans in the ancient times.\u201d Then they returned to the tavern.That night, Luo Jianqing made a bed on the floor. Seeing that, Mo Qiu asked with a twisted smile: \u201cLittle pretty. Do you think I\u2019m a bad sleeper or are you frightened that I might harass you in the middle of the night?\u201dLuo Jianqign replied nonchalantly in a cold tone, \u201cIt\u2019s me. I\u2019m the bad sleeper.\u201dMo Qiu laughed.In the midnight, Luo Jianqing was still wide awake. With his robe on, he lay on the floor gazing at the ceiling and was reminded of something that happened long time ago.In his previous life, after he learned the death of his two little brothers, he risked returning to the North for revenge. But he only found Zuo Yunmo\u2019s sword tassel. What\u2019s worse, he was also attacked by many cultivators from the righteous factions. Wounded as he was, he was simply no match for those assailants and so he fled into a valley.It was easier to get in than to get out.Luo Jianqing was not as fortunate as Li Xiuchen. After Luo fell into the valley, he did not find any magic treasure or medicinal plant, but a skeleton and a letter written in blood. The letter indicated that this corpse was a cultivator of the Mo Clan. Having failed the mission, he knew that his kin would definitely be isolated and even slaughtered by others of the Mo Clan.The letter didn\u2019t reveal why the other branches of the Mo clan would be so furious by what this man did that they would hold his kin responsible. But the letter harbored such an implacable hatred, that, even after thousands of years, can still be felt when Luo Jianqing read it.\u201cMy sin had nothing to do with my descendant. Please help them, in return I would give you all my magic treasures, medicinal herbs and all my belongings.\u201dLuo Jianqing didn\u2019t find any magic treasures and medicinal herbs. All he could find was a skeleton in front of him. However, Luo Jianqing owed him a debt of gratitude, for in order to regain his strength, he had no choice but to absorb all the remaining spiritual power in that skeleton by performing an evil cultivation skill.This senior cultivator was an immortal stage expert. Even his bones contained tremendous power, but after the spiritual power was absorbed, the bones turned into a pile of ash and drifted away with the wind.Before he left, Luo Jianqing kneeled and kowtowed three times in front of the blood letter. He swore to himself, \u201cIt\u2019s my fault that your skeleton has gone with the wind. Given the chance, I will find your descendant and I would do my utmost to protect them.\u201dThat senior cultivator was a member of the Mo Clan. According to Wei Qiongyin, a branch of the Mo Clan had been exiled to the cold plain for over tens of thousands of years.If it was true, Mo Qiu would probably be the descendant of that senior cultivator.Although that happened in his previous life, Luo Jianqing still couldn\u2019t forget the fact that it was the senior cultivator\u2019s skeleton that gave him the chance to get out. It was one thing that he forced Mo Qiu to apologize to Xie Zizhuo and the Tai Hua Mountain, but when it came to his previous commitment to the senior cultivator, it was another story all together.\u201cBut\u2026. who took the magic treasures and medicinal herbs\u2026.\u201d\u201cLittle pretty, what are you saying?\u201dSurprised, Luo Jianqing looked up and saw Mo Qiu, who was looking at him from the side of the bed with a smile on his pretty face. Luo Jianqing found his smile odd as it didn\u2019t look like one should be showed to his peer, but rather an amiable one an elder would show to a junior cultivator.However, from a worldly perspective, Luo Jianqing was indeed a junior compared to Mo Qiu, as he was more than a dozen years younger than him.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t reply. He closed his eyes and asked, \u201cCultivator Mo, are you going into the Liu Yan Valley?\u201dMo Qiu grinned, \u201cso, are you going inside, too? For Tai Hua Mountain, the opening of Liu Yan Valley is simply too good an opportunity to miss.\u201dLuo Jianqing asked, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you go inside with the Mo Clan? I heard that Mo Feng, the third eldest son of the Mo Clan had come this time and he would be followed by the other members of the Mo Clan.\u201dMo Qiu remained silent.But Luo Jianqing had figured out why.His family had been exiled for tens of thousands of years, and so possibly this time he went behind his family\u2019s back and sneaked out to the Liu Yan Valle. Since the Mo Clan wouldn\u2019t accept him, he wanted to get in as a rogue cultivator.Thinking of that, Luo Jianqing said, \u201cCultivator Mo, how about joining us? Even if you can\u2019t get many magic treasures, at least you will have a better chance at getting out alive.\u201dMo Qiu gave an inconspicuous smile and suddenly asked, \u201cLuo Jianqing of the Tai Hua Mountain. Why are you being so nice to me? What do you want?\u201dLuo Jianqing froze a bit. When he opened his eyes, he saw Mo Qiu pulling half of his body away from the bed and staring right at him from a distance of less than three inches.As astonished as he was, Luo Jianqing struggled to remain calm. After a while, he said, \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it, just forget it.\u201dInstead of an immediate reply, Mo Qiu looked at the sword texture on Luo\u2019s glabella, and finally fixed his eye on a little cinnabar mole. Mo Qiu asked, \u201cYou have a cinnabar mole on your glabella?\u201d\u201cHmm,\u201d muttered Luo Jianqing instead of giving him a direct answer.Before Mo Qiu removed his gaze, he took a few more looks out of curiosity. Then he said, \u201cI am used to be a rogue cultivator. There is no need to worry about me. I\u2019m a late-stage Gold Core expert, and so I will have no trouble getting out alive.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t keep persuading him. After all, he had had a tiring day, and he gradually fell asleepThe next day, when Luo Jianqing opened his eyes, Mo Qiu had already gone. He noticed a few spiritual stones on the table, and when he picked them up, he found a piece of paper. Seeing this, Luo Jianqing put on a smile in resignation.Did Mo really think he would like to sleep on the floor all night for a few stones?If not for the gratitude he felt towards the senior cultivator, he would have made Mo Qiu pay for what he had done yesterday.The next day, before all people got ready to enter the Liu Yan Valley, Wei Qiongyin found Luo Jianqing and told Luo some information he learned yesterday.There was indeed a genius disciple named Mo Qiu, and he was the descendant of those who had been exiled to the wasteland. Once he reached the Nascent Soul Level, he would be accepted by the Mo Clan. He \u00a0also made a name among the younger generation of the Mo clan, but he had been living in the wasteland all the time and never showed himself in the thirty-six states.Thinking about that, Luo Jianqing said, \u201cMo Qiu is only a hair\u2019s breadth away from the Nascent Soul. I\u2019m afraid his arrival at the Liu Yan Valley was an attempt to break through the Gold Cord level. Once he reaches the Nascent Soul stage, he would be accepted by the Mo Clan and he would not have to go back to the isolated wasteland.Wei Qiongyin nodded in agreement.The disciples of the Tai Hua Mountain were ready to go. Early in the morning, they followed Master Shan to the plain outside of the Liu Yan Valley.At that time, tens of thousands of rogue cultivators had already been there, and countless small schools had also sent their best disciples. They were not after some big, magic treasures, a little experience to help with their cultivation would do.Following Master Shan, Luo Jianqing greeted people from the Four Sects, Eight Clans and Sixteen Schools. When he met Mo Feng, Luo Jianqing looked at him up and down, and then he asked, \u201cCultivator Mo, do you know Mo Qiu?\u201dMo Feng was a rather muscular man and he replied with a frown, \u201cMo Qiu is a member of one of our branch families living in the wasteland. I\u2019ve heard about your conflict with him. Allow me to apologize to the Tai Hua Mountain on his behalf. But I don\u2019t know him that well. He has been living in the wasteland before. I\u2019m afraid this is the first time he has come to the thirty-six states.\u201dLuo Jianqing agreed with a nod.After two hours, the gap between the gate was wide enough for a man to get through. After sweeping a look at Li Xiuchen, a disciple of the Tai Hua Mountain, Luo Jianqing slightly squinted his eyes and flew to the gate.Meantime, all the cultivators flew to the gate at their fastest speed. All of them wanted to be the first one to get in.Luo Jianqing was the fastest among them. He got in as quickly as he could. Seeing that, Master Shan touched his goatee with satisfaction. On the other side, the Master of the Duanhun Sect complained \u201cYou are the closest to the gate, so you are the first to get in. Let\u2019s see. The second must be one of our men.\u201dBefore he could finish his words, a scarlet figure flew into the gate.The master was stunned with his mouth wide open.Master Shan was also stunned for a while, and then he laughed, \u201cHow about that? Elder Liu, I knew that man. He is Mo Qiu, and he was defeated by our eldest disciple, Luo Jianqing. He was forced to apologize to us in the tavern yesterday. Look, your men can\u2019t even compete with a rogue cultivator.\u201dTwitching his mouth, the master of the Duanhun Sect almost fainted.The Liu Yan Valley was now officially open. Thousands of cultivators rushed in to compete for the ultimate prize!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLiuYan Valley located on the north of Chang state, which occupied one tenth of its vast territory. \u00a0So it would take 10 days at least to fly around the wholeLiu Yan Valley even for someone who resorted to the Earth-level flying Magic Treasures. In this case, the people here seldom met a soul even he walked outside all day.Luo Jianqing told Tai Hua\u2019s disciples the location before they came in the Liu Yan Valley and emphasized that everyone must go that way so that they could gather again in the finally. If anyone of them dared to disobey it, the offender would get severe punishment, from \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0being locked in the Admonition School to being kicked out of the Tai Hua directly!Thus, after Luo Jianqing firstly made it to the destination, he was joined by \u00a0Wei Qiongyin just after half a day.Within three days, all the disciples arrived there, includingLi Xiuchen who came unwillingly with a long face.Luo Jianqing gave a glance on Li Xiuchen\u2019s face and then he looked around, saying, \u201cAmong all the people who came in the Liu Yan Valleythis time, only nine people were from the Tai Hua mountain in total. As I knew, there are ten people who already reached the late-state gold core, especially the disciples of Duan Hun Sect, Yan Su who even had the cultivation of half Nascent soul period.Therefore, the disciples who are in Foundation level need to find their opportunities by their own under the premise of paying attention to the danger. As for the disciples of Qi refining period\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing made a pause for a second and then looked at Wei Qiongyin and Xie Zizhuo who stood near him saying with a smile, \u201cJunior sister and brother, considering the high rate of death of the cultivator of Qi refining period in the Liu Yan Valley, I suggest that each of us \u00a0should take one disciple to protect their life. Of course, about the Magic measure, it depends on their own fate.\u201dWei Qiongyin answered and agreed.But Xie Zizhuo curled his lips and said,\u201dOh, come on, Senior bro. If it wasn\u2019t that the second senior brother couldn\u2019t come here, I didn\u2019t want to come to the fucking Lou Yan Vally at all! Yet I showed up despite all the unwillingness harbored in my heart \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0! Don\u2019t tell me that I need to take a useless partner with me! Please remember, I\u2019m the senior brother of all the deciples here \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0!\u201dEveryone\u2019s attention was focused on Li Xiuchen.Among these three disciples who were in the Qi refining period, two of them were from Cang Shuang Peak and Bi Can Peak, only Li Xiuchen was from Hao Ming Peak. So what XieZizhuo meant was quite obvious. Li Xiuchen was the disciple from Haoming Peak, but the Big Brother of Hao Ming Peak said he was the senior brother of everyone, which obviously contained an undertone of refusing to \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0be forced to take Li Xiuchen for the adventure.Luo Jianqing said graciously,\u201d So junior brother, you take care of the junior sister who is from Cang Shuang Peak.\u201dXieZizhuo giggled, \u201cSenior brother, thanks.\u201dLuo Jianqing did not reply to him, \u201cJunior sister, then you will take the junior brother from Bi Can Peak. As for the junior brother from Hao Ming Peak, you just follow me.\u201dLi Xiuchen stepped back a little bit unconsciously, after looking at Luo Jianqing\u2019s smile, he had no other options but to nod.Luo Jianqing looked at him with a smile. Soon, they split into six groups to look for their opportunities. The persons who were in Foundation Level \u00a0each made one group by their own, and each of the three disciples who were in Gold Core Level formed a group with one disciple who was in Qi refining period.The junior sister from Cang Shuang Peak saw Luo Jianqing\u2019group leaving in a flying boat, swallowed with envy, saying in a low voice, \u201cSpending one year at the Liu Yan Valley with the Big Brother, how lucky that guy is!\u201dHearing what she said, XieZizhuo suddenly stared directly at her,\u201d Junior sister, isn\u2019t it good to stay with me?\u201dOnce opening, Liu Yan Valley would keep open for three days. After three days, the door would shut down again and after one year, it would send the survived adventures \u00a0out automatically.After hearing what XieZizhuo asked, the junior sister who was in the ninth level of the Qi refining period lowered her head out of \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0shyness, saying in a low voice, \u201cSenior brother you\u2026\u2026are also very good. But everyone in Tai Hua Mountain knows that the Big Brother stays at Yu Xiao Peak all the time, we barely see him. Plus, he is\u2026\u2026\u201d She flushed ever scarlet \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and continued, \u201cThe Big Brother is so handsome and powerful that lots of female disciples in Tai Hua Mountain admire him. I am\u2026\u2026I am one of them.\u201dXieZizhuo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter a while, XieZizhuo was unwilling to give up, saying,\u201d I may not as handsome as the Big Brother, but I am also good-looking.\u201d Then, XieZizhuo swung the folding fan open and asked, \u201cBesides, I am in the first-stage Gold Core Leveland am the Big Brother of Hao Ming Peak. Junior sister, am I qualified\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s different. Senior brother, the Big Brother is the God in our mind.\u201dXieZizhuo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dIt seemed that she did not notice XieZizhou was frustrated, the junior sister clasped \u00a0her hands tightly and positioned them on her chest,\u201d Do you know there is a folk song in Tai Hua Mountain?\u201dXieZizhuo stopped for a second and then he laughed with a weird look in a sudden, \u201cDid you mean that piece of\u2026\u2026\u201dThe junior sister nodded immediately, \u201cYes, that is a folk song for the Big Brother.\u201dXieZizhuo burst into laughter and switched on his blanket-type flying device to take the junior sister to set off. While flying, he said on purpose,\u201dJunior sister, make sure you sing this folk song to the Big Brother after you meet him after one year.\u201dThe junior sister was very confused, \u201c\u2026\u2026?\u201dXieZizhuo and the junior sister were the last to leave the gathering place. Meanwhile, Luo Jianqing had already driven the flying boat for more than 10 miles.Luo Jianqing was meditating and cultivating in the flying boat, paying no attention to Li Xiuchen. He did not worry Li Xiuchen would do anything to him, not only because Li Xiuchen was only in fourth level of the Qi refining period, but he also knew Li Xiuchen did not remember the fact that he wanted to kill him in the secret place.Li Xiuchen\u2019s memory was erased by some powerful person. He felt suspicious of Luo Jianqing\u2019s identity, but he did not know any fact of any consequence.Thus, Luo Jianqing was cultivating hard without worrying anything else. After they entered the second layer, Li Xiuchen knocked his door open and said,\u201d Big\u2026big brother, we have entered into the second layer area.\u201dLuo Jianqing opened his eyes, looking at him with a smile, and asked, \u201cSo junior brother Li, are you suggesting \u00a0\u00a0we should stop?\u201dLi Xiuchen asked confusedly, \u201cBig Brother, what did you mean by \u2018should stop\u2019?\u201dLuo Jianqing said, \u201cIt is also my first time entering LiuYan Valley. I know there are so many opportunities in here, but it won\u2019t be easy to find them. Most people coming to Liuyan Valley for the Yan Fruit, which contains pure spiritual power from the Heaven level demons Master of the fire. It is said to contain a bit of the Fire Principle. We human beings cultivate the Dao, but the demons cultivate the Principle. There are many Fire Fruits in the Liu Yan Valley, but the valley is too big, it is possible that we cannot find even one Yan Fruit within hundreds of miles.\u201dLuo Jianqing looked up at Li Xiuchen indifferently and asked,\u201d Junior brother Li, do you think you can find the Fire Fruits if we go down only at the second layer?\u201dLiuyan Valley is a ladle-shaped dangerous place, with the circle of the edge to be the first layer. From the outside to the inside, there are nine layers in total. It was said there was a fire river in the core, with flames glowing. As thus, in the Liuyan Valley, the flames and force would get stronger as the layers getting to the core, and accordingly, the Yan Fruit would become easier to come by.Li Xiuchen said,\u201d There may not be any Fire Fruits in the second layer and this area is too huge. Senior brother, can we stop at the fourth layer?\u201dLuo Jianqing raised his eyebrows and asked,\u201d Why?\u201dLi Xiuchen said,\u201d The fourth layer is in the middle, but not too close to the core. I think the enemies we meet there will not be very powerful, but we still can obtain the Fire Fruits.\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled and nodded to agree.Before leaving, Li Xiuchen rolled his small eyes and could not help but to ask, \u201cSenior brother, you really don\u2019t know\u2026what television is?\u201dLuo Jianqing was very surprised and asked, \u201cIs it some kind of demon?\u201dLi Xiuchen shook his head and directly left. Walking in the corridor in the flying boat, Li Xiuchen talked to himself in a low voice, \u201cSeems like he is not transmigrated from the future, which means after I come, the butterfly effect has been so strong that the whole plots have been changed dramatically. However, I have to follow the plots sooner or later, after all he is one Boss in the beginning of this novel.\u201dLuo Jianqing did not totally understand what Li Xiuchen was saying, but he could tell Li Liuchen did not suspect his identity and he could feel there was an unconscious killing intent while he was talking.Others might not know to whom this killing intent was pointed, but Luo Jianqing knew clearly as long as he recalled the time he was killed by that sword in his last life.A cultivator who was in the fourth level of Qi Refining Period wanted to kill the one who was in the middle-stage of the Gold Core Period, what vain hope it was!Others might think it was ridiculous, but Li Xiuchen\u2019s tone was firm and not a touch of hesitation could be sensed \u00a0.Because he was the main character of the book,\u00a0Seeking Immortality.Luo Jianqing took out the book and read through the last chapters once again.This book ended in the Liu Yan Valley, which said Li Xiuchen had obtained a lot of treasures in the valley before returning to the Tai Hua Mountain. As a cultivator who was only in the Qi Refining Period, Li Xiuchen escaped from dangerous conditions for so many times and he ran into quite a few natural treasures . In the end, he found a blood-colored fruit which was still burningThat blood-colored fruit was the goal of Luo Jianqing for this time.It was not the Yan Fruit, but it contained huge energy. Only absorbing a tiny bit from its energy, Li Xiuchen\u2019s cultivation base increased from the sixth level to the eighth level of the Qi Refining Period. Besides, the book said Li Xiu Chen hid this fruit which was very useful in the future.Luo Jianqing was determined to get the blood-colored fruit.It was not only to snatch \u00a0\u00a0the treasures of Li Xiuchen, but also to help himself to increase his cultivation base, so he could be much closer to that person!\u201cIf I was also in the Deity Transformation Period, then how would you deal with it? Wuyin.\u201dLuo Jianqing had been in the \u00a0state of \u00a0cultivation in isolation for three days, trying to reach the second level of the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record.The first seize of Nine Heavenly Seizure Record was to seize the plants and the weather.This enabled every plant in this world to be away from the control by the Heaven. Why did catkin fly in the spring? Why were flowers withered in the autumn? These were the rules regulated by the Heaven, but after seizing the plants and the weather, these plants could improve their cultivation base or become weeds all by their ability.As to those rules which were seized, Luo Jianqing had a feeling that after he cultivated to a certain status, he might be able to make the rules.The Heaven created the rules and ordered the whole world to obey them. Then, why couldn\u2019t he be the one to make the rules?While the second seize of the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record was to seize lives, which meant to seize the unfairness prevailing all living creatures.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayInjustice prevailed in the law of nature. While mayfly only lived for one day, Dragons or Demonic Beasts were born with the cultivation equivalent of the Eighth Rank. It should be equal among all the creatures in the world, and no one could outlive the others. There was no difference of lowliness or nobleness between human beings and distinct species ever, even the smallest insect living in the drain was also life.This was the real Tao of the Heaven \u2014 All the creatures were equal.And the secret of seizing lives actually meant seizing the unfair rules of every life.Luo Jianqing sat on the stone bed and meanwhile, he formed a sign incessantly. Soon, an invisible power emanated slowly and then it turned into long strip dancing in the air lightly inside the small boat. The power seemed like it had the special Spiritual Sense and played naughtily around Luo Jianqing.But soon they stopped slowly with the Sense sounded from Luo Jianqing\u2019s mouth.Suddenly, a blue light explored from Luo Jianqing\u2019s forehead and a trefoiled blue lotus showed with bright lights.With the cultivation of a cultivator who cultivated the True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record increased, a tattoo of the lotus would appear on his forehead. After Luo Jianqing stopped cultivating the True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record and turned to cultivating Nine Heavenly Seizure Record, then the tattoo on his forehead became a small trouble for him. But unexpectedly, the trefoiled blue lotus still existed on his forehead even he cultivated the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record.The only difference was that the blue lotus now became more vivid, shining some spiritual lights faintly.Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes were closed tightly while some blue spiritual lights appeared from his figures. Around the spiritual lights, the invisible power began to spin and formed a small whirlpool. Soon, the whirlpool got bigger and bigger and then finally broke the limit space of the boat, extending quickly.\u201cEven a yellow flower contains its Prajna, even a blue bamboo owns its Dharmakaya.\u201d\u201cThe Tao of Heaven has its own way, and where is it? In the Equality of All Sentient Beings, in the Constancy of all creatures!\u201d\u201cThe Second Seizure of the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record, Seizing Lives!\u201dIn an instant, terrible spiritual energy exploded suddenly from Luo Jianqing and spread around uniformly. As the first thing that the spiritual energy reached, Li Xiuchen who stood on the boat was immediately wrapped up by the invisible power like a cocoon. However, at the moment when the power tried to seize his natural law, a lot of spiritual lights showed on Li Xiuchen.The power stopped for a while and then released Li Xiuchen helplessly, leaving disdainfully after it gave a flick of its long strip to Li Xiuchen.Of course, Li Xiuchen knew nothing about what was taking place right now. Standing still on the boat, he looked at the Liu Yan Valley with a curious look.After this, the power flew toward the Liu Yan Valley quickly and swept countless low-level Demonic Beasts, even a fifth-layer Demonic Beast was included! In this world, one fifth-layer Demonic Beast owned the same cultivation of a cultivator in the Gold Core. And some fifth-layer Demonic Beast with spiritual sense even could talk. As the only Demonic Beasts that could feel the invisible power, it struggled crazily.However, no matter how hard it struggled, resplendent starlight still flew away from the fifth-rank Demonic Beasts after the time for a cup of tea, being absorbed by Luo Jianqing\u2019s body immediately.With his eyebrows drawn together tightly, the blue light on Luo Jianqing was getting brighter and brighter.His cultivation increased so greatly that he immediately reached the level of full middle-stage of Gold Core, which just one more power needed and he could reach the late-stage Gold Core easily.The Second Seizure of the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record, Seizing Lives, he finally cultivated!\u2026.The flying boat kept flying forward. No matter where it arrived, the invisible power swept everything along the way and every single place it reached, the invisible power would absorb all the natural law of the creatures, leaving no exception. What\u2019s more, it never gave up on watching Li Xiuchen with its covetous eyes (if it had eyes), wondering how to absorb all his natural law successfully.But it couldn\u2019t, considering his powerful natural law which even could be seen from one hundred kilometers away.Due to the influence of invisible power, a lot of cultivators who just arrived the Liu Yan Valley found that during this time, many Demonic Beasts and spiritual plants had undergone some things against the law of the nature, such as the Dark Sands Snake which should be born with third rank cultivation, but now they were in the second rank cultivation! And the Black Fire Flower which would never reach the fourth layer, but now they did!\u201cMaybe it\u2019s because of the difference of the geographical conditions between the Liu Yan Valley and others?\u201dNo one could explain it.Seven days later, Luo Jianqing and Li Xiuchen arrived on the fourth layer of the Liu Yan Valley.Luo Jianqing took the flying boat back to the Interspatial Ring, and then they stepped on the hot sands and stones, walking on the Liu Yan Vally step by step.Due to his low cultivation, Li Xiuchen was very glad to walk with Luo Jianqing since it would help a lot if he got Luo Jianqing to rely on. But meanwhile, he still remembered the day when he came into the relic of Sir Bei Dou, Luo Jianqing ordered someone to cover his mouth and fixed his body with a spell, which was really a shame! Therefore, now as the only person he could count on right now, Li Xiuchen still kind of fear him.But after getting along with him for some days, Li Xiuchen realized surprisingly that maybe Luo Jianqing forgot it.One time, Li Xiuchen asked Luo Jianqing carefully, but Luo Jianqing asked him back with a surprised look, \u201cSo it was you, the junior brother at that time?\u201dActually, it made sense. Back then, he thought Luo Jianqing was also a person who transmigrated to this world like him, so he sent out a few cautious feelers and as return, he was kicked by Luo Jianqing for several times. And then when they were in the relic of Sir Bei Dou, maybe he had said something wrong so Luo Jianqing punished him as his Senior brother.So in fact, Luo Jianqing was not so bad to him, at least, Luo Jianqing treated him better than Xie Zizhuo.Thinking of this, Li Xiuchen\u2019s perspective on Luo Jianqing changed. After being bullied by many persons in the Hao Ming peak, Li Xiuchen had learned how to forbear his anger. Ten times Xie Zizhuo provoked him, Li Xiuchen could ignore him for two times. It was great progress, right?Li Xiuchen said, \u201cBig brother, how about we take a break here?\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled, \u201cOkay.\u201dLook! What a nice easy-going person compared to Xie Zizhuo!Luo Jianqing acted normal and calm like he had no desire about the Magic treasures in the Liu Yan Valley and just kept cultivating. If Li Xiuchen asked him to stop for a rest, he stopped. And if Li Xiuchen told him that it was the time to go, he followed. Therefore, Li Xiuchen gradually relaxed and let down his guard against Luo Jianqing.But along the way, Luo Jianqing saw many Yan Fruit.It was a bit wired since they couldn\u2019t find even one Yan Fruit although they had searched it for three days before, now they found eight Yan Fruits within one day!Luo Jianqing was quite generous with these Yan Fruits. He did not take any of those which Li Xiuchen was able to reach and he only took whichever Li Xiuchen was unable to reach.This made Li Xiuchen feel more grateful to him. He even decided to totally let go of \u00a0the fact that Luo Jianqing kicked him on his face and gagged him.There was even one time Li Xiuchen whispered \u201cI will try my best to defeat the BOSS as fast as I can in the future\u201d at midnight.Li Xiuchen did not know that Luo Jianqing\u2019s hearing was much better than a normal Gold-Core-Period cultivator, even better than many Nascent-Soul-Period cultivators. Even if Li Xiuchen did not make a sound, only blowing out air, Luo Jianqing still could understand what he was saying.After more than one month\u2019s walk, the two had found many treasures. Li Xiuchen looked at Luo Jianqing gratefully, while Luo Jianqing was very calm.Li Xiuchen appreciated Luo Jianqing. But Luo Jianqing knew that even he gave a small part of the treasures he encountered to Li Xiuchen, the gain of this month was more than what he had obtained within half a year in his last life.The Heaven\u2019s Way was never fair. Li Xiuchen stopped to have a rest, and just like that he secured a Yan Fruit after stepping on the sand. However, Luo Jianqing had to kill a five-level demonic beast to obtain one Yan Fruit.After walking for another three days, the two finally encountered people from Duan Hun Sect.Unlike Tai Hua Mountain, the disciples of which divided into different groups in order to find more opportunities, the disciples in Duan Hun Sect all stayed together. The cultivation base of their leader Yan Su was Half Nascent Soul Period. So when he appeared in a sudden, Luo Jianqing opened his eyes and raised his head to look at him.Their eyesight met in the air.After a long time, Yan Su greeted him while cupping his hands as a salute:\u201d Fellow cultivator Luo.\u201dLuo Jianqing followed suit:\u201d Fellow cultivator Yan.\u201dYan Su asked:\u201d It looks like fellow cultivators from Tai Hua Mountain were separated to look for the opportunities in small groups? \u201dLuo Jianqing kept quiet with a smile, not answering his question.Meanwhile, a female, wearing a blue cheongsam, who was standing next to Yan Su suddenly started to talk with a high-pitched voice:\u201d Senior brother, I saw that guy picked up one Yan Fruit and then dug out of one Yan Fruit from the sand.\u201dThe eyes of disciples from Duan Hun Sect were focused on Liu Xiuchen, who was standing next to Luo Jianqing.Luo Jianqing also looked at Liu Xiuchen with surprise.\u2026Liu Xiuchen only went out for a walk for 15 minutes, and he had found two Yan Fruits?!The nine people from Duan Hun Sect were all staring at Li Xiuchen, the female in blue said with jealousy that Li Xiuchen was only in Qi Refining Period that he did not deserve to own this many Yan Fruits. But Yan Su waved his hand to discontinue her, and he took one step forward and asked:\u201d Fellow cultivator Luo, may I ask how many Yan Fruits do you guys have?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s face clouded up after he heard his question.While Yan Su added:\u201d I know my question was rude, but I have to tell you, we, nine people from Duan Hun Sect, have been looking for two months, only finding four Yan Fruits.\u201dInstead of being angry, Luo Jianqing started to laugh: \u201cIs it related to me that you have only obtained four Yan Fruits?\u201dYan Su said:\u201d Fellow cultivator Luo, I have been always looking up to you, the first disciple of Tai Hua Mountain. But junior sisters and brothers risked their lives to enter Liu Yan Valley. In Liu Yan Valley, it is common to kill a person and seize the treasure. There is even a rule which says that all conflicts will be considered as it has never been happened after you are out of Liu Yan Valley. Tai Hua Mountain and Duan Hun Sect have both signed the contract\u2014\u2014In Liu Yan Valley, life and death are pre-ordained, and riches and honours come from God.\u201dLuo Jianqing replied indifferently: \u201cSo?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayYan Su said sincerely, \u201cIt seems that he got the God blessed and gained many Yan Fruit without being noticed as well. Brother Luo, I promise you that Duan Hun Sect\u2019ll never be your enemy in the Liu Yan Vally\u2026\u201dBoom!Blue sword energy suddenly burst up and rushed toward Yan Su. It happened so quick that Yan Su took out his Ghost Axe to meet the sudden attack immediately, heedless of finishing his words.Meanwhile, Luo Jianqing took out the Floating Frost Sword and then kicked Li Xiuchen away from him, running forward to Yan Su.Yan Su raised his Ghost Axe up and met the attacks. Just within a breath, they had already exchanged several moves.Yan Su tried to be a nice guy and persuaded, \u201cBrother Luo. Such a disciple in the Qi refining period doesn\u2019t worth you to fight against me.\u201dLuo Jianqing laughed out, \u201cDo you think that I\u2019m doing it for him to fight against Duan Hun sect??\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Yan Su nodded.With a cold sword light hewed out, Luo Jianqing said angrily, \u201cAs a disciple of Tai Hua, I\u2019ll bow down to no man, let alone the person like you! For the fame of Tai Hua, I must make you apologize for what you did!\u201dNo one could threat the disciples of Tai Hua!Both of them kept fighting in the air. The long sword crashed with the huge axe, splashing metal sparks. At this time, there were eight people coming to Li Xiuchen and Luo Jianqing hewed them down with one stroke of the sword, forcing them to stop. Yan Su\u2019s fellow disciples were they.Yan Su\u2019s face changed and said coldly, \u201cBrother Luo, don\u2019t tell me that you want to fight against 9 people alone.\u201dLuo Jianqing stepped forward and crooked his finger, then the Floating Frost Sword flew back to his hand.He smiled indifferently, \u201d So what?\u201dStanding on the yellow sands under the burning sun, in a blue gown, he was so eye-catching with a cold long sword in his hand and confronting a group of 9 persons.\u00a0One man guarded the pass, ten thousand were unable to get through!\u00a0The intimidating Qi from Luo Jianqing forced them to lower their head subconsciously, even Yan Su who had the cultivation of the full late-stage gold core dared not to look at him directly.Next second, they fought against each other at the same time after the short silence!With a cold sword-light flashed, the right hands of three disciples in the Foundation level from Duan Hun sect were shot directly so that they lost their fighting strength for a while. And the other three disciples in the Qi refining period hadn\u2019t joined the war yet. Therefore, for now, only two disciples in the early-stage gold core and Yan Su stood in front of Luo Jianqing.\u201cThe Heaven Separated Ghost Axe!\u201d\u201cThe thunderbolt of the sword!\u201dOf course, this fight basically could be said as the fight between Luo Jianqing and Yansu.However, although as Sir Hao Xingzi said before that no one under the cultivation of Nascent Soul Period could beat Luo Jianqing, Yan Su also reached the level of a half step to the Nascent Soul Period. With the assistant of two cultivators in gold core level who would plot against Luo Jianqing as some time, Luo Jianqing was slowly at a disadvantage and suffered many injuries.Now, a lot of dark light gathered on Yan Su\u2019s huge axe and many ghosts flew out. The sky turned into dark slowly blowing the cold wind. With the scary screaming, countless ghosts rushed toward Luo Jianqing quickly. Luo Jianqing\u2019s pupils shrank and flew up immediately.\u201cSeizing the seasons!\u201d\u201cOne Sword Turns Nine-pedaled Lotus!\u201dNine blue sword-lights showed and formed a blue lotus formation, thrusting the countless ghost in front of him. After the blue lotus formation dashed against the ghosts, they engaged each other in a battle. And meanwhile, Yan Su gritted his teeth and spat out mouthful blood, which successfully increased the power of the ghosts on the Ghost Axe.At this time, another two cultivators in the gold core of Duan Hun sect were running toward Luo Jianqing from each side together!Luo Jianqing\u2019s forehead oozed sweat slowly, but he didn\u2019t have enough power to stop their sneak raids. At the moment he decided to end in common ruin with his enemies and resort to the Second Seizure of the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record at the cost of all his spiritual energy, he suddenly heard a sound breaking the wind of a spiritual power coming from a distance.\u201cAh! It hurt!\u201d\u201cWho is it!\u201dThe red blood whip pierced the shoulder of an early- stage gold core cultivator and got through the palm of another early-stage gold core cultivator. With the soft laughter, the blood whip was taken back by its owner. A blood-red man slowly came over, smiling,\u201d Nine against one. It\u2019s interesting.\u201dOther Duan Hun Sect cultivators shouted,\u201d Who are you. Don\u2019t interfere with the affairs of Duan Hun Sect.\u201dHearing these, Luo Jianqing narrowed his eyes and Yan Su even pulled a long face. Yan Su hurried to take back his big axe. And he flew to other Duan Hun Sect disciples and looked at the man in red who had arrived here suddenly.\u201cMy name? You don\u2019t deserve to know it.\u201d Mo Qiu smiled and covered his lips. He reached Luo Jianqing and said,\u201d I just can\u2019t bear to see you guys gang up and bully one. I am fed up with you.\u201dDuan Hun Sect disciple was dissatisfied and said: \u201cBrother Luo hurt our three disciples of Qi refining period.\u201dMo Qiu said with a strange tone, \u201cIt\u2019s said that death and life have determined appointments, riches and honors depend upon the heaven in Liu Yan Valley. You lost. Aren\u2019t you ashamed to live on?\u201cHow dare you.\u201dLuo Jianqing turned his head to Mo Qiu and showed a fist-and-palm salute, \u201cBrother Mo, thanks.\u201dMo Qiu waved, \u201cDon\u2019t mention it. I always hate the guys from Duan Hun Sect.\u201dLuo Jianqing was surprised,\u201d You have a connection with Duan Hun Sect? You have ever been to thirty-six states?Mo Qiu suddenly squinted, \u201cyou have done a survey of me?\u201dLuo Jianqing was silent.At this moment, the atmosphere between Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu suddenly went somber. Seeing that, Yan Su clenched his big axe in his hand and just wanted to attack secretly. As unexpected, suddenly the sky in the east burst into a blood red light. The great power fell and rolled up the dust. The wind howled.Luo Jianqing, Mo Qiu and Yan Su looked at each other.\u201cThere is a treasure to be born.\u201dThree people went straight to the center of the pressure like lights.Luo Jianqing was fastest when flying. To his surprise, it was Mo Qiu that followed him closely and Yan Su was left so far behind.Luo Jianqing hurried to speed up, but Mo Qiu still followed him closely. Soon, Yan Su was nowhere to see.In the face of such a treasure, each one carried on his own way, just as Yan Su also left his younger brothers and sisters.When Luo Jianqing arrived, he happened to see that Li Xiuchen was cut by a cultivator of foundation level. Luo Jianqing never glanced at Li Xiuchen, he directly looked at the blood red fruit in the middle of the sandpit.Luo Jianqing opened his eyes wide and even stopped breathing for a moment.Here came the voice of Mo Qiu by the side of Luo Jianqing,\u201d The man in front of you seems to be a disciple of your Tai Hua Mountain. He was cut and in danger. You can save him in time. Why don\u2019t you save him?\u201dLuo Jianqing said,\u201d Brother Mo, you see it wrong. I don\u2019t see our Tai Hua Mountain disciple.\u201dMo Qiu raised his eyebrow surprisingly and he didn\u2019t say anything more.Here was a sunken sand dune whose radius was about ten miles.Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes were fixed on the blood red fruit, but he did not move. Because he knew although Mo Qiu was talking to him nicely at this moment, as long as he took action, Mo Qiu would stop him with his whip. Likewise, when Mo Qiu moved, he would draw his sword.In order to return the kindness of the predecessor of the Mo family in his previous life, Luo Jianqing would never kill Mo Qiu, but this did not mean that Luo Jianqing would give up such a treasure.There was \u00a0a stalemate at this moment.The rouge cultivators of Foundation Level who were being onlookers saw two cultivators of gold core level suddenly and were totally shocked, not daring to make any movement. Before long, Yan Su flew here and saw the blood red fruit surprisingly. He said,\u201d Is it a spiritual herb above seventh grade?The spiritual herbs in the world were divided into nine grades. Most of the spiritual herbs above the seventh had their own consciousness. The eighth grade could have talented skills, and ninth grade could even turn into human forms. In the past thousand years, no one had ever seen it!It was strange that the blood red fruit seemed unconscious, though it exerted overwhelming power. But there was no doubt that it was a spiritual herb at least above the sixth grade. The ordinary flame fruit couldn\u2019t match it.The fruit created immense fluctuations with its born. Gradually, lots of cultivators were drawn over.Luo Jianqing finally understood why he had no idea of the fruit in his previous life. Such a horrible fruit was on the fourth layer of Liu Yan Valley, not the innermost! At this time in his another life, he went to the eighth layer of Liu Yan Valley with great difficulty. How could he know what happened on the fourth layer?This time, he finally saw it.Mo Qiu was right just now. Luo Jianqing indeed could have saved Li Xiuchen, but he didn\u2019t.Li Xiuchen was not useful for him anymore for this adventure. Since he had found the spiritual herb, for the sake of Heaven Dao, he wouldn\u2019t kill Li Xiuchen with his sword. But as for Li Xiuchen\u2019s next trial, it had nothing to do with Luo Jianqing.As the saying went, when shepherds quarreled, the wolf had a winning game. The book said that Li Xiuchen finally got this fruit. But this time, Luo Jianqing would not give him the chance.Around the sunken sand dune, hundreds of cultivators slowly gathered.The cultivators of gold core level all flew in the sky. The cultivators of foundation level and Qi refining period didn\u2019t give up and stayed around and waited for a chance. In the beginning, only Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu were in a stalemate, but later Yan Su joined them.After a half-day stalemate, three late-stage gold core successors from one mountain and late-stage gold core sister-Ming Hua Fairy from Fei Hua Sect also arrived here.There were a total of six late-stage gold core cultivators besides Luo Jianqing.Seven people looked at others carefully. No one would move first.In this way, seven forces and hundreds of cultivators had been a deadlock at the sand dune for three days.On the morning of the third day, it seemed that the blood red fruit moved slightly and flew to Mo Qiu and fell into his arms.Mo Qiu seemed to be prepared early. He turned around and ran with the fruit.Luo Jianqing was nearest to Mo Qiu. When he saw it, he immediately pulled up his sword and stopped Mo Qiu before he left the dune.Next, numerous spiritual attacks went straight to Mo Qiu who was in red.\u201cThe Heaven Separated Ghost Axe! \u201d\u201cFlower Sounds.\u201dWhite Snow Spear.\u201cThe Heaven Phoenix Jade Kill\u201d\u201cCloud and Sun broken Arrow\u201dSuddenly, noticing that so many attacks had come to Mo Qiu. Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes narrowed. It was only a second of hesitation. He actually turned to the five late-stage cultivators and pulled up his sword.\u201cSeizing seasons.\u201d\u201cSeizing lives.\u201d\u201cOne Sword turns nine-pedaled Lotus.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayRumble! Rumble! Rumble!Green Lotus Nine Swords Formation collided with innumerable spiritual power!All the attacks from the cultivator in the Qi Condensation level or Foundation Establishment level on the ground had just scratched the surface and didn\u2019t work a lot, even some gold core cultivators couldn\u2019t hurt him at all, except for the five cultivators who were in the late-stage Gold Core. Just like a mountain of a wave, their attacks rushed to him crazily with five people\u2019s cultivation gathered, breaking the Green Lotus Nine Swords Formation. Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help but grunt, and blood watered from the corner of his mouth.Standing in the lead of the five people was the first disciple of Duan Hun sect, Yan Su.Yan Su stepped forward and looked at Luo Jianqing coldly, asking in a chilling voice, \u201cFellow Cultivator Luo, what do you mean!\u201dLuo Jianqing kept Mo Qiu behind, and even with the blood on the corner of his mouth, he still stayed calm and never lost poise. He said calmly, \u201cFellow Cultivator Mo saved me before, and as the return, I\u2019ll never leave him in danger!\u201dThe seventh son of Bai Family laughed slightly, and he took back the fans, \u201cSo, Fellow Cultivator Luo\u2019s going to fight against all of us, alone?\u201dJust when he finished his words, Mo Qiu\u2019s gentle voice sounded, \u201cNot alone. He got me here!\u201dLuo Jianqing trembled slightly and felt a bit gratified from the bottom of his heart.At least Mo Qiu wasn\u2019t the guy who acted perfidiously and secretly ran away when he stopped them just now.With the white robe on him, Bai Qi was a handsome and impressive guy when they met on the entrance of the Liu Yan Vally, but now, his white clothes were stained by the sands and his face wasn\u2019t clean anymore. Hearing what Mo Qiu said, a light flashed in his eyes and he asked, \u201cSo you are Mo Qiu from the Mo Family. I\u2019ve heard about you a lot like you\u2019re the talent disciple of the sinners. You know what, Bai family had a good relationship from generation to generation with Mo Family and My auntie was the daughter of Mo Family. I know that it must cost you a lot to cultivate such a level for you in the Cold Desert. If you can give the Yan Fruit to us, I\u2019ll promise to help you to get in the Mo Family!\u201dBai Qi\u2019s words finished, and he got no response, except for the sound of the wind blowing through the dune.His face changed, and asked sputteringly, \u201cHave you heard what I said? What does your expression mean!\u201dLuo Jianqing looked back curiously and saw that Mo Qiu rolled his eyes and sneered, \u201cIt means that I heard someone was farting.\u201dBai Qi was irritated, \u201cYou son of\u2026!\u201dThe war might break out at any moment!Bai Qi raised the white spear on his hand and pointed at Mo Qiu directly. The head of the spear was made by some kind of material like jade so that it reflected bright color under the sunshine. His spiritual power gathered on the head of the long spear constantly, and suddenly Bai Qi flew up, with his sharp spear stabbed toward Mo Qiu!Meanwhile, a horrible storm formed behind Bai Qi. As soon as it showed up, the whole dune was forced to lower considerably immediately by its terrible power, let alone all the trembling cultivators under the level of the Foundation Establishment.This was the second shoot of Snow white seven shoots, Snow-white spear!At this time, Bright Flower Faerie who stood bear Bai Qi played the unknown Chinese zither which looked nothing special. With her soft hands played on the strings, the Chinese zither began to tremble slightly and its power became stronger and stronger. The moment she played the ninth note, she opened her eyes widely and waved her hand.\u201cFlowers bloom and I don\u2019t, when I bloom, they all fall!\u201d\u201cSound of the flowers!\u201dJust now, they used their unique skills when they met Mo Qiu\u2019s attack, but it happened so quickly that they weren\u2019t 100% prepared and didn\u2019t use all the power. That was also why Luo Jianqing could stop them for a while temporarily. But now, both of them attacked with all their power. Around them, the rolling spiritual power told everybody silently how scary their unique skills were actually!Seeing that, Yan Su and the other two people prepared to fight back, but suddenly, a figure wearing blue clothes showed up in front of them.An excited clang sounded from the Floating Frost Sword in his hand, the handsome cultivator, Luo Jianqing smiled faintly and said, \u201cHey, you! Your opponent is me!\u201dYan Su squinted and rushed toward with his Ghost Axe without any mercy.Meanwhile, the other two disciples also jumped and flew to Luo Jianqing with their bow and sword.The war started!It was no surprise when they saw Luo Jianqing could stop the unique skills of Yan su and the others, after all, he was Tai Hua\u2019s first disciple. However, when Mo Qiu waved his blood long whip and stopped Bai Qi and Bright Flower Faerie\u2019s shoots, all of them opened their eyes widely with disbelief.\u201cI never know that there was an extra dark horse in the 36 states!\u201dLuo Jianqing played his long sharp sword and used the second seize of\u00a0Nine Heavenly Seizure Record\u00a0at the beginning with no reserve.All the spiritual energy ran together to him. Seizing lives, balanced all the creature!His Green Lotus Nine Swords Formation crashed into every raider and Mo Qiu still didn\u2019t take the blood fruit back to the Interspatial Ring. He held it with one hand and waved his long whip to fight Bai Qi and Bright Flower Faerie.Countless spiritual power crashed on the ground constantly and made one after one hole. Many cultivators hid near trying to seize a chance and grab the blood fruit. But after some unlucky cultivators were killed by Yan Su\u2019s undifferentiated attack, the others hid far away immediately.The Snow-white spear, soft but dangerous flowers\u2019 sound, horrible Ghost Axe, the shining sharp arrow\u2026And the long blooded wipe and the Green Lotus Nine Swords Formation could break the sky!The most excellent generation were fighting here across the whole Xuan Tian mainland!The war lasted for one day and one night. All their Interspatial Ring had enough medicine to recover their spiritual power, so the war never stopped! Even the onlookers dared not to let down the guard and kept their attention to the war carefully so that they could find a chance in the first time. After all, a quarrel which benefited only a third party.But what surprised them it was Luo Jianqing that \u00a0fell into the dangerous situation slowly and passively hit back while the unknown Mo Qiu gained the upper hand in his fight. Bai Qi seemed like that he had no extra power to fight back but hardly accepted every single move from Mo Qiu, Bright Flower Faerie was having a hard time too.Soon, Bai Qi spit blood and flew back quickly. Bright Flower Faerie followed suit and her Chinese zither broke at the same time.Then Mo Qiu waved his long whip to Luo Jianqing, breaking one of the ghost shadows cast by Yan Su\u2019s ghost axe.Mo Qiu said seriously,\u201d Sorry, I\u2019m late. Luo Jianqing.\u201dWith a pale face, Luo Jianqing smiled faintly, \u201cnot quite so.\u201dAfter this, both of them combined against the common enemies!One was the first disciple of Tai Hua in the middle-stage gold core level and the other was just a Mo Family\u2019s sinner that nobody knew before in Liu Yan Vally.But when they fought together, not only Yan Su but also the others got into trouble immediately. They fought for several rounds, but in the end, the bowstring of one competitor from Geng Family got broken and the girl from Yun family was badly injured. Although Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu also got heavily injured and attacking in the air weakly, they looked at Yan Su who was at the same situation fiercely.Seeing this, Yan Su curled his lips. He thought for a while with his eyebrows drawn together, and then he said unwillingly, \u201clet\u2019s go!\u201dHe ran away!All the people around burst out exclamation.This war would be well-known in the whole Liu Yan Valley and Chang State and, all the 36 states in the Xuan Tian mainland alike!Hearing Yan Su\u2019s words, Bai Qi and Bright Flower Faerie decided to follow suit. As for the girl of Yun Family and the guy from Geng Family, they also slunk away after hesitating for a second.Luo Jianqing heaved a sigh secretly and was about to look at Mo Qiu near him. But unexpectedly, as soon as he just turned his sight, all the hair on his body suddenly stood up when he met Mo Qiu\u2019s pretty eyes where he saw that countless spiritual power attacked toward them.Obviously, those scoundrels feigned defeat, and a sneak attack was what they were really up to!\u201cOne Sword Turns Nine-pedaled Lotus!\u201d\u201cBlood Shadow Wipe!\u201dAt the same time, they attacked back but it was too late so that they couldn\u2019t get enough time to hide but were forced to fly out. Luo Jianqing was hit to fall on the warm sands. He raised his Floating Frost Sword calling the lighting and was going to fight back. However, suddenly, he felt that he was felling down in the sands.\u201cLuo Jianiqing! Get out of there!\u201dIt was Mo Qiu\u2019s voice came from far away anxiously.Luo Jianqing opened his eyes widely. He now finally realized what happened to him now.\u201cOMG! It was the ghost drift sands!\u201d\u201cHoly crap! The ghost drift sands is hidden near the dune!\u201dGhost drift sands, one kind of special dangerous situation in Liu Yan Valley, which had nothing different from the normal sands if you saw it from the surface. But once somebody stepped on it, it would run as the water until he was swallowed up. It wouldn\u2019t kill you by absorbing your spiritual power but the one would never get rid of it, even the cultivator who was in the late-stage gold core level was doomed not to get out.Yan Su and the others stood in the air and looked at Luo Jianqing carefully who was now in the center of the ghost drift sands. They knew clearly that they would definitely die if they fell in the ghost drift sands. So they just watched aside waiting for that Luo Jianqing disappeared in the ghost drift sands and then they could kill Mo Qiu and grabbed the blood fruit.Seeing that half of his body was swallowed by the ghost drift sands, Bright Flower Faerie frowned and sighed, \u201cHe is the first disciple of Tai Hua. Is it all right if we didn\u2019t help and watch him die? How are we going to justify ourselves to Tai Hua if they ask?\u201dBai Qi responded, \u201cBright Flower Faerie, maybe you forgot that life and death are decreed by fate in the Liu Yan Valley. It\u2019s not us who killed him but the ghost drift sands.\u201dBright Flower Faerie averted her eyes and said worriedly in a low voice, \u201cBut his master was the legendary Sir, Xuan Lingzi.\u201dAll the people who heard that were shocked. Later, Yan Su said, \u201cBut the rules were made by all the sects, even the Xuan Lingzi cannot break it.\u201dOf course, Luo Jianqing now couldn\u2019t hear the words that they were talking about at all. He kept trying to use different magic tools and moves to get out, but he failed. It was known by everyone that no matter who touched the ghost drift sands, he would be swallowed up!An alarm bell rang in his heart, but there was nothing difference showed on his face. Meanwhile, all the people on the site couldn\u2019t help but sigh in their heart when they saw Luo Jianqing\u2019s calm and handsome face. Such a talent young cultivator, now he would die here.Yeah, he had Super roots!He got nobody as his opponent under the level of the Nascent Soul!He was the first disciple of Tai Hua and the son of Yu Xiao peak!But so what?On the road of every genius grew, it was always filled with danger. Everyone would probably die at any time.Power meant anything in the cultivated world even for the one who was called genius, he would lose his life without enough power.Sweats broke out on his pale forehead. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t notice that the red nevus on his forehead became more and more bright as if it would burn in the next second. The moment when the ghost drift sands swallowed his shoulder and his red nevus burned, suddenly\u2026\u201cLuo Jianqing!\u201dOne hand grabbed Luo Jianqing\u2019s arms out of the ghost drift sands.Luo Jianqing looked at them directly surprisingly and saw a charming cultivator who wore a red robe flying in the air and holding his hand, saying, \u201cDon\u2019t tell me that you will die of the ghost drift sands? I don\u2019t think that you are so weak as the disciple of Xuan Lingzi. Luo Jianqing, come on!\u201dThe last thing all the cultivator on the site saw was Mo Qiu\u2019s smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayJust within a breath, two mega talented cultivators disappeared in the ghost drift sands. Then it resumed peace like the ordinary sands as nothing happened before. But they all knew huge danger washiding under its surface.Bright Flower Faerie sighed, \u201cThey took the blood fruit. Well, it\u2019s a good funeral object for them.\u201dAfter saying that, she left.The girl of Yun Family hesitated for a while but then she also left directly.Bai Qi searched around for a long time but found nothing. Finally, he could just fly away unwillingly.Besides, the guy from Geng Family turned away as well.Yan Su was the last one who left there. Being armored by the Ghosts Shadows, he ran his spiritual sense searching the ghost drift sands. But unfortunately, the ghost drift sands blocked his spiritual mind outside as if it locked the door, leaving a secret space inside.Yan Su sliced through the ghost drift sands and then left angrily.The whole dune became peace again, and hundreds of cultivators stayed there for three days. After confirming that indeed nothing happen again, they all left with pity. But no one knew that after Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu were swallowed up by the ghost drift sands, they quickly lost their spiritual power!On the road opened by their spiritual power, they kept falling!It was a dark deep road and nobody knew where the end was so that they couldn\u2019t do anything but running their spiritual power and going ahead.However, as a cultivator who just had a cultivation of the mid-stage gold core, Luo Jianqing soon ran out of his power and passed out. Immediately, Mo Qiu pulled his hand. His blood power kept burning until it was used up. Mo Qiu sneered, \u201cOnly you, it was not enough to kill me.\u201dNext second, powerful evil power exploded!They fell faster, and before the red nevus on Luo Jianqing\u2019s forehead was about to wake up but now its light became dark slowly.The black evil power burning crazily and brought them fall deeper and deeper.It was like after one day or one month\u2026They finally got out of the dark road and stranded near a burning river. Mo Qiu\u2019s power was exhausted. His face turned pale and after he spat mouthful blood with black spiritual light, he lost his minds. The blood fruit rolled to Luo Jianqing and stopped next to his left hand.Three days passed by\u2026And seven days, ten days, one hundred days\u2026They all fell into coma deeply. The black evil power on Mo Qiu kept springing up, fixing his broken meridians. But Luo Jianqing was at death\u2019s door now. He was badly injured during the fighting before and then he stayed in the ghost drift sands for a long time which ran out his power. Now, his Elixir Field was withering slowly.In the Ling Yun Hall on the Tai Hua mountain, the light of his Destiny lamp on the second floor dimmed down slowly.At the moment the lamp was about to extinct, Luo Jianqing\u2019s red nevus suddenly burned near the burning river. Meanwhile, a figure in a white gown showed up.Noticing Luo Jianqing\u2019s situation now, the mysterious Sir\u2019s face changed a lot. As soon as he was going to use his power to fix Luo Jianqing\u2019s broken meridians and Elixir Field, he saw the blood fruit.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s pupils shrunk, \u201cHow strong this power is!\u201dHe reached out and drove the blood fruit to his hand, then he made a Hand-seals without any hesitate, turning the blood fruit around in the air. Soon later, much bloody power flew out and immerged into Luo Jianqing\u2019s body.After spinning for twenty-four hours, the volume of blood fruit reduced to fist-size. At present, the natural color had revived on Luo Jianqing\u2019s face, and his breath had been smooth. His Elixir field that withered before became animate again, meanwhile, his meridians from heads to foot was connected.Xuan Lingzi looked down, stared at the Blood Fruit, and knitted his brows. After confirming that the blood fruit owned pure spirit power, he poured it into the elixir filed of Luo Jianqing with relieve. He used the prestige of a cultivator in deity transformation period to force blood fruit to sign an agreement with Luo Jianqing, which made blood fruit rotating gently in Luo Jianqing\u2019s body and spilling over spirit power constantly.At this time, Xuan Lingzi had time to turn around and looked at the strange male cultivator in red not far from here.Out-of-body of Primordial life, even though it was merely half of the primordial life, would extremely consume energy. And even Xuan Lingzi would felt extremely exhausted to handle with. Thus when he sealed half of his primordial life in the cinnabar mole by Tu Na breathing, he would never appear unless Luo Jianqing\u2019s life was at risk or Luo Jianqing was in a great emotional fluctuation.Because every time he appeared, his noumenon would suffer great damage.Xuan Lingzi also did not know how many times could his primordial life save Luo Jianqing for Liu Yan valley was a million miles away from Taihua mountainWhile in deep sleep, Xuan Lingzi could only roughly perceive what happened to Luo Jianqing, such as this strange male cultivator, which he did not have too many memories but he knew that this strange cultivator had saved his apprentice several times.Staring at the black devil qi around his body, Xuan Lingzi sighed,\u201cWhat a pity that he had congealed devil Qi during Nascent Soul. This extraordinary cultivation talent was unexpectedly from a low level of the first level spiritual bone of, what\u2019s more, it was devil cultivation. His future would be promising if he had a better spiritual bone.After making sure this strange cultivator was repairing the body by his devil qi, Xuan Lingzi turned and walked away without looking at him again.He was sitting beside Luo Jianqing and gently staring at this apprentice of his own sect.After three days and three nights, Luo Jianqing gave a slight snort and gradually woke up. Simultaneously, Xuan Lingzi changed into a flowing light, flew into the glabella of Luo Jianqing, and became a deep red cinnabar mole again.When Luo Jianqing woke up, he only felt that he had experienced death and all his bones were crushed. As he raised his arm, all his meridians twitched with pain. After a full hour\u2019s rest, he felt much better. Then, to his surprise, he found all his injuries had been cured!\u201cWhat happened? Hadn\u2019t I been badly injured and drained all my spirit power?\u201dLuo Jianqing began to check his body immediately. Following his meridians, his spiritual consciousness finally found the blood fruit spinning in his elixir field\uff01His eyes widened in shock.Somehow this fruit had unexpectedly connected with him in spirit, just like a spirit beast that had taken him as the master.No matter how Luo Jianqing thought about it, he could not figure out what had happened. But he could not think more because he had found Mo Qiu not far from here soon.\u201cMo Qiu!\u201dAt present, closing his eyes tightly, Mo Qiu was still in a coma. Looking at the devil qi restoring Mo Qiu\u2019s body, which looked like a semitransparent black cocoon wrapping around him, Luo Jianqing was in a great shock.\u201c\u2026 I can\u2019t believe it. You are a fiend cultivator!\u201dIt all made sense now.Why Mo Qiu could be in late-sage-gold-core before the age of fifty, why he could grow up in the barren Cold Desert, why he could have such a scary cultivation base, all of these were because he was in fiend cultivation!Luo Jianqing was seized with mixed feelings, he did not know how to face him.In history, unless there was a war between Human Race and Devil, fiend cultivators were irreconcilably hostile to other cultivators.Fiend cultivation featured a more powerful cultivation method which could snatch the spirit power of any living creature. They cultivated the fiend method just like Luo Jianqing took away the spiritual power contained in the body of a predecessor of Mo Clan. As long as your strength was brutal enough, fiend cultivator even could snatch the spirit power of a living person.Fiend cultivation was usually unruly as well as arbitrary.Luo Jianqing did not know how much blood had he tainted with, but he did know it was Mo Qiu who held his hand without hesitation when he was caught in ghost drift sands. Mo Qiu was his friend, not enemy! Even though Mo Qiu was a fiend cultivator, he would kill Mo Qiu on the battlefield, not here.Thinking of this, Luo Jianqing began to sit in meditation to recover his spirit energy.After ten days, the devil qi around Mo Qiu gradually disappeared, but he still did not wake up. Therefore Luo Jianqing held him to a prepared cave, took out all the spiritual herbs and pills left during his interspatial ring, and helped him to cure his wound.During this time, Luo Jianqing was always cultivating most of the time and wanted to reach the late-stage gold core. Meanwhile, he also observed the terrain around here.This was a very strange valley. Not large, but looked like a two or three square miles place. Surrounded by high cliffs, the walls were smooth, and the cliff on the top formed a huge dome, which made this valley become a big room made of stone cliffs.And in the center of the valley, the burning river was flowing slowly.Having no idea what kind of flame formed the burning river, even Luo Jianqing could\u00a0 not approach it. Because as soon as he was close to it in ten zhang, he would be pushed back by the fierce gold flare.Obviously, only by the effort of Luo Jianqing in the middle-stage gold core, he definitely could not escape.After another month, when Luo Jianqing picked up his last third level of earth level Tongtian Pill and poured half of the strength of the pill into Mo Qiu\u2019s body, Mo Qiu let out a stuffy cry, and suddenly black blood was spat out from his month.Luo Jianqing said, \u201cMo Qiu? Mo Qiu?\u201dMo Qiu in red opened his eyes slowly and stared at Luo Jianqing in a daze.Having lived in this strange valley for several months, Luo Jianqing could not help to get thrilled when he saw Mo Qiu finally woke up. He said, \u201cMo Qiu, don\u2019t move. We have been swallowed by ghost drift sands and came here unintelligibly. I have not found out the exit though I have tried several months. We could take actions together when you wake up, maybe we could have a chance to escape.Seeming to operate the spiritual power in his body, Mo Qiu breathed slightly.After a short while, he looked up and stared at Luo Jianqing, said,\u201call right. I may need a hundred days to recover to my peak period. At the time, I could take actions with you to\u2026\u201dHe stopped suddenly, and his charming eyes were widely open. He looked at Luo Jianqing in a shock and shut to Luo Jianqing in a raising voice, full of disbelief,\u201cYou have robbed my blood spirit fruit!\u201dLuo jianqing was in a surprise, \u201cwhat?\u201d\u201cLuo Jianqing! You have robbed my blood spirit fruit! I can\u2019t believe you have robbed my blood spirit fruit!\u201dAs Mo Qiu saying, he grabbed Luo Jianqing\u2019s arm with one hand tightly.Knitting his brows, Luo Jianqing understood instantly,\u201cMo Qiu, actually I did not understand what had happened. When I woke up, the blood fruit has\u2026\u201d\u201cLuo Jianqing! You robbed my blood spirit fruit and signed an agreement with it. I certainly will take my blood spirit fruit back!\u201dAs soon as he finishing his words, a long blood whip suddenly appeared in his hand and went straight to Luo Jianqing \u2014 Mo Qiu was so angry that he did not give any thought to his injured body. So straightforward and decisive of his long whip that it was waved without any hesitation. Mixed with heinous devil qi and Mo Qiu\u2019s residual spiritual power, the long whip was in a life and death struggle. It seems that it was desperate to kill Luo Jianqing!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Jianqing gathered his fingers to accumulate the blue sword-light (as same as sword energy) to entangle the blood-colored long whip directly.\u201cFellow Cultivator Mo! You\u2019ve bad injured and hadn\u2019t recovered yet. Just take it easy, and we will figure out what\u2019s going on about the Blood fruit. Okay?\u201dHowever, Mo Qiu didn\u2019t buy his words at all. He shook his wrist lightly and took his long whip back. Sitting on the stone bed with the support of his hand, he smiled coldly while the blood watering from the corner of his mouth slowly, \u201cStop talking \u00a0nonsense! Since you have built bond with Blood fruit, I would never get it back unless I kill you!\u201dAs soon as his words finished, the blood whip moved quickly and slapped it to Luo Jianqing again.It was the first time for Luo Jianqing to face Mo Qiu\u2019s blood-colored whip directly as his opponent. Especially, this time, Mo Qiu used all his power with the addition of black evil power! Flying in the air, his long whip kept winding rapidly as the countless snakes with blood color, which formed a huge scary bloody shadow.Luo Jianqing dared not to let down his guard and drew his Floating Frost Sword immediately.Almost at the same time, his Floating Frost Sword crashed with the long blood-colored whip. With a shining sword light flashed, the stone in the cave was broken into pieces. With the shadow of the long whip cast, all the broken stones flew into all directions! After several rounds, Mo Qiu gradually fell into an inferior position, and soon Luo Jianqing attacked with his sword surrounded by the thunder, ending the fight with his sharp cold sword pointed Mo Qiu\u2019s throat in a very close distance.Mo Qiu wiped the blood on his face silently and then sneered, \u201cDo you believe that I can kill you right now by thousand ways and black will be your fall.\u201dHis tone was so cold and freezing, with the deep scary killing intent.Staying still, Luo Jianqing looked at him with his sword and said after a while, \u201cMo Qiu, the blood fruit was in my body when I woke up and I didn\u2019t know why it happened. Maybe it approached me on its own initiative and then\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat the hell are you talking about? I\u2019m the only person it would choose between you and me! It is the blood spirit fruit!\u201dLuo Jianqing asked, \u201cWhat\u2019s the blood spirit fruit?\u201dBefore when they were in the dune, be it Yan Su of the Duan Hun sect or the Bright Flower Faerie of the Fei Hua Sect or the others from Eight Clans, none of them could recognize the Blood fruit. Even Luo Jianqing, he always thought that the blood fruit was just one kind of Yan Fruit\u2019s variant. Of course, there was nothing recorded in the book,\u00a0Seeking Immortality\u00a0about the blood fruit as well. Therefore, the only thing he heard about was the name \u201cBlood fruit\u201d, which was called by Li Xiuchen.Mo Qiu\u2019s face turned pale quickly. His spiritual energy which just recovered a little was exhausted now after the fighting just now.Mo Qiu said in a cold tone, \u201cYou know that I\u2019m not Dao cultivator\u201dKeeping silence for a moment, Luo Jianqing said, \u201cYeah, you\u2019re fiend cultivator.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201d Mo Qiu admitted it without any hesitation, \u201cThe blood fruit was the unique product as the result of the fiend cultivating. The way of fiend cultivating was the way of killing. In my whole life, there were only less than 10 fiend cultivators I ever met have no blood on their hands. Even in the whole world, 99 percent of the fiend cultivators made themselves by killing innocent creatures. And the fiend cultivators who only killed their opponent and the guilty person were less than 100 persons.\u201dHearing this, Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help asking, \u201cWhat about you, Mo Qiu? Have you ever killed human cultivator? And how many years you\u2019ve been cultivating for since you said you\u2019ve met a lot of devil cultivators.\u201dMo Qiu looked up staring at Luo Jianqing coldly. Looking at each other like this for a long while with a Floating Frost Sword between them, then Mo Qiu opened his mouth and said slightly, \u201cNo, I haven\u2019t.\u201dWith no known reason, Luo Jianqing heaved a sigh after hearing Mo Qiu\u2019s answer.And Mo Qiu continued, \u201cIt was filled with the blood on the way of being a fiend cultivator, so all the fiend cultivators will get a bottle-neck when they reach the Body Fusion Period and hardly get promoted. In this case, there is a unique method of cultivation for fiend cultivator called Blood Spirit Skill. In the process of the cultivation, fiend cultivator will turn all his spiritual power into the blood and then water one blood spirit tree with it. And the time of growing the tree depends on the cultivation of the owner. The more powerful the cultivator is, the more time and more suffering required accordingly. After the blood spirit fruit is borne, fiend cultivator will eat it and then he can begin to cultivate the Blood Spirit Skill.\u201dLuo Jianqing asked surprisingly, \u201cSo just eat it?\u201d The hidden meaning in his words was that it would be so easy if all he needed to do was only to eat one fruit.Mo Qiu gave him a mock smile, \u201cYou know nothing! When the blood spirit fruit is ripe, it is also the time that the fiend cultivator lost all his spiritual power and blood. And the fiend cultivator must eat the fruit immediately when he still can feel to the spiritual power within the blood spirit fruit. Do you know what result he will get if the fiend cultivator eats the fruit after he lost all his power and blood?\u201dLuo Jianqing said without thinking, \u201cHe will die in a violent manner.\u201dWithout any spiritual power and blood in his body, the fiend cultivator would be reduced to a living death which was just stronger than the ordinary people a bit. Even he survived, he was still in a terribly dangerous situation.Mo Qiu nodded, \u201cYes. Of course, the one who ate the blood fruit will meet his new life which hardly happened in 100 persons. There were so many blood spiritual fruit in the world, what we need to do is to find it.\u201d After a pause, a hopeless sad emotion flashed in Mo Qiu\u2019s eyes. He sighed, \u201cIt seemed that the fiend cultivator is powerful and no one is his opponent in the earlier stage on the way of the fiend cultivating, but in the late stage, he will suffer endless vicissitudes. You may feel that it\u2019s not so difficult to cultivate the blood spirit skill. But do you know that the Body Fusion Period is the ceiling that \u00a0the fiend cultivator who cultivates the blood spirit skill could reach.\u201dHearing this, Luo Jianqing fell into the silence.He still held his sword while Mo Qiu lowered his head. It was so quiet at this time. In the end, Mo Qiu couldn\u2019t insist any more and fell. Until now Luo Jianqing finally found that like a spent arrow, Mo Qiu was actually struggling not \u00a0collapse in front of him.Entirely debilitated, Mo Qiu lied on the stone bed. A mixture of emotions spreading over his face, he stared at Luo Jianqing, saying, \u201cLuo Jianqing, give my blood spirit fruit \u2026back!\u201dLuo Jianqing replied after a long silence, \u201cYou also told me that you can\u2019t take it back as long as I am still alive. Besides, Fellow Cultivator Mo, the treasure doesn\u2019t belong to any specific one in the world. He who is capable gets it. Although I have no interest in the blood spirit fruit, now\u2026 please forgive me that I can\u2019t give it back.\u201dClosing his eyes slowly, Mo Qiu smiled in sarcasm.Luo Jianqing still stood in front of the stone bed quietly.After a while, he heard that Mo Qiu said hoarsely, \u201cFuck off!\u201dHesitating for a moment, Luo Jianqing put three little jade bottles near Mo Qiu and then away he left.On the stone bed, the corners of his eyes began to wet but the tears in his eyes didn\u2019t fall. When Luo Jianqing arrived at the gate of the cave, Mo Qiu suddenly shouted angrily, \u201cLuo Jianqing! Don\u2019t let me see your face again or I will kill you directly! I will tear you apart and destroy your bones!\u201dLuo Jianqing halted his steps and then he still walked out.In the next days, Luo Jianqing found another cave in the valley and continued to cultivate.In fact, the blood fruit didn\u2019t belong to Mo Qiu as well but he grabbed it from others. There was nothing wrong in what Luo Jianqing said before, the treasure doesn\u2019t belong to any specific one in the world. He who is capable gets it. No matter what, the power decided the states in the cultivating world. Mo Qiu couldn\u2019t judge him even one word even Luo Jianqing grabbed the blood spirit fruit by tricks.\u201cDid he say that\u2026 he could kill me in thousands of ways?\u201d Thinking the way he lied \u00a0on the stone bed, Luo Jianqing shook his head slowly and sighed, \u201cIt seemed that the anger made him lose his mind. Such an idiot.\u201dTime passed by uneventfully, Luo Jianqing knew nothing about Mo Qiu\u2019s situation now and also didn\u2019t hear any sound from the cave. On this morning, Luo Jianqing walked to the golden burning river for ways to get out and strengthening his power.When Luo Jianqing drew near to the golden Burning at a distance of 10 zhang, the Burning suddenly became fierce.The Burning became a giant golden eagle which swooped from the sky and pecked at Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes straightly. Luo Jianqing raised the Floating Frost Sword and cut it off at one strike! At a distance of 9 zhang, the Burning became a fierce golden tiger that came straight toward Luo Jianqing. Luo Jianqing drew down the thunderclap with his sword and smashed the tiger!Then he clenched his teeth and came closer to a distance of 3 zhang!It was then that the Burning turned into a long golden dragon!The dragon had five claws, its vivid scales sending an archaic and vigorous breath. It rushed out from the Burning River spirally. With head lowering and eyes looking at Luo Jianqing, the dragon suddenly spoke with human language: \u201cDao Cultivator! You are one of Dao Cultivators!\u201dWith eyes shrinking suddenly, Luo Jianqing raised his sword immediately and drew down the thunderclap!\u201cWho are you!\u201dThe golden dragon spewed a hot dragon breath which melted the thunderclap.\u201cA Sword Cultivator, I hate Sword Cultivators among the Dao Cultivators most. Especially the Sword Cultivators of that\u2026that mountain. I forgot the name. They are the most annoying bunch. Since you\u2019ve got here, I\u2019d better kill you lest that I may become annoyed watching you.\u201dAs soon as then, a hot dragon breath rushed to his face directly! It was so hot that the cliffs around the valley tended to melt. The air became so hot that it rolled gradually, with heat waves splashing fitfully and burning numerous common plants quickly.Without hesitation, Luo Jianqing spoke formulas and his Floating Frost Sword flew in the air.\u201cOne Sword Turns Nine-pedaled Lotus!\u201dOne Nine-pedaled Lotus rushed to the dragon breath straightly. The two collided with a shocking light!\u201cThis flower! This damn flower! You are the disciple of that man! Ah!!!!! I\u2019m gonna kill you!\u201dMore fervent dragon Burning rushed to Luo Jianqing squarely. It has already become golden and its temperature was so hot that it became visible to the naked eye. Without hesitation, Luo Jianqing withdrew 3 zhangs. Suddenly, the golden Burning died out, the temperature dropped gradually and the dragon also disappeared.Before fading away, the golden Burning roared fierily: \u201cThe day is coming soon! You will die soon! You will die soon! I\u2019ll never admit my defeat. I\u2019m gonna kill the disciple of that man. I\u2019m gonna kill the disciple of that man\u2026\u201dThe Burning faded away into the golden Burning River. Luo Jianqing leaned against the Floating Frost Sword, panting heavily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Beyond all question, he would be killed by the dragon had he not withdrawn a certain distance to evade the attack!\u201cDragons were born in the seventh level. This dragon was in the level of Out-of-Body at least.\u201d\u201cThat man? Is he one of the senior cultivators of Yu Xiao Peak if he also uses martial arts in Nine Heavenly Seizure Record?\u201d\u201cAnd\u2026When was that day?\u201dAll questions remained unsolvable.Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t figure out the first two questions by his present cultivation base, but he felt an alarm going off in his mind with all his hair bristling when he confronted the last question. Especially the day when he looked at Huoyan River flowing into or out of the opening of the valley, he was seized with panic.The next moment, endless astral wind blew from that small opening!The wind blotted out the earth, and darkness enveloped the sky!For fear that Huoyan River would incur an inundation, Luo Jianqing had already drilled a hole in the ground beside the cliff and made a huge formation by countless Xuan Level magic treasures and Earth Level treasures. At present, he was planning to hasten to get into the hole to hide, but he suddenly looked up at the cave on the other side at the moment he was about to enter the hole. Holding his Floating Frost Sword in hesitation, Luo Jianqing unexpectedly touched the ground with his tiptoes and entered that cave rapidly.\u201cLuo Jianqing!\u201dThere came Mo Qiu\u2019s voice, in anger.Not allowing him to speak, Luo Jianqing directly picked up Mo Qiu and carried him on the shoulder, then they fled out of the cave quickly.At this very moment, the astral wind had already blown into the cave!The moment they made it to the cave entrance, a gust of astral wind blew on their face, which made Luo Jianqing\u2019s pupils contracted because of nervous tension. But he sidestepped to avoid it immediately.Bang!The cave behind them crumbled to dust.Mo Qiu widened his eyes and said in surprise,\u201cThe astral wind endowed by Demon Exalt Eagle, the Wind-broken Monster \u00a0of Heaven Level !\u201dLuo Jianqing could not hear Mo Qiu\u2019s words clearly, he just carried Mo Qiu\u2019s weak body with Mo Qiu\u2019s head dangling on his back. He took out Floating Frost Sword, cleaved all kinds of stone along the way, and carved out a new way to the tunnel.Bang!Everything in the valley was blown into dust by this horrific astral wind!Ten zhangs!Five zhangs!One zhang!One chi\u2026Rumbling!!!Suddenly, a gust of astral wind blew from Luo Jianqing\u2019s side and was ready to hack Mo Qiu. Clenching his teeth, Luo Jianqing turned around to protect Mo Qiu without hesitation. Floating Frost Sword uttered a cry of terror while innumerable forces had already approached and torn Luo Jianqing\u2019s cuff to tatters before astral wind closed in on.Tiny blazes of wind scratched Luo Jianqing\u2019s fingers and cheeks, left strips of scarlet wounds.At the last moment, Luo Jianqing heaved a deep sigh, then suddenly took out a cyan bamboo umbrella.When the cyan bamboo umbrella hit the fierce astral wind, its cyan ribs went up in smoke instantly and its fabric also crumbled into dust. However, during this brief period, Luo Jianqing did not give it a second look but hid into the channel with Mo Qiu and immediately performed incantation gestures to open the huge formation in the channel.Immediately, pieces of gold magic seals sparked in the dark channel.Mo Qiu who had already been thrown to the ground when they entered the channel opened his mouth wide and did not know what to say when he saw this. After quite a long time, he chuckled and said,\u201cLuo Jianqing of Taihua Mountain, you used the method of adopted by fiend cultivator to make this Earth Level Heaven-demon huge formation. Funny, so funny. What if Xuan Lingzi knows that his only disciple has become a fiend cultivator, I don\u2019t know what his reaction would he\u2026\u201dBefore he could finish his words, Luo Jianqing struck his cold Floating Frost Sword on his neck.The smile on Mo Qiu\u2019s face gradually disappeared.Luo Jianqing said with a poker face,\u201cMake an internal demon oath that you will never tell anybody what happened today.\u201dMo Qiu satirized, \u201cFor what?\u201dLuo Jianqing moved Floating Frost Sword and scratched a bloodstain on Mo Qiu\u2019s neck, and said,\u201cFor I can kill you now.\u201dMo Qiu kept silent.After a time of a cup of tea, he said in a low voice,\u201d I swear that I won\u2019t tell anybody what I have seen today for my whole life. If I break the oath, I will be swallowed up by an internal demon, and I will never be spared even after death.Luo Jianqing put down Floating Frost Sword with satisfaction, but Mo Qiu chuckled,\u201cWhy did you save me, Luo Jianqing? I have said I would kill you if I see you again. I can still tear you to shreds in the time of breath even if I have not recovered all my strength.Hearing Mo Qiu\u2019s soft laughter, Luo Jianqing squinted at him and said,\u201cSo are you going to kill me now?\u201dMo Qiu was speechless.In the narrow dark channel, their bodies slightly leaned against each other. Because all cultivators were blessed with a brilliant vision, Luo Jianqing could see all Mo Qiu\u2019s actions clearly, he also could launch an attack before Mo Qiu could play tricks. At the same time, the astral wind was still blowing outside the channel. It impacted on this Earth Level Heaven-demon huge formation and made the formation quake slightly.Closing his eyes slowly, Luo Jianqing was recovering his spiritual power consumed just now. At this time, he heard a husky voice, \u201cThank you\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing was still closing his eyes as if he had heard nothing.But Mo Qiu did not say any words.The astral wind blew for three days and three nights. After making sure that there was no menace outside, Luo Jianqing leaned out and observed the outside world for a while.The valley was worn out with all plants and flowers wiped out by astral wind, and even stones were ground into dust. Only smooth cliffs around the valley and the flowing Huoyan River were still tranquil as if nothing had happened.Lifting Mo Qiu\u2019s collar, Luo Jianqing carried him out of the channel.After putting him on the ground, Luo Jianqing turned around and walked away without looking at him. But nobody had expected that Mo Qiu would say aloud, \u201cLuo Jianqing, are you leaving now?\u201dLuo Jianqing ignored him and continued walking forward.Mo Qiu smiled gently, \u201cIf I say I have roughly know where this place is, do you still want to go away?\u201dLuo Jianqing suddenly stopped and turned around.With his smile gradually disappeared, Mo Qiu said seriously,\u201cI guess, it should be the ninth layer of Liuyanvalley.\u201dLiuyan valley had a total of nine layers, and Luo Jianqing only went into the other eight layers in his previous life, because he was kept out by an invisible fireward when he was going into the ninth layer. Taking more than half a year to break into it, Luo Jianqing\u2019s purpose was simple \u2013 to get more Yan fruits and make Xuan Lingzi proud.However, all his efforts were in vain.Because his junior fellow apprentice Li Xiuchen had got hundreds of Yan fruits when he left Liuyan valley one year later.All the people said, \u201cFellow cultivator Li deserves to be the apprentice of Sir Xuan Lingzi!\u201dThinking of here, Luo Jianqing cleared his sore throat and said, \u201cIf it was the ninth layer, why there is no Yan fruit here?\u201dMo Qiu did not reply but just said, \u201cMy injury has not cured yet, and this is the first time I get out of the cave. Luo Jianqing, it is all your fault. If you bring me out earlier, we have already known where this place is.\u201dLuo Jianqing slapped Mo Qiu\u2019s face with his sword,\u201cDon\u2019t beat about the bush.\u201dMo qiu opened his eyes wide and covered his face incredulously, he said,\u201cYou slapped my face!\u201dLuo Jianqing replied, \u201cCultivator Mo, there has been no compatibility between Dao Cultivators and Fiend Cultivators since ancient time. I do not kill you and give you a way out just because of our friendship over the past days.\u201cYou!\u201dAfter getting in a huff for a time of a stick of incense, Mo Qiu glared at Luo Jianqing in anger when Luo Jianqing was going to lift his sword again, he said,\u201cDo you see that Huoyan River? Actually, it is neither a river nor flame, it is blood. In those days, fire Heaven Level Demon Exalt fell here and change into this Liuyan valley. His heart blood remained here and became the Huoyan River. And the astral wind before was the talent of another Heaven Level Demon Exalt. All the people believed that this fire Demon Exalt was killed by the human cultivator. But, as far as I know, he fought a ferocious fight with another demon exalt, and perished together.Luo Jianqing asked, \u201cAccording to what you said, since another Demon Exalt could kill the fire Demon Exalt, why there is Liuyanvalley, not Gangfeng valley?\u201dMo Qiu sneered at Luo Jianqing and looked at him, \u201cYou should ask the elders of Taihua Mountain\u2019 Yuxia peak. They came here and plunder magic treasures every a thousand years. No matter how many magic treasures there were, they would be looted by them. They might also take away this Huoyan River if it was possible. Everybody say Taihua Mountain is the leader of Righteous Party. Bullshit! You people from Yuxiao Peak are the most tricky and slippery. Posing as a person of high moral, you think\u2026 Ah! You dare to slap me again!\u201dLuo Jianqing took away Floating Frost Sword unhurriedly and said, \u201cYou are talking nonsense. How do you know these things since you have cultivated less than fifty years? How dare you slander my elders. Mo Qiu, I\u2019m not kill you today, but if I find you say it again, I must slap you again!\u201dClenching his teeth, Mo Qiu said,\u201cWell, very well, you\u2019d better remember it!\u201dThough Luo Jianqing had quarreled with Mo Qiu like this, in the following days, he still made a cave with Mo Qiuand and cultivated here. Seeing that Mo Qiu did not use any pill medicine that he left before, Luo Jianqing directly got them back.Mo Qiu satirized, \u201cHypocritical cultivator from Taihua Mountain.\u201dLuo Jianqing gave a flick of his sleeve and pulled Mo Qiu in his front.Seeing this, Mo Qiu subconsciously wanted to protect his face for his spirit power had not recovered yet. But unexpectedly, Luo Jianqing\u2019s sword did not fall. Removing his hands in surprise, Mo Qiu only saw Luo Jianqing was operating his spirit power and healing himself.Luo Jianqing said in a cold voice, \u201cCultivator Mo, you get well early and we could come out of here early.Mo Qiu chuckled and thought secretly: That\u2019s more like itPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFour months later, Mo Qiu recovered. And the first thing he did after his recovery was to chase after Luo Jianqing and pound him. This time, Luo Jianqing did not win. But when Mo Qiu was about to throw his whip to that beautiful face, he suddenly stopped.Mo Qiu chuckled and supported Luo Jianqing\u2019s face with whipstock, he said,\u201cOh, how could I was willing to hit the face of such a beauty!\u201dWhen Mo Qiu did not pay attention, Luo Jianqing slapped him with sword scabbardMo Qiu said, \u201cYou!\u201dLuo Jianqing replied, \u201cCultivator Mo please behave yourself.\u201dWhen Luo Jianqing was talking, the cinnabar mole between his eyebrows twinkled.Half a year later, there was another violent astral wind. Not expecting they will encounter astral wind again, these two people hid into the cave under the ground again like a drowned mouse. This time it was Mo Qiu who took control of the Earth Level heaven-demon huge formation, he controlled it in an extremely skill way, which made Luo dazzled.In the channel, Mo Qiu said, \u201cThe gate of Liuyan valley had opened a few months ago, but we did not come out. Mo clan might thought I have died. How about the people of Taihua Mountain, is anyone waiting for you? That person must be nervous seeing you did not come back.A figure in white suddenly flashed across his mind, Luo Jianqing looked down and felt a slight pain in his heart. After a moment, he said, \u201cNobody is waiting. But my life lamp is placed in Taihua Mountain, they know I am still alive.Looking at the disappointed face of Luo Jianqing, Mo Qiu curled his lips in silence.There were no seasons in the valley, nor the passing of time.There was only a gust of astral wind semiannually. Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu had already prepared for this and they would directly hide into the hole in the ground every time.In the second year being trapped in the valley, Luo Jianqing reached the level of Late-stage Gold Core by virtue of the mighty spiritual power in Blood Spirit Fruits. To this, Mo Qiu said with a cold smile: \u201cCongratulations.\u201dLuo Jianqing was in a good mood and ignored the irony in his words.Time flew away quickly just like this. And Luo Jianqing would approach the Burning River every day, intending to enhance himself under the pressure of it. But he failed every time and could not but returned. Strangely, Flame Beasts never attacked Mo Qiu when he wandered around the Burning in boredom.Luo Jianqing said astonishingly: \u201cMo Qiu, why haven\u2019t you been attacked?\u201dMo Qiuqiu joked expressionlessly: \u201cMy level is much higher than that of the stupid fire Demon Exalt of Heaven Level. I could kill him when it was alive. Now it was dead, how dare you speak of the level in front of me.?\u201dLuo gradually said speechlessly: \u201cWould you die if you stopped boasting yourself, Fellow Cultivator Mo ??\u201dMo Qiu sneered but did not answer.In the valley, Luo Jianqing buried himself in the study of Nine Heavenly Seizure Record. He wondered if it were thanks to the Burning River that his cultivation base increased quickly. His body was like a dry sponge that absorbed the spiritual power in the Blood Spirit Fruits enormously.In the third year, Luo Jianqing reached the level of Nascent Soul!It broke the record of Xuan Lingzi. However, Luo Jianqing did not feel that happy. He stared at the Burning River silently, until Mo Qiu said with a smile: \u201cYou reached the level of Nascent Soul in less than 40 years and your nascent soul is so perfect. Good for you. Luo Jianqing, are my Blood Spirit Fruits useful?\u201dLuo Jianqing murmured: \u201cMo Qiu, we really cannot leave here?\u201dMo Qiu stopped talking suddenly. After a while, he took out a jade boat from his Interspatial Ring. The boat was exquisite but could only accommodate three people. It shone \u00a0a cold glisten and bogged down the Burning River for a moment once it landed in the river. It seemed that the river was intimidated by it.Mo Qiu said: \u201cIt\u2019s called Clod Jade Heaven Boat. I found out earlier that, every time the astral wind blew over, the Burning River would calm down for a quarter of an hour. As long as we could get out of the valley at that period, we might be able to escape here.\u201dLuo Jianqing looked at the boat in surprise, and asked after a while: \u201c\u2026you could leave here long time ago, right?\u201dMo Qiu answered with a smile, \u201cWhat! You think that I can leave by myself?\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded heavily: \u201cYes. You are not afraid of the Burning River, and you have magic tools of Heaven Level.\u201d As long as there is no astral wind, you can leave as you like even without the so-called quarter of an hour.However, Mo Qiu raised his brow and said: \u201cYou think too much, Luo Jianqing of Taihua Mountain. What if I came across something more horrible than the astral wind as soon as I get out of the valley? You are now in the level of Nascent Soul, and that\u2019s what I need. Well, the astral wind will come again three days later. Let\u2019s make preparations and get out of the valley as soon as it dies down! \u201dLuo Jianqing cast an unfathomable look at Mo Qiu, and took out a white jade tablet from his Interspatial Ring. He dropped a drop of his blood on it, and gave it to Mo Qiu, saying: \u201cFellow Cultivator, thanks for helping me get out of the valley and your waiting. The tablet is a treasure that I got from a relic. I have discharged the contract on it just now and it is a material without owner. With this tablet, you can move to places thousands of miles away for escaping in a blink.\u201dWithout hesitation, Mo Qiu accepted the jade tablet. He looked at it with a smile and then took out a small blood red bell from his sleeve. When Mo Qiu shook it, it did not make any sound. How strange!Mo Qiu said: \u201cWhat a coincidence. This is called Devil-sounded Bell. I refined it in boredom. It has no other use. But if you put it near your heart, I can hear the bell ring as long as I am within thousands of miles when you are in danger. And I might come to rescue you if I were in a good mood.\u201dThen Mo Qiu threw the Devil-sounded Bell to Luo Jianqing.Luo Jianqing stared at the exquisite bell with a complicated expression and remained still for quite a while.Mo Qiudao: \u201cAre you afraid that I\u2019m gonna hurt you? Whatever, I may not be necessarily happy to save you\u2026\u201dMo Qiu stopped talking abruptly when seeing Luo Jianqing thrusting the bell into his heart at one blow.When the bell entered the body, the cinnabar mole between Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyebrows flashed a while.Mo Qiu opened his eyes widely and saw the cultivator in cyan robe smiling slightly. His smile was as shiny as the spring morning and the moon light, and his voice seemed to come from the heaven: \u201cMo Qiu, you said before that you have numerous ways to kill me even if you can\u2019t move\u201d\u201cYou actually believe that?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s smile became more vigorously, which made him seem more handsome. \u201cYes, I do. You have too many secrets. You know it is the ninth layer of the Liu Yan Valley, and you know the so-called wind Demon Exalt and fire Demon Exalt. Although you were born in the barren cold desert, you own magic tools of Heaven Level that I have never seen before. You can even condense devil Qi before reaching the level of Nascent Soul.\u201dPausing for a while, Luo Jianqing said with a smile: \u201cSince you did not kill me in the past, I believe that you will not kill me in the future. At least you will not kill me with this Devil-sounded Bell. Three-year friendship in the Liu Yan Valley is enough to make me believe you and\u2026 to make us sworn friends for life and death.\u201dMo Qiu changed his expression on the face for a few times and smiled finally: \u201cSworn friends for life and death?\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded: \u201cYes.\u201dMo Qiu spoke again: \u201cI\u2019m a Feign Cultivator.\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled: \u201cI knew.\u201dMo Qiu raised his eyebrows: \u201cSince you knew that, why you still want to be my sworn friend for life and death? Aren\u2019t you afraid being condemned by the other Dao Cultivators?\u201dLuo Jianqing shook his head and said: \u201cWho said the Dao Cultivators are all good people? And who said that the way of Dao is the only right way, and the way of Feign is wrong? There is no absolute line between rightness and wrongness. Even my elders would make mistakes in his life. And the Devil Exalt in the Palace of Devils might also do things living up to his original heart. It is Luo Jianqing who is making friends with you now, but not the first disciple of Taihua Mountain or the so called Dao Cultivator. Mo Qiu, I am nobody but Luo Jianqing.\u201dHearing Luo Jianqing\u2019s words, Mo Qiu showed a strange expression on his face but smiled finally: \u201cGiven your words, you are my sworn friends for life and death!\u201dThe two laughed together.Three days later, another astral wind blew over.The two hid in the tunnel and escaped. Then they ran to the Burning River quickly. Mo Qiu took out the boat of Heaven Leven and they looked at each other.\u201cNow!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOnce the Cold Jade Heaven Boat slid into the river, it dispersed coldness and bleakness.The Burning River turned tranquil for a second, and then flooded with fierce surges. The Heaven Level Treasure was glooming with a light blue luster as if it was fighting this golden flame river. They were an even match. The flame around the ship was slowly frozen. The body of the ship reddened on the contrary.Mo Qiu spoke with seriousness in his voice, \u201cthe cardiac blood of this Demon Exalt is indeed very powerful. I fear that the ship will drown in a minute.\u201dGot the meaning behind his words, Luo Jianqing nodded in agreement, \u201clet\u2019s get to the ship.\u201dThe two was like lightning, leaping into the air. Mo Qiu agilely got to the ship, but Luo Jianqing bumped into some troubles.While he was ten feet away from the Burning River, the Flame Beasts rushed towards him one after another. Luo Jianqing was prepared for this. He lifted the Floating Frost Sword and killed every beast he encountered.The cultivation of Nascent Soul Period plus the weakest quarter of the Burning River!Luo Jianqing treated these beasts like weeds in the garden until he met the golden fire dragon when he was three feet away from the river.Once the dragon saw Luo Jianqing, he blasted a roaring laugh, \u201cit\u2019s you again! Come on, let\u2019s end this\u2026huh!\u201dLuo Jianqing lifted his sword calmly. The Cyan Lotus Nine-swords Deployment cut the now-weakened sixth level fire dragon in half.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026it\u2019s not possible\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing ignored this arrogant fire dragon, he pushed forward one more foot and met a grumpy golden Kylin, who said,\u201cI have no time for nasty human like you. Piss off.\u201dTime was running out. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t care about the despise and disrespect in the Kylin\u2019s words. He moved on. Just before he reached the Clod Jade Heaven Boat, he saw a golden silhouette emerged. Holding a gigantic axe in his hand, a strong muscular man was staring him furiously.Luo Jianqing\u2019s pupil shrank.A high-level Demon Exalt!Feeling the wind created by the beast\u2019s coming axe, Luo Jianqing quickly preceded the Hand Knack in preparation of his final attack. However, seeing the cinnabar mole between Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyebrows gleaming a scarlet light, the beast hesitated, then dispersed in the air and turned back into flame.It happened in a sudden. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t quite know what just happened. Nonetheless, there was no time for him to figure it out. Mo Qiu kept shouting \u201churry up! There\u2019s not much time left\u201d, so Luo Jianqing quickened his steps and got to the ship. The Cold Jade Heaven Boat speeded up, headed towards the exit.There were only two spots which looked like the exit.One was the entrance of the Burning River. The other was the exit of it.Like Mo Qiu said, the Burning River was the cardiac blood of that Heaven Level Demon Exalt. It was creepy to think about what might be at the upstream of the river. The two came into an agreement of heading downstream, but it was the place where the biannual Astral wind originated. There was risk to take this choice. Neither of them knew what\u2019s around the corner.Cold Jade Heaven Boat was navigating on the Burning River in lightning speed. Suddenly, the light dimmed. They entered the cave.This cave seemed to stretch on forever. Embraced by complete darkness, the ship kept moving for a day and a night, but they still didn\u2019t get out of the cave.Luo Jianqing frowned, \u201cMo Qiu, do you know what\u2019s going on?\u201dMo Qiu yawned and spoke with reluctancy, \u201cLuo Jianqing, you are really treating me as if I am an encyclopedia.\u201dThey moved on. The temperature was decreasing from burning to human\u2019s body temperature. Luo Jianqing realized that they already got used to the heat in the Valley of the Flame River where the temperature was high enough to burn a cultivation period disciple. What they were feeling now was the actual normal temperature.The ship went forward. The temperature was getting lower and lower.The river started to freeze when the temperature became subzero. Without any hesitation, Luo Jianqing used the Qi of the Sword to break the ice, while Mo Qiu continued to steer the ship. They made a great team, but the temperature kept decreasing. After the whole river was frozen, Luo Jianqing turned his head to look at Mo Qiu and found his friend was doing the same.They nodded in agreement. Mo Qiu collected the Cold Jade Heaven Boat. They marched on by feet.In an unfamiliar dark place like this, flying was the worst choice. It was true that the Gold Core cultivators were well-managed of the flying skill, but this also made them into a moving target. With faster speed, they were less sensible to the danger around them.Well aware of these details, Luo Jianqing had been a runagate for years, but he was surprised that Mo Qiu was also careful and experienced.Mo Qiu sneered, as if he heard the voice in Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind, \u201cThe number of people who want to kill me was more than the people you ever knew\u201d.They walked along with each other, doing the best they can.Seemingly, danger was far behind them, despite the frozen river. Little by little, Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu relaxed and let go of their vigilance. After ten miles of walking, Mo Qiu made a banter, \u201cthis cave is really deep. We haven\u2019t reached the end for days. I wonder how long it is.\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled, \u201cAs long as there is no danger awaits us.\u201dRight when he finished the sentence, Luo Jianqing felt a breeze passing him. He suddenly stopped, asked Mo Qiu, \u201cDid you feel the wind?\u201dMo Qiu stood and looked around vigilantly, \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t\u201d.They guarded up again. After Luo Jianqing walked on for a hundred meters, the wind blew his black hair, lightly touching his cheek. Eyes wide open, Luo Jianqing was shocked, \u201cThere\u2019s wind!\u201dA cyan sword light flew towards the origin of the wind.The sword light seemed like swallowed by the darkness, made no sound, no hit, no anything.Dangers in the dark were always more difficult to deal with than that in the open light. Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu had no fear in their hearts, instead, they sped on. The wind was getting stronger and stronger, from breeze to storm, then from storm to whirlwind!When the fierce Astral wind came in, Luo Jianqing lifted his sword while Mo Qiu wielded his whip.They were able to fight with it in the beginning, but when they moved forward, the Astral wind was even stronger. After ten miles marching in the wind, the Astral wind stabbed Luo Jianqing\u2019s shoulder. He moaned with blood oozing out of his mouth.Mo Qiu was worried about him, \u201cBe careful!\u201dLuo Jianqing took out a Xuan Level defense instrument from the Interspatial Ring and put it on. The instrument was cut into powders by the Astral wind, but it did keep out some attacks.Mo Qiu said, \u201cHurry up! Let\u2019s get out of this place!\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded.With no hesitation, they pulled out their best instruments to fight against this fearful Astral wind and moved forward. One mile, two miles, three miles\u2026\u2026 when they finally saw the light, Luo Jianqing got four or five wounds on his body; Mo Qiu was no better than him.The Astral wind was as strong as a Out-of-Body Level cultivator\u2019s most powerful attack. The instruments in Luo Jianqing\u2019s Interspatial Ring were almost all broken. Mo Qiu stopped to pull out instruments. They flew to the exit, against the violent wind.A thousand meters, a hundred meters, ten meters\u2026\u2026Three meters!At this moment, a frightening Astral wind rushed towards them from their back. Wanted to get out of the cave as quick as possible, Luo Jianqing speeded up, but the wind reached his clothes. The breath of the wind was strong enough to strip a slice of bleeding flesh from Luo Jianqing\u2019s back. He spat out blood.Bang!Luo Jianqing was kicked out of the cave.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe dropped into a magnificent river. The wound was hurting like fire burning on his back. There was not much spiritual power left in his body. Still, he turned himself toward the cave calling his partner, \u201cMo Qiu! Mo Qiu!\u201dA voice uttered inside the cave. Mo Qiu said, \u201cNo worries. The Astral wind isn\u2019t a big deal for me. I have a Heaven Level instrument which can deliver me to\u2026\u2026home. Luo Jianqing, my home is far away from here. There will be a long time until we see each other again.\u201dThe pain was almost unbearable, but Luo Jianqing still shouted, \u201cDon\u2019t you lie to me, Mo Qiu. You kicked me out of the cave. Is it because you can\u2019t make it\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cFxxk off! Why can\u2019t you believe me, huh? Never mind, I\u2019m not gonna waste my time on you. Leaving now.\u201dA beam of scarlet light glimmered from the dark cave entrance. A mysterious vibe was dispersing in the air, with the unique threatening sense of feeling from the Heaven Level instrument. The light dimmed. Luo Jianqing felt\u2026\u2026Mo Qiu had left indeed.Luo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dHis mouth twitched speechlessly, and then he burst into a laugh.Luo Jianqing laughed for quite some time and finally passed out because of tiredness. Tired and beaten, he drifted with the edgeless river, moving along with waves and tides. A vivid cinnabar mole surrounded by a four-petaled lotus was right between his eyebrows. Every time when arrogant Earth Level beasts tried to get near him, the cinnabar mole would glitter and repel them.The wound on his back stopped bleeding, but Luo Jianqing still remained unconscious.He had no idea how long he had been floating in this river. Neither did he know that he already followed the river from the ninth layer of Liu Yan Valley to the first layer. He passed a gigantic waterfall and suddenly broke a light red ward. Then he kept drifting on.The scenery around him was constantly changing. Eyes shut tight and face pale, the handsome cultivator in cyan was floating in the trickling river from stark forest to bustling village. An old woman who was doing laundry saw the young man lying in the middle of the river. She was shocked and screamed, \u201cHelp\u2026 a dead body!\u201dWhen Luo Jianqing woke up, a humble rooftop was what fulfilled his sight.Smelled the light aroma of fully cooked rice, Luo Jianqing tried moving his fingers and arms. He saw an old woman walked in while he was getting out of the bed.The tableware in her hands dropped on the ground when she saw him. After a while of complete silence, the women asked carefully, \u201cYou\u2026you awake?\u201dIt was until then Luo Jianqing knew what was going on.The village was called \u2018Gu Village\u2019 which was built along one of the branches of the Luo River. There were only forty-six households in the entire village. All of the villagers lived on the Luo River. That day, Grandma Gu was doing laundry by the river, and that was when she saw Luo Jianqing in the middle of the water.Grandma Gu thought Luo Jianqing was surely dead, but after the villagers got him out of the river, they found him still alive. Warm-hearted grandma Gu brought Luo Jianqing home and took care of him for forty days.Pouring congee into the bowls, grandma Gu said, \u201cin the morning, my husband went out for farming. He won\u2019t come back until the night falls. Jianqing, if you don\u2019t mind, you can stay here and have a rest.\u201dWith all the gratitude in his heart, Luo Jianqing took over the congee from grandma Gu and said gently, \u201cthank you\u201d.Grandma Gu waved her hand, \u201cthere\u2019s no need for \u2018thanks\u2019, really. A gorgeous child like you must have been through something terrible to lose a chunk of flesh on the back. Although I am only a vulgar woman from the countryside, I know you are not a mortal. You remain alive even if after lying in the middle of the river! Speaking of this, Jianqing, how old are you?\u201dThought it over, Luo Jianqing told her his real age, \u201cI\u2019m forty years old.\u201dEyes wide open, grandma Gu couldn\u2019t believe what she heard, \u201cyou look like a twenty-year-old! There\u2019s no way you are already forty!\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled but said nothing.\u201cForty\u2026my son would be forty-year-old if he were still alive\u201d, grandma Gu put some food in Luo Jianqing\u2019s bowl, \u201cbut Jianqing, you are immortal, right? I heard that these beings can be forever young and are all beautiful like you.\u201dPaused for a moment, Luo Jianqing lifted his head and looked at the woman, \u201cI am no immortal, but grandma\u2026\u2026you\u2019ve seen one before?\u201dGrandma Gu nodded, \u201cyeah, about three years ago, he befell at our yard and gave us some herbs. He was gorgeous. He said that we didn\u2019t have much time left to live, but the herbs can prolong our lives.\u201dThe words touched a secret part in Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart. He asked, \u201cWhy\u2026 did he prolong your lives?\u201dGrandma Gu responded, \u201che told us that one day in the future there will be someone \u2013 maybe his disciple \u2013 coming here to break the bond or something. Well, I don\u2019t quite know what he was saying, but the herbs were working pretty well. My husband is seventy years old this year. He\u2019s still very strong and healthy. You know, he even goes out to do the planting.\u201d\u201cBang\u2014\u2014\u201dLuo Jianqing dropped the chopsticks on the table.He turned his head slowly, staring the wrinkled visage of the grandma with a complicated gaze. He looked at her eyes which containing gentleness and kindness; he looked at her wrinkles with all the years and ages hidden within; he finally put his eyes on her visage. Mouth puckered, he went into silence for a long time.This time, Luo Jianqing stayed.Although his spiritual power only recovered for thirty percent, although the wound on his back still needed time to heal, if Luo Jianqing was keen to leave, he could leave anytime.He stayed, no matter what.That night, grandpa Gu went home. Grandma Gu cooked a hearty meal which triggered a laugh from the grandpa, \u201cJianqing just regained consciousness today. He can\u2019t eat all this feast! You should prepare something easy to digest!\u201dGrandma Gu tapped her own forehead, \u201cOh my. I almost forget.\u201dSilently, Luo Jianqing looked at the meals that occupied the whole table, couldn\u2019t calm down his mind.While eating, grandma Gu said, \u201chusband, do you know that Jianqing reaches his forty this year?\u201dGrandpa Gu\u2019s eyes widened, staring at Luo Jianqing, \u201cforty\u2026\u2026forty? The same age as our son?\u201dGrandma Gu smiled and nodded.Somber yellow light was slowly wobbling in the narrow shabby house. Cultivating, Luo Jianqing sat cross-legged on the bed. He had just broken the Nascent Soul Period. If not that he needed to get out of the valley as soon as possible, he should have been consolidating the Period a long time ago. Now, however, he couldn\u2019t calm down and cultivate.He heard the snoring of grandpa Gu; he heard the breathing of grandma Gu; he heard the mating call of the frog outside; he heard the jingling sound of water from the running Luo River.Finally, Luo Jianqing got out of the bed, walked into the yard, and looked up to the sky.There happened to be a full moon. Slowly touching the earth, the moonlight was as limpid as water.Confusion emerged on the comely face of the cultivator. The starry eyes were filled with haze. He was standing in the Gu Village. However, he felt like he was standing in the middle of the lively capital city, or at the desolate top of the Yu Xiao Peak.Enjoying the precious tranquil night, Luo Jianqing closed his eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn the morning of the next day, grandma Gu saw Luo Jianqing in the yard. She was shocked, \u201cJianqing, why did you wake up this early? It\u2019s cold outside. Come in. You can\u2019t bear the coldness with these clothes.\u201dSmiling, Luo Jianqing took over the shoulder pole from grandma Gu, \u201cmay I help you with cooking?\u201dThe bright smile of the young man dazzled grandma Gu. She came to her senses after a while, and nodded, \u201csure!\u201dThat day, Luo Jianqing helped grandma Gu with preparing breakfast. After the meal, grandpa Gu was leaving for laboring in the field. Luo Jianqing asked, \u201cCan I join you?\u201dGrandpa wasn\u2019t expecting him to say that, but still, he responded in joy, \u201cof course!\u201dWith no spiritual power or enchantment, Luo Jianqing held the delicate rice seedling in his hands and carefully put it in the muddy ground. Grandpa Gu laughed, and pointed out his mistakes, then taught him how to fix the angle of the seedling.After a whole day of laboring, Luo Jianqing\u2019s beautiful face was distained with mud.Days like this passed by uneventfully.There was nothing more special compared to a stranger coming to the Gu Village, especially when the stranger was very gorgeous. Luo Jianqing charmed a lot of girls from the village. Even the most beautiful one couldn\u2019t help herself giving Luo Jianqing a red flower as a gift and then ran away with blushing cheeks.Luo Jianqing held the shoulder poke in one hand, looking at the red flower in his hand.Just like the visage of the girl, the flower was so delicate, composing by youth and ages.Luo Jianqing refused all the proposals, and shook his head to every villagers who wanted to introduce a girl to him. He lived with grandpa and grandma Gu, helping them with cooking, laundry, laboring, and cleaning like he became a part of the family. He never treated a task with carelessness. Although he was wearing shabby clothes, he was elegant like an immortal.In the winter, heavy rain swept the Gu Village which led to a flood.That night, Luo Jianqing and grandpa Gu went to the field to check the plants. Grandpa Gu slipped.Luo Jianqing tried to catch him.He failed.He forgot he was a cultivator who could use the spiritual power. He tried to catch grandpa Gu with a mortal body and didn\u2019t make it.Grandpa Gu was ill because of the accident and couldn\u2019t get out of bed. Grandma Gu and Luo Jianqing took care of him day after day, night after night. The villagers brought gifts to the family. The pretty girl who gave Luo Jianqing a flower brought a quilt. When she was about to leave, she said in a soft voice, \u201cthat day, I saw you floating on the river as well, but I was too frightened to shout out.\u201dAvoided eye contact, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t respond.Ten days later, grandpa Gu\u2019s illness was more acute. The three years in the Liu Yan Valley left Luo Jianqing an empty Interspatial Ring. He wanted to use his own spiritual power to prolong grandpa Gu\u2019s life. However, right before he was about to do this, grandma Gu was wiping grandpa Gu\u2019s body and mumbling, \u201cthe immortal told us that his disciple will come to us to break the bond. There aren\u2019t many days left for my husband. Why is it that he hasn\u2019t show up\u2026\u2026\u201d?Luo Jianqing lost his words.Three days after, grandpa\u2019s condition became worse and lost his eyesight. He should have been dead three years ago but he managed to live till now due to the herbs.Before his death, grandpa got a momentary recovery of consciousness and said a lot to grandma Gu. He talked about their encounter, their early marriage days, their days without a child, their memory about abandoning their son into the Luo River.Luo Jianqing was listening quietly and sat beside grandpa Gu when the patient beckoned him.With a kind smile on his face, Grandpa Gu gently held Luo Jianqing\u2019s hands. He stared at the young man carefully, didn\u2019t say a word. After a long time of silence, he said, \u201cJianqing, for a year of living together, I have always considered you as my son. Now it\u2019s time for me to leave. Can you call me \u2018dad\u2019 for one sole time?\u201dMouth shut tight, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t say anything.This didn\u2019t annoy him, Grandpa Gu shook his head, \u201cthis is indeed too much to ask from you\u201d.He beckoned to his wife, \u201cI know that he is not a monster. He is our son. Xi, my wife, I remember the day when I proposed. I picked your favorite azalea. They looked good in your hair. The sunset was beautiful that day, but, I remember, you are even more beautiful than the magnificent light.\u201dGrandma Gu showed a subtle smile, \u201cnext life, I will still decorate my hair with azalea. You will know it\u2019s me when you see the flower.\u201dGrandpa Gu nodded.They embraced each other. A relieving smile emerged on the visage of grandpa Gu. His eyes were slowly closing, and that\u2019s when he heard a voice saying \u201cdad\u2026\u2026\u201dHis eyes glimmered and then closed forever.A drop of tear slid down.Ten days after grandpa Gu\u2019s death, grandma Gu had gradually lost her health. Luo Jianqing started to take care of this lonely woman. He played his role as a good listener, staying by her side for her story of the younger romantic days and her poor daughter who died several years ago.Three months later, grandma Gu couldn\u2019t get herself out of bed anymore. That day, she held Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand, just like grandpa Gu, suddenly found back her energy and said a lot of words.\u201cWhen I was young, believe me, I was the prettiest girl in this region so that I once had a high expectation for my future husband. That day, under the sunset, I saw him holding an enormous bouquet of azalea with a silly smile hanging on his face. I was thinking \u2018wow, that man looks so funny\u2019, and then we were married.\u201cI wasn\u2019t able to give birth to a child until the twelfth year of our marriage. He didn\u2019t mind at all, but the villagers were foul-mouthed. In the twelfth year, we had a baby who opened his eyes and smiled at the moment he was born. He had beautiful eyes which would bend like the new moon when he smiled. They were even saying that I\u2019ve given birth to a little girl.\u201cBut every time he smiled, there were thunders came from the firmament hovering over the Gu Village. I never knew thunder could be that terrifying. It didn\u2019t stop for three days and three nights. At the same time, the Luo River became crystal clear\u2026very clear. It was so clear that I could see lots of shrimp and fish beneath the surface. I lived here for dozens of years but that was the first time I knew there were so many creatures in the Luo River.\u201cThen, we put him inside a bucket and let him float away along the river.\u201cAnywhere his bucket touched, tranquil befallen. The fish and shrimp all scattered away, but the thunder followed.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Dropping on the ground without a sound, the rain in spring was light and mild. When Luo Jianqing stood up to shut the windows, he heard an old kind voice said something before he even turned his back.\u201cNiansheng, how are you these years?\u201dLuo Jianqing was petrified.\u201cAre your step-parents treating you well? Do you have any siblings? Where do you live? Are you married?\u201dLuo Jianqing was standing still, didn\u2019t turn his head.Coughing while smiling, grandma Gu said, \u201cI forgot that you went to learn how to be an immortal. Your master must have been nice to you. Is he\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cGrandma Gu!\u201dHeard Luo Jianqing\u2019s words, grandma Gu quivered and slowly shut up her mouth.After a long silence, grandma Gu wiped out the tears and said in a cracked voice, \u201cour second child was a girl. We named her Gu Amei and gave her a nickname \u2018Niansheng\u2019. She was beautiful, married to a young man from another village. She died because of dystocia. Her husband didn\u2019t marry until the third year by when he suddenly became rich and married another girl. My daughter, however, didn\u2019t have a chance to enjoy her life for even one day.\u201cWhen I was little, I heard the elders talking about karma. My son only lived a few days after his birth. Amei inherited his name, and, just like my husband and I, was cursed by that.\u201dStaring at the ground, Luo Jianqing was still facing the window.\u201cThe villagers are saying that we are nice and kind, but they don\u2019t know we are always haunted by our dreams. I remember one night I had a dream in which my son came back and told me he was scared of the thunder. He told me that it was cold lying in the Luo River.\u201cMy husband and I didn\u2019t have a single peaceful night for twenty-seven years until the immortal came.\u201cIt was our karma. We did something wrong\u2026\u2026to our own child.She choked with sobs. Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help himself but turned his head. He saw the old woman was crying. The quilt was wetted by the tears. She was crying and shivering uncontrollably.Luo Jianqing made his way towards grandma Gu. Before he could say anything, she said, \u201cthree years ago, the immortal told us that we were about to leave this world. We told them that we did not want to live any longer as well. What we really wanted was death, so that we could reunite\u00a0 with our children. However, the immortal said that our son was still waiting for us\u2026\u2026waiting for us to break the bond that connected our family.\u201cWe asked him where our Niansheng was.\u201d\u201cHe told us\u2026\u2026that we would know when the time is right.\u201d\u201cWe managed to live another three years just because of his words. Actually, we didn\u2019t eat the herbs. That\u2019s surely a precious thing. We want to give it to our Niansheng. We\u2019ve been wondering for three years how he\u2019s gonna look like.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s in his late thirties. Maybe he has a wonderful life. Maybe he already had his own family now, with beautiful wife and lovely child. Maybe he\u2019s like that immortal. So gorgeous. So kind. Befallen our yard one day and told us he\u2019s coming to cut the bond.\u201d\u201cWhen that day came, I was doing laundry. I saw a man floating in the middle of the river. I took a gleam when he was rescued ashore, and I knew, at that moment, this is my son.\u201d\u201cMy Niansheng is even more handsome than I ever imagined.\u201cHe is so gorgeous, so nice. We don\u2019t deserve a son like this. I know, after my death, he\u2019s gonna be an immortal. It\u2019s good. He should be one. He doesn\u2019t need parents like us. Then what\u2019s the meaning of\u2026\u2026our bond?\u201d\u201cMom\u2026\u2026\u201d Luo Jianqing sobbed.Grandma Gu suddenly lifted her head, staring at the handsome young man standing in front.It was after a while before she beckoned him finally.\u201cNiansheng, how are you\u2026\u2026these years?\u201dShe said the words with extreme carefulness and mild voice as if she didn\u2019t want to scare him.Luo Jianqing held her hand and nodded, \u201cmy life is very satisfying.\u201d\u201cDo you have any child?\u201dLuo Jianqing shook his head.\u201cAre you married?\u201dHe nodded, \u201cI have somebody that I really like.\u201dGrandma Gu beamed with pleasure, \u201cit\u2019s good\u2026\u2026it\u2019s good.\u201dThe light kindled in the house. The thunder and lightning outside couldn\u2019t disturb the peaceful kind vibe within. Grandma Gu was very happy. She said a lot as if she had countless things to tell Luo Jianqing. It was till the sunrise her voice became weaker and weaker.In the end, grandma Gu was leaning on Luo Jianqing\u2019s chest and mumbling, \u201cthat day, I was the one who decided to abandon you, not your father\u2026\u2026it\u2019s true, not your father. We regretted before we got to our house. We found a ship and searched you around in the Luo River but couldn\u2019t find you\u2026\u2026we really couldn\u2019t find you. We found a lot of money in our house after we returned. We hid them all under this bed. Take the money. They are yours. We didn\u2019t even tell Amei\u2026\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded hard.Looking right into this handsome man, Grandma Gu lifted her head. She looked at him as if she didn\u2019t want to leave this world, not after she finally had the chance to look at her son. She smiled slowly, \u201cyour master must have been treating you well. Niansheng, his eyes were beaming with delight when he spoke of you.\u201dLuo Jianqing couldn\u2019t move his body.She was still speaking, \u201cyour master spat out lots of blood when he left. You must take good care of him.\u201dShivering in shock, Luo Jianqing widened his eyes.Grandma Gu\u2019s eyes were slowly closing. Voice weakening and fingers losing strength, using the last bit of her energy, she still gazed at Luo Jianqing. A relieving smile emerged, for one second, she became the beautiful girl who enchanted every young man in the region dozens of years ago.She said, \u201cNiansheng, our bond\u2026\u2026was cut.\u201d\u201cSplat\u2014\u2014\u201dHer arm dropped at the moment she finished the sentence.Stupified, Luo Jianqing held the old woman in his arms. A long-time passed. His tears were finally running out.He felt something inside him vanished at the moment grandma Gu stopped her breath. That thing was constraining him for forty-one years, and he didn\u2019t notice it at all. It was the bond between the family which was buried at the deepest corner in his heart and was broken following grandma Gu\u2019s last words.What was the meaning of breaking the mortal bond?Must we become indifferent of love and hate to be immortal?Thunder was roaring in the firmament. Countless lightning was rushing towards the ground like silver snakes. Then a heavy rain followed.In terrible weather like this, Luo Jianqing buried grandma Gu with grandpa Gu. He knelt before the tombstone, kowtowed forty-one times, and then using Sword Qi left a phrase on the tombstone:\u2018by their son \u2013 Gu Niansheng\u2019The last bit of the bond had disappeared. Luo Jianqing looked up at the sky. There was nothing but coldness and anger on his face,\u201cWho\u2019s to blame for the flood and thunder forty-one years ago?\u201cWhy the fate asked me to break the mortal bond?\u201cWhy is it that we have to be indifferent to immortal?\u201cWhy do we need to leave behind the love and hate?\u201cI, Luo Jianqing, swear that I will succeed with all the mortal emotions still inside me.\u201dEmerging and rumbling from the underground, an ancient invisible power accumulated around Luo Jianqing.This was the Third Seizure of the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record \u2013 Seizing Right and Wrong!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayUnder the downpour, a figure in cyan stood alone in the forest.It was raining cats and dogs. With tremendous thunder and lightning, the whole region was shaken. Gazing at the sky, Luo Jianqing stood in this terrifying weather. It was just like the weather which befell the Gu Village forty-one years ago. The rain dropped into the Luo River which meandered thousands of miles. There seemed no end for the countless lightning.Instead of turbid, the Luo River turned crystal clear by the rain drops.Shrimp and fish were swimming. The mountains ashore were connected by their reflections in the river, and their dim outline was looming in the rain. The Luo River not only ran for an enormous distance, but it was no mild river. The cultivator in cyan stood at the top of the mountain gazing at the vast Luo River but couldn\u2019t find its end; it was majestic and stirring, just like the fearful firmament.It was in the rain that Luo Jianqing saw the imaginary images of the couple.The villagers had nothing for their child but hate and curse. They put that little chubby boy into a bucket along with enough quilt against the cold, enough foods against the starvation, and enough canvas against the rain. Crying as if their heart was broken, they put the bucket into the water and watched it floating along with the river.The thunder went away following the departure of the child.The water turned clear everywhere the bucket touched. The vibe around the child was always tranquil and steady. The couple ashore was wailing. Finally, the young man dragged the weeping lady away. The crying sound from the bucket gradually ceased as well.Sighed, Luo Jianqing let go of this image before that familiar white figure appeared.Thunder was roaring in the sky as if it aimed to demolish the mountain. Luo Jianqing closed his eyes instead.Forty-one years ago in the peaceful Gu Village, after twelve years of marriage, Gu Qi and his wife finally had their first child. The baby boy was gorgeous. Wishing him to be like a young willow \u2013 growing fast and ever-green \u2013 they named him Gu Willow.Gu Willow was smart and bright. He went to a school in the village at the age of six to learn how to read and write from a Xiucai. It was not until he turned twelve that his teacher realized he was outsmarted. Gu Willow\u2019s teacher wrote a letter of recommendation and sent him to study in town.When Gu Willow was leaving the village, Gu Sixteen gave him a box of candy as a goodbye gift and said in lovely voice, \u201cyou know how to read, while I know how to cook\u201d.The girl in buns was bravely expressing her love, but Gu Willow was blushing.With simple luggage, Gu Willow went to the town to study. He got the first place in the Town Test and the Province Test, and stayed at the top 1 for all the tests along the way to the capital city. The emperor endorsed him as Tanhua (number three in national civil examinations), and then gave him the courtesy name of Fengzhang. With great achievement, Gu Willow returned his hometown. He smelled the aroma of cooked rice before he even stepped into the village.The subordinate asked, \u201cTanhua Gu, is there any tasty famous food in your hometown?\u201dGu Willow didn\u2019t have time to answer because he saw a pretty girl came out of a house built at the end of the street. She rushed towards him. Looking shy while saying something bold, \u201cGu Willow, you come back with knowledge and I am good at cooking now\u201d.With a blush on his face, Gu Willow married Gu Sixteen a year later.Although Gu Willow was just a Tanhua, within ten years he impeached several corrupt officials who once held great power in their hands. On the outside, he was the ruthless censor; once a year gave the emperor a world-shaking suggestion and bet his life with it; even the emperor couldn\u2019t say no to him. On the inside, he was a perfect husband; although they didn\u2019t have any child, he was doing all he could to take care of Gu Sixteen with love, care, and gentleness.They were well-known for their loving stories.When Gu Willow was forty, he became a member of the Cabinet and went to the battlefield to over-watch the army, while Gu Sixteen was sobbing every day back home.When Gu Willow was fifty, while the colleagues around his age all had a big family and countless offspring, Gu Willow and Gu Sixteen only had each other.When Gu Willow was sixty, holding tremendous power in his hands, he became the prime minister. He was still ruthless and just \u2013 a nightmare of the greedy negligent officials.When Gu Willow was seventy, a new emperor took over the throne. Believed the obloquy, the new emperor was dread of the power of the prime minister and sentenced the old good man death. The whole city cried for three days and three nights.Youth had already left Gu Sixteen. That day, she held her husband\u2019s cinerary urn for a long time and gently buried it underground. She sat in front of the tombstone for three days and left abruptly. Gu Sixteen came back with a lunch box which was filled with fully cooked rice.\u201cYou know how to read\u2026\u2026while I know how to cook\u201d.After having the rice, Gu Sixteen rushed towards the gravestone and commit suicide.All of these was frozen into an image.Again, the time came back to forty-one years ago. Gu Qi and his wife had a child. That year there was little rain in the village. All the plants were died because of the drought. The couple named their baby Gu Wish, wishing him and the family a bright future. A better future.Playing every single day, Gu Wish was very naughty. He hates studying. His parents never ceased to worry about his future.This time, Gu Sixteen didn\u2019t make it to be born into this world. Her mother had a stillborn. Following his parents and playing his toy, Gu Wish visited this lady who had just lost her child.With just seven-year-old, Gu Wish was weirdly strong. Noticing that, his parents sent him to learn martial arts with a veteran.At twelve years old, Gu Wish enlisted. Still looking for candy before he took his leave, he didn\u2019t treat this seriously. There was nobody except his parents said goodbye to him, only several girls who were enchanted by his handsome visage but soon called back by their parents, \u201cthat boy has nothing but a pretty face. He won\u2019t succeed but die in the battlefield sooner or later.\u201dGu Wish stopped to stare at the direction where the voice originated.When he was thirteen years old, Gu Wish fought in the war for the first time. He earned himself a lot of medals and was promoted Qianfu Zhang when he was seventeen. He saved the general\u2019s life once, and by that chance, impressed by both his appearance and his skills, the general started to endorse him.At last, when Gu Wish was twenty, they ended the war with a great victory. Came back to the capital city as a soldier who proved his braveness, Gu Wish was complimented by the emperor himself. However, Gu Wish didn\u2019t like the vibe of party. While wandering alone in the garden, he bumped into a girl who was practicing her sword.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You, a hero?\u201dGu Wish held his head up high, \u201csaid so by Your Majesty\u201d.Her eyes glimmered and held the sword up, \u201cthen, hero, do you dare take my challenge!\u201d\u201cWhy not!\u201dThey fought with excitement in the yard. At last, the girl was defeated. Tried to break Gu Wish\u2019s constrain but failed, she sighed, \u201creally? You are just like what was said by my father \u2013 having nothing but strength and having no idea how to behave yourself!\u201dThree years later, Gu Wish married the general\u2019s only daughter \u2013 Ying Niang.The emperor himself even gave them a blessing.They had their first child in the second year of their marriage, and had three boys within five years. When the time reached the tenth year, Ying Niang refused to give birth to another one. Gu Wish couldn\u2019t do anything about it, so he put all his energy into teaching his six sons martial arts.When Gu Wish was thirty, Ying Niang\u2019s father \u2013 the old general \u2013 was killed in the war. Followed the new emperor\u2019s order, Gu Wish went to the battlefield. Wherever he went, death and demolish followed. They wined the war with no doubt. He beheaded the general of their enemy and brought the head back home. He held his wife tight and comforted her gently.When Gu Wish was fifty years old, he held great power in his hands. His six sons all became famous generals.When Gu Wish was sixty years old, the suspicious emperor beckoned him to the palace. It was a party, but Gu Wish\u2019s last one.The emperor gave him a death sentence along with a glass of poisoned wine.Gu Wish laughed instead, and asked, \u201cthere\u2019s only one thing I want to know \u2013 what did I do wrong?\u201dThe emperor sighed, \u201cGeneral Gu, that is your mistake \u2013 you did nothing wrong\u201d.Gu Wish drank the wine and stroke the glass on the ground. He rode the horse rushing towards General Palace, but life was slipping away. He died half-way home. The horse took him all the way home as if it knew what his owner was determined.Under the moonlight, when Ying Niang came out of the General Palace, she saw his hero still wearing the army attire, sitting on the horseback, and eyes wide open.Ying Niang was shivering. , Kneeling on the ground, their six sons swore to revenge.However, Ying Niang said, \u201cYour father was the hero of this country. He owed nothing to the country, the emperor, or the citizens. The former emperor gave him the title of \u2018Hero\u2019. How can you guys discredit his honor?\u201d\u201cMother!\u201d\u201cTake your father off from the horseback and bring him to my room. I still have a lot of words\u2026\u2026hadn\u2019t had a chance to tell him.\u201dThat night, the General Palace didn\u2019t turn off light for the whole night. The old lady sat beside the bed and held her husband\u2019s hand, mumbling, \u201cHonestly, I knew who you were when we first met each other, Gu Wish. My father told me that he found someone who would achieve greatness in the future. He wished me to marry that guy but I hated that.\u201cHow could he decide whom I will marry? Me, Ying Niang, was famous in the capital city. I was not like the other girls who will obey their parents\u2019 arrangement.\u201cThe day you entered the yard, you were wearing the same white attire.\u201cYou held my hands. I could feel my heartbeat. It was like \u2018boom, boom, boom\u2019. The beat went on and on.\u201cYou tramp. Rather to die as a hero instead of to live as a traitor. You were everyone\u2019s hero, but my tramp.\u201d\u2026\u2026She kept talking until the sunrise. The old lady got out of the room and took out her sword. She started practicing the sword just like forty years ago. She was still beautiful and powerful as if nothing had changed \u2013 she was playing her sword in the middle of the yard and he was watching her in the darkness, they got to know each other and then fell in love.The sword was dropped on the ground. What following it was the body of Ying Niang.The General Palace hung up white curtains.Ying Niang died on the same day with Gu Willow. This was what was called \u2013 no need for the same date of birth but beg for the same date of death.The six generals were in wrath and planned to overthrow the emperor, but were defeated by the well-prepared Majesty who destroyed the whole General Palace with no mercy.Several years after this, the once magnificent General Palace was now shabby and poor. No one ever remembered once there was a teenager from a common village step by step became a great hero of the country.Again, forty-one years ago, Gu Qi and his wife had a child. They named him Gu Zhen. Gu Zhen chose business as his work field but lost a tremendous amount of money in the end. Even his old wife hung herself and committed suicide. They left nothing but an idiotic son.Another forty-one years ago, this time his name was Gu Cheng. He was a hardworking farmer and very good at agricultural tactic. He married Gu Sixteen at the right time. They had a wonderful life together.\u2026\u2026The ninth forty-one years ago, Gu Qi and his wife named their child Gu Niansheng.Gu Niansheng was handsome and very clever. When he was seven, an immortal came to the Gu Village to find himself an apprentice. That immortal in white robe fixed his eyes on Gu Niansheng, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d\u201cMy\u2026\u2026my name is Gu Niansheng.\u201d\u201cWhy \u2018Niansheng\u2019?\u201dHe shook his head, \u201cI have no idea.\u201dDidn\u2019t care much on his answer, the immortal waved his hand, \u201cI\u2019m Xuan Lingzi. You come with me to the Tai Hua Mountain. You can follow me and be my disciple.\u201dKnowing nothing, Gu Niansheng followed his parents and kneeled before the immortal. When he was about to leave, his parents held his hands and kept telling him to be a good student.\u201cDad, mom, can I still come back and visit?\u201dBefore his parents could answer, Xuan Lingzi said, \u201cto be an immortal, you have to leave no bond in the common world. Now, you are given the chance to break the bond between your parents and yourself. After this, you will have the freedom the commoners never have a chance to enjoy, and then, you could step on the journey to learn how to be an immortal.\u201d\u201cNo!\u201d Said Gu Niansheng, \u201cwhy do I have to abandon my parents?\u201dXuan Lingzi gazed at him, \u201cdo you want to be an immortal?\u201dThe wrath slowly disappeared. Gu Niansheng looked up and smiled, \u201cMaster, I want to be immortal, but I don\u2019t want to be a creature with no love, no hate, nor sympathy. I won\u2019t break the bond linking my parents and I, nor which linking you and me. If it is true that only indifference can lead a person to the road of immortal, then why, can you tell me, that forty-one years ago you came to the Luo River, rescued me, and made me your first disciple?\u201dSuddenly, everything around Gu Niansheng \u2013 including Xuan Lingzi \u2013 froze like statues.Step by step, Gu Niansheng made his way up to the sky, while his figure slowly transformed into Luo Jianqing.Nine phantasms. Every single one of them was diminishing Luo Jianqing\u2019s determination.There was a saying: \u2018all the relationships and bonds bring only agony, then why keep them? There is only one way \u2013 put them into demolition!\u2019Luo Jianqing gently touched Xuan Lingzi\u2019s face and showed him a smile with indulgence, \u201cyou came to the Gu Village just for me; you prolonged my parents\u2019 lives in order to create a chance for me to break the bond. Wu Yin, do you really want me to be an immortal with\u2026\u2026no love, no hate, no anything? Then, given that you\u2019ve spat blood for me, who am I to you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWith fingertips gentle touching, Luo Jianqing lowered his head and kissed Xuan Lingzi\u2019s lips. All were fake in the phantasm. However, Luo Jianqing felt it real. The touching of the lips was soft and gentle. It had Sir Xuan Lingzi\u2019s love. Although all the emotions were confined in the Yu Xiao Peak, just like what Xuan Lingzi said, the respected immortal hadn\u2019t broken the mortal bond.The next moment, all the phantasm vanished.Tremendous energy burst out from Luo Jianqing. The power transformed into a whip, releasing energy into its surroundings. Whipping and striking, Luo Jianqing twisted the whole dimension. A roaring sound came out from the firmament. There was thunder hidden in the clouds but never really hit the ground.\u201cIn chaos we born; over wrong and right we bring; but who\u2019s in the position to say which is right or not\u201d.\u201cThey say heartless lead to immortal. They say indifference is the basic of cultivation\u201d.\u201cThen what is immortal and what is cultivation?!\u201d\u201cMy fate is controlled by myself, not by God! The bond linking me and my parents, I won\u2019t let go of it! The bond linking me to my master, I won\u2019t let go of it as well!\u201d\u201cNine Heavenly Seizure Record! The Third Seizure \u2013 Seizing Right and Wrong!\u201dBoom!Ferocious spiritual power flooded out over the whole Gu Village then converged with the Luo River.Surprisingly, nothing was hurt nor taken away by that enormous power. Instead, it stroked over all the creatures that existed in the world, studying and observing everything as if it was eager to know what was truly right and what was truly wrong.But that was a question which remained unanswered for tens of thousands of years.Standing in the rain, Luo Jianqing looked up at the sky. In that very moment, the rain suddenly stopped, but the clouds were still shrouding over.Something that had lost in him for a quite long time emerged again. Entangled Luo Jianqing for forty-one years, this strong emotion was ignited by his parents, who gave him flesh and blood, and Luo Jianqing could never put that into disdain. Hatred or complain, it was what Luo Jianqing had to carry on himself; it was his decision to choose whether or not to break their bond.Luo Jianqing stood in front of the tomb for forty-one days, as if he was trying to mend what he missed for forty-one years. When he finally turned away from the graveyard, he was still the son of Gu Qi and his wife because these two had struggled to live for another three years just for him. They abandoned Luo Jianqing in the Luo River, but they were also the people who saved him from drowning. Although there was a gap of forty-one-years separation between Luo Jianqing\u2019s parents and himself, Gu Qi and his wife still took care of Luo Jianqing for forty days.Luo Jianqing took out the money that was hidden under the bed when he came back to the house and gave the money away to every household in the village and his brother-in-law. He left while the man was still trying to figure out what was going on.When Luo Jianqing reached the exit of the village, a beautiful girl rushed towards him, couldn\u2019t care less about her reputation among the villagers.Holding a vivid red flower in her hand, the girl was crying. She wiped out the tears and gave the flower to Luo Jianqing who was looking every movement of her and smiled, \u201cAre you the sixteenth girl who was born in the Gu Village?\u201d\u201cI am the only one in the village ranked as the sixteenth girl.\u201dLuo Jianqing laughed with relief as if he knew something already.Pulling out a white jade hairpin from his Interspatial Ring, Luo Jianqing helped Gu Sixteen to wear this gorgeous accessory. The girl was so happy that her fingertips were shivering with delight, but Luo Jianqing said, \u201cI\u2019m not your true love. Somebody once told me that it is her own business to love me, and that business has nothing to do with me. So now I only want to tell you that I\u2019m not the one, but if you insist, I won\u2019t clear your memory.\u201dWidened her eyes, Gu Sixteen said, \u201cyou\u2026\u2026you are indeed an immortal!\u201d\u201cSixteen, you will understand that I\u2019m not the one when you met your true love.\u201dLeaving this sentence, Luo Jianqing used his spiritual power to leave the village and flew up to the sky.For a whole day, Gu Sixteen gazed at the direction where Luo Jianqing went. At last, she went home with tears hanging on her eyelashes. She didn\u2019t know that many years later she would hold her grandson in her arms and smile with content, saying \u201cactually, a long time ago, grandma liked someone once, but I fear that \u2018like\u2019 was only remained as \u2018like\u2019, not \u2018love\u2019, for if I did love that man, I would take pains to follow him no matter what it takes, not like what I did \u2013 stood there for only one day.\u201dIn fact, every cause had an effect. All was determined by fate. There was no coincidence but only causality.When Luo Jianqing came back to the Tai Hua Mountain, all the young disciples were stunned and looked at him with disbelief, and finally started to shout, \u201cit\u2019s Luo Jianqing! He comes back! You finally come back!\u201dThis good news was spread all over the Tai Hua Mountain in less than half an hour. Many elders and apprentices came to check if Luo Jianqing really came back. Luo Jianqing thanked their warm welcome and then flew to the Cang Shuang Peak to report to the Master.When Luo Jianqing flew away, an elder was shocked by what he sensed from this senior apprentice, \u201cwait\u2026\u2026is it true that Jianqing already reached to the Nascent Soul Period?\u201d\u201cIt is! It\u2019s the Nascent Soul Period!\u201d\u201cOMG, the senior disciple cultivated for only forty-one years. I can\u2019t believe somebody could make it.\u201d\u201cMaster Xuan Lingzi made it when he was fifty-six years old. Luo Jianqing is only forty-one. It\u2019s impossible!\u201dAt the moment Luo Jianqing came back to the Tai Hua Mountain, the cinnabar mole between his eyebrows turned into a golden beam and suddenly flew to the Yu Xiao Peak. Pretended he couldn\u2019t care less about that peak, Luo Jianqing said nothing but gazed at the light.He met the master when he arrived at the Cang Shuang Peak.Hao Xingzi asked what happened after he was swallowed by the ghost drift sands and how did he manage to come out while the gate of the Liu Yan Valley was closed. Luo Jianqing answered every question the master asked but hid the truth that Mo Qiu was a Fiend Cultivator.Hao Xingzi sighed, \u201cafter all, that was the grave of a Heaven Level Demon Exalt. It would be strange if everything there went on normal. Jianqing, you\u2019d better hurry up to the Yu Xiao Peak. While you were gone, your master had made the whole Four Sects and Eight Clans into chaos.\u201dLuo Jianqing was surprised to hear that, \u201cmaster, can you tell me exactly what is going on?\u201d\u201cWhen the Liu Yan Valley was opened, the gate didn\u2019t close for three days, but you remained missing. Seeing the gate closed again while you still didn\u2019t show up, Master Shan was worried about you. Then we heard some cultivators saying that you and another one from the Mo Family were swallowed by the ghost drift sands. Though we knew you were still alive \u2013 signed by your Life Lantern \u2013 your master still lost control and went ballistic. He hurt the people sent by the Duan Hun Sect, Fei Hua Sect, Bai Family, Yun Family, and Mo Family who came here to help explain what happened to you.\u201dHearing what was said by Hao Xingzi, Luo Jianqing said these words unconsciously, \u201cmaster, I have a question that I don\u2019t know if it is appropriate for me to ask: is it true that my master\u2026\u2026is sick?\u201dSilence fulfilled the palace for a long time. Hao Xingzi sighed, \u201cthe first disciple of the Tai Hua Mountain, Luo Jianqing, do you have a slight idea how much did your master has done for you?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOne hour later, Luo Jianqing got out of the Ling Yun Hall. He was in a hurry. Before flew up to the sky, he heard a gentle voice sounded behind him, \u201csenior disciple Luo, you do come back.\u201dLuo Jianqing stopped to turn back.He saw Zuo Yunmo who was wearing a light-colored robe with Qing Yun Sword hanging on the waist. Smiling as the summer breeze, Zuo Yunmo looked exactly the same with dozens of years ago. However, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t have much time to hang around, so he said, \u201csenior disciple\u00a0 Zuo, it\u2019s been a long time. I\u2019m quite busy right now, so, next time.\u201dBut Zuo Yunmo said, \u201cWhat are you going to do?\u201dLuo Jianqing wasn\u2019t expecting the question, but soon he showed a smile to Zuo Yunmo, \u201cI\u2019ve been gone for four years. My Master is surely eager to see me. I must meet him soon and\u2026\u2026I have something to tell him.\u201dAn amiable smile was what responding Luo Jianqing.Looking at Zuo Yunmo\u2019s eyes, Luo Jianqing felt like his senior had seen through him. Luo Jianqing remembered in the last life he met Zuo Yunmo at the arctic for the last time; he remembered, at that time, Zuo Yunmo was looking at him with the same gaze, so profound and so deep.But something was different. Zuo Yunmo wasn\u2019t smiling when they met at the arctic, while now, he was still smiling.After a while, Zuo Yunmo said, \u201cJianqing, several days ago I heard a pair of master and apprentice was kicked out of a sect in Liangzhou. Do you know the reason?\u201dLuo Jianqing was shocked a little, and asked, \u201cwhy?\u201dZuo Yunmo gazed at the beautiful young man standing before him. He sighed with sorrow glimmered in his eyes, but the emotion disappeared very quickly. At last, he said in calmness, \u201cbecause that pair of master and apprentice fell into a relationship that never should exist between them.\u201dSaid nothing, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t have any expression on his face.Zuo Yunmo kept saying, \u201cJianqing, I haven\u2019t met you for a long time. I\u2019m impressed that you\u2019ve reached the Nascent Soul Period.\u201d\u201cYou reached the median stage of the Gold Core Period as well.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a rare opportunity that we meet each other today. How about we make full use of it and exchange a few moves to see\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cSenior disciple Zuo, I have to go back to the Yu Xiao Peak.\u201dSeemed worried a little bit, Zuo Yunmo frowned. He didn\u2019t even follow the formalities, blurting out, \u201cJianqing, I\u2019m your senior who watched you grow up. I know you, anyhow, you can\u2019t\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cBrother Yunmo!\u201dZuo Yunmo couldn\u2019t utter a word.He saw Luo Jianqing looking at himself with a fearless smile on his gorgeous face.Luo Jianqing gazed at his brother, said in a firm voice, \u201cYunmo, I haven\u2019t called you in this name since I was five years old. I will remember what you said, but I have to go right now. One day, when the right time comes, we can exchange a few movestogether.\u201dThen Luo Jianqing transformed into a bice light and disappeared in a sudden.Realized what happened, Zuo Yunmo wobbled a little. Looking up and gazing at the direction where Luo Jianqing went, he shut his lips tight. After a long time, Zuo Yunmo sighed, slowly closed his eyes and relaxed his hand which was gripping the Qing Yun Sword.At the same time, Luo Jianqing arrived at the Yu Xiao Peak.Hundreds of Banning Boundary vanished before Luo Jianqing. He made it to the peak as easily as walking on firm earth. When he came to the top of the mountain, he saw that man who was wearing a golden-rimmed white robe. The man was standing in the Garden of Spiritual Herbs and looking at the herbs.Luo Jianqing had thousands of words to tell him before they actually met, but when Luo Jianqing finally saw him, he couldn\u2019t say a single word.He still remembered what Sir Hao Xingzi told him in the Ling Yun Hall.\u201cDo you know why Xuan Lingzi hasn\u2019t played the Yu Xiao Zither for more than a hundred year? Because, although others can get benefit from the music and enhance their cultivation, his own cultivation will be worn down when he plays that instrument. He knows this, Jianqing, but he still played it for you.\u201cDo you know what makes humans and demons remained in peace for a hundred years? All of the cultivators who have reached beyond the Da Sheng Period know this: the most powerful Heaven Level Demon Exalt has reached the level which equals to the late stage of the Da Sheng Period \u2013 even more powerful than the Fiend Exalt Mo Qianqiu! Your Master Xuan Lingzi can defeat it, but he can\u2019t kill it, not to mention the amount of Demon Exalt is twofold of our human Masters!\u201cAll of this is because that, after the war, Xuan Lingzi and the Demon Exalt had a contract which confined Xuan Lingzi at the Tai Hua Mountain, reducing his chance to encounter divine opportunities. On the other hand, stipulating Mo Qianqiu\u2019s Fiend Palace as the border, the four most powerful Demon Exalts have to stay in the demon realm and can never step on the thirty-six continents.\u201cXuan Lingzi isn\u2019t supposed to step out of the Tai Hua Mountain, but forty-one years ago, he split half of his Primordial Life out of his body and took you back from the Luo River. Five years ago, he did it again, followed you to Sir Bei Dou\u2019s tomb and came back with impaired body! Four years ago, he split his Primordial Life for the third time and went to the Liu Yan Valley with you.\u201cLiu Yan Valley is a dangerous place. In the passing years, when the gate was closed, nobody could get out of there. Do you know how severe it would be if half of his Primordial Life was destroyed inside the valley?\u201cJianqing, your Master had put in lots of efforts in you. You have to take pains to cultivate. Supreme Spiritual Bone won\u2019t be born into this world again in the next thousand years. If you could reach the Deity Transformation Period within three hundred years like your Master, then our humans\u2026\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing couldn\u2019t catch what Sir Hao Mingzi said next.His heart was pounding. All of his Spiritual Power was rushing inside his body with tremendous force. He could see no more, hear no more, what remained in his mind was just \u201che still played it for you\u201d, \u201che split his Primordial Life for you\u201d \u2026\u2026Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t imagine how painful it is to split the Primordial Life. He never tried that before, but he surely knew how sensitive the Primordial Life could be.When he reached the Nascent Soul Period at the ninth layer of the Liu Yan Valley, he felt enormous pain when building the Nascent Soul using the spiritual power. He remembered that he couldn\u2019t even control his shivering body. Then how suffering it could be\u2026\u2026to split the Primordial Life?That man followed him to the grave and the Liu Yan Valley\u2026\u2026That man prolonged his parents\u2019 lives for him\u2026\u2026That man stepped out of the Tai Hua Mountain for him no matter how dangerous it was\u2026\u2026\u2018Wu Yin, if you really did all of these, then, who am I to you!\u2019Watching his Master in silence, Luo Jianqing stood at the top of the Yu Xiao Peak. He didn\u2019t say a word, just stood there and looked at him.After a while, Xuan Lingzi turned his body to face him. Frowned a little, Xuan Lingzi said, \u201cWhat happened to you in the Liu Yan Valley? Why do you come back this late? It\u2019s nice that you\u2019ve reached the Nascent Soul Period, but it\u2019s still too early for you. Your foundation is not quite firm. Remember to keep cultivating and practicing. Don\u2019t drown into your accomplishment.\u201dLuo Jianqing still kept his mouth shut and didn\u2019t respond.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayXuan Lingzi was surprised by his reaction, \u201cJianqing, I am speaking to you. Why don\u2019t you respond?\u201dLuo Jianqing stared him with a profound gaze, still not uttering a word.Irritated a little bit, Xuan Lingzi said, \u201cDoes these several years staying outside make you forget your manners? Since when have you started to became this rude? You\u2019ve just come back, and because of this, I am not going to sentence you to the Penalty Gate. In the following days, however, if you are still behaving like this\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster.\u201dHeard Luo Jianqing\u2019s husky voice, Xuan Lingzi stopped speaking. He looked at his gorgeous disciple who was wearing a bice robe, surrounded by a verdant bamboo forest. The wind was dancing with Luo Jianqing\u2019s hair. Smiling, the disciple finally spoke, \u201cI got out of the Liu Yan Valley one year ago and floated along the Luo River. An old couple saved me,\u201d stopped for a while, Luo Jianqing said, \u201cthey were my parents.\u201dXuan Lingzi didn\u2019t say anything at first, then, \u201cyou didn\u2019t break the bond, however.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded, \u201cno, I didn\u2019t. Master, why do I have to break the bond linking my parents and I? Why do I have to be a person with no emotions, no heart? You told me that even you didn\u2019t break all the mortal bonds. No offense, but your parents passed away a long time ago. Is that the bond you kept untouched? In other words, with all my respect, may I ask you what indeed is the bond which still linking you to the mortal word?!\u201dXuan Lingzi flicked his long sleeve, \u201chow dare you!\u201dLuo Jianqing was knocked into the air. Fought with the pain, he slowly walked toward Xuan Lingzi, \u201cmaster, is your unbroken bond linking to your parents?\u201d\u201cI have no father or mother. That bond was not even formed.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026Sir Hao Xingzi? Your fellow brothers? The entire Tai Hua Mountain?\u201d\u201cThese are not the mortal bonds!\u201dAt this moment, Luo Jianqing had made his way to Xuan Lingzi. He slightly lifted his gaze, staring at his Master who stood before him nonchalantly. He looked at Xuan Lingzi\u2019s visage with all the care in this world but didn\u2019t notice his master\u2019s already clenched fist hidden under the sleeve. Luo Jianqing suddenly burst out a laugh, then managed to say these in seriousness:\u201cThen, Master, is your mortal bond linking to\u2026\u2026me?\u201dWidened his eyes, Xuan Lingzi formed a golden sword-light in his palm. Luo Jianqing was knocked into the air and bumped on an old bamboo.Xuan Lingzi was incandescent, \u201cbehave yourself! Luo Jianqing, you showed no respect to your master and said very offensive words! Go to the Penalty Cliff and think over your mistakes! I won\u2019t let you come back until you truly know what you have done. Your dozens of years of cultivation has come to naught. You don\u2019t deserve the title of Senior Brother in our sect, and you don\u2019t deserve to be my disciple!\u201dSeized with a severe pain in the chest, Luo Jianqing groaned and spat out blood.Saw his apprentice got hurt, Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t show the slightest care, instead, he looked at Luo Jianqing dauntingly.However, Luo Jianqing smiled. He wiped out the blood around his mouth and stood up. Step by step, he walked toward Xuan Lingzi again. He stared at Xuan Lingzi with honesty and determination ignited in his gaze, just like flames, as if Xuan Lingzi was burning inside. Didn\u2019t move at all, Xuan Lingzi was stunned, while heard a laugh came out of his disciple\u2019s mouth:\u201cMaster, is that\u2026\u2026what you really want?\u201cAmong all the masters in the world, which one of them would split his Primordial Life several times just because he was worried about his apprentice?\u201cWhich one of them would put tremendous efforts to help his disciple but keep it in secret?\u201dFace paled, Xuan Lingzi listened to Luo Jianqing\u2019s interrogation but couldn\u2019t refute a word at all.When Luo Jianqing finally made his way to Xuan Lingzi, he stared at his Master with a complicated gaze. He heard the rustling sound from the forest. He heard the wind whispering. Luo Jianqing said subtly, \u201cif you truly did all of these in the name of the care from a master, then, can you tell me who was the one in Dubhe, the seventh layer of Sir Bei Dou\u2019s grave leaning on top of me and couldn\u2019t help \u2026\u2026kissing me?\u201dXuan Lingzi was shocked as if he was stroke by lightning.He was surprised that Luo Jianqing still remembered that kiss. He paid efforts to carefully remove that part of memory from Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind, but, obviously, he failed to make his disciple put it into complete oblivion.All these years, Luo Jianqing thought it was only a dream, a fantasy created by his desire.All he remembered was only a kiss. The one he had loved for dozens of years was leaning upon him and kissing him like it was the end of the world.How is it even possible for his Master to kiss him like that?However, Hao Xingzi told him that Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Primordial Life followed him to the grave and came back with severe injury.Why this man was injured?What Hao Xingzi told him gave an explanation for Li Xiuchen\u2019s wounds and Sir Bei Dou\u2019s remnant soul\u2019s obedience.All of these was because his Master came and rescued him. His master\u2026\u2026kissed him.How can these be simply explained as \u2018master-disciple relationship\u2019?Looking at his eminent Master standing before him but showing only indifference, Luo Jianqing could no longer keep his fake smile. Feared to hear a disappointing answer, his voice was trembling.\u201cWu Yin, who am I\u2026\u2026to you?\u201dA kiss.With all the love and passion Luo Jianqing kissed Xuan Lingzi. It happened in a sudden. The Master didn\u2019t have time to elude. He was stunned, and just like that, he let his apprentice kiss him. Luo Jianqing felt a scorching heat transmitted from their lips. He stretched out his arms and embraced his Master \u2013 like what he\u2019s been imagining for dozens of years.Put all the rules, boundaries, and limitations into disdain, Luo Jianqing kissed Xuan Lingzi, licking and biting his Master\u2019s still-ice-cold lips. Then, suddenly, he felt pain dispersing from his chest \u2013 he was knocked into the air.Xuan Lingzi was standing before his bamboo house, shivering, and said hoarsely, \u201cHow dare you, Luo Jianqing! Do you really believe that I won\u2019t kill you?!\u201d\u201cWu Yin, you like me.\u201d Luo Jianqing was lying on the ground. Blood was dripping out of his mouth, but he still said it in delight.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s expressionless mask was broken. Now his face was pale, his voice unstable, \u201cNon\u2026\u2026nonsense!\u201d\u201cBut, Wu Yin, you like me.\u201dLuo Jianqing stood up as if he wasn\u2019t hurt at all. He walked toward Xuan Lingzi and kissed his Master again. Luo Jianqing got the answer he wanted from Xuan Lingzi\u2019s stunned but accepting posture, but that posture only remained for a very short time. A golden-sword light stabbed into Luo Jianqing\u2019s shoulder, while his Master turned into a golden light and disappeared in the forest. Smiling, Luo Jianqing gazed at the direction his Master had gone.After making sure that Xuan Lingzi had truly left, however, Luo Jianqing spat lots of blood with bice spiritual light mixed inside. Lying in a pool of his own blood, Luo Jianqing fainted out.Still mad about his disciple\u2019s behavior, Xuan Lingzi came back one day later, and saw Luo Jianqing who was covered by blood at his last gasp.Startled, Xuan Lingzi rushed to Luo Jianqing\u2019s side. Hands shivering, he held up his disciple and tried to check him out using his golden Spiritual Power. Luo Jianqing was losing his breath, and his Spiritual Power was even too weak to capture. When Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Spiritual Power reached to Luo Jianqing\u2019s Dan Tian, he ceased his every movement.There were only regrets and fear kindled in his eyes.\u201cYour primordial life is weak and unstable. Forcing it to fight against my sword light? Have you lost your mind?!\u201dWithout any hesitancy, Xuan Lingzi held Luo Jianqing in his arms and turned into a golden light, heading toward Qing Lan Peak.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Yu Qingzi was alchemizing pills. She was surprised to see her younger fellow disciple, and even more surprised to see wounded Luo Jianqing, \u201chow did he get injured so badly and even his fragile Primordial Life get hurt? Brother, what the heck is\u2026\u2026! Freaking hell! It\u2019s your sword light!\u201dDumbstruck, Yu Qingzi\u2019s eyes travelled back and forth that pair of Master and apprentice.Xuan Lingzi was sweating badly with a pale face white like paper, as if he was gonna faint out. He said in a hoarse voice, \u201csister, save him! Save him!\u201dTen days later, Luo Jianqing woke up in Qing Lan Peak.Mu Tianxin was taking care of him. She was exultant to see Luo Jianqing finally wakes up. \u201cThere you go, Senior Brother! My Master told me that this time you are in great danger because your Primordial Life was so badly wounded before it was stable. If not taking this carefully, you will face thirty percent of chance dropping back to the Golden Core Period, twenty percent of chance of never going to have a Nascent Soul in your lifetime, and ten percent of chance\u2026\u2026\u201d Mu Tianxin clenched her fist, \u201chow dare Master said that you may die because of these wounds! Nonsense! I won\u2019t speak to her for half a year!\u201dLuo Jianqing was just able to open his eyes but still couldn\u2019t speak. What he could do was looking at Mu Tianxin with anxiety.However, Mu Tianxin couldn\u2019t get the meaning out of his eyes. She just kept talking.Three days later, Luo Jianqing finally got back his strength to get out of the bed. What he did first was saying goodbye to Sir Yu Qingzi, preparing to go back to Yu Xiao Peak. Yu Qingzi sighed, \u201cJianqing, your Master has gone into seclusion. What have you done making your Master this mad?\u201dLuo Jianqing was stunned, after a while, he said, \u201cRespected Master, I fear that it was my these-years\u2019 staying outside made him worried about me.\u201dYu Qingzi nodded. \u201cMakes sense. Your Master cares about you so much. Do not let him worry again. I remember when you were little, Tianxin and you hang out to the Beast Garden on the Yu Shou Peak and didn\u2019t come back for a whole day. Your Master was so fretful that he almost turned the whole Tai Hua Mountain upside down.\u201d\u201cRespected Master\u2026\u2026what I remembered was only that three-month punishment at the Penalty Cliff.\u201dYu Qingzi laughed, \u201cno, clearly you misremembered it. It wasn\u2019t three months. Your Master let you come back after only one-month of punishment. Why? Because you are his precious disciple. He made the whole Tai Hua Mountain into chaos just for two disciples. That was no glory. If I were him, I won\u2019t tell you either.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded in silence.Yu Qingzi didn\u2019t notice anything unusual. She exhorted Luo Jianqing to be a good apprentice and dismissed him.Walking at a lane on Qing Lan Peak, Luo Jianqing was thinking over Sir Yu Qingzi\u2019s words.\u201cThey are saying that I am spoiling Tianxin. Oh no, that was nothing compared to Brother Xuan Lingzi.\u201dThere was a saying that you can never know the truth if you are involved in the event. Luo Jianqing remembered that although his Master intentionally hid his emotions, every time he came back to the Yu Xiao Peak, Xun Lingzi was always waiting for him at the top of the Yu Xiao Peak and would never go into seclusion while he\u2019s around.Countless thoughts were hovering over Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind, rendering\u00a0 him knit his eyebrows. He started to regret pushing his Master so hard to face their relationship.He knew, from the very beginning, that his Master held manners and rules in importance. Sir Xuan Lingzi of the Tai Hua Mountain was eminent, respected by all the cultivators over the world, but was so fragile and incandescent that day just because of him.Luo Jianqing did vent his spleen at that moment. He even thought about what would happen if his Master saw his corpse. Would he regret? Would he remorse? Would he be despaired seeing what he has done? Luo Jianqing wanted to break his Master\u2019s mask of indifference, so he tried his best to hide his wounds, not letting Xuan Lingzi discovers it.He didn\u2019t know, however, at that time, Xuan Lingzi was already too disturbed to notice his injury.Luo Jianqing got what he wanted from Sir Yu Qingzi\u2019s words. She told him that when his Master took him to Qing Lan Peak, Xuan Lingzi was shuddering as if he would collapse immediately. Xuan Lingzi lost his calmness, begging Sir Yu Qingzi to save his apprentice\u2019s life and even wanted to cure Luo Jianqing using his own Primordial Life.Sir Yu Qingzi told him, \u201cI never saw my younger disciple so frightened like that for the past three hundred years.\u201dHowever, his Master left immediately and even went into seclusion after making sure he would be okay.Now, Luo Jianqing came back to the Yu Xiao Peak. He stood before his Master\u2019s house, didn\u2019t utter a word.After a long time, he said huskily, \u201cMaster\u201d.There was only silence.Tried to open the door, Luo Jianqing reached out his hands but was blocked out by a golden ward. \u201cMaster, given that you\u2019ve already done so much for me, why are you still hiding in the house refusing to meet?\u201dAgain, silence.Luo Jianqing insisted, \u201cif you don\u2019t come out, I will kneel before your house until you do\u201d.He knelt down, back straight, staring at the door wistfully.Be it a sun scorching day or raindrops striking day, he was kneeling.For a Nascent Soul Period cultivator, it wouldn\u2019t be a problem kneeling here even for ten years. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t move for a whole month, but the door still didn\u2019t have a slightest sign to open. Still recovering from his previous injuries, Luo Jianqing fainted out on the fortieth day.When he woke up, that door was still shutting tight, nonchalantly refusing him.Suddenly, Luo Jianqing smiled. Wobbling, he got up from the ground. \u201cAlthough you don\u2019t want to see me now, I will wait for you till the end of the world. Wu Yin, I will start seclusion. Can you still treat me like this after I step into the Deity Transformation Period?\u201dSilence was what responded to him.Luo Jianqing stared at the door as if he could see Xuan Lingzi through the ward. He remained unmoved for a long time, but unwaveringly walked away at last.\u201cI, Luo Jianqing, not only want to be your apprentice, but also\u2026\u2026your lover.\u201dThen Luo Jianqing went back to his house and went into seclusion.His words were echoing in the Yu Xiao Peak, driving the leaves of bamboo into rustling dance.In a bamboo house, Xuan Lingzi shut his eyelids tight, face pale, as if he was trying to smother his turbulent heart. In another house, Luo Jianqing started cultivating. Only he knew that his Nascent Soul formed at the age of forty \u2013 sixteen-years faster than Xuan Lingzi.\u2018When will he reach the Deity Transformation Period?\u2019\u2018What will happen when he finally makes it?\u2019He told Xuan Lingzi his feelings about him, but his Master was still defending the boundary between Master and disciple, didn\u2019t want to overstep. There was only one way \u2013 forcing Xuan Lingzi to face him with undeniable power!Right before Luo Jianqing was ready to empower his Primordial Life, he saw a thick book dropping from nowhere and landed on the floor. Surprised, he stretched his fingers and used his spiritual power to get the book in his palm.Seeking Immortality\u00a0II!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Jianqing never thought that he would see this book again, and it was the second volume of it.The first volume of Seeking Immortality was destroyed by himself intentionally after he made sure that he memorized every word of it. The world would be driven into chaos if someone else read that book. He couldn\u2019t afford to take any risk to preserve it.Luo Jianqing was sure that he didn\u2019t see any serial number on the cover of that book, but the first volume did end with Li Xiuchen got out of the Liu Yan Valley and replaced Luo Jianqing\u2019s status among all the disciples in Tai Hua Mountain.After Luo Jianqing\u2019s reincarnation, however, everything was different.Li Xiuchen didn\u2019t have a single chance to show off. In the book \u2013 or their last life \u2013 Li Xiuchen was the second disciple of Yu Xiao Peak, but now he was just one of the mediocrities on the Hao Ming Peak. Frowned, Luo Jianqing opened Seeking Immortality and kept on reading.He finished it within fifteen minutes.Cultivators had brilliant memorization ability which was far more powerful than the mortals, not to mention that Luo Jianqing himself was the best one among all the Nascent Soul cultivators. He destroyed the book after he finished it. The book was the sequel of the first volume of Seeking Immortality, which wrote about how Li Xiuchen surprised Xuan Lingzi with more than a hundred Yan Fruits that he got from the Liu Yan Valley.More than a hundred Yan Fruits!Even Xuan Lingzi couldn\u2019t find this much of Yan Fruit in Liu Yan Valley.It was true that Xuan Lingzi could deal with all the challenges in the Liu Yan Valley like a piece of cake, but since Yan Fruit couldn\u2019t resonate with Spiritual Power, cultivators can\u2019t use their Spiritual Sense to search it. It was just a normal fruit like anyone else before it was consumed by cultivators. This was strong evidence on how lucky Li Xiuchen was. In the last life, Li Xiuchen became a well-known name on Tai Hua Mountain after he came back from Liu Yan Valley with a gigantic amount of Yan Fruit.Luo Jianqing remembered this, but he found something interesting in Seeking Immortality \uf049\uf049. For instance, the book emphasized that Luo Jianqing got out of the Liu Yan Valley on the last day and immediately showed others all the twentyish Yan Fruits he had found.Others were impressed. Some of them even kept saying that \u201ccultivator Luo must be the top 1 among all the people who went to the Liu Yan Valley this time\u201d.However, right before the gate was about to close, Li Xiuchen came out with more than a hundred Yan Fruit which drew everyone\u2019s attention.The book wrote:\u201cSeeing this, that handsome Great Senior Disciple immediately got mad and felt embarrassed. He left in anger but no one ever noticed his disappearance. The compliments for him were still echoing, but sadly they all turned into a slap on his face.\u201dSpeechless, Luo Jianqing touched his face.It was true that he was irritated when it happened, but he was no petty person. He admitted that he did leave with fury, not for Yan Fruits, but for something Li Xiuchen said:\u201cThank god that my Master gave me some defensive instruments, otherwise I definitely can\u2019t make it.\u201dWhy on earth did Xuan Lingzi give Li Xiuchen instruments but only told Luo Jianqing \u201cdo not dishonor our Yu Xiao Peak\u201d instead?!Thought about these, Luo Jianqing became fidget, then he recalled Xuan Lingzi\u2019s face when his Master was forced to face their abnormal relationship. Luo Jianqing found it quite funny in an agonized way. He didn\u2019t understand why Xuan Lingzi treated him like that in their last life. At least he didn\u2019t send half of his Primordial Life to escort Luo Jianqing to the Liu Yan Valley in the last life.Perhaps it was something he had done in this life making Xuan Lingzi fell in love with him?Nobody was there to answer his question.Refused to see him, his Master was hiding in his house like a turtle and went into seclusion. Luo Jianqing failed figuring out a way to get him out of the room. He tried kneeling before the door for forty days. The result wasn\u2019t that well.Luo Jianqing looked at the ashes lying on the ground \u2013 the remnants of Seeking Immortality \uf049\uf049 \u2013 and chuckled. He yelled at the air, \u201cMaster, one year later, the septennial competition between different sects on Tai Hua Mountain will begin. This time, will you come out and remind me \u2018do not dishonor our Yu Xiao Peak\u2019?\u201dLuo Jianqing used his Spiritual Power when speaking these words. Wu Yin could definitely hear this as long as he didn\u2019t conceal all of his senses.However, what responded Luo Jianqing was a long silence.Didn\u2019t get wrath at all, Luo Jianqing shouted again. \u201cMaster, how would you punish me if I lose in the competition?\u201dStill, nobody answered him.Luo Jianqing said calmly, \u201cwell, if you don\u2019t reply, then I guess I shall lose.\u201d\u2018Swish\u2014\u2014\u2019A golden-sword light suddenly passed through the flaw on the door and cut a wisp of his hair as if it was a warning. However, Luo Jianqing widened his eyes which were rippling with surprise, opened his mouth and was about to say something, but felt an overwhelming Coercion pressing on his shoulders which constrained him on his bed.The Coercion from a Deity Transformation Period cultivator made Luo Jianqing panting badly. Sweat was dripping from his forehead. He tried to get up but was defeated by the Coercion upon his body which acted as a stone weighing about thousands of kilograms. He tried to speak but couldn\u2019t let out a single syllable.Luo Jianqing refused to surrender, so the Coercion kept forcing on.After a whole day, the Coercion suddenly dismissed just as quick as its appearance.Finally relaxed his tense body, Luo Jianqing was lying on the bed, couldn\u2019t move a finger. He was fighting the Coercion all the time, but the enormous gap between their powers made him unable to revolt.Nonetheless\u2026\u2026\u201cThis is the first time I disobey you in the past forty-one years\u2026\u2026am I right, Wu Yin?\u201dLike a stone falling into the magnificent ocean \u2013 Luo Jianqing\u2019s words got no response.Luo Jianqing lay on the bed and chuckled. He covered his eyes with palms but couldn\u2019t conceal the laugh.His Master liked him. His Master really liked him. His Master really really liked him\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Jianqing stopped provoking Xuan Lingzi.Went over the plots from\u00a0Seeking Immortality, he sat down and started cultivating.The Spiritual Power was like a spring, running over the withered vines all over his body, but stopped when it reached to his shoulder. That day, Xuan Lingzi stabbed Luo Jianqing\u2019s shoulder, the magnificent golden-sword light made the vines at Luo Jianqing\u2019s shoulder badly impaired. Even Yu Qingzi couldn\u2019t help him mend these. The only way to heal was fixing it with Luo Jianqing\u2019s own Spiritual Power.For a consecutive ten days, Luo Jianqing shut his eyes tight, using the Spiritual Power to flood over the clogged vines.The vines in Luo Jianqing\u2019s body were like magnificent rivers and were twice the size of the common cultivators. They were strong enough to bear violent crushes of Spiritual Power. However, when these vines were damaged, they were surely more difficult to mend than that of the commoners.Failed several times, Luo Jianqing took out a Re-jading Pill and swallowed it. Suddenly, a gigantic amount of Spiritual Power flooded out from his body. Although it was mammoth, the Spiritual Power was quite tamed, didn\u2019t move a little without Luo Jianqing\u2019s instruction.Over the Tai Hua Mountain, there were less than three people who were able to make this Seven Grade Earth Level Re-jading Pill!This piece of pill was given by Yu Qingzi for curing Luo Jianqing\u2019s wounds. The materials for making Re-jading Pill was extraordinarily rare. Even Sir Yu Qingzi was lacking two kinds of materials. Someone told Luo Jianqing that Xuan Lingzi managed to find the last two herbs for him. One from Xuan Lingzi\u2019s own collection. As for the other, he got it after begging Sir Hao Xingzi for a whole day.After all, Luo Jianqing was just a Nascent Soul Period cultivator. He can\u2019t use all the Spiritual Power and the Healing Strength from the Re-jading Pill. There was only a small amount of the pill orbiting inside him while the rest of it all turned into Spiritual Power.Luo Jianqing tried to unblock his vines.When the Spiritual Power crashed into the vines that were blocked by the blood, Luo Jianqing moaned with his face slowly turning pale.Like a knife cutting his body, the Spiritual Power was acting like a blade, cutting all the atrophied vines and cleaning the blood inside it. How strong the vines once were, how painful it was to cut it now. Even his lips turned pale. Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t suppress groaning painfully.Every cut made Luo Jianqing shiver. Of course, he had no idea that his Master was also sitting on the bed in the house next to his, face pale, fist clenched.At first, Luo Jianqing could still bear the pain, but when the Spiritual Power reached his shoulder, Luo Jianqing trembled and finally passed out.In another bamboo house, Xuan Lingzi suddenly stood up and walked toward the door before he even realized what he was doing. Then he ceased his steps, faltering and looking at the ground. After a whole hour, he finally flicked his sleeves and got back on his bed.One day later, Luo Jianqing woke up. The Re-Jading Pill was already dimmed.Pupil shrank, Luo Jianqing quickly operated his Spiritual Power to cut the blood which blocked his vines.\u201cAh!\u201dSuffering from enormous pain, Luo Jianqing let out a groan. Heard this, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s fingertips started trembling.Luo Jianqing knew that he couldn\u2019t afford to waste a single second, he couldn\u2019t faint again. The Re-jading Pill got dimmer and dimmer by time. He would have to take another pill if he couldn\u2019t successfully mend his vines with this one.But, for now, there was nowhere to find another Seven Grade Earth Level Re-jading Pill.Surely, Yu Qingzi can probably make another, but where to collect all the rare materials?Anxiety emerged on his comely face. Luo Jianqing\u2019s clothes were already wetted by his own sweat. He contemplated for a while then took out a white-jade bottle from his Interspatial Ring. Without any hesitation, he picked a black pill from the bottle and swallowed it.Shocked, Xuan Lingzi immediately opened his eyes, \u201cJianqing!\u201dOf course, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s words didn\u2019t reach Luo Jianqing who was suffering from the pain sprawling inside his body. The moment that black pill melted inside Luo Jianqing\u2019s mouth, he felt pain a hundred times stronger than before, as if he was put on a grill after all of his flesh got sliced off.This Six Grade Heaven Level Sober Pill was the second thing Yu Qingzi gave him when he left Qing Lan Peak.A normal Sober Pill could do nothing more than rendering one to be awake for ten days and ten nights.A Heaven Level one, however, if taken, the person\u2019s spirit will still be sober even if he was chopped in pieces. He will bear that soaring pain for ten days till death.For Luo Jianqing, he had no intention to commit suicide but to keep himself awake.The Sober Pill will strengthen his senses \u2013 no matter pain or what \u2013 a hundred times more. Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t think that much. All he wanted was to be sober, and that was enough.With no hesitation, Luo Jianqing unsheathed his Spiritual Blade and took a strike toward his veins. He clenched his teeth, brandishing his Spiritual Power to remove all the clots. Blood belched from throat, Luo Jianqing figured that death will be a much easier task compared to this. Nevertheless, three days later, he completed cleaning the veins.Then, what was waiting for him was sewing veins using Spiritual Power.Actually, Yu Qingzi could do the surgery herself, but there was ten percent of chance leaving scars on Luo Jianqing\u2019s veins which will lower his strength. Sir Yu Qingzi gave Luo Jianqing two choices: suffering, or weakening.It was obvious which one Luo Jianqing chose.Sewing the veins was distressing as well, but Luo Jianqing was already accustomed to it.When the last piece of vein was healed, he shivered, scarlet liquid slithered among his lips.Luo Jianqing passed out, what he didn\u2019t know was, in another bamboo house, Xuan Lingzi finally relaxed his fists which palmed all the bruises and bleeding wounds.Three days later, Luo Jianqing came to his senses eventually.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChecked his body with Spiritual Sense, Luo Jianqing found that he was covered completely and even more powerful than before because of the Re-jading Pill. He nodded in satisfaction and started to build his Primordial Life.The baby Nascent Soul was just formed and was still sleeping with eyes shut tight.When Luo Jianqing reached the Nascent Soul Period, he put all his efforts on figuring out how to get out of the Liu Yan Valley, didn\u2019t have the time to assure his cultivation. After he arrived at the Gu Village, he was tested by his mortal bond, failed to find peace to cultivate. Then he came back to Tai Hua Mountain and had been disputing with Xuan Lingzi.All in all, Luo Jianqing\u2019s cultivation period was not stable, and just like what was said by Yu Qingzi \u2013 he might drop back to the Gold Core Period.He knew that he couldn\u2019t wait no more. Operating his Spiritual Power and transforming it into countless strings, Luo Jianqing instructed his Spiritual Power to seize all the spiritual resources from the nature.The natural\u2019s Spiritual Power was avoiding Luo Jianqing as if he was plague or what, didn\u2019t want to stay close to him at all, but Luo Jianqing\u2019s strings were like bullies, seizing the Spiritual Powers and stuff them into Luo Jianqing\u2019s body, leaving no room for them to say no. Luo Jianqing\u2019s string army was taking all the Spiritual Power on sight. \u2018No? You don\u2019t want to serve me? Well, you have no choice!\u2019When the strings elongated and reached Xuan Lingzi\u2019s house, they suddenly stopped moving.If Luo Jianqing opened his eyes, he could see that his \u201cbully\u201d strings nodded towards Xuan Lingzi\u2019s house respectfully, as if they were greeting someone, and then rushed towards other Spiritual Powers in such a speed as if they were escaping from something scary.Luo Jianqing showed off his power intentionally when he started to cultivate based on Nine Heavenly Seizure Record. Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t give him any reaction as if he didn\u2019t notice the anomaly. Luo Jianqing tried several times after this until he was fully assured that even Xuan Lingzi couldn\u2019t sense the power of the Seizure Record, and then started to use the power with no worries.Nine Heavenly Seizure Record was seizing all the Spiritual Powers in the Yu Xiao Peak and forced them into Luo Jianqing\u2019s body. They were coming in a soaring amount and, at last, cumulated into a whirlwind.Tai Hua Mountain itself was located at the heart of the Xuan Tian Continent, having the best spiritual mountain range in the world. Among the seven peaks, Yu Xiao Peak was standing at the center. Being the envy of all, this pair of Master and disciple owned the place of most abundant Spiritual Power.Now, a hail of Spiritual Power was rushing towards Luo Jianqing, making their way to his veins.Sensed what his disciple was up to, Xuan Lingzi stood up and flicked his sleeves to build a ward. In a blink, what was happening on Yu Xiao Peak was concealed, and even Sir Hao Xingzi wouldn\u2019t know it.About what his Master had done for him, Luo Jianqing, as usual, knew little about it.As soon as the Spiritual Power reached his veins, it belonged to him and listened to his command. Luo Jianqing operated a complete macrocosmic orbit and fed his Nascent Soul with the Spiritual Power, aiming to strengthen his weak Primordial Life.Cute and comely, his Nascent Soul looked like a baby Luo Jianqing.Looking pale and feeble, the spiritual infant was in a deep sleep, lying in a bice sphere Spiritual Ward. When more and more Spiritual Power patted him gently and immersed into his body, the baby\u2019s cheek turned cherry and radiant.Staring at this little Nascent Soul, Luo Jianqing held his breath.After the last wisp of Spiritual Power was fed to the baby Primordial Life, Luo Jianqing was about to grab more from the nature, but suddenly the tiny Nascent Soul slowly opened his eyes! Rubbed his eyes with chubby hands, the infant Nascent Soul stood up.Felt his heart pounding, Luo Jianqing saw a beam of bice light glimmering on the baby\u2019s forehead.Luo Jianqing forgot to blink his eyes, he stared at the infant Nascent Soul and saw a four pedaled lotus emerged at his glabellum!\u201cSo, all of us who cultivated based on\u00a0True Nine-Pedaled Lotus Record\u00a0will have the lotus sword pattern? Wait, no, I am not practicing that Record anymore but the\u00a0Nine Heavenly Seizure Record. Then was it because of the old one or the new one? Does Master\u2019s Nascent Soul have the same sword pattern as well?\u201dThese questions were hovering over Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind for a long time but our genius just couldn\u2019t figure them out. Surely he couldn\u2019t ask Xuan Lingzi directly. Regardless whether or not his Master will answer his question, this was too risky to ask. If the pattern wasn\u2019t a result of\u00a0True Nine \u2013Pedaled Lotus Record, asking the question was equal to confess that he had been practicing another Record.\u201cWell then, I guess I\u2019d better not let the Primordial Life left my flesh even if I reached the Out-of-Body Period. Unless\u2026\u2026one day I check Master\u2019s Primordial Life. If he has the sword pattern as well, there won\u2019t be any problem.\u201dUsually, the Primordial Life of cultivators wouldn\u2019t leave their body unless they were facing a life depending situation.It was already very rude for Luo Jianqing to ask Xuan Lingzi to see his Master\u2019s Primordial Life even in the past when they were in a common relationship of Master and disciple. Now, even worse.Put all the thoughts away, Luo Jianqing committed seclusion for another two months and stepped out of his house after making sure his foundation was strengthened.Standing at Xuan Lingzi\u2019s door, Luo Jianqing bowed down. Respectful he looked, but impertinent he said.\u201cMaster, do you know what is Couple Cultivation?\u201dWhat answered Luo Jianqing was a beam of magnificent sword light.This time, the golden-sword light was obviously careful. It only stroke Luo Jianqing into the air but left no harm on him.Luo Jianqing sniggered. He left Yu Xiao Peak leaving his words behind.\u201cMaster, I am leaving to find my fourth brother.\u201dLuo Jianqing transformed into a wisp of light and flew away. Sitting in his own house, Xuan Lingzi was so mad about his defiant disciple that he almost wanted to disown him and never talk to him again.Nevertheless, when Xuan Lingzi calmed himself down, he mumbled, \u201cCouple Cultivation? How on earth\u2026\u2026\u201dHe didn\u2019t finish the sentence for he realized what the heck it is. Irritated, Xuan Lingzi flicked his sleeves in anger. Luo Jianqing\u2019s bamboo house collapsed into ashes.As for now, Luo Jianqing had no idea that his house was already destroyed by his ferocious Master. Landed at Hao Ming Peak, he found Xie Zizhuo \u2013 whom he hadn\u2019t seen for four years.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe was still dressed in black, but he had grown up quite a lot since the last time he saw him several years back.As soon as Luo Jianqing reached Hao Ming Peak, he saluted his senior brother and greeted him respectfully. Seeing this, Luo Jianqing was very surprised. He sized up his junior brother who had never been acting politely, then he said with a smile: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? Why are you being so docile today? Have you been scolded by Master Guang Lingzi?\u201dWith a twitch of his mouth, Xie Zizhuo\u2019s face darkened, \u201cMaster Guang didn\u2019t scold me today.\u201dLuo Jianqing raised his eyebrows and said, \u201cReally?\u201dXie Zizhuo threw up his hands, \u201cHe despises me every day, okay?\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026.\u201dThey talked while walking towards Xie\u2019s house. There were nearly a hundred outer disciples and dozens of inner disciples in Hao Ming Peak. Many junior brothers and sisters greeted them on their way up. By the time they arrived the house of Xie, Luo Jianqing had roughly figured out the situation.Five years ago, when Li Xiuchen came back from Liu Yan Valley, Sir Guang Lingzi met him in person.Although Sir Guang Lingzi didn\u2019t understand how this kid without any spiritual bones at Level 4 of Qi Refining could obtain so many Yan Fruits, Li Xiuchen had nonetheless made both Tai Hua Mountain and himself look good. Therefore, he ignored Xie Zizhuo\u2019s complains and reinstated Li Xiuchen\u2019s position back to an inner disciple and scolded Xie, \u201cYou are their senior brother. How could you be so mean to your junior brothers? I have asked Master Wang to heal him. When he recovers, you would be his instructor. Understand?\u201dXie Zizhuo was speechless.Fortunately, Li Xiuchen did not like Xie Zizhuo either, so he seldomly went to check on Xie. Otherwise, Luo Jianqing had no doubt that his fourth junior brother would be driven crazy by Li Xiuchen and end up killing him.Xie Zizhuo said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand. I don\u2019t understand it! I\u2019ve never seen a cultivator without spiritual bones could reach Level 9 of Qi Refining in just seven years! He was already a step away from reaching Foundation Establishment! It doesn\u2019t make sense! I was only an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator at his age, and I was nowhere near reaching the Middle Stage, but he is now already infinitely close to breaking through to the Foundation Establishment!\u201dWith a stern expression, Luo Jianqing said, \u201cMaybe we are wrong. Maybe he is a one-in-the-million genius. Even without spiritual bones, he could absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to accelerate his cultivation?\u201dXie Zizhuo, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dAfter a while, Xi Zizhuo lowered his voice and whispered, \u201cYou seem to have changed your opinion on Li Xiuchen ever since the Sects\u2019 competition. Earlier on, I thought we both don\u2019t like people who only rely on sheer luck to do things, but it seems\u2026. you don\u2019t think that way\u2026.\u201dUpon hearing that, Luo Jianqing halted his steps suddenly and Xie Zizhuo looked back at him.Luo Jianqing smiled causally with his black hair fluttering in the wind and said with a gentle voice, yet his words were chilling as hell, \u201cWhat makes you think that I have a good opinion of that arrogant, stupid, disrespectful brat?\u201dXie Zizhuo was dumbfounded, and after a while, he burst into laughter with his hands covering his belly.After entering Xie Zizhuo\u2019s room, Luo Jianqing briefly recounted what had happened to him in the past few years and he also mentioned a thing or two about Mo Qiu. Xie Zizhuo slightly nodded his head and filled him in on the things happened in Tai Hua Mountain when he was not around. In the end, he asked out of curiosity, \u201cShouldn\u2019t you go ask Second Brother about this? He was much more familiar with Tai Hua Mountain. If you ask him, he would tell you everything he knows.\u201dLuo Jianqing was touching the tea cup. Hearing what he said, he stopped and looked up at him, \u201cSecond Brother was busy with his cultivation, so I came to you instead.\u201dXie Zizhuo: \u201c\u2026In fact, I am also very busy with my cultivation.\u201dLuo smiled and said nothing.When Luo was about to leave, Xie Zizhuo said seriously: \u201cThe competition will be held in a year and a half, and although Li Xiuchen may not have broken through the Qi Refining stage by then, as a Level-9 Qi Refining cultivator, there is still a high possibility that he will win anyway. I am frustrated whenever I think about it. With a solemn face, Luo replied, \u201cYou are bigger than this.\u201dXie Zizhuo twitched his mouth and said, \u201cWell, well, well. I will not bother with this ridiculous guy any more. Let\u2019s talk about Junior Sister. She has been fond of you for so many years. You are the only one she loves, and if you can\u2019t be together in the future\u2026 I can\u2019t even imagine what that would be like.The smile on his face gradually faded away. After a while, he sighed and said, \u201cI will go to talk with Junior Sister again.\u201dThey said goodbye at Hao Ming Peak.Luo Jianqing did not stop his steps but flew straight towards Qing Lan Peak. Qing Lan Peak was known for its practice in alchemy and had a lot of female disciples on the mountain. As soon as Luo Jianqing arrived at Qing Lan Peak, a female disciple exclaimed, \u201cSenior Brother is here. Senior Sister must be in a good mood today seeing you here. Go tell her quickly.\u201dLuo Jianqing put on a bitter smile.After a short while, Mu Tianxin showed up in front of Luo wearing red clothes.The moment Mu approached Luo, she directly stuffed several jade bottles into his arms and complained, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you give me a heads-up when you left three months ago? I heard from Master that you had gone back to Yu Xiao Peak when I came back from gathering herbs for you. You were heavily wounded, and these elixirs are refined in the past few months by me. They are not as effective as those produced by Masters and Elders, they nonetheless could help you strengthen your body. I was planning to send these over to you in a couple of days.Luo was in a hurry last time when he came to Qing Lan Peak and back then he was busy dealing with Xuan Lingzi, so he didn\u2019t spend much time with Mu Tianxin. This time, when he looked down at his Junior Sister, he was surprised to find that she had put down her hair which was always tied up into two ponytails.Black long hair was fluttering in the wind with setting sun illuminating on her bright and charming face, which seemed so pretty and attractive. No one could deny that among the Seven Sons of Tai Hua, Mu Tianxin was the dream girl of many senior and junior brothers throughout the Tai Hua Mountain.Although Mu Tianxin was domineering with a fiery temper, she was nonetheless a cute little girl compared to that cold Third Sister Wei Qiongyin and her beauty had swept many disciples off their feet.At the same time in his previous life, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t meet his Junior Sister.She had been training in seclusion for ten years. She got in when she was still an early-stage Gold Core cultivator and when she came out, she had become a middle-stage Gold Core cultivator.Since she came out, she had never dressed herself in red again, instead she would wear a black robe every day. She seldom smiled and got far away from Luo Jianqing gradually. It was not until she was rescued by Li Xiuchen several times back when they finally began to date, but she didn\u2019t smile and talk as much as before.Noticing that Luo\u2019s eyes was fixing on her, Mu Tianxin\u2019s touched her hair with fingers and kept fiddling with the hair to cover the excitement in her heart. She whispered, \u201cFourth brother said that girls should be gentle and most men like that. Perhaps\u2026. you like that type of girl too?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d Luo Jianqing smiled. He reached out and took out two small and delicate miniate ribbons.When he waved the ribbons in the air, they suddenly took away the color of the misty sky and burst into a light like crystal. Seeing that, Mu Tianxin immediately snatched them away.When she got the ribbons, Mu Tianxin suddenly felt wrong about it, so she quickly stuffed them back into Luo Jianqing\u2019s hands, \u201cI just\u2026 I didn\u2019t mean to do that, I am not a willful person.\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled: \u201cMy little sister, even if you meant to do that, no one would say a word about it.\u201dWhile he was talking, Luo Jianqing walked towards the back of Mu Tianxin, and rolled up the hair she put down. He gently put the black hair on his palm, combed it carefully, and then tied up the hair with the ribbons. After he finished one side, he continued to tie up the other one. Luo Jianqing was not good at it, but the magnificent ribbons were enough to make up for his lack of skills, and they totally brought out the gorgeousness and beauty of Mu Tianxin.Mu Tianxin touched the two ribbons and she couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201cDo you really like me in this way\u201dThe smile on Luo\u2019s face gradually faded away and he replied with a serious face, \u201cYou will always be my Junior Sister.\u201dHearing that, Mu Tianxin was struck dumb.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis time, she sensed the firm determination from his words. She couldn\u2019t bring herself to look at Luo\u2019s face. Then, she heard a gentle laughter, which was just as appealing as it had always been over the past few decades. Luo Jianqing said, \u201cJunior Sister, I have to tell you that I\u2019m falling in love with someone now, and\u2026 he likes me too. Being in love is torturous. Like you, I used to think that love is a personal thing. If he couldn\u2019t accept me, I would keep my feeling to myself and continue to love him in my own way, even if it death is the outcome.\u201dMu Tianxin hold the ribbon tightly.Luo Jianqing continued, \u201cJunior Sister, you told me it would break your heart if I lie to you. But for me, if I don\u2019t make it clear to you, I would be hurting you. What kind of brother would I be if that happens?\u201dMu Tianxin lowered her head.Luo Jianqing went on, \u201cSo, I want to tell you today that I know you like me. But I\u2019m not the one for you in this life. Ordinary people can only live up to a hundred years, but a cultivator\u2019s life can be boringly long. I could be your Senior Brother and hold your hand for a while, but nothing more.The wind howled through peaks and blew across the surface of the sea, causing roaring waves.After a long while, Mu Tianxin asked in a hoarse voice, \u201cWhat\u2019s she like? (in Chinese, the word \u201che\u201d and \u201cshe\u201d sound the same) How did you know her? Does she look prettier than me? Is she gentler than me? Does.. does she care more about you than I do?\u201dLuo Jianqing froze for a while and realized that his junior sister had mistaken him for a girl; however, he said nothing about it, and instead replied, \u201cI don\u2019t think he is prettier or gentler than you, but he cares about me.I\u2019m very sure of that. My little sister is the most beautiful girl in the entire Tai Hua Mountain, and no one in the world would dare hurt you. If there were, we would kill him.\u201dMu Tianxin stayed silent for a while and then her shoulders started shaking slightly. Luo Jianqing looked down at her with gentle and pampering eyes.After a while, Mu Tianxin suddenly burst into tears and stepped forward to hug Luo Jianqing. She held him tightly as if she wanted to remember what it felt like to hold him, and she simply wouldn\u2019t let go.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t stop her, and then he felt his shoulders gradually went wet.Her aggrieving wailing echoed throughout the Qing Lan Peak. She was a proud, self-conscious girl, but right now she didn\u2019t care how this would be perceived by others any more. She kept on crying, as if she wanted to drain off the love she had felt towards him over the past forty years and let it go with all the tears.When the sun set, she gradually calmed down. She let go of his body and said in a hoarse voice, \u201cSenior Brother, this is the first time, and also the last time\u2026. Could you kiss me, please?\u201dMu Tianxin looked up with tears on her face and watery eyes swollen like little peaches, which made her such a pitiful girl.However, Luo Jianqing shook his head. He looked at his little sister and said, \u201cJunior Sister, I like him, so I won\u2019t kiss you, because you are my sister and I have fallen in love with him.\u201dHearing that, Mu Tianxin raised her chin and made an unpleasant sound. Then she said without hesitation, \u201cHumm, that\u2019s more like it. That is my Senior Brother. That girl is so lucky. I\u2019m so jealous about her. If she wants to be a member of Tai Hua Mountain, she should come to me first! Senior Brother, I\u2019m telling you. If you want to marry that girl, I would prepare a big gift for you, but\u2026.she has to defeat me in a fight first.Upon hearing that, Luo Jianqing laughed, \u201cAre you sure? You want him to defeat you?\u201dStill thinking the one was a \u201cshe\u201d, Mu Tianxin replied in a rather high-pitched voice, \u201cOf course! Who am I? I\u2019m Mu Tianxin of the Qing Lan Peak! If she dare hurt me, I would tell my master to kick her ass!\u201dAfter exchanging a few more words, Mu Tianxin turned around and left proudly. Her face was still glamorous as always, except for the tears and watery eyes. She was still the proud, dream girl of the Qing Lan Peak.However, when Mu Tianxin walked to the end of the mountain road, she suddenly halted her steps and asked in a weak voice without looking back, \u201cSenior Brother, when we played at the Beasts Park of the Yu Shou Peak thirty-five years ago, we were so happy that we completely lost track of the time. When it was getting dark outside, all the beasts started to snarl. Then you hold me and told me not to be afraid and you said that you would protect me forever. Senior Brother\u2026. Do you remember that?\u201dLuo Jianqing lowered his eyes and whispered, \u201cI do.\u201dMu Tianxin froze upon hearing this reply.Luo Jianqing closed his eyes and smiled, \u201cMy little sister, I will not allow you to be bullied by anyone. If anyone dares, he would have to kill me first before he can get to you. As your brother, I would make it my mission to protect you.\u201dMu Tianxin stood at the end of the mountain road for a long time, then suddenly flew away with a slight tap of feet on the ground. She was like a burning fireball rushing into the forests. She left decisively without the least hesitation and disappeared in front of Luo Jianqing.\u2018It\u2019s better to solve things earlier.\u2019After gazing at the green Qing Lan Peak for a while, Luo Jianqing turned around and left with a sigh.The competition of the Seven Peaks would be held in one year. He once challenged Xuan Lingzi and asked what he would do if he lost the competition. Maybe he got pissed off back then. He didn\u2019t realize that Luo was a Nascent Soul cultivator. Among all the disciples of his age, only Luo Jianqing achieved this stage now. Absent of any capable competitor, he was the champion.Even though Luo Jianqing had outmatched the younger generation of the Tai Hua Mountain and were even recognized as one of the top geniuses of the entire Xuan Tian Continent, he wanted more.His goal had always been to surpass that person who had achieved Immortal Period. In order to do that, he would have to reach Immortal Period too!Along the way from Qing Lan Peak back to Yu Xiao Peak, Luo Jianqing had thought about how to cultivate in the next year. He would go to Wan Shou Peak to accumulate his practical ability in the last few months and maybe he could get some precious treasures along the way. However, before he could think this through, he suddenly noticed that his bamboo house was in ruins.Luo Jianqing: \u201c\u2026\u201dHe looked around over and over.Well, this was the right way. This was the right place.So, this pile of bamboo and wood\u2026 Was this the bamboo house the one that he had lived in for decades? !Luo Jianqing stepped forward and stooped down to pick up a piece of fractured bamboo. Then he examined it carefully. It was shattered by spiritual power. In fact, there was no need to check it at all. It was easily to be known that in the entire Xuan Tian Continent, except the horrible Demon Exalt and the Devil Exalt of the Mo Dao Palace, who else could destroy the bamboo house next to his door under Xuan Lingzi eyes.Did the Demon Exalt come out in violation of the contract? No.Did the Devil Exalt leave the Mo Dao Palace and sneak into Tai Hua Mountain? No.So, who else could it be? It didn\u2019t take a genius to figure out that his master, who had been provoked by him many times, was probably the perpetrator.Curling up his lips, Luo Jianqing got up and dusted off his robe. With the green-edged white robe fluttering in the wind, a handsome cultivator calmly walked to the bamboo house beside. With slender and exquisite phoenix eyes looking down slightly, Luo Jianqing greeted respectfully and said calmly, \u201cMaster, my house was ruined. I don\u2019t know where to stay tonight.\u201dIt was dead silent in the bamboo house.Luo Jianqing did not give up, but said, \u201cMaster, there are only you and me on Yu Xiao Peak. Today, I have been to a lot of places. I have talked with Fourth Brother about the Sects affairs, and then went to Qing Lan Peak to talk with Junior Sister. Now I\u2019m exhausted. Please open the door, Master, so I could have a rest.\u201dThe bamboo leaves swayed gently, but there was still no answer.Upon seeing that, Luo Jianqing changed his facial expression and shouted, \u201cMaster, I don\u2019t know who dared destroy my bamboo house, knowing that you, the top one cultivator in the world, the elder of the Tai Hua Mountain was around! It\u2019s like a slap on the face for the Tai Hua Mountain and you! How could you tolerate this evil behavior? Master, I will catch that bad guy and bring him back to you, then\u2026.\u201d\u201cShut up.\u201d The cold voice suddenly broke the air. It seemed calm and indifferent, but with a touch of obvious hatred. Xuan Lingzi lowered his voice and said word by word, \u201cLuo Jianqing, since when have you become so\u2026so rude!\u201dLuo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help but laugh.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49 - Look Back into the Past (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 49: Look Back into the Past (3)Like him, his master was also born in this desolate Yu Xiao Peak and they both grew up here. Luo Jianqing was regarded as a courteous role model by countless junior brothers and sisters in previous life, and likewise, he held Xuan Lingzi in high regard and he modeled himself after Xuan. Because he wanted to get close to Xuan, he couldn\u2019t help but imitate him in every way possible.So, it was not surprising that, even though he was now so furious, he still couldn\u2019t bring himself to call his names and instead only managed to accuse him repeatedly of being rude.Back when he fell into Fiend Path and had been marked for death for years, Luo Jianqing had never thought that he could be like this. The courteous Senior Brother of the Tai Hua Mountain had been dead the moment he got expelled. Now, he was just a man wearing a perfect mask and he was no longer that reserved, aloof man that he had always been before.He desired higher Cultivation Base; he wanted to kill Li Xiuchen and take back the Heaven Path.He wanted to get that person!In fact, aside from their indiscriminate slaughter of innocent people, Luo Jianqing rather envied those Devil Cultivators. They were wild, intractable and arbitrary, and they could do whatever they wanted. They were completely different from those so-called righteous cultivators who were restrained by so many things.He had been meaning to wear the perfect mask all the time in this life, but things didn\u2019t always work out the way he had wanted.Xuan was still that revered master of the Yu Xiao Peak; however, Luo was no longer the First Disciple of the Tai Hua Mouantain.After standing in front of the bamboo house for a long while, Luo Jianqing still didn\u2019t get a reply, so he sighed, \u201cMaster, I understand.\u201dAfter finishing those words, Luo Jianqing turned around and picked up the fractured bamboo and wood on the ground. He started cutting down bamboos in the bamboo forest to build another house for himself. When the sun rose again the next day, the house was done.Looking at this new bamboo house, his mind began to wander back to thirty years ago.He moved into this bamboo house at the age of ten, and he had been living with that man ever since. At that time, Luo Jianqing had not practiced inedia, so other disciples would send food for him from the foot of the hill every day and Sir Xuan Lingzi would eat with him. Because his master usually remained silent while eating, Luo Jianqing dare not say a word at the table.After the breakfast came a whole day of cultivation. Xuan Lingzi would sit on the bamboo couch with legs crossed and little Luo Jianqing would sit next to him. However, Luo Jianqing was still a child back then and such long-hour meditation was simply too much for him. Therefore, this six-year-old Luo would often fell asleep, and when he woke up, he would find himself lying on Xuan\u2019s legs and he could see a handsome face looking down at him.Back then, Luo could not hold back his impulse to touch that man\u2019s hair before his eyes. And Xuan Lingzi would usually sigh and said, \u201cJianqing, let go of it.\u201dBut even if Luo didn\u2019t lose his hold on the hair, Xuan Lingzi would not take further actions to stop him.Xuan Lingzi planned to cultivate in the evening. However, that was usually the time when Luo Jianqing fell asleep. One day, after he rolled up to sleep on Xuan\u2019s legs for countless times and grumbled in dissatisfaction, Xuan Lingzi picked up the jade-like boy and slept with him without undressing.Since then, Luo Jianqing would roll into his arms every day and fell into sleep in the most comfortable place.They huddled up together in that cold and small bamboo house and that had been going on for four years.When Luo Jianqign was ten years old, Xuan Lingzi build a bamboo house for him and expected him to sleep in that house and devote himself to cultivation. At that time, Luo Jianqing was at level-five of Qi Refining, but deep down, he was still a child. So, he was naturally unhappy about the news that he had to leave his beloved master all of a sudden.So that night, he sneaked into the room of Xuan Lingzi in hope that he could sleep in his arms again.Unexpectedly, Xuan Lingzi refused him ruthlessly and scolded him in a cold voice. Seeing that, Luo Jianqing was dumbfounded. Xuan Lingzi continued, \u201cI asked you to live in that bamboo house and devote yourself to cultivation. Jianqing, have I not made myself clear earlier? Or are you deliberately trying to disobey my orders?Under the moonlight, Xuan Lingzi looked emotionless with his stern eyes.Luo Jianqing was struck dumb when he saw the face of his master. He dare not say a word. After a while, Xuan Lingzi sighed in resignation. Then he took Luo to bed and hugged him in arms while whispering, \u201cJust for this once. Jianqing\u2026 sleep now.\u201dSince then, Luo Jianqing never went back again. He was really scared by the stern face of Xuan Lingzi. Now, he was reminded of all those things while standing in front of this new bamboo house. After observing it for a long while, he still could not help but mutter, \u201cMaster, I\u2019m not accustomed to this new house. Could I still have one more chance to \u2026. just for once?\u201dNo one answered.He did not say one more word but took out his Fu Shuang Sword and walked into the bamboo forest to cultivate. In the green bamboo forest, a cultivator in white constantly waved his sword like he was dancing, and he drew numerous perfect arcs in the air.When Luo Jianqing thrusted his sword forward, the bamboo leaves would shake silently; when he withdrew his sword, the ground would be covered in swirling dusts.When Fu Shuang Sword was sent spinning in the air, Luo Jianqing began to make handprint in his hands. When the handprint was done, he pointed at it with a finger. Then the handprint was embedded onto the Floating Frost Sword which formed a horrible sword shadow.A dazzling, powerful energy wave was unleashed from the edge of the sword and right when it was going to illuminate all the forest, it suddenly dimmed down. The sword wave was coming at Luo Jianqing in the reverse direction. At that moment, a golden sword wave pierced the sky, stopping the wave flying to Luo and crushing it.He hurriedly looked back and yelled, \u201cMaster!\u201dHowever, when he turned back, he saw nothing but an empty forest.Luo Jianqing shook his head in resignation and picked up the Floating Frost Sword on the ground. Then he returned to his bamboo house. He officially began his secluded training and tried to break through the bottleneck. He meant to consolidate his cultivation and improve his spiritual power in the hope that he could also perform the kind of sword wave he saw in the forest.On the Yu Xiao Mountain, both of them secluded themselves in their own bamboo house and never went out.Xie Zizhuo had come here to check on them for three times, Zuo Yunmo two times and Mu Tianxin once. None of them get any reply from Luo and Xuan. They guessed that they were in secluded training, and so they all left. Four months before the competition, Luo Jianqing suddenly opened his eyes with a beam of light flying through.At the same time, an average-looking disciple was packing up in Hao Ming Peak. He was preparing to gain some chances before the competition in order to improve his cultivation. However, he didn\u2019t know that across the mountain not far from him, Luo Jianqing was standing in front of his bed, looking out towards the direction of Hao Ming Peak with abstruse eyes. He whispered, \u201cIt\u2019s about time to go out.\u201dThat disciple was none other than Li Xiuchen.And he was going to Wan Shou Peak. Coincidentally\u2026 Luo Jianqing was heading up there, too!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50 - I would give Xuan Ling Sword to others for you (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 50: I would give Xuan Ling Sword to others for you (1)It was known to all cultivators in the world that the perseverance, consciousness and willpower of cultivators were more important than spiritual bones. All of them were indispensable. If you have those three elements, you could become a top-level cultivator even with poor spiritual bones. Hundreds of years ago, the Four Demon Exalts entered an agreement with Xuan Lingzi according to which Xuan was banned from stepping out of Tai Hua Mountain.In case that it would cause chaos if more cultivators knew about it, only cultivators above the Da Cheng Period, except Luo Jianqing, knew about this agreement. Born with supernatural bones, it only took Sir Xuan Lingzi three hundred years to break through Deity Transformation stage. To some extent, he had surpassed the cultivators of Ancient Times.However, it did not mean that Xuan Lingzi was not favored by chance.When he was young, he had involved himself in countless battles between the two species and had been to various dangerous places. It had been said that he once challenged a nine-level demon beast in Wan Shou Peak when he was in Tribulation Passage Period. Xuan Lingzi had a lot of chance. He often obtained big chance or breakthrough when his life was hung by a thread. As if with the help of God, he reached Deity Transformation stage within only three hundred years, which shocked the world.However, now the Demon was forbidding Xuan from growing stronger in order to prevent him from breaking through the next stage and dominating the war between them.Just like when Li Xiuchen came back from Liu Yan Valley, Sir Guang Lingzi didn\u2019t get suspicious when he checked his body and found no spiritual bones. He believed that Li Xiuchen was that kind of person with perseverance, consciousness, willpower, and most importantly, blessed with big chance.Now, Li Xiuchen was leaving for Wan Shou Peak to find chance as Sir Guang Lingzi had predicted.Before he left, Li Xiuchen came to Hao Ming Peak to bid farewell to his Master. Sir Guang Lingzi was glad to see that and delightedly gave Li Xiuchen a defensive magic treasure. He also urged Li Xiuchen to work hard to seize a chance. After talking with his Master, Li Xiuchen came to Xie Zizhuo who was standing next to him.Xie Zizhuo, who was dressed in black, said sarcastically, \u201cWhat? I know you are leaving. Just go.\u201dAfter making a salute, Li Xiuchen said, \u201cBrother Xie, I\u2019m too young and I know I have offended you many times before. I apologize for that. Please forgive me.\u201dSeeing that, Xie Zizhuo twitched his lips. Just when he was about to say something, he heard Sir Guang Lingzi saying, \u201cLook at him. What a gentleman! It\u2019s pretty rare that one should seek chance months before the competition. That shows perseverance. To some extent, you are his teacher too. In my opinion, you should lend him your Floating Cloud Blade so he can have something to protect him when he was endangered.\u201dXie Zizhuo suddenly widened his eyes in disbelief and looked to his master: \u201cMaster, you are asking me to lend him Floating Cloud Blade?!\u201dThe burly Sir Guang Lingzi sat on his chair looking like a mountain. Upon hearing his question, he frowned, \u201cWhat? You seem unhappy about this? I heard you have been playing all the time and spent little time instructing your junior brother.\u201dThese words greatly infuriated Xie Zizhuo.They immediately started bickering with no regard to the fact that they were in a hall.Guang Lingzi was a rough diamond himself and it came as no surprise that he should have a disciple as uncouth as Xie Zizhuo. They didn\u2019t look like a couple of master and disciple at all. One said, \u201cYou are his master. Why do you teach him yourself?\u201d The other retorted, \u201cI am your master. Do as I say.\u201d This back-and-forth squabble continued for a long while. In the end, Xie Zizhuo got so furious that he took out his Floating Cloud Blade, ready to charge, but with a crook of Guang Lingzi\u2019s finger, he was easily suppressed.Xie Zizhuo stared at his master furiously. Seemingly having perceived the anger of his beloved disciple, Guang Lingzi burst into laughter and waved his arm to deliver Li Xiuchen another magic treasure. \u201cDon\u2019t mind him. Take this. There was half of my power in it to keep you safe when you are at a critical moment.Li Xiuchen was overjoyed, \u201cThank you Master!\u201dXie Zizhuo was suppressed on the ground and trying to hold back his impulse to defect from his school.Soon, Li Xiuchen left the hall. He couldn\u2019t help but smile, all the while scanning the magic treasures in his interspatial ring with the help of spiritual sense. Although Li Xiuchen didn\u2019t look handsome, he was nonetheless quite known these days. He was not popular in Hao Ming Peak, but it\u2019s better than before.Li Xiuchen was not the same loser he had once been in his previous life in which he cared nothing other than reading pirated e-books. He was nineteen years old this year and he had become quite reserved since he came back from Liu Yan Valley.\u201cNow everything seems going on as planned, so I will still go to Wan Shou Peak to get my chance. It doesn\u2019t matter that I didn\u2019t got accepted by the Yu Xiao Peak. I\u2019m a nine-level cultivator of Qi Refining, and I\u2019m bound to reach Foundation Establishment next year. By then, I will follow the plot and see where the plot will take me. Hahhahah.\u201dThinking about this, Li Xiuchen couldn\u2019t help but put on a wretched smile.Although it had only been a few months since he went to Wan Shou Peak, he unexpectedly got himself a potential second wife. The first one was Mu Tianxin who he had already slept with in the ruins. Since he had no connection with Mu Tianxin now, he was planning to replace her with this future second wife.Reminded of the words \u201cwild and hot\u201d, Liu Xiuchen could hardly hold back his lust.Soon, Li Xiuchen handed in an application to the elders before he left. On his out, he kept thinking how the Seeking Immortality entered his mind while passing through to this world. Now he had to be cautious as he was seeking for chance and the second wife.He hoped that it would not be like that last time with Mu Tianxin and that he would be able to meet Mu Ruorong.Li Xiuchen trembled, and then he sped up.However, at that moment he didn\u2019t know that a handsome and elegant cultivator dressed in blue was sitting idly at the tip of the tree five miles behind him looking up at the clear blue sky. Back then Li Xiuchen was a nine-level Qi Refining cultivator and he was only a bit better than ordinary people in speed. So when he had gone far, this cultivator in blue slowly moved forward and followed him calmly.This cultivator was Luo Jianqing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51 - I would give Xuan Ling Sword to others for you (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 51: I would give Xuan Ling Sword to others for you (2)After getting out of the bamboo house that day, Luo Jianqing simply packed a few things and went to Xuan Lingzi\u2019s to bid farewell.Luo Jianqing clasped his hands to give a salute. Then he curled up his lips to make a smile and said, \u201cMaster, I want to practice outside before the competition. Since entering the Nascent Soul, I have no other practical experience except that time with you, so I want to go to Wan Shou Peak to kill the monster and improve my ability.\u201dAfter a long while of silence in the bamboo house, a beam of golden light suddenly came out and flew straight to Luo Jianqing.Standing there still, Luo Jianqing took out Floating Frost Sword and put it in front of his forehead. Then he whispered: \u201cMaster, you haven\u2019t recovered yet. I know what I\u2019m doing. I will never risk it. I am worried about you, so don\u2019t keep your Primordial Life following me any longer.\u201dUpon hearing those words, the golden light stopped all of a sudden, and it froze in front of Luo Jianqign only in one inch away from his forehead.After a long while, the golden light turned back to the house, but three beams of light coming out from the house instead stopped in front of Luo Jianqing.\u201cYou take these three things. The first one, you can use it to hold off the cultivator of Body Fusion Period three times; the second, there is an attack of 70% of my strength; the third, just keep it. You could replace Floating Frost Sword with it in case.\u201dHearing the cold voice, Floating Frost Sword screamed with a dissatisfied sound, but when the magic sword slightly shocked, Floating Frost Sword suddenly became silent and dare not fight any more.Luo Jianqing looked at the sword with mixed emotions and words escaped him at the moment.Yes, this sword\u2026 was the magic weapon of Xuan Lingzi, the Xuan Ling Sword.The quaint long sword had already developed sword spirit. Even without too much decoration on the sword, you still could feel the horrible momentum contained inside.Cold light flew through, emotionless glitter it shone.It was this sword in previous life that pierced Luo\u2019s heart and he witnessed it with disbelief.Luo Jianqing stretched out and held the sword. Then he suddenly felt a burning in his hand. It\u2019s not the Xuan Ling Sword burning him, but the person who had been holding this sword for the past three hundred years. The bitterness was overwhelming him. Luo Jianqing choked with sobs. Even he didn\u2019t remember how he started the conversation, he remembered his voice, \u201cMaster, under what circumstance, you would give this sword to others?\u201dWhen he finished, a gust of wind blew through the bamboo forest making a rustling sound.Xuan Lingzi did not answer immediately, but when Luo Jianqing felt hurt in his heart, he heard Xuan Lingzi whispering: \u201cI would only give this sword to others for you.\u201dThese words gradually disappeared in the wind. Luo Jianqing looked at the bamboo house in silence, and after making a salute, he turned around to leave.He didn\u2019t understand the meaning of what Xuan Lingzi had said, but he could understand the affirmative tone in his voice. Xuan Lingzi did not lie, so it was for him that Xuan Lingzi lend his sword to Li Xiuchen in previous life or for him to get killed?If we put it in this way, it was really for him.After having walked into the bamboo forest, Luo Jianqing suddenly halted his steps and took out Xuan Ling Sword from his waist. When he waved the sword with the power of his wrist, a beam of light rushing forward, which was so aggressive that making the dust exploded in the air.Bang!Xuan Ling Sword thrusted into the window frame next to the door of bamboo house three inches deeper.Luo Jianqing did not look back, but laughed loudly: \u201cMaster, I hope that one day you could get out of the bamboo house and hand over your sword to me in person. You used to say that cultivators should not rely too much on weapons. So, it\u2019s enough for me to have this blue bamboo umbrella and your spiritual pearl. As for the Xuan Ling Sword\u2026 it\u2019s too heavy for me. I can\u2019t take it.\u201d \u201cAfter finishing those words, he didn\u2019t wait for the reply, but took his leave.The pain in his heart gradually disappeared as the sword was thrown away. Luo Jianqing quickly found Li Xiuchen, who had just left Tai Hua Mountain. He caught up with him. He had followed him across two states before they arrived at a small town at the edge of Wan Shou Peak.After all, Li Xiuchen had seldom been away from Tai Hua Mountain. So, when he saw this fantastic town, he couldn\u2019t help but wander around. There were a lot of dead bodies of monsters and beasts, as well as various magic weapons, medicinal elixirs and spiritual animals. Although they were not attractive to Luo Jianqing, Li Xiuchen spent a while seeing them.As Luo Jianqing arrived at town, he went to the tavern where he used to live and stayed there.After he got everything in order, Luo Jianqing came to stand by the window and looked towards the direction of Tai Hua Mountain. Even he was far away from Tai Hua Mountain now, he could see the elusive spiritual power reaching into the sky which marked the center of the continent. That was Yu Xiao Peak and the spiritual power which condensed into a real thing was formed by the spiritual ridge occupied by the Yu Xiao Peak.He had been staring at Yu Xiao Peak from dawn to dusk. When the sun rose again, Luo Jianqing sighed and looked away.\u201cWhatever, let bygones be bygones. In this life\u2026just remember that he likes me. The thing in previous life has nothing to do with that in this life. Never mind. Never mind. I should not\u2026\u201d Suddenly, a heartbreaking pain came from his chest. Gritting his teeth, Luo Jianqing finally closed his eyes. The voice was mixed with indescribable hatred and pain: \u201cNo, sooner or later, I would make it clear with him. After I achieved the Immortal stage or after I forced him to get out of the bamboo house!\u201dLuo Jianqing sat down with his legs crossed to calm down.However, after he had just controlled his blood pressure and spiritual power in his body, he heard a strange voice coming from downstairs. With a frown, Luo Jianqing listened to it carefully for a while. Suddenly he was surprised to figure out what was going on and burst into laughter.It turned out that Mu Ruorong was downstairs!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52 - Li Xiuchen\u2019s Bad Luck (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWritten as one of the mistresses of Li Xiuchen in Seeking Immortality, this girl must have something special in her.Luo Jianqing knew many of the mistresses of Li Xiuchen in his last life. His little sister Mu Tianxin, for instance, a beautiful girl, specialized in alchemy, who was the most favored disciple on Qing Lan Peak, and this Mu Ruorong, who was a rouge cultivator with no sect to guide her, already reached Foundation Establishment Period within twenty years of cultivation.This level and speed of cultivation could be said as genius even among the inner-door disciples of Tai Hua Mountain, not to mention Mu Ruorong was just a rouge cultivator.Realized that there were one or two late-stage Gold Core Period cultivator in this town after all, Luo Jianqing drew back his Spiritual Sense and stood at the corner on the stairway, watching the confrontation taking place on the first floor.A tall and glamorous girl was standing at the center, watching her enemies with animosity in her eyes. Holding two scimitars in her hands, she was wearing a simple dress made by Demon Beast\u2019s fur. Not like Mu Tianxin who had a pearl like skin, Mu Ruorong\u2019s sun-kissed skin color along with her curved body made her a figure ignited lust in every man\u2019s body.From where he stood, Luo Jianqing could clearly hear the sound of swallowing saliva made by lots of men in the first floor.Li Xiuchen, who got himself a good spot, was staring lustfully at Mu Ruorong\u2019s thighs and breasts.The girl was surrounded by four early-stage Foundation Establishment Period cultivators as well as a late-stage one standing behind them, fixing his eyes on Mu Ruorong with lechery hidden in his gaze.Frowned, Mu Ruorong said, \u201cThis is not Wan Shou Peak. Behave yourselves!\u201dA Foundation Establishment Period cultivator sneered. \u201cSure, this is a civil town, out of Wan Shou Peak, so what? You are a rouge cultivator who belongs to no sect. No one is, or will be, here for you. We can kill you just like an ant! Look around yourself, which one of them will help you, hum? No one! For we are gonna kill him right away!\u201d\u201cI killed that Demon Beast, you guys were just passing by. I can see no reason why I should give you part of what I got.\u201d\u201cYou were exhausted back then. We are already treating you with manners for we didn\u2019t kill you right away. Mu Ruorong, you\u2019d better realize what you are doing. The rule of Wan Shou Peak was simply the strongest gets it all. Now, I ask you again, do you give up or not?\u201dMu Ruorong sneered, \u201cbut now we are out of the Wan Shou Peak.\u201dThe one who was standing behind the four cultivators stepped up. His gaze slithered around Mu Ruorong\u2019s buxom body and finally stopped at her breasts. Mu Ruorong was detested, but heard, \u201cwell, you asked for this. Gentlemen! Today our Five Tigers of Luo Blade needs to deal something personal with this woman. Please give us some space and do not interrupt. If anyone insist, we can\u2019t guarantee our blades know who their enemy is.\u201dThe late-stage Foundation Establishment Period cultivator unsheathed his sword and stroke towards Mu Ruorong who crossed her scimitars trying to stood her ground but still got pushed back. At the meantime, the other four cultivators surrounded her from four different directions and summoned their sword light. The shadows of blade transformed into four fierce tigers aiming at Mu Ruorong, rushing towards her with lightning speed.Thought it over, Mu Ruorong brandished her weapons. Soon the light of Spiritual Power was glimmering on the blades. A falcon emerged from the scimitar, and with a roaring crow it dived down from the air and broke the tigers into pieces.Blood belched from the four cultivators\u2019 mouth, while Luo Da waved his sword and summoned a ferocious white tiger who stared the falcon with wrath. The falcon, however, was flapping its wings which created a gigantic whirlwind.And here came a fight, tiger roaring and falcon swooping.They scuffled with each other. The falcon let out a painful moan and disappeared while its enemy roared with triumph.Mu Ruorong spat out blood and stepped back which brought her closer to Li Xiuchen\u2019s desk.This hotel seemed accustomed with fights among cultivators. One could tell this by the arena built just for this at the center. Usually, other customers could still have their meals while watching the fight and even learn something from their movements.This time, although Mu Ruorong was sure a genius, her level of cultivation was extremely lower than Luo Da. She was panting. Sweat was dripping along the curve of her neck and accumulated at her plump breasts.Many of men were gazing at her. Li Xiuchen even made a very loud noise swallowing his saliva and staring Mu Ruorong\u2019s body with fingertips slightly trembling.Seeing this, Luo Jianqing frowned with loathing but didn\u2019t interfere. Naturally, he didn\u2019t know that Li Xiuchen, who was three meters away from Mu Ruorong, was already erected.\u2018Great! Brilliant! Awesome! This buxom girl will be his woman in future! He will taste this body soon in Wan Shou Peak. The contour of her breasts, the touch of her thighs\u2026\u2026this will be soon! Soon!\u2019Li Xiuchen was carried away by his own imagination. He stared at Mu Ruorong with unabashed desire ignited in his eyes. Mu Ruorong felt it and glanced over.Obviously, the girl was sickened.Luo Da let out a laugh. \u201cYou lose! Mu Ruorong! Come with us.\u201dDidn\u2019t show a slightest tameness, Mu Ruorong brandished her scimitars and said, \u201cLuo Da, don\u2019t you dare force me. I admit that you\u2019ve defeated me, and by this reason you shall have my harvest from the Wan Shou Peak. Take that Demon Beast, now it\u2019s yours.\u201dLuo Da looked at Mu Ruorong lustfully, \u201cnow it\u2019s ours? Too late! Come!\u201dBy the moment Luo Da reached Mu Ruorong\u2019s arm, Li Xiuchen suddenly stood up and said with indignation, \u201care you guys just gonna force this girl in public? Fellow cultivator, although there was no restrict regulation in the Wan Shou Peak, if everyone\u2019s like you, who will still come here and hunt?\u201dHeard the words, everyone fixed their eyes on Li Xiuchen.Mu Ruorong looked at Li Xiuchen in surprise, while the latter one hung a poker face but couldn\u2019t help himself to peek at Mu Ruorong\u2019s breast. The girl was disgusted and turned her gaze away.Thought everything was under his control, Li Xiuchen went on. \u201cToday, I, Li Xiuchen, won\u2019t let you thugs take this girl away. If you insist, then you are my enemy!\u201dSaid these, Li Xiuchen unsheathed his sword and took out a tablet at the meantime.Luo Da was irritated, \u201cyou little rat, only at the Ninth Level of Qi Condensation Period. Who the hell do you think you are? Are you deaf or what? Piss off, this is none of your business.\u201dLi Xiuchen held the tablet higher, \u201cwell, this could be my business, for I am an inner-door disciple of Tai Hua Mountain!\u201dHis words caused an uproar in the crowd.Although there was no formal regulation in Wan Shou Peak, in the towns that stood near this mountain, there were bases of all the great cultivation sects which would send disciples annually to come over and manage the base.Tai Hua Mountain was of course, among these sects.For those rouge cultivators, Tai Hua Mountain was a Legend! They\u2019ve heard that only who reached Foundation Establishment Period within thirty-years-old was qualified to be inner door disciples. The cultivation stages of the Masters of Tai Hua Mountain were all beyond Nascent Soul Period, five of them were even at the Da Sheng Period. What\u2019s more, the one and only Deity Transformation Period cultivator was living on Tai Hua Mountain \u2013 Sir Xuan Lingzi!And they all knew, the Masters on Tai Hua Mountain\u2026\u2026won\u2019t let their disciples get bullied by others, ever.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

How could you be an inner-door disciple of Tai Hua Mountain?\u201dLuo Er told him, \u201cbrother, I heard that on Tai Hua Mountain, an inner-door disciple could be one who had reached Foundation Establishment Period within thirty years old, or one who is a gifted cultivator from the sect.\u201dStill remained suspicious, Luo Da unexpectedly received Li Xiuchen\u2019s bold challenge, who said, \u201cyou guys don\u2019t need to go easy on me. If you insist on taking this girl away, then you can do so over my dead body!\u201dThe vibe went tense. Luo Jianqing leaned on a wooden pillar, watching the whole thing in calmness.Luo Wu felt embarrassed. He stared at Li Xiuchen with hatred in his gaze. Li Xiuchen sensed it and lifted his sword pointing at Luo Wu, \u201cDo you dare for a fight?\u201dThe next moment Luo Wu threw himself towards Li Xiuchen. His shadow of blade manifested a brutal tiger ready to hunt his enemy down. Li Xiuchen brandished his sword and sealed the hand sign, \u201cmagnificent firmament, recondite sea, like a rising sun and drowning moon, this is my sword \u2013 Serene Void Sword, attack!\u201dA white sword-light whacked the tiger. Burst out a painful moan, Luo Wu lost his balance and hit the ground with a brutal gash on his chest. Li Xiuchen summoned back his sword and said condescendingly in a bluff, \u201canyone else?\u201dLuo Da and his brothers looked at Li Xiuchen in animosity. Dread of the power behind Li Xiuchen\u2019s back, they left disgruntledly.Luo Jianqing was still watching, and he, of course, saw the bleeding palm of Li Xiuchen caused by Luo Wu\u2019s shadow of blade. Li Xiuchen\u2019s been pushing himself too far. In this life, he was not practicing True Nine-pedaled Lotus Record. He maybe could defeat these rouge cultivators who didn\u2019t have the access to abundant resource, but he definitely couldn\u2019t do it that easily.Now, Li Xiuchen found his way to Mu Ruorong and asked in a bland voice, \u201cMiss, are you all right?\u201dMu Ruorong didn\u2019t really want to talk to him but still forced a smile, \u201cI\u2019m alright. Thank you for your help.\u201dLuo Jianqing chuckled and thought: oh she will be more alright if you can just hide half of your obscene stare.Li Xiuchen peeked at Mu Ruorong\u2019s breast again, \u201cthose thugs were just unreasonable. If they ever bother you again, just tell them you are under my protection. I doubt that these people will dare harass you again.\u201dMu Ruorong nodded. She didn\u2019t refuse his offer but didn\u2019t accept as well.Luo Jianqing belittled Li Xiuchen: under your or Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s protection?Li Xiuchen asked, \u201cMay I know your name?\u201dMu Ruorong hesitated, but told him at last, \u201cMu Ruorong.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s a good name.\u201dMu Ruorong didn\u2019t reply.Felt the conversation went down to a monologue, Li Xiuchen invited Mu Ruorong to have dinner with him. By the moment his hand was about to touch Mu Ruorong\u2019s, the girl moved her hand away, \u201cthanks again for your help. Your dinner is on me today, but I have to leave right now.\u201dMu Ruorong turned her back on Li Xiuchen before she even finished her sentence. Li Xiuchen wasn\u2019t prepared for this, he thought: why?! This is different from the book which wrote that Mu Ruorong would be very thankful for his help and have dinner with him. After two weeks, they will meet again in the Wan Shou Peak under the circumstances when Mu Ruorong is wounded and by that chance he saved her once again. Then, they will voyage together!\u201cCultivator Mu! Why in such a hurry? Come and eat something first.\u201dLi Xiuchen tried to grab Mu Ruorong\u2019s wrist, while the latter one squeezed her eyes and stepped back from him. Believing it was just a coincidence, Li Xiuchen didn\u2019t think it over and reached out again as if Mu Ruorong was already his mistress. \u201cthere\u2019s no need to treat me like a stranger.\u201dMu Ruorong avoided him one more time.Li Xiuchen tried for several times and finally felt something was wrong. At the moment his fingertips touched Mu Ruorong\u2019s hand, a bleak sword-light stab through his finger.\u201cAh!\u201d Li Xiuchen screamed. He pressed his finger to stop bleeding while searching around, yelling \u201cwho is it!?\u201dAnother beam of sword-light broke the air. This time, the sword-light didn\u2019t hurt Li Xiuchen but cut his hairband instead. Li Xiuchen\u2019s hair was disheveled, plus his bleeding hand, making him a drowned mouse.\u201cWho! Who is it that strikes a sneaky attack on me\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up\u201d, a boundless voice fulfilled the hotel\u2019s atmosphere with powerful Coercion, \u201cyou are such an effrontery jerk. Can\u2019t you see the girl don\u2019t want anything to do with you? Leave her alone.\u201dThe crowd was shocked.\u201cThis power of Coercion\u2026\u2026this man had reached at least the Nascent Soul Period!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it! A Nascent Soul Period cultivator came to our unheralded town!\u201dStill covering his finger, Li Xiuchen was stunned as well. He thought it over, figured that though cultivators of this level weren\u2019t that abundant on Tai Hua Mountain, there were still lots of them. He relieved completely and peeked at Mu Ruorong, said to himself that he can never let down his mistress.So he yelled to the void, \u201cSir! You get me wrong. Actually I saved her life.\u201dLuo Jianqing sneered, \u201cyou, as a ninth-level Qi Condensation Period cultivator, saved a Foundation Establishment one?\u201dLi Xiuchen felt somewhat confident, \u201cyes, I did!\u201dLuo Jianiqng\u2019s voice suddenly turned bleak. He scoffed, \u201cyou did nothing but using your identity of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciple. Since when did Tai Hua Mountain start to grant a position for a thug like you? I really wonder what your Master gonna say when he knows you harassed a girl using inner-door disciple as a bluff. You disgusted me!\u201dLi Xiuchen was irritated, \u201cyou!\u201dLuo Jianqing stretched out his fingers, mammoth sword-light emerged from air and knocked Li Xiuchen out of the hotel.Blood came out of his mouth. Before he could even take a breath, he heard the voice said, \u201cpiss off.\u201dThe other party didn\u2019t want to give him one more word!Li Xiuchen quickly got up and tried his way back to the hotel, but once he got to the gate, a powerful Spiritual Power would strike him away. After several times attempting, Li Xiuchen was already covered by mud. This drew lots of attention. People gathered to see his frustration.Disgruntled, Li Xiuchen left as soon as possible.Inside the hotel, Mu Ruorong finally relaxed. She bowed down to the air, \u201cSir, thanks to your help!\u201d, but suddenly blushed as if she was embarrassed. She left the hotel with her head hung low.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t miss a single thing. He sighed, got back to his room.He silently passed a sentence to Mu Ruorong when receiving her gratitude: if you don\u2019t respect yourself, how can you ask others to respect you?As a rouge cultivator, Mu Ruorong had a difficult life. She made lots of efforts to achieve this level of cultivation at the year of twenty. In Seeking Immortality, Mu Ruorong was described as a sexy girl with a charming visage. She\u2019s been hunting Demon Beasts since she reached fifth level of Qi Condensation Period, cultivating while making a living on hunting.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 54": "Chapter 54 - Li Xiuchen\u2019s Bad Luck (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAs a woman, particularly a less competent cultivator, Mu Ruorong needed to find herself helpers. So, when she was just a beginner, she figured out the advantage as a woman \u2013 her body. She intentionally wore sexy clothes, pretending to be lustful, fooling the men to team up with her so that she could have higher chance of survival.Loathing all these dickheads who thought nothing but get on top of her \u2013 although she was still a virgin \u2013 Mu Ruorong didn\u2019t realize that her wearing was not that appropriate.Appearance was a weapon, and Luo Jianqing knew how difficult it was to be a rouge cultivator.If Li Xiuchen wasn\u2019t a disciple of Tai Hua Mountain, Mu Ruorong would have killed him at the moment he even attempted to touch her, but she was just a rouge cultivator, therefore nobody\u2019s got her back. She could do nothing except being tolerant.However, this tolerance opened a gateway to unrespect.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t ponder about what he\u2019d interfered. Although he didn\u2019t feel Mu Ruorong annoying, in some ways he even understood her, he could hardly say he had a good feeling about her. Luo Jianiqng was quite satisfied for what he had done \u2013 Li Xiuchen didn\u2019t earn Mu Ruorong\u2019s trust today. Though it might be temporary, it was still a thing cheering enough to guarantee him a night of sweet dream. He got up early the next morning, and caught up with Li Xiuchen.Beaten by Luo Jianqing yesterday, Li Xiuchen was embarrassed, so he entered the Wan Shou Peak before dawn under the cover of darkness so that nobody could notice him. Several miles behind him, Luo Jianqing followed Li Xiuchen with a steady pace, while the latter one was cursing loudly.Hearing those words, instead of feeling offended, Luo Jianqing felt it quite hilarious.\u201cIf Master could curse like this, then I\u2019ll be damned\u201d, Luo Jianqing imagined Xuan Lingzi acting like Li Xiuchen, and was suddenly covered with goose bumps, \u201cno, no, no, definitely no\u2026\u2026that\u2019s not him at all, yep, Master shouldn\u2019t be doing this\u2026\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing followed Li Xiuchen for one hour until the tailed one met a second-level Demon Beast whose cultivation equals a fourth to sixth level of Qi Condensation Period human cultivator. Li Xiuchen killed the beasts like a piece of cake and took the Beast Core. Watching his every movement, Luo Jianqing chuckled, \u201cmeeting a second-level Demon Beast at the very edge of Wan Shou Peak, how lucky he is\u2026\u2026\u201dA second-level Demon Beast wasn\u2019t appealing to Luo Jianqing at all, so he remained quiet and kept following him.Watching Li Xiuchen hunting down several low-level Demon Beasts, Luo Jianqing was bored. He started to entertain himself by giving the frustrated beasts a hand \u2013 using his Spiritual Power helping the beast to avoid a lethal strike, so that it could continue to fight Li Xiuchen.Well, no one could blame him by that. He was helping his younger brother by creating some higher-level opponent to sharpen his skills!After taking down four or five beasts, Li Xiuchen was suspicious, \u201cwhy the heck these beasts are so difficult to tackle with?\u201dOps, seemed like he found out. Luo Jianqing sat on the top of a tree, relaxing, watching wind dancing with the clouds on the vast sapphire firmament.When Li Xiuchen slaughtered another Demon Beasts, he found this one very easy to defeat, but after he broke the beast\u2019s parietal and tried to take the Beast Core, he was surprised to see\u2026\u2026\u201cAh! Where is it? Where is that god damn Beast Core?!\u201dNot far away from him, Luo Jianqing looked at his palm. A white second-level Beast Core was there, he put it into his Interspatial RingMost Demon Beasts would form a Beast Core in their heads. Only a very few of them couldn\u2019t even form one. These beasts are counted as disabled and won\u2019t reach a higher level for they were restricted by their lacking of Beast Core.Killing four coreless beasts in a row, Li Xiuchen couldn\u2019t believe what he was experiencing.\u201cIs today a bad day?!\u201dLuo Jianqing was obviously tricking Li Xiuchen while the latter one didn\u2019t notice it at all. Luo Jianqing already collected five Beast Cores, but he only had one plan for these Beast Cores.\u201cyep, gonna give them to little sister as hoodle supplies.\u201dWatching Li Xiuchen got fooled for a whole morning, Luo Jianqing gradually lost his interest. He sent a block of stone which contained his sense to keep tailing Li Xiuchen and started to cultivate. A place like this where full of Spiritual Herbs and Demon Beasts was a perfect location to practice Nine Heavenly Seizure Record.Completed the third seizure, Luo Jianiqng found that the record became easier to understand.The Third Seizure \u2013 Seizing Right and Wrong \u2013 was not built for seizing something that had actual form but the invisible rules, boundaries and limitations among the world. Luo Jianqing was just a Nascent Soul Period cultivator, not powerful enough to seize the rule yet, but he was getting more and more familiar with the rules through every failed attempt.His power was getting stronger so he could seize more Spiritual Power from nature.For five days, Luo Jianqing closed his eyes and cultivated, letting Li Xiuchen run free in the day time and catching him up at about midnight.Before he even reached thirteen years old, Luo Jianqing was already very familiar with the outer range of the Wan Shou Peak. Li Xiuchen\u2019s speed was no faster than a snail, he didn\u2019t get out of the outer range for five days. At a place like this, Li Xiuchen might find good opportunities, but none of them would worth Luo Jianqing\u2019s attention.However, when Luo Jianqing witnessed the sixth sunrise and was about to close his eyes for cultivation, he suddenly heard a loud warble.Eyes widened, he hurried his way towards Li Xiuchen. A giant bird big as a hill was caught by his eyes. With shining golden feathers and scarlet beak, the Golden Phoenix was staring a crowd of cultivators in hatred, roaring in wrath and spurting burning flames.Li Xiuchen just arrived here and was hiding aside looking for chances.Right in front of the giant bird, three teams of fully armed cultivators were fighting with it. The weakest one among them had already reached Qi Condensation Period, and the leaders had achieved\u2026\u2026the middle-stage of Golden Core Period!A total of nineteen cultivators were taking strikes constantly.\u201cThe Golden Phoenix\u2019s weakness was at its chest! Captain! Let\u2019s aim at its chest!\u201d\u201cNo problem!\u201dThe Golden Core Period cultivator \u2013 who was referred as \u2018captain\u2019 \u2013 was bending the bow and shooting the arrow. An ice made giant arrow was infused with Spiritual Power. It was flying in a lightning speed as if it was splitting the sky in half. At last, the arrow stabbed the Phoenix right at its chest. The bird let out a painful groan. Eyes filled with destruction, it roared with drastically as if it was distaining these humans who had invaded its territory and wounded it.The cultivators made a great team. After the captain\u2019s ice arrow pierced the Golden Phoenix\u2019s chest, another Golden Core Period cultivator brandished his knife. Spiritual Power was emerging from the knife and transformed into a ferocious Lion which rushed to the bird with no hesitation.\u201cDemon Captivity String!\u201dA beam of purple light was dazzling in the hands of a dozen Qi Condensation Period cultivators. They summoned their own Demon Captivity String while sealing hand signs, making the strings tangle together to form a gigantic web. At the moment that Blade-Shadow-made lion got the Golden Phoenix and wrestled with it, the web was dropped from the sky.Another ice arrow was shot. The Phoenix saw the weapon which hurt it once, suddenly burst out an angry warble. Stretched out its wings, the bird created a wind of flame, crushed the lion using one claw and evaporated the arrow by sprouting fire.Two Golden Core Period cultivators immediately spat out blood. Their Spiritual Power was greatly damaged.\u201cCaptain!\u201d\u201cCaptain!\u201dThe two of them comforted their teammates, then looked back, staring at the Golden Phoenix which was caught by that gigantic purple web. It was captivated and had nowhere to escape. The leaders still couldn\u2019t let their guard down. Suddenly, they exchanged looks and rushed toward the confined bird.\u201cSerene Iced Arrow!\u201d\u201cWrath Lion Blade!\u201dWith an ice arrow escorting aside, a lion was dashing toward the Golden Phoenix. Seeing its enemies getting closer and closer, the Phoenix flapped its wings desperately and created mammoth flame whirlwind, but still, it was caught by the web with nowhere to hide.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 55": "Chapter 55 - Li Xiuchen\u2019s Bad Luck (4)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAt last, the lion completed its mission, left the giant ice arrow inside the Phoenix\u2019s chest.Blood was belching from the wound, the beast immediately went quiet, obviously it was badly injured. The three teams of cultivators relieved, but before they celebrated their victory, the body of Phoenix started to glimmer with golden light. One of the captains yelled nervously, \u201cWatch out! It\u2019s gonna use the gifted skill \u2013 Ignite Fire to Bring Renascence!\u201dNot far away from the Phoenix, Luo Jianqing was observing the whole thing.Golden Phoenix was born with fifth-level Demon Cultivation. Some were saying this kind of bird was a descent of Holy Phoenix. Though the lineage was not that pure, Golden Phoenix owned very similar gifted skill with its ancestor \u2013 Ignite Fire to Bring Renascence. A pure breed Phoenix\u2019s Nirvana was a profound ability containing tremendous power, but Ignite Fire to Bring Renascence was only a crude counterfeit. The latter one could only quicken the healing of wound in fifteen minutes, giving the Golden Phoenix a chance to survive, but after this short period of time, the Golden Phoenix would drop back to fourth-level and could never get back to the fifth-level for the rest of its life.These crowd of rougr cultivators must be very powerful so that the Golden Phoenix was forced to use its gifted skill. Luo Jianqing put his eyes on Li Xiuchen who was standing yonder. Li was gripping his sword as if he was waiting for the right time.Luo Jianqing remembered, as described in Seeking Immortality, Li Xiuchen reaped Golden Phoenix\u2019s treasures and Best Core and was hunted by lots of cultivators because of this. The book explained that Li Xiuchen didn\u2019t know these cultivators paid their efforts trying to tackle the bird, but they forced him to hand in the Phoenix\u2019s treasures that Li Xiuchen got by giving the Phoenix a last thump.Unfair! Unjust! Unreasonable! Li Xiuchen deserved the treasures and the Best Core. He got it by his own effort!\u2026\u2026that\u2019s basically what the book was trying to convey.Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t agree with it.These rouge cultivators had forced the Golden Phoenix to use its gifted skill, and that was an undeniable proof on how hard they\u2019ve fought. First they needed to find the bird, then lure it away from its nest, finally they had to defeat it. Li Xiuchen did nothing but giving a strike. It was reasonable that they asked Li Xiuchen to return what he got.Nevertheless, the powerful ones could do whatever they want at the Wan Shou Peak. Li Xiuchen\u2019s action was indeed effrontery but actually normal at the same time. It was also reasonable for these guys to hunt Li Xiuchen. All of his treasures would be theirs as long as they hunted him down.The law of jungle was a fundamental rule in Wan Shou Peak.The Golden Phoenix immediately mended its power back to its peak and destroyed the giant web. Now, on the other side, the cultivators were all lacking Spiritual Power and badly wounded.\u201cGuys, if we could hold it for another fifteen minutes, the bird will be ours!\u201d\u201cGot it!\u201dThe cultivators all used their final skill. Facing the burning flames of the Golden Phoenix, no doubt some were hit, lying on the ground with blood dripping from their mouths. Someone\u2019s limb was cut by the beast\u2019s whirlwind, moaning with tremendous pain.Fifteen minutes was a short period of time, but, for them, it was a time desperately long.Of course Li Xiuchen wouldn\u2019t reveal himself now. Luo Jianqing was just standing there and watching.This was the rule of the Wan Shou Peak. No one\u2019s gonna give you a hand. Luo Jianqing could step up and easily put down this Golden Phoenix, but all the rewards would be his, leaving none for the rouge cultivators. If Luo Jianqing was just trying to help, still, the teams\u2019 efforts were made for void.Only because Luo Jianqing was a Nascent Soul Period cultivator.Time was passing. There were only a few seconds left. The Phoenix\u2019s power was descending. The bird was clever, quickened its escaping. Flapping its wings trying to get away from its assailants, the Golden Phoenix was about to fly up to the sky. At the moment its cultivation dropped back to fourth-level, Li Xiuchen rushed towards the beast with excitement.\u201cYou devil beast! Come back!\u201dBrandishing his sword pointing at the Golden Phoenix, Li Xiuchen followed the beast up to the sky. When his sword-light almost hit the Phoenix, a bice light dazzled right before his eyes.\u201cAh!\u201dLi Xiuchen fell off from the sky and landed beside the rouge cultivators. The Golden Phoenix was weakened. Luo Jianqing\u2019s sword light made it burst out a painful howl and drop to the ground as well.Speechless, the rouge cultivators were stunned.After a while, the Gold Core Period cultivator got up, calmed down his turbulent Spiritual Power and said in a loud voice, \u201cwe are grateful for your help, sir. You may take this Golden Phoenix if you want, we only ask for its feathers.\u201dWhile talking, the cultivator tried his best pretending to be calm, but still couldn\u2019t hide away the animosity.The nineteen of them took pains finding the Golden Phoenix, used lots of instruments to draw it out, and wounded it to a point where it had to use its gifted skill. Now the higher level cultivator was gonna take most of the rewards while only generated a sword-light. No one would willingly hand in what they deserved.However, angry they might be, they won\u2019t dare risk their lives to fight with someone who was clearly far more powerful than them.To their surprise, Luo Jianqing responded, \u201cI did not kill this Golden Phoenix.\u201d\u201cSir?\u201d\u201cI saw this nuisance tried to claim the prize, so I forced him back with my sword-light. The Phoenix was so frightened that it fell off by itself. I had to intention to kill it.\u201dThe cultivator was elated, \u201cyou have all our thanks, sir!\u201dHid in darkness, Luo Jianqing smiled.The rouge cultivators killed the Golden Phoenix not long after they seized it. The captain finally recalled that there was someone who skulked trying to take their beast. He found Li Xiuchen and clearly won\u2019t let him get away from this easily. Li Xiuchen was hurt by Luo Jianqing\u2019s sword-light and hit the ground, somewhat lost his wit \u2013 he didn\u2019t escape immediately but stayed where he fell down.When the captain stood in front of Li Xiuchen, he at last came to his sense and said with gritted teeth, \u201cThe voice! You are the guy from the hotel!\u201dLeaning a trunk, Luo Jianqing sniggered.He knew that Li Xiuchen could get away from this, so he didn\u2019t worry about him at all. Luo Jianqing won\u2019t let Li Xiuchen die here for he needed him to find opportunities in Wan Shou Peak for the following months, but\u2026\u2026He would still be glad to see Li Xiuchen encounter some scuffles.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They gathered up and pointed their weapons at Li Xiuchen, ready to slice him into pieces\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026then Li Xiuchen, surprisingly made a clever move, took out his disciple tablet.\u201cI\u2026\u2026I am an inner-door disciple of Tai Hua Mountain!\u201dThe crowd was shocked.Luo Jianiqng, who knew this would happen, sighed with resignation.The common cultivators exchanged looks. The Middle-stage Gold Core cultivator chuckled and said, \u201cI can see this is an effrontery guy who wanted to claim our prey and nearly had his way if that Nascent Soul Period cultivator didn\u2019t interfere. My brother, did you hear what this guy said?\u201d\u201cWell, brother, I heard nothing.\u201d\u201cDid anyone hear what he said?\u201dAll the other cultivators shook their heads, \u201cno.\u201dHeard their words, Li Xiuchen was stunned. He continued screaming \u201cI am an inner-door disciple of Tai Hua Mountain\u201d while he was getting a good thrashing. The crowd had no intention to kill him. They only tried their best to beat him up until Li Xiuchen couldn\u2019t bear any more. The coward used a precious white-jade tablet, fleeing away dozens of miles.The nineteen cultivators didn\u2019t try to catch him. They shrugged, went back to deal with the Golden Phoenix.However, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t see that coming. He was surprised that Li Xiuchen used the white-jade tablet this easily. What a waste! The rogue cultivators already knew he was from Tai Hua Mountain so that they definitely wouldn\u2019t kill him. They were irritated and wanted a little bit revenge, so they only flailed him, didn\u2019t show any life-threatening violence. Was Li Xiuchen really such a coward?There\u2019s no time to waste. Luo Jianqing speeded up to chase Li Xiuchen and caught him up several miles away.Resting and cursing Luo Jianqing \u2013 that mysterious Nascent Soul Period cultivator \u2013 with all the tarnation he knew, Li Xuichen was lying in a hidden cave when Luo Jianqing found him.Luo Jianqing heard his cursing and stayed there for several minutes. At last, he chuckled and flew away.\u2026\u2026and he came back with an enraged fourth-level Demon Beast. Face turned pale, Li Xiuchen was freaked out. He immediately fled away with wounded body. When he escaped the chase of that Demon Beast and finally had a break, another fourth-level Demon Beast rushed right toward him!\u201cWhy the hell I am pestered with such freaking bad luck these days!!!\u201dLi Xiuchen ran for his life while bollocking as usual.Li Xiuchen was forced to enter the deep Wan Shou Peak under the threat caused by the Demon Beasts which were guided to him by Luo Jianqing. Within three days, he climbed over three mountains, escaping while taking pills to preserve energy. The Demon Beasts didn\u2019t give up on hunting him down until he reached the inner area of the Wan Shou Peak.It would be nonsense if we say Li Xiuchen didn\u2019t have any doubt on the Demon Beasts were under someone\u2019s control.However, this was the first time he came to the Wan Shou Peak. He didn\u2019t have any enemy here except that Nascent Soul Period cultivator who called him \u201cnuisance\u201d, but why a high-level cultivator would make fun of him \u2013 a Qi Condensation Period beginner? This is absolutely not normal.Li Xiuchen couldn\u2019t figure out an answer.At this time, Luo Jianqing stopped teasing him.Seeking Immortality didn\u2019t describe Li Xiuchen\u2019s route like depicting a map. It only wrote that Li Xiuchen climbed over a mountain but didn\u2019t point out which one, so Luo Jianqing could only tail Li Xiuchen to look for chance.This time entering Wan Shou Peak, Li Xiuchen got three treasures that even impressed Luo Jianqing.The first one was the Beast Core of an Eighth-level Demon Beast.The second one was a Heaven-level broken sword.The third one was a Ninth Grade Godlike Pill which already transformed into human!Among these, Luo Jianqing could still get the former two if he wants, but the third one was an invaluable precious. No one in the word could refine a Ninth Grade Pill. The highest grade that Yu Qingzi could make was only Heaven-level Eighth Grade Pill, and there was no possibility for her to refine even a Huang-level Ninth Grade one.First Grade Pill was elementary. On the contrary, Ninth Grade Pill was the best.The level of pill was divided into four: Heaven, Earth, Xuan, Huang. Heaven-level Ninth Grade Godlike Pill only existed in legends. Once a pill like this was refined, the firmament would be rendered bizarre and the pill itself would immediately transform into human and become immortal!Its existence was only an ancient legend. This time, what Li Xiuche got was a Huang-level Ninth Grade Pill. Although it was the lowest level among the Ninth Grade, the pill still transformed into a suave scholar, sitting at the top of a no-name peak in the deep mountain, playing zither all day long.The pill had no Spiritual Power, so even Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t know there was a Ninth Grade Godlike Pill in the Billion Beasts Mountain. No Spiritual Power didn\u2019t mean harmless and weak. The pill used the power of the spiritual creatures and became a formidable existence in the Wan Shou Peak.When reading Seeking Immortality, Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t believe how come Li Xiuchen successfully claimed the pill.There was only one reason. That day, a Ninth-level Demon Beast who coveted the Godlike Pill for more than a hundred years provoked a fight. Though transformed into human, that scholar was, indeed, a pill. Anyone \u2013 not only the Demon Cultivators who can absorb others\u2019 Spiritual Power \u2013 could eat it and claim its invaluable healing power.It was a drastic fight.Li Xiuchen, by coincident, was on his way finding herbs for Mu Ruorong. Suddenly a fierce whirlwind carried him away. He woke up at the edge of the battlefield. He was landed at a perfect spot, wasn\u2019t hurt a single hair while all the other creatures were slaughtered by the two rivals\u2019 merciless attacks.Now the Demon Beast and Godlike Pill moved their battle field up to the sky, giving Li Xiuchen a chance to loot what\u2019s left on the ground.After collected all the valuable leftovers, Li Xiuchen rested aside to observe the battle which lasted for a whole day and a whole night.The Ninth-level Godlike Pill was gradually losing its ground, but the Demon Beast wasn\u2019t getting any benefit. Finally, the Godlike Pill ignited tremendous fire, burnt the Demon Beast badly, and transformed into a pill landed in the vast forest of the Wan Shou Peak.\u2026\u2026and Li Xiuchen could still find it?Yes, he was that damn lucky.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57 - I Must See Qing Jun! (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Xiuchen had little chance to win if confronting with a Ninth-Level Demon Beast, even if the latter one was badly injured, so he made a smart move, leaving the scene with no hesitation. He didn\u2019t even think about finding the Godlike Pill by chance, but stepped on a hard stone-like thing after he climbed over a mountain. Li Xiuchen looked down and found a glimmering pill!It was engraved with magnificent patterns. Even a non-cultivator could tell that this is definitely a Godlike Pill higher than Eighth Grade!There were countless mountains in the Wan Shou Peak range. Little did theGodlike Pill expect it would be found this quick. It only needed three days to recover thirty percent of his power so that he can transform again and escape, but Li Xiuchen caught it one hour after its landing.Taking benefit of its injury, Li Xiuchen erased the pill\u2019s consciousness and claimed it as his own.These were Luo Jianqing\u2019s main purposes of coming to the Billion Beasts Mountain.Ninth Grade Godlike Pill! A pill like this could provide tremendous advantages for its owner. The book showed that this was a healing pill which helped Li Xiuchen getting back to his best state many times immediately after absorbing a small amount of its Pill Power. \u2018If giving the pill to Xuan Lingzi\u2026\u2026will he fully recover from grievous injury caused by splitting Primordial Life several times?\u2019Watching Li Xiuchen acquire treasures one by one, Luo Jianqing tailed Li Xiuchen along the way.Sometimes Li Xiuchen would encounter life-threatening danger, but Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t worry about him at all, because this \u201cchosen one\u201d could always get away from danger and then obtain lots of treasures. Most of the rewards Li Xiuchen got didn\u2019t interest Luo Jianqing. Once there was something worth his attention, Luo Jianqing would rob it secretly while poor Li Xiuchen knew nothing about it.Just like that, they walked for another ten days.They were about to enter the inner range, but Li Xiuchen suddenly stopped moving forward but started lingering around. Didn\u2019t get irritated at all, Luo Jianqing sat down and started cultivation, practicing the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record while trying to understand the rules among the world.Li Xiuchen waited here for two days, then loathly kept moving. Wondered what he was waiting for, Luo Jianqing was confused a little. He got his answer very quickly, for Li Xiuchen encountered an alluring beauty who was lying aside because of badly wounds.Li Xiuchen\u2019s eyes were widened with delight, \u201cCultivator Mu! What happened?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026\u201d, Luo Jianqing was speechless.At night, beside the campfire.Mu Ruorong slowly opened her eyes and saw a familiar visage. She took out her scimitar by instinct but Li Xiuchen held her hand down as if they were already very close friends. \u201cCultivator Mu, I was walking along the road but suddenly saw you lying there, badly harmed. What happened?\u201dMu Ruorong\u2019s throat was burning. She looked at Li Xiuchen with a complicated gaze for a long time, finally whispered, \u201cI met a fifth-level Heaven Patterned Black Spider. It was stronger than me. I fainted out because its poison spilled on my body.\u201dLi Xiuchen knew the ins and outs very well. Now his eyes glimmered with joy, but he immediately changed his expression and said nervously, \u201ca fifth-level Heaven Patterned Black Spider? What can I do to help you?\u201dMu Ruorong didn\u2019t like Li Xiuchen since their encounter at the hotel. She was good at observing, and that was why she knew what Li Xiuchen was thinking by a glance. However, now she had no other choice except accepting his help. She could still move her hand, but pain came from other parts of her body which were splashed by poison and now started fester.These wounds must be dealt with in time! Nevertheless, Mu Ruorong couldn\u2019t move at all. She couldn\u2019t apply the medicine herself even if she had the cure.She was lying at nowhere in the inner range of the Wan Shou Peak. Rarely there would be people passing by.Mu Ruorong thought this would be her doom, she wasn\u2019t expecting anyone to come here and rescue her, but now Li Xiuchen was here. She was making a difficult choice between life and virtue. Tears were welling up in her eyes, because she recalled the words conveyed by that Nascent Soul Period cultivator in the hotel.\u201cIf you don\u2019t respect yourself, how can you ask others to respect you?\u201dAfter that, Mu Ruorong took down her revealing clothes and changed into normal dresses which a normal female cultivator would wear. She took conveniences of her beauty for ten years, but now she was already a Foundation Establishment Period cultivator, which means now she can protect herself and her body\u2026\u2026However, fortune didn\u2019t stand on her side. Mu Ruorong entered the inner range of Wan Shou Peak by mistake and was about to leave, but encountered a poisoned spider. Now she had to make a choice between life and virtue. Mouth dried, Mu Ruorong lowered her head. The bonfire nearby rendered her hair as burning fire color.After a long silence, Mu Ruorong said hoarsely, \u201cI have a bottle of medicine in my Interspatial Ring, which can delay the attack of the poison. Cultivator\u2026\u2026 Cultivator Li, could you please apply the medicine for me?\u201dLi Xiuchen answered with no hesitation. \u201cOf course!\u201dMu Ruorong shut her eyes, suppressing the animosity in her heart, \u201cthere are three wounds on my back, four on my both legs, one on my\u2026\u2026belly, and\u2026\u2026\u201d, she suddenly stopped, continued talking after taking a deep breath, \u201c\u2026\u2026and two on my chest\u201d.Li Xiuchen pretended to be shocked. \u201cCultivator Mu, how\u2026\u2026how can I apply medicine on your private parts?\u201dHe said it as if he was a righteous gentleman, but Mu Ruorong still kept her eyes closed as if she heard nothing. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, Cultivator Li. You are saving my life this time. If I am given a chance to survive, I will repay your kindness.\u201dLi Xiuchen still didn\u2019t say yes. \u201cBut, Cultivator Mu, you are a girl, not to mention the location of the wounds\u2026\u2026\u201dMu Ruorong said sternly, \u201cCultivator Li! Mu Ruorong thank you for your salvation!\u201dOut of Mu Ruorong\u2019s sights, Li Xiuchen sniggered. He refused for several times but agreed reluctantly at last. At first, he even suggested that he shall cover his eyes, but Mu Ruorong told him that he can\u2019t apply the medicine without seeing the wounds, so he put that suggestion aside.Beside the flickering flame, gorgeous female cultivator was lying on the ground and couldn\u2019t move, while the male cultivator next to her slowly reaching out his hands.When Li Xuchen\u2019s fingertips reached Mu Ruorong\u2019s clothes, the latter one shivered immediately but kept silent. Desire ignited in his eyes, Li Xiuchen undressed Mu Ruorong and saw her bright color bra. Wanly, Mu Ruorong gritted her teeth and closed her eyes as if doing so could stop what was about to happen.Naturally, she wouldn\u2019t know that Li Xiuchen swallowed his saliva and stretched out his hand aiming at her bra.At this moment, Luo Jianqing \u2013 who was standing in the shadow all the time \u2013 sighed with resignation.A sword-light charged at Li Xiuchen.Boom!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58 - I Must See Qing Jun! (3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Xiuchen was knocked down. Mu Ruorong opened her eyes in a shock and saw a bice figure approaching. That guy flicked his sleeve, moving Mu Ruorong\u2019s clothes back to cover her body.Eyes wide opened, Mu Ruorong stared at the man.With hair dancing along with the wind, his graceful bice robe was glimmering under the moonlight. He wore a silver mask which engraved with simple patterns, standing there as elegant as a lotus.Encounter the spider, nearly lost her life, almost got taken advantage of\u2026\u2026events were happening fast on Mu Ruorong, so, seeing the stranger approaching, the first reaction she made was becoming vigilant. However, when their sight met, she drowned into his eyes which had reluctance rippling inside. Although his visage was covered by the mask, she could still tell that there was a winsome face hidden beneath.Gorgeous but not dissolute. Dignified but not intimidating.She heard him saying, \u201cYou\u2019ve respected yourself, but there are still lots of things out of our control in this world. Today, you can\u2019t move, given that the poison must be dealt with as soon as possible otherwise you will die, so you have no choice but let him feast on your body. Whom, do you think, should be blamed?\u201dMu Ruorong said with uncertainty. \u201cThe spider?\u201dLuo Jianqing shook his head.\u201c\u2026\u2026me?\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u2026and no. Indeed, you should be blamed. You should be blamed for your incapability, for your weakness, for you cannot conquer fate, for you cannot become the strongest one able to protect yourself from insult. However, the one that truly should be blamed is destiny. What happened today, I think, is an opportunity disguised in unfortunate. It can boost your resolution, urge you to cultivate more so that your skills could be sharpened and soon reach a higher Period. If others do that to you, I might just stand by and watch, but this guy is different. I dislike him, really.\u201dMu Ruorong suddenly smiled. She knew that others don\u2019t have responsibility to save him. He didn\u2019t owe her anything. She couldn\u2019t blame him for that.\u201cTomorrow when he wakes up, you can tell him that a Third-level Demon Beast attacked you but was defeated. Then that beast left a pill behind by chance. You eat the pill and get recovered.\u201dLuo Jianqing flipped a pill in Mu Ruorong\u2019s hand.\u201cSir, I cannot move any parts of my body except my hand.\u201dNow Luo Jianqing finally found out Mu Ruorong has used her last bit of strength on brandishing the scimitar trying to drive Li Xiuchen away. Luo Jianqing let the pill fly into Mu Ruorong\u2019s mouth. The pill melted immediately, the power of pill was healing her body.One hour later, Mu Ruorong got back control of her body except her legs. She cupped her hands to pay respect to Luo Jianqing, \u201cthank you for your help!\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled, \u201cnever mind, it costs nothing for me to save you.\u201dMu Ruorong was stunned. In a blink, Luo Jianqing disappeared into the vast darkness, leaving behind some words, \u201cthe pill I give you was also in that guy\u2019s Interspatial Ring. Don\u2019t ask me why I know. It\u2019s your choice to decide trusting me or not.\u201dNext morning, Li Xiuchen slowly woke up. Mu Ruorong already put on her clothes, and was packing her stuff. Seeing Li Xiuchen come to his senses, Mu Ruorong told him what happened as Luo Jianqing instructed her. After that, she said, \u201cmost of my injuries were healed already. Cultivator Li, I decided to go back to the town. See you.\u201dLi Xiuchen was speechless, \u201cCultivator Mu, you\u2026\u2026\u201dMu Ruorong stood up and bowed down, \u201cCultivator Li, I must leave now, see you later.\u201dShe turned back without any hesitation. Li Xiuchen tried to reach her wrist but was threatened by her bleak scimitars.Under the sunlight, Mu Ruorong\u2019s beautiful face showed only coldness. She looked at Li Xiuchen and said this word by word, \u201cCultivator Li, I respect Tai Hua Mountain, but that doesn\u2019t mean I fear Tai Hua Mountain!\u201dHeard this, Li Xiuchen couldn\u2019t move anymore. Mu Ruorong walked away.Fist clenched, Li Xiuchen yelled at Mu Ruorong, \u201cCultivator Mu! I am Li Xiuchen, an inner door disciple of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Hao Ming Peak. You can drop by if you happen to visit Tai Hua Mountain!\u201d As long as they can meet again, there was still chance to win her heart!Li Xiuchen had no idea that this was not a matter of chance but a matter of loathing. However, heard his words, Mu Ruorong suddenly stopped and responded, \u201cSure, thanks for your generosity.\u201dLi Xiuchen was complacent. \u201cWell, looks like she still likes me. Of course, although we didn\u2019t do anything, I still saved her twice. Yep, don\u2019t panic, there\u2019s chance.\u201dWatched the whole thing happened, Luo Jianqing was shocked. He thought Mu Ruorong felt nothing towards Li Xiuchen except detest, then why did she accept his invite? Could it be\u2026\u2026the book\u2019s plots cannot be changed? No. If so, little sister must be reminded, can\u2019t let her step into danger anymore.Three days later, Li Xiuchen killed every Fourth-level Demon Beast he encountered and collected many treasures. He once even met two Fifth-level Demon Beasts. Fortunately, he got the instruments that Guang Lingzi gave him, so he wasn\u2019t harmed a hair.Luo Jianqing was counting down days, preparing for that drastic fight.At the same time, Mu Ruorong got back to Thirty-nine Town, taking a break. She went to the hotel where she confronted that five common cultivators. She ordered meal but kept holding the chopsticks in her hand in a daze, didn\u2019t eat at all. She lost in her mind.\u201cI have to respect myself.\u201d\u201cI have to cultivate more, being able to fight with destiny when it is unfair.\u201d\u201cI have to repay his kindness. I have to\u2026\u2026meet him again!\u201d\u201cHe seems to know a lot about Li Xiuchen, an acquaintance, maybe. Li Xiuchen is an inner-door disciple of Tai Hua Mountain. Then\u2026\u2026maybe\u2026\u2026maybe he\u2019s from Tai Hua Mountain as well! I can enter Tai Hua Mountain through Li Xiuchen, perhaps\u2026\u2026I can see him again this way!\u201dThinking about this, Mu Ruorong\u2019s gorgeous face flashed with a wisp of eagerness and shyness. This girl who spent many years slaughtering beasts in the Wan Shou Peak showed a rare sign of falling in love, making her visage more charming and beautiful.At this moment, in the Wan Shou Peak, Luo Jianqing suddenly coughed. \u201cWhy am I choking?\u201dLi Xiuchen who had no idea what happened was escaping for his life while screaming loudly.Disgusted, Luo Jianqing watched Li Xiuchen who was chased by a Fourth-level Demon Beast. He noticed the powerful instruments he was holding. Luo Jianqing really wanted to roll his eyes.Suddenly, a powerful whirlwind embraced them, covered everything into darkness!Luo Jianqing took pains to open his eyes, making his way toward Li Xiuchen. When he almost got to him, the wind took Li Xiuchen up to the sky along with Luo Jianqing who was standing nearby!This wind contained tremendous power in it. Among all the wind Luo Jianqing encountered in his life, only the Gang Wind from the Ninth Layer of the Liu Yan Valley was stronger than this one. Luo Jianqing tried his best to fight with vast Spiritual Power contained in the wind, but still lost his consciousness little by little. When he woke up, he heard a shrill laugh. \u201cHo Ha Ha Ha, Qing Jun, today is the day when you are the weakest in a hundred year. I will beat you into your original pill form and swallow you into my stomach!\u201dWhirlwind was summoned. Forest was shaking and waving as fragile grass.Luo Jianqing was still dizzy. He heard someone playing a bright dulcet song. The song stopped after a while. Along with a calm graceful manner, someone spoke, \u201cwhat is transform? What is origin? Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon, you are not whom I am waiting for, then why do you desire for something that not belongs to you?\u201d\u201cShut up! Qing Jun, today I will have you swallowed!\u201d\u201cWell, bring it on.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 59": "Chapter 59 - Waiting for Death Saplessly (1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe winding, wave-like mountains encircled the whole of the battlefield.Everything within the radius of hundred miles had been completely decimated in the duel between these two prominent figures, except for a few treasures along with other wreckages remained on the ground. Many monsters and cultivators were wiped out, traceless. Only the cores of those monsters above level seven and the bones of those cultivators above Gold Core remained.As such, this place surrounded by mountains became a death valley.Luo Jianqing had guessed that this was a very mysterious place in Wan Shou Peak, because no monster above level eight could enter Wan Shou Peak. However, there were a dead monster above level eight and a level-nine Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon.After he was awake, Luo Jianqing quickly took refuge behind a pile of sandstone and quietly observed the battle from a distance.The level-nine Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon was equal to a cultivator of Tribulation Passage Period and very powerful as well. Although Luo Jianqing had never seen any Godlike Pill of level nine before, after seeing their battle neck to neck, he could figure out that it\u2019s cultivation level was about Tribulation Passage PeriodAt the beginning, the flood dragon fought with the pill in the form of human, but after a while, it revealed its original form. It was a long golden flood dragon with two long horns and four claws, covered with flakes which were shining like the sun.When it swayed its long tail, it immediately caused a gust of whirlwind whizzing towards the pill.The pill was very calm. He put down his zither, placed it right before him and played the strings. With a slight move of his finger, a terrible sound wave suddenly thrusted towards the whirlwind, which exploded loudly the moment they crashed into each other. When the wave approached Luo Jianqing, it scared the hell out of him even though they are 20 miles apart.Luo Jianqing immediately took out the blue bamboo umbrella to cover his head.With the protection of the umbrella, Luo Jianqing let out a sound of relief and began to watch the horrible battle.The shape of the golden flood dragon was like a lightning, sometimes rushing into the sky and sometimes hovering in a circle. Every movement of the flood dragon was causing fierce wind which formed Gale Force. On the contrary, the pill wearing light color robe were playing the zither and sat there quietly. The zither seemed very simple-designed. He played in a casual way, but the sound was echoing in the air which stopped the drifting clouds and fierce wind outside.The rhythms repeated in a gentle way, however, the realm that the rhythms had conveyed enchanted Luo Jianqing deeply. As if he were reminded of that Xuan Lingzi was playing Yu Xiao Zither for him years ago. Back then, there was also some fantastic realm in his playing.Although Xuan Lingzi was far better than this pill in playing, Luo Jianqing could still perceive the elusive realm in pill\u2019s playing. It was a kind of realm that has seen through the world. When the zither was played in variation, it sounded like a weeping woman and a silent lament in turn.This was a sad song.With the song, the pill had a hard fight with the monster.When they flew to another battlefield far away in the sky, Luo Jianqing immediately came here to search for some treasures. He was faster than Li Xiuchen. The first thing he took away was the Core of level-eight monster, then he also took the Heaven Level Sword.After having those two things, Luo Jianqing went on searching carefully.Magic treasure of Earth Level? Mine! Corpse of level-seven monster? Mine!Anything of value had been taken away.After a while, the whole field was like a wild goose which was plucked off all the feathers. Except some worthless stones and branches, the rest were all tucked into the interspatial ring of Luo Jianqing.Looking at this dead ground, Luo Jianqing sighed and then burned the body of the dead cultivator of Nascent Soul, together with the other three of Golden Core cultivators. After that, he took away their ashes as he planned to set an anonymous tombstone for them somewhere else after he left.Then, for the bodies of those strange monsters, Luo Jianqing chose a simple way to deal with them.With a wave of hand, everything was burned!With everything done, Luo Jianqing began to look around for Li Xiuchen. After a quarter of an hour, he found Li lying unconsciously under a huge stone. The moment he saw Li Xiuchen, he twitched his lips out of jealousy because Li was so lucky to be safe.He and Li Xiuchen were both blown here by a gust of wind. He was dropped on the ground casually. Fortunately, he woke up in time, otherwise he might be directly killed in the battle between the monster and the pill. What about Li Xiuchen? He was sleeping under a thousand years old Zhong Qi Stone!Zhong Qi Stone was a kind of spiritual stone and a superior material for refining. It featured for its concealment and hardness, the so-called turtle shell. It was hard to find it even for an alchemist, because there was no other special feature on its appearance, except for the hardness. It seemed like any normal stones you could find. Because under the cover of this stone, Li Xiuchen did not get killed by the aftermath of the battle this time, otherwise Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t be able to find it.Seeing such a huge stone, Luo Jianqing gradually put on a smile on his face.Giving this stone to the sixth brother for refining would be perfect.Li Xiuchen, who was still asleep, turned over and seemed to agree with him.This stone could temporarily protect Li Xiuchen from the harm after all, so Luo Jianqing did not take it away immediately. He hid away and kept an eye on Li Xiuchen. At this moment, Luo Jianqing could hardly see the fighting in the sky, but he still waited patiently, because he knew that without Li Xiuchen, he could never find the pill.As time went by, Luo Jianqing was getting stiffened and paid close attention all the time.The sun was setting in the west, the moon was rising.Li Xiuchen finally woke up when the sun was setting in the west. He firstly got stunned, then he happily rushed out of the safe area under the protection of Zhong Qi Stone, and turned around to look at the battlefield around. Then \u2026 dumbfounded.\u201cWTF?! What is going on? Is it burned here? How could it be scorched like this?\u201dLooking at this desolate land, Li Xiuchen was totally struck dumb. After a quarter of an hour, he immediately stepped forward to search. Obviously, just like what you could see, there was nothing valuable, not to mention any magic treasures!Li Xiuchen clenched his teeth in anger: \u201cWhat happened? Is that\u2026 I have been fainted for a long while, so the monster and the pill ruined the battlefield once again and destroyed everything?!\u201dUpon hearing that, Luo Jianqing laughed in his heart.Yes, this was the reason why he destroyed the battlefield. Before that, he had known that Li Xiuchen seemed to know the contents of the book Seeking Immortal, so when Li woke up, he would definitely go to find the so-called treasures.There should be a reason that he couldn\u2019t find anything, right?Li Xiuchen could figure out that there was something wrong, so Luo Jianqing might expose himself.So, if he ruined everything on this place, Li could find nothing and never knew what happened here.Luo Jianqing did not know how Li Xiuchen could guess it right. But upon hearing his explanation, he felt it reasonable as well.In the book, it said that Li Xiuchen was the disciple of Xuan Lingzi and instructed by him. Although he was at level nine of Qi Refining, he was much better than now.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 60": "Chapter 60 - Waiting for Death Saplessly (2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBack then in his previous life, Luo Jianqing knew that his junior brother had been far better than he was now as he had the power to defeat any middle-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator in an instant. Also, he looked much more mature back then. One wondered if it was because he had stayed in Yu Xiao Peak for too long. The way he carried himself felt a bit like that calm and reserved Xuan Lingzi.However, knowing his strength now, there was a high possibility that Li Xiuchen would fall into a coma for a long while. So, it was very likely that these treasures would be ruined by this battle.Feeling aggrieved, Li Xiuchen let out a long sigh, \u201cWhat the heck?\u201dThe moment he finished his words, the golden light and the silver light started glistening in turns up in the sky while a rush of zither sound broke the air. Then there was this extremely horrible spiritual power rushing out, and with it came a strong aroma of spiritual pills.Seeing that, a beam of light flashed through Li Xiuchen\u2019s eyes and then he quickly hid under the Zhong Qi Stone. Not far away from him, Luo Jianqing also held his breath and kept his eyes focused on the battlefield.Bang!Bang!The Pill was the first to fall down from the sky and it crushed down on the ground hard, causing a crack and the clumsy flood dragon also fell on the ground after him. It felt like an earthquake when it landed on the ground and Luo Jianqing was apparently shocked by that. However, Li Xiuchen, not far away from him, was still observing the situation with a lively interest.The flood dragon turned into a bald man after it landed. He looked like a vulgar man with fat face, and his clothes was already soaking wet with blood. Nonetheless, he stepped forward with an excited look on his face, knowing that he had backed the Pill to the wall and it\u2019s his best chance to take the medicine now!On the ground, the elegant suave scholar in blue robe raised his hand to wipe off the cyan liquid at the corner of his mouth.The flood dragon had already flown to his side, yet the man simply stood up casually and flicked away the dust on his sleeve as if nothing had happened. When he was tidying himself up, the flood dragon stopped his attack and waited for a while. Then the dragon said, \u201cQing Jun, we have known each other for a hundred years and all this time we have been fighting with each other. However, I want to break through Earth Level and became the Demon Exalt, so I have to eat you. That\u2019s my only chance.\u201d The man looked up at the flood dragon and said, \u201cAll men must die. It\u2019d either me or you today. You don\u2019t need to say anything. As a Pill, my fate has been written long ago, but you are not the one I\u2019m waiting for, so I can\u2019t help you with your cultivation.\u201dThe bald man laughed and said: \u201cThen it is going to be a fight!\u201dThe man in robe withdrew his zither and replied, \u201cThen let\u2019s fight!\u201dAfter finishing those words, they gathered their powers around and got ready to fight. An illusory flood dragon appeared behind the bald, big man while a misty cyan flower appeared on the top of the elegant suave scholar. After the appearance of these illusions, the violent and strong wind got stagnant. Luo Jianqing kept a close eye on the scene. Unfortunately, the flower was too weak to show what was really happening, which bummed Luo Jianqing out.Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon launched the first attack and the Pill also pushed the cyan flower forward.The two clashed, making roaring sound in the sky. The Pill was weak at that point and soon it started to show signs of defeat. But suddenly, the handsome scholar whispered, \u201cYou are not the one I\u2019m waiting for.\u201d Then the cyan flower was suddenly lit up with golden fire.\u201cYou used the pill fire!\u201dBang!The illusion of the flood dragon instantly disappeared, while the bald man spat out a mouthful of blood and fell on the ground. Over at the other side, the man looked as pale as a piece of white paper with golden fire burning on his body. After a short while he suddenly turned into a small pill and flew to the east.Upon seeing that, Li Xiuchen excitedly widened his eyes and quickly went after it. After Li Xiuchen was gone, Luo Jianqing took the huge Zhong Qi Stone into his interspatial ring, and then went to catch up with him.Fast as Li Xiuchen was, he was simply no match for the pill when it came to speed. After a while, he lost the track of the pill, but he kept going forward with Luo Jianqing hot on his tail.They spent half an hour chasing the pill in this way.Feeling frustrated, Li Xiuchen kept looking around, but in the end he had no choice but to keep going forward. Another half an hour passed and Li Xiuchen was passing by a hillside. He seemingly stepped on something hard and suddenly became extremely excited and stooped down to check the ground under his feet.All of a sudden, a dazzling blue light lit up the whole hillside.\u201cGot it\u2026 ahhhhhhh!\u201dLuo Jianqing came out from behind the huge stone nearby and he kicked the then stunned Li Xichen away, who immediately rolled down the hillside.However, no sooner had Luo Jianqing taken out the pill when he heard the roaring thunder in the sky, and after a short while, many lightnings came straight down one by one and struck the grounds near Luo Jianqing.If Luo Jianqing moved to the left, the lightning would strike on the right; if Luo Jianqing moved forward, the lightning would strike behind him. The Heaven seemed like a blind man. It always missed its target as if it couldn\u2019t find out where he was.Luo Jianqing had known a thing or two about this phenomenon. However, now that he saw it happen with his own eyes, he was still a bit shocked.\u2018Nine Heavenly Seizure Record was such an almighty book. It allowed to me get rid of the Heaven Way.\u2019After eighteen thunderbolts, the heavy cloud in the sky gradually dissipated. It seemed like that the Heaven Way thought there was no need to fight any more, so it gave up and let Luo Jianqing go. Honestly speaking, if the Heaven Way had determined to kill Luo Jianqing, he would be dead already. If it struck a rain of thunderbolts, Luo Jianqing would have nowhere to run.But at that moment, killing Luo didn\u2019t seem like a worthwhile thing to do.Seeing the thunderclouds dissipated, Luo Jianqing put on a casual smile and lowered his head to take the pill out from the earth. But the moment he got the pill, bang! A magnificent pill power rushed into his meridians from his palm. This healing pill was actually attacking him!\u201cWrong!\u201dLuo Jianqing immediately transferred his spiritual power to resist it.However, this pill power was so overwhelming that it smashed into Luo\u2019s meridians with such magnificent power that seemed to devour his spiritual power. Seeing that his power was swallowed, Luo Jianqing slightly closed his eyes and subconsciously worked up the elusive power in his body which belonged to the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record.When the elusive power met with the pill power in his body, the latter was suddenly shocked, and it tried to escape out of his body. However, the elusive power wouldn\u2019t let it go. Like a long snake, the power rushed out of his body and wrapped the little pill up.The pill resisted slightly in vibration.Luo had been soaked in sweat and his face was all pale. He let out a sigh of relief. To his surprise, an elegant voice suddenly arose from the hillside, \u201cYou are not the person I am waiting for, either. Don\u2019t be so greedy.\u201d.Luo was dead beat, but with the last bit of strength he let out a sneer, \u201cThe most capable man takes the treasure. I might not be the one you are waiting for, nor do I know who the right one is, but you are now firmly in my hand and it won\u2019t take me much energy to gulp you down.The Pill smiled, \u201cThen why didn\u2019t you just erase my consciousness and eat me back then?\u201dLuo was obviously not expecting this and replied, \u201cI will do it now.\u201dThe Pill let out a gentle smile and said matter-of-factly, \u201cIt\u2019s too late.\u201dBoom!A rush of power charged from behind Luo and his body started shaking like crazy. He subconsciously took out a blue bamboo umbrella from the interspatial ring and deployed it. The moment he open that umbrella, the power came smashing down on it, and broke six of its ribs. Only then did he manage to stop that onslaught.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The smell you gave off deliberately has led it to you!\u201dThe next thing he knew, the sword was already out of its sheath.\u201cOne Sword Turns Nine-Petaled Lotus!\u201dIn an instant, the sword matrix kept spinning and with an ancient and devoid smell the sword turned into a blue lotus which charged forward towards the dragon. However, the flood dragon simply dismissed it with a wave of his claw and as the lotus broke up, Luo Jianqing took two steps back with bloodLuo put the pill into the interspatial ring and glared at the attacker with sword in hand.\u201cFor a Nascent-Soul stage cultivator, to die in my hand is your honor.\u201d\u201cDie, you evil creature!\u201dLuo exhausted all the skills he had learnt in the past and kept hiding beneath the claw of the dragon. However, for all the treasures he used along with the skill he was only meant to be using when he reached the Out-of-body Period described in True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record, he ended up failing at every turn and the chance of winning looked very slim.At that point, the flood dragon had already recovered a bit. He shattered Luo\u2019s blue umbrella into pieces and looked at the mortally wounded Human Cultivator who was in the same spot as it had been minutes ago with a sneer, \u201cI will kill you and take that pill out of the interspatial ring. You can go join Qing Jun in hell!\u201dAs soon as it finished those words, the flood dragon swung its gigantic tail, sending a wave of storming wind which charged at Luo like a sharp knife.The dragon laughed as it watched what was happening in front of him. However, the man he despised the most suddenly took out a golden bead. The minute the flood dragon noticed that bead, it stopped laughing and started running away. Years of cultivation had reinforced his ability for smelling danger. But it was too late, Luo had already tossed that bead away.The bead seemed ordinary and there was nothing extraordinary about it.But as the bead came closer, the dragon\u2019s got fear written all over its face. It ran away with its utmost speed, it could not stop the bead from crashing into its belly, and then\u2026Boommmm!For a moment, the whole world was crumbling.The dazzling golden light was all that was visible in the world and as the golden bead exploded, the energy it emitted formed a plain-looking golden lotus in the sky and immediately it came crashing down on the flood dragon, piercing it in the process and slowly vanished into thin air.Time seemed to have stopped at that moment and people in the valley all saw this beam of golden light.The elders sent by various sects to inspect all came out to see this golden light with horrified look on their faces.And the monsters even above level seven were all in shock and they kept fleeing in disorder.One wondered what horrible strength the golden light carried as its mere appearance was enough to strike everyone dumb.That was 70% of the power of the only Immortal-Stage cultivator in the world, Xuan Lingzi.Such was the power of a supreme like him, and it was enough to kill a level nine monster!It felt like ages for such a short time, and when the golden light faded, Luo was already trembling with his mortally wounded body and he mustered what little strength he had left and fled the scene as quick as possible.He didn\u2019t want people to know that he was there. Most importantly, he feared that this attack wouldn\u2019t be enough to kill that flood dragon!Within a blink of an eye, Luo had been miles away. After 45 minutes, he heard an agonizing roar from behind. The deafening sound was coming from the infuriated flood dragon, \u201cHuman! You\u2019ve ruined my chance at becoming the Demon Exalt and I am damned to remain forever at level eight! I must kill you! You are a dead man!!!\u201dThe flood dragon unleashed its ultimate revival skill which brought it back to life.Like that phoenix, the flood dragon was a distant relative of the orthodox dragon family. But unlike the legitimate members, it was born with level six and had a chance at returning to the dragon family. However, once it used its revival skill, it forever renounced its claim to become a true dragon.That said, a level eight dragon was like an out-of-body human cultivator. Thought severely wounded, it could still easily kill that equally wounded Luo with one finger.The enraged flood dragon was in no mood to ponder what background Luo had to be able to possess that kind of treasure. It had only one thought in mind, and that was to kill Luo.The flood dragon was way faster than Luo and in a few seconds it managed to catch up with Luo. It unleashed one strike and Luo was immediately sent crashing into a mountain wall with blood puking out of his mouth.At that moment, the eyes of Luo had been covered with blood. He slowly raised his head, only to see that the monster was bearing down on him with heavy steps. Its furious look made Luo nervous yet there was no second golden bead available that could save him.Luo\u2019s breath seemed slowed and the whizzing wind seemed to have stopped as well.Looking at the world through his blood-stained eyes, Luo could hear his own heart beating like crazy. It had never occurred to him that his heart could beat so fast at a moment such as this. Now that he thought about it, he had experienced the same ponding heart beats when he was lying in his own pool of blood after being beaten by Xuan Lingzi.Back then, he had wondered what Xuan\u2019s face would look like if he had died in front of him. But now, there were only bitterness and hatred in his heart and he didn\u2019t want to die any more. He wanted to live and force that man to reveal his true feelings to himself. He wanted to have him and\u2026bring this pill back to him\uff01With that thought in mind, he suddenly felt a gush of mild power and he started performing the Nine Heavenly Seizure Record.Luo raised his finger with great difficulty and a small wave of sword energy started concentrating on the tip of his finger. Wave upon wave of power started to wrap this energy up like numerous silk worm cocoons. Then, this wave of energy was projected towards the flood dragon, only to be swept aside by its tail.Luo coughed out a mouthful of blood and let out a bitter smile, patiently waiting for his imminent death.He was no Li Xiuchen who was born with luck, and that was why when he got the pill, he ran into the thunder and the dragon.Luo closed his eyes, and that person\u2019s silhouette was the first thing that emerged in his mind. From their first encounter to the decades-long companionship that followed, the relationship between the two had changed. Now, Luo couldn\u2019t take his eyes off that person for even one second and he missed that person\u2019s warm hug. He wanted that person to think nothing but him.All those things he wanted sounded like fantasy words right now. But at least he got to tell that person how he felt about him and he knew that he really liked him. That should be enough for him\u2026\u201cDie, human!\u201dFerocious energy charged towards Luo, and at the moment, Luo suddenly heard some tinkling sounds. Those sounds had always been around and it was not until this critical moment that he only managed to hear them.Suddenly, Luo heard someone yelling, \u201cLuo Jianqing, don\u2019t die on me!\u201dLuo immediately opened his eyes and saw a scarlet figure came swooping in from above. His eyes contracted and exclaimed, \u201cMo Qiu!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

A bloody scourge formed out of vast amount of Spiritual Power and black Fiend Power which almost condensed into a touchable matter. The scourge broke the boundary, twined with Heaven Live Flood Dragon\u2019s claw which was about to grab Luo Jianqing\u2019s shoulder, and pulled back the Demon Beast.\u201cWho is it!\u201dUnder the scorching sun, a scarlet figure was stepping on Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon\u2019s head. He was convoluted by snake-like dreadful Fiend Power which \u2013 as if it was burning in the air \u2013 transformed into countless whips and continuously scourged the Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon whose head was under Mo Qiu\u2019s foot.The vixen-like Fiend Cultivator sneered, \u201cYou mutt, you\u2019re not worthy enough to know my name. Go to hell!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you! I\u2019m gonna kill you!\u201dSo the battle began.Boom! Boom! Bomm!Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t believe what he saw. Though the Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon was impaired and dropped to Eighth-level, it was still a matching opponent for a Body-Fusion-Period Human Cultivator. While Mo Qiu was just a\u2026\u2026Eyes wide opened, Luo Jianqing unbelievably stared at the man fighting the Flood Dragon.\u201cThe late stage of Nascent Soul Period!\u201dOne was the late stage of Nascent Soul Period; the other was badly-injured Body Fusion Period; the difference in cultivation was two whole Period!Fiend Cultivators were naturally the strongest among the cultivators in the same Period. Mo Qiu was the only Fiend Cultivator Luo Jianqing knew in this life, but Luo Jianiqng himself had become a Fiend Cultivator in his last life. That was why he knew how powerful a Fiend Cultivator could be \u2013 far more powerful than others imagined.Besides, this was Mo Qiu.The scourge that Mo Qiu was using was not the one he used when they first met at the hotel. This scourge was engraved with complicated patterns, and every wisp of it was seeping Fiend Power, intimidating already just by looking at it. When the scourge whipped on Heaven Live Flood Dragon\u2019s body, it moaned in suffer for its skin \u2013 though hard like iron \u2013 was still broken and left a gash.The black Flood Dragon was flying up and down, constantly stretching his body, while Mo Qiu was watching it calmly, whipping it at the right time, using his dreadful Fiend Power and Spiritual Power to force Flood Dragon keep running for its life.However, Mo Qiu didn\u2019t let it go easily.This was an unforgettable scene for anyone who had seen it.A Nascent Soul Period Cultivator beat an Eighth-level Demon Beast so that the latter one can do nothing but escape!\u201cYou win! I lost! You\u2019re a Fiend Cultivator, and a Nascent Period one. You don\u2019t want others to know that you\u2019ve came to the continent, right? Let me go, I won\u2019t tell anybody!\u201dMo Qiu took back his blood-dripping scourge and stamped on Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon\u2019s head, then \u201cboom\u201d, the giant Flood Dragon was on the ground, created a pit around him.The Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon was about to lift his head and was trampled by Mo Qiu again.Mo Qiu sneered, \u201care you threatening me?\u201dCursing words were just at his tip of tongue, but Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon forced himself swallowed them back.Nevertheless, Mo Qiu didn\u2019t give him another chance to beg for pardon. Eyes narrowed, he said, \u201cif you really want to threaten me, you\u2019d better ask your four Demon Exalts come here, I\u2019ll teach you guys a lesson!\u201dNext moment\u2026\u2026Boom!The black patterns on the scarlet scourge started glittering, dancing in the air, and finally formed a sharp silver spear. At the moment the spear emerged, tremendous Fiend Power suppressed Luo Jianqing. He nearly lost his ability to breath. Although he couldn\u2019t even see Mo Qiu and Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon\u2019s scuffle, he still felt a wisp of familiar suppression.He had the exact same feeling when he hurled Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Spiritual Bead before. Seventy percent of a Deity Transformation Period Cultivator\u2019s attack was overwhelming enough to turn the sky and the earth upside down, and made the Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon one step closer to death. If not saved by its gifted skill, it would be a dead corpus by now.The diabolic sense on Mo Qiu\u2019s scourge only maintained for a gleam and immediately dispersed in the air. Luo Jianqing found it weird, but didn\u2019t think too much.The black spear stabbed into Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon\u2019s head and forced the Demon Beast burst out a painful groan. It hung on for a while. The spear kept swirling inside its skull so that its brain was torn asunder. Finally, the moribund Flood Dragon let out its last breath.Mo Qiu collected his scourge into the Interspatial Ring. He left the corpus untouched, walking straight toward the cliff. Mo Qiu looked down, gazing at Luo Jianqing who was wounded very badly, suddenly let out a snigger, \u201cLuo Jianqing, did I just save your life? Once more? You owe me something now, don\u2019t you? How would you like to repay me?\u201dHad no strength left in him at all, Luo Jianqing leaned on the cliff, lifted his gaze and smiled, \u201cyou are really good at saying something opposite with what you actually mean\u2026\u2026cough, cough\u2026\u2026\u201dThe cultivator in bice coughed out lots of blood. His face already covered by the scarlet liquid.Seeing this, Mo Qiu\u2019s eyes narrowed. He stretched out hand about to help Luo Jianqing to get up, but stopped before he reached him. Mo Qiu said emotionlessly, \u201cwhatever, I am a tender-hearted guy who can\u2019t bear watching these kind of bastard bully a beauty like you. Alright, I\u2019m gonna go collect the treasures and Beast Core, you stay here and have a rest\u2026\u2026hey!\u201dMo Qiu quickly got to Luo Jianqing\u2019s side, dispersing Spiritual Power to probe his vines.Mouth twitched, Mo Qiu sighed and thought, \u201cThis is how Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Master protects his disciple? No life-saving cast, no high-level instrument\u2026\u2026this is how Xuan Lingzi let you out to face danger? That jerk\u2026\u2026\u201dReluctantly, Mo Qiu carried Luo Jianqing on his back. He was going to hold him in his arms but changed his mind when he saw Luo Jianqing\u2019s face colored with blood and dirt. Looking at Luo Jianqing\u2019s miserable visage, Mo Qiu decided to put Luo Jianqing on his back so that this untidy cultivator could get out of his sight.Taking another blood scourge out of his Interspatial Ring, Mo Qiu twirled his wrist. The Blood Shadow Scourge pierced Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon\u2019s skull and took out a golden Beast Core.This was a core which belonged to a Demon Beast who once reached Ninth-level! An invaluable precious in the whole world! Nonetheless, Mo Qiu only cast a glance at it, then started absorbing the Spiritual Power from the Beast Core to recover from injury while hurried his way.When seeing Luo Jianqing faint out, though Mo Qiu was a little bit worried, he was more relieved instead.Assured Luo Jianqing\u2019s condition was not that bad, Mo Qiu sighed with relief. Face pale white, he spat out a mouthful blood. He carried Luo Jianiqng on his back and left the battlefield. \u201cLuckily, I was wandering in Billion Beasts Mountain. Luckily, the Devil-sounded Bell rang. Tell me, huh, why I am always in bad luck every time I met you? If I encountered this ninth-level beast in the past, I could kill it by just staring at it, but now I have to drain all of my Spiritual Power\u2026\u2026is it possible that I owed you this in our last life?\u201dAs if replying Mo Qiu, Luo Jianqing\u2019s head hanged low, leaning on his shoulder.Mo Qiu looked back and was startled. Then he immediately shoved Luo Jianqing\u2019s head aside, \u201coh my god, it\u2019s too ugly. This shouldn\u2019t happen to this little beauty\u2026\u2026\u201dWhen Luo Jianqing woke up, what he saw was a flame kindling in darkness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(2)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayWearing scarlet from head to toe, Mo Qiu was sitting beside the bonfire, roasting meat. The oil seeping out was glittering, dripping down along the succulent meat. Though the lower layer was slightly overcooked, even Luo Jianqing who already practiced Bigu for years was attracted by its appetizing aroma and couldn\u2019t help butswallow a mouthful of saliva.Intrigued, Mo Qiu looked at him. \u201cYou awake?\u201dUsed up all the strength he had now, Luo Jianqing sat up and said boldly, \u201cwell, you knew that by just a glance\u201d.Mo Qiu widened his eyes, \u201chey! Luo Jianqing, I SAVED you. Is this the attitude you decided to use towards your saver?\u201dDidn\u2019t get irritated, Luo Jianqing smiled and lowered his head with respect, \u201cthank you, Mo Qiu.\u201dStunned by Luo Jianqing\u2019s quick-changing attitude, Mo Qiu suddenly didn\u2019t know what to do. They stared at each other for a while. Finally, Mo Qiu flicked his sleeve, moved his eyes away unnoticeably, \u201cyou\u2026\u2026you\u2019d better wash your face right now. I can\u2019t bear it anymore.\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWashed off all the dirt and mud, Luo Jianqing returned to the cave. He had no idea where they were, and was surprised that Mo Qiu had found this cave with heaps of treasures pile up like hills in it. They were sitting in front of the treasures, having dinner.Luo Jianqing said curiously, \u201cis this your secret treasury cave?\u201dMo Qiu shook his head, \u201cyou fainted out for days. I gave you pills but you still didn\u2019t wake up. Several days ago, after I killed that beast, I carried you on my back and left that area to avoid encounter with those so-called righteous human cultivators. I met a very hospitable snake on the way, who gave us its own cave and its treasures.\u201dLuo Jianqing sensed something went wrong, \u201cwhere is that snake\u2026\u2026beast?\u201dMo Qiu smiled winsomely, \u201coh, it was too hospitable. The snake roasted itself to be our food just in case we get hungry.\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dWho would believe this bullshit!?They had a chat for a while, and from which Luo Jianqing found out that it was truly a coincidence that Mo Qiu was at Billion Beast Mountain as well. Reached the later stage of Nascent Soul Period, Mo Qiu met the bottleneck, so he came to the Billion Beast Mountain seeking for opportunities and sharpening his skills.Mo Qiu heard the ring of Devil-sounded Bell at the moment Luo Jianqing was discovered by that Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon. He knew Luo Jianqing was in danger. The Devil-sounded Bell informed him the location as well, so he came as soon as possible.According to what Mo Qiu told Luo Jianqing, he wasn\u2019t in a hurry at all, wandered on the road and discovered him so came to check him out.Nonetheless, Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t believe less on what Mo Qiu said. They spent three years together in the Liu Yan Valley. He knew Mo Qiu so well that he could tell \u2013 from the speed \u2013 that Mo Qiu was flying as fast as possible to come and help him. Luo Jianqing knew his friend of life and death was a person who always says things opposite with what he was thinking.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t insist. He stared at Mo Qiu after they finished their dinner, kept the words in his mouth.Seeing this, Mo Qiu sniggered, \u201cjust say what you want. I hate it when people faltering. Luo Jianqing, when did you learn this? Let me guess, you want to ask me how come I reached the late-stage of Nascent Soul Period within two years?\u201dHesitated awhile, Luo Jianqing nodded his head lightly.Mo Qiu shrugged, \u201cbecause I\u2019m a genius\u201d.Luo Jianqing lifted one eyebrow, \u201ca genius with low-grade Spiritual Bones?\u201dStood up immediately, Mo Qiu yelled at Luo Jianqing, \u201chey! You ungrateful bastard!\u201dSmiling, Luo Jianqing dragged him to sit down. \u201cCome on, stop bragging. Seriously, I\u2019m curious about what you\u2019ve been through these two years\u201d.Disgruntled, Mo Qiu sat down. He asked Luo Jianqing after biting off a mouthful of juicy meat, \u201cyou suspect that I killed people and absorbed their Spiritual Power?\u201dLuo Jianqing shook his head with no hesitation, \u201cI trust you\u201d.Mo Qiu was surprised by his reaction. He looked at Luo Jianqing with complicated gaze, and said after a long silence, \u201cbut what if I DID kill people? I\u2019d been befalling massacre everywhere I go. I slaughtered countless cultivators the way butchers slaughtered sheep and cattle. Blood dyed my clothes scarlet as they are now. I killed everyone who stood in my way, mercilessly.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s smile slowly disappeared, for he felt that he couldn\u2019t figure out whether Mo Qiu was joking or not.They looked at each other in silence. Mo Qiu suddenly moved away his eyes and said, \u201cI was joking\u201d.\u201cI know.\u201d Luo Jianqing responded, \u201cif\u2026\u2026what you said is true, one day when we meet on the battlefield, I will definitely kill you, but, other than this, Mo Qiu, you are, and always will be, my friend of life and death\u201d.Mo Qiu clenched his fist. He tossed half of the meat into the bonfire and let out a laugh, \u201cyou don\u2019t believe my words, yet you are trying to mock me. I am a genius, really, Mo Qiu never killed anyone. I told you before. You know, being a Fiend Cultivator isn\u2019t that easy. The more lives we took away, the more difficult it was to reach higher level of cultivation\u201d.Luo Jianqing nodded, \u201cI know. My Master told me this before: that the Fiend Exalt killed too many people so he stuck at late-stage of Da Sheng Period for thousands of years, couldn\u2019t find a way to reach a higher level. Master said that this might be the ceiling for the Fiend Exalt. It\u2019s good for you not to follow his mistake.\u201dMo Qiu\u2019s smile froze, then said with weird voice, \u201cwhatever, I\u2019m just smarter than you\u201d.Luo Jianqing took a gleam at him, \u201cyeah, yeah, your cultivation is higher than me b two small Periods\u201d.Mo Qiu mocked him, \u201chey, you want a fight? Who saved you this time, huh?\u201dSpeechless, Luo Jianqing nodded, and said in a serious tone, \u201cit\u2019s you. Cultivator Mo, thank you for saving my life!\u201dMo Qiu waved his hand, \u201cthat\u2019s not necessary\u201d.They chatted, Luo Jianqing said that he\u2019s almost fully recovered. After reassured they were safe and there wasn\u2019t any threat approaching, hesitated for a while, Luo Jianqing told Mo Qiu about the Godlike Pill.Heard things about the Ninth-grade Pill, Mo Qiu was shocked, but after listening carefully to Luo Jianqing\u2019s description, he believed the Ninth-grade Pill which was in the Interspatial Ring had already recovered some strength. The power of that pill was equal to a Tribulation Passage Period cultivator. If it found back its full strength, they stood no chance to win.They discussed for a solution. Luo Jianqing offered instruments, while Mo Qiu offered power, together, they casted a Soul Confinement Array.They spent ten days arranging this complicated high-level array. Luo Jianqing was a complete handyman. Mo Qiu was the one who knew the cast and performing the spells. After they set the array, they took a rest to cultivate their Spiritual Power.They made an eye contact, then Luo Jianqing released the pill from its Interspatial Ring.The moment that pill came out of the Interspatial Ring, delighting pill aura immediately embraced them.Luo Jianqing said in a low voice, \u201cconfine!\u201dSuddenly, the Soul Confinement Array was dispersing splendid light. The aura was restricted in the array, didn\u2019t leak out a wisp. A small bice pill was floating at the center of the array, didn\u2019t move as if it fell into deep sleep.Mo Qiu was inspecting it, while Luo Jianqing stepped forward and said, \u201csir, why are you hiding yourself?\u201dSilence, for a long time.Luo Jianqing smiled, \u201cif this is your response, then don\u2019t blame me for erasing your consciousness!\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s fingers started dancing in the air as if sealing the hand sign, then the next moment he heard a reluctant sigh. A misty figure flew out from the pill. Its body wasn\u2019t that firm as Luo Jianqing first saw him in the mountain, already dim and nearly indiscernible. Carrying a simple zither behind its back, the Godlike Pill looked at Luo Jianqing with complicated gaze.The pill ignored Mo Qiu completely, staring only at Luo Jianqing.This was the first time Luo Jianqing really took a look at this Godlike Pill.It turned out to be a comely scholar. One could not say he was stunningly handsome, but surely he had a winsome face. His gaze was like a cup of tea \u2013 dispersing light aura that enchanting everyone. Gaze intertwined in the air, Luo Jianqing suddenly felt himself drown into a weird zone, slowly lost his mind.Then he heard Mo Qiu\u2019s call, \u201cLuo Jianqing, wake up!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Jianqing was possessed until he heard Mo Qiu\u2019s shout.Now, there\u2019s no need to say anything. Luo Jianqing drew out his Floating Frost Sword, looking at the pill with killing intent ignited in his eyes, and said, \u201csir, I respect you for you are \u2013\u2013 the one and only Ninth-grade Godlike Pill, and by that reason I didn\u2019t erase your consciousness immediately. However, that doesn\u2019t mean you can make fool of me! Treasure would always belong to someone who\u2019s capable to own it. Don\u2019t blame me for the things I\u2019m going to do now!\u201dFinished his sentence, Luo Jianqing unsheathed his sword, about to erase the pill\u2019s consciousness while it wasn\u2019t fully recovered.Surprisingly, the pill-transformed scholar mumbled, \u201cyou are not him. You are not whom I am waiting for.\u201dHolding the sword in his right hand, Luo Jianqing sneered, \u201cwell, you might never will see him again.\u201dIgnoring the satire in Luo Jianqing\u2019s voice, the pill suddenly told Luo Jianqing, \u201cbut you have his flower.\u201dLuo Jianqing ceased his movement, \u201chis flower?\u201dThe pill nodded. He stretched out his right hand, and suddenly a tiny delicate lotus emerged from his palm. It was an elegant flower, blooming quietly. The pill said, \u201cThis is the flower I was talking about.\u201dLuo Jianqing was shocked, \u201care you saying\u2026\u2026the Nine-Petaled Lotus Record?!\u201d So many guesses flashed across his mind, Luo Jianqing took his time trying to grasp an answer. \u201cThe man you are waiting for is related to Nine-Petaled Lotus Record?\u201dThe Godlike Pill smiled as if he didn\u2019t care it anymore. He shook his head, \u201cI forget who he is, but he is my master. I waited here for tens of thousands of years. He asked me to play Zither for him when he left, and to expect his triumphant return. That day, however, he didn\u2019t come back. The firmament changed, and I\u2019ve never seen him again.\u201dLuo Jianqing frowned in confusion, \u201chis triumph? Senoir, what are you talking about\u2026\u2026?\u201dThe pill said, \u201cmy name is Qing Jun. The day I formed from the furnace, the sky was dyed in a different color, Qing cloud filled the firmament, and by that reason my master named me \u2018Qing Jun\u2019. It was a long time ago, though, I can hardly recall anything.\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean the firmament changed\u2026\u2026.\u201dQing Jun said in a freezing voice, \u201cthat\u2019s not what you creatures should concern.\u201dLuo Jianqing swallowed the words he was about to say, but Mo Qiu sneered at it. \u201cAre you kidding me? There\u2019s something I have no right to concern?\u201dQing Jun peeked at Mo Qiu, \u201cwhen you recovered to your peak and break what\u2019s been confining you for thousands of years, maybe you could concern about it by then.\u201dThe haughtiness disappeared, Mo Qiu stayed silent.Luo Jianqing looked at Mo Qiu and Qing Jun. He suspected that Qing Jun had discovered Mo Qiu\u2019s secret which might give an explanation for Mo Qiu\u2019s astonishingly fast cultivation speed. He didn\u2019t ask anything, though, for this was Mo Qiu\u2019s secret. If Mo Qiu had no intention to tell him, he won\u2019t force him to.However, there was something he couldn\u2019t ignore. He looked to the graceful scholar and said, \u201cSenior, the flower you mentioned is a unique possession of my cultivation sect, owned only by my Master and I. If possible, I don\u2019t want to erase your consciousness. A brilliant Pill Master once told me that the most invaluable component of a Ninth-grade Godlike Pill is the Pill Soul formed when the pill comes out of the furnace. This pill can only be called the Godlike Pill when you are still present.\u201dHeard Luo Jianqing mentioned the lotus, Qing Jun\u2019s eyes immediately kindled with hope. His reaction didn\u2019t escape Luo Jianqing\u2019s observation. Qing Jun stayed silent for a long time, then asked, \u201cthen\u2026\u2026what do you want from me?\u201d\u201cI want you\u2026\u2026to heal someone.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m supposed to do from the beginning. My master created me to save somebody\u2019s life, but, unfortunately, that person died at nowhere before I was formed. Nobody could even find his corpse. Nowadays, the person who reached the highest cultivation period is only an Early-stage Deity Transformation cultivator. I was made to save a dying Late-stage Deity Transformation cultivator. Given that, there\u2019s nobody I cannot heal now.\u201dLuo Jianqing was exultant. \u201cThank you!\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need to. I just want you\u2026\u2026 to take me to your sect.\u201dLuo Jianqing frowned as if he was considering that proposal, but actually he was excited already. With the Pill Soul still present, the Godlike Pill could really do what it was capable of, plus the Pill Soul agreed to save Xuan Lingzi. It solved a lot of problems when the pill asked to come with him.They quickly came out a schedule for the next few days, but Mo Qiu was irritated. Before Luo Jianqing took the Pill Soul back to Tai Hua Mountain, he stood on Luo Jianqing\u2019s way and stretched his arms to block him, \u201cI\u2019m going to Tai Hua Mountain with you as well.\u201dLuo Jianqing looked at him, speechless.\u201cMo Qiu, shouldn\u2019t you go back to the Mo Family?\u201d\u201cI am going to Tai Hua Mountain. I heard that several days later Tai Hua Mountain will hold the septennial sects competition. I will be there for you. Nobody can harm you with my presence. You will be the winner.\u201d\u201c\u2026\u2026I will be the winner no matter you\u2019re present or not. I am the only disciple who reached the Nascent Soul Period.\u201dMo Qiu was shocked, \u201cyou are the only one? What happened to Tai Hua Mountain?\u201d\u201cWell, you can\u2019t count the numbers like that. Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples are way younger than those of the other sects. You are a genius, do not put your standard on our sect, okay? Look at our generation. I once thought Yan Su who almost fulfilled the Early-stage of the Nascent Soul Period is the strongest of us. Who knows you, a guy coming out from nowhere, snatched the title this quick.\u201dDelighted, Mo Qiu accepted the compliments but didn\u2019t give up his plan going to Tai Hua Mountain. He coaxed and pestered Luo Jianqing for three days. At the moment Luo Jianqing was about to take Qing Jun out of Billion Beasts Mountain, Mo Qiu started to confront Luo Jianqing, \u201cLuo Jianqing, I saved you, TWICE! Why can\u2019t you just say yes to this little favor?!\u201dLuo Jianqing sighed, \u201cMo Qiu, it wasn\u2019t me but\u2026\u2026you are a Fiend Cultivator. Don\u2019t step out of Billion Beasts Mountain. A Fiend Cultivator beyond Nascent Soul Period can\u2019t hide himself. Cultivator with higher cultivation than you can easily spot you.\u201dHearing this, somehow, Mo Qiu asked Luo Jianqing in a joyful voice, \u201cYou refused my request because of this?\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded.Mo Qiu smiled, \u201ceasy, as long as I don\u2019t expose myself, nobody can find out I am a Fiend Cultivator, not even your Master Xuan Lingzi.\u201dLuo Jianqing was doubtful, \u201cis it true?\u201d\u201cOf course.\u201dQing Jun nodded as well, and said in a mild voice, \u201cwhat he said is true.\u201dSo they left the Billion Beasts Mountain and came back to Tai Hua Mountain.That day, the sky was clear and the mountain magnificent as it always was. Two disciples who were responsible for guarding the gate was chatting. Suddenly, they saw three lights flew from the edge of the firmament and landed in front of the gate.The two disciples looked at the three guys, eyes widened, astonished. They turned their back and yelled towards the sect with shock in their voice, \u201cBreaking news! The Great Senior Disciple is back with his wife and son!!!\u201dLuo Jianqing who was about to speak, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dMo Qiu who was wearing in scarlet, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dQing Jun who transformed into a kid because of the injury, \u201c\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(1)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 65: Jianqing, What Should I Do If You Died? (1)The news spread all over Tai Hua Mountain within one hour.Xie Zizhuo who was always very interested in this kind of thing flew out of Hao Ming Peak, asking every disciple he met, \u201cour Great Brother came back with his wife? With a son aged ten? Really?\u201dThe sixth brother Xiu Hen who was designing weapon heard the news. He put down the weapon in his hand and frowned, \u201cthe Great Brother takes his wife and son back to Tai Hua Mountain? While his wife is still pregnant?\u201dThe fifth brother Huo Yuchong rushed out from Yu Shou Peak and encountered the third sister who always kept a poker face, Wei Qiongyin. Huo Yuchong was surprised, \u201csister, did you\u2026 did you hear the rumor as well and came out to see what happened?\u201dWei Qiongyin nodded, \u201csurely we all care about our Great Brother\u2019s marriage. I heard that his wife looks scary and fights valiantly, I wonder\u2026\u201d, Wei Qiongyin stopped for a while, \u201cI wonder how our Great Brother fell in love with her.\u201dHuo Yuchong saw second brother Zuo Yunmo flying by. He stopped him and asked where he was going. Huo Yuchong sensed sorrow out of him, then he heard the later saying, \u201cI heard Great Brother brought back his wife and son, and\u2026 they seemed deeply in love with each other. Great Brother brought her straight towards Yu Xiao Peak once they were back.\u201d\u201cHe wants to introduce her to Sir Xuan Lingzi?\u201dZuo Yunmo nodded reluctantly but failed to force a smile.Suddenly a red glittering light rushed out from Qing Lan Peak. That was the little sister who was in seclusion trying to pass the middle-stage of Gold Core! She brandished her sword and rushing straight towards the Yu Xiao Peak. After she made it to the gate, she yelled, \u201cGreat Brother! I come to visit my sister-in-law and my nephew! Let me in! I need to fight with\u2026 no, chat with your wife!\u201dLuo Jianqing, Mo Qiu, and Qing Kun who just arrived at Yu Xiao Peak, \u201c\u2026\u201dMo Qiu was the first one who couldn\u2019t bear to hear it anymore. He took out his scourge and said, \u201cLuo Jianqing, let me take care of this weirdo. Wait a moment here. I\u2019ll make her take that back. Who the hell is her sister-in-law!?\u201dLooking at Mo Qiu silently, Qing Kun stood beside Luo Jianqing, with no expression on his face. He didn\u2019t say anything until Mo Qiu couldn\u2019t hold his temper. \u201cAre you really going to bully a woman? I thought the cultivators of your kind were just a bunch of people who want to let out their true selves, but, well, I never thought you guys would even bully a woman.\u201dMo Qiu yelled at him in anger, \u201cshut up!\u201dQing Kun said these words in total calmness, but his gestures were \u2013 in some level \u2013 contradicted with his cute childish face. A little kid with chubby visage saying some profound sentences, even Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help laughing.Luo Jianqing shook his head, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect they would misunderstand. I\u2019ll lead you through the forest to my house, before I go to Cang Shuang Peak to report everything to Sir Hao Xingzi. That should sort things out.\u201dQing Kun nodded like a well-behaved kid.On the contrary, though satisfied with this solution, Mo Qiu sniggered, \u201cthat\u2019s right. How can I be your wife?! Even if we are married\u2026\u201d, he stopped for a moment, \u201ceven if the rumor is true, you are the one who should be \u2018wife\u2019!\u201dLuo Jianqing let out a laugh\u2026 and slapped Mo Qiu\u2019s face with his scabbard.Nobody knew what Mo Qiu was thinking about. This Late-stage Nascent Soul Period cultivator wasn\u2019t able to dodge the slap.Mo Qiu was knocked into the air.Not before long, he flew back, totally irritated, \u201cLuo! Jian! Qing!\u201dThe gorgeous cultivator lifted his eyes and took a glance at him, \u201cyes? I am listening. You don\u2019t need to raise your voice.\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dThe sound of their laughing and chatting fulfilled the bamboo forest. Breeze came in, inviting the leaves to dance. They\u2019ve lightened up one end of the forest, which made the other side drowned into extreme solitude.The moment Luo Jianqing stepped into the Tai Hua Mountain, Xuan Lingzi opened his eyes. He quickened his way to the window, then looked at the Mountain Gate in distance.It\u2019s been too long. His disciple finally came back to the Yu Xiao Peak\u2026 with two strangers.Xuan Lingzi had lingered behind the door for a long time. In the past, every time Luo Jianqing came back, he would come out of seclusion and meet him in person to make sure his disciple was truly all right. This time, however, he had a quarrel with Jianqing before the latter went out, not to mention Jianqing discovered his secret. How could he face Luo Jianqing\u2026But there was no choice left for Xuan Lingzi. He found out the cultivator dressing scarlet and a kid in bice clothes very soon.Xuan Lingzi knew Mo Qiu once saved Luo Jianqing\u2019s life. He saw this cultivator once in the Liu Yan Valley in his primordial life, but the kid\u2026 when Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Spiritual Sense passed through the kid, he was stunned, and then sensed it several times.There was no doubt that this was a normal six-or-seven-year-old kid with no Spiritual Power nor Spiritual Bones.Why did Jianqing bring a kid like this to Tai Hua Mountain?This kid in bice was standing beside Jianqing who was also wearing bice, and the younger one was even holding Jianqing\u2019s hand!Xuan Lingzi\u2019s eyes widened and felt his heart twisted.That boy\u2026 looked like Jianqing!The Spiritual Sense of a cultivator at Deity Transformation Period wasn\u2019t a thing that Luo Jianqing and Qing Kun could feel, but Mo Qiu looked at Xuan Lingzi\u2019s direction with a complicated expression on his face. Luo Jianqing led them pass through the forest and arrived at the two bamboo houses.Green forest surrounded the two houses, with several spiritual herb garden decorated around. There were spiritual flowers planted in the garden as well. A delicate pavilion was sat beside the river. The water was flowing along. The whole place was plain but snug.Qing Kun was satisfied with this place. He walked straight to the stone seat and sat down while Mo Qiu still wandered around and set his eyes on Xuan Lingzi\u2019s house. The Fiend Cultivator dressed in scarlet intentionally raised his voice. \u201cLittle beauty, you live here by yourself? Alone? That\u2019s perfect! I\u2019ll share a room with you tonight. Let the kid stay in the other one.\u201dQing Kun ignored him.Luo Jianqing put his hand on the scabbard, about to slap Mo Qiu one more time but was interrupted by the latter.Mo Qiu raised an eyebrow, smiling mildly, \u201cabout to do it again?\u201dLuo Jianqing peeked at him and drew back his scabbard, said, \u201cthe other house belongs to my Master. Do not bother him while he is in seclusion. I have an extra bamboo bed in my room. I will share a bed with Qing Kun tonight. You can use the other one. Cultivators like us don\u2019t have particular demand for sleeping. Relaxation can be done by meditation, after all.\u201dMo Qiu\u2019s mouth twitched, \u201cyou\u2019d rather sleep with him but not me?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Luo Jianqing was about to say something, but, to everyone\u2019s surprise, the next moment a tremendous force suppressed on their bodies.Subconsciously, Luo Jianqing quickly flew to the pavilion and used his own body to protect Qing Kun from the force while Mo Qiu tried to keep his back straight and stared at Xuan Lingzi\u2019s house with a sneer hung on his face.Qing Kun was still recovering from his previous injuries. Luo Jianqing needed him to heal Xuan Lingzi, and that was the main reason he protected him in the first place. However, Xuan Lingzi interpreted Luo Jianqing\u2019s action as a completely different thing, which made him totally ignored Mo Qiu who was standing stiff with a careless face.Why are you protecting him? Why do you care about him so much?Six or seven years old\u2026 Luo Jianqing went out for more experiences during that time, but Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Primordial Life followed him and didn\u2019t discover anything usual. Could it be\u2026 could it be that he missed something?Xuan Lingzi immediately lost his strength and tripped.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t know his Master had misunderstood him. He thought that those lower-level cultivation disciples might have mistaken Mo Qiu as a woman, but Xuan Lingzi was different. He could surely recognize that Mo Qiu was a man, and of course he wouldn\u2019t misperceive their relationship.However, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t take this into consideration \u2013 Xuan Lingzi mistook Qing Kun as his son.Luo Jianqing held Qing Kun into his arms, protecting him, then raised his voice, \u201cMaster, it\u2019s me. I came back.\u201dThe force wasn\u2019t dismissed.Noticing Mo Qiu couldn\u2019t bear this anymore and almost bowed down, Luo Jianqing said again, \u201cMaster, I went to the Wan Shou Peak this time, and I was worried about your injury. These are my friends. I will go to your place\u2026 wait outside after I settle them down.\u201dThe fierce force was finally withdrawn.Luo Jianqing sighed in relieve, leading Qing Kun to his bamboo house. Mo Qiu was irritated a little by what just happened, but still followed Luo Jianqing into the house.After they got in, Mo Qiu was totally intrigued by the furniture and decorations in the house. He wandered around in the room, like an energetic curious child, while Qing Kun sat on a chair quietly.Luo Jianqing said, \u201cyou guys wait for me here. My Master knew that I came back. I need to greet him.\u201dMo Qiu wasn\u2019t happy with this arrangement, \u201cyou\u2019ve traveled a long way back, why didn\u2019t HE come out to welcome you? Where is his manners?\u201dLuo Jianqing immediately changed into a ashen face and said, \u201cwatch your mouth!\u201d, then tipped Mo Qiu a wink.Mo Qiu surely understood what Luo Jianqing meant. His friend was reminding him that Xuan Lingzi could hear every word they had spoken, but Mo Qiu couldn\u2019t care less about it. He dragged Luo Jianqing\u2019s sleeve, wouldn\u2019t let him go.Neither of them wanted to give in first. Suddenly, Qing Kun said, \u201cit\u2019s a little bit cold.\u201dLuo Jianqing and Mo Qiu stopped what they were doing to sense the cold. Surprised, they nodded in agreement, \u201cyes, it is\u2026?\u201dIn the house next to Luo Jianqing\u2019s, Xuan Lingzi was already an iced statue, \u201c\u2026\u201d.Kicking Mo Qiu into the room, Luo Jianqing finally got to the other house. He didn\u2019t ask Xuan Lingzi to open the door this time. Bowed down, he told his Master what he experienced these months, then lowered his voice, \u201cMaster, I have something to tell you secretly, please set up a ward.\u201dMo Qiu\u2019s Cultivation stage was higher than Luo Jianqing\u2019s. Since their houses were so close, eavesdropping was a piece of cake for him.This time, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t wait long for Xuan Lingzi\u2019s respond. \u201cI\u2019ve set it long before.\u201dLuo Jianqing was shocked. He thought: long before? He did it as soon as I started talking?Luo Jianqing then asked Xuan Lingzi, \u201cMaster, did you see that kid I brought here?\u201dXuan Lingzi, \u201c\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing touched his own arms and suddenly felt the temperature went even lower.After a long time, Xuan Lingzi responded him in a very unusual tone, \u201cI\u2026 saw him.\u201dLuo Jianqing was speechless. Why did his Master look a bit upset?He couldn\u2019t figure out a reason. Luo Jianqing frowned, \u201cMaster, I brought him here at the Yu Xiao Peak to introduce him to you.\u201dXuan Lingzi said, \u201c\u2026I\u2019m not going to meet him.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s eyes widened, \u201cMaster?\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s voice was cold as ice, \u201cI will never meet him!\u201d\u201c\u2026but, Master, he might be the one and only Ninth-level Godlike Pill in the whole world. You\u2019ve split your Primordial Life for me, risking your life several times and got seriously wounded. He can heal you. If you refuse to meet him, then what I did, what I\u2019ve been through, those life-threatening dangers that I faced\u2026could all be meaningless. I did everything in vain!\u201d, Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t hold back his anger.Why! I put in all my efforts to bring back the pill in order to treat your injuries. I escaped from the jaw of death and endured tremendous sufferings caused by bleeding gash. I did all of these to bring the Godlike Pill to you. Now you\u2019re telling me that you\u2019ll never meet the pill?Why?!Sorrow boiled in his heart, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t care about if Mo Qiu and Qing Kun werepeeking at them, he clenched his fists, trying hard to control himself from whacking the tightly closed door.Naturally, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t know that Xuan Lingzi was stunned by his words.Ninth-level Godlike Pill?That wasn\u2019t Jianqing\u2019s child but a pill?Delight didn\u2019t last long. Xuan Lingzi felt his heart twisted together when he heard Luo Jianqing said \u2018life-threatening dangers\u2019.He opened the door before he even knew what he was doing.Luo Jianqing was drawing his sword out, about to break the door, \u2026then he fell into Xuan Lingzi\u2019s arms and was dragged into the room.Boom!The door closed behind him.Sneaking behind the door trying hard to have a peek, Mo Qiu wasn\u2019t expecting Luo Jianqing\u2019s appearance, \u201cwhat the hell? I can understand the ward, but, into the house? Come on! Why do they have to speak inside?\u201dQing Kun filled his cup with tea, \u201cwell, why would they stay outside? For your convenience to peek at them?\u201dMo Qiu was irritated but couldn\u2019t find any word to refute him.Inside the other bamboo house, Luo Jianqing never thought he could see his Master this soon.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(3)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHe was dragged into a warm and broad chest. The light aroma of lotus surrounded Luo Jianqing who was totally in shock. His brain went blank; he only knew that he was carried into the room. Then his Master let go of him and asked with an ungovernable nervousness hidden in his voice, \u201cyou got hurt? Life-threatening dangers? Jianqing, tell me, what\u2026 happened\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing held Xuan Lingzi tight in his arms, the latter was stunned, didn\u2019t even know where to put his arms.And it was until now that Xuan Lingzi realized he had opened the door and let Luo Jianqing in, just because he was so worried about his disciple.Xuan Lingzi tried to shove Luo Jianqing away, but the latterwouldn\u2019t let go. He used his Spiritual Power to strengthen the force, but the moment his fingertips touched Luo Jianqing\u2019s arms, he heard Luo Jianqing sniggered, \u201cWu Yin, you do like me.\u201dXuan Lingzi froze. His throat is so dry that he couldn\u2019t utter a word.Luo Jianqing looked up at him. Delight was glittering in his mesmerizing eyes. He stared at his elegant Master who was petrified completely, suddenly recalled what filled in his mind when he almost got killed by that Gold Sun Heaven Live Jiao \u2013 he wasn\u2019t regretting about not killing Li Xiuchen for revenge, or questioning Xuan Lingzi why he gave Xuan Ling Sword to Li Xiuchen in the last life, instead\u2026He felt nothing but resentment and sorrow because he realized that he never really been in a relationship with Xuan Lingzi in their last life, ever.He knew his Master loved him, and he knew this was true the other way around.However, they were restricted by the rules and boundaries set by the earthly world. They were Master and disciple, a pair who shouldn\u2019t and couldn\u2019t fall in love with each other. If others knew they desired for each other, they would be disdained by the whole world. His Master even confined himself in the house and refused to see him, with a determination of never seeing his disciple again until his death.Did others\u2019 opinion really matter that much?After degenerating into a Fiend Cultivator in his last life, Luo Jianqing started to think in the Fiend Cultivator\u2019s way. He must get his Master no matter what it took. He would never let what happened in his last life happen again. He would mend the resentment, even if it meant to drag Wu Yin down from the shrine. It might be a good thing, right? This way, at least they could fall together.A plan came up in his mind. Luo Jianqing\u2019s winsome visage was covered with bleakness, he said in a husky voice, \u201cof course, you won\u2019t admit it. I am your disciple, so you won\u2019t accept me the whole life, but I couldn\u2019t care less about that. What I do care is your health. The name of that pill is Qing Kun. He is specialized in healing and curing. I put lots of efforts to get him because I want to cure your injured Primordial Life. Wu Yin, no matter what, please meet him.\u201dXuan Lingzi looked at his disciple, speechless.Luo Jianqing was still hugging him tight. Their chests snuggled up to each other. The distance was so close that they seemed to hear the heartbeats going wild. The tips of Xuan Lingzi\u2019s ears flushed. He wanted to push Luo Jianqing away from him, but couldn\u2019t lift his arms as if he lost the rein of his own body.He never saw his disciple this unhappy before.Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes were rippling as if he\u2019s going to cry but forced himself to hold the tears back. His voice went hoarse, but he tried hard to conceal it. He was begging him. He was begging him to see that pill and accept his kindness.Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t have the heart to push Luo Jianqing away, especially when his disciple was in great sorrow.Suddenly, memories came back like roaring flood and he was drowned in it. He recalled what happened forty-one years ago when he realized that a supernal spiritual bone was about to be born. In amazement, he split his Primordial Life to check what was going on.Beside the shore of Luo River, he saw that tiny infant crying in a basket floating along the river. Wherever the basket went, the water turned crystal clear. Lighting and thunder stroke down around the basket but didn\u2019t hurt the baby at all, as if it was a ward of protection, keeping away all the other threats from the outside.This was a sign of the supernal spiritual bone. Xuan Lingzi himself was born with auspicious clouds fulfilling the sky, along with lotus flower blooming for thousands of miles. This boy, however, was born with refined river and striking thunder. He remembered taking the boy out of the basket and holding him in his arms. The infant fixed his black eyes on Xuan Lingzi and stopped crying.Xuan Lingzi was stunned, but the infant didn\u2019t take away his gaze from him and suddenly smiled. He waved his chubby arms and pulled Xuan Lingzi\u2019s hair while still staring at Xuan Lingzi who was already drowned in his gaze.At that moment, Xuan Lingzi knew this infant would be his one and only disciple in his life.\u201cMy real name is Wu Yin, monastic name Xuan Lingzi. From now on, I am your Master. You summoned lightning and thunder to the terra, and made Luo River crystal clear, and by that, I will name you \u2013 Luo Jianqing (T/N: in Chinese, Jianqing means \u2018becoming clear\u2019)\u201dTime went fast. Before Luo Jianqing reached the age of four, Xuan Lingzi entrusted the boy to Zuo Yunmo, the Great Senior Brother at that time. When Luo Jianiqng was four-year-old, he brought him back from Hao Ming Peak. The boy looked at him without a slightest trust, as if he didn\u2019t know him at all.Noticed his gaze, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s heart went tender. He told Luo Jianqing in a mild voice, \u201cI am your Master, Jianqing.\u201dJianqing wasn\u2019t a super hard-working cultivator when he was little. He often fell into sleep when meditating, many times leaned himself on Xuan Lingzi\u2019s lap.Xuan Lingzi had been a cultivator for over three hundred years and reached the Deity Transformation Period. A genius indeed, but he never took care of a child before. Luo Jianqing fell into sleep on his lap, and Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t even dare to move, in case he woke him up.He would just look at Luo Jianiqng all day long until the boy woke up.In the evening, he would share his bed with him.Jianqing was so tiny, leaning on his chest. Warmth was delivered from where the boy lay. Xuan Lingzi\u2019s frozen mask was broken into pieces. He smiled blandly and embraced the boy.When Luo Jianqing was ten years old. Xuan Lingzi believed something should be changed. He built another bamboo house and asked Luo Jianqing to live there alone. In the evening, however, Jianqing sneaked into Xuan Lingzi\u2019s room. The Master was disappointed and irritated by Luo Jianqing\u2019s disobedience, but, he had to admit, he was also slightly delighted.So, that night, he allowed Jianqing to sleep with him.That was the first and last time Luo Jianqing sneak into his room in the night.When Luo Jianqing reached fourteen years old, he was ready to establish the foundation, but Xuan Lingzi asked him to enter the Billion Beasts Mountain to sharpen his skills for three years.That was the first time Luo Jianqing went out for experiences.He came back as a handsome and successful cultivator. That day, Xuan Lingzi stood at the top of Yu Xiao Peak, gazing at the gate of Tai Hua Mountain. When he saw his disciple stepping in, he was astonished.As a sword unsheathed, radiating splendid aura!The mesmerizing eyes, the winsome lips, the silk-like hair, the gorgeous visage\u2026 so elegant, so graceful, the moon and the sun would lose their aura if his disciple stood beside them.He watched this young man step forward and bow down at him and say in respect, \u201cMaster.\u201dAt this very instant, Xuan Lingzi felt his heart which had been tranquil for hundreds of years suddenly jolted. He looked at his disciple whom he knew so well but distanced away. He remembered what Luo Jianqing liked to do most when he was little was to hug him; he remembered his disciple liked vegetable but was not a fan of meat; he remembered this kid would cultivate for days restlessly every time he rebuked him; he even remembered seventeen years ago when he brought Luo Jianqing back from the shore of Luo River\u2026 the time they spent together, the things they\u2019ve been through, he remembered them all.But, he could feel his heartbeat accelerating.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had never been this close to someone before. Sharing a bed with him for six years, putting all his efforts in educating him, for seventeen years, Xuan Lingzi had his life revolving around Luo Jianqing, then he realized that he had fallen in love with this young man\u2026\u2026who was only his disciple.Without hearing his Master\u2019s respond for a long time, Luo Jianiqng lifted his head to see what was going on.Xuan Lingzi flushed while looking at Luo Jianqing\u2019s innocent eyes. He felt himself ashamed by his deviance. What was he thinking about? This kid is his own disciple! He shouldn\u2019t have had that thought about his disciple.From then on, Xuan Lingzi kept a distance with Luo Jianqing. He refrained himself from caring Luo Jianqing except when he needed some guidance.But one day, Luo Jianqing came back from the Billion Beasts Mountain with an injury caused by a Flaming Iron Ant. The beast left a poison inside Luo Jianqing\u2019s body, which wasn\u2019t life-threatening but indeed torturous. Once a week, Luo Jianqing would suffer from the unbearable pain caused by the poison which made him feel like burning in fire.The Flaming Iron Ant was just a Fifth-level Demon Beast. A weak beast indeed, but there was no antidote to its poison.Even Yu Qingzi couldn\u2019t find a way to heal Luo Jianqing completely. Her best option was to merely ease his pain. Xuan Lingzi went to seclusion for several days, searching among all kinds of ancient books for possible solutions. At last, he found one. Together with his disciple, he stepped into Yue Hua Pool, nakedly. Their palms connected to each other, then Xuan Lingzi forced all of his Spiritual Power into Luo Jianqing\u2019s body, letting the poison flow away with Yue Hua Pool\u2019s water.Xuan Lingzi concealed his feelings for several years. He did such a great job. Even himself almost forgot he was attracted by his disciple. However, the three days in the Yue Hua Pool brought back his thoughts towards Luo Jianqing: facing his disciple, he couldn\u2019t ignore his emotions anymore.Like a growing vine, his love tangled him up, tangling the rules, boundaries, and limitations that had been restricting him for hundreds of years.He even had filthy thoughts emerging in his mind!When the last wisp of poison was driven out, Luo Jianqing suddenly moved, and touched Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Primordial Life. A shiver of delight, pleasure, joy, comfort\u2026went through Xuan Lingzi\u2019s body.He couldn\u2019t help but drag Luo Jianqing into his arms and sealed Luo Jianqing\u2019s lips with his own.At that instant, Xuan Lingzi woke up from his lust in Luo Jianqing\u2019s astounded gaze.He immediately erased Luo Jianqing\u2019s memory about that kiss, then brought his disciple out of the Yue Hua Pool.Since then, he reduced his contact with Luo Jianqing. He started to have difficulties understanding what his disciple was thinking about. They were not as close as they used to be. Now, however, his disciple held him tight in his arms, spoke out his filthy thoughts, left him nowhere to escape, nowhere to hide.But, they are Master and disciple. What he felt about Luo Jianqing was not correct. It was incest, profane, preposterous\u2026Xuan Lingzi\u2019s eyes suddenly widened; a scene of bloodshed emerged in his mind.A ruthless sword, a wind-roaring edge, countless witnessing cultivators, a breathless young man drowned in blood\u2026 the whole world was dyed in scarlet, even the wind carried the smell of blood. His disciple was lying at the edge of the cliff, and his bice robe was soaked with blood. His mind went blank. The only thing he knew was that his disciple won\u2019t open his eyes anymore, all was because a sword which he couldn\u2019t be more familiar with stabbed through his disciple\u2019s chest.Xuan Lingzi was shivering drastically, which startled Luo Jianqing who immediately put Xuan Lingzi on the bed and asked him what was wrong in a caring voice. Nevertheless, with redness slowly engraved his eyes, Xuan Lingzi kept shivering, almost gone mad.Tremendous Spiritual Power went out of control and was hitting here and there in the room. Although Xuan Lingzi had lost his sense, his enraged Spiritual Power didn\u2019t hurt Luo Jianqing even for a single wisp of hair.Luo Jianqing kept trying to wake Xuan Lingzi up, \u201cMaster! Master, look at me. Listen! Is it your wounds on Primordial Life that make you suffer? I will bring Qing Kun here, alright? Hang on, Master! I promise that I will never threaten or force you again. Master, I\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s lips was sealed by his Master\u2019s.It was a searing kiss, with emotions that was concealed for almost half a decade. Luo Jianqing widened his eyes in disbelief, but he could feel a firm hand holding his waist like an unbreakable shackle, constraining him, leaving him no room to escape.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s tip of tongue unclenched Luo Jianqing\u2019s teeth and slipped into his mouth. His tongue licked every bit of membrane inside his disciple\u2019s mouth. His teeth softly bit Luo Jianqing\u2019s lips, letting the later moan with delight.A satisfied feeling was delivered from where their lips were connected. At last, Luo Jianqing subconsciously embraced Xuan Lingzi and closed his eyes, responded his Master with all his passion.They had forgotten where they were; they had forgotten the date and the time; they had forgotten what it meant to be Master and disciple; they had forgotten all these rules that kept them apart!Drowned in the vast emotion bursting out because of the kiss, Luo Jianqing could hardly breathe, but Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t let him go. His Master was still kissing him. The sucking sound exited both of them. A line of transparent silver dripped from Luo Jianqing\u2019s mouth.He flushed.When the kiss finally ended, Luo Jianqing\u2019s redden lips swollen. Panting, he tried to calm down and regain a stable breath but felt a drop of tear landed on his face. He was stunned, then slowly lifted his head.Xuan Lingzi fixed his gaze on him in silence. Sorrow emerged on his face which was always emotionless, as if his heart was burning in tremendous pain, he was trapped in infinite despair, or he was swallowed by endless desperation. Xuan Lingzi mumbled in a hoarse voice, \u201cJianqing, please don\u2019t leave me\u2026 don\u2019t die. Come back\u2026 I can\u2019t live without you\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing couldn\u2019t hear him clearly, \u201cMaster, what are you talking about?\u201dThe next moment, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s eyes clenched and then he collapsed.Luo Jianqing caught him in the air.From his facial expression, Luo Jianqing can tell his Master was suffering. He tried to use the Spiritual Sense to check in the state of Xuan Lingzi\u2019s body, but was whacked by Xuan Lingzi\u2019s enraged Spiritual Power.Suddenly, Xuan Lingzi spat out a mouthful blood.Luo Jianqing was shocked. He rushed out of the house, worry written on his face. Qing Kun was drinking tea when Luo Jianqing broke the door and dragged him to Xuan Lingzi\u2019s house.Mo Qiu was attracted by one of the decorations in Luo Jianqing\u2019s room. Seeing Luo Jianqing taking Qing Kun away, he put down his new toy and followed them. Once he saw Xuan Lingzi lying on the bed without conciousness, Mo Qiu\u2019s pupils shrank; he subconsciously summoned Fiend Power and was about to attack him. However, that only lasted for an instant. He saw Luo Jianqing brought Qing Kun to the bedside of Xuan Lingzi, and nervously asked Qing Kun to treat him.Mo Qiu was stunned when he saw Luo Jianqing\u2019s swollen lips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(5)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter a very long time, Qing Kun finally said, \u201cSir Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Primordial Life is indeed badly injured, but I am just a pill, not a Pill Cultivator, so I don\u2019t know exactly what\u2019s going on in his body. His cultivation is far beyond mine. Only cultivators at the Da Sheng Period and above can find out the specific reason.\u201dLuo Jianqing immediately stood up, \u201cI\u2019ll go find Respected Master Yu Qingzi! She\u2019s only late-stage of Tribulation Passage, but she is one of the best alchemists in the world!\u201dHowever, when Luo Jianqing was about to leave, Mo Qiu stopped him.Mo Qiu\u2019s face turned cold and ashen; he gazed at Luo Jianqing with mixed feelings, \u201cI can figure out what\u2019s going on with him.\u201dMo Qiu stepped forward. After a short period of time, he held back his Spiritual Sense and told Luo Jianqing, \u201che lost rein of his emotions. His Primordial Life was wounded already, but this time, he was backfired by suffering memories, so his condition got worse. There\u2019s no need to find others. This kid here can cure him.\u201d\u201cAre you sure?\u201d, asked by Luo Jianqing.Qing Kun said in a calm voice, \u201cI trust him. It won\u2019t be that hard since we know the cause now. You guys may leave right now. I will use my Pill Power to heal his Primordial Life. It will take some time. In three or seven days he will be cured.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded at once, dragging Mo Qiu away from the house. When they were outside the house, Luo Jianqing kept lingering at the gate in anxiety, completely forgot Mo Qiu was still there.Time was passing. Little Sister was calling at the mountain feet to see Luo Jianqing again.Mo Qiu looked at Luo Jianqing without any expression, while the later was gazing at the gate.\u201cYour sister is forsaking to see you again. You said that you will explain to her and go to find Sir Hao Xingzi, right? That kid needs three days at least. You can leave now. It\u2019s not a big deal.\u201d\u201cI can do these things after he wakes up.\u201dMo Qiu frowned and didn\u2019t say a word.He stared at Luo Jianqing for a while, then shoved his sleeves and left, with bleakness hidden in his eyes. His scarlet robe seemed like a blood-dripping broken heart. He went straight back to Luo Jianqing\u2019s bamboo house and slammed the door as if he was expressing his anger.Three days later, Qing Kun came out of the house with a pale face. He told Luo Jianqing the moment he saw him, \u201cNo worries. Your Master has already woken up.\u201d The next moment, Qing Kun was transformed into a bice pill and flew into Luo Jianqing\u2019s palm.Luo Jianqing put the pill back into his Interspatial Ring, then stepped forward to open the door. However, as soon as his fingertips touched the door, a ward was activated and knocked him into the air. Luo Jianqing looked at the door with confusion. Time passed, finally, he yelled at the house hoarsely, \u201cWu Yin!\u201dThere was no response.Luo Jianqing stood up, teeth clenched, \u201cWu Yin, now what? Three days ago, it was you who kissed me; It was you who held me in your arms. You already broke the rules, then now why do you forbid me from entering?!\u201dThere was only silence replying him.Though angry, Luo Jianqing still cared about his master\u2019s state. Finally, he gave in. \u201cWhatever, if you don\u2019t want to come out, I will not force you to, but, Master, I am worried about your health. Are you fully recovered? Are you feeling better? Do you need\u2026\u201d\u201cJianqing,\u201d this hoarse voice shocked Luo Jianqing, \u201cplease\u2026 give me some time.\u201dHis Master said \u201cplease\u201d.Under the scorching sun, a bice figuring was standing in front of the bamboo house. Forest whispering in the wind and the clouds gathering and dispersing, days of worry made Luo Jianqing tired. He stared at the tightly closed door for a long time then chuckled. He bowed at the gate, \u201cFine, I will leave right now.\u201dLuo Jianqing left Xuan Lingzi\u2019s house as fast as he could but didn\u2019t go back to his own.He stood under the stone pavilion, gazing into empty air for a long time. Suddenly, he took out the Floating Frost from the center of his eyebrows and started to practice!Wherever his Sword Qi touched, a gale followed, and left a gash of sword trace. The bamboo fell like fragile wheat under Luo Jianqing\u2019s merciless sword. The bice figure was brandishing sword in the forest, while Xuan Lingzi\u2019s house was left tranquil. On the other side of the forest, the Fiend Cultivator in red stood beside the window, watching Luo Jianqing exercising with a cold face.\u201cXuan Lingzi, well, I can\u2019t believe you fall in love with your own disciple. If the commoners know this, who will still respect you as the greatest cultivator in the world? Others will surely hold you in disdain, if\u2026\u201dMo Qiu suddenly stopped murmuring. He fixed his eyes on Luo Jianqing who was still practicing his sword for a long time before he moved his eyes off him.\u201cAfter all, we are friends of life and death\u2026 I will keep it as a secret. Luo Jianqing, I\u2019m doing this for you.\u201dSurprisingly, Mo Qiu\u2019s words weren\u2019t heard by Xuan Lingzi who was just a few meters away.Now, rumors about the Senior Brother were spreading quickly all over the Tai Hua Mountain. When heard someone saying \u201cthe Senior Brother brought back three women who were all as beautiful as fairies\u201d, Sir Hao Xingzi couldn\u2019t wait to go to the Yu Xiao Peak himself.Luo Jianqing pondered awhile before he said to Sir Hao Xingzi, \u201cSir, these are all misunderstandings. The cultivator in scarlet is my friend of life and death. As you can see, he is a man. He is interested in our Septennial Competition, so I invited him to come and watch the rival. As for the child\u2026\u201d, Luo Jianqing stopped for a second, \u201che is also my friend.\u201dThe Ninth-grade Pill finally settled in the Interspatial Ring \u2013 Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t betray him.Sir Hao Xingzi touched his beard and cast a weird glance at Mo Qiu, \u201cJianqing, your friend looks a little bit familiar.\u201d Mo Qiu sneered lightly, but Hao Xingzi didn\u2019t pay much attention to it, \u201cthree days later, the Septennial Competition of Tai Hua Mountain will begin. Yun Mo is in charge of entertaining the coming guests. Jian Qing, you need to take extra care this time.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dHao Xingzi sighed, \u201cfive years ago, your fight in the Liu Yan Valley made you even more famous than before. They are saying that you are a hundred times more powerful than Yan Su who is now in his sixties. He cultivated longer than you for twenty years. However, he is only a Nascent Soul Period cultivator right now \u2013 the same as your level.\u201dLuo Jianqing started to take this matter seriously.Hao Xingzi added, \u201cThis time, Yan Su will be there as audience. As for those fought with you in the Liu Yan Valley, for instance the Bai Family and the Yun Family, they will send their best disciples of young generations to come here and watch the competition as well. All of the young elites from the Four Sects will be there, and the eight families won\u2019t miss this opportunity. They\u2026 are up to something.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded, \u201cI understand.\u201dHao Xingzi looked at Luo Jianqing with appreciation in his eyes, \u201cTai Hua Mountain is going through a hard time. Jianqing, as the Senior Brother, a huge responsibility is on your shoulder now!\u201dThe sun raised and fell as usual. Three days passed quickly. Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s septennial competition was about to commence!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The treatment costed him too much Pill Energy. In need of a good rest, he informed Luo Jianqing of it prior to his sleep, otherwise Luo Jianqing would surely worry about him.Suddenly, Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu were the only two left on the whole Yu Xiao Peak.During this time, Luo Jianqing kept practicing sword to relieve his depression. It was when Sir Hao Xingzi came to the Yu Xiao Peak to inform him to get prepared for the Competition that Luo Jianqing finally regained his normal state of mind.One day before the Septennial Competition, Zuo Yunmo came to the Yu Xiao Peak to tell him the procedure of this year\u2019s competition.Hanging the Qing Yun Sword at the waist and wearing a flaxen robe as always, Zuo Yunmo was smiling blandly, \u201clike the past ones, this time, you can decide whether you want to watch the competition among Qi Condensation Period disciples and Foundation Establishment Period disciples. This year, you are the only one \u2013 of all the Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples \u2013 who reached the Nascent Soul Period, so there is no need to compete with Gold Core Period disciples.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded slightly, \u201cbrother, last time you said that you already reached a higher level and asked me to be your practicing rival. When will you have time?\u201dA touch of bleakness raised in Zuo Yunmo\u2019s eyes but was belied by him immediately, \u201chow about we wait until I reach the Nascent Soul Period? That way we could be real matching rivals.\u201dLuo Jianqing was surprised, \u201cyou can break through Nascent Soul Period?\u201d\u201cWithin one year, I believe.\u201dLuo Jianqing complimented Zuo Yunmo again. They chatted for a while until Zuo Yunmo said it was time for him to leave. Pretended to be careless, he asked Luo Jianqing, \u201cthat Cultivator Mo, is he the one who spent three years with you in the Liu Yan Valley and together you guys conquered all the difficulties?\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled, \u201cyes.\u201dZuo Yunmo nodded with a smile. Without asking more about Mo Qiu, he left quickly.Luo Jianqing turned his head and saw Mo Qiu standing behind him. This friend of him seemed obsessed with scarlet dress. Among all the cultivators Luo Jianqing met in his life, except Little Sister, no one kept dressing in this color. However, scarlet looked good on Mo Qiu, who had a delicate glamorous visage.Mo Qiu sneered slightly, \u201cSeems like Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s young generation of disciples are not that promising.\u201dLuo Jianqing paused a second, then he said, \u201cA hundred years ago, our Tai Hua Mountain sent lots of brilliant disciples to the battlefield to fight with Demon Beasts and to defend humans. Little to none of the generation prior of mine was able to come back alive. Honored as the leading sect of three thousand sects, Tai Hua Mountain has the responsibility to put more efforts in it.\u201dMo Qiu kept quiet. After a long silence, he said, \u201cthat Junior Brother of yours only has a high-level First Grade Spiritual Bone. It\u2019s good enough for him to reach late-stage Gold Core Period before he\u2019s sixty years old.\u201dLuo Jianqing knew the meaning behind these words. Mo Qiu was complimenting Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciple. No matter for Dao Cultivator or for Fiend Cultivator, there was one thing that was not going to change \u2013 the hostility to the Demon Beast Clan. Almost a whole generation of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples lost their lives to protect the Human Clan. It was indeed respectable.Luo Jianqing said, \u201cthough Second Junior Brother has the worst Spiritual Bone among the seven of us, he is very hardworking. Just like you. Your Spiritual Bone is not that promising, but you\u2019ve reached Late-stage Nascent Soul Period within sixty years of cultivation. You already surpassed Yan Su of Duan Hun Sect. Mo Qiu, do you really think Spiritual Bone is that important?\u201dMo Qiu smiled, \u201cwell said, I like your idea.\u201dLuo Jianqing was speechless, \u201cwhy do I care if you like it or not?\u201dMo Qiu raised an eyebrow, \u201cwell, maybe one day I will save your life one more time?\u201dExpressionless, Luo Jianqing said, \u201ccan you stop cursing me facing life-threatening dangers?\u201dMo Qiu bursted into laughter.The next day, Luo Jianqing bowed in front of Xuan Lingzi\u2019s house, telling his Master he was about to attend the Septennial Competition.This time, again, silence was what responded to Luo Jianqing. However, suddenly a bleak voice reached Luo Jianqing\u2019s ear, \u201cyou\u2019ve reached Nascent Soul Period. Surely you should broaden your horizon. This time, the Four Sects and Eight Clans aren\u2019t aiming for good. Duan Hun Sect\u2019s Yan Su is also an Early-stage Nascent Soul Period cultivator, but his Nascent Soul is more stable than yours. Jianqing, be careful.\u201dLuo Jianqing wasn\u2019t expecting hearing such a long sentence from his Master. He felt something warm and tender melted at the tip of his heart. It\u2019s like something had changed. Luo Jianqing said, \u201cMaster\u2026 I thought you will say \u2018do not dishonor Yu Xiao Peak\u2019 again.\u201dIt was quiet inside the house, Luo Jianqing kept asking, \u201cyou really think that\u2019s unnecessary?\u201dStill only silence replied him. Pretending to feel upset, Luo Jianqing sighed, and said with naughtiness hidden in his voice, \u201cwell, Master, if this time I dishonor Yu Xiao Peak, you cannot blame me for that. After all, it was you who didn\u2019t warn me about that, so I\u2026\u201d\u201cLuo Jianqing, do not dishonor our Yu Xiao Peak!\u201dThe voice was combined with Spiritual Power, and it hit Luo Jianqing right at his ears. Angry indeed, but it didn\u2019t hurt Luo Jianqing at all.Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t hold back his smile. These days\u2019 depression was finally relieved. He said, \u201calright, Master, I will compete on behalf of our sect, but I still want to know that if I do bring glories back, will there be any reward? For instance, how about opening the door? There is no need to open the postern for now. It\u2019s good enough if you can open the front door and\u2026 cough, cough, cough\u2026\u201dA sword light flew out from the house and knocked Luo Jianqing into the air. The disciple landed on the ground, still not hurt.\u201cNonsense!\u201dLuo Jianqing chuckled and walked towards the bamboo house. He whispered something in front of the gate then walked away. \u00a0Luo Jianqing asked Mo Qiu who was sitting at the Stone Pavilion to go downhill together with him. Mo Qiu didn\u2019t show a pleasant expression along the road. As soon as they got out of the Yu Xiao Peak, he asked Luo Jianqing directly, \u201cwhat were you guys talking about in secret?\u201dLuo Jianqing took a glance at him, \u201cI have no idea you are so interested in digging others\u2019 secrets.\u201dMo Qiu sniggered, \u201cNonsense! Do I look like that kind of person?\u201d\u201cThen why did you ask that question?\u201d\u201cThat was\u2026 because I care about you.\u201d\u201cWell, I am the one who have the right to decide whether to tell you or not. I prefer the latter option.\u201dMo Qiu, \u201c\u2026\u201dCang Shuang Peak wasn\u2019t far from Yu Xiao Peak. Soon, they saw the crowded cultivators who gathered together at the square of Cang Shuang Peak. The competition already got to the part among Foundation Establishment Period disciples. Two Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples immersed themselves into the rivalry. Though both of them didn\u2019t reach a high-level cultivation, their skills and abilities still amazed the audience.When Luo Jianqing arrived at the square, countless gazes fixed on him.Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples\u2019 eyes were kindling with admiration. Some of the Junior Sisters were even flushing. Many other common disciples were also fixing their eyes on Luo Jianqing with worship, as if they finally saw their idol. Suddenly, the audience were rippling with mumblings.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(II)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIs he the Great Senior Brother of Tai Hua Mountain? He is so handsome!\u201d\u201cI heard Luo Jianqing reached Nascent Soul Period before forty years old! My Master told me that there\u2019s a great chance for him to achieve Out-of-Body Period within twenty years!\u201d\u201cReally?! Out-of-Body Period? You got to be kidding me. The Elder of my sect just reached the Early-stage of Out-of-Body Period\u2026\u201d\u201cOh, come on! Master Xuan Lingzi who reached Nascent Soul Period at fifty-six achieved Deity Transformation Period before he was three hundred years old. It\u2019s totally reasonable for Brother Luo to get to the Out-of-Body Period at sixty!\u201d\u2026\u201cBrother, could you please do me a favor?\u201d\u201cHahaha, Junior Sister, of course! Anything, you name it, as long as I\u2019m capable to do it!\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 brother, I heard that you made many friends among Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples. Can you help me deliver this kerchief to Cultivator Luo?\u201d\u201c\u2026\u201d\u2026Because of the Superior Spiritual Bone, Luo Jianqing had extremely sharp hearing, plus his deep cultivation, he heard all of the mumblings among the audience. Mo Qiu was sitting beside Luo Jianqing, curious about all the things going on at this grand competition, but suddenly heard the young disciples\u2019 words. Mouth twitched, he complained, \u201cPeople obsessed with gossips are so annoying!\u201d\u201cHuh, now you know what I felt a moment ago.\u201d Luo Jianqing answered casually.At first, Mo Qiu didn\u2019t understand what Luo Jianqing was talking about, but he finally figured it out \u2013 he was critiquing him of asking that question! Mo Qiu won\u2019t keep silent, obviously, \u201cyou can\u2019t blame me for that! You and your Master are in that kind of \u00a0relationship, right? I\u2026 I\u2019m just curious!\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s heart twitched, \u201cwhat relationship?\u201dMo Qiu pondered a while then said, \u201cyou should ask yourself.\u201dLuo Jianqing kept quiet.The vibe suddenly turned awkward. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t say a word until the Gold Core Period disciples stepped into the ring, \u201cThe relationship between my master and I won\u2019t be accepted by the world. If you also think it sordid, you may as well leave Tai Hua Mountain after the competition. We should meet less frequently.\u201d\u201cYour word is not my command. It\u2019s no big deal falling in love with your Master. Sticking strictly with your so-called rules, as Dao Cultivator, you guys are so boring. Though the Fiend Cultivators had the rules regulating the \u2018abnormal\u2019 relationships, but no one really cares about it. In my Mo Dao Palace\u2026\u201d Mo Qiu stopped abruptly, then continued, \u201cthere are two friends of mine who are siblings, but they\u2019ve been together for thousands of years. They are even more closely related than you and your Master, but none of the Fiend Cultivators dares to point fingers at them. Master Xuan Lingzi is the top one cultivator in the world. Who dares to restrain him?\u201dLuo Jianqing looked down at the competition in the ring, \u201che will, he will restrain himself.\u201dMo Qiu didn\u2019t know what to respond.One hour later, the competitions among disciples under the stage of Gold Core Period came to an end. Unsurprisingly, the second Senior Brother of Tai Hua\u2019s Seven Children \u2013 Zuo Yunmo \u2013 defeated the third Senior Sister Wei Qiongyin once again and won the first place. Now, the next stage would be the competition of Nascent Soul Period disciples. Given that Luo Jianqing was the only cultivator who reached Nascent Soul Period among all these disciples, as long as no one challenged him, the championship would be his.The Elder who took charges in this event looked at Zuo Yunmo and asked, \u201cdo you want to challenge him?\u201dZuo Yunmo looked up at Luo Jianqing who sat at the bleachers, the latter nodded at him, smiling blandly.Zuo Yunmo turned his head and said, \u201cthe Great Senior Brother is such an excellent cultivator. I won\u2019t challenge him.\u201dLuo Jianqing lifted his eyebrow in surprise, and heard the Elder started to announce the results of the competition, \u201cnow, Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Grand Septennial Competition comes to an end. The first place of Qi Practicing Period is Lin Zhen of Cang Shuang Peak; the first place of Foundation Establishment Period is Yue Yunfeng of Bi Shen Peak; the first place of Gold Core Period is Zuo Yunmo of Cang Shuang Peak; the first place of Nascent Soul Period is Luo\u2026\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dSomeone suddenly shouted out and interrupted the Elder.The Elder turned his head to the audience and saw a young man wearing a white brocade robe stood up. Holding a jade folding fan in his hand, the young man smiled winsomely, \u201cI am Bai Chi, the seventh son of Bai Family. I am here to watch the competition as a representative of Bai Family. I have revered Tai Hua Mountain for a long time. When I arrived at the Tai Hua Mountain, the Sect Leader Sir Hao Xingzi welcomed us with hospitality and let us to take this place as home. Does that mean I can also take part in the competition?\u201dThe audience burst into an uproar!Things like this never happened in the past thousands of years!Tai Hua Mountain had stood on the Xuan Tian Continent for tens of thousands of years. At its prime time, Tai Hua Mountain reigned the continent with supreme dominance. However, thousand years ago, the fierce battle between humans and Demons had costed Tai Hua Mountain too much. Countless excellent disciples entered the gate of death. Even one of the Peak Master lost his life.All of the Four Sects and Eight Families developed within a thousand years. Among the eight, except the long-established Mo Family and Wei Family, the rest of the families can even be called \u2018young\u2019. However, the Bai Family already had three Da Sheng Period cultivators, and one of them had reached the Late-stage!The Four Sects were very powerful as well.Under this situation, although still being respected as the top-one sect, Tai Hua Mountain had lost its splendor, unable to dominant the continent as it did thousands of years ago.Though not offensive in words, what Bai Chi said was still a provocation. Nevertheless, as the \u00a0Master of Hao Ming Peak, Guang Lingzi burst into a laughter, \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s just a competition. You can challenge anyone you want to.\u201dBai Chi didn\u2019t expect Tai Hua Mountain would approve it without hesitation.Guang Lingzi looked at Luo Jianqing and asked him, \u201cJianqing, do you dare to take the challenge? I heard that this seventh son of Bai Family broke through Nascent Soul Period last year. I believe he won\u2019t bully the disciples who has lower cultivation level. He is deemed to rival with you.\u201dWith one sentence, Guang Lingzi set up the rules: it\u2019s totally fine to compete, as long as the rival you picked had higher cultivation level!Understanding everything, Luo Jianqing looked at Guang Lingzi and Hao Xingzi, then he stood up, \u201cI accept the challenge!\u201dHearing his words, Bai Chi smiled and flicked his hand fan, pointing at the ring, \u201cafter you!\u201dSeeing his rival acting like a gentleman, Luo Jianqing lifted an eyebrow and smiled. He flew up to the ring. The next moment, Bai Chi landed in front of him.Under the magnificent firmament, the Cang Shuang Peak stood among flocks of mountains, pointing at the sky. In the grand square of Ling Yun Palace, thousands of gazes fixed on the competition ring.Two white figures were standing in the center, facing each other. One of them was wearing a resplendent brocade robe, decorated with pearl-white jade. A thick jewelry belt hung on his waist. Even Bai Chi\u2019s hairpin was made by a hundred-years ice jade which could already be counted as a magical item.The other one, however, was wearing the simplest white robe with a simple white belt. Except the jade hairpin, the only other ornament on him was just a disciple tablet.Nonetheless, when Luo Jianqing stepped into the ring, even the sun was not that splendid as it should be. He drew everyone\u2019s attention immediately. Elegant and gorgeous, he was standing there, just like an incandescent painting.As for Bai Chi, who could be counted as one of the young celebrities on the Xuan Tian Continent. As the seventh son of Bai Family, he was ranked right after his elder brother Bai Ji in terms of cultivation. Usually, people would compliment him, appreciating his charm, but, today, he was nothing more than a background.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That Bai Chi has just reached the Nascent Soul Period for one year, while Brother Luo already maintained at Nascent Soul Period for two years.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too early to close the case. I heard that Bai Chi owns the second-best cultivation resources in Bai Family, which is only a slightest worse than Bai Family\u2019s Fourth Son. He has access to incredibly abundant cultivation resources and magic items.\u201d\u201cWhatever, Brother Luo is so handsome. I hope he will win!\u201dThe mumblings of discussion among the audience reached Bai Chi\u2019s ears. He tried to act in a composed and calm manner at first, but gradually his expression turned rigid. He drew out his spear and fixed his eyes on Luo Jianqing, while the latter was looking at him as well, smiling.The Judge Elder announced, \u201cthe competition begins!\u201dThe very next moment, Bai Chi brandished his spear and pierced towards Luo Jianqing. He moved so fast that the spear turned into several shadows. From the beginning, Bai Chi didn\u2019t reserve any of his strength, putting in all his efforts to attack his rival. The spear could barely be captured by eyes. Among all the Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples, only Zuo Yunmo and Wei Qiongyin were able to see through Bai Chi\u2019s movements, while the others only felt the ferocity of the fight.Blocking every possible way of avoidance, the shadows of spear pounced on Luo Jianqing. Each single pierce contained the power to deliver its enemy to the gate of death, but no one called a stop. There was Elders ready to cease the rival if necessary, ensuring the survival of the competitors. For now, it\u2019s time to do the best they can to win the contest.Using his toes touching the ground lightly, Luo Jianqing perfect avoided all the whacks from Bai Chi. Luo Jianqing wasn\u2019t in a rush. Just like wandering in a garden, Luo Jianqing was walking in the spear shadows with such calmness. There was no one that wasn\u2019t impressed.An Elder of a minor sect complimented, \u201cLuo Jianqing is worth to be called a legend. Achieving this level of Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Ping Zong Pace at this young age. Is that the second level of the Pace? Bravo! It\u2019s so brilliant!\u201d\u201cYes, indeed! Looks like he can achieve the third-level very soon!\u201dBai Chi kept piercing at Luo Jianiqng, while the latter kept dodging his attack like an uncatchable wind. After a while, Bai Chi was irritated. He connected his palm to the spear, generating the hand seal and casting spells on it. Suddenly; his weapon started to glint with jade-like color. The dark iron spear was shining splendidly, as if it\u2019s turned into a spear of white jade.Shocked, someone exclaimed, \u201cwhat happened to the spear?\u201dThe Bai Family\u2019s disciple was proud of the trick, \u201cthis is the Seven Spears of Bai Family. Brother Bai Chi had already mastered the third spear \u2013 White Snow Touches Plum Blossom!\u201dThe audience were impressed.In the contest ring, the white-jade spear was constantly spinning, summoning a whirlwind. Luo Jianqing\u2019s robe was waving along the tremendous gale. Flakes of petals gradually dropping down from the firmament, flower blossomed in the air but was covered by the overwhelming snow until there was nothing left except the endless whiteness.Boom!One spear, piercing blossom!Snow and plum blossom thrusted toward Luo Jianqing along with that stunning spear. Surprisingly, Luo Jianqing held his ground, didn\u2019t even have the slightest intention to dodge. Smiling, He watched the spear getting closer and closer. At the last moment, he suddenly lifted his hand, with two fingers holding tight together, and flicked.A beam of bice sword light crashed against the white jade spear.Bang! Bang! Bang!In an instant, all the snow and plum blossoms that once fulfilled the sky vanished. Bai Chi lost his weapon. The spear was knocked into the air and landed beside Bai Chi. The glint of the spear completely disappeared. What left was a gloomy steel. Bai Chi belched a mouthful of blood. He stepped back a few distances, nearly fell down.While Luo Jianqing flew up to the sky, landed in front of Bai Chi in a second.After spitting blood, Bai Chi didn\u2019t even realize what was going on. Before he could think of defense, a bice sword Qi emerged around his neck, almost touching his throat. He shivered, lifted his head in shock, and saw Luo Jianqing stood beside him. His rival was still smiling winsomely, \u201cCultivator Bai, you want to call it off or keep fighting?\u201dThere was complete silence in the square.The next moment, the audience burst out a blast of exclamation!\u201cLess than thirty minutes! Less than thirty minutes! Cultivator Luo only used a beam of sword light, and the Seventh Son of Bai Family was spitting out blood! That is so incredible!\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t use his sword!\u201d\u201cWhat? He didn\u2019t even draw his sword! Isn\u2019t that a solid prove that, though they are both at the Nascent Soul Period, Cultivator Luo could defeat the Seventh Son of Bai Family easily?\u201dHearing what the audience said, Bai Chi was so embarrassed that he couldn\u2019t help but shudder. He clenched his teeth, \u201cI will not surrender!\u201d\u201cOh,\u201d Luo Jianqing replied in a low voice. Bai Chi thought that Luo Jianqing was going to persuade him to admit his failure, but to his surprise, Luo Jianqing said, \u201cthen, I will beat you until you give in.\u201dBoom! Boom! Boom!Luo Jianqing hit Bai Chi at his belly and knocked him into the air. Before the poor lad even landed on the ground, Luo Jianqing had already flied to his side and lifted his leg \u2013 another merciless kick.On the bleachers, one of Bai Family\u2019s Elders stood up in rage, and roared, \u201chey! You! Show us some respect!\u201dHowever, before he could even finish his sentence, Luo Jianqing kicked Bai Chi right on his face, and knocked the latter out of the ring. Bai Chi already passed out and was quickly carried away by his family members. Luo Jianqing turned back to face the astonished judge, and beamed, \u201cElder, could you please announce the result?\u201dThe Elder finally found his tongue, \u201csure\u2026 sure! This competition, the winner is Luo Jianqing of Tai Hua\u2026\u201d\u201cOutrageous! Since you already win, why did you insist on embarrassing the son of our Bai Family publicly in the ring? I demanded you to stop. How dare you ignore me and still knocked him off? Does Bai Family look like a pushover to Tai Hua Mountain?!\u201dSending a Tribulation Passage Period Elder to watch the competition, Bai Family was indeed a family with solid strength. Normally, the Four Sects and Eight Families would only send Body Fusion Period Elders to attend the event, but this year was different. As if they\u2019ve made an agreement to give Tai Hua Mountain some pressure, this time, all of them sent Tribulation Passage Period Elders, and Duan Hun Sect even let a Da Sheng Period Elder to come as a representative!When the Elder of Bai Family finished, Yu Qingzi sneered, \u201cyou think that Tai Hua Mountain is weak enough to be judged by you guys?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Your Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciple was still beating Bai Chi even after he won! Where\u2019s Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s so-called fairness and justice?\u201dYu Qingzi slapped the table, \u201ctake back your words! Offensively challenging Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciple, Bai Chi asked for the whack!\u201d\u201cYu Qingzi! You\u2026\u201dOver the Xuan Tian Continent, usually there was such a small chance for someone to meet a high-level cultivator who had achieved Tribulation Passage Period cultivation. However, today on Tai Hua Mountain, a dozen of Tribulation Passage Period Cultivator gathered together, and two of them even started quarreling with each other. All the young disciples were watching the squabble with excitement kindling in their eyes. Luo Jianqing smiled reluctantly, and bowed down, \u201cRespected Master Yu Qingzi, it seems you forgot something \u2013 I didn\u2019t win at the first place.\u201dYu Qingzi wondered, \u201cbut you did kick Bai Chi off the ring, right?\u201dLuo Jianqing explained, \u201cwhat I mean is that I didn\u2019t win before I knock him off from the ring.\u201dThe Elder of Bai Family was enraged, \u201cNonsense! Everyone here saw that you\u2019ve defeated Bai Chi\u2019s Spear of White Snow Touches Plum Blossom! How do you explain that?!\u201dLuo Jianqing made an astonished look, \u201cbut, Elder, it was Bai Chi who said that \u2018he will not surrender\u2019!\u201dThe audience was shocked. After a while, someone whispered, \u201cyeah, I remembered that the Seventh Childe of Bai Family insisted to keep fighting.\u201d\u201cWhoa, Cultivator Luo is awesome. You know what, I didn\u2019t even give a damn to what Bai Chi said. That Bai Chi\u2026 wait, Bai Chi, Bai Chi? This name sounds like\u2026\u201d\u201cSounds like Idiot (In Chinese, Bai Chi was pronounced the same as\u00a0\u767d\u75f4\u00a0b\u00e1i ch\u012b, which means \u201cidiot\u201d)? Hahahahaha!\u201dMouth open, the Elder of Bai Family was speechless.Yu Qingzi burst into laughter with Guang Lingzi who sat beside her. This year, only three Peak Masters of Tai Hua Mountain attended the grand competition. Except the two who were laughing, Sir Hao Xingzi was touching his bear, siting at the First Seat elegantly as if he had no intention to join the quarrel. Hidden in the gaze he fixed on Luo Jianqing, there was nothing but praise.Luo Jianqing was no arrogant man, he bowed again, smiling blandly, \u201cif there\u2019s no other question, I will go back to my seat now.\u201d\u201cWait!\u201dOn the bleachers, a muscular man suddenly left his seat. His eagle-like eyes fixed on Luo Jianqing. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t hold his smile for long once he spotted that guy. Their gaze entangled with each other for quite long time, the man spoke, \u201cI am Yun Rong of Yun Family, ranking at the first among all the offspring of my family. I heard that Cultivator Luo took a great care of my younger sister in the Liu Yan Valley. Today, maybe I can have the honor to challenge Cultivator Luo?\u201dFinishing his sentences, Yun Rong flew up into the air and landed quietly in the competition ring. He never moved his bleak eyes away from Luo Jianqing, which made the later started to tense up.Before what happened in the Liu Yan Valley, on the Xuan Tian Continent there were four most famous geniuses of the young generation.Yan Su \u2013 the Senior Disciple of Duan Hun Sect; Yu Chen \u2013 the Buddha of Gui Yuan Sect; Bai Ji \u2013 the fourth son of Bai Family; and Yun Rong \u2013 the First Childe of Yun Family.All four of them were twenty-years older than Luo Jianqing, which means that they\u2019ve been cultivated for sixty years. There was a twenty-years difference in the time length of cultivation, so even if people were well aware that Luo Jinqing was the only other Superior Spiritual Bone in the world, the commoners still believed the four older ones were better than Luo Jianqing and they \u2013 being addressed as \u201cXuan Tian\u2019s Four Legends\u201d \u2013 were the actual top four of the young generation.That was what people believed until the battle of Liu Yan Valley in which Luo Jianqing fought with three other cultivators by himself. In that fight, Yan Su was one of his rivals. Moreover, Mo Qiu \u2013 as the offspring of the exiled Mo Family \u2013 made his name a well-known one as well. The two of them quickly became a legend after that battle. When heard the rumor saying Mo Qiu and Luo Jianqing might have died in the Liu Yan Valley, many cultivators felt that it was a great pity to lose such two promising raising stars. Now, since they got out of the Liu Yan Valley alive, their legend story sounded even more mysterious.Yun Rong shared little similarity with Bai Chi. He achieved the Nascent Soul Period eight years ago and was not the weakest one even among Xuan Tian\u2019s Four Legends. There was rumor saying that Bai Chi fought with Yun Rong once, and was defeated without even had the time to draw out his spear.Yun Rong stood on the fighting ground, \u201cCultivator Luo, be careful!\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled and nodded, \u201cplease!\u201dBoom!Within a blink, Luo Jianqing watched the world in front of him collapsing into pieces. The disciples on the bleachers all disappeared, even the Elders sitting in front of the Ling Yun Palace were gone as well. The magnificent Tai Hua Mountain vanished along the wind. The sky was dyed crimson. Clouds overcast the firmament on which snake-like lightning was meandering constantly.Luo Jianqing felt enormous pain from his own body. His left hand ached as if it was put into lava. He can feel no Spiritual Power from that hand \u2013 the spiritual vines were completely chopped off. Blood covered his eyes. The smell of blood came with every breath. Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help shivering, and he realized\u2026 his cultivation went back to the late-stage Gold Core Period.Wind was roaring along his ears. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t have the courage to lift his head, but heard a steady voice broke the wind and reached his ears, \u201cSenior Brother, you\u2019ve killed countless people. Brother Luo, this is the last time I call you \u201cbrother\u201d. You have fallen to fiend. You have killed Second Senior Brother and Sixth Senior Brother. Your sin is unforgivable, and your mistakes unamendable. Today, I give you a chance to end your life by yourself. If you do so, given that we\u2019ve been brothers, I shall ask the other cultivators to leave you a whole corpse.\u201dLuo Jianqing slowly lifted his head, and suddenly saw a bunch of people.Hundreds of cultivators surrounded him. Staring him with rage, every single one of them drew out their magic items. The leader was wearing a white robe of Tai Hua Mountain, with the disciple tablet of Yu Xiao Peak slung beside the waist. Sorrow displayed on his visage; Li Xiuchen was holding\u2026 a sword.Sharp and merciless, even when sheathed, that sword was still capable of shaking the heaven and the earth.Luo Jianqing stared at the sword and didn\u2019t utter a word.Li Xiuchen\u2019s patience was wearing down, \u201cLuo Jianqing, you still won\u2019t repent?!\u201dLuo Jianqing lifted his gaze and looked at him.That winsome face was profaned by dirt and blood, only the eyes were still glittering with his usual grace. Blood dyed Luo Jianqing\u2019s bice robe which billowed in the wind. Behind him was Duan Qing Cliff thousands of miles deep; before him was the righteous cultivators who chased him for ten days and ten nights. He watched all of these blankly. His lips trembled, but, as if there were mammoth amount of stone pressing on his throat, he didn\u2019t manage to speak.Li Xiuchen squinted, then suddenly drew out the sword.Once it was unsheathed, the wind stopped. The sword lightened up the cliff with its horrifying light.Li Xiuchen pointed at Luo Jianqing with the sword, and said harshly, \u201cLuo Jianqing, if this is your choice, then forgive me with what I\u2019m going to do. If there is a little good left in you, you should end your life right now, that way, the Xuan Ling Sword won\u2019t be tarnished by you!\u201dHoarse voice was uttered by Luo Jianqing, \u201cwhy\u2026 this sword?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(V)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis one sole sentence froze Luo Jianiqing, who felt like being thrown into an ice-age cave. His heart froze gradually. Every single breath brought bleakness into his vine. Blood overcast his sight. Endless despair thrived inside him. There was nothing left in him, but vast darkness and the last beam of light.He said hoarsely but still in a sturdy tone, \u201che asked you to\u2026 kill me!\u201dLi Xiuchen pondered for a moment, then said, \u201cMaster said, seeing this sword is the same as seeing him in person. After you end your life, I will bring your corpus back to Master, let him know that you already gave in, and will never dishonor our Yu Xiao Peak again!\u201d\u201cLi Xiuchen!\u201dThe last bit of light vanished with Li Xiuchen\u2019s words. Luo Jianqing collapsed, drowning in great sorrow. Luo Jianqing uttered a heart-broken moan. Drawing out Zhui Yin Sword which had already been broken into two parts, he dashed toward Li Xiuchen. His body was moribund, but he didn\u2019t give a damn, because nothing hurt more than the gash on his heart.The greatest sorrow came with a dying heart.They had known each other for forty years. They had lived together for forty years!He concealed his sordid thoughts for years. He became an excellent Great Senior Disciple of Tai Hua Mountain just for his Master! He never had a chance to be whom he wanted to be. He spent his whole life trying to be the Great Senior Brother of all the disciples on Tai Hua Mountain, to be a perfect Great Senior Disciple, to be Xuan Lingzi\u2019s disciple, to be\u2026No! He wasn\u2019t his disciple anymore.Now, his Master wanted him dead.Anguish devoured Luo Jianqing. His heart was torn into thousands of pieces, bleeding profusely. The last bit of thought that kept him alive, the hope that helped him to survive, was just being his Master\u2019s disciple and having a chance to look at his Master for just one glance, but now, what did he get?An asunder heart, and a will to obey his Master\u2019s last request!When Luo Jianqing got close to Li Xiuchen, he dropped Zhui Yin Sword that he had been gripped so hardly.Zhui Yin let out a panic sword cry, but Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t want to fight anymore.Zhui Yin, Zhui Yin (Xuan Lingzi\u2019s mortal name \u201cWu Yin\u201d means \u201cno sound\u201d in Chinese, while \u201cZhui Yin\u201d in Chinese means \u201cchasing sound\u201d)! He\u2019s been chasing sound for decades. It was a tiring chase. He was so tired to lift his fingers; he was so tired to speak; he was so tired to keep chasing. Why kept doing it? Given that he was destined to chase in vain, given that his Master was deemed to abandon him, what was the purpose of holding Zhui Yin in his hand?Without a slightest hesitation and led by Li Xiuchen, Xuan Ling Sword stabbed at Luo Jianqing\u2019s chest in a sudden.Luo Jianqing gave up defense completely. He smiled, and slowly closed his eyelids. The tip of Xuan Ling Sword touched his skin, with icy bleakness froze Luo Jianqing\u2019s flesh and vines. Trivial things in their daily life started to reemerge in his mind: when he was little, his Master held him in his arms while he fell asleep; when he grew up, his Master strictly criticized him when he made mistakes; when his Master started to keep distance from him; when he hid in his own house and watched his Master putting all his efforts in teaching Li Xiuchen.Xuan Ling Sword slowly pierced in his chest.The sound of slicing flesh was thumping in his head, incredible loud.\u201cDon\u2019t dishonor our Yu Xiao Peak.\u201d\u201cYou are the Great Senior Brother. If you don\u2019t cultivate hard, you are not qualified enough to lead your brothers and sisters!\u201d\u201cYou become so full of yourself with so little achievement? Jianqing, I am so disappointed.\u201d\u2026\u201c\u2026Jianqing, be careful.\u201dThe last sentence reached Luo Jianqing\u2019s ears in a soft caring tone, as if the speaker was holding back tremendous emotions.Luo Jianqing suddenly opened his eyes. The Xuan Ling Sword had already stabbed in half an inch. Diabolic expression appeared on Li Xiuchen\u2019s face. Seeing Luo Jianqing\u2019s awakening, he pounced fiercely toward Luo Jianqing, but incandescent bice light suddenly glittered between Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyebrows, where a four-petaled lotus gradually emerged.The next moment, an intact Floating Frost Sword appeared in Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand.\u201cThis is my Internal Demon, but all has changed in this life! Mirage, break!\u201dSword Light radiated out from the Floating Frost Sword. An elegant bice lotus suddenly bloomed with vast Spiritual Power, attacking Li Xiuchen. The latter let out a painful scream and dispersed in the air. The wind-roaring cliff vanished as well.In a blink, Luo Jianqing was delivered back to the competition ring.In front of him, Yun Rong belched out a mouthful of blood, face pale like paper, reeling back a few steps and falling onto the ground. Nobody could believe that this seemingly careless man was a genius sorcerer!Although Yun Rong practiced Yun Family\u2019s sword patterns as well, his main weapon was his formidable mental power. The reason why Bai Chi was defeated by Yun Rong even before he could draw out his spear was that he was trapped in the mirage at the very beginning of their fight.Yun Rong was slightly trembling. He wiped out the blood seeping out from his mouth and asked in a husky voice, \u201cyou were trapped by my mirage, then why\u2026\u201dSeveral droplets of blood were oozing from Luo Jianqing\u2019s chest as well. Though the stab happened in the mirage, as long as Luo Jianqing believed it was truly happening, the harm could be reflected in reality. This was Yun Rong\u2019s unique Mirage Shadow Kill.Luo Jianqing cleaned the seeping blood at the corner of his mouth and fixed his eyes on Yun Rong, \u201cbecause, something is really different.\u201dThis time, Luo Jianqing drew out the Floating Frost Sword, looking at his opponent with serious expression. He sighed softly, \u201cthank you for letting me see what was buried deep down in my heart and confirm my belief in Dao. You are a respectful rival who deserves me to defeat you with an unsheathed sword.\u201dWith incredible brilliance, the Floating Frost Sword was brandished toward Yun Rong. The Sword Shadow formed a bice lotus in the air, graceful but formidably lethal. Yun Rong immediately drew out his sword to defend, using Yun Family\u2019s Heaven Phoenix Jade Kill, but he still spat out a mouthful of blood and was knocked out of the competition ring.Inside the ring, Luo Jianqing stood at the center, elegantly. He was just standing there, but nobody dared to breath.He waved his sword slightly, then a sword gash was carved on the ring ground. Luo Jianqing lifted his gaze. Eyes shrinking and voice condensed, his words thumped in everyone\u2019s ears, \u201cNow, I stand here as the Great Senior Disciple of Tai Hua Mountain, who dares challenge me!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 75": "Chapter 75 - How Dare You Practice Possession! (I)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Jianqing spoke with tremendous power. His thunderous words shook everyone to the core.Silence fell on the edgeless competition ring. Maybe it was because that Luo Jianqing defeated all of his rivals in just a blink, even the Elders who was sitting in front of the Ling Yun Palace was unable to utter a single word.They were all at the Nascent Soul Period. Bai Chi had cultivated for seventy years; Yun Rong used seventy years as well, while Luo Jianqing only spent forty years to reach this level. The difference of their cultivation length didn\u2019t provide Yun Rong and Bai Chi the slightest advantage when fighting with Luo Jianiqng, not to mention the Seventh Childe of Bai Family didn\u2019t even make Luo Jianqing draw his sword!Luo Jianqing was way better than them.On the bleachers, Ming Hua Fairy of Fei Hua Sect lowered her head and sighed. She was there when several years ago Luo Jianqing and the other young cultivators had a fight in the Liu Yan Valley. Ming Hua was the Second Senior Disciple of the Fei Hua Sect, ranked right after her twin sister \u2013 Miao Yin Fairy \u2013 who insisted coming to Tai Hua Mountain to \u201cpolitely\u201d talk with the Elders about the fight, but was refused by Ming Hua. For what she had seen, Ming Hua thought, that was a wise decision.Gui Yuan Sect was the Buddha Sect among the Four Sects. Fo Zi Yu Chen \u2013 one of Xuan Tian\u2019s Four Legends \u2013 belonged to Gui Yuan Sect as a disciple. This time, Yu Chen didn\u2019t come to watch the competition, but his younger brothers, after seeing Luo Jianqing stood there incandescently, all mumbled \u201cAmitabha\u201d and sighed, \u201ccompared to Senior Brother Fo Zi, Cultivator Luo is probably\u2026 better.\u201dThe last one of the Four Sects \u2013 Shen Jian Sect \u2013 was standing on Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s side all the time. It was the weakest sect, but it was the only pure Dao Sect.As for those from Bai Family and Yun Family who was horribly embarrassed, some of the older members even left the square, but there were still some young disciples waiting there desperately for one man to help them revenge.That man was, of course, Yan Su.Duan Hun Sect, the assemble of all the Ghost Cultivators in the world, was a shrine of the Ghost cultivators.One had to be much favored by destiny to be a Ghost Cultivator. Not every ghost can be a Ghost Cultivator, but almost all the Ghost Cultivators were very talented and unbelievably determined.Among Xuan Tian\u2019s Four Legends, Yun Rong was a gifted sorcerer; Bai Ji was a born genius, and he also took advantages of Family\u2019s cultivation resources; Fo Zi Yu Chen cultivated on karma and was praised by his profound knowledge of dharma. All three of them were worth the title of \u201cLegend\u201d. No one could ever rank them from top to bottom, but there\u2019s still a fact that everyone acquiesced: the most powerful one of Xuan Tian\u2019s Four Legend was no one else but Yan Su.After he got out of the Liu Yan Valley, Yan Su went to the forbidden place of Duan Hun Sect and went through Closed Door training for five years.There were rumors about the forbidden place, saying that it contained tens of thousands of ghosts. Once entering it, one had to endure the heart-tearing pain caused by countless ghosts chewing one\u2019s heart. The common Dao Cultivator couldn\u2019t bear staying there for thirty minutes. Normal Ghost Cultivator could only stand for a few days. Yan Su, however, cultivated in there for a total of five years. He came out of the forbidden place with an already-reached Nascent Soul Period, then defeated his old rival \u2013 Fo Zi Yu Chen \u2013 in a complete victory.Luo Jianqing heard Xie Zizhuo talking about this. His younger brother told him that before Yan Su and Fo Zi Yu Chen even started the fight, the latter stood there with folded hands and said, \u201cLife is a theatre. You can stand on the stage for now, and immerge into the audience in a blink. Difference may look great, but I hold both the same. Thus, no delight; no complaint. I cannot deliver you from torment. Nonetheless, suffering awaits, why not convert?\u201dFo Zi surrendered even before the rivalry could start.Now, Bai Family and Yun Family put all their hopes on Duan Huan Sect\u2019s Yan Su, who was sitting on the bleachers with an overcast expression. He fixed his eyes on Luo Jianqing, not letting loose for one second.Bai Chi was indeed embarrassed by Luo Jianqing and was even called an \u201cidiot\u201d by many from the audience. Bai Family was badly ashamed. Therefore, some of Bai Family\u2019s young disciples started to mumble Yan Su\u2019s name, hoping he could dampen Luo Jianqing\u2019s pride.However, Yan Su was just sitting there and didn\u2019t say anything.Luo Jianqing knew what happened today won\u2019t end this easily. Beaming winsomely, he lifted his eyes and looked at Yan Su, \u201cCultivator Yan, do you want to join the Grand Competition of Tai Hua Mountain?\u201dYan Su heard his words, raised up his head and stared at Luo Jianqing, with a bloodcurdling look in his eyes.Their eyes met, as if lightning were whipping the air. Yan Su said, \u201cNo. Several days ago, I happened to break through the middle-stage of Nascent Soul Period. Sir Guang Lingzi set the rule that one cannot challenge someone who is at a lower cultivation level. Therefore, if I really bully you today, our Duan Hun Sect won\u2019t enjoy the victory but endure others\u2019 humiliation.\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s pupils shrunk.Yan Su\u2019s words caused an uproar among the audience.\u201cNo way! Yan Su already reached middle-stage of Nascent Soul Period?! It\u2019s only four years since he achieved Nascent Soul Period. Yun Rong already stayed at the early-stage for eight years and hasn\u2019t made much progress!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m shocked! Middle-stage Nascent Soul Period at sixty-seven years old! He was only four years later than Xuan Lingzi, the most powerful cultivator of all!\u201d\u201cI finally know why Fo Zi didn\u2019t dare to fight with Yan Su. He knew Yan Su was much more powerful than him!\u201dEarly and middle stage Nascent Soul Period didn\u2019t have a significant difference. Except people like Luo Jianqing who was born with keen Spiritual Sense, only Elders who had reached Tribulation Passage Period could sense the difference. At first, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t pay attention to Yan Su\u2019s cultivation base, but discovered it right after Yan Su pointed that out.Fingers clenched tightly to hold the Floating Frost Sword, Luo Jianqing suddenly asked, \u201cThen, dare you challenge me?\u201dHearing the provocation, Yan Su stood up, obviously irritated, \u201cI don\u2019t want to bully you. How dare you still bring that up?!\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled, then said in a calm tone, \u201cThen, Cultivator Yan, today, I will challenge you. Do you dare accept the challenge?\u201d\u201cOf course!\u201d A cast of shadow glinted in Yan Su\u2019s eyes. He jumped into the air and landed in the competition ring.In front of Ling Yun Palace, Yu Qingzi frowned, \u201cWhat happened to Jianqing? He is not a pugnacious person. Why is he challenging the others today? He already brought honor to Tai Hua Mountain. Even if he doesn\u2019t fight with Yan Su, Tai Hua Mountain will still be praised and admired because of what happened during this year\u2019s Grand Septennial Competition.\u201dGuang Lingzi thought about it for a while and said, \u201cMaybe Jianqing has the confidence to defeat Yan Su?\u201dYu Qingzi shook her head, \u201cStill, this is not a wise decision. When he just reached the early-stage Nascent Soul Period, Yan Su was able to make Gui Yuan Sect\u2019s Fo Zi surrender. Now he\u2019s achieved the middle-stage. There\u2019s no doubt that he is more powerful than before. Jianqing is making a bold move.\u201dIn the competition ring, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t hear Yu Qingzi\u2019s complaint.He unsheathed Floating Frost Sword and pointed it at Yan Su. Seeing this, the latter turned serious and took out his Ghost Axe.When Yan Su\u2019s weapon was out, the sky was suddenly overcast.Screaming and crying of the ghosts filled the world.\u201cThe competition\u2026 Begins!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76 - How Dare You Practice Possession! (II)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBoom!Overwhelming Ghost Qi was dispersed from the Ghost Axe. Along with that, thousands of ghosts were released, constantly crying and groaning. They kept making unbearable high-pitch screams which forced many of the lower-level disciples to cover their ears to ease the pain. Still, several Qi Condensation Period disciples had bleeding ears.Seeing this, one of the Elders of Tai Hua Mountain flicked his sleeve and reinforced the ward.The sky was covered completely by the gloomy Ghosts, which looked horrifying. Wearing black from head to toe, dark as night, Yan Su was staring at Luo Jianqing in an ice-cold gaze. Lime will-o\u2019-the-wisp was kindling in his eyes, as if he was transformed into a real ghost. His figure reflected in Luo Jianqing\u2019s pupils, like an infernal devil.\u201cI don\u2019t want to be a bully. Luo Jianqing, after you!\u201dLuo Jianqing didn\u2019t waste the given opportunity. Holding Floating Frost in his right hand, he struck with a shred of Sword Qi. Dozens of ghosts twined it up and consumed the Sword Qi in satisfaction. Yan Su burst out in laughter, \u201cSo, this is your tactic? Come on, Luo Jianqing, after the fight of Liu Yan Valley, now you are disappointing me. Take this!\u201dThen he suddenly attacked with his axe.Immediately, the wind roared, and the temperature dropped drastically. Countless ghosts pounced on Luo Jianqing with rage. However, the latter didn\u2019t show any signs of flurry. Instead, with fingertips gently touching the sword, he drew a seal on Floating Frost. A bice delicate pattern emerged from the blade, glittering steadily. Compared to that diabolic flock of ghosts, Luo Jianqing\u2019s sword light was extremely tender.Luo Jianqing squinted, \u201cAttack!\u201dVast of bice sword light rippled out like waves. Once the ghosts touched the sword light, they were unable to push forward no matter how loud they screamed. They met at the center of the ring and underwent a tug-of-war. None of them was willing to take a step back.After a while, the sword light scattered into pieces and the ghosts flew back into the Ghost Axe.Yan Su\u2019s eyes squinted. He operated a hand seal and infused the power into the axe.\u201cNine realms of inferno, blasts into oblivion; thousands of enmity souls, condemned byYama!\u201dThe gigantic axe pointed straightly at Luo Jianqing and formed a horrifying black skull in the air. If one looked closely, one could find that the skull was composed of tens of thousands of ghosts, each one of them was crying for their grievance. Mammoth enmity and endless Ghost Qi was infused into the skull, making it even more terrifying.Duan Hun Sect\u2019s Elder laughed, \u201cHahaha, I\u2019m not exaggerating. Yan Su came out of the Thousand Ghosts Cave with ten thousand ghosts perfectly tamed by him. Able to refine this Nine Infernos Enmity Axe at middle-stage Nascent Soul Period, he is indeed a genius. Losing to such a legendary Ghost Cultivator, Luo Jianqing of Tai Hua Mountain shouldn\u2019t have anything to complain!\u201dHearing this, Sir Guang Lingzi pounded the desk, \u201cWho told you that creepy guy\u2019s gonna win?\u201dDuan Huan Sect\u2019s Elder sneered, \u201cGuang Lingzi, it has been fifty years since we last met. You are still so irritable. Once gashed by the Nine Infernos Enmity Axe, your Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciple will definitely be badly wounded. Not only physically, but also his soul will be whacked. You\u2019d better keep an eye on that disciple. That way, maybe you still have a chance to save him.\u201d\u201cOpen your dim-sighted eyes and look carefully! How come a tiny axe can be compared with Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record?\u201dShocked, the Duan Hun Sect\u2019s Elder quickly looked towards the competition ring. In the center of the ring, the Ghost Qi already filled the whole place. Luo Jianqing stood in a corner as if the black Ghost Qi left him nowhere to escape.Luo Jianqing sighed lightly, and said, \u201cSo, Cultivator Yan, this is your Final Kill?\u201dYan Su replied in a frozen tone, \u201cYou still have time to give in.\u201dLuo Jianqing said, \u201cI finally figured out why Fo Zi told you \u2018Difference may look great, but I hold both the same. Thus, no delight; no complaint\u2019. Ghost Cultivator is also a ghost. These overwhelming enmities might be a Final Kill of you, but, have you ever thought about the consequence of using them? When facing karma, how \u2013 do you think \u2013 the owner of these enmities will repay you?\u201dYan Su replied, \u201cWhy should I care about them, huh? Once entering the Thousand Ghosts Cave, the ghost soul will never be innocent again. I endured the heart-tearing pain, and they became my slaves, obeying my command! This is the true karma!\u201d\u201cCultivator Yan, suffering awaits, why not convert?\u201d\u201cFor me, suffering is the necessity of cultivation!\u201dLuo Jianqing squinted, then suddenly pounded his sword and let it float in front of his eyes. The teal sword light glittered on Floating Frost Sword. Luo Jianqing stared at it grimly in silence. After a moment, he started to operate hand seal. His fingers danced in the air, quickly as a blurry figure, at the same time, formidable coercive power began to condense on Floating Frost.Boom!Sky was overcast in which countless lightning writhing in the clouds.Luo Jianqing\u2019s pupils shrunk, \u201cGather!\u201dImmediately, a thick pillar-like thunderbolt smashed on the Floating Frost Sword, which, in an instant, was glowing splendidly. Luo Jianqing sealed hand signs single-handedly, pointing at the firmament. He took a leap into the sky, along with him, the Floating Frost Sword gradually hovered and turned, eventually parallel to the ground.This seemingly simple sword was pointing at Yan Su silently.As if he was sighing, Luo Jianqing mumbled some words in a mild voice. Nobody heard what he said, but the sword light of Floating Frost skyrocketed in a blink. The power of thunder and lightning was infused in it. Magnificent like a mountain peak, the sword took a strike forward without any hesitation.\u201cNine Infernos Enmity Axe!\u201d\u201cBlossom Lotus Sword!\u201dBang!The moment that the sword and the axe collided, time ceased. The sky was filled by blinding white light.Outside the competition ring, the Out-of-Body Period Elder who took charge in the ward was in shock. Using every bit of his Spiritual Power, he quickly sealed a hand sign and set up a ward. On the bleachers, all of the disciples watched this brilliant rivalry with eyes wide opened, didn\u2019t want to waste a single second on blinking their eyes.After a while, the light gradually disappeared. Little by little, the scene in the ring could be seen by the audience again. The ground of competition ring was destroyed into bits. On one side of the ring, Yan Su was lying in a pile of broken stone, hand pressed against his chest; on the other side, the elegant cultivator dressed in blue propped his body against the sword and spat out a mouthful of blood.There was silence at first, then, the audience burst out in hurrah and applause!\u201cBrother Luo wins! Brother Luo wins!\u201d\u201cYan Su was defeated, \u2018Xuan Tian\u2019s Four Legends\u2019 need a new name!\u201d\u201cCultivator Luo is so brilliant!\u201dThe Fiend Cultivator in scarlet was finally relieved. He chuckled, \u201cHmm, not bad. If you lose, you\u2019re not worthy to be my friend-of-life-and-death.\u201dRight now, Luo Jianqing was already overdrawn, and he could hardly move even a little. There was no Spiritual Power left for him to use. He was using all of his strength to standstraight.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77 - How Dare You Practice Possession! (III)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayBoth of Luo Jianqing and Yan Su knew that their abilities were virtually the same, and because of that, after the first few attempts, they gave it all to the final attack. Blossom Lotus Sword was a Nascent-Soul-Period maneuver recorded on True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record. Luo Jianqing had never used it in the past. However, carrying out this sword maneuver was like putting his Spiritual Power into a black hole \u2013 Blossom Lotus Sword was an unimaginably vast depletion of Spiritual Power.Nevertheless, he didn\u2019t do it all in vain. He had won the contest and kept his word \u2013 he promised Xuan Lingzi that he would bring honor to Yu Xiao Peak.Speechless, the Judge stared at the devastated competition ring. After a long silence, he finally found back his mind, \u201cthe rivalry ends, and the winner is Luo Jianqing of Tai Hua Mountain\u2026\u201d\u201cI can keep fighting!\u201d Yan Su yelled in a hoarse voice.He was trying hard to stand up but reeled and fell down helplessly. Luo Jianqing watched him trying to get up over and over again when the Judge wanted to announce the winner. Every single time, Yan Su requested for continuance of the rivalry, but never did he stand up again.At this moment, Yan Su looked more like a tragic hero. Even many of those who originally didn\u2019t like the ghastly Ghost Cultivator started to have sympathy for him. This, probably, was the helplessness of being a genius and encountering an even more brilliant guy. He is doomed to be outshined by the other.This time, even Luo Jianqing was touched, and then changed his impression of Yan Su.However, when the ninth time Yan Su failed to stand on his feet, he suddenly started shivering drastically, his face twisted diabolically. The next moment, he pounced the stone pile with tremendous strength and people thought he was just abreacting his indignation. Even the Elders sitting in front of the Ling Yun Palace didn\u2019t sense a slightest anomaly. Nonetheless, under the scattered stones, streaks of dark power were skulking in lightning speed, approaching Luo Jianqing like writhing snakes.On the bleachers, Mo Qiu suddenly stood up and shouted, \u201cYou bastard! Stop it!\u201dA beam of scarlet light rushed to the competition ring.At the same time, Hao Xingzi and Guang Lingzi quickly figured out what was happening, \u201cTyke! How dare you!?\u201dLuo Jianqing was thrilled. His vigilance urged him to move backwards with his exhausted body, and from where he originally stood, boom, a black ghost snake broke the ground and pounced towards Luo Jianqing.Hao Xingzi, who had the highest cultivation level among all the cultivators who were presented here, responded at once, but still was left behind by the ghost snake. Right before the snake bit Luo Jianqing, a bloody scourge came out from nowhere and strapped the snake, which was torn asunder in an instant.Mo Qiu stepped on the competition ring and pulled Luo Jianqing to him using his scourge. Rage flaming in his eyes, he stared at Yan Su who was lying on the ground, \u201chow dare you succumbed to your Internal Demons and operate Possession!? Under the nose of all these high-level cultivators, surely you wouldn\u2019t make it, but you are already unforgivable with that thought in mind!\u201dNow, Luo Jianqing had regained some strength. He freed himself from Mo Qiu\u2019s protection and fixed his eyes on Yan Su bleakly, \u201cCultivator Yan, when did you give in to your Internal Demons?\u201dBefore Yan Su could answer his question, Hao Xingzi\u2019s penetrating voice sounded, \u201cA devil thought leads to the formation of a Demon! Duan Hun Sect, we won\u2019t let this matter go easily. The Great Senior Disciple of Duan Hun Sect succumbed to Internal Demons and even attempted to Possession! Once the ghost snake goes into Luo Jianqing\u2019s body, his soul will be wounded and tortured incontestably. Do you even have the gut to take that responsibility?!\u201dSpeechless, the Elder of Duan Hun Sect was stunned.There were only three Da Sheng Period cultivator presented at the grand square \u2013 Hao Xingzi, Guang Lingzi, and this Elder of Duan Hun Sect. The Elder thought about many possibilities of the ending of the rivalry when he was watching it, but seeing Yan Su succumbing to Internal Demons and trying to Possession was definitely not included in them.Eyes gleaming with astuteness, the Elder quickly lifted his hand and drew Yan Su to his side, \u201csurely, Duan Hun Sect will give Tai Hua Mountain a proper explanation. Yan Su was just too stubborn to accept his failure. He didn\u2019t mean it. Besides, it wasn\u2019t long since he deviated; there\u2019s still hope for him to recover.\u201dGuang Lingzi had had enough of this, \u201cBullshit! If the ghost snake wasn\u2019t trapped by this scarlet-robed young cultivator but instead hurt our disciple\u2019s soul \u2013 you can\u2019t afford to let it happen!\u201dThe Elder of Duan Hun Sect knew this was entirely Yan Su\u2019s fault, but still, he insisted, \u201cI need to go back to my sect and talk about it with our Grand Master\u2026\u201dYu Qingzi sneered, \u201cThere\u2019s only one thing you need to know: Tai Hua Mountain won\u2019t let disciples be bullied by others, ever. Oh, and I don\u2019t need to remind you who is Jianqing\u2019s Master.\u201dThe Elder lost control of his facial expression and cursed Yan Su in his mind for thousands of times. Nevertheless, he knew that Yan Su was a rarely-seen superior Ghost Cultivator. There\u2019s still ways to pull him back from the Internal Demons.Pondering the situation, the Elder suddenly lifted his gaze and fixed his eyes on Mo Qiu, \u201cI have no idea when Tai Hua Mountain recruited such a legendary disciple who has acute Spiritual Sense which is as excellent as that of Da Sheng Period Cultivator! Not even in your seventies, huh? But he already reached the late-stage Nascent Soul Period, not to mention he is so sensitive to Fiend Power\u2026\u201dYu Qingzi stared at the Elder, \u201cGeezer, what are you trying to say!?\u201dThe Elder pounded the desk, \u201cOld witch, you dare say that again?!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201d\u201cYou!\u201dNone of them were willing to stop the quarrel first. One third of his Spiritual Power recovered, Luo Jianqing looked at Mo Qiu with gratitude kindling in his eyes, then said, \u201cRespected Master, this is my friend \u2013 Mo Qiu, who was a descendent of Mo Family. We got to know each other in the Liu Yan Valley. He once fought with Ming Hua Fairy of Fei Hua Sect and Bai Chi of Bai Family. Ask a random commoner, they all know this.\u201dHearing this, Ming Hua Fairy stood up and saluted, smiled blandly, \u201cYes, indeed. I do know this Cultivator Mo.\u201dThe Elder of Mo Family stood up as well, \u201cAlthough Mo Qiu haven\u2019t put down his name on Mo Family\u2019s Lineage Record, he is a descendent of whom was exiled to the Northern Waste Land from the Mo Family.\u201dDuan Hun Sect\u2019s Elder said, \u201cSo what? A young man with a just-so-so Spiritual Bone reaches the late-stage Nascent Soul Period within seventy years and is so sensitive to Fiend Power. I highly doubt his identity. We should\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d Hao Xingzi reprimanded him, and the latter shut his mouth up, \u201cIf you want to say that this Cultivator Mo is a Fiend Cultivator, save your breath. You know this already \u2013 any Fiend Cultivator who has reached cultivation level beyond Nascent Soul Period can never hide their Fiend Power. Several years ago in the Liu Yan Valley, Cultivator Mo was just late-stage Cold Core Period, there was still that possibility, but now he has achieved late-stage Nascent Soul Period. He is clear, undoubtedly. Duan Hun Sect, don\u2019t be so full of yourself! Do not forget who left their names on that piece of paper hundreds of years ago!\u201dThe Elder could not find any word to quibble anymore.All of the high-level cultivators knew that it was Xuan Lingzi and Fiend Exalt \u2013 Mo Qianqiu \u2013 who signed the contract with the Four Demon Exalts, exchanging their freedom for the peaceful life of all human beings. Xuan Lingzi was confined to Tai Hua Mountain since then, and Mo Qianqiu was restricted within the Fiend Palace which stood at the boundary of human and demon continents. Not to mention the Fiend Exalt, Xuan Lingzi himself had already made tremendous sacrifice to the whole Human Clan. The common high-level cultivators owed a lot to Xuan Lingzi and Mo Qianqiu.This farce ended with Hao Xingzi\u2019s rebuke.Duan Hun Sect\u2019s Elder brought Yan Su back and left Tai Hua Mountain immediately, promised to give them a satisfactory explanation.This year\u2019s Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Grand Competition, Luo Jianqing reaped victory when facing two of Xuan Tian\u2019s Four Legends and beaten up the seventh Childe of Bai Family easily. He made his fame through the rivalries. At the same time, Mo Qiu, who, with low-grade Spiritual Bone, reached late-stage Nascent Soul Period within seventy years, and sensed the Fiend Cultivator before the other thousands of cultivators even noticed it. He quickly became well-known.When two of them stood together, one could only compliment that they were truly two splendid raising stars. Others even came up with a title for them.\u201cThey are whom far more legendary than Xuan Tian\u2019s Four Legends: Luo River Thousand Autumn (\u2018Qiu\u2019, from \u2018Mo Qiu\u2019, means Autumn in Chinese)!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(I)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAfter the Grand Competition ended, Zuo Yunmo \u2013 along with other Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Elders \u2013 stayed at the Cang Shuang Peak to entertain the guests from other sects and clans, while Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu entered the gate of Ling Yun Palace. Mo Qiu was loath to come in at first, but Luo Jianqing whispered to him, \u201cRelax, even my Master didn\u2019t sense it. Probably Sir Hao Xingzi just wants to ask something about you.\u201dReluctantly, Mo Qiu stepped into the Ling Yun Palace.Inside the Palace, Hao Xingzi praised Luo Jianqing for the honors he brought to Tai Hua Mountain and gave him lots of Magical Items as rewards, which, even included an Earth-level Flying Boat. Hao Xingzi\u2019s delight cannot be seen if only one was blind, but at last, he asked Luo Jianqing a question. \u201cJianqing, there is one thing I am still confused: why did you insist challenging Yan Su?\u201dDefeating Yan Su was definitely a good thing, for the winner\u2019s name would be praised all over the Xuan Tian Continent, but, still, nobody would blame Luo Jianqing at all if he didn\u2019t challenge Yan Su.Hearing the question, Luo Jianqing bowed down politely and saluted with his hands folded together, \u201cRespected Master, this is all about a promise I made with my Master.\u201dSir Hao Xingzi uttered a curious \u201coh?\u201d immediately, while Mo Qiu looked at Luo Jianqing with astonishment. However, Hao Xingzi asked no more about it so Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t say anything. Nobody knew what the promise was all about. Silently, Mo Qiu thought to himself, it was such a pity.Then, Sir Hao Xingzi finally set his eyes on Mo Qiu. In just a blink, tremendous amount of Da-Sheng-Level coercion pressed on Mo Qiu\u2019s shoulder like a colossal mountain. The latter wasn\u2019t expecting this. He uttered a groan and reeled; his feet sunk into the floor for half cun (a traditional Chinese unit of length. Its traditional measure is the width of a person\u2019s thumb at the knuckle).Realizeing what was going on, Luo Jianqing was shocked, \u201cRespected Master, you are\u2026\u201dSir Hao Xingzi withdrew the coercion and laughed, \u201cIndeed, you own a very rarely-seen Body of Spiritual God. I have only met a few cultivators in my whole life who have comparable Mental Power as terrific as yours. There is a hearsay that a unique corporeity exists in this world, which is called the Body of Spiritual God. These kinds of people were born with a mighty soul that none of the same-level cultivators can match with. Naturally, they also have sharp Spiritual Sense. Today, you were the first one who sensed Yan Su\u2019s Fiend Qi, and your Body of Spiritual God might be the reason.\u201dTurning his head to look at Mo Qiu, Luo Jianqing was stunned by Hao Xingzi\u2019s words.Only him, Mo Qiu, and Qing Kun knew the fact that Mo Qiu is a Fiend Cultivator. Even Xuan Lingzi wasn\u2019t aware about it. Before this, Luo Jianqing simply thought that, as a Fiend Cultivator, Mo Qiu should naturally be keen sensing Fiend Qi, but, judging from Sir Hao Xingzi\u2019s attitude, he realized that was not the case. Could it be\u2026 Mo Qiu truly had the Body of Spiritual God?The gorgeous Cultivator who dressed in scarlet replied emotionlessly, \u201cI see.\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dSeriously? So calm and cool?Sir Hao Xingzi wasn\u2019t expecting Mo Qiu\u2019s reaction to be like this: he was not asking feverishly what was the Body of Spiritual God, nor was he expressing any excitement. However, Hao Xingzi thought, Mo Qiu is a descendant of one of Mo Family\u2019s lineage which was exiled to the Northern Waste Land. For him, life is indeed tough. Perhaps, Hao Xingzi kept thinking, this young man was already a master on concealing emotions.Hao Xingzi felt that it was such a pity for Mo Qiu\u2019s belonging to the Mo Family. He could hardly find a proper reason to ask Mo Qiu to join Tai Hua Mountain as long as the Mo Family had the intention to keep him theirs. What Mo Qiu had accomplished in the competition ring was extremely marvelous. The Mo Family would not let him go even if he were not a late-stage Nascent Soul Period cultivator.Pondering over it, Sir Hao Xingzi gave Mo Qiu two Earth-level Magical items as gifts and appreciated his help, forming a good karma.The two young cultivators left the Ling Yun Palace, but before they could even leave the grand square, around four or five cultivators wearing brocade robe surrounded them. The leader of the unknown crowd was an elder with hoary hairs. He shot a piercing gaze at Mo Qiu for a long time, then finally spoke, \u201cI am the Seventh Elder of the Mo Family, whom, I believe, is your great great great granduncle.\u201dThat\u2019s how Mo Qiu was trapped.At first, the Mo Family wasn\u2019t paying much attention to Mo Qiu \u2013 just a nobody with low-graded Spiritual Bone who prolonged the time returning to the major lineage. Now, however, all was different. One Transcending Tribulation Period cultivators and three Body Fusion Period cultivators sieged Mo Qiu. Luo Jianqing chuckled and flew back to Yu Xiao Peak alone, leaving behind a troubled Mo Qiu and a sentence, \u201cSee you later!\u201d\u201cLuo Jianqing! Are you my friend or not?!\u201d Yelled Mo Qiu, irritated.Hearing Mo Qiu\u2019s complain, Luo Jianqing made a decision \u2013 speed up!Among the verdant, magnificent mountains, a wisp of bice light scudded over the firmament like a shining meteor, and landed in front of the gate of Yu Xiao Peak which stood at the very center of Tai Hua Mountain. The elegant cultivator in bice gently flicked his sleeve, then the ward guarding the mountain which was capable of killing a Da Sheng Period cultivator suddenly cracked, creating a gap for the young cultivator to enter.Luo Jianqing stepped on the ground of Yu Xiao Peak, crossing the thriving bamboo forest. He wasn\u2019t in a hurry at first, but the closer he got to the top of the mountain, the faster he marched. Finally, he put everything behind his mind and started flying in a lightning speed.At the end of the bamboo forest, Luo Jianqing was stunned when he saw a white figure standing there, gracefully.Bathed in the splendid sunshine, his Master was wearing a pearl-white robe, solemnly stood in front of his bamboo house. Folding his hands behind him, the cultivator in white was gazing at the edge of the azure sky, listening to the rustling of bamboo leaves when they were dancing with mild breeze. Dedicate golden patterns were rimmed on his sleeves. Soft wind touched his Master\u2019s face and stirred his night-dark hair.Luo Jianqing wasn\u2019t expecting to see his Master when he came back to the Yu Xiao Peak.He thought that his stubborn Master will still confine himself in that bamboo house. There was no way to tell when he would finally come out. Luo Jianqing already had himself prepared for the worst situation that he would not see his Master until he achieved Deity Transformation Period so that he could force his Master out of the house, then they would face those tedious etiquettes.Nevertheless, now, his Master had come out.Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind fell into a blank, still transfixed at the edge of the forest. Suddenly he was pulled by a colossal amount of power. In just a blink, he was brought close to Xuan Lingzi, face to face.If there was a door between them, Luo Jianqing had million words to pour out, but when he literally saw this man whom he yearned for days, he could feel his heart shivering with slightest fear.Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help butrevere their Master-disciple relationship which lasted for dozens of years. Fingertips trembling faintly, he failed to utter a single word, but Xuan Lingzi suddenly held his hand! Luo Jianqing was completely stunned.Xuan Lingzi asked him, \u201cis it true that you weren\u2019t hurt?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 79": "Chapter 79 - Jianiqng, I Like You & This is Not Couple Cultivation! (II)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Jianqing replied subconsciously, \u201cJust a scrape. Not a big deal.\u201dHe wasn\u2019t lying. Defeating Bai Chi was a piece of cake for him. He wasn\u2019t harmed at all. When competing with Yun Rong, he got stabbed right at the chest in the mirage. The tip of the sword sunk into his flesh for half inches. He bore the worst injuries when fighting with Yan Su. However, Yan Su was not the main reason he got injured, instead, he was mainly thumped by his own attack \u2013 Blossom Lotus Sword \u2013 in the final showdown, given that it was the first time he applied it in a real battle.With the help of Yu Qingzi, Luo Jianqing\u2019s wounds were almost healed. He just needed a good rest to be fully recovered.Nevertheless, Xuan Lingzi frowned, then softly connected his fingertips to Luo Jianqing\u2019s palm with index and middle fingers held together. Luo Jianqing immediately felt a refreshing spring of power piercing into his body through the Shaofu Acupoint, flowing along the vines all over his flesh.Being controlled precisely, the power stream brought Luo Jianqing gladdening relaxation without any harm. After flowing over all his meridians, it was drawn back out of his Shaofu Acupoint.As always, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s expression was detached and indifferent, but if you looked closer enough, you could find that his eyebrows were not knitted anymore. He told Luo Jianqing, \u201cPossession, no matter success or not, would definitely cause damage to the soul that is under attack, especially the Possession casted by the Fiend Cultivator. If it succeeds, original body owner\u2019s soul will be torn asunder, truly, a sordid cast.\u201dLuo Jianqing finally figured out what Xuan Lingzi was trying to say. A thought gleamed in his mind \u2013 the reason why his Master came out of seclusion was that he was aware of what he had been through during the competition, in other words, his Master was worried about him.Luo Jianqing\u2019s heart softened, and the gleam of fear which tethered tightly on it vanished immediately.Finishing the diagnosis, Xuan Lingzi tried to draw back his hand, disconnecting his fingers from Luo Jianqing\u2019s palm, but he was grabbed by Luo Jianqing unexpectedly. Transfixed, Xuan Lingzi looked at his disciple with astonishment. Under the vert forest, the young cultivator was smiling winsomely. Luo Jianqing\u2019s dark amber eyes with a touch of delight were fixed on him.\u201cMaster, you promised me that if I defeat all these people who come here to challenge Tai Hua Mountain, you will teach me something that I\u2019ve been wondering for a long time.\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s eyes was covered with frost. He said in an ice-cold tone, \u201cDid I really promised it?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s voice was bleak as well, \u201cBut you didn\u2019t say no to it!\u201dXuan Lingzi, \u201c\u2026\u201dXuan Lingzi never felt more troubled in the past dozens of years than recently. In the past, his well-mannered disciple put all his efforts into cultivation. As his Master, Xuan Lingzi never needed to strictly educate him. However, recently\u2026 with the tip of ear flushing, Xuan Lingzi flicked his sleeves and turned his back towards Luo Jianqing, shoving him away.Luo Jianqing was left where he stood, but he walked to the front of Xuan Lingzi again then looked up, staring at his Master.Eyes widening, Xuan Lingzi was surprised by Luo Jianqing\u2019s action. He turned his back on him again, but Luo Jianqing followed up. The two repeated the action for a total of five rounds. Finally, Xuan Lingzi had had enough. Irritated, he flicked his sleeve, striking Luo Jianqign three meters away. \u201cWhen did you\u2026 become this impudent?!\u201dLuo Jianqing ignored his question. His feet gently tapping the ground, he blocked Xuan Lingzi\u2019s way again. Having no intention to break the silence, he simply looked at his Master with a gleam of joy hidden beneath his gaze. Xuan Lingzi gradually lost control of his poker face. Again, he turned his back on him.At that moment, Luo Jianqing said, \u201cWu Yin, you asked me to give you some time.\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s fists clenched in his sleeves. He didn\u2019t reply.That didn\u2019t influence Luo Jianqing. Beaming, he dropped his head and said in a throaty voice, \u201cToday, I fought with an excellent sorcerer who is a master of mirage. He led me into one, in which you censured me for dishonoring Yu Xiao Peak; you refused to admit that I was your disciple; you said that you wanted me dead, then\u2026 your sword pierced the left side of my chest.\u201dTalking with head hanging low, Luo Jianqing wasn\u2019t aware that every single word he said made Xuan Lingzi sweating heavily. Trembling, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s fingers pinched his own palms, leaving behind several blood-dripping scratches. The wounds healed quickly but was torn cracked again.Colossal amount of Spiritual Power was flooding inside Xuan Lingzi\u2019s body. His eyes were turning red.Luo Jianqing went on, \u201cthat moment, I dropped my sword. I thought that, you want me dead, then what\u2019s the matter of being so? I am alive, right here, right now, with no mother nor father, only you. If you want to abandon me as well, then\u2026 what\u2019s the point for me to staying alive?\u201d\u201cJianqing\u2026\u201d Hoarsely, Xuan Lingzi called his name.Luo Jianqing kept saying, \u201cThe people I envy the most are those Fiend Cultivators. They are unrestrained, whimsical, but above all \u2013 free. Even for those who bring death to the innocents, at least they have the freedom to do and say whatever they want. Not like me, whom, is constrained by the etiquettes set by the so-called righteous cultivators, cannot even express the love he has towards the person he likes. Wu Yin, I once thought about cutting the bond between me and Tai Hua Mountain\u2026\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s pupils shrank. Scarlet was encroaching his eyes, \u201cJianqing!\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled, \u201cBut, on the other hand, I value our Master-disciple relationship. If I keep the bond, at least\u2026 I am your disciple. If others speak of me, they might put our names together. In this way, I can still comfort myself \u2013 fool myself \u2013 that\u2026\u201dA sudden hug stupefied Luo Jianqing.The embrace with scorching warmth came so quickly that Luo Jianqing wasn\u2019t prepared for it at all. Transfixed for a while, Luo Jianqing raised his arms and hugged back. It was only a gentle, careful, embrace at first, but they held each other tighter and tighter, until both put into all of their strength.Xuan Lingzi\u2019s eyes were completely scarlet already. Blood was seeping out from his mouth. The Internal Demon was gnawing his Spiritual Power. He held his disciple in his arms as if he had lost his mind\u2026 as if he wanted them merging into one.He called again and again with a husky voice, \u201cJianqing\u2026 Jianqing\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing beamed, suddenly figured something out, then replied, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201dThe blood dripping from Xuan Lingzi\u2019s mouth started carrying a wisp of golden light, but Xuan Lingzi still held Luo Jianqing tight, hiding the blood from him. The hug lasted for a long time until Xuan Lingzi broke the silence, \u201cJianqing, I want to\u2026 tell you something.\u201dLuo Jianqing lifted his eyebrow and chuckled, \u201cMaster, there is something that I want to tell you as well.\u201dListening to Luo Jianqing\u2019s pleasant voice, Xuan Lingzi slowly closed his eyes and tried to moderate his breath. The bloodbath scene finally dissipated from his mind. The bloody color in his eyes also vanished along with the grievous memory.Xuan Lingzi said, \u201cYou go first.\u201dLuo Jianqing was enjoying the slight aroma of lotus, smiling, \u201cNo, you go first.\u201dThey remained silence, then spoke at the same time:\u201cJianqing, I adore you!\u201d\u201cMaster, I want to ride you!\u201dXuan Lingzi, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(III)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFeeling the stiffness of the man in his embrace, Luo Jianqing burst into a laughter. His resignation, his resentment, his chagrin\u2026 all vanished into the void. He pulled himself away from his Master and looked right into his eyes.Xuan Lingzi had already well-managed his facial expression. He looked pretty normal, except for his slightly pale face.With a winsome smile, Luo Jianqing said, \u201cAbout what I just said, Master, do you accept my suggestion?\u201dAfter a long silence, Xuan Lingzi asked, \u201cWhat do you mean by\u2026 \u2018ride\u2019?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s eyes widened, and his silver tongue went stiff when he heard Xuan Lingzi\u2019s question.A cool breeze was roaming around the forest. The leaves rustled and broke the silence. The two stared at each other. Luo Jianqing swallowed subconsciously, then asked in a careful tone, \u201cMaster, do you really have no idea what is\u2026 \u2018ride\u2019?\u201dXuan Lingzi frowned a bit, still a poker face. He replied in a calm voice, \u201cIs that a maneuver?\u201dLuo Jianqing chuckled and asked again. Just like before, Xuan Lingzi slightly shook his head with an indifferent expression.You forced me to do this, Luo Jianqing thought, raising his voice, \u201cHow come you don\u2019t even know what is couple cultivation?!\u201dThen Xuan Lingzi raised his right hand with the index and middle fingers held together, slowly connected his fingertips to the four-petal bice lotus located between Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyebrows. Luo Jianqing was stunned, had no idea what his Master was going to do. He felt his Master\u2019s graceful gaze on him, then heard Xuan Lingzi said in a cool tone, \u201cLike this?\u201dLips pursed, Luo Jianqing frowned in confusion. He wanted to ask his Master for further clarification, and that\u2019s when the unexpected happened.Boom!A stream of pleasure engulfed Luo Jianqing\u2019s consciousness. Like a roaring wave, the climax flooded through every corner of his flesh. It was an orgasm more pleasant than any kind of touch or intercourse could bring him. The intense feeling crushed Luo Jianqing\u2019s sobriety which he had been so proud of. At that moment, he indulged in the overwhelming orgasm. Strength dried up and vision blurred, Luo Jianqing collapsed in Xuan Lingzi\u2019s arms, pants wetted by his own cum.It all, indeed, happened in less than a second, but for Luo Jianqing, it seemed time was protracted even longer than thousands of years.Luo Jianqing was leaning on Xuan Lingzi\u2019s chest, so he missed Xuan Lingzi\u2019s slightly blushed cheeks and rare gasping.The pleasure of orgasm was still lingering in Luo Jianqing\u2019s vines. He didn\u2019t have strength to lift a single finger. Luo Jianiqng indulged in the pleasure, though it only happened in less than a blink, but still, that feeling was like a drug, and, for that very moment, Luo Jianqing was \u2013 and surely willing to be \u2013 an addict.\u201cAh\u2026ah\u2026\u201dPanting drastically for a long time, Luo Jianqing finally retrieved some strength to talk.He can feel the fabric between his thighs bedewed by his secretion. Even a gentle rubbing against the clothes could let him moan with delight. Luo Jianqing tried his best to hold the lewd sound back. Shivering, he shoved Xuan Lingzi away and reeled for several steps, then he questioned his Master in an obviously astonished tone, \u201cHow could you\u2026\u201dHe shut his mouth up immediately.Husky but attractive, his voice was trembling mildly with a lustful afterglow of the climax.Luo Jianqing coughed immediately. He didn\u2019t notice Xuan Lingzi\u2019s darkened eyes and reddened ear-tips when his voice reached to his Master.Disbelieving what he had been through, Luo Jianqing asked in a quivering voice, \u201cHow could you\u2026 do that\u2026\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s tone went throaty, \u201cThis is couple cultivation. Since the day you brought it up, I have been looking up codex in search of the precise description. This is what I found: couple cultivation, a maneuver which has to be operated by two cultivators together, during which, one creeps the Primordial Life into another one\u2019s body, using Spiritual Power to guide the\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dHearing his Master\u2019s husky voice, Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t help but feel flaccid. He couldn\u2019t believe Xuan Lingzi really looked up what couple cultivation was. Moreover, he was still in shock by the fact that he completely lost his manners due to such an insignificant so-called \u2018maneuver\u2019.An intense feeling of disgrace devoured Luo Jianqing. Before Xuan Lingzi could notice the anomaly between Luo Jianqing\u2019s thighs, the disciple scurried away from the forest, rushed into his house and slammed the door behind him.This time, surprisingly, the one who fled turned out to be Luo Jianqing, leaving Xuan Lingzi standing there alone.Luo Jianqing wondered if this was the real couple cultivation. Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Primordial Life didn\u2019t get into his body at all. What stirred up all the mess inside him was simply his Master\u2019s overwhelming Deity-transformation-level Spiritual Power which fused with his Primordial Life. If it was the true couple cultivation, his Master shouldn\u2019t be able to maintain the poker-face anymore. He would be just like him, drowning in the ocean of lust.So, this was what was called \u2018the rule of jungle\u2019, Luo Jianqing thought, couldn\u2019t believe that he lost because of the cultivation base.Luo Jianqing hid in his house for a whole night, while Xuan Lingzi went back to the room and meditated, trying to hold back the desire.Mo Qiu finally escaped from the pestering of the Mo Family by midnight, dashing to Yu Xiao Peak for shelter but thought of the wards set up around the peak. He shouted Luo Jianqing\u2019s name for a total of one hour but didn\u2019t receive any respond.The Elders of Mo Family finally caught up, \u201cMo Qiu! We won\u2019t force you to marry the daughter of the direct heir anymore! Come back!\u201dMouth twitched, Mo Qiu flew away again.At last, he made to the Yu Xiao Peak on the next day\u2019s evening. Luo Jianqing showed up and brought him in this time. The Fiend Cultivator couldn\u2019t stop complaining, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you respond last night? They want to force me back for marriage! It was so close. Man, I almost lost my freedom!\u201dThe words \u201clast night\u201d triggered Luo Jianqing\u2019s memory. Luo Jianqing blushed but tried his best to be serious, \u201cI was cultivating.\u201dMo Qiu frowned, \u201c\u2026but I sent the message through Spiritual Sense as well.\u201d\u201cI was, well, very concentrated.\u201dMo Qiu, \u201c\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing tried his best to meditate but couldn\u2019t forget the climax. He had no idea how Xuan Lingzi felt about it. What he knew was just\u2026 he was drowning, voluntarily, in that dissolute pleasure.It was Luo Jianqing\u2019s first time to do this kind of thing. The fusion of Primordial Life was far more than what he could bear. However, in the bamboo house next to his, Xuan Lingzi wasn\u2019t that uninfluenced as he appeared to be. He saw his sensuous disciple sinking into the lustful desire because of him. The rippling eyes were graved on his memory forever, stirring his tranquil heart.Mo Qiu didn\u2019t linger on the Yu Xiao Peak for any longer. Before the day ended, he was ready to leave.Luo Jianqing tried to persuade him to stay, but saw Mo Qiu\u2019s overcast face, \u201cI have no intention to be caught and brought back to that Mo Family. Those psychopaths want me to marry their girl! Can you believe that? A total stranger! I can\u2019t stay here anymore. Luo Jianqing, there is something that I need to deal with in Yun State. I will be there for several weeks, if you need me for anything at any time, come and find me.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded, \u201cNo problem. Take care of yourself.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Luo Jianqing looked at him in wonder, but before he could say anything, Mo Qiu lowered his voice and asked, \u201cDo you\u2026 really love your Master?\u201dAstonished, Luo Jianqing beamed, \u201cYes, indeed, and we have already been together.\u201dMo Qiu pondered for a while, then said, \u201cNow that otherworldly Master Xuan Lingzi is willing to let go all the common etiquettes which used to shackle him, he is being sincere \u2013 I guess. Nevertheless, Luo Jianqing, this doesn\u2019t seem like a good deal. Xuan Lingzi has been cultivating for more than three hundred years, which means he is three hundred years older than you.\u201dLuo Jianqing chuckled, \u201cSo what? As cultivators, three hundred years is nothing but a blink of an eye for us. A Deity Transformation Period cultivator has a life-span which can last for five thousand years; a Da Sheng Period cultivator can live up to three thousand years. I am just a Nascent Soul Period cultivator for now, only have eight hundred years left. Compared to the high-level cultivators, I am the one who is closer to the gate of death and in need of taking pains to cultivate.\u201dWith his back to Luo Jianqing, Mo Qiu asked in a bizarre tone, \u201cThree hundred years\u2026 just a blink of an eye?\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded, \u201cIndeed.\u201dSlowly, Mo Qiu turned back, staring at Luo Jianqing with mixed feelings, and said in a low voice, \u201cFor someone, however, three-hundred year is what he\u2019s been craving for.\u201dLuo Jianqing frowned in confusion at first, then suddenly figured out what Mo Qiu was saying, \u201cYou mean those cultivators who come close to their life-span limits? That\u2019s right. For them, every second is precious. Nonetheless, if considering all the creatures living on the Xuan Tian Continent, a natural death is a quiet satisfying thing. The battle of Human and Demon Clans is such a bloodbath. Surviving from it\u2026 is good enough.\u201dMo Qiu laughed with elusive emotion hidden beneath, \u201cYou\u2019re right. Staying alive is good enough.\u201dThey chatted for a while until Mo Qiu felt it was time to leave. Right before he took off, he casted a beam of red light into Luo Jianqing\u2019s hands, leaving behind several words in the breeze, \u201cI know righteous cultivators like you so well, stubborn and fusty. Since you have found your partner for life, I \u2013 as one of few people who know this and as your friend \u2013 hereby give you a present to celebrate it. Luo Jianqing, no need to thank me! Ha ha ha ha ha!\u201dWhen the echoing was finally blown away by the wind, Mo Qiu already flew away for dozens of miles, nowhere to be seen.Baffled by this friend, Luo Jianqing slightly shook his head and smiled. He then checked the \u201cgift\u201d that Mo Qiu left him, carefully unsealed the red light.It was a book which couldn\u2019t be more normal.Noticing the words graved on the cover, Luo Jianqing read them out, \u201cSpring Breeze Stroke Record?\u00a0 A record of some special maneuvers? Is this\u2026\u201dHe stopped mumbling abruptly. Luo Jianiqng stared at the nude paintings on every page of the book, stupefied for a moment. The book was slammed close, making the reader blush in an instant. Even if he liked to flirt with his fusty Master, Luo Jianqing was no playboy. Compared to a Fiend Cultivator such as Mo Qiu, Luo Jianqing was so innocent.Irritated, Luo Jianqing gripped the book, \u201cMo! Qiu!\u201dSubconsciously, he tried to destroy the book, but before Mo Qiu\u2019s \u201cgift\u201d was torn into pieces, what Xuan Lingzi said a few days ago thumped in Luo Jianqing\u2019s head \u2013 \u201cWhat is \u2018ride\u2019?\u201dSmiling mischievously, he put the book in his Interspatial Ring and flew back to the top of Yu Xiao Peak.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t go back to his own house but came to the other one. He lightly knocked on the door and said, \u201cMaster, I met some difficulties while cultivating. Can I look up in the books on your shelf?\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s bleak voice broke through the door and reached Luo Jianiqng\u2019s ears, \u201cCome in.\u201dAfter getting inside, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t go to the shelf and apply the trick, instead, he walked toward Xuan Lingzi and stood right in front of him. Eyes closed, his Master was meditating, but that couldn\u2019t stop Luo Jianqing from looking at him. Xuan Lingzi\u2019s ear-tips reddened. He coughed, finally opened his eyes, frowned, \u201cWhat book are you looking for?\u201dLuo Jianqing shook his head, \u201cMaster, you said something to me several days ago, right? It was so noisy out there, I could hardly hear what you said.\u201dXuan Lingzi was confused, having no idea what his disciple was talking about.Luo Jianqing asked again, \u201cMaster, what was that again? I am the\u2026 what of your eye?\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s ear-tips were so red that it wouldn\u2019t be bizarre if they started to drip blood. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t notice that, however. Xuan Lingzi tried hard to bring his tone back to normal, finally demanded in a calm voice, \u201cGo look up what you need to know, now.\u201d Then he closed his eyes again, as if he went back to meditating.Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t obey his order, nonetheless. He sat right next to his Master and felt the sudden stiffness of the world\u2019s greatest cultivator. Leaning on Xuan Lingzi and chuckling, Luo Jianqing whispered, \u201cMaster, you haven\u2019t told me what you said that day. Oh, I recalled something. You said that you love\u2026\u201d\u201cGo read your book!\u201dXuan Lingzi operated Spiritual Power and shoved Luo Jianqing to the bookshelf. When Luo Jianqing managed to look back, the white-robe cultivator had already gone. Looking around the empty room, Luo Jianqing smiled and shrugged, then took out the book from his Interspatial Ring.Looked at the words on the book cover \u2013 Spring Breeze Stroke Record, Luo Jianqing blushed and foisted the book in the shelf as quickly as possible.Finishing all of these, he picked one book at random and started browsing while waiting for Xuan Lingzi\u2019s return. Nevertheless, Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t show up even when the sun rested, and the moon hung high. Suddenly, Luo Jianqing figured something out. He put back the book and left the house.Fifteen minutes later, a white figure flew across the forest and dashed into the bamboo house.Xuan Lingzi sighed, with a helpless expression emerging on his elegant face. He flicked the sleeves. A Moonlit Light was kindled. While walking to the bed, he heard a mild knock at the door.Stunned at first, Xuan Lingzi turned around, only to see his winsome, young disciple gently opening the door. The cultivator dressed in bice was standing under the moonbeam. He looked at his Master with his limpid brown eyes, and mumbled, \u201cMaster, Jianqing\u2026 wants to sleep with you.\u201dHis voice was purely artless, without any complicated emotion mixed in it.All was the same with what happened thirty years ago:Back then Xuan Lingzi built another bamboo house for Luo Jianqing, commanding him to cultivate alone. That night, his disciple who was still a kid came to Xuan Lingzi\u2019s room, attempting to sneak on his bed but was scolded by him.After the scold, however, the Master and the disciple still shared a bed.Xuan Lingzi stared at the young man with a complexed look, while Luo Jianqing smiled and fixed his eyes on him calmly. They looked at each other for a long time. At last, Xuan Lingzi let out a gentle sigh, \u201cIf you are determined to disobey my order, then I shall\u2026 allow you do what you want.\u201dThat night, the two who hadn\u2019t slept for days, finally lie on the same bed for a sleep, without taking off their clothes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(V)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Jianqing wasn\u2019t a child anymore, so he couldn\u2019t fit in his Master\u2019s warm arms. Slowly, however, his hand creeped on Xuan Lingzi\u2019s waist, gently pulling himself closer to his Master. After a while, Xuan Lingzi slightly frowned and let out a sigh.He stroked Luo Jianqing\u2019s back, reducing their distance.This was the most peaceful night Luo Jianqing had ever had in the past thirty-one years since the day Xuan Lingzi commanded him to sleep alone. He fell into deep sleep in his Master\u2019s arms as if he had come back to his one and only harbor, the warmest and safest place in the world. What surrounded him was the light aroma of lotus. The warmth conducted through his fingertips eased his mind.In the middle of the night, even Xuan Lingzi was asleep \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 given that the last time he did so was couples of years ago.Moonlight kindled the room. It looked like they had gone back to dozens of years ago. A Master, a disciple, and a bamboo house. Nothing had really changed.Since that night, Luo Jianqing abandoned his house, coming up every possible excuse to prolong the staying in his Master\u2019s house. At first, Xuan Lingzi would still scold him, but after seeing his disciple\u2019s dramatically disappointed face, he could do nothing but allow him to stay.This time, however, Luo Jianqing\u2019s plan was interrupted. Ten days later, a ragged young man arrived at the gate of Tai Hua Mountain. The guarding disciples were about to stop him from going further but found out the man was actually a Foundation Establishment Period Cultivator!Seeing Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s disciples, the strange man cried with excitement, \u201cI\u2019m back! Finally! I\u2019m back!!!\u201dIt\u2019s been several months since Luo Jianqing came back from the Billion Beasts Mountain. He almost forgot that he had kicked Li Xiuchen to the foothill.It was surely a difficult journey for Li Xiuchen to return to Tai Hua Mountain. Normally, one \u2013 after going through what he had experienced and even missed the Grand Septennial Competition \u2013 should collect one\u2019s minds and take pains cultivating. Nonetheless, on the third week after he went back to Tai Hua Mountain, Li Xiuchen set off again.As soon as he left, Xie Zizhuo sent a brother to inform Luo Jianqing of where the blighter was heading. Xie Zizhuowasn\u2019t thinking too much, taking Luo Jianqing\u2019s interest on Li Xiuchen as a result of pure curiosity.However, when Lou Jianqing was told that Li Xiuchen left in such a hurry, he frowned and pondered, then went back to his house and started packing.That night, Xuan Lingzi flicked his sleeves and turned off the Moonlit Light. Before he could position himself into a comfortable position, his eyes met his disciple\u2019s limpid eyes.Xuan Lingzi was tranced, then he heard Luo Jianqing said, \u201cI\u2019m leaving.\u201d\u201cFor what?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s something that I need to deal with. Master, I have to leave tomorrow.\u201dStill wearing his expressionless mask, Xuan Lingzi said in an ice-cold voice, \u201cThe Middle-stage Nascent Soul Period is within your reach. Thus, you should concentrate on meditation in order to reach the next level sooner. It\u2019s an undesirable timing for you to leave Tai Hua Mountain right now.\u201dLuo Jianqing frowned, \u201cBut I should go.\u201dBleakness dyed Xuan Lingzi\u2019s pupils, \u201cAnd I said no.\u201dLuo Jianqing pouted, \u201cWhy?!\u201d\u201cJust, think about how many life-threatening dangers you\u2019ve encountered in the past few years: you nearly lost your life in Sir Bei Dou\u2019s tomb, accidentally confined yourself in the Liu Yan Valley, fought with a fierce Ninth-level Demon Beast and\u2026 Jianqing, if you leave for another adventure, I\u2026 Uhm\u2026\u201dPassionate kiss sealed Xuan Lingzi\u2019s lips, forcing him to swallow what he was going to say. The Master widened his eyes, startled by the intimate kiss. Luo Jianqing embraced Xuan Lingzi, and with that position he held his Master down on the bed, winsome eyes fixed on the latter who was still in shock.Lustrous hair cascaded down, gently scratching Xuan Lingzi\u2019s cheeks. The moonlight lit up Luo Jianqing\u2019s resplendent visage; Xuan Lingzi was transfixed for a moment. Breathtaking, that was the only word left in his mind. When he finally regained his consciousness, he found his disciple\u2019s lips were on his again.With Internal Demons securely locked deep down in his heart, Xuan Lingzi wasn\u2019t that passionate. He lay on the bed meekly, letting his disciple do what he wanted. When the kiss started to lose control, Xuan Lingzi squinted, suddenly stretched his arms and pulled Luo Jianqing towards him.\u201cUhm\u2026\u201dThe young cultivator wasn\u2019t expecting this, so, astonished, he opened his mouth, which gave the conqueror a chance to sneak in. Xuan Lingzi\u2019s tongue licked inside Luo Jianqing\u2019s mouth, dipping and swirling, which made him moan with delight.Lustful vibe fulfilled the room. The glow of moon shrouded Tai Hua Mountain where the Yu Xiao Peak was the center.No one on the Tai Hua Mountain would know that their most reverent Master Xuan Lingzi and their most respected Great Senior Brother were committing incest. They kept kissing passionately, releasing the desires that had been held back for dozens of years. When they finally disengaged, Luo Jianqing was sitting on top of Xuan Lingzi, panting drastically.Xuan Lingzi gazed at his disciple impassively, but the flushing ear-tips exposed his emotions.Luo Jianqing chuckled hoarsely, \u201cWu Yin, I need to leave Tai Hua Mountain\u2026\u201dStaring at him for a long time, Xuan Lingzi asked, \u201cDo you\u2026 have to?\u201dNodded solemnly, Luo Jianqing answered, \u201cYes.\u201dFinally, Xuan Lingzi went silent and nodded, approved this decision.They cuddled up together, seeming to have fallen into a deep sleep. Nonetheless, Xuan Lingzi suddenly lifted one of his fingers, about to touch Luo Jianqing\u2019s forehead. The latter grabbed his wrist, slightly irritated, \u201cWhat are you doing?!\u201dXuan Lingzi fixed his eyes on his disciple and asked again, \u201c\u2026 do you really have to go?\u201dLuo Jianqing went speechless.On the next day, when the first beam of sunlight touched the bamboo forest surrounding their house, Luo Jianqing immediately got up, about to leave. He turned around when he reached the door, squinted at Xuan Lingzi, \u201cDon\u2019t you ever put your fingers between my eyebrows, again! Unless you have my consent!\u201dXuan Lingzi was astonished, \u201c\u2026 are you ordering me?\u201dLuo Jianqing scoffed, \u201cyes!\u201d\u201cWithout your consent\u2026\u201d, Xuan Lingzi said subconsciously, \u201cI can\u2019t couple-cultivate with you?\u201dFeet taping the ground, Luo Jianqing took off and left Tai Hua Mountain with a blush on his cheeks, leaving behind his Master staying there contemplating blankly.After three hours of flying, Luo Jianqing eventually caught up Li Xiuchen who was in a hurry. With that clumsy guy in sight, Luo Jianqing finally relieved. Gradually, however, he touched his lips helplessly, and mumbled, \u201cIf not for snatching opportunities, I\u2019m willing to give in everything that I have in exchange for staying at Yu Xiao Peak with my Master\u2026 forever.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At first, he was just complaining about all these daunting things that had happened to him, but, gradually and to Luo Jianqing\u2019s surprise, he started to realize something was wrong, \u201cWhy is it that nothing went on as planed? I got nothing from Sir Bei Dou\u2019s tomb nor from Wan Shou Peak. The latter is the weirdest. I remember seeing that pill! It was right there, several steps away! How come I blacked out at that perfect timing and woke up at foothill? Not to mention the pill was nowhere to be found.\u201dTo be honest, Luo Jianqing was impressed that Li Xiuchen could realize this. As far as he\u2019s concerned, Li Xiuchen was still an idiot making zero progress for eight years since the first time they met. Now, given that he managed to look back and think, it was already a \u2018huge\u2019 step.Nonetheless, this was all that Li Xiuchen could think about. No matter how hard he tried, this poor guy just couldn\u2019t figure out why.They arrived at Yun State in the evening.Xuan Tian Continent contained one mountain, thirty-six states, eight Zone of Risk and sixteen Waste Land.\u2018One mountain\u2019, of course, referred to Tai Hua Mountain which was located at the center of the whole continent; as for thirty-six states, these were the regions of habitat for all the mankind; one of the eight Zones of Risk was the Northern Land of Arctic where Luo Jianqing was found by his Second Brother and Sixth Brother when he was a fugitive in his previous life; then, about the sixteen Waste Lands, the Northern Waste Land where Mo Qiu came from was one of the regions.Yun State was not a very prosperous state compared to the other thirty-five states. None of the major sects rooted at here. With vast plains and few challenging mountain ranges, Yun State became a perfect place for some minor sects to thrive.There was only one thing that made Yun State special \u2013 it was neighboring the Fiend Palace which was the most unique place all over the regions of mankind: not a part of thirty-six states, the Fiend Palace was a paradise for the Fiend Cultivators.Everyone knew that \u2013 as long as it was not in the middle of the Human-Demon War \u2013 Fiend Cultivators were the enemies of all. \u2018Eliminate the Fiend Cultivators\u2019 had been a creed most of the righteous cultivators hold for thousands of years. However, after the Fiend Exalt made his name a well-known one, the table was turned. This powerful cultivator built the Fiend Palace, led all the other Fiend Cultivators and declared a war against the rest of mankind. Three states conquered in a flash. In the end, the Tai Hua Mountain sent their Great Elder \u2013 the Peak Master of Yu Xiao Peak at that time \u2013 to negotiate with the Fiend Exalt, and that\u2019s how the battle was put to an end.From then on, the Fiend Cultivators had a safe-land of their own \u2014 the Fiend Palace.After all, the event described above happened three thousand years ago. Many had already forgot. The reason why Luo Jianqing still remembered this was that the Elder who stopped the bloodbath was Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Master.Only one Superior Spiritual Bone could be born in a millennium, but that was not guaranteed. Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Master had no Superior Spiritual Bone, and he waited three thousand years then finally got Xuan Lingzi, but, luckily, Xuan Lingzi only spent three hundred years waiting for another Superior Spiritual Bone, Luo Jianqing.Luo Jianqing knew that people were saying Tai Hua Mountain\u2019s Great Elder defeated the Fiend Cultivator, but he also knew that the truth was actually the opposite of what the commoners believed. When he was little, Xuan Lingzi told him that, \u201cthe Fiend Exalt was a respectful man who defeated your Grand-Master.\u201dAt that time, Xuan Lingzi had already reached Deity Transformation Period. His praise was a solid prove on how powerful the Fiend Exalt was.Everyone knew that the Fiend Exalt has brought death upon countless men. His cultivation was nothing different with a massacre. A brute devil indeed, but that didn\u2019t stop people from worshiping him as a legend, given that the Fiend Exalt accomplished all of these with a humble, Low-graded First-level Spiritual Bone.Among the Seven Sons of Tai Hua Mountain, five owned the Supreme-graded First-level Spiritual Bone, one owned the Superior Spiritual Bone, the least gifted Zuo Yunmo still got a High-graded First-level Spiritual Bone.Compared to them, the Fiend Exalt was not favored by fortune at all: Low-graded Spiritual Bone had little chance breaking through Tribulation Passage Period.However, he \u2013 no matter how unlikely \u2013 still became the Fiend Exalt.Luo Jianqing thought about all of these things once stepping on the land of Yun State. Although they hadn\u2019t met at all, Luo Jianqing already heard lots of things about the Fiend Exalt.Luo Jianqing knew the reason why Li Xiuchen decided to come here today.In Seeking Immortality II, Li Xiuchen was destined to meet his third mistress here who was a brutal, aloof young girl. She was always dressed in black so that the trace of blood wouldn\u2019t dye her clothes in any other colors. The girl was in favor of striking in a sudden without any weapon, fingertips piercing through the skin and tearing the heart out alive. Her eyes would kindle with delight by the rhythm of the still booming heart. Her diabolic smile would be your last memory.This was the Fiend Exalt\u2019s disciple \u2013 a Fiend Cultivatress, Yun Xiang.After entering the Yun State, Luo Jianqing hid his breath, pretending to be a low-level cultivator. He pondered for a while then took out a silver mask from his Interspatial Ring and put it on.Tailing Li Xiuchen and watching him enter a lodge, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t follow him in but chose another one which was located a block away.Because it was right next to the Fiend Palace, often there were cultivators patrolling the city. The commoners already got used to them. Cultivators were always unpredictable, so no one paid attention to Luo Jianqing who was wearing a mask.The lord of the state, of course, was at least a Body-Fusion-Period Cultivator, not to mention there were three promising sects within the state. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t want to run any risk. He took the key from the front desk and entered his room, then stayed there for meditating and cultivating, waiting patiently.Three days later, a gorgeous girl dressed in black trod casually across Luo Jianqing\u2019s lodge. The silver bell decorated on her clothes tinkled along with her movement, composing a pleasant melody.Surely, there were people who thought the sound annoying. However, they decided to do nothing but endure it after they sensed the girl\u2019s cultivation level.Late-stage Gold Core Period!Reaching this level of cultivation at this young age, she must come from a grand sect! It wouldn\u2019t be a good idea challenging her!Standing beside the window on the second floor, Luo Jianqing was watching the enchanting girl. The latter walked for one more block and entered the lodge where Li Xiuchen was staying. Luo Jianqing did nothing but smile reluctantly.Yun State was a large state with more than a thousand lodges available at anywhere. Seeking Immortality II didn\u2019t point out in which lodge Li Xiuchen would meet his mistress, but Yun Xiang still went in the one Li Xiuchen picked.Such a fortune favored guy.Luo Jianqing checked out his room and came to the tailor shop built next to Li Xiuchen\u2019s lodge.The shopkeeper came to Luo Jianqing with hospitality, but heard Luo Jianqing said with a winsome smile, \u201cMay I live here?\u201d, offering a piece of gold to him.Everything went as planned. Luo Jianqing stayed at the tailor shop.Since their distance had been reduced, he wasn\u2019t worried that his Spiritual Sense would be sensed by others. Secretly, he scanned the lodge all over and found the one with highest cultivation was an Elder of early-stage Nascent Soul Period. Li Xiuchen, as an early-stage Foundation Establishment Period cultivator, however, was the one with lowest cultivation base in the lodge.Li Xiuchen\u2019s room was named \u2018Earth Primary\u2019, while Yun Xiang\u2019s room was named \u2018Heaven Primary\u2019 which located right above Li Xiuchen\u2019s.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Rarely cultivating, Li Xiuchen spent most of his time taking a bath in the bathtub or hanging out in the street. Naturally, he had no idea that Yun Xiang already arrived at the lodge, living upstairs, and even set up a ward around her room.The ward was a powerful one indeed. Even Luo Jianqing failed to break it without alarming Yun Xiang. However, he knew exactly what Yun Xiang was doing inside the ward.According to Seeking Immortality II, Yun Xiang found a Fiend magic item from the riverside outside the Yun State. The item contained colossal Enmity Qi. If refined successfully, it would surely be a Heaven-level magic item!The street was bustling with people, and chaos was a perfect cover for Yun Xiang\u2019s ward which she was very confident with. It was a magic item that the Fiend Exalt bestowed on her, and because of that she was sure that cultivators under Tribulation Passage Period had zero chance of breaking it. That\u2019s why she decided to refine the item in Yun State instead of waiting until she returned to the Fiend Palace.Li Xiuchen was constantly asking the waiter for bathtub, seldom carrying out his cultivation at all;, in the room right above him, Yun Xiang carefully set up the last layer of the ward; in the tailor shop located next to their lodge, Luo Jianqing\u2019s body was voluntarily operating Nine Heavenly Seizure Record, inspired by the law of nature and seizing Spiritual Power from the heaven and earth.When Yun Xiang finally took out the Soul Summoning Streamer from her Interspatial Ring, Luo Jianqing widened his eyes, gazing at the direction of her room.He couldn\u2019t sense the streamer directly, but indeed detected a wisp of tremendous Enmity Qi which \u2013 because of its colossal amount \u2013 condensed into solid entity, restlessly colliding with Yun Xiang\u2019s ward. Suddenly, perhaps it was because the Enmity Qi was so diabolic thus causing mutation of the ward, Luo Jianqing was surprised that he could actually see what\u2019s going on in Yun Xiang\u2019s room.The enchanting girl dressed in black was standing at the center of the room, watching the Enmity Qi trying desperately to break the ward, then she sneered, \u201cDreaming about destroy my Heavenly Fiend Ward? Who do you think you are? If you are willing to submit right now, I promise I will not erase your consciousness, but if you do not behave yourself, I\u2019ll kill you right away!\u201dSuch a bold, peremptory girl. But her way of talking sounded familiar to Luo Jianqing. With Mo Qiu\u2019s scarlet figure emerging in his mind, Luo Jianqing slightly shook his head, \u201cYun Xiang resembles Mo Qiu a lot. Both of them are so dominant and egoistic. Maybe that\u2019s a characteristic shared by all the Fiend Cultivators?\u201dHeard Yun Xiang\u2019s words, the Enmity Qi finally turned around, facing the girl who trapped it here.Yun Xiang lifted her chin, looking at the Enmity Qi asquint. The dark, roaring Enmity Qi transformed itself into a cloud of black mist, pouncing towards Yun Xiang as if it was irritated. The girl wasn\u2019t scared, instead, with total calmness, she took out a bell from her Interspatial Ring. When she did so, the Enmity Qi suddenly ceased motion.Yun Xiang beamed arrogantly, \u201cNow what? Scared?\u201dThe cloud of Enmity Qi slightly trembled, as if it was totally enraged but didn\u2019t have the guts to do anything.Yun Xiang taunted it, \u201cSuch a weak bully, aren\u2019t you? In the past ten years, is it really you who brought death upon more than a hundred people on the Mo Sha River? Behaving like a tamed dog right now, you\u2019re really a coward.\u201dThe Enmity Qi started to pound the ward fiercely.Yun Xiang sneered, \u201cStill imagining you can get away unharmed? You have no way out but death!\u201dShe shook the scarlet tiny bell which created no sound at all, but, there were invisible waves rippling out in the air.When the waves reached the Enmity Qi, the diabolic cloud had no ways to resist but groan with pain. This scene, indeed, impressed Luo Jianqing, who thought:\u2018What kind of bell is it? Containing such an impressive amount of power, this magic item empowers Yun Xiang to be more powerful than she should be.\u2019The sound wave generated by the bell made the Enmity Qi screaming in pain and writhing in the air as if it was undergoing great torture. Seeing this, Yun Xiang sniggered and accelerated her movement of shaking the bell. The next moment, however, the cloud of Enmity Qi roared in suffering, dashing towards her in madness.Yun Xiang glared at her enemy, hands clawed in the air, creating a scarlet shadow of claw which cut the Enmity Qi in half.The devil didn\u2019t stop the attack.In a sudden, they scuffled together. Shaking the bell constantly by using her left hand, Yun Xiang stroke at the Enmity Qi with her right hand forming a claw. The painful moaning didn\u2019t stop for a single second, but the black cloud of mist kept fighting, ripping Yun Xiang\u2019s clothes into pieces, making her smooth pearl-like skin exposed in the air.Watching such an alluring scene, Luo Jianqing felt nothing at all. He knew that Yun Xiang would put an end to this fight after casting the last maneuver. She would kill the Enmity Qi and passed out, then, at the same time, fell to the room below and landed in Li Xiuchen\u2019s bathtub.Yun Xiang\u2019s clothes was ripped into strips, while Li Xiuchen was completely naked!A little beauty fell from the above into the bathtub \u2013 Li Xiuchen couldn\u2019t be more surprised. According to the book, Li Xiuchen took the girl out of the bathtub, trying to put her on the bed, but Yun Xiang\u2019s mouth \u2013 unexpectedly \u2013 touched his thing.This was how the book put it:\u2018Looking at the voluptuous girl, Li Xiuchen felt the blood rushing towards his private part. The girl fell into the bathtub, clothes wetted completely, outlining her curvy body. Staring at her perfectly shaped breast, Li Xiuchen mumbled several times \u2018I am blind\u2019, then picked the girl out of the bathtub.\u2018When he finally got out of the bathtub, his thing unexpectedly came close to the girl\u2019s lips. Feeling the soft, luring breath, Li Xiuchen moved a little, and the cherry-like mouth started to rub his cock, as if she was kissing it.\u2019Luo Jianqing almost threw up when he read this plot, but he knew very well that, after all, Seeking Immortality was a sordid book indeed.The book said that Li Xiuchen acted as a gentleman. Even intrigued by the fainted girl, he still restrained himself from harassing Yun Xiang. However, he did masturbate in front of the nearly naked beauty and ejaculated on her luring body.Though Luo Jianqing was not a fan of Fiend Cultivator, he still didn\u2019t want to see Li Xiuchen doing such kind of filthy things. Moreover, on the next day, Yun Xiang would wake up and think it was Li Xiuchen who saved her life and then left him a way to contact her.Nevertheless, Luo Jianqing suspected that Li Xiuchen wouldn\u2019t do anything facing a nearly nude gorgeous girl.Now, the fight on the second floor was almost over. Yun Xiang\u2019s clothes were torn into pieces by the Enmity Qi. She was panting, squinting at her rival with rage, then suddenly belched a mouthful of blood on the bell.Immediately, the scarlet glow started to gleam on the bell which vibrated more drastically.The Enmity Soul was moribund, and because of that Yun Xiang loosened her guard. Luo Jianqing took Floating Frost Sword out, ready to help Yun Xiang if he must. As expected, the Enmity Qi roared with despair, gave out all it had and took the last strike.Without any hesitation, Luo Jianqing unsheathed his sword, but before he could leave the tailor shop, a beam of golden light pierced through the cloud of enmity mist.Astonished, Luo Jianqing stopped at where he was.A gentle, soothing voice reached their ears, \u201cAmitabha. Lady, you\u2019ve made countless contribution by trying to convert the Enmity Qi. This Soul Summoning Streamer is too vicious and brutal. From now on, I will take it by my side and chant the Lotus Mana Record for the next eighty-one days, releasing the thousands of enmity souls from purgatory as soon as possible.\u201dUnder the clear azure firmament, an elegant young monk wearing light-colored frock was standing on the sill of Yun Xiang\u2019s room, his palms put together devoutly. He drew a hand-seal, then the Soul Summoning Streamer came into his palm. He was standing there with grace, beaming winsomely, like a soft summer breeze, or a refined lotus flower.Yun Xiang stared at the monk blankly, while Luo Jianqing widened his eyes in surprise.This monk\u2026 was a middle-stage Nascent Soul Period cultivator at only seventy years old!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 85": "Chapter 85 - The Essence of Karma! & The Master and the Book (I)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLuo Jianqing sheathed Floating Frost Sword and decided to wait and see.Right now, although his cultivation base was lower than the monk for a level of stage, he still owned much more powerful Spiritual Sense than the latter who seemed wasn\u2019t aware of his snooping. Luo Jianqing concentrated his mind on what\u2019s going on in the room, ready to take any action if needed.Soul Summoning Streamer was suddenly snatched by a stranger popping up from nowhere; Yun Xiang\u2019s mind went blank for a moment, but after just a few seconds, she squinted, with right hand gradually forming a claw, warning the unwelcome guest in a low voice, \u201cNow heed my words, monk, today I have no intention of griming my hand with blood, so you\u2019d better return the Soul Summoning Streamer back to me, otherwise, I will send you to the hand of death!\u201dThough her words were threatening, Yun Xiang stayed vigilant.With a faint smile hanging on the delicately chiseled face, the monk seemed like being shrouded by the Buddha Glow. He fixed his eyes on the girl in black and said, \u201cLady, the Soul Summoning Streamer is no benign item, why are you so obsessed with it?\u201dYun Xiang sneered, \u201cSo, that\u2019s a \u2018no\u2019, I guess?\u201dThe monk slightly shook his head, \u201cYou can never deliver these enmity souls into samsara if they are confined by the streamer. An evil item like this should not exist in the world.\u201dYun Xiang lifted her chin, losing her manner, \u201cYou bald donkey! I\u2019m gonna tear you apart!\u201dThe next moment, a black shadow dashed forward with the skeleton-like sharp claw aiming at the young monk\u2019s neck. Yun Xiang was fast like a lightning, but her rival was even faster. Foot tapping the surface, he flew up from the sill and landed in the room swiftly, avoiding Yun Xiang\u2019s attack.Of course, Yun Xiang won\u2019t give up this easily.The battle was on. They scuffled together at once. The Fiend cultivatress struck mercilessly, while the monk kept backing off and dodging.As the Fiend Exalt\u2019s disciple, Yun Xiang was no mediocre kind of cultivator. She didn\u2019t use her Lethal Maneuvers at first, but, gradually, the shadow of claws tended to be more and more brutal, and every single strike was targeting at the monk\u2019s vital acupoints.However, to Luo Jianqing\u2019s surprise, the monk perfectly avoided all the whacks, remaining unharmed without taking a single action to fight back.While adroitly leaning to one side and letting Yun Xiang\u2019s claw jabbing in vain, he even had time to chuckle, \u201cAmitabha, lady, why are you so obsessed with it?\u201d\u201cLady, the Soul Summoning Streamer is not suitable for a female cultivator like you to use. Moreover, it is obviously not a proper enhancer for your Claw Maneuvers.\u201d\u201cLady, you\u2019ve been injured by the Enmity Qi when you were trying to tame it. Now is not the best time for you to rival with me.\u201dThere was no doubt that the monk had a pleasant voice like an ethereal Buddha chant, but Yun Xiang felt nothing but sarcasm.Determined to put this to an end, Yun Xiang squinted. Operating the roaring Fiend Power inside her body, she dashed forward. Along her side, the diabolic claw shadow was transformed into a gale of Fiend Qi, blotting out the ceiling, stunning the monk. The latter then ceased backing off, instead, he held the ground, reviving the Buddha Beads Bracelet around his wrist.Crystal-like Buddha Beads were floating in front of him, glittering with golden Buddha Glow.Boom!The Beads and the claw crushed into each other with tremendous momentum, which knocked Yun Xiang in the air, making her body pound the wall. She spat out a mouthful of dark blood. Lifting her head, the girl was enraged, \u201cBald donkey! Do you have a slightest idea about who I am? Today, you mess with me; tomorrow, I\u2019ll rip your head apart!\u201dThe monk beamed, \u201cNo need to threaten me . Of course I know who you are.\u201dYun Xiang was suddenly stunned, \u201cHow come\u2026you already know that?\u201dSmiling elegantly, the monk replied with limpid eyes which seemed like concealing colossal amount of wisdom, \u201cReaching late-stage Cold Core Period cultivation with a thirtyish Bone Age, only the talented one can achieve these. Among all the Fiend Cultivators, I assume, only the Fiend Exalt has the ability to train such an excellent disciple like you.\u201dOne hand covering her wounded chest, Yun Xiang got up and sneered, \u201cSo, you do know who I am, and still injured me whatsoever. Aren\u2019t you afraid that my Master will tear you apart? No, there\u2019s no need to bother him. After all, any one of the Fiend Palace\u2019 Elders can chop you into pieces, and that won\u2019t reduce my hatred! Even if you kneel and apologize right now, I will not forgive you!\u201dThe young monk lifted his gaze, fixing his eyes on her. He remained calm and elegant as before.Eyes meeting in the air, Yun Xiang was transfixed. Surprisingly, she didn\u2019t say anything satire but stayed silent.\u201cLady, you are possessed by your obsession. Eliminating insatiable greed, holding no desire for gluttony, not thinking for wrath, keeping away from the evil, these are already ways of cultivating Buddhism. I never did anything wrong, why and for what should you have my apology?\u201dHis words, obviously, added fuel to Yun Xiang\u2019s fire of rage, \u201cYou\u2019ve snatched my Soul Summoning Streamer! Isn\u2019t it something you should be ashamed of? Do you need more reason to apologize?!\u201dThe monk smiled, \u201cThe Soul Summoning Streamer belongs to no one. It might not do you any good in the future if you possess it.\u201dIrritated by his peaceful attitude, Yun Xiang went furiously speechless. Turning around, she suddenly saw her reflection in the mirror. Eyes widened, she immediately gripped the pieces of fabric hanging on her chest and took out a set of clothes from her Interspatial Ring.In a flash, Yun Xiang got an idea, \u201cHa! You\u2019ve seen my body! You broke the commandment of lust!\u201dThe monk shook his head and bowed down to salute, \u201cExperienced voidance of mind, purgation of heart, I hold none in filth, make no claim to lust, and thee \u2013 therefore \u2013 are no differ to a vase, dazzling and delicate, but that is all I see.\u201dBefore Yun Xiang could figure out what he meant, Luo Jianqing chuckled when he heard these words.Though he already had an idea about the monk\u2019s identity, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t interrupt their fight. He heard about this superior disciple of Gui Yuan Sect even in his last life, an endowed genius with great wisdom whose name was Yu Chen. This legendary monk had no Dharma name, and was called by the commoners as \u2018Fo Zi\u2019 (Buddha in Chinese is pronounced as \u2018Fo\u2019).Entitled with a name like this, he must have reached a decent level on analyzing the Buddha essence.Fo Zi\u2019s cultivation level was not that high. Now, though he only reached the middle-stage Nascent Soul Period, all the Buddha Cultivators were impressed by his sharp understanding on the essence of Buddha, giving him a respectful title of \u2018Fo Zi\u2019.For instance, a moment ago, Yun Xiang criticized Fo Zi for peeking at her body. As a Fiend Cultivator, she was no traditional fusty girl. Actually, if her flesh was seen, she wouldn\u2019t mind about it that much. What she really wanted was to humiliate him. Nonetheless, Fo Zi replied her that \u2018though I\u2019ve seen your nudity, it is nothing but a body composed of flesh and covered with skin because you are not in my heart. Then why should it count as breaking the commandment of lust?\u2019Luo Jianqing finally understood that why Fo Zi would be Yan Su\u2019s old enemy. If Yan Su didn\u2019t enter the Thousands of Ghosts Cave for five-years of indoor training and endured the heart-chewing pain, he would be left behind by Fo Zi for several levels of cultivation.In the end, Yun Xiang still failed to find out the meaning of Fo Zi\u2019s words. Irritated, she tried to block Fo Zi\u2019s way, keeping him from leaving the room, but the difference in their cultivation base was so distinct \u2013 plus her injuries of course \u2013 she had zero chance of success. Before Fo Zi left, she said to him in outrage, \u201cTell me your name! One day, I will definitely kill you even if I need to hunt you down to the very edge of the world!\u201dSlightly astonished, Fo Zi looked back to the glamorous girl and folded his hands together, \u201cMy humble name is Yu Chen. I have no Dharma name.\u201dFinishing the last word, he flew out, leaving behind a furious Fiend Cultivatress.The next moment, Luo Jianqing walked to the backyard of the tailor shop, gazing at the firmament, then a light-colored figure entered the yard. The latter bowed slightly, giving him a smile, \u201cSir, if you also want the Soul Summoning Streamer like the lady does, give it up, I have no intention of giving it to anyone.\u201dSlowly, Luo Jianqing turned back, fixing his eyes on the monk.Fo Zi didn\u2019t show any sign of being impressed by Luo Jianqing\u2019s resplendent visage when he saw his face.Luo Jianqing beamed, \u201cFo Zi?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 86": "Chapter 86 - The Essence of Karma! & The Master and the Book (II)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFo Zi gave Luo Jianqing a gentle smile, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a common name. Don\u2019t mind it.\u201dRealizing Luo Jianqing had no interest in the Soul Summoning Streamer, Fo Zi put down his vigilance and let go of the Buddha Beads Bracelet which he gripped so tightly. Luo Jianqing smiled elegantly, sizing him up in a friendly way, while Fo Zi was doing the same to the cultivator standing in front of him.Their eyes met in the air for a long time till Fo Zi broke the silence, \u201cCultivator Luo? The Great Disciple of Tai Hua Mountain \u2013 one of the legends from Luo River Thousand Autumn?\u201dHearing the Fo Zi\u2019s question, Luo Jianqing beamed, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing but a common name. Fo Zi, please don\u2019t mind it.\u201dWith an unexpected response like this, Fo Zi was impressed. A short moment after, he smiled and stepped towards Luo Jianqing, \u201cCultivator Luo, you are destined to meet me today. Why don\u2019t you forge a karma with the Buddha? How do you like it? If you are interested in Buddhism, then, from now on, you can enter the world of Buddhism just like\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing chuckled, \u201cI have no intention to become a monk.\u201dRealizing Luo Jianqing has taken him wrong, Fo Zi explained, \u201cWhat I was trying to say is that you are destined to have a connection with Buddhism, so, if you like, we can forge a karma, and from then on, if you come to our sect, we will treat you with Benefactor Standard.\u201dLuo Jianqing finally relieved.They exchanged glances and burst into laughter.From the first moment Luo Jianqing saw Fo Zi, he believed that this monk would be a friend that worth to get to know with. Actually, Fo Zi was thinking the same thing. The \u201cforging karma\u201d thing was just a pretext. Fo Zi was born with Intelligence Eyes and already cleared five of the six sense bases. It took him just a glance to know Luo Jianqing was an extraordinary cultivator.During Fo Zi and Yun Xiang\u2019s confrontation, Luo Jianqing accidentally chuckled and revealed his Spiritual Sense to Fo Zi. Now, two young legendary cultivators were sitting in a humble, moonlit yard, chatting, laughing.Fo Zi told Luo Jianqing that he came to Yun State for an auction.Although there was no major sect located within Yun State, the second grand Chamber of Commerce headquartered here. Three days later, the Liu Yun Chamber of Commerce\u2019s Decennial Grand Auction would take place. Gui Yuan Sect was not far from Yun State. Fo Zi was told that a Buddha Beads would be auctioned there. That\u2019s why he was here.The moment Fo Zi stepped on Yun State, he sensed a wisp of Enmity Qi, so he traced the Qi which led him to Yun Xiang.That made sense, Luo Jianqign thought, but there\u2019s still one thing he was concerned, \u201cIs it really the Buddha Beads that brought you here?\u201dFo Zi smiled gently, \u201cYes.\u201dLuo Jianqing was confused. Why didn\u2019t Fo Zi come to the Yun State in his previous life to meet Yun Xiang? Did something go wrong that led to all this unexpectedness?As if he could read Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind, Fo Zi explained, \u201cIn fact, Cultivator Yan and I had agreed to have another contest tomorrow. Last time I surrendered at the very start, which made him feel like he doesn\u2019t deserve the victory, so he challenged me again before he went to Tai Hua Mountain. However, Cultivator Yan gave in to his Internal Demons during the Septennial Competition. He is confined in the Duan Hun Sect for the elimination of Internal Demons, so our contest has to be delayed.\u201dFinally, Luo Jianqing understood what was going on with the derailed plots.It was him who accidentally changed the events that linked to each other. If he knew Fo Zi would come to Yun State, there was no need for him to come and prohibit Li Xiuchen\u2019s sordid harassment, he would probably, no, definitely stay at the Yu Xiao Peak with his Master.Nonetheless, if looking at the things from another angle, Luo Jianiqng wouldn\u2019t have a chance to know this brilliant friend if he stayed at Tai Hua Mountain.Fo Zi realized that it was time for him to leave after they had chatted for a little longer. Before he flew up to the air, both of them were surprised by the voice penetrated the rooftop of the lodge and reached their ears.They exchanged their glances. Luo Jianqing said, \u201cFo Zi, you heard that as well. That Fiend Cultivatress has been cursing you for three hours.\u201dFo Zi shook his head helplessly, \u201cThat lady is possessed by her colossal obsession.\u201d\u201cSince you already knew she is a Fiend Cultivator, why didn\u2019t you kill her in the lodge? \u2018Eliminate the Fiend Cultivators\u2019, remember? All of them are our enemies, there\u2019s no exception.\u201dFo Zi smiled, \u201cCultivator Luo, do you truly think this way?\u201dLuo Jianqing replied him with an appealing smile.\u201cIndeed, we should kill all the Fiend Cultivators, but I have owed the lady a Cause the moment we met. This, after all, is her Soul Summoning Streamer. I snatched it in order to deliver the souls into samsara, and I should give her a Consequence in return. As a peripatetic, I travel in this world, leaving behind no fragmented karma. A Cause would always trigger a Consequence. This is reason why I did all of these.\u201dFo Zi\u2019s pleasant voice eased Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind. The latter was led into an ethereal zone by his words.In this world, what was Cause? What was Consequence?Several years ago in the Liu Yan Valley, Luo Jianqing stole Yan Su\u2019s thunder in the battle \u2013 this was a Cause. Therefore, Yan Su and other grand sects came to the Septennial Competition to put pressure on Tai Hua Mountain and in the end, they had a rivalry \u2013 this was a Consequence. Later on, he defeated Yan Su, earning all the praise and accomplishment while his opponent was left badly wounded and fell into Possession \u2013 this, however, forged another karma.Yan Su was confined by Duan Hun Sect\u2019s Elders to undergo purgation so that the duel was delayed, making Fo Zi available to come to Yun State \u2013 this was also a Consequence.Driven by the Heavenly Will, everything was shrouded by a gigantic web of causality, destined to bear the karma that they deserved. Well, here comes a peculiar one: Li Xiuchen. What Cause had he planted that could bring him such abundant Consequences? He never created any Cause, obviously, then why on earth he deserved all these Consequences that shouldn\u2019t have belonged to him at all?The Heavenly Will\u2019s perfection was broken! It made a mistake!In a sudden, Luo Jianqing cleared all the trivial thoughts in mind and reached inner peace. The cultivation base that has remained in stagnation for almost two years skyrocketed. Tremendous amount of Spiritual Power dashed toward Luo Jianqing like whirlwind. A stream of invisible power grabbed every wisp of Spiritual Power, trying its best to stuff them into Luo Jianqing\u2019s vines.Watching his friend\u2019s expression turned sacred, Fo Zi smiled and flicked his sleeve, casting a protection ward for Luo Jianqing, and then sit down to guard the latter\u2019s breakthrough.One day later, Luo Jianqing finally opened his eyes.Right now, he\u2019s reached middle-stage Nascent Soul Period!Luo Jianqing breathed out a mouthful of thick air and turned around to face Fo Zi, \u201cThank you for having my back!\u201dFo Zi stood up, casting a spell to dry his bedewed frock, and gave Luo Jianqing a delightful smile, \u201cCongratulations!\u201dEyes meeting in the middle of the air, they beamed again.Fo Zi didn\u2019t linger any longer. After all, he needed to get prepared for chanting the Soul Summoning Streamer, so Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t detain him. Watching Fo Zi\u2019s figure disappeared in the tip of clouds, Luo Jianqing frowned, \u201cI heard tin my previous life that a Fiend Cultivator sacrificed herself in order to save Fo Zi\u2019s life in the Human-Demon War\u2026\u201dPondering it for a little longer, Luo Jianqing shook his head, smiling, \u201cWell, maybe I remember it wrong.\u201dThe Heavenly Will shouldn\u2019t make any mistake! The Cause and Consequence should always come along!For now, even Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t realize that a tiny seed of Cause he had sowed could bear such an intertwined fruit of Consequence, which drove Fo Zi to meet the Fiend Cultivatress today. The karma of this life had just started. The girl sacrificed her life in exchange for a Cause. Not just the Soul Summoning Streamer, what the monk owed her deserved a life-long payback.Luo Jianqing stayed at the tailor shop for another two days. After paying some extra gold, he left the shop tailing Li Xiuchen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 87": "Chapter 87 - The Essence of Karma! & The Master and the Book (III)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayLi Xiuchen was desperately depressed. He had been staying in the bathtub for two days, even having meals there, but he didn\u2019t see any sign of a beauty falling from above. On the last day, he began to curse the god. In the room next door, however, Luo Jianqing was overjoyed at Li Xiuchen\u2019s depression.On the third day, Li Xiuchen had to attend that auction.The book only wrote that Li Xiuchen attended the auction held in Yun State just for fun, and \u201csaved\u201d Yunxiang without much extra effort. But Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t expect that the auction was so magnificent, which was not detailed in the book.Of course, Li Xiuchen got several real treasures among worthless things at the auction, which was elaborated in the book, while other meaningless things were omitted. This time, Luo Jianqing had received the invitation from Fo Zi long ago and decided to go to the box of Gui Yuan Sect to attend the auction with him.Hardly had Li Xiuchen left the lodge when Luo Jianqing left the tailor shop.Watching Li Xiuchen\u2019s receding figure, Luo Jiangqing turned to the lodge. He suddenly recalled, \u201cI heard in my previous life that Li Xiuchen lost his beloved girl. That\u2019s why he practiced harder? To bring her back to life?\u201dAfter a careful thought, Luo Jianqing still failed to recall any details.It didn\u2019t take long before Luo Jianqing got to the auction ahead of Li Xiuchen. Luo Jianqing wore a silver mask and showed his invitation to two Foundation Establishment cultivators at the entrance, who let him in immediately.Soon, he entered the box of Gui Yuan Sect and saw Fo Zi already sitting there.Fo Zi was baffled by his silver mask.Luo Jianqing explained, \u201cIt can help me avoid troubles sometimes.\u201dFo Zi smiled and nodded, \u201cYes, your handsome face really needs a mask to avoid troubles.\u201dLuo Jianqing sat down and said, \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t care about people\u2019s appearance.\u201dFo Zi shook his head, \u201cAppearance is closely related to the mind. You have been well-known in the world, but you never avoid talking about your appearance, so why should I? Besides, you can look beyond the appearance and focus on your mind, that\u2019s why you are able to forge a karma with Buddha.\u201dLuo Jianqing couldn\u2019t restrain his smile and realized that he befriended a brilliant man.They sat in the box and soon Luo Jianqing saw Li Xiuchen coming to the hall on the first floor and sitting on a public seat. He gave some casual looks at Li Xiuchen and then proceeded his talk with Fo Zi about the Buddhist scriptures and doctrines.Fo Zi was also quite willing to discuss these things with Luo Jianqing. They chatted vigorously until the start of the auction.At the same time, fifty thousand kilometers away from them, on Tai Hua Mountain.Xuan Lingzi had cultivated indoor and rested for several days. Now, his injured primordial life finally recovered. The surging Spiritual Power formed a vortex on the top of Yu Xiao Peak. Xuan Lingzi opened his eyes and dissipated the vortex with a wave, and then stood up.Dressed in the plainest white clothes without any fancy patterns, Xuan Lingzi still looked handsome and attractive. He came to his bookshelf and began to look for something. He swept his long finger through these books and suddenly, he stopped.His nice eyebrows slightly knitted as he quickly took out a book that he had never seen.\u201cSpring Breeze Stroke Record?\u201dXuan Lingzi looked down with an indifferent face and opened this book. Then\u2026\u201c!\u201dXuan Lingzi had always been strict with himself. He knew most ways of practicing and all the cultivating methods of seven peaks in Tai Hua Mountain. But before that, he had even not known the Couple Cultivation, so he had obeyed the rules and principles strictly.Besides, in his mind, the Couple Cultivation was not a special thing, no more than a way of practicing for disciples. That was why he had asked Luo Jianqing \u201cDo you know what Couple Cultivation is?\u201d and then directly demonstrated it himself.Of course, that attempt also gave Xuan Lingzi a stir.Although only one third of his primordial life entered Luo Jianqing\u2019s body and integrated with him, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s belief in Dao had already been shaken and he couldn\u2019t forget that subtle feeling for whole night. What if his primordial life completely entered Luo Jianqing\u2019s body and integrated with him? Xuan Lingzi had imagined that kind of feeling.However, all of these were far less shocking than this book, Spring Breeze Stroke Record.Luo Jianqing had no idea what Xuan Lingzi had gone through. He had completely forgotten that he had put an obscene book on his master\u2019s shelf. At this moment, the auction had started. Luo Jianqing sat in the box and looked calmly at the participants sitting on the public seats, who were busy making bids.At first, the auctioned objects were just ordinary things, which might be attractive for rouge cultivators, yet far from satisfactory for Luo Jianqing and Fo Zi.Luo Jianqing just watched the first dozen of objects being sold, without making any bid.On the stage, a young auctioneer awkwardly looked at a box that was just presented to him, and then he smiled, \u201cThe next treasure is an interspatial ring, which was found on the edge of the darkest land. It has been examined by the elder of our Liu Yun Chamber of Commerce. This ring is part of a whole set of powerful magic instruments. If all the instruments are collected, the effect will be multiplied! It can accommodate things of 1000 cubic meters. The price will start from 30,000!\u201d\u201c30,000!\u201d Somebody shouted as the auctioneer stopped speaking.\u201c32,000!\u201d\u201c33,000!\u201dEven if the story about the ring was true, it was extremely hard to collect all the instruments.Double instruments, double effect, it was a common sense. But it was not so easy to collect a whole set of powerful instruments, and that was why not so many participants were enthusiastic about this ring.When the bid reached 50,000, the auction fell into silence.The auctioneer began to hype again, \u201cAs long as you collect all the powerful instruments, it is at least an Earth Level serie!\u201d\u201c52,000\u201d, another bid came. The auctioneer thought that would be the final bid, so he began to count down. \u201c60,000!\u201d An unexpected bid shocked everyone.Many people looked at that boy with a strange look and murmured, \u201cAn interspatial ring with a storage of 1000 cubic-meter is not worth of 60,000. He can get one with utmost 40,000 in other shops. Stupid lad.\u201dThe auctioneer\u2019s eyes shined, and he asked, \u201cAny other bid?\u201dNo response, of course.In the hall, Li Xiuchen was waiting for the countdown confidently. However, just as the auctioneer said \u201c60,000, for the first time\u201d, a voice from the second-floor box came. It was low but clear, with an obvious smiling tone,\u201c70,000!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were all astonished by the 70,000 bid.The box was totally private and isolated. The wall of the box could block spiritual sense. Therefore, except the elders of Tribulation Passage, no one could know who was in the box.\u201cOnly the rich and powerful cultivators had the access to the box, so why did he buy a mere 1,000 cubic-meter interspatial ring?\u201d\u201cOf course, he has a more ambitious plan. He wants to collect the whole set for sure!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s too hard. If he is that rich, he can just make a set himself.\u201dPeople chirped in the hall, but most of them just waited to see what would happen next. For them, 70,000 had reached the roof. There was no more chance for a higher bid. However, just as the auctioneer shouted \u201c70,000, second, last chance\u201d, Li Xiuchen gritted his teeth and raised his bidding paddle, \u201c71,000!\u201dAll the people were baffled. They looked at Li Xiuchen with confusion.Then, the voice came from the box again, \u201c80,000.\u201dLi Xiuchen gritted his teeth harder, \u201c81,000!\u201d\u201c90,000.\u201d The voice from the box was still calm and poised.Hearing this bid, everyone was taken aback, and the auctioneer\u2019s hands were shaking. He shouted hurriedly, \u201c90,000! 90,000! Any other bid? Anyone!\u201dThe market price for the interspatial ring with such quality was just around 35,000, utmost 40,000. Without the \u201cwhole set story\u201d, it wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to be presented at this auction. No matter what, no one had expected that its price tripled!\u201dStarted from 30,000, its price now reached 90,000. These two men just spent money like water.Li Xiuchen clutched the paddle, unable to say anything. The auctioneer gave him a disappointed look and began to count down. When he counted to \u201ctwice\u201d, Li Xiuchen struggled to shout, \u201c91,000!\u201dIt seemed he was exhausted to offer this bid, but right after that, the man in the box smiled and said calmly, \u201c100,000.\u201dThese three words completely beat Li Xiuchen.100,000, a price could not be higher. Besides, Li Xiuchen still needed money to buy other things, so after a slight struggle, he gave up. Ultimately, that man in the box won the ring.For such a little thing, the bidder could get it right after this round of auction.When the server of Liu Yun Chamber of Commerce sent the ring to the box, Luo Jianqing took out 100,000 cashes from his own interspatial ring and gave the server. After he got the interspatial ring, he just appreciated it for a while and then put it in his own interspatial ring, even not wearing it.Seeing that, Fo Zi put his palms together and smiled, \u201cAmitabha. Cultivator Luo, I\u2019m very curious. You were confident to win this ring and paid a lot for it, but now, you just put it in your own ring and don\u2019t wear it, why?\u201dHearing his words, Luo Jianqing poured a cup of tea for him and said, \u201cYou\u2019re right. I want this ring so I get it. But my own ring is the gold core gift bestowed by my master Sir Yu Qingzi during my Core Formation, with 5,000 cubic meter capacity, so I\u2019ve never intended to replace it.\u201dFo Zi looked at Luo Jianqing with clear eyes. He just smiled, not continuing this topic.Soon, people\u2019s enthusiasm about the \u201c100,000 interspatial ring\u201d has faded. The auction started again.Luo Jianqing only bought another piece of treasure, a fine thousands-year-old ice essence. Last time, when Luo Jianqing gave his sixth fellow brother a Zhongqi stone, he was very happy. He told Luo Jianqing that he was making an instrument, yet lacked several materials, including ice essence.Luo Jianqing paid even more for the ice essence, so other people were more curious about who was sitting inside that box.Fo Zi smiled, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that you would be so liberal with money.\u201dLuo Jianqing was a little bit embarrassed, \u201cThis is a gift for my sixth fellow brother. He is an instrument maker, obsessed with Qi condensation. In order to make more powerful instruments, his cultivation was hindered.\u201dFo Zi nodded with respect, \u201cXiu Hen, the sixth of Tai Hua\u2019s seven cultivators. I know him.\u201d Luo Jianqing nodded with a smile, and Fo Zi continued, \u201cIt is a bless for him to have such a brilliant fellow brother like you.\u201dHearing that, Luo Jianqing was a little baffled. He murmured subconsciously, \u201cIs it? I doubt it\u2026\u201dThese abrupt words might confuse others, but for Fo Zi, it was just an ordinary sentence. Fo Zi was counting the white beads in his hand, while a smile was worn on his face full of sympathy, \u201cIt takes three previous incarnations to become fellow brothers; five previous incarnations to become best friends. It is all about karma. You have been caring him so much, so of course, you are a bless for him.\u201dLuo Jianqing suddenly feel enlightened and relieved. He bowed to Fo Zi and expressed his respect, \u201cThanks for your guidance.\u201dFo Zi smiled slightly.They chatted a while in the box, then a Buddhist Pearl was presented on the stage-this was exactly what Fo Zi wanted. The pearl was round and crystal-clear. Even if the box was protected by enchantment, Luo Jianqing could clearly feel the supreme and profound Buddhist aura given out from that Pearl.This time, the price started from 100,000; each bid should be at least 10,000 higher.Just as the auctioneer finished, Fo Zo offered his bid in a low voice, \u201c200,000.\u201dThe whole hall fell into an uproar. Even the experienced auctioneer was shocked.Luo Jianqing was about to drink the tea. He hadn\u2019t drunk yet, otherwise he must have spitted it out.He looked at Fo Zi with surprise and asked in a low voice: \u201cFo Zi, what are you doing\u2026\u201dFo Zi had always been calm and graceful, but now he smiled awkwardly, \u201cI am not good at these worldly stuffs.\u201dLuo Jianqing: \u201c\u2026\u201d This was not the excuse for him to bid casually!!!The audience might have been frightened by Fo Zi\u2019s bid, none of whom offered new bid currently. After all, this pearl was essential for Buddha Cultivation, while for other cultivators, it was just an ornament to exorcise evil spirits and calm themselves down.Liu Yun Chamber of Commerce\u2019s expected price on this pearl was 250,000, but everyone now was taken aback by Fo Zi\u2019s bid, so the auctioneer continued to hype, \u201cIt\u2019s said that this pearl originally belonged to a Buddhist master who died in a sitting posture and then became the Buddha. I think everyone knows this master\u2019s name. He was one of the four grand masters of Buddhist Chan Sect, Grand Master Dao Xin.Hearing that, someone couldn\u2019t help bidding, \u201c210,000.\u201d\u201cThree hundred thou\u2026\u201d Fo Zi was about to immediately bid 300,000.But Luo Jianqing interrupted him, \u201c250,000!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 89": "Chapter 89 - Scrambling for Treasures at Auction (II)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn order to protect the guests\u2019 privacy, the voice was already processed when it came out of the box. Thus, the other bidders were astonished that there were actually two mysterious guys in Luo Jianqing\u2019s box. Fo Zi was even more surprised when he heard Luo Jianqing calling out the bid for him. The latter sighed, \u201cFo Zi, now is the moment that I finally changed my mind \u2013 the Heavenly Will is still\u2026fair. For instance, it endowed you with great wisdom.\u201dBut it didn\u2019t give you an equal amount of EQ!Of course, Fo Zi knew what he meant though Luo Jianqing swallowed the rest of that sentence.Not irritated at all, Fo Zi postured a Buddhism salute with calm and elegance, \u201cAmitabha, please, Cultivator Luo, help me to bid.\u201dLuo Jianqing asked him, \u201cMay I know how much in maximum do you want to spend on this Buddhism Bead?\u201dFo Zi pondered for a moment, \u201cThree hundred thousand.\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201d Who on earth gave you the confidence to bid a straight-forward two hundred thousand at the very beginning?!The bid offered by Luo Jianqing silenced the auction house. Everyone was shocked by the extravagance of the mysterious man in the box. However, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t dare to lower his guard. Looking down from the window at Li Xiuchen who was sitting in the hall, Luo Jianqing squinted.As an inner-door disciple of Tai Hua Mountain, Li Xiuchen\u2019s monthly salary was only five hundred Spiritual Stones, but that was certainly not what he got in total. Although in this life Luo Jianqing snatched lots of opportunities from Li Xiuchen, the latter still came out of Liu Yan Valley with hundreds of Yan Fruit, plus what he reaped from the Wan Shou Mountain, as Luo Jianqing estimated, Li Xiuchen at least owned hundreds of thousands of Spiritual Stones.The Demon Beasts that he killed in the Wan Shou Mountian weren\u2019t that profitable. What contributed the most for his wealth was the Yan Fruit.A hundred Yan Fruits can even fetch a million Spiritual Bone in the auction house. Because of its rarity, Yan Fruit was an invaluable magic item for the cultivators of Fire-related Maneuvers. Li Xiuchen sold all of the Yan Fruits as soon as he got out of the Liu Yan Valley. Although he didn\u2019t sell them in an auction, he still made a fortune.According to the book, the second item that Li Xiuchen bid for was\u2026 the Buddhism Bead!As Luo Jianqing expected, when everyone else gave it up, Li Xiuchen raised the bid card, \u201cTwo hundred and sixty thousand!\u201dFo Zi wasn\u2019t expecting that, \u201cIt is that cultivator again!\u201dLuo Jianqing called out with confidence, \u201cTwo hundred and eighty thousand.\u201dLi Xiuchen continued, \u201cTwo hundred and ninety thousand!\u201dLuo Jianqing said with a smile, \u201cThree hundred thousand.\u201dLi Xiuchen hesitated. Obviously, his estimated maximum bid was three hundred thousand as well.Luo Jianqing waited for Li Xiuchen\u2019s decision calmly. \u2018Now, give it up\u2019, he thought, staring at him. Nonetheless, to Luo Jianqing\u2019s surprise, Li Xiuchen called out the bid again, \u201cThree hundred and ten thousand!\u201dLuo Jianqing was astonished.How precious this Buddhism Bead was that it even made Li Xiuchen kept bidding?Surely, Luo Jianqing had no idea what Li Xiuchen\u2019s going to use this Buddhism Bead for. Seeking Immortality II only mentioned that Li Xiuchen got these items, nothing else. He knew the story about the Interspatial Ring because, at the end of the book, Li Xiuchen did find a sword that belonged to the same item set of the ring, making it possible to successfully collect the whole set in the future.What about this Buddhism Bead?Li Xiuchen might be the only one who knew what it truly was.Sensing Li Xiuchen\u2019s determination to get the item, Fo Zi said, \u201cCultivator Luo, it seems that Cultivator values this Buddhism Bead so much. We should probably stop bidding and let him have it.\u201dRecalling what Li Xiuchen had done, Luo Jianqing frowned and shook his head, \u201cFo Zi, I don\u2019t think we can give it up this easily.\u201d So he bided again, \u201cThree hundred and fifty thousand!\u201dHearing the bid was raised for forty thousand, Li Xiuchen shut up his mouth. He hesitated for a while then shouted out the bid again, \u201cThree hundred sixty thousand!\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201cFour hundred thousand!\u201dLi Xiuchen, \u201cFour hundred and ten thousand!\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled and sipped the tea. In a calm tone, he bid, \u201cFive hundred thousand.\u201dEveryone fixed their eyes on the box located on the second floor. Fo Zi laughted and slightly shook his head. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t regret what he called out. The price was way too high. Fetching a total of five hundred thousand, the bead was now valued twice as much as the auctioneers hoped for! Immediately, Li Xiuchen gave it up. He could do nothing but kept glaring over Luo Jianqing\u2019s box angrily.When the Buddhism Bead was delivered to their box, Fo Zi paid for it before Luo Jianqing took out the Spiritual Stones from his Interspatial Ring. Confused, Luo Jianqing looked at Fo Zi and heard the latter explained, \u201cCultivator Luo, you bid the item in order to help me. It would be inappropriate to let you pay for it.\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled, \u201cWell, I guess, I will not be the destined owner of this Buddhism Bead.\u201d\u201cYou want this bead? Then I shall give it to you as a gift, forging karma.\u201dSeeing Fo Zi about to give the Buddhism Bead to him for real, Luo Jianqing stopped him at once. Limpid eyes fixed on Fo Zi who was standing in front of him ethereally, Luo Jianqing sighed, \u201cYou are so much better than me in terms of Buddhism Destiny. This Buddhism Bead belongs to you of course, given that you\u2019ve already paid for it.\u201dLuo Jianqing asked his friend when they sat down, \u201cFo Zi, do you really know what indeed this Buddhism Bead is?\u201d\u201cNot really. Maybe it really is the heirloom of the Fourth Grand Master of Buddha Sect.\u201dLuo Jianqing laughed and shook his head slightly, \u201cFor sure, it once belonged to that Grand Master, but definitely not a magic item. This, actually, is a Buddhist Relic.\u201dFo Zi was shocked by the truth. The calmness hanging on his face was finally broken. He stopped fiddling the bead at once. Not long after he realized what he really got, craziness filled his eyes. Luo Jianqing was astonished by Fo Zi\u2019s anomaly. The monk stared at the bead obsessively as if he was looking at the one and only precious thing in his life.After a long time, the glow of madness glittering in his eyes gradually faded.Fo Zi lifted his head, \u201cCultivator Luo, before you told me, I didn\u2019t realize that this is a Buddhist Relic at all. How did you\u2026 figure it out?\u201dWhen he asked Luo Jianqing the question, though Fo Zi tried his best to conceal his emotions, Luo Jianqing still managed to sense a wisp of nervousness in his voice.He never saw Fo Zi acting like this. Pondering for a while, Luo Jianqing summoned a child from his Interspatial Ring.When the delicate child revealed himself in the box, a light aroma of pill dispersed and fulfilled the box immediately. The lovely child frowned, and with his action, the aroma vanished at once, as mysterious as its presence.Fo Zi stared at the child with astonishment. Luo Jianqing introduced the child to him, \u201cThis is\u2026 one of my Item Souls. His name is Qing Jun.\u201dNo living creature can be stored in the Interspatial Ring. Moreover, Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t tell Fo Zi that Qing Jun was actually a Pill Soul of a Godlike Pill, so he had to make up an identity for Qing Jun. It was not that Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t trust Fo Zi, but, because of the rarity of the Godlike Pill, once the words spread out, people would definitely take pains to wrest for it.Fo Zi looked at Qing Jun in confusion, and then he heard the child spoke in a bleak voice, \u201cThousands of years ago, I served by my master\u2019s side, and with him I saw what remained of the Fourth Grand Master of Buddha Sect. My master tried to take this Buddhist Relic from his skeleton. However, he was thwarted by the last wisp of Spiritual Sense of the Fourth Grand Master, who told my master that he would choose the owner of his relic, a destined one.\u201dHearing Qing Jun\u2019s words, Fo Zi was suddenly transfixed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 90": "Chapter 90 - Scrambling for Treasures at Auction (III)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayQing Jun told him, \u201cI know what you want to say: it\u2019s said that the Fourth Grand Master had entered the Pure Land, how come there are any skeleton left? Nonetheless, what I know is that, for tens of thousands of years, none of the cultivators had been transformed to deity, not a single one of them. You were born with great wisdom and had cleared five of the six sense bases. If you can get over the one and only tribulation in your life, perhaps you will have the chance to be the first Buddhist Cultivator who enters the Pure Land over the past thousands of years.\u201dFo Zi bowed with gratitude, \u201cThank you for informing me.\u201dQing Jun waved his hand and took a seat, serving himself a cup of tea.Fo Zi didn\u2019t ask Luo Jianqing where he got such an intimidating Item Soul, instead, he was sunk into his own thoughts. When there were only several items left for bidding, the auction almost came to an end. Luo Jianqing asked his friend, \u201cFo Zi, Qing Jun mentioned that you need to overcome a tribulation\u2026?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. Nine years ago, my destiny has changed abruptly overnight. I once cleared all my six roots of sense bases, but, the day after that night, my Master foresaw a tribulation befalling me. However, I don\u2019t really consider it a bad thing. I won\u2019t be able to ferry myself through the vast sea of mortal vanity without getting over the tribulation. There is no way to ferry over the ocean when your boat is not even touching the sea. Therefore, I\u2019m not taking it as a big deal.\u201dLuo Jianqing frowned subtly, \u201cNine years ago\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing was sensitive to this number. Nine years ago, Li Xiuchen came to Tai Hua Mountain and became an inner-door disciple; nine years ago, he woke up and found that he was reincarnated. Besides, he never heard anything about the tribulation of Fo Zi in his last life. Could it be another triggered change?It was hard to tell.The last item of today\u2019s auction was finally revealed \u2013 a broken sword. When the mutilated sword was presented, Luo Jianqing suddenly shivered and sensed a colossal amount of willpower from his Interspatial Ring.So, this is it, he thought, the other half of the broken sword which he reaped from Wan Shou Mountain.Several Months ago when Luo Jianiqng followed Li Xiuchen to the battle field of Qing Jun and the Demon Beast, he plundered every valuable items left on the field before Li Xiuchen even woke up. That was how he got a half of the sword. Even though the sword was broken, it still contained coercion as powerful as a Heaven-level magic item. Therefore, there was no doubt that the sword would be a high-grade Heaven-level magic item after the re-forging!Luo Jianqing\u2019s own sword, Floating Frost Sword, was only a Superior-grade Earth-level item, while this broken sword was three grades higher than it.Among all the magic items that Luo Jianqign saw in his life, except Xuan Lingzi\u2019s sword, none of the item could match with this broken sword. Xuan Ling Sword was a Superior-grade Heaven-level item which was cultivated by Xuan Lingzi\u2019s Primordial Life for three hundred years. Undoubtedly, Xuan Ling Sword could strengthen the sword-holder\u2019s power, endowing the holder with the ability to kill a cultivator even if the cultivator achieved higher cultivation base than the sword-holder.For instance, it enabled a late-stage Foundation Establishment Period cultivator to pierce through a late-stage Gold Core Period cultivator\u2019s heart.When the memory was recalled, Luo Jianqing could now face it with calmness. His internal demon had been conquered.On the platform, the auctioneer was advertising the item, \u201cThough there is only half of the sword, this broken piece is still a Heaven-level magic item! As you all know, the Heaven-level item would be imprinted with its previous owner\u2019s insight towards the records. The original owner of this broken sword was probably a Deity Transformation Period cultivator. The reserve price is five hundred thousand with an increment of fifty thousand by each bid!\u201dAs a Heaven-level item, five hundred thousand was nothing. If the sword wasn\u2019t broken, there wouldn\u2019t be any issue to raise the reserve price to five million. Soon, many bidders raised their bid card, \u201cFive hundred and fifty thousand\u201d, \u201cSix hundred thousand\u201d, \u201cSeven hundred thousand\u201d.However, some doubting voice could be heard over the babble of voices, \u201cA broken Heaven-level sword might influence our insight of record. Sounds so easy to get Qi Deviation.\u201d\u201cYou are right. After all, this is a broken sword. What should we do if we lose the rein while cultivating with it?\u201dThe auction for this Heaven-level item was far less popular than the auctioneer thought it would be, but before he decided to put in all his efforts to catch the bidders\u2019 attention on this sword, Li Xiuchen raised his bidder card, \u201cNine hundred thousand!\u201dHe added two hundred thousand more than the last highest price!Many were shocked by his bid and gave up bidding. Seeing the auction house was silenced, Luo Jianqing smiled subtly, about to call out the price. However, an unexpected voice came out of the box next to Luo Jianqing\u2019s, \u201cOne million!\u201dShocked, Li Xiuchen clenched his teeth, \u201cOne point one million!\u201dHe didn\u2019t have that much in his pocket right now, but Li Xiuchen decided to sell some of his belongings. Although he didn\u2019t get the other half of the broken sword at the Wan Shou Mountain, he still believed that it wouldn\u2019t be destroyed accidentally \u2013 it must have been dropped somewhere on the mountain range. He deemed that as long as he got this half from the auction, there was a great chance for him to find the other half using the interaction between the two pieces of the sword!The bidder sitting in the box let out a pleasant laughter, \u201cOne point two million.\u201dLi Xiuchen insisted, \u201cOne\u2026 one point two five million.\u201dCompared to his trembling voice, the laughing of the other bidder sounded much more confident, \u201cOne point five million, then.\u201dThis bidding set the auction on fire.A piece of the broken sword was offered a bidding of one point five million! This was totally unheard of!Li Xiuchen could do nothing but give up the bidding. He clenched his teeth and kept glaring at two boxes located on the second floor \u2013 one was Luo Jianqing and Fo Zi\u2019s box, because Luo Jianqing almost snatched away everything that Li Xiuchen tried to bid for. The other one was the box set next to theirs, given that the owner of the box eliminated every bit of hope for Li Xiuchen to get the broken sword.Hearing the offer, the auctioneer was super excited, he chanted for the bidding to close, \u201cOne point five million going once, one point five million going twice, one\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing called out the bid, \u201cTwo million.\u201dThe whole crowd became quiet. The auction house was now tranquil enough even to hear the sound of a needle dropping on the ground.The next moment, an enraged voice came out of the next box, \u201cTwo point five million!\u201d\u201cThree million.\u201d\u201cFour million!\u201dLuo Jianqing smiled, \u201cFive million.\u201dBang!Suddenly, from the next box came the sound of breaking furniture, as if something had been overthrown. The bidder called out fiercely, \u201cSix million!\u201d, then added a threat, \u201cWho the hell are you?! How dare you bid the item against a woman like me? Are you out of your mind?!\u201dLuo Jianqing was surprised to hear these words. He turned back to look at Fo Zi.The monk was looking at him in astonishment as well. Eyes meeting in the air, they both smiled.And then Luo Jianqing raised the bid again, \u201cEight million.\u201dYun Xiang who was sitting in the box next to theirs was shocked, \u201cHow dare you!\u201d. After struggling a while, she called out, \u201cTen million!\u201dFo Zi lowered his voice to persuade Luo Jianqing, \u201cAmitabha, Cultivator Luo, why are you bullying a girl?\u201dLuo Jianqing looked at Fo Zi innocently, \u201cFo Zi, actually eight million is the highest bid I can offer. I only have nine million Spiritual Stones left in my pocket.\u201d He didn\u2019t tell Fo Zi the other half of the sentence: half of the nine million Spiritual Stones were his Master\u2019s.Since both of them had confessed their love to each other, Xuan Lingzi gave Luo Jianqing his Interspatial Ring when Luo Jianqing was about to leave. Luo Jianqing found it a little bit weird to take away his lover\u2019s whole possessions with him, so he only took five million Spiritual Stones. A fair amount, right? But Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t think so, obviously. He was worried that Luo Jianqing wouldn\u2019t have enough money to spend.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 91": "Chapter 91 - Scrambling for Treasures at Auction (VI)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHearing that, Fo Zi asked, \u201cCultivator Luo, are you short of money?\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded.Fo Zi smiled, \u201cI still have three million spiritual stone. I can lend them to you.\u201dLuo Jianqing looked at him with widened eyes. Fo Zi said innocently, \u201cShe had cursed me for 6 hours, so let this three million spiritual stone teach her a lesson.\u201dLuo Jianqing laughed out.Now, Luo Jianqing immediately bided, \u201cTwelve million!\u201dYun Xiang was shocked. She shouted with shaking hands, \u201cWho the hell are you? Why do you come after me? This broken sword is only worth of two million at most.\u201dLuo Jianqing chuckled slightly, \u201cMy fellow, this is the rule of the auction. The one offers the highest bid wins. As long as I am willing to, I can even spend a hundred million to buy it.\u201dYun Xiang, \u201c\u2026\u201dTill now, Liu Yun Chamber of Commerce\u2019s decennial auction formally ended.Some left with many desirable treasures; some bought nothing, but witnessed a unique \u201cwealth flaunting\u201d competition, which they could brag for the next ten years.Li Xiuchen was one of them, as he got nothing. However, he was dissatisfactory and even furious. Yun Xiang, on the other hand, only bided for one treasure but failed to get it, so she was also mad.Fo Zi was beaming. He won the Buddhist Relic; Luo Jianqing owed Fo Zi three million spiritual stone, but he got what he wanted. They left the auction and intended to leave Yun State. They could still go on the same path for now, so Fo Zi invited Luo Jianqing to visit Gui Yuan Sect, but Luo Jianqing declined politely, \u201cI have left Tai Hua Mountain for several days, so I\u2019m quite homesick.\u201dFo Zi smiled, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect you were a homesick man.\u201dLuo Jianqing also responded with a smile, \u201cHome becomes home when your beloved one live inside. Sometimes, what I miss is not home, but the ones living there.\u201dFo Zi nodded, \u201cI see you love them so much. You have bought a lot of things for your fellows at auction.\u201dObviously, Fo Zi thought that Luo Jianqing was eager to go back as he missed his fellow brothers and sisters. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t deny that, as he did miss them. However, he missed that man more. Luo Jianqing was not sure if that man also missed him.Luo Jianqing and Fo Zi parted at the border of Yun State and Cen State.Clear water meandered through green hills. Two flash of lights streaked across the sky and came by a lake. Here, Luo Jianqing removed his silver mask, revealing his handsome and smiling face. He made an obeisance and said, \u201cFo Zi, we have to part from here.\u201dFo Zi counted the malas and smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s just like a dream to befriend with you. I will never forget you.\u201dLuo Jianqing was confused, \u201cIt\u2019s wired for you\u2026 to say that.\u201dFo Zi pretended to be surprised and said, \u201cI\u2019m afraid you misunderstand my words.\u201dThey exchanged a short glance with each other, and both laugh.Luo Jianqing said, \u201cThen, see you until next time!\u201dFo Zi said, \u201cAll right!\u201dAs they finished and was about to leave, a stream of jingling sounds came from the sky. The sounds were clear and pleasant, composing a pleasant melody.Luo Jianqing immediately looked back and Fo Zi also stopped. They joined each other and soon saw a pretty lady in black. When she saw Luo Jianqing, she said, \u201cYou! You are the person who scrambled my broken sword.\u201dLuo Jianqing looked at her indifferently and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t know what you are talking about.\u201dAnger appeared on her beautiful face, \u201cSo you refuse to admit it? My Tracking Bell tracked you down.\u201d\u201cNonsense.\u201d Luo Jianqing said.Before Yun Xiang continued, she saw Fo Zi standing beside Luo Jianqing. She was quite surprised and suddenly understood something, \u201cYou are a team! You and this monk first grabbed my Soul Summoning Streamer, making me attend this auction to buy birthday present for my master. Then you scrambled my broken sword, and now I cannot find any appropriate present! You did this on purpose!\u201dAs she finished, Yun Xiang rushed towards them and intended to attack Luo Jianqing.Frowning, Luo Jianqing dodged quickly. Yun Xiang took the chance to attack Fo Zi.Fo Zi didn\u2019t expect that she made a feint attack just now. Her real target was Fo Zi. It was too late for him to dodge. He grabbed Yun Xiang\u2019s hands subconsciously. Yun Xiang staggered and fell into his arms.In an instant, Yun Xiang smiled the slight fragrance of sandalwood, which brought her in a short trance.Fo Zi held Xiang Xiang\u2019s hand. It was inappropriate to push her away now, so Fo Zi just said awkwardly, \u201cAre you OK? Can you stand up?\u201dYun Xiang suddenly blushed. She pushed Fo Zi away and stammered, \u201cYou\u2019re r a monk of Gui Yuan Sect, but you don\u2019t behave like one\u2026You molested me! You abandon yourself to lust!\u201dFo Zi was stunned by her words, \u201cMiss, I don\u2019t understand. You fell into my arms yourself, nothing to do with me.\u201dYun Xiang\u2019s face was burning, as if blood was going to drop out. She stared at Fo Zi and was about to attack him, but somehow, she didn\u2019t. Then she turned to Luo Jianqing and raised her fist, \u201cI\u2019ll kill you first, as a compensation for the damn monk\u2019s molesting.\u201dFo Zi, \u201c\u2026\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201cIt has nothing to do with me!\u201dYun Xiang\u2019s face was redder, and she said furiously: \u201cI don\u2019t care!\u201dLuo Jianqing was speechless, \u201cAre you Fiend Cultivators all so unreasonable?\u201dYun Xiang immediately attacked him and didn\u2019t listen to him at all. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t want to bully a girl, so he just kept dodging. Every time Fo Zi wanted to help Luo Jianqing, Yun Xiang would shout, \u201cYou want to molest me again?\u201d So Fo Zi could only stand still embarrassedly.Although Yun Xiang\u2019s realm was two levels lower than Luo Jianqing, she was the disciple of Fiend Exalt after all. She was talented and fought viciously. Soon, she tore the clothes on his chest, leaving two angry bleeding cuts.The cuts were not deep, but Luo Jianqing frowned.Seeing that, Yun Xiang sneered and continued the attack. This time, she raised her right hand as a claw, targeting at Luo Jianqing\u2019s eyes. Suddenly, an angry voice came from the sky, \u201cYun Xiang! You bitch, stop right now!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(I)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTranslator: Sissy That WalkThe claws of Yun Xiang were approaching Luo Jianqing\u2019s chest, but suddenly, Luo Jianqing had formed a sword Qi on his hand, which was pressed right against her neck.A figure in blood-red had arrived from the sky.Just as Mo Qiu came, he quickly pulled Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand and pushed Yun Xiang away.Yun Xiang was stunned, \u201cMast\u2026Mo Qiu, why are you here?\u201dStaring at Yun Xiang who was in astonishment, Mo Qiu wore a serious face and said coldly, \u201cWhy am I here? That\u2019s exactly what I want to ask you. Why are you here? And Why did you attack my friend? You\u2019d better explain it.\u201dAt first, Mo Qiu had been quite cold and severe, but now he was milder. Even though he was less oppressive and horrible now, Yun Xiang was still so frightened. She stepped back a little and lowered her head.\u201c\u2026Your friend?\u201d Yun Xiang murmured.Mo Qiu didn\u2019t answer her question. Instead, he turned to Luo Jianqing, who smiled and raised his hand. Mo Qiu was baffled and then released Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand. He beamed and said, \u201cWhat? After all these days you just look at me like that? I thought you would say something nice.\u201dLuo Jianqing raised his eyebrow, \u201cSay what? I miss you much, Cultivator Mo?\u201dMo Qiu chuckled and didn\u2019t respond.Yun Xiang was still shocked, \u201c\u2026\u201dThen, Mo Qiu noticed Fo Zi who was standing aside with folded palms. Mo Qiu narrowed and fixed his eyes on Fo Zi, saying coldly, \u201cFo Zi Yu Chen from the Gui Yuan Sect.\u201dFo Zi nodded slightly, \u201cCultivator Mo Qiu, one of the Luo River Thousand Autumn?\u201dHearing that name, Mo Qiu was first baffled, and then curled his lip slightly, \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that I could meet such a master here. Luo Jianqing, you have always been accompanied by these awesome guys everywhere. My disci\u2026 friend is unable to kill you. While you didn\u2019t hurt her, it\u2019s inappropriate for you to tease her.\u201dLuo Jianqing said innocently, \u201cDon\u2019t you see the cuts on my chest?\u201dMo Qiu lowered his head and examined carefully.Now, the cuts had already mended, without any sign of a wound, but Mo Qiu still saw the torn clothes, so he knew Luo Jianqing had indeed been hurt.Seeing that, Mo Qiu again wore a grave face and turned to Yun Xiang. Before he could say anything, Yun Xiang had raised her hands, \u201cI\u2019m sorry! It\u2019s my fault. If I had known that he was your friend, I would not have attacked him. No, if I had known that he was the legendary Luo Jianqing, I would not have fought with him. I swear!\u201dAs she was saying, Yun Xiang blinked her eyes pitifully and stretched out four fingers to swear to God.Now she looked completely different from that arrogant and domineering woman she used to be, and Luo Jianqing chuckled. He didn\u2019t know the relationship between Mo Qiu and Yun Xiang, but he knew that Mo Qiu was such a talented Cultivator as it took him less than 60 years to reach late stage Nascent Soul. If he was willing to join the Fiend Palace, he would be put in an important position and even be highly thought of by the Fiend Exalt.It was said that in Fiend Cultivation, power mattered the most, so their relationship was quite understandable. After all, Mo Qiu\u2019s realm was inaccessible for Yun Xiang.Obviously, Yun Xiang\u2019s begging didn\u2019t win his mercy. Mo Qiu sneered and said, \u201cAre you blind? Look at his face, he is the only one who is more handsome than me and still alive in this world. Don\u2019t even try to deny it, ask for the punishment yourself after you return.\u201dYun Xiang immediately became subdued.This scene made Luo Jianqing more delightful. He said in a low voice, \u201cYou reprimanded the disciple from the Fiend Palace like this. Aren\u2019t you afraid of being recognized? And I am very curious since when you can reprimand the precious disciple of Fiend Exalt?\u201dMo Qiu raised his chin a little bit and beamed, \u201cNow, I\u2019m the pillar of the Fiend Palace. I am far more talented than that girl, so I\u2019m the new disciple of Fiend Exalt.\u201d After a pause, Mo Qiu continued, \u201cSo, are you concerned that my identity may be recognized?\u201d Then, he looked at Fo Zi.Fo Zi give him a slight smile and paid him respect.However, Mo Qiu just gave Fo Zi a glance and flipped his red sleeve, \u201cIf I kill him, no one will know my identity anymore.\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026Bullshit!\u201dThe smile on Fo Zi\u2019s face instantly froze. \u201c\u2026Amitabha, Amitabha. I should have stayed in Gui Yuan Sect\u2026\u201dYun Xiang suddenly became mad, \u201cWhy do you kill innocent people!\u201dMo Qiu was baffled and turned to that girl, \u201cYou got a lot of nerve to say that!\u201dYun Xiang\u2019s flame of momentum was quickly extinguished by a simple glance of Mo Qiu. She shrank, \u201cYou\u2026 you have told me that we Fiend Cultivators cannot kill innocent people. If we choose this evil path, we will be punished by Heaven Dao. Then, it will be extremely difficult for us to reach Deity Transformation Period, not to mention transforming to deity\u2026\u201dMo Qiu replied with a sneer, \u201cWell, I thought you have forgotten that!\u201dYun Xiang lowered her head, afraid to speak any more.Luo Jianqing sighed, \u201cMo Qiu, although you are halfway to reaching Out-of-Body realm, I don\u2019t allow you to bully Fo Zi. I only spent several days with him, but his profound understating on Buddhist doctrines really impressed me. Besides, he practiced well in the dharma of karma.Mo Qiu pressed his lips together and stared at Fo Zi.Fo Zi was counting the beads and sighed in his heart, \u201cReally, I shouldn\u2019t have left the Gui Yuan Sect\u2026\u201dOf Course, Mo Qiu was just kidding. He wouldn\u2019t kill Fo Zi. As he told Luo Jianqing, he had never and would never kill anyone. Meanwhile, Fo Zi didn\u2019t resent Fiend Cultivation. Otherwise, he would have killed Yun Xiang at the lodge when he first saw her instead of keeping her alive.Anyway, it was a pleasant surprise for Luo Jianqing to meet Mo Qiu here, but he was still longing to return to Tai Hua mountain.Suddenly, Mo Qiu said, I didn\u2019t expect that you would come to Yun State for me. I\u2019m surprised and flattered.\u201d\u201cCome Yun Sate for you?\u201d Luo Jianqing said subconsciously.Mo Qiu nodded confidently, \u201cYes. Before I left Tai Hua Mountain, I told you that I would go to Yun State to deal with something, remember?\u201d As he finished, Mo Qiu\u2019s face clouded, \u201cGod damn it, you are not here for me!\u201dLuo Jianqing, \u201c\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(II)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayIn a blink, Mo Qiu\u2019s scarlet scourge was unsheathed with a bloody glow \u2013 the man was clearly ready for a fight. Seeing Mo Qiu\u2019s irritation, Fo Zi stood aside with a mild smile, waiting to see how Luo Jianqing would handle his friend in rage. Mouth opening widely, Yun Xiang was totally in shock, and to be honest, one could probably stuff an egg inside her mouth. Failing to convince herself this was truly happening, the girl stared at the Fiend Cultivator who was chasing Luo Jianqing around.Frolicking for about fifteen minutes, Luo Jianiqng stopped dodging and grasped the tip of Mo Qiu\u2019s whip, \u201cI have to go back.\u201dMo Qiu sneered, \u201cSo, this is my friend-of-life-and-death, huh? You don\u2019t even care how I am or where I am!\u201dLuo Jianqing coughed awkwardly.The air suddenly froze again, until the elegant monk sighed and broke the silence. He stepped up and said, \u201cSince Cultivator Mo wants to chew the rag with Cultivator Luo, how about you guys follow me to my sect? Gui Yuan Sect is not far away from here. In two weeks, there will be a Grand Zen Debate held at my sect. If you guys are interested, I can lead the way.\u201dYun Xiang nodded immediately and asked, \u201cI\u2019m coming with you! However, I have one question: what is a Zen Debate?\u201dLuo Jianqing frowned in hesitation, \u201cI want to go back to Tai Hua Mountain as soon as\u2026\u201d, he paused because he felt the bleakness in Mo Qiu\u2019s gaze which forced him to change the words at the tip of his tongue. Luo Jianqing sighed, \u201cThen, Fo Zi, please lead the way.\u201dFo Zi nodded with a gentle smile.From his Interspatial Ring, Fo Zi took out a Buddha Bead which, surprisingly, wasn\u2019t made by sandalwood. Instead, the creator chose jade as its material which endowed the bead splendid glow when lit by the sunlight. Fo Zi murmured the mantra and as he did so, the bead enlarged into a giant sphere as big as a house.Fo Zi turned to his newly made friends, \u201cGui Yuan Sect is thousands of miles away. Riding my Jade Like Bead could save all of us some energy. What do you think?\u201dThey got on the bead at once.Though it was a bead made by jade, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t feel slippery on it as expected but felt quite refreshing. When they managed to keep their feet, a wisp of golden light shimmered in Fo Zi\u2019s amber eyes. In just a blink, the Buddha Bead raised hundreds of meters up to the sky and dashed towards their destination.The bead was flying steadily. At a low altitude like this, Luo Jianqing was even able to enjoy the impressive view.Not long after, the peaceful silence was broken by Yun Xiang who asked, \u201cMonk, you haven\u2019t told us what indeed is that so-called Grand Zen Debate.\u201dNot irritated by Yun Xiang\u2019s disrespectful address, Fo Zi smiled and explained to her patiently, \u201cThe Buddhism consists of Eight Sects which are San Lun Sect, Fa Xiang Sect, Tian Tai Sect, Hua Yan Sect, Zen Sect, Jing Tu Sect, Lv Sect and Zhen Yan Sect. I\u2019m from Gui Yuan Sect which belongs to the category of Zen Sect which comprises most of the Buddhism Cultivators. Every five years, Gui Yuan Sect would hold a Grand Zen Debate in which all the Buddhism Cultivators will attend. The eight sects would all send their representatives to debate on their interpretations of Buddhism.\u201dYun Xiang asked, \u201cWill every single Buddhism Cultivator participate in the debate?\u201dFo Zi shook his head, \u201cIf so, then the Zen Debate won\u2019t end for hundreds of years. You can never preach the Buddhism if what you say doesn\u2019t hold water. For the Grand Zen Debate, each one of the eight sect will send one cultivator to represent the whole sect to attend the debate, the one who hold his ground at last will be the winner and will bring honor and pride which can last five years to his sect.\u201dYun Xiang nodded slightly, \u201cWait, does it mean that there will be a different winner for each five years so that different Buddhism Sects could be happy?\u201dBefore Fo Zi could answer her question, Mo Qiu couldn\u2019t withstand Yun Xiang\u2019s ignorance, so he said, \u201cHow come you have literally no idea what\u2019s going on with the cultivation world? Oh wow, I know, it must be that you\u2019ve spent all of your time in cultivating. I\u2019m so impressed. Our Fiend Palace is located right next to Cen State. Even I know the winner of Zen Debate has been the Zen Sect for twenty consecutive years. How come you don\u2019t even know what the Eight Sects are?\u201dYun Xiang mumbled in chagrin, \u201cSurely I\u2019m not as knowledgeable as you are\u2026\u201dMo Qiu squinted at her. The latter went back to silence at once.Smiling, Luo Jianqing tried to make Yun Xiang feel less awkward, \u201cPlease don\u2019t blame Cultivator Yun. After all, she is not a Buddhism Cultivator. Twenty years ago, Fo Zi started to attend the debate representing the Zen Sect and won every debate. He never loses. Otherwise, why people address him as \u2018Fo Zi\u2019?\u201dEyes suddenly glittering, Yun Xiang peeped at Fo Zi and murmured, \u201cI have no idea that you are this brilliant\u2026\u201dThe Bead was flying in a lightning speed. Fo Zi was explaining Buddhism-related stuffs to them and got a very concentrated little audience \u2013 Yun Xiang, and little by little, Luo Jianqing\u2019s curiosity was triggered as well, so he sat closer to Fo Zi and focused on the interpretation.Mo Qiu was the only one who was still standing at the front and fiddling with his scourge, as if he had no interest in Fo Zi\u2019s fun adventures and experiences.Like this, the four of them left Yun State and arrived at Cen State.The further they left the border behind, the more streams they saw. Cen State was famous of its rippling water and magnificent mountain range. The streams of Cen State were well-known among the whole Xuan Tian Continent. A lot of cultivators who cultivated in water-related maneuvers came to Cen State for indoor training, because there are abundant lakes, rivers, and even the ocean \u2013 given that it was located at the edge of the Xuan Tian Continent.Fo Zi smiled, \u201cTen Years ago on the Grand Zen Debate, I had debated with a cultivator from Zhen Yan Sect who asked me a question: \u2018people were saying that Zen Sect\u2019s Fo Zi owns great wisdom, then, can you tell me, all things return to the one \u2014 to where does the one return?\u2019\u201dYun Xiang was completely confused, but she tried her best pondering the question, while Luo Jianqing was stunned.Glancing over at Lou Jianqing with a complicated gaze, Fo Zi explained, \u201cI replied him that all things are one from the beginning. Without one there is none, and without all things there is empty. All phenomena are nothing but mind. From the mind it thrives, and from the mind it dissipates. Since all things are one in the first place, there\u2019s no need to wonder where it would return.\u201dDrowning into the otherworldly zone, Luo Jianqing closed his eyes. Mo Qiu glanced over Fo Zi with a less aggressive gaze. Nonetheless, as the only one who still didn\u2019t figure it out, Yun Xiang frowned and asked, \u201cWhat are you talking about? I still don\u2019t understand.\u201dMouth twitched, Mo Qiu was about to reprimand her but at the same moment\u2026Boom!Aiming at the sky, a stream of fierce coercion rose from below. As if it was condensing the air into solid, the power was diabolic and constrained the four cultivator who were standing on the Buddha Bead. Luo Jianqing looked at Mo Qiu at once while the latter was doing the same.They exchanged a glance from which they understood what the other one was thinking.At time like this, Mo Qiu was the first one who popped into Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind. Having experienced several life-threatening dangers with Mo Qiu together, Luo Jianqing trusted Mo Qiu. In this life, the one he trusted the most was Xuan Lingzi, and then he himself; Mo Qiu was ranked at the third on Luo Jianqing\u2019s little \u201ctrustworthy\u201d list. Besides, the Fiend Cultivator dressed in scarlet was indeed the one who had the highest cultivation base among them.Enduring the ocean-like coercion, Mo Qiu and Luo Jianqing tried their best to find their ways towards each other. Figuring out what they were facing, Fo Zi became tensed up. Putting aside the etiquette, he held Yun Xiang\u2019s hand in case she was in any danger.However, the coercion didn\u2019t give them any chance to be prepared.Within a breath\u2026 Boom!This time, along with tremendous Spiritual Power, the coercion attacked them like a ferocious whirlwind.Luo Jianiqng reacted to it quickly. He grabbed Mo Qiu by the left hand and saved Yun Xiang who was standing close, but Fo Zi who was out of his reach fell off from the jade bead.Jolted, Luo Jianqing shouted, \u201cFo Zi!\u201dBefore he could do anything, Yun Xiang released her hand and took a leap \u2013 she made it, Fo Zi\u2019s hand was then gripped tightly by the girl. Pupils shrinking immediately, Luo Jianqing jumped off the bead as well and grasped Yun Xiang\u2019s hand. Mo Qiu didn\u2019t let go his friend-of-life-and-death, so the four young cultivators fell off from the Buddha Bead all together.Mo Qiu took out a delicate dagger from his Interspatial Ring. The weapon was decorated with magnificent colorful beads. The dazzling appearance concealed its perilous nature.Wrist moving slightly, Mo Qiu easily pierced through Fo Zi\u2019s Jade Like Bead using his dagger, trying to prevent everyone from falling down.Though they still slid down along the surface for quite a distance, Mo Qiu finally managed to put the motion to a stop. They were hanging on the bead like a streamer. Mo Qiu was the one who was holding the dagger, and then came Luo Jianqing, Yun Xiang, and Fo Zi.Surrounded by the intimidating coercion, even Mo Qiu who already achieved late-stage Nascent Soul Period could not operate his Spiritual Power, and his physical strength was pushed to a limit. Usually, three people, no, even thousands of people wouldn\u2019t be an issue, but now, the hand which was gripping the dagger was already shivering. Blue vines stood out on his hand, Mo Qiu\u2019s strength was clearly draining out.Seeing this, Luo Jianqing was so worried, \u201cMo Qiu, you cannot operate your Spiritual Power as well?\u201dMo Qiu gritted his teeth, \u201cThis coercion was generated by a cultivator who at least achieved Body Fusion Period. Who the hell is this Fiend Cultivator who dares to mess around on Gui Yuan Sect\u2019s state!?\u201dAt time like this, even talking was a waste of strength.They stayed quiet since then. Mo Qiu put all his efforts on gripping the dagger. Holding Luo Jianqing on his other hand, he had no spare hand to help climbing up to the top of the sphere. Yun Xiang and Luo Jianqing were thwarted by the same reason \u2013 both of their hands were occupied.Just like this, they put through for half an hour, but the coercion was still hovering around.Blood was seeping from Mo Qiu\u2019s arm. Thousands of small blood beads oozed out of his pore, making him looked so miserable. A coercion like this not only restrained their Spiritual Power but was also attacking them restlessly.For now, Mo Qiu and Yun Xiang were the ones who were suffering the most. The former needed to hold four people\u2019s weight on his right hand, while the latter had the weakest cultivation base.Nonetheless, Fo Zi was enduring the unbearable torture on his heart.He watched Yun Xiang dragging him exhaustedly with only one hand but could do nothing to help her ease the pain.Mo Qiu\u2019s arm was covered by blood already, and Yun Xiang\u2019s mouth was oozing blood. Nevertheless, no one dared to let go, because each one of them knew that, down there, a cultivator with extremely high-level cultivation base was out of control. If they got down right now, nobody knew what the heck would happen. The best option was to take actions after they figured out what indeed was going on. Getting to the ground right now was no different with committing suicide.If they let go, they were not a hundred percent sure that they could survive from the coercion. Besides, there was a very high risk of exposing themselves to that powerful cultivator.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(III)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThey went on for a tug-of-war with the coercion, but the jade bead could hold no longer.Watching the three cultivators who were holding him with all their efforts, Fo Zi looked profound, his eyes rippling as if it contained all the dharma of the world. He sighed lightly, and smiled, \u201cAmitabha, if we couldn\u2019t figure out a way, Cultivator Yun would run out of her strength. There\u2019s a saying in Buddhism that \u2018nothing ventured, nothing gained\u2019. I think it would be a good idea if I go down first and check the situation for you guys.\u201dLuo Jianqing was shocked. At the moment he looked down and saw Fo Zi let go ofYun Xiang\u2019s hand.Eyes opening widely, Luo Jianqing wasn\u2019t astute enough to take any action, because, before he did, a comely hand grabbed Fo Zi at once.Not expecting this to happen, Fo Zi lifted his gaze and saw Yun Xiang belching a mouthful of blood which dyed Fo Zi\u2019s elegant face in blood. Body shivering acutely, Yun Xiang gripped Fo Zi\u2019s hand tightly and said, \u201cBefore I kill you for revenge, you are NOT allowed\u2026 to die!\u201dWith blood covering his face, Fo Zi gazed at the girl dressed in black with astonishment. After a long silence, he smiled with nobody knowing the reason, \u201cLady, you are possessed again. A narrow escape was a \u2018narrow\u2019 one, true, but I was just falling down, it was a \u2018escape\u2019 as well.\u201dYun Xiang had enough, \u201cShut up!\u201d\u201cAmitabha, as you wish.\u201d Fo Zi answered.Seeing this scene, Luo Jianqing finally relieved. To be honest, he was in a great pain as well. Mo Qiu needed to hold the weight of all three of them, while he needed to support two as well. Besides, his Cultivation Base was lower than Mo Qiu\u2019s.However, when Luo Jianqing raised his head, what he saw was Mo Qiu\u2019s out of shape scarlet robe which was wet by his own blood.The operator of this coercion was probably just a Body-Fusion Period Cultivator, but his coercion was mixed with colossal Sense of Kill. It was nothing like the coercion that Xuan Lingzi released to reprimand Luo Jianqing, nor it was the coercion that Hao Xingzi used to test Mo Qiu. Their coercions were determined to test the younger cultivator\u2019s willpower, but not like what they were facing today \u2013 the operator of the coercion had the intension to kill every living creature within his reach.Seeing his friend suffering, Luo Jianqing almost sobbed, but he could do nothing about it.Suddenly, Mo Qiu shouted out a curse towards the ground, \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you one day!\u201dThen, a scarlet glow gleamed from Mo Qiu\u2019s body. Wisps of dark Fiend Qi hovered around him. The Fiend Qi was slightly different from what Luo Jianqing saw previously. It was not pure black but mixed with something in bloody color. The presence of Fiend Qi restrained the coercion in a complete manner. Feet tapping the air, Mo Qiu got back to the jade bead.Then he dragged Luo Jianqing, Yun Xiang, and Fo Zi out of the danger.As soon as stepping on the bead, Yun Xiang passed out. Luo Jianqing took out a pill and helped her take it.Fo Zi was no better than Mo Qiu. As the one who was the closest to the center of the coercion, now his face was pallid.Making sure Yun Xiang would be all right, Luo Jianqing turned around and saw Mo Qiu spitting out a mouthful of blood and reeling back. Luo Jianqing rushed to him and caught him before he reached to the surface, and at this moment, the ferocious coercion was finally dissipated as well as the dark-red Fiend Qi.Eyes shut tight, mouth oozing blood, Mo Qiu collapsed, leaning on Luo Jianqing\u2019s chest.Immediately, Luo Jianqing operated his Spiritual Power to probe inside Mo Qiu\u2019s vines. The next moment, when he realized what he sensed, he was shocked, \u201cHow is this possible?!\u201dWithin a blink, Mo Qiu\u2019s Cultivation Base descended from nearly Out of Body Period to late-stage Nascent Soul Period.Luo Jianqing never heard anything like this \u2013 one\u2019s Cultivation Base shrunk dramatically in a sudden. Mo Qiu\u2019s wounds weren\u2019t that bad, but his Cultivation Base was indeed weakened. Without any reason, Luo Jianqing recalled the black Fiend Qi with a touch of blood hidden beneath. An idea glittered inside his mind, but he failed to catch it.Since the coercion vanished completely, the four of them could finally take a break on the top of the jade bead.Mo Qiu woke up after fainting out for a while. Except the reduced Cultivation Base, he looked pretty normal.However, this time, Mo Qiu\u2019s eyes met with Fo Qi\u2019s in the air. Mo Qiu had sensed the grimness. Even Fo Zi lost his usual smile.Fo Qi said, \u201cThe sins are\u2026 tremendous.\u201dNonetheless, Mo Qiu said in calmness, \u201cHe at least killed\u2026 a hundred thousand people.\u201dFo Zi operated the jade bead and lowered the altitude near the ground. When they reached the desired height, Luo Jianqing saw a river in crimson color. The river originated from far beyond the mountain alley. It was simply a river with nothing else. The odd thing was that \u2013 it was\u2026 a blood river.The smell of blood tensed Luo Jianqing\u2019s expression.When they made closer to the origin of the river, some scattered corpse and chunks of meat started to appear. Luo Jianqing turned expressionless, while Yun Xiang\u2019s face was pallid. Fo Zi seemed to be not influenced at all, but the clenching fingers on his Buddha Beads Bracelet revealed his anger.Mo Qiu was the only one who was watching all of these in complete calmness.When the four cultivators reached to a common village and saw a pile of corpses, Yun Xiang had enough of these and vomited. As she was spitting out and wiping tears, she said, \u201cA diabolic Fiend Cultivator like this one really exists in this world?\u201dWith a wisp of coldness hidden beneath his gaze, Mo Qiu questioned her, \u201cSuch a hypocrite, aren\u2019t you? As a Fiend Cultivator, why are you still saying these?\u201dYun Xiang defended herself, \u201cBut I never killed anyone!\u201dThe words dropped in Luo Jianqing and Fo Zi\u2019s ears and made the two young cultivators astonished. The Fiend Cultivatress went on, \u201cMy Master told me that once a Fiend Cultivator breaks the line and makes a kill, there\u2019s no way for he or she to turn back. Therefore, for me, killing has been forbidden since I was little, not to mention snatching other\u2019s Spiritual Power. Otherwise, why \u2013 on your point of view \u2013 I am still a Gold Core Period Cultivator, given that I\u2019ve cultivated for thirty-nine years?\u201dHearing Yun Xiang\u2019s explanation, Fo Zi wasn\u2019t moved at all but said the truth in a bleak tone, \u201cBut your majestic Master \u2013 the Fiend Exalt \u2013 has killed 3.61 million innocent people.\u201dRage was ignited in Yun Xiang\u2019s eyes, \u201cDon\u2019t you dare speak of my Master like that!\u201dFo Zi threw off all of his gentleness and blankness. With the diabolic pile of corpses reflected in his limpid eyes, the monk said in an extreme calmness, \u201cSince what I told you is the truth, there is no point refuting me. The Fiend Exalt achieves what he gets today by stepping on a road which is composed by millions of corpses. Then what do you think made my sect move to Cen State a thousand years ago? To stop the merciless man, obviously.\u201dHand formed into a claw, Yun Xiang took a strike, \u201cStop speaking of my Master like that!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

(VI)Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayFo Zi didn\u2019t dodge Yun Xiang\u2019s attack. She pulled back immediately, yet still ripped a piece of bloody flesh from Fo Zi\u2019s chest.Fo Zi was still wearing a cold face, with one hand clutching the bead while the other pointing at the massive pyramid of death. He yelled, \u201cThis is what most Fiend Cultivators would do! And we only saw one of the villages. You know what? There is no one alive within 30 miles of this place! You cannot see it, but I can! Fiend Cultivation has made monstrous crime that even God couldn\u2019t forgive! Yun Xiang, you\u2019ve never killed anyone because your master has set such a good example for you, but that doesn\u2019t apply to all the Fiend Cultivators. Among all of you, Fiend Exalt Mo Qianqiu is the most hideous devil.\u201dYun Xiang\u2019s eyes sparkled with unshed tears, but she didn\u2019t attack Fo Zi anymore. She just kept saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know Fiend Cultivators would act like that. But\u2026 I can\u2019t allow you to disrespect my master.\u201dFo Zi said, \u201cAmitabha, you become obsessive again.\u201dYun Xiang raised her head abruptly and said seriously, \u201cBut you have no idea what my master has done to make up the crime he has committed. Do you know why demons haven\u2019t invaded the thirty-six states for centuries? Do you know what we\u2019ve sacrificed since our Fiend Palace erects on the border between men and demons? My master reached the late stage of Da Sheng Period over a thousand years ago, even if he only gets a handful of good years left, he is still\u2026\u201d\u201cEnough!\u201d Mo Qiu interrupted Yun Xiang coldly while this girl in black looked at him in astonishment.Mo Qiu stepped forward and looked at Fo Zi, \u201cYes, the Fiend Exalt is a bastard, but Fo Zi Yu Chen, you shouldn\u2019t stubbornly argue who is right with Yun Xiang, as everyone knows that you are always right while she is wrong. You can kill the Fiend Exalt if you hate him so much. But if you can\u2019t, then don\u2019t argue about the nonsense here. Don\u2019t you want to kill that Fiend Exalt who has killed hundreds of thousands of people?Hearing their argument, Luo Jianqing was somehow a little bit depressed.He recalled what Mo Qiu had told him long ago. At that time, they were still in Liu Yan Valley. Mo Qiu told him that less than ten Fiend Cultivators had never killed any people. One percent of Fiend Cultivators only killed people who deserved nothing but death. As for other Fiend Cultivators, they all killed at random.But after all, \u201cthe weak will stand as an easy prey to the strong\u201d was the law of nature.Since this was the law of nature, everyone would abide by it.The Fiend Exalt could kill and be killed. But no one could kill him now, so he could continue to kill others.Then he was undefeatable?Of course not.Luo Jianqing knew what Yun Xiang wanted to say. It was said that the Fiend Exalt had reached the late stage of Da Sheng Period over one thousand years ago, but up to now, he was still in that stage as the law of nature restrained his development. Although he hadn\u2019t killed the innocent for thousands of years, he still had to make up for his crime.Now, maybe he was really about to die.Any cultivator could only stay in Da Sheng Period for three thousand years, or he would die\u2026 Many he had stayed in this period long enough.With low-grade Spiritual Bone, the Fiend Exalt joined the Fiend Cultivation to become the supreme one. He had killed millions of innocent people, that was his Cause. He permanently lost the chance to finish the Da Sheng Period and had to guard the border for men for his life, that was the Consequence he should bear.Besides, Xuan Lingzi once told Luo Jianqing, \u201cThe Fiend Exalt has to spend a life to make up for each person he killed. After he dies, he can only enter the next round of life as an animal until he has made atonement for all of them one by one. The number of the rounds depends on how many people he has killed.\u201dAt that time, Luo Jianqing had asked how to make atonement for them.Xuan Lingzi pointed at a village three miles away from Tai Hua Mountain, where a famer was working in the fields. He said, \u201cIf the Fiend Exalt enters the next life as this cattle, and the one killed him will reincarnate as the farmer, then the Fiend Exalt has to be whipped by this famer for its whole life; he has to plow day and night for the farmer; when he is old and unable to plow, he will be killed by this famer and sold. Jianqing, this is his karma.\u201d Suddenly, Luo Jianqing was enlightened.Nihility power squirted out below his navel, swallowing the spiritual power around.Mo Qiu and other two men had originally been planning how to find the Fiend Exalt. But now, Luo Jianqing was about to enter the next period, so Mo Qiu flicked his sleeves and set a ward to protect him, and Fo Zi set another one. They sat down with legs crossed and protected Luo Jianqing.Luo Jianqing knew nothing of these.That nihility power crossed mountains and oceans, passed the rivers in Cen State. It saw the massive pyramid of death described by Fo Zi and strands of Karma threads interspersing in nature!Boom!Continuous loud sounds rang in Luo Jianqing\u2019s mind.\u201cWhat\u2019s Cause and what\u2019s Consequence?\u201d\u201cWhen your Cause is accumulated to a certain amount, the Consequence will come!\u201d\u201cIf the nature is wrong, if the nature is injustice, then how can it judge, how can it bring the karma!\u201cNine Heavenly Seizure Record! The Fourth Seizure \u2013 Seize the Karma!\u201dLuo Jianqing was overwhelmed by the karmas he had seen in this world. This was the first time for him to see the karma threads so clearly. Each person in Cen state carried with countless threads.If you handed out someone a plate of porridge, then he owed you a favor. If someday you became poor and hungry, he would also hand out a steamed bread to you.If you ignored someone\u2019s cry for help, then you owed him a favor. If someday you were sentenced to death, he would be the one who executed you.A beautiful lady encouraged a young man with a smile, then she was married to him who was talented and hardworking.An old couple accompanied each other for the whole life due to their promise in childhood.Luo Jianqing enjoyed all these marvelous karmas until he saw the massive pyramid of death, and then a noise came to his mind. Just as he was about to take back the spiritual awareness, he suddenly saw a thin, short old man in black.Luo Jianqing opened his eyes, \u201cI saw it!\u201dMo Qiu stood up immediately and asked, \u201cSaw that?\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s eyes went gloomy and he replied coldly, \u201cI saw the Fiend Exalt that had killed one hundred thousand people.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 96": "Chapter 96 - Consider the Presence of This Sword as Myself, Bring Back Your GreatPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayAmong the meandering mountain range, four figures dashed through the forest at lightning speed.They didn\u2019t choose flying to get to their destination for it was possible to expose them to their unknown enemy. At the meantime, Fo Zi took out an alms bowl and enchanted it so it could hover in the air above them, then he explained, \u201cthis is a Thunder Alms Bowl of Protection which could conceal our trace from being discovered by anyone who is under Tribulation Passage Period.\u201dUnder a situation like this, the four moved as a group, following the lead of Luo Jianqing and Fo Zi.The Fiend Cultivator had just killed a hundred thousand people, so, apparently, he had generated immense amount of Lines of Karma. Not long ago, Luo Jianqing had reached the Fourth Seizure of Nine Heavenly Seizure Record \u2013 Seizing Karma, so he could see it in a blur. On the other hand, Fo Zi was pretty sensitive to the Flame of Sins, and that was the reason why he saw a cascade of bloody glow in the middle of the forest.Among the massacred a hundred thousand people, most of them were simply commoners; the cultivator with the highest cultivation base had only reached Qi Condensation Period.Facing a powerful cultivator who had reached Body Fusion Period, they could do nothing but gave in their lives like fragile weeds. At that time, a man might have been chatting with his wife, but the next moment he was embraced by the arms of death; perhaps a student was about to attend the life-changing exam in the capital city, but was killed silently in the middle of nowhere.There were countless small countries in the thirty-six states, but the boundary between the mortal world and the cultivation world was respected by both sides, so that neither the cultivators nor the commoners would break it.However, neither Fiend Cultivators nor the Demon Clan took this rule seriously.Mo Qiu stayed quite calm and explained, \u201cIt was super easy for a Fiend Cultivator to kill a mortal. Although they cannot get Spiritual Power from the body of a commoner, there are plenty of Vitality left in the corpse, which, to be honest, is even more useful than the Spiritual Power. For instance, a man who is supposed to die at sixty years old is killed by a Fiend Cultivator at his thirty, then the remaining thirty-years of his Vitality would be snatched by that Fiend Cultivator; as for the poor man, he would turn into a ghost and would have to stay in that form for thirty years to enter the samsara.\u201dAlong their way, Fo Zi was continuously chanting Heart Sutra in order to release souls from purgatory.When Fo Zi chanted, the sutra turned into visible words and, with a shining golden glow, flooded out of his mouth. The Tangible Sutra! This was Fo Zi\u2019s deep perception of the Buddhism Sutra. He kept deliver the innocent souls into the samsara, saving them from being tortured after turning to a ghost and roaming around lonely in this cold world.Fo Zi was right. The reason why Gui Yuan Sect moved to Cen State a thousand years ago was to restrain the Fiend Exalt.Cen State had tremendous amount of water but not mountain. The Gui Yuan Sect abandoned its Spiritual Mountain and migrated here because Cen State was right next to the land of Fiend Palace. Even though the Fiend Exalt remained quiet for a thousand years, the number of Fiend Cultivators who followed their nature of killing was way more than that of Fiend Cultivators who kept their hands untainted by the grime of blood. The Buddhism Cultivators took it as their responsibility to stop the Fiend Cultivators from killing.Gazing at another village undergone massacre, Fo Zi couldn\u2019t hold back the sorrow anymore, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for this. I didn\u2019t have the power to save you.\u201dNevertheless, Mo Qiu still scoffed, \u201cEven Xuan Lingzi \u2013 the top of the so-called righteous cultivator \u2013 can\u2019t save all the innocent souls from Fiend Cultivators all over the world. The Fiend Palace reigns seventy to eighty percent Fiend Cultivators, tries hard to restrain them, but still can\u2019t prevent some Fiend Cultivators from bringing bloodbath to the innocent. The Heavenly Will has its own rules. You\u2019d better ask the Will for the answer you seek.\u201dFo Zi didn\u2019t respond.Watching the confrontation, Luo Jianqing could do nothing but sigh silently.They kept marching forward. When they reached a hill, Mo Qiu suddenly stopped. Luo Jianqing turned his head to face him. Frowning, he said, \u201cWe will be noticed if we keep going, won\u2019t we? He is deep in a cave located at the middle of that mountain.\u201dMo Qiu nodded lightly, \u201cYes. No matter how sordid he is, he is a Body Fusion Period cultivator. No matter how powerful this Thunder Alms Bowl of Protection is, it won\u2019t be able to eliminate all of our trace of sense at this distance. You can store it in your Interspatial Ring right now. It won\u2019t make any difference with or without the alms bowl. The Fiend Cultivator is refining the Vitality of those commoners.\u201dFo Zi summoned the Thunder Alms Bowl of Protection back immediately.Luo Jianqing unsheathed the Floating Frost Sword, looking at Mo Qiu in a bleak gaze while the latter was doing the same.Luo Jianqing said, \u201cIt should be a late-stage Body Fusion Period cultivator.\u201dMo Qiu nodded, \u201cThat\u2019s true, but seems like he reaches that period not long before.\u201dYun Xiang asked, \u201cIt\u2019s rare for a Fiend Cultivator to achieve late-stage Body Fusion Period. Mo Qiu, have you recognized who he is?\u201dMo Qiu shook his head, \u201cHe might be a Rogue Cultivator who didn\u2019t join the Fiend Palace.\u201dAlthough the Fiend Palace ruled most of the Fiend Cultivators in the world, it posted lots of rules for Fiend Cultivators to follow as well. Therefore, many powerful Fiend Cultivators refused to join the Fiend Palace, but they didn\u2019t dare to openly oppose the Fiend Palace.No one spoke anymore. They kept quiet.After all, they were going to face a Body Fusion Period Cultivator, and his identity as a Fiend Cultivator bestowed on him the ability way more powerful than the other cultivators at the same level. Among the four young cultivators, Mo Qiu owned the highest cultivation base which was late-stage Nascent Soul Period, while Yun Xiang had the lowest cultivation base \u2013 late-stage Gold Core Period. Even though they were indeed the most legendary young cultivators in their generation, they were still weaker than the Fiend Cultivator for two major periods.Musing for quite some time, Luo Jianqing finally came out a plan, \u201cIf we want to kill him, we must do it while he is feeble. I know that when a Fiend Cultivator is absorbing others\u2019 Spiritual Power and forging it as his or her own, the cultivator will be prone to vital danger. We only have a short window of time. Probably only fifteen minutes. Moreover, even if the Fiend Cultivator is quite weak at that moment, he is still a Body Fusion Period cultivator. Thus, we must use our Final Maneuver, without holding force back.\u201dHearing that Luo Jianqing had pointed out the weakness of Fiend Cultivator, Mo Qiu and Yun Xiang exchanged an astonishing look.It was an unwritten rule that the weakness of Fiend Cultivator should never be shared with someone who was not one of them. How come Luo Jianqing got to know this?They didn\u2019t have much time to ponder anymore. After a while of contemplation, Mo Qiu made a decision, \u201cI agree with you. We should all use our Final Maneuver to grasp the chance \u2013 if there is any \u2013 of killing that devil. However, we still need a plan of retreating in case that Fiend Cultivator survives from our attack. I have two Flying Shadow Butterfly, and each one could take one of us away from the battlefield in an instant. Yun Xiang, you take one. The other one is for you, Luo Jianqing.\u201dSeeing a red paper-made butterfly handed to him, Luo Jianqing was transfixed. He raised his head blankly and said, \u201cYou should keep this one since you only have two. I\u2019m good.\u201dMo Qiu lifted an eyebrow, \u201cSo you think I\u2019ll be trapped? Don\u2019t worry. Do you still remember that you once gave me a Jade Tablet which can help the owner fleeing thousands of miles away? It\u2019s mine since you have given it to me. I won\u2019t give it back even if you beg me for it. I\u2019ll use that for retreating.\u201dThus, Luo Jianqing stopped refusing Mo Qiu and took the Flying Shadow Butterfly.Fo Zi was left aside watching them. The elegant monk smiled, \u201cAmitabha, I also have a magic item which can help me escape.\u201dMo Qiu sneered slightly, \u201cI won\u2019t give you anything anyway.\u201dFo Zi was still fondling his Bddha Beads silently without uttering a word.This was what they called \u2018the difference between the rich and the poor\u2019. If they were four common Rouge Cultivators, they wouldn\u2019t even dare getting close to a Body Fusion Period cultivator, not to mention killing him. However, as four genius of the big sects who were bestowed on the most abundant cultivating resources by their sects, they had even got their magic items for fleeing.It was getting dark; evening came very soon.They were staying in a cave and waiting quietly with great patience.That Fiend Cultivator had killed a hundred thousand people. It took time for him to absorb their Vitality. The weakest moment of a Fiend Cultivator would be the time of sunrise. Not for the same reason with the Ghost Cultivators who were born slightly dreading of the Sun, the Fiend Cultivators\u2019 mental power would be weakened when the first beam of sunshine tore apart the night because it was the moment they were most prone to their Internal Demons, being tortured by their conscience.A wait like this lasted for three days.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The bice figure flitted toward the destination, followed by Mo Qiu, Fo Zi and Yun Xiang.Four beams of light landed at the cave in which the satanic Fiend Cultivator was hiding. Their enemy was covered by wisps of scarlet light like a cocoon. There wasn\u2019t time left for them to hesitate, so Luo Jianqing drew out the Floating Frost Sword and operated a hand seal, and with his feet tapping the ground, tremendous amount of Spiritual Power dispersed immediately.\u201cBlossom Lotus Sword!\u201dAt such a critical moment, Luo Jianqing was already lucky enough to operate his Final Maneuver without any slip. Since he had no one hundred percent confidence to use Seizing Karma which he just learnt, he didn\u2019t add on the power of the fourth seizure on the Floating Frost Sword.Seizing the Plants and Seasons! Seizing Lives! Seizing Right and Wrong!Three streams of invisible power hovered around the sword like blossoming petals of bice lotus. The colossal amount of Spiritual Power shrouded the firmament as if the earth was first separated from heaven. Intimidating Sword Qi dispersed from the blade.\u201cFiend Blood Figure Scourge!\u201dMo Qiu was manipulating his Blood Shadowing Scourge which operated thousands of shadows of blood and all pounced fiercely toward the Fiend Cultivator. The strips of blood shadows were transformed in to countless blood snakes, restlessly twitching their bright red tongues while taking the strike.Fo Zi broke the Buddha Bead Bracelet which he wore all day long, so that the glossy beads were floating in front of him. Eighteen in total, the beads glittered golden light splendidly. when looking at them, one felt refreshing in deed and could tell by taking a glance that the beads contained magnificent power.Finger tips gently touching the bead, one by one, Fo Zi dyed every bead with a drop of his Spiritual Blood. Then with palms pushing forward like invincible roaring waves, Fo Zi made all of the beads dash towards the Fiend Cultivator!\u201cParinirvana can only be achieved when the eighteen-levels of hell are empty!\u201dThe casted three maneuvers were their most powerful ones that were determined to take deadly aim, and these were what they got so far. As three cultivators who had passed the line of forming a Nascent Soul, they didn\u2019t have the intention to ask Yun Xiang to join the fight. However, Yun Xiang suddenly voluntarily belched out a mouthful of blood!That blood contained Black Fiend Qi \u2013 it was the blood from the tip of her heart!Frightened, Mo Qiu looked at Yun Xiang and shouted in a harsh tone, \u201cStop!\u201dNonetheless, it was too late. Yun Xiang\u2019s blood was spat out already and then formed a ferocious Claw Shadow.The Fiend Cultivator was attacked by four maneuvers at the same time. It happened with an instant which in turn gave him little time to react. The Fiend Cultivator beckoned his Spiritual Power to defense himself but before he could even open his eyes, the strikes casted by four young legendary cultivators whacked him with no holding back.Boom!The cave was mutilated by the extreme quake. Luo Jianqing and his companies managed to flew out before it collapsed completely. Yun Xiang fainted by the moment they got out of the cave. She fell straight downward like a kite without a string. Luckily, Fo Zi, who was flying close to her, caught her before she hit the ground.Catching them up, Mo Qiu looked at the girl who stayed unconscious with a pallid face, then said in rage, \u201cYou know so damn well that you are different from other Fiend Cultivators! For you, cultivating wasn\u2019t that easy! If you attack directly with the power of your soul, you are prone for fatal injure which might prevent you from breaking Nascent Soul Period for the rest of your life! Do you know who serious this is?! You might not have much time left if this turns out to be reality!\u201dStill in a coma, obviously, Yun Xiang couldn\u2019t hear what Mo Qiu yelled at her.Besides, Mo Qiu knew that now wasn\u2019t the perfect time to rebuke her.Luo Jianqing beckoned Qing Jun out of the Interspatial Ring. Still maintaining the child body, Qing Jun actually had already recovered twenty percent of his strength. Seeing the four in a tight corner, Qing Jun immediately frowned, but before he could ask any question, Luo Jianqing interrupted him, \u201cQing Jun, please take this girl to a safe place. We can\u2019t take care of her right now.\u201dWithout asking anything, Qing Jun brought Yun Xiang with him and flew away. They soon disappeared at the edge of the sky.Luo Jianqing, Mo Qiu and Fo Zi were all floating in the sky, eyebrows knitted, watching the hill which was destroyed into piles of scattered stones. There was little movement in the ruins, as if the Fiend Cultivator was truly dead, but none of them dared to lower their guards.The sunlit stones were reflecting shining gloss.Luo Jianiqng stared at what remained of the hill for almost one hour but failed to sense anything. Gradually, he let down his guard. After all, the Fiend Cultivator\u2019s existence could not be detected anymore; there was a possibility that they did kill him when he was at the weakest moment.Finally, Fo Zi relieved, \u201cAmitabha, what we did is indeed a benefaction. Today, we take revenge for the slaughtered a hundred thousand commoners. Ghosts, we\u2019ve killed your life-taker, now, who were still lingering around here could enter the samsara and let go of your enmity.\u201dAs he spoke, Fo Zi silently casted the golden mantra, delivering those who were still gripping the agony and wouldn\u2019t let out into the samsara.However, though shrouded by the mantra, the ghosts were still showing no signs of leaving. Fo Zi immediately widened his eyes while Mo Qiu and Luo Jianqing did the same. They exclaimed at the same time. \u201cSomething\u2019s wrong!\u201dThe next moment, they heard a thundering blare!The whole world was shivering. The six mountains which surrounded them collapsed asunder. Countless stone pieces covered the sky. The three young cultivators were forced back by the rain of stones. When they finally managed to stand straight, a bloody pile of flesh in a figure of an old man appeared at the top of the ruins.At once, frightening coercion filled the mountain range.An ungainly elder barged out of the ruin, gloomily glaring at the vigorous young legendary cultivators standing in the air. The malodorous figure was covered with blood. From the gash on the belly, his intestines were all plucked out. He should have been dead right now, but the truth was the opposite.Luo Jianqing\u2019s Blossom Lotus Sword severed his stomach; Mo Qiu\u2019s Fiend Blood Figure Scourge flogged though his spinal cord; Fo Zi\u2019s Eighteen-level Hell of Beads broke his every single rib; Yun Xiang\u2019s Fiend Shadow Claw made by the blood of her heart tip left strips of wounds on his heart.However, their enemy was still breathing!\u201cHumble like ants, how dare you raid me like that!\u201dWith Spiritual Power, the voice echoed among the mountain range.Long time ago, Luo Jianqing nearly lost his life due to the fight with a Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon. Mo Qiu saved him from the hand of death and killed the beast. The Flood Dragon was badly injured and degraded to an eighth-level Demon Beast which equaled to a human cultivator at the early-stage Body Fusion Period when they were having a fight. However, right now, the Fiend Cultivator they were facing today was much different.Both Luo Jianqing and Mo Qiu knew so well about how powerful a Fiend Cultivator could be. Even if he was wounded like this, their enemy surely had a cultivation base higher than middle-stage Body Fusion Period, plus common Fiend Cultivator\u2019s excellent self-repairing ability, as long as he was still alive, most of the wounds wouldn\u2019t be a problem and would be mended within a short period of time.Luo Jianqing gripped the Floating Frost Sword, then looked at Mo Qiu and Fo Zi.Eyes meeting in the air, they exchanged glances. Without saying anything, they got what each other meant \u2013 so they dashed forward together, leaving no room for their enemy to recover.Brandishing his sword, Luo Jianqing was generating maneuvers that could all bring death upon the devil.Whipping his scourge, Mo Qiu was aiming at the vital organs of the Fiend Cultivator. Operating his beads, Fo Zi was attacking the shamble body. Their figures were as fast as lightning, constantly crossing the battlefield in a blur, showing the arrogant man the power of the legends!The Fiend Cultivator was wailing painfully. Finally, he had had enough. Pounding hard on his ribs which were already exposed in the air, he broke one of them and took it off from his body! The pale piece of skeleton turned into a giant bone knife, full of intimidating Spiritual Power of a Body Fusion Period Cultivator.A horrific shadow of blade attacked Fo Zi.The monk squinted and beckoned the Thunder Alms Bowl of Protection. The strike was misfired, but Fo Zi was knocked in the air.The second strike was aimed at Mo Qiu\u2019s shoulder. The cultivator in scarlet was almost hit. Though saving his shoulder from marring, Mo Qiu was still whacked to the ground by the impact.Seeing his friends being injured one by one, Luo Jianqing lost his usual calmness.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Suddenly, the cold sword shined and lotus patterns began to appear on it. Although blood was oozing out from his mouth, Luo Jianqing enchanted faster. Finally, before the Skeleton Sword hit him, Luo Jianqing raised the Floating Frost Sword and blocked the attack.\u201cBlossom Lotus Sword, seize the karma!\u201dA lotus with four petals blossomed gradually and abruptly dashed towards the Fiend Cultivator.This attack had exceeded the limit of Nascent Soul cultivator, so even a normal Out-of-Body cultivator might die of it. The Fiend Cultivator had been seriously wounded and dared not to confront this attack directly. He hurriedly raised his sword in hope of blocking it, but that lotus made a turn and hit right on his head.Boom! Boom! Boom!The Fiend Cultivator roared painfully.He didn\u2019t know what happened, as he could not see those lines of karma above his head. These threads were terribly dense and each one carried enormous hatred. Each blameless victim was eager to strip the Fiend Cultivator\u2019s alive and ate his flesh.\u201cGive my life back!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you! I\u2019m gonna kill you\u2026\u201d\u201cWhy did you kill me, why did you kill me? Give my life back!\u201dThe Fiend Cultivator felt that he heard a lot of voices, but these voices were not from the innocent victims. They had been dead for long and now they were just wandering ghosts without any consciousness, so they couldn\u2019t talk. These voices came from the victims\u2019 lingering hatred in those lines.A happy family suddenly got ridden to death, and their bright future disappeared in an instant.If their hatred could be materialized, the Fiend Cultivator might have already been smashed into thousand pieces!Now, as the \u201cBlossom Lotus Sword\u201d showed all the karmas, the hatred from these karmas was like a fire, burning the primordial life of the Fiend Cultivator.He kept crying desperately but unable to escape the hatred in the lines.Luo Jianqing suffered from the backfire of \u201cBlossom Lotus Sword\u201d. He felt a chest pain and blood kept running from his mouth. He wiped off a trickle of blood with his hand and cautiously gazed at the Fiend Cultivator who seemed to have gone mad.\u201cI killed you because you were weak!\u201d\u201cYou were weak so you ended up as my prey!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s your own fault that you don\u2019t cultivate to become immortal. I\u2019m immortal! I\u2019m immortal!\u201dThe Fiend Cultivator had been driven crazy and cried painfully. His eyes were bloodshot and he had been totally insane. He still held his Skeleton Sword tightly. When he happened to see Luo Jianqing, he shouted furiously, \u201cI\u2019m gonna kill you!!!\u201dThe next second, he raised the sword and rushed towards Luo Jianqing.Luo Jianqing raised his sword and was about to block the attack, but that Fiend Cultivator suddenly stopped at ten meters away from Luo Jianqing.A scarlet whip penetrated his head, from the back to the middle of his eyebrows. The Fiend Cultivator turned around slowly with eyes wide open and saw another Fiend Cultivator in red standing behind him. He couldn\u2019t believe what happened and said hoarsely, \u201cThis\u2026 this Fiend Whip\u2026 You\u2019re\u2026 Fiend\u2026 Fiend\u2026\u201dMo Qiu whipped again, and this time the whip penetrated the Fiend Cultivator\u2019s throat and finally killed him!Mo Qiu wiped the blood at the corner of his mouth and took the black-and-scarlet whip back into the Interspatial Ring. Luo Jianqing had seen this whip before. Mo Qiu used it to kill the Gold Sun Heaven Live Flood Dragon, yet he hadn\u2019t seen Mo Qiu take it out after that. This was the second time he used it.It was not an ordinary powerful instrument. Luo Jianqing somehow felt that it was at least a heaven-level instrument.Luo Jianqing knew that Mo Qiu possessed a lot of instruments, but as his friend, he wouldn\u2019t go to ask him anything about it if Mo Qiu didn\u2019t talk about it.He wouldn\u2019t ask him anything about this whip, nor about how he became the cadre of the Fiend Palace.After they killed the Body Fusion Fiend Cultivator, all three of them felt exhausted and fell to the bottom.They didn\u2019t care about how deep it was. They fell on the ground and punched a large crater. Lying in the crater, they looked at the sky.They sky was as blue and clear as it was tens of millions of years before. It wouldn\u2019t be changed by the fact that a Fiend Cultivator killed hundreds of thousands of people, or the fact that three brilliant men killed that brutal Fiend Cultivator.A mild breeze drifted the clouds away. Luo Jianqing suddenly laughed out, so did Mo Qiu. Even Fo Zi, who was always gentle, also followed suit.Luo Jianqing said, \u201cWithout you, I would have died today.\u201dMo Qiu said, \u201cI\u2019m glad you know that I have saved you many times.\u201dFo Zi said slowly, \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t help you a lot.\u201dLuo Jianqing shook his head, \u201cIt was your enchantment that trapped that Fiend Cultivator into his own karma.\u201dMo Qiu laughed, \u201cIt seems that you really have some strength.\u201dFo Zi beamed, \u201cWell, I have to admit it now.\u201dThey laughed out again.They just lay in that crater still for three days. When they restored their spiritual power, Fo Zi stood up first, then Mo Qiu also stood up reluctantly, while Luo Jianqing still lay down there.Mo Qiu\u2019s lips twitched. He walked to Luo Jianqing and was about to say something, but was shocked.He saw a handsome cultivator in blue looking up at the sky and a trickle of resplendent galaxy reflected in his clear eyes, giving out marvelous light. Luo Jianqing gazed at the starry sky quietly. After a long time, he said in a low voice, \u201cMo Qiu, the sky has witnessed the rise and fall of countless talented young men. Is the natural law really so merciless?\u201dA smile appeared on Mo Qiu\u2019s beautiful face. He sneered, \u201cWhat? Now you become sentimental?\u201dLuo Jianqing replied calmly, \u201cI just feel the natural law is unfair. It has given some people so many things that they don\u2019t deserve.\u201d\u201cMo Qiu smiled: \u201cLike what?\u201dLuo Jianqing continued, \u201cLike, some people don\u2019t make any efforts but attain a lot of precious instruments.\u201dMo Qiu said casually, \u201cThen you can overthrow the natural law.\u201dLuo Jianqing didn\u2019t know how to respond.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He gave Mo Qiu a glance, and turned to leave, \u201cDon\u2019t talk with me anymore, Mo Qiu. Fo Zi, I have to go back to Tai Hua mountain now. I have been homesick these days.\u201d He said as he walked away.Mo Qiu said angrily, \u201cLuo Jianqing, you bustard. Are you my sworn friend for life or death? We just got rid of the tremendous danger and you want to escape alone now? Get your ass back!\u201dLuo Jianqing waved his hands without turning back, \u201cSorry, I\u2019m getting too far to go back.\u201dMo Qiu was furious, \u201cYou!\u201dFo Zi beamed beside them, \u201cYou two are so close. But Cultivator Luo is right. After the Fiend Cultivator\u2019s massacre in Cen State, I have to return to Gui Yuan Sect and report to my masters and let them handle it, so I won\u2019t have time to entertain you. But we can rejoin on the Zen Debating Contest five years later. By then, I will come and invite you myself.\u201dMo Qiu stomped and looked at that gentle monk who had a fair and clean complexion, saying, \u201cNo, I won\u2019t go there.\u201dThen, Mo Qiu flew away, leaving Fo Zi alone, who was still beaming.Watching these fading figures, Fo Zi wore a brighter smile. He counted the beads on his hand and murmured, \u201cPeople always say the worldly life is bitter and tiring. They say life is a challenge, but it is true only because people are willing to accept it.\u201dThen, Fo Zi also turned into a flash of light and left quickly.It was not until two days journey that Luo Jianqing recalled he had left Qing Jun alone. He immediately doubled back on his tracks and saw a beautiful kid watching the sky on the peak not far from him.Luo Jianqing flew there quickly, but before he could say anything, Qing Jun said, \u201cI thought you abandoned me.\u201dHis throat feeling tight, Luo Jianqing recalled the words of Qing Jun.\u201cI have been waiting here for tens of millions of years. Before he left, he told me to play the zither for him on the peak and waited him to return after he won the battle. But that day never came. The world has changed now, and I\u2019ve never seen him after that.\u201dLuo Jianqing looked at him mildly and held Qing Jun\u2019s soft little hand. Luo Jianqing flew to the sky with him and mocked, \u201cI haven\u2019t expected that your heart would become smaller after your body shrank.\u201dQing Jun raised his head and gave Luo Jianqing a cold look without any response, but he held Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand more tightly.It took them only several days to arrive in the Liang State near the Tai Hua mountain. They were returning to the sect, so anyway they needed to\u2026 freshen up, otherwise, the younger disciples in the Tai Hua mountain would definitely laugh at them. Therefore, Luo Jianqing took Qing Jun to settle down at a lodge, and he went out to buy some new clothes.Qing Jun changed his clothes quickly, while Luo Jianqing was bathing and dressing in the next room.After bathing, Luo Jianqing wore a shirt. He suddenly narrowed his eyes and grabbed a book!Another book out of nowhere. Luo Jianqing had been accustomed to it, but the book\u2019s name made him speechless.Transforming to Deity III.Yeah, if you got II, there would be III. Luo Jianqing was curious about how many disgraceful books would appear.Anyway, he still opened this book and read it carefully. He finished over half of it soon and saw a lot of things connected with his previous life, and of course, many of these things were different from what he knew about his previous life, which made him more upset.When he read that he was expelled from the Tai Hua mountain, he was still calm.When he read that his second and sixth fellow younger brothers followed him to the Northern Land of Arctic, he clutched this page.Then\u2026When he read that Li Xiuchen fell into the cave, took the instrument of Mo\u2019s ancestors and released a powerful sword light by accident, which hit his second and sixth fellow younger brothers, Luo Jianqing\u2019s veins were throbbing in his temples and his eyes were bloodshot.Li Xiuchen! Why was it always him!His two fellow brothers were so innocent. They just followed him to the Northern Land of Arctic and then were killed by Li Xiuchen by accident.Now, Luo Jianqing finally realized why all people believed that he had killed his fellow brothers in his previous life.His sixth fellow brother, Xiu Hen, was from an instrument-making sect in Lie Huo peak. He was not powerful nor experienced in practicing, but he was talented in making instruments, so Sir Huo Mingzi liked him very much. Sir Huo Mingzi forged a jade tablet for him. If he was in danger, he could crush the tablet and send his message to Sir Huo Mingzi, no matter how far it was.Then, in Luo Jianqing\u2019s previous life, the last message his sixth fellow brother sent was \u201cBrother Luo, why did you kill us!\u201dSince then, Luo Jianqing had been wronged of killing fellow brothers and never had the chance to clear his name. Even Xuan Lingzi couldn\u2019t give an explanation, and Sir Huo Mingzi united all the other sects to go after Luo Jianqing, catch him back and revenge for Zuo Yunmo and Xiu Hen.In his previous life, Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t figure out why the sixth fellow brothers had left such a message.But now, he understood.In his previous life, when Luo Jianqing left, Li Xiuchen touched the forbidden instrument and released a sword light left by one of Mo\u2019s ancestors.That light was like a burning flame, forming a blue lotus in the sky, swallowing all the lives it could see.It was the \u201cOne Sword Turns Nine-Pedaled Lotus\u201d in True Nine-Petaled Lotus Record.Luo Jianqing couldn\u2019t understand why an unknown Mo\u2019s ancestor should possess such a powerful sword light, but his body couldn\u2019t help shaking. The more he read, the more upset he got. With bloodshot eyes, he turned to the last few pages.That day, Li Xiuchen came to Xuan Qingzi\u2019s house and told him that he would catch the traitor Luo Jianqing.Then, Xuan Lingzi came out gracefully and stood right in front of Li Xiuchen.\u201cThe grand master in white, who was handsome and elegant, frowned and asked, \u2018You want to go after your great senior brother?\u2019\u201dLi Xiuchen said with a lowered head, \u201cMaster, he is no longer my great senior brother.\u201dXuan Lingzi didn\u2019t rebut.After a while, Xuan Lingzi took out a sword. Just as this sword appeared, the wind went silent and time was frozen. Li Xiuchen looked at this sword with widened eyes. A cold light flashed on the sword and Xuan Lingzi\u2019s sigh-like voice came-\u201c\u2018Consider the presence of this sword as myself, bring back your great senior brother.\u2019\u201dLuo Jianqing\u2019s heart was shaken. A drop of tear running down from his eye and fell on the sentence \u201cbring back your great senior brother\u201d.In the end, you still regraded me as your disciple\u2026 In the end\u2026You never thought about killing me.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100 - The Truth is \u2013 Couple Cultivation Could Enhance Cultivation Base!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayHolding Qing Jun\u2019s hand, Luo Jianqing landed in front of the gate of Tai Hua Mountain.This time, the disciples who were guarding the gate learned their lesson from last time. Never did they shout for attention again. Greeting Luo Jianqing with all their respect, they let them pass quickly.Under the limpid firmament, seven peaks of Tai Hua Mountain stood solemnly, pointing at the sky. Lots of disciples were practicing combating skills on the fighting ground, while others went for in-door trainings, in order to enhance their cultivations. Luo Jianqing ignored all of these. He gripped Qing Jun\u2019s hand, went straight to Yu Xiao Peak, but before entering the gate, he suddenly stopped.With no expression on his cute elegant face, Qing Jun stood aside quietly.They spent a long time standing in front of the gate. Finding out Luo Jianqing had no intention to step in and go uphill, Qing Jun frowned, looking at Luo Jianqing with curiosity. Lifting his head, Qing Jun was stunned when he saw Luo Jianqing\u2019s expression. He held back everything he wanted to say.Slowly lifting his gaze, Luo Jianqing stared at the magnificent peak, perplexedly.Since he had his earliest memory, he\u2019s been living here with his Master.There were only two of them living on this whole peak. When Luo Jianqing was still a baby, Xuan Lingzi didn\u2019t know how to cook, and Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t practice Bigu until he grew up a little, so some other disciples would come to Yu Xiao Peak to serve meals. After Luo Jianqing learned how to cook and then finally achieved Bigu, the peak finally became a small world of their own.They became each other\u2019s one and only.Yesterday, Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t destroy Seeking Immortality III after finished reading. He knew it so well that such a book must be destroyed immediately and not be seen by anyone else, otherwise, the consequence might not be the one that he can take the responsibility for, but, still, he kept the book.Perhaps, he wanted to remind himself of how his two poor brothers died in misery for nothing; perhaps, he cherished the last sentence so much that he couldn\u2019t ask himself to tear the book asunder.Till the last moment, you were considering me as your disciple like always. Sir Huo Mingzi was so furious that he wanted my life, but you were still willing to trust me and protect me from being killed.You believed in me, and you never denied me.Gradually, Qing Jun felt Luo Jianqing gripped his hand harder and harder that he even started to feel painful, but he stayed silent.For tens of thousands of years, Qing Jun sat alone on the top of the steep mountain, playing an insipid song. Day after day, night after night, that one single song was played by him over and over again, and little by little, the once pleasant and exciting song turned to a prosaic requiem, but he never ceased playing.At this moment, Qing Jun could sense Luo Jianiqng\u2019s unsteadiness. Although he had no idea what went wrong with him, he didn\u2019t want to disturb Luo Jianqing.Finally, Luo Jianqing released his hand. Turning back to face Qing Jun, he said gently, \u201cSir, there is something I need to deal with. Could you please go back into the Interspatial Ring?\u201dQing Jun nodded, \u201cI want to practice in-door training for some days. If you need me for something, take out the pill and call my name. I\u2019m at your service at any time.\u201dLuo Jianqing nodded. Soon, Qing Jun transformed himself into a plume of light and flew into Luo Jianqing\u2019s Interspatial Ring.The next moment, Luo Jianqing tapped the ground with the tip of his feet, and in just a blink, he got to the top of Yu Xiao Peak. He slowed his pace, went through the bamboo forest, and crossed the field of Spiritual Herds. When he saw Xuan Lingzi who was waiting in front of their house, he stopped his steps.When their eyes first met in the air, with no reason why, Xuan Lingzi\u2019s face blushed. \u201cHow is your trip this time? Did you learn anything? Did you get injured?\u201dThere weren\u2019t any wounds or scars left on Luo Jianqing\u2019s body, and Xuan Lingzi already scanned him all over with his Spiritual Sense, confirmed that his beloved disciple was still in one piece. However, the Master still asked the question anyway, but he didn\u2019t get any response.Xuan Lingzi frowned, and then asked, \u201cJianqing?\u201dLuo Jianqing beamed winsomely and made his way toward his Master whose face was as red as a rose.The Master reeled back but Luo Jianqing caught his hand. Immediately, scorching temperature was delivered from Luo Jianqing\u2019s hand and burnt Xuan Lingzi. Heart rippling, the latter squinted.Luo Jianqing raised his head to look at him. \u201cMaster, if one day I sever the tie between me and Tai Hua Mountain, how would you deal with it?\u201dXuan Lingzi\u2019s body tensed up. Trying his best to calm down, he said, \u201cYou won\u2019t do that.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201dStaring at his disciple who was standing in front of him, Xuan Lingzi stretched out his arms and embosomed Luo Jianqing. He moved closer to his disciple\u2019s ear, and uttered gently, \u201cBecause, if you really sever the tie, the one and only choice I have is leaving Tai Hua Mountain with you.\u201dWarm breath reached Luo Jianqing\u2019s sensitive nape; causing a stir in his heart. He hugged Xuan Lingzi back, leaning his head on the shoulder of his Master, easing his mind in the light aroma of lotus.They drowned in that wonderful moment for a long time. Finally, Luo Jianqing broke the tranquility. \u201cMaster, several years ago, I got a book.\u201dSlightly astonished, Xuan Lingzi released Luo Jianqing from his arms, and lowered his head to look at his disciple.Under the splendid beam of sunlight, the young cultivator\u2019s eyes were as resplendent as shining stars. With a genial smile on his face, Luo Jianqing was still his gorgeous disciple no matter in this life or the last. Xuan Lingzi heard him spoke, word by word. \u201cThe book is called Seeking Immortality.\u201dThen, Luo Jianqing started to tell Xuan Lingzi everything he read in Seeking Immortality.When Xuan Lingzi knew he and Luo Jianiqng were just two characters of a book, as Luo Jianqing expected, he didn\u2019t have many reactions. Real cultivators were cultivating their egos. They believed in their existence and wouldn\u2019t doubt it just because of a book.However, as the story went on, Xuan Lingzi embraced Luo Jianqing tightly, face turning ashen.An unconcealed trace of rage emerged from the usual calm and expressionless visage. After Luo Jianqing finished, Xuan Lingzi lowered his head. Sparkling, their eyes met in the air.\u201cWu Yin, will you do the same thing the character \u2018Wu Yin\u2019 did in the book?\u201dHis body slightly tensed up, Xuan Lingzi quickly concealed his emotion and said calmly, \u201cI won\u2019t.\u201dLuo Jianqing couldn\u2019t hold it back anymore and beamed. Lifting his chin, the disciple kissed Xuan Lingzi\u2019s lips.Once they started kissing, it was difficult to stop.They hugged each other with all of their strength as if they craved to be fused into one. Lowering his head, Xuan Lingzi kissed Luo Jianqing while the latter closed his eyes and responded with excitement. Luo Jianqing didn\u2019t notice Xuan Lingzi\u2019s trembling fingers hidden beneath his sleeves and sweating forehead while he was telling the story of the book, as well as a beam of scarlet light flashing across his Master\u2019s eyes in a sudden.At that moment, Xuan Lingzi recalled the most desperate day in his life.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
