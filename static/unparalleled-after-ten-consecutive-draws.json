A large volume of memories surged upward in a frenzy and overwhelmed his mind.1After a brief moment, the young man lay on the bed gasping heavily for breath. His brow was beaded with sweat as the bewildered look in his eyes gradually cleared up.\u201cI never thought that something like this would happen to me.\u201d9The young man laughed helplessly.He understood everything after he took in all of the memories in his head.The young man was called Chu Kuangren, he was an outer sect disciple of Black Heaven Sect and was very popular there thanks to his handsome appearance.4His face, however, brought its fair share of problems as well. A True Elder Martial Sister fancied him because of this face of his and wanted to take him in as her personal male companion.2Yes, she wanted to keep him.16She even promised to promote him to the inner sect in three years.Even though Chu Kuangren was an outer sect disciple, he was arrogant and repulsed at these underhanded methods to achieve meteoric success in his career. As such, he sternly rejected her on the basis of righteousness.7Who would have thought that the Elder Martial Sister would fly into a rage out of humiliation? She heavily injured him out of anger, rendering him bedridden for two days without signs of improvement.4\u201cNot like I can change anything, might as well just accept it. I\u2019ll think of a way to survive now that I\u2019ve transmigrated to this person\u2019s body,\u201d Chu Kuangren murmured.10Ding\u2026\u201cYour plug-in [Fantasy Roulette] has arrived.\u201d1\u201cAs a first-time user, you have one 10x lucky draw to use. Will you use it now?\u201dA robotic female voice rang out in his mind.Chu Kuangren was baffled for a moment.Fantasy Roulette?Isn\u2019t this the game plug-in I downloaded before I transmigrated?11Could this be my golden finger?!11Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes lit up.Before transmigrating, he was playing an online Xianxia game and the Fantasy Roulette was a plug-in his roommate introduced to him.12\u201cI\u2019ll use it now,\u201d Chu Kuangren silently said in his heart.2Soon, a bright, rainbow-colored roulette with many boxes on it appeared in front of Chu Kuangren.On the other hand, the names of the rewards in the boxes sounded like they would scare people very much.Something like Miraculous Nine Suns, Immortal Body, Yin and Yang Ring\u2026The pointer on the roulette spun rapidly.\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled the Legendary Banished Immortal Aura.\u201d6\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled one Starlight Spirit Gathering Array.\u201d1\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled the God-tier constitution, Immortal Body.\u201d3\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled the God-tier Remarkable Eye of Revelation.\u201d7\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled one Starlight Human Mountain Stamp.\u201d4\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled one Starlight Life Extension Pill.\u201d3\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled the Legendary constitution, Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart.\u201d8\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled one Starlight Treasure Map.\u201d1\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled one Legendary Winged Soldier.\u201d1\u201cCongratulations, the host has pulled one Legendary Yin and Yang Ring.\u201d6Notification sounds kept ringing in Chu Kuangren\u2019s mind in a continuous stream.He couldn\u2019t help but swallow his saliva.Never did he expect that plug-in to actually be good.10\u201cThe above items above have already been placed into the roulette room, please make sure to check and accept them.\u201d The female robotic voice faded out once it finished speaking.The roulette in front of Chu Kuangren disappeared as well.The Fantasy Roulette was a plug-in Chu Kuangren downloaded before he transmigrated; it gave players the chance to draw prizes once a day.The prizes were separated into the following grades: Iron, Silver, Gold, Diamond, Starlight, Legendary, God, Transcendent, and Eternal.14The 10 consecutive lucky draws were a privilege for new players which guaranteed pulls of Starlight grade and even above that.Chu Kuangren opened the roulette room which was an interface that resembled an item box in a game.He inhaled deeply and barely managed to calm himself down as he looked at the dazzling lineup of prizes he had just pulled.\u201cRetrieve Immortal Body,\u201d Chu Kuangren muttered to himself.1An extremely terrifying surge of power immediately erupted in his body all of a sudden. This surge of power engulfed his limbs and bones and washed over his skin, muscles, bones, flesh \u2013 every single cell in his body!Chu Kuangren felt as though he had been thrown into a gigantic blender; his body was constantly being mixed and broken down before being regrouped again, mixed and broken down\u2026\u201cF**k!!!\u201dChu Kuangren almost fainted on the spot due to the excruciating pain, but a magical kind of power in his brain kept him awake.7Thankfully, this pain didn\u2019t last for long.After one minute, Chu Kuangren lay on the ground drenched in sweat. \u201cThis kind of feeling\u2026 really is bloody exciting!\u201d26He got up and sat on a chair as his mind received information regarding the Immortal Body. After that, he couldn\u2019t help but click his tongue in wonder.Chu Kuangren activated the spirit energy on his right hand and condensed it to his fingertips. After which, he struck the palm of his left hand, immediately opening a bloody wound.Immediately after that, however, the flesh on his palm started regrowing and recovered rapidly. It was reverted back to its regular form in the blink of an eye and not a single scar remained where his wound was.1\u201cThe Immortal Body has six states, I\u2019m only at the first state and yet its effects are this potent? My body has already completely healed from the severe injuries Li Yao inflicted on me. How terrifying are the five other realms behind this?\u201d3A smile appeared on Chu Kuangren\u2019s face as he looked at the roulette room.What other wonderful uses did the rest of the prizes have?\u201cRetrieve Eye of Revelation.\u201d3A glimmer swirled around in Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes. Upon closer inspection, there were countless large Daoist runes circulating around in his eyes; it was incomparably mysterious.5The glimmer dwindled and his eyes went back to normal.He felt the effects of the glimmer rest within him.Chu Kuangren nodded in satisfaction.The Eye of Revelation could reveal all fabrications in the world and even clearly extract information about one\u2019s race, cultivation, skill and so on.15This was a God-tier prize so it wasn\u2019t inferior to the Immortal Body in the slightest bit.2\u201cRetrieve Banished Immortal Aura.\u201dChu Kuangren walked over to the copper mirror in the house and looked at himself. He felt that there was suddenly a refined and pure aura around him. In addition to his handsome face, it was just as though he embodied a deity that had been banished to the world of the living.3In one word, he was handsome.In two words, he was bloody handsome.38Once he was finished admiring himself, Chu Kuangren looked at the few prizes left in the roulette room with a speculative expression on his face.Other than the Immortal Body, the Eye of Revelation, and the Banished Immortal Aura, the original owner of the body more or less already embodied the remaining prizes\u2019 effects.Especially in relation to that Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart.This was ranked in the top ten out of the 3,000 constitutions in Firmament Star.It has been over ten thousand years since it appeared in the world.Once people were privy to the appearance of a constitution like this, all kinds of strange occurrences would follow suit.\u00a0When that moment arose, the entire Black Heaven Sect would be startled.11Chu Kuangren muttered irresolutely to himself for a moment before a firm expression flitted across his face. \u201cWhat harm would they do, even if they were alerted?\u201d9\u201cThe Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart is a Supreme Daoist Physique. Those who possess this physique are supreme children of the heavens that every major force would want for themselves. It would be ideal if I could astound the higher-ups; the resources of Black Heaven Sect will definitely lean in my favor then.\u201d10\u201cIf I let every little thing stop me, how can I reach the peak of cultivation in the future? I would be better off looking for a place where I can cultivate in a practical manner.\u201d1\u201cMy name is Chu Kuangren! How could I not be insane or wild?\u201d6Chu Kuangren grinned. \u201cRetrieve Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart.\u201dHis body was immediately enhanced with a surge of indescribable power.The physical transformation was extremely painful this time too; it was as though countless tiny needles were shuttling through his veins and converging toward his heart.However, it was much better than when he was merging with the Immortal Body before.The original owner of the body had a tenacious will, so Chu Kuangren naturally inherited his willpower when the memories of the original owner merged with him.16An anomaly arose in the external realm corresponding to the moment when Chu Kuangren retrieved the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart.Regardless of the level of their cultivation, the long swords in the hands of countless cultivators in Black Heaven Sect started trembling inexplicably as they unleashed hums that charged into the sky.Novel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter>",

There were even waves of Daoist chants coming from it.The runes intertwined in the light beam and turned into the shape of a heart.There were nine orifices in this heart and sword qi shuttled back and forth whenever it throbbed. The sound of gold and metal colliding with each other could be heard amid the thumping heartbeat.\u201cW-what\u2019s going on?!\u201d\u201cFor there to be an anomaly of this level, could it possible that some kind of Daoist physique has awakened?!\u201d\u201cNine orifices born in a heart that contains sword qi. Could this be the legendary Supreme Daoist Physique\u2026 the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart?!!!\u201d1\u201cTch, it\u2019s been almost ten thousand years since this Daoist physique appeared in the world, right? How could it suddenly appear, and even in Black Heaven Sect\u2019s territory no less!?\u201d4\u201cThat\u2019s from\u2026 the outer sect courtyard.\u201d\u201cIs it possible that this constitution awakened in an outer sect disciple?\u201d\u201cHow can it be possible?!\u201d3This abrupt anomaly startled everyone in Black Heaven Sect, from the paramount Elders to the outer sect disciples.As the fusion between Chu Kuangren and the sword heart went deeper, the might of that anomaly kept increasing too and spread outside Black Heaven Sect.In a moment, most of the powerhouses in Azure Dragon Domain could sense this.In a vast city.A man dressed in white sitting upright in a tall building abruptly opened his eyes and looked in the direction of Black Heaven Sect. \u201cThis aura is the birth of a Supreme Daoist Physique!\u201dSupreme Daoist Physiques had only appeared a few times in written history.6Any random Supreme Daoist Physique had the potential to achieve the Emperor Realm.In the history of Firmament Star, there were not many almighty cultivators who achieved the Emperor Realm at all.\u201cBlack Heaven Sect is in that direction. Could there be a young Emperor from Black Heaven Sect in this era? That\u2019s amusing.\u201dThe man in white laughed softly before his eyes closed slightly, signalling his nonchalance.2\u2026\u2026\u2026In a dazzling main hall.A domineering man sat on the throne and gazed in the direction of Black Heaven Sect as he muttered, \u201cA Supreme Daoist Physique! I never thought that another Supreme Daoist Physique would appear in this era again. Heh, it really is the era of war!\u201d\u201cBut no matter who it is, in this generation, the imperial throne belongs to no one other than I!\u201d2\u201cWhoever fights with me will meet his end!\u201d8\u2026\u2026\u2026An old man was sitting on a blood-colored lotus seat bearing a thrashing sea of blood. He looked into the distance as he sensed something and his face abruptly sank.\u201cThe aura of a Supreme Daoist Physique!\u201d\u201cCould it be from that Black Heaven Sect? Humph, it looks like I have to speed things up and incubate that Blood Spirit Daoist Fetus a little earlier.\u201d4\u201cOnly then will I be able to seize the imperial throne in this lifetime.\u201d1\u201cThe competition is really heating up.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026In Black Heaven Sect.The power of the anomaly increased together with the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart.A group of swordsmen could no longer control the swords in their hands. Countless swords flew out of their owners\u2019 hands and turned into a flow of light as they flew toward where Chu Kuangren was.2There was a mountain peak completely stabbed full of swords in the distance.All of a sudden, the mountain peak rumbled and shook!Swords soared one after the other and flew toward where Chu Kuangren was as well.\u201cF*ck! That\u2019s a sword from Black Heaven Sword Mountain!\u201d\u201cQuickly look at that, that\u2019s the sacred weapon, Purple Firmament Sword!!!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not only the Purple Firmament Sword, there\u2019s also the Azure Vine, Crimson Drill, Dragon\u2019s Cry, and Tai\u2019e\u2026 these are all saint weapons!!!\u201d9\u201cBlack Heaven Sect is known for its swordsmanship. Disciples have to leave for Sword Mountain and choose a sword to accompany them when they enter the sect. Rumor has it, there are Ten Great Sacred Swords and very few disciples can obtain their acknowledgment! In this generation, only Daoist Nan Gonghuang obtained the recognition of the sacred weapon, Deep Pool Rainbow.\u201d6\u201cBut these sacred weapons have all flown over on their own now. From the looks of it, they can\u2019t wait to acknowledge their masters on their own. This is too inconceivable! Who exactly is responsible for this?!\u201d\u201cThe sacred weapons are acknowledging someone as their master of their own accord? How terrifying!\u201dIt was incomparably majestic as countless swords hovered above the courtyard.Silhouettes arrived around the courtyard one after the other. An old man with white eyebrows amongst them loudly called out, \u201cThe disciple in the courtyard, please show yourself!\u201dA door opened with a creak.Chu Kuangren slowly walked out slowly dressed in the white uniform donned by outer sect disciples.\u00a0It was just as though he was a Daoist sword deity with the legendary swords hovering around him on top of his handsome face and the refined aura he exuded.Everyone couldn\u2019t take their eyes off him when they saw him.\u201cWho is this person? He looks very proper and handsome.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too handsome, and with a refined aura like this, I would believe you if you said he was the reincarnation of some immortal. There is actually a person of such outstanding talent in the outer sect?\u201d2\u201cIf this person was a girl, they would be as beautiful as a jade; if this person was a man, they would be an elegant son of a noble.\u201d6\u201cIt\u2019s him, Chu Kuangren.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be, it really is Chu Kuangren. He was handsome in the past, but not to such a ridiculous extent, right? How could he change so much in the two days that we haven\u2019t seen him. Is he also the one who awakened a Supreme Daoist Physique?\u201d\u201cI heard a True Elder Martial Sister wanted to keep him, but he rejected her. Elder Martial Sister seriously injured him out of anger, so he should be lying on the bed now. I never thought that he actually caused this disturbance.\u201d\u201cShoot, it\u2019s no wonder why that True Elder Martial Sister wanted to keep this person for herself. If I were in her shoes, I wouldn\u2019t be able to help myself either.\u201d1\u201cWake up, you\u2019re a man.\u201d24The disciples\u2019 tongues were wagging, some were amazed while some were shocked whereas others were infatuated. Evidently, Chu Kuangren\u2019s Banished Immortal Aura had shocked many people.3A female Elder with outstanding good looks inevitably had a strange expression on her face after she saw Chu Kuangren high up in the air. A hint of a ripple surfaced in her mental state, which was one that resembled an ancient well devoid of ripples. \u201cIsn\u2019t it against the rules for him to have an aura and face like this?\u201d9At this moment, Chu Kuangren had already finished merging with the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart. The anomaly in the sky above the courtyard disappeared as well, but those innumerable swords were still hovering above him and did not disperse for a very long time.There were a few swords that stood out the most amongst them; jeweled light swirled around the bodies of the swords which also had large prominent Daoist runes on them. The remaining swords didn\u2019t dare to get too close at all under the pressuring might of these few swords.1\u2018Do they want to acknowledge me as their master???\u2019Sacred swords had spirits. Chu Kuangren seemed to be able to perceive the thoughts of these swords and he couldn\u2019t help but feel amazed. Who knew the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart was this charming?2Perhaps it is to say that this was the overlapping effect of the Sword Heart and the Banished Immortal Aura?Nevertheless, Chu Kuangren did not dare do as he pleased now no matter what. These sacred weapons were Black Heaven Sect\u2019s most valuable treasures. What would the other disciples, and even the Elders, think if all of them acknowledged him as their master?3A Daoist physique had just awakened in him and he was itching to take the sacred weapons for himself.It would be difficult for him to put himself in a powerful position with a temperament like that.Chu Kuangren ignored the sacred weapons around him and walked directly toward the old man with the white eyebrows. He bowed and made his salutations.\u201cOuter sect disciple Chu Kuangren pays his respects to all the Elders.\u201d1The old man with white eyebrows nodded in satisfaction. \u2018He can resist the temptation of the sacred weapon. Not bad, not bad, this boy really does have somewhat of a heart.\u2019Chu Kuangren immediately guessed what the other party was thinking when he saw the expression on the old white-browed man\u2019s face. \u2018Heh, all in a day\u2019s work.\u2019\u201cChu Kuangren, were you responsible for this anomaly?\u201d\u201cIt is probable.\u201dChu Kuangren put on a look of hesitation.\u201cWhat do you mean, probable?\u201d\u201cElder, I was resting in the house today but all of a sudden, my body was in unbearable pain as though I was being hacked to pieces. Immediately after that, a beam of light shot out from my body, and then this happened,\u201d said Chu Kuangren.He couldn\u2019t reveal the Fantasy Roulette, so he could only pretend that the Daoist physique suddenly awakened in him for the time being.\u201cOh.\u201d The old man with white eyebrows was right in front of Chu Kuangren in a flash. He grabbed Chu Kuangren\u2019s arm and injected a whiff of spirit energy into him to examine him.Chu Kuangren let the other party do as he pleased and did not move an inch.A moment later, the old man with white eyebrows looked ecstatic as he burst out laughing and excitedly said, \u201cIt really is the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart! The heavens really are protecting my Black Heaven Sect! We actually have a Supreme Daoist Physique in this generation!!!\u201d8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It set off a huge commotion and a group of Elders ran up to Chu Kuangren one after the other.\u201cIt really is the Exquisit Nine Orifices Sword Heart, this really is splendid.\u201d2\u201cThe heavens really are protecting my Black Heaven Sect!\u201d\u201cBlack Heaven Sect can fight for the imperial throne in this era with this Supreme Daoist Physique!\u201d2\u201cOut of 3,000 physiques, the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart is ranked in the top ten. It\u2019s a supreme physique for the cultivation of swordsmanship, and what\u2019s more, my Black Heaven Sect is established in this world for its cultivation of swordsmanship! Hahaha, what is this if not the will of the heavens?!\u201d5\u201cEven though this boy is from the outer sect, we need to nurture him vigorously since a Supreme Daoist Physique has awakened in him now. Why don\u2019t we make him a True Disciple?\u201d1\u201cHow is True Disciple enough? We must bestow the title of Daoist upon him!\u201d5\u201cThere is going to be one more Daoist amongst the nine great Daoists in my Black Heaven Sect.\u201d2At this moment, the Sword Mountain located in the distance suddenly rumbled.The swords hovering in the sky flew back one by one as though they were being summoned.On the other hand, those few sacred weapons were reluctant to part with Chu Kuangren as they spun around beside him. However, they still flew back in the direction of Sword Mountain in the end.Chu Kuangren was stunned for a moment.\u2018Hey, don\u2019t go!\u2018One of you should stay at the very least, right?\u2018You came willy-nilly and you\u2019re leaving as you please, are you guys toying with me?\u2018You guys were even behaving as though you wouldn\u2019t acknowledge anyone else but me just now, now you\u2019re gone.1\u2018Humph, sword scum.1\u201cThe Sect Master prompted the Sword Mountain and retrieved the swords,\u201d said the old man with white hair.\u201cBring the boy to see me.\u201d A magnetic middle-aged voice that was deep and low could be heard coming from a distance.The old man with white eyebrows smiled at Chu Kuangren and said, \u201cFollow me.\u201d\u201cYes, Elder.\u201dThe old man with white eyebrows flicked his sleeves. An invisible power enveloped Chu Kuangren\u2019s body and he actually rose high up into the air involuntarily.Several Elders took Chu Kuangren and turned into a stream of light before shooting into the distance. Soon, they arrived at a sumptuous main hall.A middle-aged man dressed in white robes stood in this large hall.The young man had a pure and handsome face with graying hair on both sides of his temples. He exuded a kind of immortal elegance paired with the spirit of a Daoist cultivator. This person was the present Sect Master of Black Heaven Sect\u2026 Honorable Xuan Qi.5\u201cWe pay our respects to the Sect Master.\u201dA few Elders went up to him and bowed at him.Honorable Xuan Qi nodded slightly before his gaze fell on Chu Kuangren. He sized the other party up with a strange look in his eyes.2\u201cAs expected, a Supreme Daoist Physique really moves one with its elegance.\u201d1\u201cYou\u2019re flattering me, Sect Master.\u201d\u201cHeh, you don\u2019t need to be modest. I want to take you in as my disciple, so you\u2019ll be the Lead Disciple of Black Heaven Sect from now on. I wonder whether you\u2019d be willing to.\u201dNot only was Chu Kuangren somewhat shocked when he heard this, but the rest of the disciples were gobsmacked too. They never thought that the Sect Master would place such great importance on Chu Kuangren.3He was actually granting him the position of Lead Disciple immediately.However, on second thought there was nothing out of the ordinary.This was the first time in the history of the Black Heaven Sect where a Supreme Daoist Physique had appeared.\u201cMy utmost respect to you, my master.\u201dChu Kuangren immediately bowed down to him.6He had no reason to refuse because he initially thought that it was pretty good if he could pass for a Daoist. He never thought that Honorable Xuan Qi would be so generous and make him everyone\u2019s Eldest Martial Brother right away, so he shouldn\u2019t refuse such a fine thing.\u201cGood! Good!\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi laughed elatedly.By taking in a Supreme Daoist Physique as his disciple, he would share in the honor as well when Chu Kuangren grew up in the future. If Chu Kuangren became the Heavenly Emperor, he would be the Emperor\u2019s Teacher. How many people have had such an honor since ancient times?8\u201cYou will follow me and cultivate with me from tomorrow onwards.\u201d\u201cYes, master.\u201dAfter becoming Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s disciple, the treatment of Chu Kuangren\u2019s social status practically jumped by leaps and bounds. He immediately moved from a small courtyard to a vast Daoist palace and he even had a few personal maids waiting on him.The next day.Chu Kuangren woke up on the huge bed in his room. He opened his eyes and surveyed his surroundings. \u201cI wasn\u2019t dreaming, it looks like I really transmigrated.\u201dHe got up and summoned the Fantasy Roulette in his heart.\u201cBegin today\u2019s raffle.\u201d1Bright rays of light spun in his field of vision and an enormous roulette appeared.1At this moment, someone knocked at the door.\u201cCome in,\u201d Chu Kuangren said in a dull tone.A young lady with a graceful physique, red lips, and white teeth walked in carrying a basin of water. \u201cYoung Master, it\u2019s time to wash up.\u201d3The young lady glanced at Chu Kuangren with a slightly reddened face. She was also an outer sect disciple in Black Heaven Sect and was chosen to wait on Chu Kuangren yesterday.She did not mind it in the slightest, though.After all, things were very different for Chu Kuangren now. He was a disciple directly under the Sect Master\u2019s guidance and the Lead Disciple of Black Heaven Sect. His position was even above that of a Daoist.To her, following Chu Kuangren was no different from reaching the heavens in a single bound.\u2018What\u2019s more, this Young Master Chu is so handsome.\u201d The young lady secretly thought to herself.\u201cWhat is your name?\u201d asked Chu Kuangren.\u201cI am Liu Bing.\u201d\u201cLiu Bing\u2026 then I\u2019ll call you Lil Bing from now on.\u201d12\u201cIf the Young Master so wishes.\u201dChu Kuangren could confirm that Little Bing didn\u2019t see the Fantasy Roulette because it seemed like no one else could see it but him.He said the word \u201cdraw\u201d within himself and the roulette started spinning.1\u201cCongratulations, the host has obtained the Iron grade Spirit Gathering Pill.\u201d4Spirit Gathering Pill?An Iron grade one at that too?The corner of Chu Kuangren\u2019s lips twitched twice.Compared to the ten consecutive lucky draws yesterday, this Spirit Gathering Pill was simply nothing to shout about because his current self could get as many of them as he wanted.1Forget it, this was an inherent issue of chance anyway.Chu Kuangren placed the Spirit Gathering Pill in the roulette room and didn\u2019t bother with it for the time being. He washed his face and put on an entirely new set of clothes.\u201cYoung Master looks really good in this set of clothes.\u201dLittle Bing couldn\u2019t help but have a look of admiration on her face as she looked at Chu Kuangren.4He wore a jade cap on his head and was donned in a set of long, wide-sleeved white robes with golden embroidery on it in the image of a\u00a0qilin1.10Adding that refined aura on top of all that, Chu Kuangren was currently no different than a banished immortal. Little Bing couldn\u2019t find any words to describe him.3\u201cIt\u2019s okay.\u201d Chu Kuangren smiled in satisfaction.After he tidied up his appearance, Chu Kuangren went to look for Honorable Xuan Qi.Black Heaven Sect, Longevity Hall.Honorable Xuan Qi was sitting on a praying mat.Chu Kuangren arrived and gave a small bow, \u201cGreetings, master.\u201d\u201cAh, you\u2019ve come. Sit.\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi pointed at the praying mat beside him and taught Chu Kuangren what to do. After which, he said, \u201cKuangren, you were an outer sect disciple before so you could only learn the basic techniques in Black Heaven Sect. You now have the honor of being the Lead Disciple so you already have the right to learn Sage Techniques. My Black Heaven Sect has Three Great Sage Techniques\u2026You can cultivate tyrannical sword qi beyond compare with the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art.7Once you\u2019ve successfully cultivated the Golden Time Immemorial Light Art, you will have an endless flow of spirit energy. What\u2019s more, there will be a golden light protecting your body and no attack can destroy it. This technique is an offensive and defensive one.4There is also the Divine Nine Suns Art which will strengthen your spirit energy, making it ferocious and tyrannical. Once you\u2019ve cultivated it to perfection, you can create a vision of there being nine suns in the same sky and draw on the power of the sun.8I wonder which type you want to learn out of these three?\u201d\u201cI want to learn the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art.\u201d7Chu Kuangren chose his target almost without any hesitation at all.He had the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart which was an incomparable gift along the path of swordsmanship cultivation. There was no need for him to reject what was near and to seek what was far away by learning other techniques.Among the three great Sage Techniques, the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art was the most suitable one for him.\u201cYes, your choice is as expected.\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi nodded and retrieved a jade scroll after that before handing it to Chu Kuangren. \u201cThe Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art is recorded within this. The amount you can comprehend all depends on your fortune. If you encounter anything you don\u2019t understand in the process of cultivation, don\u2019t hesitate to come and find me.\u201d\u201cYes, Master.\u201d Chu Kuangren took the jade scroll offered to him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 4": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 4Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTowering Heaven Palace, the Daoist Palace Chu Kuangren lived in.When he returned, Chu Kuangren started researching the jade scroll that was in his hands. His mind stirred slightly and a large amount of information from the jade scroll poured into his brain.Chu Kuangren began to digest this information.Soon, he opened his eyes, from which rays of light started to emit.\u201cTsk, the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art. This technique definitely is one of the very best in the Azure Dragon Domain. It really didn\u2019t disappoint me.\u201dAs the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, Chu Kuangren was unmatched in aptitude when it came to swordsmanship. Thus, he had almost finished comprehending the sword art in just a moment.If anyone else was placed in this position, it would be impossible for them to comprehend one or two-tenths of this sword art in less than 190 days even if they were the peerless prodigies.5The realms of the world were divided into Body Forging, Qi Refinement, Foundation Establishment, Golden Core, Nascent Soul, Paradise, Battle Monarch, Honorable, Ascension, Sage Manifestation, and Emperor Realm respectively.13The so-called Sage Techniques were techniques that the almighty Sage Manifestors could create. One could cultivate said techniques until the Sage Manifestation Realm.There were only but a few almighty Sage Manifestors in the entire Firmament Star.As such, one only needed to imagine how precious Sage Techniques were.After looking through the sword art once over, Chu Kuangren started retrieving the remaining prizes in the roulette room. The first one he took out was the Yin and Yang Ring, items essential to cultivators.Ordinary Yin and Yang Rings were only several tens of square meters in size.9Yet Chu Kuangren\u2019s Yin and Yang Rings were so wide it was as though it could fit an entire ocean; it was almost boundless.As expected of a Legendary grade item.1There was also the Human Mountain Stamp which was a kind of combat technique.3Since it was directly imported from the Fantasy Roulette into his brain, Chu Kuangren practically did not need to make an attempt at understanding it as his comprehension about it was extremely thorough.The only thing left for him to do was cultivate.This Human Mountain Stamp Art was actually not inferior to the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art. In fact, it was possibly even more mysterious than the former which amazed Chu Kuangren.2\u201cIt looks like Starlight grade techniques are equivalent to Sage Techniques, and they could even be slightly higher than the latter. It\u2019s almost close to that of an Emperor\u2019s Scripture technique.\u201dChu Kuangren placed the few remaining items into the Yin and Yang Ring, namely the Life Extension Pill and the Treasure Map, which were both of the Starlight grade.He then fused the remaining Starlight grade Spirit Gathering Array with the Towering Heaven Palace he was at. All of a sudden, mysterious changes occurred around the entire Daoist Palace. It turned into a kind of force field that was gathering large quantities of spiritual qi.1Lil Bing who was currently cultivating in her bedroom abruptly opened her eyes with a look of shock on her face. \u201cWhy is there so much concentrated spirit qi?!\u201d2One of the keys to cultivation was the concentration of spirit qi. The greater the concentration of spirit qi in the area, the more effort saved in cultivation, and the better the results.The mountain region Black Heaven Sect was located in was a piece of inherently precious land with an abundance of spirit qi. However, Lil Bing realized that her cultivation in Towering Heaven Daoist Palace was over ten times better compared to the outer realm. How could she not be shocked about that?\u201cCould this be some kind of magic Spirit Gathering Array? I didn\u2019t expect Sect Master and the others to place such great importance on the Young Master. They went so far as to set up a magic array in the Daoist Palace that gathers spirit qi from heavens and earth to aid Young Master\u2019s cultivation!\u201d Lil Bing softly murmured.At present, this was the only explanation.However, even the Black Heaven Sect had to spend quite a lot of money to set up a Spirit Gathering Array of this grade, right? In addition to that, the range of its coverage could not be too big either, the widest it could extend to was within the confines of Towering Heaven Daoist Palace.Lil Bing continued cultivating happily once she finished her mind illustration. With this magic array around, the circumstances in which she was cultivating was leaps better than when she was in the outer sect.In his room.Chu Kuangren also sensed that the Daoist Palace had changed after it fused with the Spirit Gathering Array. He smiled in satisfaction before looking at the final prize.\u201cOne Legendary grade Winged Human Soldier! Winged Human? Is it that race I\u2019m familiar with?\u201d Chu Kuangren took it out right away.6A silver light blossomed before him and turned into a white ball of light. A pair of pure white wings abruptly spread out and the entire room was immediately filled with a kind of divine aura.Once the light dissipated, Chu Kuangren could clearly see who the wings belonged to. He could not help but reveal a hint of how he found her breathtaking from the look in his eyes.11This woman was exceptionally beautiful and divine with her pure white wings and her long silver hair draped on her shoulders, which rested on her silver pauldrons.15She had delicate facial features and her light blue eyes resembled the sea. There was an aura of heroism around her as her curvaceous body was covered in silver armor engraved with gorgeous decorative designs beyond comparison.\u201cAn angel?\u201d Chu Kuangren blinked.The girl before his eyes certainly did have a stark resemblance to the legendary angels from his previous life.However, they were called Winged Humans in this world.Winged Humans were one of the races on Firmament Star. Every single Winged Human was valiant and excellent at fighting, and they even possessed an outstanding gift in cultivation.Mysterious large Daoist Runes twinkled in Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes as he activated the Remarkable Eye of Revelation.\u201cWinged Human Race. The age has been set to 12 years old and the cultivation level is at Nascent Soul. Oh, it\u2019s even equipped with the Supreme Daoist Physique, Holy Radiant Physique\u2026 It\u2019s no surprise then that this character has been determined to be Legendary grade when they\u2019re only at the Nascent Soul stage\u2026\u201d24Golden words resembling a stream of information flashed across Chu Kuangren\u2019s retinas. In just an instant, he understood everything about the Winged Human Soldier standing before his eyes.What surprised him was that the other party actually had a Holy Radiant PhysiqueThis was also a kind of Supreme Daoist Physique. Even though it was inferior to the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, it could be ranked in the top 20 among the 3,000 constitutions.1The Winged Soldier approached Chu Kuangren and knelt with one knee on the ground. She clutched her right hand into a fist and placed it on her heart as she respectfully said, \u201cI pay my respects, master.\u201d2Her clear and cold voice was as refreshing as a clear spring.Regardless of whether they were humans or items, every prize drawn from the Fantasy Roulette belonged to Chu Kuangren.1Therefore, it wasn\u2019t strange for the Winged Human Soldier to call him Master.\u201cDo you have a name?\u201d2\u201cMaster is my creator, please grant me a name.\u201dChu Kuangren was her creator; he was a supreme existence resembling God and was the person she respected from the bottom of her heart.For such a valiant and formidable-looking young lady to call him Master, Chu Kuangren had to admit, it fully satisfied his vanity.8\u201cGet up first.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThe Winged Soldier stood up and stood respectfully to the side. Her eyes that resembled sapphire twinkled with a hopeful glint as she looked at Chu Kuangren.She was evidently waiting expectantly for Chu Kuangren to bestow her with a name.Chu Kuangren muttered irresolutely to himself.He had read books before but he found it difficult to come up with a name that was rich with poetic meaning.\u201cWings, blue eyes\u2026\u201d\u201cFrom now on, let\u2019s call you\u2026 Lan Yu.\u201d8Chu Kuangren wracked his brain to choose a fairly pleasing name.A light shined in front of Lan Yu\u2019s eyes. \u201cThank you for bestowing a name onto me, Master.\u201d\u2018Yes, superb.\u2019It seemed as though this young lady was rather pleased.Chu Kuangren smiled and said, \u201cYou don\u2019t need to call Master or anything like that from now on. Call me Young Master, it\u2019s more pleasing to the ears.\u201d8He initially wanted to let Lan Yu call him by his name, but he then thought of how it would not be too appropriate if she called him\u00a0\u201cKuangren\u201d1\u00a0in front of others in the future. It would make him seem like he considered everyone beneath himself.So it would be better for her to call him Young Master.\u201cYes, Young Master,\u201d Lan Yu nodded.\u201cOh right, can you change your clothes? Even though this looks very good on you, it attracts a little too much attention,\u201d Chu Kuangren said.This was not the army, who would wear armor the entire day?\u201cYoung Master, this radiant armor is my magic item, I don\u2019t have any other clothes to change into,\u201d said Lan Yu.\u201cThat\u2019s easy. I\u2019ll get Lil Bing to prepare them for you.\u201d Chu Kuangren took out a voice transmission compass and asked Lil Bing to prepare clothes for Lan Yu.\u201cYoung Master, what style do you want? And what size?\u201dLil Bing\u2019s puzzled voice could be heard coming from the compass.\u201cAnything will do, as long as it\u2019s a size smaller than what you wear. Oh right, you have to prepare an entire set. I need a top, outerwear, undergarments, and shoes too.\u201d2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 5": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 5Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayTowering Heaven Daoist Palace.Lil Bing was holding a set of female clothes outside Chu Kuangren\u2019s room.She was confused.Why did this Young Master want female clothes for no reason?A full set as well, could it be that he had some special obsession?2\u201cYoung Master, I\u2019ve brought the clothes.\u201dLil Bing knocked on the door and it opened with a creak, but she noticed that there was another woman in Chu Kuangren\u2019s room.It was a very beautiful woman.Beauty like that would put anyone to shame. Even Lil Bing couldn\u2019t help but feel a sense of shame from her inferiority when she saw the woman.Wait a minute.Why did this beautiful woman seem to have a pair of wings?\u201cThank you for your trouble.\u201d Chu Kuangren took the clothes before turning around and handing it to Lan Yu, who was standing behind him. \u201cWear this for the time being.\u201dLan Yu took the clothes from him. \u201cYes.\u201dA burst of white light flickered and the armor on Lan Yu\u2019s body disappeared in a flash.A shining white body that was infinitely beautiful presented itself before Chu Kuangren and Lil Bing. Her snow-white skin almost made their eyes go dizzy.Chu Kuangren felt as though blood was about to spurt out of his nose soon whereas Lil Bing who stood beside him had her mouth hanging wide open.4\u2018F-f*ck!\u2019Was this woman so open?!8Lan Yu, on the other hand, didn\u2019t think much about it. She calmly changed in front of the duo with an indifferent look on her face; she wasn\u2019t concerned at all.From her perspective, Chu Kuangren was her creator, so all of her belonged to him. Naturally, that included this body of hers.1\u201cUh, change your clothes first.\u201dChu Kuangren closed the door in a hurry and walked outside to wait for her.Phew\u2026 This was too stimulating.12Even though Lan Yu definitely wouldn\u2019t refuse him if he wanted to do anything to her, Chu Kuangren\u2019s thoughts still hadn\u2019t gone in that direction for the time being.18Other than using some special cultivation techniques, cultivators maintained Nascent Yang physiques at the early stages. As such, they could advance their cultivation above a certain level.This was also one of the reasons why he initially rejected being kept under a mistress.\u201cYoung Master, who is this young lady?\u201dLil Bing\u2019s mind was filled with question marks now.She had just disappeared for a moment, so why was there another person by the Young Master\u2019s side?She was even a remarkably beautiful woman. If a person of this level was a disciple from the Black Heaven Sect, she should have been famous a long time ago.\u201cShe\u2019s my attendant, you don\u2019t need to ask more about it.\u201d\u201cI understand.\u201dLil Bing obediently nodded.Chu Kuangren nodded in satisfaction. A few maids had been dispatched to serve him, but he only kept one person, and that was Lil Bing.It was exactly because the other party was docile and did as she told that he settled on her.She wouldn\u2019t bring up things she shouldn\u2019t ask.A while later.The door to the room opened.2Lan Yu walked out and, as a woman, even Lil Bing felt her heart throb as though it had been struck all out of nowhere as she looked at the woman.She was stunning.The traditional Chinese skirt alternating between blue and white accentuated Lan Yu\u2019s seductive curves. On the other hand, her long silver hair was simply bunched up on the back of her head.10Her skin was smooth and fair whereas her eyebrows resembled jade feathers. Above all, her light blue eyes were bewitching; they were clear and bright and seemed as though they were hiding shining stars in them.2Lan Yu looked elegant and refined standing there, just like a pure and holy fairy.\u201cYou look very good, young lady.\u201d Lil Bing gave a sincere compliment.Chu Kuangren nodded with satisfaction as well.\u201cNot bad, but where are your wings?\u201dHe noticed that Lan Yu\u2019s wings had disappeared.\u201cYoung Master doesn\u2019t seem to want me to attract too much attention, so I kept them away. You can see them any time you wish to, Young Master.\u201d3As Lan Yu spoke, her wings appeared again on her back between her shoulder blades.2\u201cThat\u2019s rather convenient. Alright, put them away.\u201d\u201cYes, Young Master.\u201dLil Bing clicked her tongue in wonder beside him.She never thought that this young lady actually had an ability like this.1In the next few days, Chu Kuangren spent all his time cultivating in the Daoist Palace.2In this period of time, the prizes he drew every day declined as well. However, he didn\u2019t know whether it was because a god somewhere was frowning at him or something, because all he pulled were Iron grade items. He immediately threw all of them into the Yin and Yang Ring.3In the Towering Heaven Daoist Palace.Chu Kuangren sat cross-legged on the bed in his room. Streams of incomparably sharp purple light that had an incomparably sharp feeling circulated on the surface of his body.This was the formation of sword qi from cultivating the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art!The Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art was split into nine stages.They corresponded to the nine cultivation realms leading all the way up until the Sage Manifestation Realm respectively.In two days, Chu Kuangren already cultivated said technique to the peak of the second stage which was also the peak of the Foundation Establishment Realm. He was only half a step away from the Golden Core realm too.One had to know that he was only at the Qi Refinement Realm before this.However, he jumped one large realm and several small realms in just two days.If anyone ever got wind of a cultivation speed like this, it would probably frighten them to death.One of the reasons was because he had a Supreme Daoist Physique, but the contributions of the Spirit Gathering Array and the cultivation resources the Black Heaven Sect provided couldn\u2019t go unnoticed either.\u201cIf this keeps up, I can reach the Golden Core Realm in less than ten days. Most of the True Disciples are also at this stage too,\u201d Chu Kuangren muttered.At this moment, the voice transmission compass at his waist vibrated.\u201cYoung Master, True Disciple Li Yao has come to pay you a visit.\u201dLil Bing\u2019s voice came from the compass.\u201cOh, Li Yao?\u201dChu Kuangren slightly raised his eyebrows.He was very familiar with this name; it was that True Disciple who wanted to keep the original owner of this body as her handsome male companion.\u201cLet\u2019s go and take a look then.\u201d\u2026\u2026Outside Towering Heaven Palace.Many disciples were crowding around a woman dressed in a gorgeous robe while carrying a large bundle of thorns on her back.1\u201cHey, look at that. That\u2019s the True Disciple Li Yao. She\u2019s carrying a bramble on her back and asking for punishment. Tsk, did something happen between this Li Yao and Chu Kuangren?\u201d\u201cYou still don\u2019t know?\u201d\u201cLi Yao is a coquettish woman by nature and has heaps of attractive young men in her palace. She fancied Chu Kuangren in the past, but he rejected her. As a result, she flew into a fit of anger out of humiliation and thrashed him so badly that he sustained serious injuries.\u201d\u201cSo that\u2019s what happened. The tides of fate really have changed. Who would\u2019ve thought that Chu Kuangren would\u2019ve awakened with a Supreme Daoist Physique? Li Yao got scared and intentionally came to offer her humble apologies. She really can set her status aside too.\u201d\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming out\u2026\u201d4Chu Kuangren slowly walked out from Towering Heaven Daoist Palace with a refined aura. He was dressed in a white wide-sleeved robe with the image of a qilin on it and wore a jade hat on his head.4He immediately attracted the attention of everyone around him when he appeared on the scene.1\u201cH-how handsome!\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be, someone this handsome actually exists in this world?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the new Lead Martial Brother?\u201d1\u201cOh my, I think I\u2019m in love.\u201dLi Yao, who was offering her humble apology, raised her head and saw Chu Kuangren. She initially held a trace of resentment for Chu Kuangren in her heart.Since a Supreme Daoist Physique suddenly awakened within Chu Kuangren, she had no other choice but to come forth and apologize. If she didn\u2019t do so, she would have a hard time in the future.However, when she saw Chu Kuangren, the hint of resentment in her heart disappeared in a flash. She really was too captivated by the other party\u2019s appearance.\u201cHe was handsome in the past, but he actually looks even better now that he\u2019s a Lead Martial Brother. My god, I really can\u2019t control myself.\u201dLi Yao was deep in infatuation as she looked at Chu Kuangren.She even ignored the scorching pain on her back.Chu Kuangren saw Li Yao beneath the stairs as soon as he walked out of the Daoist Palace. He couldn\u2019t help but feel slightly baffled when he saw her carrying a bramble and asking for punishment.\u201cLi Yao has offended Martial Brother, so I\u2019ve come forth to offer you my humble apology.\u201d1Li Yao knelt on the ground right away. She held up a long whip in her hands and sincerely said, \u201cIf you want to kill me or cut off my flesh as punishment, you may do so as you please, Martial Brother!\u201dChu Kuangren was even more stupefied in his heart.What was going on?Based on the ordinary sequence of events, shouldn\u2019t he be the one to avenge himself? Wasn\u2019t he the one who would defeat this Li Yao after going through painstaking lengths to cultivate and to trample her beneath his feet?4Why did the other party come looking for trouble herself now?1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 6": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe corner of Chu Kuangren\u2019s lips twitched as he looked at that long whip and the expression Li Yao had on her face that said \u2018Senior Martial Brother, hurry up and whip me\u2019.3Was it possible that this Li Yao had masochistic tendencies?8Truthfully speaking, the original owner of this body held resentment toward Li Yao in his heart. After all, he was bedridden for two days since the other party had seriously injured him.Chu Kuangren had transmigrated and the original owner\u2019s memories, so it made sense that he would not have a good impression of Li Yao.However, he wasn\u2019t the original Chu Kuangren in the end, so his hatred toward Li Yao wasn\u2019t as strong as it previously was.Chu Kuangren muttered irresolutely to himself for a moment before he raised his palm. He circulated his spirit energy and brought it down. This palm contained the overbearing sword qi unique to the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art. Its might was enough to cut a mountain and split the earth apart.Bang!This palm struck Li Yao right in her chest.2Li Yao did not dodge nor hide.\u201cI took a blow from your palm in the past, and you took one from me today. Let us forget about our past resentments from now on. You can go now.\u201dHe didn\u2019t hold back in the slightest when he attacked with his palm just now. He knew that at least four or five of her bones were broken from Li Yao\u2019s caved in chest.Fortunately, Li Yao wasn\u2019t weak either; she was at the Golden Core Realm. If that weren\u2019t the case, it wasn\u2019t impossible for her to die on the spot from the force.Chu Kuangren thought that dealing with the matter this way should be good enough. Not only did he avenge the original owner of the body, but he also reflected the magnanimous side of him.\u201cThank you for sparing my life, Martial Brother!\u201dLi Yao barely propped herself up. She knelt on the ground and kowtowed at him before she staggered away.\u201dYoung Master, your benevolence is exceptional,\u201d said Little Bing who was standing beside him.She also heard about what Li Yao did to Chu Kuangren. Even if Chu Kuangren killed Li Yao on the spot, she wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201cThis is benevolence?\u201dChu Kuangren shook his head as he found this ridiculous.It seemed like this world was already accustomed to something like killing people, so he, too, had to get used to it in the future.5Thankfully, he retained the memories of the person who originally owned this body so it would not be too difficult.The matter with Li Yao was only a brief interlude.Chu Kuangren continued immersing himself fully in his cultivation. One day, he actually heard that Li Yao released all of the handsome male companions she had collected.It was as though her nature had completely changed after the beating he gave her with his palm.4Chu Kuangren never took this matter to heart.A few days later.A pillar of sword qi suddenly shot up into the air from Towering Heaven Daoist Palace.The swords within a 50-kilometer radius of the Daoist Palace buzzed simultaneously!The abrupt occurrence of this anomaly startled many people.\u201cIt\u2019s another anomaly!\u201d\u201cThe aura is coming from Towering Heaven Daoist Palace, it\u2019s Chu Kuangren.\u201d\u201cEven if he has a Supreme Daoist Physique, this is too frightening, isn\u2019t it? There\u2019s been one strange occurrence practically every day! Is he even going to let people cultivate?\u201d2Inside Longevity Hall located in Black Heaven Sect.Honorable Xuan Qi abruptly opened his eyes. \u201cThis is a Golden Core aura. He actually broke through to the Golden Core Realm so quickly?\u201d said Honorable Xuan Qi in a suspicious and doubtful tone..Even if he had a Supreme Daoist Physique, this was too quick.The strange occurrences left as fast as they came.Chu Kuangren restrained his aura in the Daoist Palace. A stream of purple light flitted across his pupils as he slowly opened his eyes.\u201cI finally broke through to the Golden Core Realm,\u201d Chu Kuangren muttered..He successfully went from being an ordinary martial artist at the Qi Refinement Realm to successfully making a breakthrough to the Golden Core Realm in less than ten days. This kind of advancement in realms was almost outrageous.\u201cKuangren, come and see me.\u201dAt this moment, a voice rang in Chu Kuangren\u2019s ears.It was Honorable Xuan Qi.Chu Kuangren tidied himself up and went to Longevity Hall.\u201cKuangren, you broke through to the Golden Core Realm already?\u201d asked Honorable Xuan Qi as soon as they met each other.\u201cYes, Master.\u201dAt first, Honorable Xuan Qi was only guessing. However, he couldn\u2019t help but reveal a hint of shock in his eyes after he heard it right from Chu Kuangren\u2019s mouth.He had really broken through to the Golden Core Realm!The speed at which he achieved this was too fast.When he thought about it, he was an outstanding cultivation genius in the world himself, yet it took him close to two years to break through from the Qi Refinement Realm to the Golden Core Realm.Chu Kuangren had done it in less than ten days!This cultivation speed was simply terrifying!\u201cMaster, are you alright?\u201d asked Chu Kuangren when he saw the dumbfounded look on Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s face.\u201cCough, cough.\u201d Honorable Xuan Qi came back to his senses and said, \u201cThat\u2019s not bad, but you should avoid being arrogant and impatient by all means. Cultivation is like a boat going against the current; you will decline if you don\u2019t move forward. Your realm will advance at lightning speed in the early stages, but there are plenty of cultivators who can\u2019t advance a single step forward in the later stages. Rather than being fast, building a good foundation is of the utmost importance.\u201d\u201cYour disciple understands.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded.He had a Supreme Daoist Physique and was cultivating a Saint Technique as well. Even if he did not deliberately develop his foundation, he would have the finest one amongst those in the same realm.2\u201cSince you\u2019ve already broken through to the Golden Core Realm, head to Sword Mountain and find yourself a sword. You have the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, so they will easily acknowledge you as their master even if they are sacred weapons. That\u2019s fine, as long as you don\u2019t move Sword Mountain away,\u201d Honorable Xuan Qi chuckled and said.\u201cYes.\u201dAfter that, Honorable Xuan Qi gave Chu Kuangren the directions to Sword Mountain.Before returning to his Daoist Palace, Chu Kuangren listened to Honorable Xuan Qi and went to Sword Mountain as he planned to find a weapon that was suitable for him.Sword Mountain was a valuable treasure of the Black Heaven Sect that was close to the level of Emperor Weapons. Countless precious and famous swords, and even sacred weapons, were kept on it.He could feel sword qi pressuring him just by getting close to it.Chu Kuangren arrived at the foot of Sword Mountain.Even before he officially stepped inside, Sword Mountain trembled for him as though it was welcoming his arrival.Many disciples clicked their tongues in wonder at this strange occurrence and there was no end to their envy.\u201cSword Mountain has moved several times in over ten thousand years, but it has moved abnormally several times in a row now because of this Chu Kuangren. As expected of someone with a Supreme Daoist Physique.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s Chu Kuangren, the one who was newly promoted to the position of Lead Disciple. Sure enough, he really is exceptional. Look at his face and aura, he really is a dragon amongst humans.\u201d\u201cThe speed of his advancement in rank from outer sect disciple straight to Lead Martial Brother is outrageous.\u00a0Reaching heaven in a single bound is nothing more than this too.\u201d\u201cF*ck, there\u2019s actually someone who\u2019s even more handsome than I am in this world?\u201d8Chu Kuangren resembled the most dazzling moon in the darkest of nights. No matter where he went, he grabbed the most attention.\u201cSigh, I was exceedingly handsome even beforehand. With this Banished Immortal Aura added on to that, I reckon I won\u2019t be able to have peace wherever I go in the future.\u201d9Chu Kuangren shook his head.This was even more tiring than being a celebrity like the heavenly idol and so on from his previous life.1Chu Kuangren ignored the disciples along the way as he headed straight for the peak of Sword\u00a0Mountain. The closer he got to the peak, the higher the ranks of the swords.All kinds of swords appeared before his eyes.Epees, thin swords, broadswords, dual swords, flexible swords\u2026There were gorgeous ones or simple ones, and even strangely shaped ones\u20264Chu Kuangren was dazzled looking at the swords.Not only that, but he seemed to be able to sense the emotions of these swords. It was a kind of mysterious feeling that was difficult to put into words.Every sword here was telling him that they wanted to get close to him.\u201cThis Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart really is impressive. This ability to get close to all of the swords in the world alone is enough to make countless sword cultivators yearn for it even in their dreams,\u201d Chu Kuangren couldn\u2019t help but say with some deep emotion.Some swordsmen sought to attain the realm of fusion with a sword. This required extreme agreement and compatibility between the owner and the sword.Chu Kuangren could have all the swords get close to him naturally. Fusing with a sword was like eating and drinking to him; it was too simple.There were nine swords sunk in the limestone at the peak of Sword Mountain.Every sword was exuding sword intent that was incomparably cold to the bone.These nine swords were part of the Ten Great Sacred Swords in Black Heaven Sect. As for the tenth one, it was in the hands of Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Daoist Nan Gonghuang.3Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 7": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 7Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThere was a large slab of limestone pierced with nine sacred swords on the peak of Sword Mountain.Piercingly cold sword intent spanned across a 100 foot radius around them.In the perimeter stood only the nine swords. All the other swords were unable to enter this region as though there was a domain that prevented them from entering.A young man with sharp eyebrows and starry eyes was currently staring at the nine sacred swords 1000 feet away from them. There was a fiery glint in his eyes which bore a longing that he found difficult to keep in check.\u201cI\u2019ve already broken through to the perfect Nascent Soul Realm now, so I will definitely get the sacred swords\u2019 acknowledgment today! I will prove that I, Murong Xuan, am not beneath Nan Gonghuang!\u201d5Murong Xuan was proud of his success and he looked determined to win.He took one step into the perimeter shrouded in the sacred swords\u2019 intent. In an instant, the surrounding sword intent ferociously pushed down on his body!The sacred swords used their sword intent as a test.Murong Xuan made preparations early on to face the pressuring might of the sword intent. Spirit energy surged out from the spirit ruins in his body and surrounded his entire body, blocking the sword intent.He took one step at a time\u2026Murong Xuan approached the sacred swords with firm footsteps!The pressuring might of the sword intent was even more tyrannical and terrifying the closer he got!When Murong Xuan was 500 feet away from the sacred swords, there was a thin layer of sweat seeping out of his forehead. He felt as though a large mountain was pressing down on him and every step he took was abnormally difficult.A few people comprising four men and two women were paying attention to Murong Xuan high up in the sky.Every single one of them was dressed in gorgeous black robes. If a disciple from Black Heaven Sect saw them, they would definitely recognize that these few people were Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Daoists!Daoists were the most outstanding disciples in a cultivation orthodoxy!That was especially the case for Black Heaven Sect with its long-standing traditions passed down through the years. Every single one of the Daoists from a Sage orthodoxy that had produced Sages in the past were the best peerless proud sons of the heavens in the world.One could even call them sons of qilin too.\u201cTake a guess, do you guys think Murong Xuan will be able to obtain the acknowledgment of the sacred swords this time?\u201d asked a Daoist with a ruminating smile.\u201cHe\u2019s already failed close to ten times now, I reckon there will be enough suspense this time too,\u201d said another Daoist apathetically.\u201cThat\u2019s not necessarily the case. I heard that Murong Xuan already broke through to the\u00a0perfect Nascent Soul Realm, so he might be able to succeed this time, no?\u201d\u201cThere certainly is that possibility.\u201d\u201cIf he succeeds, Nangong Huang will have another rival.\u201dThe group discussed spiritedly.Murong Xuan suddenly let out a long shout beneath them.\u201cHeavenly Sun Sword Art!\u201dA large amount of spirit energy spurted out from Murong Xuan\u2019s body.Blazing sword qi exploded and turned into rings of fire. The rings of fire circled around him and contended against the sword intent of the sacred sword.The pressure on Murong Xuan greatly decreased once he lightened his body.\u201cThe Supreme Technique, Heavenly Sun Sword Art!\u201d\u201cHah, his influence is much stronger than before. He truly has broken through to the perfect Nascent Soul Realm, so he might really be able to get a sacred sword this time.\u201dThe Daoists in the sky clicked their tongues in wonder.Other than the Three Great Sage Techniques, there were still a few Supreme Techniques in Sacred Black Heaven Land. Only True Disciples and Daoists could cultivate these techniques.400 feet\u2026 300 feet\u2026 200 feet\u2026100 feet!He was only 100 feet away from the sacred swords!Murong Xuan\u2019s eyes were rigidly fixed on a crimson sacred sword. That was the Sacred Sword, Crimson Drill, the goal of this journey!The most suitable sacred sword for him was the Crimson Drill.It exuded an air of masculinity and strength, tyrannical beyond compare!2It also complemented his Crimson Sun Daoist Physique, so it could definitely increase his combat abilities by more than twofold. When the time came, he would not fear the nine great Daoists of Black Heaven Sect except for Nangong Huang. Aside from a very few evildoers, he could even walk freely wherever he pleased amongst the youths in Azure Dragon Domain.The pressure from the sword intent was even more frightening 100 feet away from the sacred swords.Even a Nascent Soul cultivator possibly couldn\u2019t bear it either.However, Murong Xuan wasn\u2019t an ordinary Nascent Soul cultivator. He was a peerless son of the heavens and had the rare Crimson Sun Daoist Physique. He even cultivated a Sage Technique!1His foundation and combat abilities surpassed cultivators who were in the same realm!\u201cDivine Nine Suns Art!!!\u201dMurong Xuan summoned the spirit energy in his body to the extreme.Four balls of spirit energy could be seen floating behind him now. They turned into four dazzling and ardent suns and whistled with a heatwave that was frightening beyond compare!!!This was one of Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Three Greatest Sage Techniques, Divine Nine Suns Art!The expressions on the Daoists\u2019 faces changed slightly.\u201cDivine Nine Suns Art with four suns in the same sky would mean that he\u2019s at the fourth stage. Looking at this power, I reckon he\u2019s about to break through to the fifth stage soon too.\u201d\u201cTsk, Murong Xuan has a Crimson Sun Daoist Physique so he is much faster than the rest of the cultivators who are cultivating this Divine Nine Suns Art and much stronger as well. If he can get Crimson Drill, I reckon he can compete with Nan Gonghuang!\u201dAt this moment, Murong Xuan who was utilizing the Divine Nine Suns Art was closing the final 100 feet, 90, 80, 70, 60\u20261He finally arrived in front of the Crimson Drill Sword in the end.It was several times more exhausting for him to travel across this short distance of 100 feet than it was before. However, the smile on his face didn\u2019t diminish as he looked at Crimson Drill before him with a fiery look in his eyes. \u201cSacred Sword Crimson Drill, acknowledge your allegiance to me!!!\u201dHe bravely reached out and grabbed Crimson Drill\u2019s hilt.Buzz, buzz, buzz!Crimson Drill Sword started trembling and sword qi began flowing out.Murong Xuan had anticipated this beforehand. All of the spirit energy in his body surged out to suppress the sword qi and the four ardent suns behind him became even more dazzling.This was the final stage.\u201cCrimson Drill, I have the Crimson Sun Daoist Physique and cultivate the Divine Nine Suns Art. Our attributes are compatible so I am best suited to be your owner! Why should you resist?\u201d3\u201cYour name will become legendary if you acknowledge me as your master!\u201d1\u201cIt\u2019s not impossible for you to be reborn and become an Emperor Weapon when I conquer the imperial throne one day! So, yield to me!!!\u201dMurong Xuan was suppressing the sword qi as he patiently persuaded Crimson Drill. Sacred weapons had souls, so he hoped he could use this to gain its acknowledgment.It was as though Crimson Drill had been persuaded as well because its sword qi gradually dwindled away.Upon seeing this, Murong Xuan was delighted and he pulled out Crimson Drill in a burst of energy.\u201cHaha, Crimson Drill, you won\u2019t regret it!\u201dIn the blink of an eye.The power Murong Xuan exuded resembled a rainbow once he resonated with the sword!All of the Daoists watching were alarmed.\u201cHe\u2019s actually succeeded!!!\u201d\u201cAnother Daoist has obtained the acknowledgment of a sacred sword after Nan Gonghuang!\u201d\u201cHuh, someone is coming.\u201dAll of a sudden, something seemed to grab the Daoists\u2019 attention and they turned to look somewhere not too far into the distance. The only thing they saw was a person slowly walking toward the sacred swords from hundreds of feet away.1That person was wearing a white wide-sleeved qilin robe with a jade hat on his head and a refined aura around him. All of the swords would buzz and vibrate slightly wherever he went.5It was as though the swords were respectfully welcoming their king! Their god!\u201cWho is this person? It\u2019s as though every movement of his contains some kind of Daoist charm and he even looks like a deity walking the Earth. He\u2019s too outstanding.\u201d\u201cWhat is going on with those swords? Why do I have a feeling that they are welcoming this person? This is rather inconceivable, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard of this person before, he\u2019s the newly promoted Lead Disciple.\u201d\u201cLead? Then wouldn\u2019t he be our Senior Martial Brother?\u201dThe few Daoists looked at each other in dismay before their gazes were fixed on the person who had arrived.On the other hand, Murong Xuan\u2019s entire face was plastered with excitement as he held Crimson Drill.He had only obtained the temporary right to use a sacred weapon since Crimson Drill hadn\u2019t completely acknowledged him as its owner. However, he would definitely be able to utilize Crimson Drill to its full extent as long he properly nurtured himself and his cultivation gradually progressed!2Just as Murong Xuan was fantasizing about how he would use the Crimson Drill in his hands to destroy everyone in his path in the future, it suddenly started trembling again.No, not only Crimson Drill.The other sacred swords were trembling all at once too.It was as though they were excited and respectfully welcoming someone!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d13Murong Xuan\u2019s eyebrows knitted slightly. This was the first time he had encountered a situation like this. He turned around as he sensed something and looked at Chu Kuangren, who was currently walking over slowly. When he saw that it was him, there was unavoidably a look of amazement in his eyes too.\u201cThis person\u2026 is really handsome!\u201d12Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 8": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 8Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u201cIs he a disciple who came here to choose a sword?\u201d Murong Xuan murmured as he looked at Chu Kuangren.For some unknown reason, he had a feeling that this person was the reason behind the strange movements from the sacred swords.Add the other party\u2019s extraordinarily refined aura on top of that and he could not help but glance at the other party another time with a hint of dignity and curiosity in his eyes.1Chu Kuangren was already within the sacred swords\u2019 domain and the sword intent was enveloping him.However, what was fascinating was that this sword intent did not faze him in the slightest. On the contrary, it was similar to spring winds gently brushing against his face.Chu Kuangren approached the sacred swords one step at a time.Soon, he was close to his destination.Murong Xuan couldn\u2019t help but stare with his eyes wide open as he held Crimson Drill.What was going on?It was incredulously exhausting for him to cross that domain of sword intent, but the person before his eyes was doing it so effortlessly as though he was taking a leisurely stroll. The disparity between them was far too great!Murong Xuan looked at the other sacred swords left.He realized that the vibration of these sacred swords had intensified.They showed signs of excitement as if they had human emotionsF*ck!1Were these swords deliberately making it easy for him!?This absurd thought suddenly popped up in Murong Xuan\u2019s mind.The sacred swords had been on Sword Mountain for so many years and the cultivators who came here wanting to obtain their acknowledgment were too many to count. However, he had never seen the sacred swords weaken the pressure of their sword intent in the slightest. They treated all cultivators equally.Yet they were paving the way for Chu Kuangren!\u201cThis can\u2019t be right, can it?\u201dMurong Xuan swallowed his saliva as feelings of incredulity rose within him.The other Daoists in the area were also dumbstruck.\u201cI heard this person has an Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, a Supreme Daoist Physique. When he awakened, all of the swords on Sword Mountain went to kowtow to him. I didn\u2019t believe this rumor at first but it looks like it\u2019s very possible that it\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cF*ck, how is the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart this overpowered?\u201d\u201cSupreme Daoist Physiques are freaking awesome.\u201d\u2026\u2026Chu Kuangren crossed the sword intent region that spanned 1000 feet with ease. He glanced at Murong Xuan first, slightly narrowing his eyes.To be fair, he did have several small suns above his head.He gave the other party a slight nod, \u201cHello, Younger Martial Brother.\u201dY-younger Martial Brother???Murong Xuan was a little stunned for words.He was a magnificent Daoist and was second in ranking only to the Elder and Sect Master in Black Heaven Sect. No one had ever called him Younger Martial Brother before.\u201cDo you know who I am?\u201dThe expression on Murong Xuan\u2019s expression darkened slightly.\u201cI do, Daoist Murong Xuan.\u201dChu Kuangren nodded. He had seen him several times before, but Murong Xuan had not taken notice of an outer sect disciple like him at that time.\u201cThen how dare you address me like that?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s because I\u2019m the new Lead Disciple, Chu Kuangren. You should be calling me Senior Martial Brother. \u201d Chu Kuangren said indifferently.After that, he looked at the few sacred swords stuck in the limestone.It seemed as though they had sensed Chu Kuangren\u2019s gaze. The sacred swords flew away from the limestone on their own and arrived by his side.Even the Crimson Drill Sword, which Murong Xuan had obtained with much difficulty, trembled for a moment. It struggled free of Murong Xuan\u2019s hand and flew toward Chu Kuangren.2The nine sacred swords hovered around Chu Kuangren and blossomed with resplendent sword light. It was an incredibly magnificent sight as streams of runes flowed one after the other.\u201cHow is that even possible?!\u201dThere was a look of sheer disbelief on Murong Xuan\u2019s face.He made this sacred sword yield to him with much difficulty. He only held it for a short time before it could get warm, yet it eagerly ran over to curry up someone else?1That\u2019s right, the feeling these sacred swords gave Murong Xuan was that they were sucking up to and hoping to gain Chu Kuangren\u2019s attention.If these sacred swords could speak\u2026They would definitely be chanting \u2018pick me\u2019 and \u2018please please pick me\u2019 right now.2The Daoists in the sky looked astonished as well.\u201cThis is completely unbelievable.\u201d\u201cAre these the sacred swords we know?\u201d\u201cF*ck, are sacred swords materialistic too?\u201d6Based on what they were aware of, sacred swords were inviolable and untouchable. They gave everyone the cold shoulder, even if it was the Sect Master of Black Heaven Sect. However, all of them surrounded Chu Kuangren now as though they were peacocks seeking their mate; they were flaunting their beauty and brilliance with all their might\u20262Murong Xuan had a puzzled look on his face, but he was evidently dissatisfied.F*ck, he was extraordinarily handsome!He went through painstaking efforts to cultivate and only managed to move the sacred sword, Crimson Drill with much difficulty. Yet when it saw Chu Kuangren now, it ran over to him in the blink of an eye to court his favor.1It was as though all of his hard work was a joke.Someone easily obtained something he worked hard to pursue.When he thought about this, Murong Xuan\u2019s Daoist heart was almost led to apostasy.He was not the only one, the other Daoists in the air didn\u2019t feel any better either.However, Chu Kuangren wasn\u2019t planning to take care of how the other Daoists felt at this moment. He looked at the nine swords and had a somewhat confused look on his face.1\u2018Which one should I choose?\u2019\u2018All of them?\u2019That was a joke, his Master would beat him to death if he did so.In any case, he was not that greedy either.Chu Kuangren was at a loss.Little did he know that the look of confusion on his face was another attack to the Daoists in their eyes.These were sacred swords! Most of the cultivators in the world might have never even seen them before, yet this man was spoilt for choice?\u201cTruly, comparison just pisses people off.\u201dAt a loss for words or actions, the Daoist could only laugh to himself.A while later.Chu Kuangren placed his gaze on a sacred sword that was clothed entirely in white light. It was sparkling and translucent with intricate decorative designs carved on it.The white sacred sword got even more excited as though it sensed that Chu Kuangren was looking at it. Countless runes manifested themselves and brilliant light was circulating around its body.The other sacred swords kept releasing their sword intent as though they were getting anxious.They even wanted to join forces to suppress the white-jade-like sacred sword.It was as though they wanted to use this opportunity to display how powerful they were.1However, Chu Kuangren\u2019s gaze still lingered on that white sacred sword. He reached out and resonated with that white sacred sword. \u201cCome.\u201dWhoosh\u2026The white sacred sword flew into Chu Kuangren\u2019s palm in an instant. It put its own sword intent away meekly like an obedient child as it feared it would harm Chu Kuangren in the slightest.Chu Kuangren gently caressed the blade of the white sacred sword with his finger. Its blade was incomparably gentle, just as though it was carved out of white jade.This was a gorgeous sword; it was so magnificent it could pass off as a sacred ornament.However, Chu Kuangren could sense the boundlessly sharp sword intent contained within this sword. It was as though its power could rip the earth itself apart.1Two tiny words were carved at the edge of the blade.\u201cDescendant Self\u2026\u201d Chu Kuangren read them out and the Sacred Sword, Descendant Self vibrated twice too as though it was responding to him.Chu Kuangren smiled. \u201cYou\u2019re the one.\u201dOnce he said those words, the remaining sacred swords released a constant stream of sword intent as though they wanted to make Chu Kuangren change his mind.However, Chu Kuangren had already settled on Descendant Self. These few sacred swords were almost the same in terms of power but Descendant Self was the most attractive one. Which one would he choose if not for the one he was currently holding?\u201cAlright, I\u2019m heading back!\u201dChu Kuangren looked at the other sacred swords and waved his hand at them.The other sacred swords were helpless even if they were unwilling to accept their fate, seeing as he had already made up his mind. As such, they had no other choice but to sulk as they went back into the limestone.1On the other hand, Crimson Drill returned to Murong Xuan\u2019s hands once more.7At this moment, though, Murong Xuan did not seem too happy.He felt that he was picking up another man\u2019s trash.2Crimson Drill was only his to have since Chu Kuangren didn\u2019t want it.This kind of feeling made him feel extremely unpleasant and he was very sullen.\u201cYou\u2019re the new Lead Disciple, Chu Kuangren,\u201d said Murong Xuan as he gripped Crimson Drill tightly.\u201cYes, that\u2019s me.\u201d\u201cVery well, I heard the new Lead Disciple has a Supreme Daoist Physique. Allow me to learn from your prowess!\u201d Murong Xuan said insipidly.The words formed a stifling in his heart. He found it unbearable if he did not let it out, but he also wanted to see what power Chu Kuangren had.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 9": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 9Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThis was\u2026 A challenge?!Chu Kuangren looked at Murong Xuan. There were mysterious runes flashing through the depths of his pupils as he activated the Remarkable Eye of Revelation.\u201cMurong Xuan, Crimson Sun Daoist Physique. Cultivation level, perfect Nascent Soul Realm. He cultivates the Sage Technique, Divine Nine Suns Art and the Supreme Technique, Heavenly Sun Sword Art\u2026\u201dA string of information flashed across Chu Kuangren\u2019s field of sight.The Crimson Sun Daoist Physique was also one of the 3,000 constitutions.It couldn\u2019t compete with a Supreme Daoist Physique like the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, but it was still impressive in its own right. In any orthodoxy, those with this physique would be prodigies.He even cultivated a Sage and Supreme Technique\u2026Murong Xuan\u2019s combat abilities definitely surpassed other cultivators who were in the same realm.\u201cHeh, I am merely at the Golden Core Realm now, but you have reached the perfect Nascent Soul Realm. Do you feel no shame challenging me like this? Do you not want to save face?\u201d Chu Kuangren said with a smile.\u201cYou know what my cultivation level is?\u201dMurong Xuan was a little startled.However, he did not pay the fact much attention. Some people knew that he had broken through to the perfect Nascent Soul Realm although news of it had yet to spread.Thus, it was impossible for Chu Kuangren to have heard it from someone.\u201cIf you\u2019re afraid, I can suppress my cultivation to fight you.\u201d\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for that.\u201d Chu Kuangren shook his head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid you\u2019ll lose really badly when the time comes, so it\u2019s best if you give it your all.\u201d\u201cHumph, such arrogance!\u201d Murong Xuan coldly snorted and placed Crimson Drill to one side.He had yet to nurture this sword, and based on the attitude this sword had toward Chu Kuangren just now, he reckoned it would not help him in defeating the other party.There was slight dissatisfaction in heart at not being able to use the sword that he had obtained through so much difficulty.\u201cHeavenly Sun Sword Art!\u201dMurong Xuan transferred the spirit energy from the spirit ruins in his body to his finger which he used in place of a sword.His sword finger slashed downward and a large amount of spirit energy violently surged out. It condensed into a massive ring of fire and shot forward.Waves of scorching air tumbled and turned. The power of the attack seemed like it could set the world on fire.Chu Kuangren could tell that the might of his attacker\u2019s move was below the level of the Nascent Soul Realm. Evidently, he was consciously suppressing his cultivation.However, the strength of this attack wasn\u2019t one that ordinary Golden Core cultivators could withstand either.Thankfully, Chu Kuangren wasn\u2019t an ordinary cultivator!He didn\u2019t use the sacred sword, Descendant Self, but rather he similarly used his finger in place of a sword.\u201cOne Thousand Sharp Swords Art!\u201dStreams of purple sword qi exuding an overbearing auras appeared.A terrifying shockwave of air exploded when the two forces collided and shot back toward the duo, but neither moved an inch.\u201cOne Thousand Sharp Swords Art? Is this the top-tier outer sect technique?\u201dMurong Xuan looked somewhat bewildered and unsure.The cultivation techniques in the world were divided into three tiers; lower, middle, and top respectively. The Supreme, Sage, and Emperor\u2019s Scripture Techniques were above those three basic levels.His Heavenly Sun Sword Art was a Supreme Technique, yet Chu Kuangren could actually fight neck and neck with him using the One Thousand Sharp Swords Art which was only a top-tier technique!!!\u201cThat\u2019s right, this is certainly the One Thousand Sharp Swords Art,\u201d Chu Kuangren calmly said.The Daoists in the sky were awestruck at this.\u201cA top-tier technique can go head to head with a Supreme Technique? My eyes aren\u2019t playing tricks on me, right? Is this really the One Thousand Sharp Swords Art?\u201d\u201cIt is, he already cultivated it to its perfected state.\u201d\u201cEven so, it\u2019s a little terrifying how it can contend with the Heavenly Sun Sword Art. C-could it be due to the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart?!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right. Rumour has it that the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart can easily master a myriad of sword techniques in the world and unleash formidable power far beyond its original means. It appears that this rumor is true.\u201d4A top-tier technique and a Supreme Technique were equal in terms of power. What\u2019s more, the users were a Golden Core and Nascent Soul cultivator respectively. No one would believe it if such news got out.However, this was really happening right before their eyes today.The Daoists in the sky were overwhelmed with emotions. In their minds, they began to understand why the higher-ups would make Chu Kuangren a Lead Disciple.\u201cAgain!!!\u201d Murong Xuan raised his eyebrows. He wasn\u2019t willing to accept defeat so he continued summoning his spirit energy and sliced rings of fire at Chu Kuangren one after the other.Chu Kuangren stood motionlessly and acted calmly all the way through. In between the gestures he made, the purple sword qi around him spiraled and hacked away all the rings of fire flying at him.Even if Chu Kuangren was only at the Golden Core Realm, he possessed incomparably strong combat abilities and was even close to the Nascent Soul realm. This was because of the tyrannical sword qi unique to the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art paired with the support of the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart on top of that.Chu Kuangren hacked a ring of fire effortlessly before he shook his head and said, \u201cUse all of your power, you aren\u2019t a match for me like this.\u201dBoom!!!Just as he finished speaking, the spirit energy on Murong Xuan\u2019s body rose sharply. Crimson flames violently surged and intertwined in the void to form a blazing crimson sun that was gradually rising into the air. The scorching heat made one feel as though their bodies were in a furnace.\u201cOh, a transformation, a transformation of a Daoist Physique.\u201dChu Kuangren was enthralled as he watched the scene before his eyes.A transformation was one technique amongst the myriad of techniques. The cultivators who could successfully cultivate a transformation were mostly those who had outstanding aptitude. There was another breed of people who possessed unique transformations by nature and they were cultivators with Daoist Physiques!Murong Xuan had the Crimson Sun Daoist Physique.This Blazing Crimson Sun was his Crimson Sun Transformation.Murong Xuan\u2019s power rose sharply once he used his Daoist Physique Transformation. When he used the Heavenly Sun Sword Art again, its power was no longer the same as it was before.The ring of fire that was originally yellow in color was stained with a bright red layer.It was a level higher, both in temperature and the formidability of its power. The ground would crack wherever the ring of fire went and the earth was charred black.\u201cRight on time, try this move on for size!\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s black hair danced in the breeze as he stood where he was and his white wide-sleeved robes fluttered in the wind. Shortly after that, a peerlessly frightening aura exploded from his body. The aura of a Daoist circulated around him as though a deity was quietly coming back to life.The pupils of the Daoists in the audience abruptly contracted.They actually felt some kind of menacing force coming from Chu Kuangren!One had to know that the other party was only at the Golden Core Realm, whereas not a single one of them wasn\u2019t a Nascent Soul cultivator!They stared unblinkingly at Chu Kuangren.The other party sucked in a deep breath and a mysterious yellow flow of air all around the region converged toward him, manifesting in the form of a vast aura.\u201cThat\u2019s earth qi!!!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s actually invoking earth qi!\u201dThe Daoists in the sky were taken aback.The spirit energy of the world was also divided based on their attributes like fire, ice, wind, and so forth. Earth qi was also one kind of spirit energy and existed within mountains, rivers, and leylines. It was boundless, but extremely difficult for cultivators to mobilize and use.Chu Kuangren was actually mobilizing earth qi now!\u201cWhat technique is he cultivating?!\u201d one Daoist cried out in alarm as he looked utterly shocked.Chu Kuangren made a mysterious hand sign and the earth qi condensed into a divine mountain. Just as the ring of fire was about to plunder over him, he pushed both his hands out.1\u201cHuman Mountain Stamp!\u201d9The immemorial divine mountain made of earth qi trembled loudly and unleashed a frightening power that was beyond comparison; it was as though it could push everything away, even the earth itself.The crimson ring of fire was smashed into a file of sparks instantly amidst the loud rumbling.The divine mountain was like a hot knife cutting through butter as it closed right in on Murong Xuan!The Crimson Sun Transformation exploded on with a bang. On the other hand, Murong Xuan spat out blood immediately and was sent flying back more than 1000 feet.The Daoists were dumbfounded.By contrast, Chu Kuangren stood with his hands behind his back and held a calm gaze.This scene didn\u2019t take him by surprise.The Human Mountain Stamp was a Starlight grade technique, and when converted into Firmament Star\u2019s grading of techniques, it was close to that of an Emperor\u2019s Scripture technique.There were also various grades and rankings within Sage Techniques. The Human Mountain Stamp was a peak Sage Technique and was even more exquisite than the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art.Chu Kuangren\u2019s current cultivation of the Human Mountain Stamp was only at the surface, yet he could confront his enemy with earth qi that he used to condense the move into a divine mountain.1When he truly cultivated it to perfection, he would be a divine mountain and suppress everything!\u201cThis is definitely a Sage Technique! It\u2019s an all-out offensive Sage Technique! My god, he actually mastered an offensive Sage Technique!\u201d4\u201cI have a feeling that this might not be an ordinary Sage Technique. It\u2019s very possible that it\u2019s a Great Sage Technique, and even\u2026 a Sage Ruler Technique!\u201d\u201cSage Ruler Technique? Don\u2019t joke around, that\u2019s impossible. There are only a few Sage Ruler Techniques in the entirety of Firmament Star. How can he possibly have a Sage Ruler Technique?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true\u2026\u201dOnce the Daoists came back to their senses, they immediately started discussing amongst each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He looked battered and bruised with his hair trailing messily over his shoulders as he stared at Chu Kuangren nearby. The raging fury surging in his eyes looked like it could almost materialize and pour out of his eyes. He was so furious that even his face was twitching.A Golden Core cultivator had actually beaten him, a grand Daoist at the Nascent Soul Realm, to the ground. He even did so in front of the other Daoists in the sky.How was he going to maintain the dignity of a Daoist in front of other people in the future if he didn\u2019t make a comeback in today\u2019s match?\u201cChu Kuangren, I underestimated you.\u201cYou want me to go all out, eh? Alright, let me show you the disparity between a Golden Core and a Nascent Soul cultivator!\u201d1Murong Xuan stopped suppressing his cultivation and summoned all of the spirit energy within the spirit ruins in his body. His spirit energy surged violently and poured out in torrents as they turned into flames and rose high into the air.A blazing crimson sun rose to the sky as he used the Daoist Physique Transformation again.That was not all, the flaming spirit energy turned into four blazing golden suns afterward.It was the anomaly of five suns appearing in the same sky!Unparalleled pressure enveloped the sky and earth in this area. The surface of the earth cracked under the scorching heat and the moisture in the air rapidly eroded away.1The land across a 1000-foot radius resembled a scorching hell on earth!One was because of the anomaly unique to his Daoist Physique whereas the other was the anomaly arising from the Divine Nine Suns Art he cultivated. With the two great anomalies supporting each other and Murong Xuan\u2019s perfect Nascent Soul cultivation on top of that, it made his aura frightening beyond comparison.Inexhaustible flames revolved around Murong Xuan and he looked just like a deity who had the sun in his grasp with how the flames reflected off on his face.Chu Kuangren, who had ascended to the Golden Core Realm not too long ago, felt the pressure as he faced Murong Xuan, who had released all of his firepower. No matter what, the disparity in realms between both parties was too great.1One had just stepped into the Golden Core Realm whereas the other was a perfect Nascent Soul Realm cultivator. Regardless of who was watching this, this was a battle that was already decided.1\u201cI might not be able to block this person\u2019s attack using the Human Mountain Stamp, but aside from those techniques, I still have\u2026 The Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart!!!\u201d2Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes were taking in and spitting out purple sword light and he took one step forward. There was a brilliant glow roaming around his body and large Daoist runes revolved around him. The swords all around made buzzing and humming noises as an inexhaustible amount of sword qi converged toward Chu Kuangren.The illusion of a lightweight purple divine sword slowly rose from Chu Kuangren\u2019s body and hovered above his head.The purple divine sword was 90 feet long and many mysterious runes were shuttling back and forth in between the nine small holes on its blade.For a moment, the entire Sword Mountain trembled before him.Countless swords were buzzing incessantly.\u201cSword of The Heavens!!!\u201d Chu Kuangren said in an effortless manner.The Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart was equipped with three great transformations.1The Sword of The Heavens was one of them.At this moment, he had a feeling that he could use all of the swords on Sword Mountain as long as he wanted to!All the long swords stuck on the mountain, including the sacred swords, immediately flew to him when he thought about it and revolved around the Sword of The Heavens.Limitless sword pressure enveloped the sky and earth.Chu Kuangren did not even need to make a move under this pressure. Only a movement in his mind was needed to burst the five blazing suns above Murong Xuan\u2019s head!Not only that, Murong Xuan could not bear the boundless pressure on his body for even a second. He was lying on his stomach the instant the pressure wave touched him!\u201cWhat?!\u201d1\u201cThis is impossible!!!\u201d2Murong Xuan\u2019s pupils abruptly contracted and there was a look of utter disbelief on his face!He cultivated a Sage Technique, had a Daoist Physique Transformation, and was a cultivator at the perfect Nascent Soul Realm, yet Chu Kuangren suppressed him as swiftly as it took one to think!On top of that, Chu Kuangren was merely a Golden Core cultivator!Was a Supreme Daoist Physique really so terrifying?4Murong Xuan was not the only one.A hint of fear rose in the hearts of the other Daoists in the sky!Chu Kuangren\u2019s combat abilities were at this level when he was just a mere Golden Core cultivator, how frightening was his Daoist Physique Transformation going to be when he advanced to the Nascent Soul and Paradise Realm in the future?In the distance.A few Elders of Black Heaven Sect were taking in the whole scene happening on Sword Mountain.\u201cA Supreme Daoist Physique really is terrifying!\u201d\u201cBut isn\u2019t this a little ridiculous? Murong Xuan is a perfect Nascent Soul cultivator and uses Sage Techniques on top of that. How could he lose so tragically?\u201d3\u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d The old man with the white eyebrows smiled and said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you guys take a look at where that place is? It\u2019s Sword Mountain, that is the realm of the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart. It is rather easy for him to condense the sword intent of the countless swords on Sword Mountain to suppress a cultivator at the perfect Nascent Soul realm.\u201dThe other Elders suddenly understood and one of them said, \u201cThat is also true. This Chu Kuangren\u2019s cultivation is still shallow, so the power of his transformation is still far from being perfect. Once his cultivation is slightly higher, he can suppress a cultivator at the Honorable Realm if they were to fight on Sword Mountain, much less one at the Nascent Soul Realm!\u201d\u201cNot bad, not bad. This is the terror of a Supreme Daoist Physique.\u201d\u201cMy Black Heaven Sect can strive for the imperial throne in this era with this person!\u201d\u201cBut should we stop Chu Kuangren?\u201dAt this moment, an Elder who was slightly worried asked, \u201cHe\u2019s young and impetuous after all. What should we do if he kills Murong Xuan?\u201dIn any case, Murong Xuan was a Daoist as well.He was one of the best prodigies in Black Heaven Sect.The old man with the white eyebrows muttered irresolutely to himself for a moment. \u201cLet\u2019s wait and see.\u201dOn Sword Mountain.The Sword of The Heavens was on top of Chu Kuangren\u2019s head and a vortex of sword qi was swirling around him. He was just like a supreme sword deity backed with support from the immense sword intent surrounding him.He slowly walked toward Murong Xuan and stood with his hands behind his back. He looked down at the other party and apathetically said, \u201cDo you accept your loss?\u201d\u201cI do not!!!\u201cYou pressured me with the help of Sword Mountain\u2019s sword intent, how can I be satisfied!?\u201d said Murong Xuan through gritted teeth.Chu Kuangren simply found it amusing. \u201cYou confronted me, a Golden Core cultivator, as a perfect Nascent Soul cultivator yet you\u2019re shameless enough to claim I used the sword intent of Sword Mountain to help me? Then tell me, why am I able to do so?\u201d\u201cRubbish, isn\u2019t it because you have a Supreme Daoist Physique?!\u201d\u201cThen that\u2019s enough. I have a Daoist Physique so being able to draw support from the Sword Mountain\u2019s sword intent is a skill of mine too. Now let me ask you again, do you accept your loss?\u201dThe ground Murong Xuan was kneeling on violently caved in. He felt as though a massive mountain was pressing down on him and it was difficult for him to even move his finger.\u201cDo you have the guts to kill me?\u201d\u201cOh, just try me.\u201dThe pressuring might of sword intent intensified.The bones in Murong Xuan\u2019s body creaked as though they were about to shatter.\u201cI have a Supreme Daoist Physique and am the disciple of the Sect Master. Believe it or not, all I\u2019ll get is a slap on the wrist and detention for a few days for killing you,\u201d Chu Kuangren said calmly.There were only a few cases of Supreme Daoist Physiques since time immemorial.Even though the Crimson Sun Daoist Physique was precious, it couldn\u2019t compare to the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart at all. Thus, even if Chu Kuangren killed Murong Xuan, no one would do anything to him because Black Heaven Sect needed him to strive for the imperial throne!Once he succeeded, Black Heaven Sect would have achieved unprecedented glory!How could a measly Daoist compare to that?Murong Xuan was not an idiot either. He knew that Chu Kuangren was speaking the truth so he quickly said, \u201cI\u2019m convinced, I admit defeat!!!\u201d\u201cAre those merely words coming from your mouth?\u201d\u201cNo, I accept my loss wholeheartedly, I really do.\u201d\u201cOh, then I want to hear you call me Senior Martial Brother,\u201d Chu Kuangren said in an amused tone.Murong Xuan could not help but feel like he wanted to cry, but had no tears to do so.What else could he do then?He just had to do as the other party said.\u201cSenior Martial Brother, Murong Xuan pays his respects to Senior Martial Brother!\u201d\u201cGood boy.\u201dChu Kuangren smiled softly and he dispelled the pressure of the sword intent with his mind. Murong Xuan felt his body lighten and he felt like he had just escaped death. His chest was heaving and sinking as he was gasping for breath on the ground.After that, Chu Kuangren looked at the other Daoists in the sky and said with a smile, \u201cIf Younger Marital Brothers and Sisters up there are unsatisfied with me in any way, you can come down and we can swap pointers. This Senior Martial Brother will accompany you until the very end.\u201d1They looked at each other before they landed on Sword Mountain one after the other.\u201cYou\u2019re joking, Senior Martial Brother. How can we be dissatisfied with you?\u201d\u201cRumour has it that Senior Martial Brother\u2019s elegance moves people. Seeing that today, you really deserve that reputation. This Younger Martial Brother admires you so much that I would prostrate myself in admiration.\u201d\u201cI won\u2019t hide it from Senior Martial Brother, Younger Martial Sister has actually admired you for a very long time.\u201d3The Daoists smiled and looked respectful.What else could they do?Did they not see how Murong Xuan was sprawled on the ground?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The swords returned to their places, and the pressure of sword intent disappeared.Murong Xuan breathed a sigh of relief and looked at Chu Kuangren in awe.He was really frightened.A Nascent Soul was suppressed by just a thought!Even though they were on sword mountain, the encounter showed how terrifying and powerful Chu Kuangren\u2019s Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart was.\u201cYou can come to my Daoist Palace when you have time. I have to go back to nurture the sacred swords now, so I won\u2019t be staying,\u201d Chu Kuangren said.With a wave, Descendant Self was in his hand.With just a thought, the sacred sword merged into the spiritual mound in his body.The spiritual mound was where the source of the cultivator\u2019s spiritual power lied.3It was also the place where the sacred swords were nurtured.1Chu Kuangren nodded slightly at the Daoists, then turned and left. It was evening when he reached Towering Heaven Palace.The incident of Chu Kuangren defeating Murong Xuan had begun to spread in the inner circle of Black Heaven Sect. After all, they were fighting in the sight of the whole sect.\u201cI never thought that Chu Kuangren would be so powerful that even Murong Xuan would be suppressed by him. Wasn\u2019t he an outer sect disciple before this?\u201d\u201cEven his Supreme Taoist Physique was cultivated too quickly.\u201d\u201cHe has a Supreme Taoist Physique, so it\u2019s normal for the sect to groom him. Chu Kuangren is definitely going to be a legend.\u201d\u201cApparently, when he competed with Daoist Murong Xuan, he was able to condense the sword intent of Sword Mountain for his own use, and his combat power was incredible.\u201d\u201cI saw it, too.\u201d\u201cThis person has the appearance of a young emperor!\u201dIf the previous Chu Kuangren was known in Black Heaven Sect for his looks, then he now had everyone\u2019s attention with his ability.\u2026\u201cOh, a Nascent Soul cultivation base experience card?\u201dChu Kuangren could not help but express a little surprise when he saw the prize he had drawn today and smiled with relief.\u201cFinally, a prize that\u2019s actually useful.\u201d1Since Chu Kuangren\u2019s transmigration, all draws were iron grade items except for the first 10 draws.8Today, he finally got a silver grade Nascent Soul cultivation base experience card.\u201cMaster, Murong Xuan, Jun Yi, and other Daoists are visiting.\u201dLil Bing suddenly delivered a message.\u201cI see, bring them and wait for me at the main hall,\u201d Chu Kuangren said.He stretched, got up, and started to dress neatly.When he went out, he saw Lan Yu wearing a blue and white skirt. When she saw him, she stepped forward and bowed slightly.\u201cMaster.\u201d\u201cWell, come with me to meet those Daoists.\u201dInside the main hall of the Towering Heaven Palace.Murong Xuan, Jun Yi, Qin Wushuang, Zhao Linglong, and Zhuo Han came to visit. As soon as they stepped into the Palace, the air around them began to shift. The spiritual qi here was so strong that they were shocked.The place where they live was already one of the blessed lands in Black Heaven Sect, rare in its own right, but it was incomparable to Towering Heaven Palace.The difference between the two was like comparing heaven and earth.\u201cThe place where Senior Brother lives is truly extraordinary.\u201d\u201cThe sect must really value him since he\u2019s bestowed with such a Daoist Palace, I guess it must be the same as the Sect Master.\u201d\u201cThe efficiency of practicing here is ten times that of the outside world.\u201dMurong Xuan and others were in awe.A girl in white walked up to them.\u201cDaoists, the master will come soon, I have prepared tea for you, please wait a moment,\u201d Lil Bing said in salute.Daoist Junyi smiled and said, \u201cThank you very much, sister.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201dLil Bing said. She was flattered.She was just an outer disciple before. On weekdays, she could only watch the true disciples from a distance, surrounded by people like celebrities.This included the Daoists.Now, a Daoist had addressed her respectfully as sister.It felt like a dream.Jun Yi smiled. She did not ignore Lil Bing just because she was an outside disciple but chatted with her instead.The few Daoists observed when they came in that there were no other maids or servants in the huge Daoist Palace except for Lil Bing.Moreover, everyone knew now that Chu Kuangren was the chief disciple of the Black Heaven Sect, and that his future achievements would be extraordinary.As the saying went \u2018When a Daoist ascends, even their livestock follow\u2019. Therefore, how could they offend his only maid? Building a good repertoire with her was the right way.9The few Daoists continued chatting in the main hall.Suddenly, two figures arrived outside the hall.The Daoists looked over and shock emerged in their eyes.There was a man and a woman.The man was dressed in a white unicorn robe with wide sleeves while donning a jade crown. His nose was tall and his features were exquisite, exuding an extraordinary aura like that of an immortal.7The woman was wearing a blue and white skirt with long silver-white hair like a waterfall, and there was as though a dazzling galaxy was hidden in her light blue eyes.She had a sacred and amazingly inviolable aura.Their combined charisma standing side by side was superior to most of the people in the world.One was ethereal and unique.One was cold and holy, like a goddess aloft in the heavens.They were Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu.Chu Kuangren and the few Daoists had known each other before but they could not help feeling confused about Lan Yu beside him.\u2018Who was this woman?\u2019\u2018Was she from Black Heaven Sect? Why had I not heard of her before?\u2019\u2018What is her relationship with Chu Kuangren?\u2019A series of thoughts flashed through their minds.\u201cHey there Senior Brother.\u201d\u201cSenior Brother, may I know who this lady is?\u201dMurong Xuan was more direct and asked about Lan Yu\u2019s origin.\u201cI met her a few days ago when I was away for some relaxation from the sect. She\u2019s my follower now, her name is Lan Yu.\u201d Chu Kuangren did not say much.They were surprised when they heard this.It was unexpected that Chu Kuangren would have followers this soon after he became a Daoist of Black Heaven Sect. Moreover, she was such an outstanding woman.Thinking of this, Murong Xuan and the other men felt a little jealous.10\u201cCome, have a seat.\u201dChu Kuangren sat at the main hall and started chatting with them.They were only at the Towering Heaven Palace for a visit and some exchange of cultivation experiences.\u2026\u201cOh, so that\u2019s the case.\u201dDaoist Zhuo Han seemed to be surprised.Like Chu Kuangren, he also practiced the Saint Technique\u2019s Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art, and the conversation with Chu Kuangren slightly furthered his knowledge.He could not help but lament the fact that the Supreme Daoist Physique was indeed terrifying. He had practiced the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art for ten years, while it had been only less than a month that Chu Kuangren was in contact with this sword art, but his level of comprehension is no longer below him.He was even more unique and honed than him in some aspects.\u201cThis is all just talk, why don\u2019t we move on to some action instead? I\u2019d like to learn a skill or two from you, Senior Brother.\u201dZhuo Han stood up. He wanted to see how far he was from a Supreme Daoist Physique like Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren could read the expression on his face.He knew this would happen sooner or later.Any kind of cultivation exchange would result in a duel.Anything prior was only a formality.He had seen this much too often.\u201cSince Junior Brother Zhuo is in the mood, let\u2019s do it.\u201d2What else could he do?He could only fight.He had only been appointed the chief disciple not long ago. Although these Daoists addressed him as Senior Brother, how many were really sincere?If he refused to fight, they would inevitably have some other thoughts in their hearts.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, few in the history of Black Heaven Sect had been recognized by Azure Crescent.\u201cWell, good sword.\u201dChu Kuangren nodded slightly, then a white light flashed in his hand and the Descendant Self Sacred Sword appeared in his hand. \u201cThis sword is called Descendant Self.\u201dSeeing the aura flow and the sword intent of the sacred sword, Zhuo Han\u2019s mouth twitched, and the arrogance on his face was immediately blown away.Supreme weapon?Compared with the sacred sword, it was nothing.\u201cShall we?\u201dZhuo Han took a deep breath and his vision narrowed. His spiritual qi flowed into the Azure Crescent Sword in his hand, and a stream of sword qi shot out.Chu Kuangren\u2019s sacred sword was swung and it met the sword qi with a slash.Although he had a Golden Core cultivation base, his increased combat power due to his Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart was no less than a Nascent Soul as his spiritual power was even purer.Zhuo Han, as a Daoist, had already reached the Nascent Soul Realm for a long time, but he still felt the pressure from the battle against Chu Kuangren.The two were just sparring and were not at their peak. Chu Kuangren did not even utilize his Daoist Body Transformation.About half an hour later, Zhuo Han motioned for the sparring to stop.\u201cSenior Brother, although your cultivation base is only in the Golden Core Realm, your combat power is amazing, I really respect you,\u201d Zhuo Han said with a smile.\u201cJunior Brother Zhuo, your ability is also extraordinary.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s nothing compared to you, Senior Brother.\u201dThe two exchanged compliments.\u201cMy hands are a little itchy watching the duel.\u201dJun Yi walked up and laughed.\u201cWhy, do you want to learn from the Senior Brother too?\u201dZhuo Han asked.Junyi shook her head. \u201cI\u2019ve seen his strength a long time ago, so I won\u2019t ask for trouble.\u201dShe looked at Lan Yu and smiled. \u201cI am more interested in Miss Lan\u2019s strength. Would you like to teach me a thing or two?The Daoists\u2019 eyes lit up as they were also very interested in the strength of this mysterious woman next to Chu Kuangren.Lan Yu looked at Chu Kuangren, apparently asking for his opinion.\u201cFollow your heart.\u201d Chu Kuangren said.\u201cYes.\u201dLan Yu nodded slightly, and said to Jun Yi, \u201cShall we begin.\u201d\u201cYes, please.\u201dThe two women walked to the center of the practice field.Jun Yi had one of the most advanced cultivation bases of Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Nine Great Daoists. She had a Fragile Water Daoist Physique, and a complete cultivation base of the Nascent Soul.Her ability was on par, if not stronger than Zhuo Han.After a burst of brilliant blue light, an azure blue long sword appeared in front of Jun Yi. Judging from the mesmerizing aura flowing above the sword, it was at least a supreme weapon.Lan Yu was also enveloped in light as her dress disappeared and was replaced by a set of gorgeous silver-white armor.\u201cWhat an extraordinary set of armor.\u201d\u201cWell, that must also be of supreme quality at the very least. This complete armor set of supreme grade is extremely rare. Seems like Miss Lan does come from an extraordinary background.\u201dThe Daoists held a look of surprise.\u201cSuch beautiful armor.\u201dJunyi\u2019s eyes showed envy.Their initial impression of Lan Yu was of someone cold and divine, but now, after donning this silver-white armor, she had some added heroism, like a female god of war.Having had enough of being in awe, Jun Yi struck first.She squeezed and injected her spiritual qi into the blue long sword in front of her.The sound of splashing water echoed around the area.The azure blue long sword shot several water-imbued streams of sword qi towards Lan Yu.Lan Yu stood still, letting the sword qi collide with her body. With a crash, the streams of sword qi shattered with Lan Yu still standing still.The sword qi had no effect on her armor.\u201cAgain.\u201dJun Yi, taken aback, continuously injected spiritual qi into the blue long sword. The blue radiance from the sword flickered and flashed while the majestic sword aura gushed out like a flood.\u201cOh, not bad.\u201d Lan Yu smiled faintly. Facing the attack, she took a step forward while balling her hand into a fist and punched forwards.A huge crash could be heard from the collision, as though there was a whip cracking.The silver-white light engulfed in sacred and majestic intent from Lan Yu\u2019s fist exploded, and the surge of sword qi was completely shattered!Jun Yi took a few steps back from shock.She looked surprised and muttered, \u201cNascent Soul cultivation base!\u201dLan Yu made a gesture and her cultivation base was immediately exposed to everyone.It was early-stage Nascent Soul!Although Lan Yu was only in the early stages of Nascent Soul, the power of her punch surprised the Daoists because it should have been impossible even for someone in the middle or even the late stage of Nascent Soul.However, Lan Yu did it effortlessly.\u201cLan Yu\u2019s ability is really impressive.\u201d2Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes lit up.The others might not have known, but he knew that Lan Yu had a Holy Radiant Physique which was a Supreme Daoist Physique.In addition, Lan Yu also cultivated Saint Techniques and Supreme Techniques, making her unparalleled in combat power which was leagues ahead of an ordinary Nascent Soul Realm.Even a prodigal Nascent Soul could hardly compare.\u201cMiss Lan methods are really extraordinary.\u201dJun Yi sighed from the bottom of her heart. Then, her spiritual qi was exerted again to activate her supreme technique. A mysterious aura enveloped her and the sword, and an illusion of the Yangtze River rushing forth appeared in the air.The sound of rushing water was incessant\u201cThree thousand Fragile Water!\u201d2Junyi shouted.Suddenly, the rushing Yangtze River gushed towards Lan Yu with immense force.This was an offensive supreme technique that was executed using the complete Nascent Soul of Jun Yi, unleashing unparalleled power.Lan Yu did not back down. \u201cWell done!\u201dThere was a silvery-white glow in her eyes that released a stream of sacred and solemn intent that surrounded her body, as if she were a god that had descended to earth.\u201cStatic Light Fist!\u201dLan Yu again punched forwards.A white beam of light burst out and rushed towards the charging Yangtze River.The two forces collided, threatening to tear the air itself apart.The impact produced a shockwave so strong that even Murong Xuan, Zhuo Han, and the others who were watching could not help taking a few steps back.Lil Bing exclaimed and was almost blown away.4At that critical moment, Chu Kuangren stretched his arm out to catch her by the waist and then shielded her behind him by forming a wall with his spiritual qi.2Behind Chu Kuangren, Lil Bing felt a warmth rise up from her heart and a sense of security that she had never felt before, even if the back she was hiding behind was not all that impressive.1She felt a rush of dopamine from the sense of security she had.Not to mention, he was such a godly individual.At this moment, Lil Bing had completely fallen head over heels for Chu Kuangren.5Jun Yi and Lan Yu continued to compete.Neither party was fighting at their peak, but Jun Yi found that even if she did her best, she was not sure that she could defeat Lan Yu.Finally, Junyi retracted the azure blue long sword and offered to stop.Lan Yu nodded slightly and changed back to her blue and white dress. Her bright armor was kept away within her incredibly conveniently.\u201cBirds of the same feather flock together. The people around Senior Brother are indeed elites.\u201d Jun Yi smiled.Chu Kuangren smiled back, \u201cWhat Junior Sister Jun said is true, my few junior brothers and sisters are indeed elites.\u201dJunyi was complimenting Lan Yu, but Chu Kuangren\u2019s words included all of them.These words served to tie the group closer to one another.

He smiled lightly. \u201cNangong Huang, the top Daoist is finally here.\u201dOn the surface, the status of the Nine Great Daoists was not in any particular order but varied in strengths and weaknesses. Nangong Huang, however, was undisputedly the strongest among them.Although there was no such ranking officially, Nangong Huang was the Elder Senior Brother of all the disciples in the Black Heaven Sect before Chu Kuangren.Now, however, Chu Kuangren had suddenly emerged onto the scene, and Honorable Xuan Qi decreed that he would hold the title of Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect.It would be strange if Nangong Huang made no retaliation.\u201cCome, let\u2019s go and meet\u2026 Junior Brother Nangong.\u201dChu Kuangren laughed.He emphasized \u2018Junior Brother Nangong\u2019 playfully.Outside Towering Heaven Palace.Nangong Huang stood with his hands behind him. He wore a purple robe and his porcelain face was exceptionally handsome. The young disciples were bedazzled.\u201cIs that Senior Brother Nangong? He\u2019s so handsome.\u201d\u201cI heard that Senior Brother Nangong was recognized by a sacred sword when he was in the Golden Core Realm, and not only that, he possesses the extraordinary Yinyang God-eye.\u201d\u201cHe came here looking for Chu Kuangren, is it over the title of Elder Senior Brother? Does he want revenge?\u201d\u201cBah, the position of Elder Senior Brother should belong to Senior Brother Nangong regardless, who does Chu Kuangren think he is?\u201d\u201cShh\u2026 Be careful!\u201d\u201cHey, what\u2019s your problem? Do you have something against Senior Brother Chu? Speak respectfully or I\u2019ll tear out that mouth of yours.\u201d\u201cOh, wow, did Chu Kuangren feed you your breakfast today? All of you want to be his lackeys, aren\u2019t you just after his looks?\u201dAs the top Daoist, Nangong Huang naturally had a group of supporters in Black Heaven Sect. Although Chu Kuangren had not shown up much in the past few days, he had also gained a lot of fans with his looks.For a moment, the two sides quarreled intensely.After a while, a figure in white walked out of Towering Heaven Palace.Chu Kuangren showed up with Lan Yu, and their appearance immediately attracted the attention of everyone present.Especially Chu Kuangren, who was in front. His outstanding white robe lent him the aura of a deity.The crowd was, of course, stunned.Even some of the ones who had slandered him retracted their words.\u201cIs this our new leader? Love it.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too good-looking.\u201d\u201cThe white robe is exceptional, I guess this is how immortals are.\u201d\u201cThere are such men in this world?\u201d\u201cWait, look at the woman next to Elder Senior Brother, who is she? Why have I not heard of such a beautiful woman before?\u201d\u201cI wouldn\u2019t know who I should be jealous of if these two people stood together.\u201d\u201cIs she the Daoist companion of Big Brother?\u201d7\u201cSob. Elder Senior Brother already has a partner? I\u2019m broken-hearted.\u201d4Their arrival sparked discussion and surprise.Nangong Huang\u2019s face changed as he stood in front of the Daoist Palace. He snorted to himself, \u2018What\u2019s the point of all this showiness?\u2019\u201cJunior Brother Nangong, since you\u2019re here, please come in.\u201dChu Kuangren mocked with laughter.After hearing himself being addressed, Nangong Huang frowned slightly and said indifferently, \u201cWhat did you just call me?\u201d\u201cJunior Brother Nangong. Is something wrong?\u201dChu Kuangren blinked and said.\u201cI\u2019ll have you know, you have to earn the right to be my Senior Brother.\u201dNangong Huang said lightly as the force around his body became stronger.\u201cAh, It seems that there\u2019s some dissatisfaction within you.\u201d\u201cI have my reservations. Black Heaven Sect is a sage orthodoxy, and the Lead Disciple is the face of Black Heaven Sect. The position can\u2019t be filled by just anyone. I came here today to verify your qualifications.\u201d\u201cThat means you\u2019re here to challenge me.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dNangong Huang said bluntly.This was indeed his goal today. He wanted to defeat Chu Kuangren in front of everyone to reclaim the title of Elder Senior Brother!Chu Kuangren smiled. \u201cDo you really want to do this?\u201d\u201cYou can surrender if you\u2019re afraid\u201dNan Gonghuang said indifferently.The Daoists beside Chu Kuangren looked at each other.\u201cSenior Brother, Nangong Huang\u2019s cultivation base has reached the half-step Paradise Realm, which is much stronger than the ordinary complete Nascent Soul, plus he has the Yinyang God-eye. He\u2019s not far from a Paradise Realm Cultivator.\u201d2Murong Xuan whispered beside Chu Kuangren.Even these handful of Daoists did not think much of Chu Kuangren. Regardless, Chu Kuangren was only in the Golden Core Realm.Compared to Nangong Huang, his cultivation base was leagues behind.\u201cMaster, let me fight for you,\u201d Lan Yu said, staring at Nangong Huang, her eyes exuding hostility like a sharp knife.Anyone who offended Chu Kuangren was her enemy!Nangong Huang frowned slightly.He actually felt pressured by Lan Yu\u2019s aura.Who was this woman?\u201cNo, it\u2019s me that Junior Brother wants to challenge.\u201dChu Kuangren smiled faintly as he took a few steps forward and walked to Nangong Huang, smiling. \u201cThen, Junior Brother, I\u2019m looking forward to your tutelage.\u201dThe way Chu Kuangren addressed him as \u2018Junior Brother\u2019 enraged Nangong Huang.\u201cI\u2019ll show you who the real Elder Senior Brother is!\u201dAfter Nangong Huang finished speaking, a white light flashed in front of him as a long sword suddenly appeared, and a powerful stream of sword intent burst forth.\u201cIt\u2019s the Sacred Deep Pool Rainbow Sword!\u201d1\u201cSuch a powerful sword intent, it\u2019s indeed worthy of a sacred sword!\u201dEveryone exclaimed in awe when the sacred sword appeared.Chu Kuangren also instantly summoned Descendant Self.The aura of the two sacred swords collided in the air and an invisible wave of pressure spread out. Many onlookers felt that the surrounding air seemed to be filled with an innumerable amount of small swords, cutting their bodies.\u201cWaterfall Sword Art!\u201dNangong Huang grasped the Sacred Deep Pool Rainbow Sword and struck first.A flash of white light flew out like a waterfall in the air as the vast and enveloping force of the sword surged towards Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren responded by unleashing his own terrifying aura.He held the Sacred Sword, Descendant Self, and his aura shifted mysteriously. At this moment, it was unable to differentiate the sword and its handler!It was the union of a man and a sword!This was the union of a human and a sword that countless swordsmen had dreamt of!Chu Kuangren slashed forwards with his sword and a ray of domineering purple light gushed out, shattering the silver sword light in an instant!Impacted by the terrifying sword aura, Nangong Huang took a few steps back.He looked at Chu Kuangren in disbelief. \u201cHow is it possible!\u201dHe was actually forced back by a single slash!\u201cNascent Soul cultivation base!\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother\u2019s cultivation base has reached the Nascent Soul Realm!\u201dMurong Xuan, Jun Yi, and the others looked on in disbelief.The cultivation base displayed by Chu Kuangren at that moment was, surprisingly, the Nascent Soul Realm!The spiritual qi of the Nascent Soul Realm under the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, along with the unison of sword and man enabled Chu Kuangren to deter Nangong Huang with a single slash of the sword!\u2018It\u2019s a good thing I managed to draw the Nascent Soul Cultivation Base Experience Card today. Otherwise, dealing with this Nangong Huang might not be this easy.\u2019Chu Kuangren felt the surging spiritual power in his body as he thought to himself.Just a moment ago, he had used the Nascent Soul Cultivation Base Experience Card, which gave him the strength to rise to the Nascent Soul Realm.The effect of the Experience Card would only last for an hour, though, but that single hour was sufficient for Chu Kuangren.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

As he drew in a deep breath, his cold gaze fell on his adversary.\u201cYour ability is far greater than I expected, but if you think that you can be the Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect just like that, then you\u2019re wrong!\u201cTake this!\u201cGolden Time Immemorial Light!\u201d Nangong Huang exerted his internal spiritual qi and a layer of golden Dao patterns appeared on his skin.Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cGolden Time Immemorial Light Art!\u201dThere were three major Sage Techniques in Black Heaven Sect.They were the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art, Divine Nine Suns Art, and Golden Time Immemorial Light Art.Among them, the Golden Time Immemorial Light Art could let one master a divine power called Golden Time Immemorial Light, which was both offensive and defensive, and was extremely mysterious.Nangong Huang\u2019s body was covered with golden light as he held the Deep Pool Rainbow Sacred Sword in his hand with an aura of invincibility around him. With great momentum, he suddenly struck with his sword and the golden light on his body erupted.The golden light enveloped the sword Qi and dashed towards Chu Kuangren.\u201cHuman Mountain Stamp!\u201d2Chu Kuangren laughed.A mysterious Daoist hymn flowed out of his body, and the surrounding air crackled in response.With the mysterious art in his hands, the spiritual qi within him congealed into a sacred ancient mountain, crushing the golden sword qi.The two forces collided with a blast.The residual shockwave from the energy collision left holes and sword marks on the ground.Chu Kuangren and Nangong Huang retreated from each other\u2019s attacks.\u201cWhat technique was that?\u201dNangong Huang was stunned as he saw the Human Mountain Stamp for the first time.However, in the next instant, Chu Kuangren was already beside him with his palm covered in energy as he performed the Human Mountain Stamp again.1The terrifying impact caused the golden light on Nangong Huang\u2019s body to start cracking, followed by the sound of cracking bones.Puff!Nangong Huang vomited blood and was knocked away by the extreme force.Chu Kuangren stood in front of Nangong Huang with his hands behind his back, his deistic white robes and demeanor remaining untouched.\u201cWow\u2026 So strong!\u201d\u201cNangong Huang\u2019s Golden Time Immemorial Light is being broken!\u201d\u201cFor so many years, with the exception of those high-level cultivators, even a Daoist couldn\u2019t break Senior Brother Nangong\u2019s golden light!\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren is indeed powerful.\u201d\u201cHis elegance is really fascinating.\u201dChu Kuangren stood not far from Nangong Huang and smiled lightly. \u201cJunior Brother Nangong, you\u2019re a bit different from what I expected\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re much weaker.\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dNangong Huang\u2019s face sank with rage.The spiritual power in his body circulated wildly around him. As it got more and more concentrated, a flash of white light came out of his eyes, and a mysterious Daoist hymn began.\u201cChu Kuangren, take this!\u201cYinyang God Light!\u201dThe Yinyang God Light was part of the Yinyang God-eye\u2019s divine power, and the divine light from it was extremely mysterious. If used to attack the enemy, even a cultivator within a realm higher than Nangong Huang would hardly be able to block it.Chu Kuangren only saw the black and white divine light flowing out from Nangong Huang\u2019s eyes, forming a vortex where Yin and Yang intent instantly enveloped him.\u201cSword of The Heavens!\u201d Chu Kuangren did not move, and a majestic stream of sword intent broke out with purple brilliance and rose to the sky, evolving into a sword of heaven above his head with nine holes.The Daoist Physique vision appeared and Chu Kuangren\u2019s combat power increased again.Holding the Descendant Self Sacred Sword, he slashed towards the black and white divine light.The union of man and sword!The stream of domineering purple sword light violently collided with the Yinyang divine light. Everything surrounding them shook from the impact.It seemed like the palace was going to collapse at any moment!Gradually, the Yinyang divine light was eroded by the sword light!The Yinyang God-eye was indeed at the high-end range of the Three-Thousand Physiques, but it could not be compared to the Supreme Daoist Physique like the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart.The Sword Of The Heavens broke through the Yinyang divine light!Nangong Huang was blasted a few hundred feet away by the sword light again. The golden light on his body was torn apart when it came into contact with the sword qi, which invaded and passed through his body like countless small needles, churning his flesh and blood!\u201cIt\u2019s the Supreme Daoist Physique!\u201d3Nangong Huang\u2019s pupils shrank and his face trembled in shock.\u201cNine Heaven Sword Prison!\u201dChu Kuangren shouted.A stream of overwhelming sword qi flowed out of his body, covering ten thousand square feet with its boundless sword intent!It was like a prison!It was the second-highest tier of the exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, Nine Heaven Sword Prison!Nangong Huang felt the sword qi around him and grew pale. He had been wounded back to back and was powerless to face this next attack.However, this was not over yet.\u201cGreen Lotus Sword Song!\u201dThe sword qi above him streamed under the feet of Chu Kuangren as they intertwined and transformed into a huge green lotus. The lotus had 36 petals, and each petal had a mysterious pattern to it as if they were replicating the intents of a sword.A sound like the swishes of swords cutting through the air rang out, stimulating thousands of sword weapons in Black Heaven Sect, even the sword mountain in the distance let out a sky-shattering chant.The Sword Of The Heavens above Chu Kuangren stepped on the Green Lotus\u2019 sword qi and then unfolded the Nine-Day Sword Prison. The three major visions of the Daoist Physiques were all unveiled at once!He walked towards Nangong Huang step by step, like a peerless sword deity!The countless disciples who saw this scene were shocked beyond their wits, and Nangong Huang, who was suppressed by the three major visions, was already trembling all over!\u201cThis is impossible!\u201cHow can he be so powerful!\u201dIn Nangong Huang\u2019s left and right eyes, the black and white divine lights flickered as he tried to drive the Yingyang God-eye to resist the three major visions of the Daoist Physique.Nevertheless, it was useless!His eyes were so sore that he could not perform the divine light.Out of the Three-Thousand Physiques in the world, the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart was ranked in the top ten of the Supreme Daoist Physiques. The Yinyang God-eye would not be able to compare with it.Only then did Nangong Huang realize how huge the disparity between them was.\u201cGulp\u2026\u201dMurong Xuan, who was nearby, swallowed his saliva.Not long ago, Chu Kuangren only used the Sword Of The Heavens to deal with him at Sword Mountain, but he could already draw the sword intent of Sword Mountain for his own use. Now, the three major visions of Chu Kuangren were all unveiled. If this place was Sword Mountain, how devastating would it be?Murong Xuan dared not imagine that scenario.Nonetheless, he became more and more in awe of Chu Kuangren.The same went for the rest of the Daoists.Disciples watching around looked at Chu Kuangren like he was a peerless sword deity, and had truly recognized him as the Elder Senior Brother in their hearts.\u201cNo wonder the sect leader made a decree that Chu Kuangren was to become the lead Elder Senior Brother, he does have natural talent!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m truly convinced.\u201d\u201cWho can compare to this peerless talent?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that the younger generation of the entire Azure Dragon Domain would not have someone that can compete with Elder Senior Brother\u201d\u201cNot just the Azure Dragon Domain, even if you look at the entire Firmament Star, the Elder Senior Brother\u2019s talent is definitely one of the best.\u201dThe disciples discussed amongst themselves in awe of Chu Kuangren.Especially the young female disciples. Seeing Chu Kuangren\u2019s looks and demeanor, their eyes lit up.\u201cNo matter what the others say, he is my Elder Senior Brother.\u201d\u201cOh my god, how can he be so good-looking.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s handsome and powerful, it makes people want more.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

With his own aura, he was like a peerless sword deity, and all the disciples watching the duel were convinced.At a distance, inside the Longevity Hall.Honorable Xuan Qi suddenly opened his eyes, and there was a flash of surprise in them. \u201cThe Supreme Daoist Physique is indeed impressive, it easily crushes the combat power of anyone else in the same realm. Black Heaven Sect will be in great prosperity!\u201cThe fortune-teller said that the reopening of this world\u2019s emperor\u2019s road will break the shackles of the ancient emperor. Kuangren has the Supreme Daoist Physique, and he is sure to fight for the throne of this world. Kuangren, don\u2019t let me down.\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi whispered softly with endless expectation in his eyes.The other high-level members in the Black Heaven Sect also noticed the Daoist rhyme pouring out of Chu Kuangren, and in the same way, there was hope in their hearts.\u2026At Towering Heaven Palace.Chu Kuangren displayed the three major Daoist Physique visions and slowly walked towards Nangong Huang, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll call you Junior Brother, are you going to acknowledge it or not?\u201dNangong Huang\u2019s expression changed, and his eyes were full of dissatisfaction.However, in front of Chu Kuangren, he did not even have the ability to resist, let alone fight him for the position of the Lead Senior Brother.After pondering for a while, Nangong Huang lowered his head and with a respectful tone. \u201cGreetings, Elder Senior Brother!\u201dBlack Heaven Sect\u2019s most powerful Daoist declared his surrender in a single sentence.Countless disciples were shocked!Even Nangong Huang was defeated. At this moment, no one questioned the identity of Chu Kuangren any longer and he was the Lead Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect!\u201cThat\u2019s very polite of you, Junior Brother Nangong.\u201dChu Kuangren smiled faintly as he withdrew the three major Daoist Physique visions.The boundless sword pressure gradually dissipated, and the soaring sword chants of the Black Heaven Sword Mountain in the distance also disappeared, restoring calm.\u201cJunior Brother, please come in.\u201dAfter conquering Nangong Huang, Chu Kuangren respectfully invited him into the Daoist Palace.Nangong Huang had just stepped into the Daoist Palace and was also shocked by the abundant spiritual qi inside. The Daoist Palace where he was located was also one of the best cultivation sites, but it was incomparable to Towering Heaven Palace.They exchanged cultivation philosophies in the Daoist Palace. With the addition of Nangong Huang, their conversation lasted for the entire day.After everyone left, Chu Kuangren stretched and yawned. \u201cThese people are really talkative. I\u2019m exhausted.\u201dLil Bing brought a cup of tea to him.\u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Master.\u201dChu Kuangren said to the two women after taking a sip of tea, \u201cSo, how was it? Since both of you have been listening for so long, did you learn something?\u201d\u201cYes, I have benefited a lot from it.\u201d Lil Bing nodded and said as she blushed with excitement.They were indeed the top young cultivators of their generation, and their cultivation experience was no less than that of some cultivators who had practiced for hundreds of years. Their discussion had indeed benefited Lil Bing.Lil Bing even felt that if she went into retreat now, she might break through to the Golden Core Realm in minutes. One had to know that most of those who could reach the Golden Core Realm in Black Heaven Sect were true disciples, and Lil Bing was only an outer disciple.\u201cFair.\u201d Lan Yu nodded slightly.Although Nangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and others had a different direction of cultivation than hers, she could benefit from it as there were still many things that could be used for reference, which would also help her practice.\u201cThat\u2019s good.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded.He also pondered it quite a bit.In this exchange, he also had some epiphanies, the most important of which was that he felt that he lacked methods of offense.He had the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart. Of course, he was heavily invested in the sword path at this stage, but he knew very few sword path methods.Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art mainly cultivated the foundational and basic moves, while some of the other moves were only medium and high-grade techniques. Compared with the Waterfall Sword Art, the Heavenly Sun Sword Art was a lot worse.Although the three major Daoist Physique visions could make up for it, the vision was still a vision after all, and it was still different from the practice of a formal cultivation method.\u201cAlthough the Human Mountain Stamp is powerful, it is not a true sword path technique. It doesn\u2019t give a meaningful contribution to the role of the Daoist Physique. No matter what, I need to learn the sword path Supreme Technique.\u201d1Chu Kuangren whispered to himself.Just as he was lost in his thoughts, the voice of Honorable Xuan Qi rang in his ear. \u201cKuangren, come.\u201dChu Kuangren was slightly startled, then said farewell to Lan Yu and Lil Bing.In the Longevity Hall.Honorable Xuan Qi was sitting on a futon. When he sensed that Chu Kuangren was coming, he turned and looked at him with consolation in his eyes.\u201cWhen I made you the Lead Disciple that day, I knew that Nangong Huang and other Daoists would not accept you easily, but I didn\u2019t expect you to convince them in just a few days, which is impressive.\u201dChu Kuangren rolled his eyes in his heart.He deduced that while he was troubled by the few Daoists, this cheapskate Sect Master was watching a show in secret and would not help him.\u201cSect Master, you are indeed correct.\u201d However, he also knew that the other party was testing him, and there was nothing to be calculative about, so he complimented him.\u201cHave you encountered any blockages during your cultivation practice these few days?\u201dChu Kuangren thought for a while and brought up the lack of offensive methods.Honorable Xuan Qi smiled faintly. \u201cThis is easy to handle. There are many sword path techniques in the Black Heaven Sect Library. You can take this jade order and read what you want at will.\u201dHe took out a simple jade order and gave it to Chu Kuangren, and then said, \u201cKuangren, this is a world of great competition. Black Heaven Sect\u2019s hope is on you. You have to work hard.\u201d\u201cI will not let you down.\u201d\u201cYes\u2026\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi continued to encourage him a little bit more.Then, Chu Kuangren left the Longevity Hall.The library was an important place in Black Heaven Sect. Aside from all kinds of cultivation methods, there were also all kinds of strange records.An old man with white eyebrows was in charge of the library. This person was the high-level elder of Black Heaven Sect, ranked seventh with an extraordinary cultivation base.When he saw Chu Kuangren arrive, the Seventh Elder\u2019s eyes lit up and he greeted him, \u201cHeh, the boss is here. What might you be looking for?\u201dChu Kuangren was not only the Lead Disciple of Black Heaven Sect, but he also had the Supreme Daoist Physique and Black Heaven Sect\u2019s key to fighting for the throne of the world. Even the high-level elders did not dare to neglect it.\u201cHello, Seventh Elder.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded slightly. \u201cI came here to find some sword path cultivation methods.\u201d\u201cBlack Heaven Sect\u2019s cultivation methods are on the second and third floors. You can view them there, I\u2019ll leave you to it.\u201d\u201cAs will I, Seventh Elder.\u201dThe Library was divided into five floors. The first floor contained various books on biography, humanities, geography, and astronomy.The true cultivation methods were on the second and third floors, and the fourth floor was a variety of rare Supreme Techniques from the outside world, a place where only the true disciples were qualified to enter.The fifth floor had the least books, but it was also the most important, containing the foundation of Black Heaven Sect. Besides the Sect Head, even the Daoists had to go through the formalities and get approval before entering.However, Chu Kuangren had the jade order from the Honorable Xuan Qi, therefore all floors were accessible to him freely.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They say he can even overshadow the sun and the moon, and he can indeed!\u201d\u201cThere really are such men in the world\u2026\u201dCountless disciples were all talking in low voices, the initially quiet library suddenly became a little noisy, and Chu Kuangren frowned slightly.\u201cQuiet.\u201dAn old voice sounded.It was Seventh Elder who noticed the commotion and responded.Once Seventh Elder spoke, the noise was suddenly suppressed, but everyone still had their gaze on Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren could only pretend to be unaware as he walked straight to a row of bookshelves, retrieving a sword Dao classic.\u201cTop-tier method, Thirteen Wind Sword.\u201dChu Kuangren whispered the name of this classic.Then he walked aside and started to read.After a while, Chu Kuangren knew the secrets of Thirteen Wind Swords and had completely mastered this method.1The one who possessed the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart was an inherent sword Dao cultivator who could quickly master any sword technique, which was extremely terrifying.Chu Kuangren could comprehend sage techniques such as Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art in half a day, what more this top-tier method?2After he had finished with the sword Dao classic, Chu Kuangren was determined to test the limits of his Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart. He did not rush to the fourth floor to learn the supreme techniques but stayed on the third floor.He continued to learn the remaining sword techniques on the third floor.\u201cGreen Wind Sword Shadow.\u201d\u201cMoon Sword Art.\u201d\u201cLi\u2019s Twenty-Six Way Sword.\u201d\u201cEvil-warding Sword Technique\u2026Uh, this name is really good.\u201d8\u201cDragon Sword.\u201d\u201cYinyang Sword.\u201dChu Kuangren drew another sword Dao classic from the bookshelf and flipped through it quickly, again grasping it almost instantly. As he continued to be enlightened by a variety of sword Dao methods, he seemed to have a deeper understanding of sword Dao.The people in the library were none the wiser of Chu Kuangren\u2019s skill, so they thought that he was constantly looking and flipping through the books.\u201cWhat is Elder Senior Brother doing?\u201d\u201cYes, he puts every book back just after a short while, why would he take it out if he didn\u2019t learn it?\u201d\u201cStrange, what\u2019s he here for?\u201dMany disciples were puzzled.There were also some female disciples who were watching Chu Kuangren. \u201cCan\u2019t believe he can be this handsome even while flipping through books.\u201d2Time quickly flew by and very quickly, the entire morning had passed.As Chu Kuangren read more sword Dao classics, the deeper he understood the sword Dao, the faster he flipped through the books.The library\u2019s third floor had tens of thousands of cultivation techniques, and Black Heaven Sect was the expert at sword Dao, making up almost 30% of all the cultivation techniques found within the sectIn a single morning, out of the 3,000 sword Dao techniques, Chu Kuangren had mastered five to six hundred types. No one would believe it.On the first floor of the library.Seventh Elder sat on a reclined chair and closed his eyes slightly as he released his spiritual thoughts, paying attention to the actions of Chu Kuangren on the third floor.\u201cWhat is the leader doing?\u201d Seventh Elder suddenly opened his eyes, and a confused expression appeared on his face.4Even though there was no definitive way of confirming the secret behind Chu Kuangren\u2019s actions, was this lad actually mastering cultivation techniques just by flipping through the books?The thought popped up in Seventh Elder\u2019s head.Then, he shook his head and felt it was a little absurd.However, when he thought about Chu Kuangren\u2019s Supreme Daoist Physique, he could not dismiss the idea. \u201cIt was rumored that the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart can quickly master any sword Dao method. Is he really doing that?\u201dHe recalled the classics that Chu Kuangren had previously flipped.They were all related to sword Dao cultivation.Seventh Elder felt goosebumps rise on his skin just thinking of the possibility.Could the Supreme Daoist Physique be this terrifying?Seventh Elder continued to release his spiritual thoughts and continued to pay attention to Chu Kuangren\u2019s actions.Six hundred books, seven hundred books, eight hundred books\u2026One thousand one hundred books, one thousand two hundred books, one thousand three hundred books\u2026Chu Kuangren kept flipping through the sword Dao classics on the third floor of the library, and his understanding of sword Dao was also rapidly improving.The next day, Chu Kuangren had finished reading one thousand six hundred and ten sword Dao classics, and a soft sword hymn could be heard coming from his body.2When Seventh Elder who had been observing Chu Kuangren and felt this kind of sword hymn, the shock in his heart emerged on his face.\u201cA natural Dao technique! The leader is having a Dao enlightenment!\u201dDao enlightenment was an extremely rare state for cultivators some would never reach in their lifetime.It was said that in ancient times, there was an emperor who sat under a withered tree for three days and nights, then broke through the three realms in one day and became a peerless Sage Ruler!5Some people fully comprehend an Emperor\u2019s Scripture in the state of Dao enlightenment.There were countless rumors like these circulating among cultivators.However, without exception, all Dao enlighteners could reap great rewards!\u201cI must notify the Sect leaders.\u201dSeventh Elder quickly took out the communication compass to notify Honorable Xuan Qi.One second before he sent the message, Honorable Xuan Qi came to the library. When he saw Chu Kuangren flipping the book, his face was overjoyed. \u201cNatural Dao technique, he is indeed having a Dao enlightenment!\u201d\u201cQuick, tell everyone in the library to leave, don\u2019t disturb Kuangren\u2019s Dao enlightenment. Seal the place and don\u2019t let anyone come near!\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi said quickly.The state of Dao enlightenment was extremely rare, he could not let anyone disturb Chu Kuangren. Disturbing a person during Dao enlightenment was equivalent to murdering their parents!3Soon, the other disciples in the library were brought out without knowing the reason. Then, Honorable Xuan Qi and the elders guarded the library and did not allow others to approach.1Because Chu Kuangren was in Dao enlightenment, the entire Black Heaven Sect shook and trembled.Many disciples watched Honorable Xuan Qi and other high-level people, usually absent, gather in the library with shocked faces.\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation? Why are all these big shots here?\u201d\u201cLook at them, they seem to be\u2026 Guarding the place?\u201d\u201cGuarding? Are you kidding? Even the Honorable Xuan Qi is here and you\u2019re telling me that they are standing guard? Who is so important that all the top leaders are guarding him?\u201d\u201cIt seems that there is only one person in the library!\u201d\u201cI heard an elder talk about a Dao enlightenment. Could it be that Elder Senior Brother is in Dao enlightenment now? And the heads are protecting him?\u201d\u201cEnlightenment! Big brother is in Dao enlightenment!\u201d\u201cIf this is the case, then it makes sense. It seems that the heads really value Elder Senior Brother since they are protecting him.\u201d\u201cEnlightenment\u2026 I\u2019m a little confused, wasn\u2019t Elder Senior Brother flipping through books in the library? Did he flip his way to Dao enlightenment just like that?\u201d7\u201cElder Senior Brother is truly god-like!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Now that he\u2019s going through Dao enlightenment, Elder Senior Brother will rise to the top of the young generation in Azure Dragon domain in the future.\u201d\u201cAccording to the rumors, the world\u2019s number one divine predictor said a few years ago that Emperor\u2019s Path will restart and there will be another emperor in this era! In my opinion, Elder Senior Brother will surely be able to ascend to the throne!\u201dThe few Daoists could not contain their awe.Nangong Huang, who had just been defeated by Chu Kuangren, showed a wry smile. \u201cIt seems that it\u2019ll be close to impossible for me to surpass him.\u201d3Although he was utterly convinced by Chu Kuangren, there would be no man that would not want to be the best of their generation and be on top.1Nangong Huang was no exception.However, Chu Kuangren was so enchanting that he could not help but feel weak in his presence.4\u2026In the library.Chu Kuangren was still reading various sword Dao classics.In the state of Dao enlightenment, he was learning and comprehending sword Dao methods faster and faster. A sword Dao classic could be mastered just by glancing at it once. This was a dream for any swordsman in the world.Nevertheless, Chu Kuangren was calm, without sadness or joy.At this time, he was immersed in the mystery of sword Dao.Soon, he had read all three thousand sword Dao classics on the third floor of the library, and his understanding of the sword Dao far exceeded how it was before.\u201cGo to the fourth floor!\u201dChu Kuangren immediately went to the fourth floor of the library.The classics here were fewer when compared to the third floor, but all of them were supreme techniques, and there were hundreds of them. Moreover, there were nearly a hundred types of sword Dao methods.Chu Kuangren picked up a copy of a supreme technique.\u201cHeaven-Defying Azure Dragon Sword Art!\u201dHe flipped through the copy of the sword art.Compared to the methods of the third floor, the supreme methods on the fourth floor were much more intriguing as they were not at the same level.Even if it was Chu Kuangren, he occasionally needed to pause and think to understand the mysteries behind each classic. If Chu Kuangren had not read the three thousand sword Dao classics just now, he would need more than a short pause.Nonetheless, it was still terrifying in the eyes of others!If the other cultivators wanted to comprehend one supreme technique, even the true disciples of Black Heaven Sect would take a year or so to achieve success, but Chu Kuangren had mastered nearly ten supreme techniques in less than half a day!\u201cExquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart plus the state of Dao enlightenment is really terrifying!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible for an ordinary person to comprehend supreme techniques without ten years of practice, even if he was a genius, it would take a year and a half, but every time the leader flips a copy of supreme technique, the sword hymn in him becomes stronger!\u201d\u201cLooking at what he\u2019s done before, I think he\u2019s already mastered it. It\u2019s just too frightening that ten supreme techniques could be mastered in half a day. What kind of fairy tale is this? I wouldn\u2019t believe it if I had not seen it with my own eyes.\u201dSeveral high-level elders were all shocked as well.Honorable Xuan Qi was no exception.At that moment, they were all ecstatic.\u201cWith him here, the Emperor\u2019s throne will belong to Black Heaven Sect!\u201d\u201cHaha, my Black Heaven Sect will usher in an era of endless glory!\u201d1On the fourth floor of the library.Chu Kuangren was constantly learning and mastering the supreme techniques and the other sword Dao techniques while the sword hymn emitting from his body was getting more intense.He was sitting by the window, flipping through the classics with serenity while the sun shone on his body, as if covering him with a golden gauze.Coupled with his divine aura, handsome face, and the sword rhyme about him, Chu Kuangren seemed immortal.Tens of thousands of disciples outside the library watched that scene in front of them. They were all amazed and felt that Chu Kuangren was beyond human.At this moment, some people actually believed that he was a deity.A high-level female elder looked at Chu Kuangren with a pair of beautiful eyes. \u201cThis person is both too diving and devilish at the same time.\u201d3Beside, Honorable Xuan Qi laughed. \u201cElder Ruyan, you seem to be excited, do you want to try it?\u201d\u201cIf I were a thousand years younger, I would definitely would, unfortunately, however, I\u2019m already an old woman and I\u2019m no longer the same as before.\u201d Elder Ruyan touched her fair and flawless cheeks and said with emotion.Honorable Xuan Qi rolled his eyes. \u201cElder Ruyan, you\u2019re barely more than one thousand six hundred years old. In the realm of Honorables, you are considered young. It is probably not a problem to live for several thousand years more.\u201d3Ruyan shook his head. \u201cI feel that my potential has been exhausted. If the fates do not will it, I am afraid that it will be difficult to move forward in this life. But Chu Kuangren is different, he is a Supreme Daoist Physique with age-old talent. It might be possible for him to be supreme within a hundred years and be on the Emperor\u2019s throne within a thousand!\u201cCompared to that, I\u2019m a mere side character. I am not qualified to stand with him and I\u2019m aware of that.\u201d8\u201cHey, that\u2019s not true, you are an Honorable. Even if you\u2019re not his wife, you could still be Kuangren\u2019s concubine.\u201d\u201cDamn you, I\u2019m not shameless.\u201dElder Ruyan smiled and cursed.The two joked but their spiritual thoughts surrounded the area to protect Chu Kuangren. Neither of them dared to be careless.Time flew by and another two days passed.Chu Kuangren had almost finished flipping through the supreme techniques but he still had not come out of the state of Dao enlightenment.In the past few days, in addition to learning the sword Dao methods in the library, he had not forgotten his once-per-day lucky draw.The morning sun rose and a brand new day arrived.Chu Kuangren looked at the Fantasy Roulette that only he could see and muttered \u2018lucky draw\u2019, and the roulette instantly started to turn quickly.\u201cCongratulations to the host for drawing a Golden Dao Enlightenment Card.\u201dHuh?Chu Kuangren said softly in his heart, \u2018enlightenment card?\u2019This was the first time he had drawn a Gold-grade item from the lucky draw, and he was now in a state of Dao enlightenment. He was pleasantly surprised that he would draw a Dao Enlightenment Card right at this moment.An Enlightenment card, as the name suggested, was a card that allowed people to enter the state of Dao enlightenment. It had the same effect as the Nascent Soul cultivation base experience card drawn before, and both had time-limits.\u201cI am now in the state of Dao enlightenment. What would happen if I use this enlightenment card again?\u201d Chu Kuangren thought.The state of Dao enlightenment was rare. After this time, he did not know when he would be able to be in the state of Dao enlightenment by himself again.\u201cWell, nothing to lose!\u201dChu Kuangren thought to himself and then used the enlightenment card.In a blink of an eye, his mind shook, as if his skull was split open and ice water was poured into it.Immediately afterward, Chu Kuangren just felt that his head was clearer than ever before, and countless thoughts and feelings poured in.This was the state of Dao enlightenment plus the usage of the Golden Dao Enlightenment Card. At this moment, Chu Kuangren had an unprecedentedly clear understanding of the Dao, and countless lines seemed to emerge in front of him\u2026 All within reach!He took advantage of this state to master all the remaining supreme techniques on the fourth floor one by one!Outside the library, Honorable Xuan Qi and others looked at each other.\u201cAm I hallucinating? His enlightenment of the supreme methods became faster!\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s not a hallucination, his enlightenment of the supreme techniques has indeed become faster, and it\u2019s just a little bit faster!\u201d\u201cGosh, what\u2019s happening?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Comprehending the supreme technique became as easy as having a meal. This scene frightened the Honorable Xuan Qi as well as the others.\u201cThis, this is quite frightening, isn\u2019t it!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. What on earth is going on?\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi and the others looked at each other while wondering what happened.However, the state of Dao enlightenment was something that could be encountered but could not be sought. It was a mysterious state. Even if it led to some strange occurrences, it was to be expected so they did not give much thought to it.At this time, Chu Kuangren had arrived on the fifth floor of the library.The fifth floor was the highest floor of the library and was the foundation of Black Heaven Sect. It had more than a dozen top-notch cultivation techniques.Every section was filled with the highest tier supreme techniques!They were only slightly inferior to the Trio Sage Technique.2Different from the fourth floor, the dozens of supreme techniques on the fifth level were all engraved on stone tablets. Some were palm prints, some were sword marks, and some were mysterious talismans.Every stone tablet had a Dao hymn to it as if it was explaining the principles of Dao.If one did not have a deep cultivation base or some kind of extraordinary talent, it would be impossible to comprehend anything from these stone tablets.However, when Chu Kuangren glanced over, countless mysteries revealed themselves in his mind, and he absorbed them one by one. Even if it was about sword Dao techniques, he could quickly understand and master it.1The state of Dao enlightenment coupled with the enlightenment card was too terrifying.There were seventeen top-notch supreme techniques on the fifth floor, of which five were sword Dao, each enigmatic in its own right.Chu Kuangren walked to one of the stone tablets, and on it was a supreme technique \u2018Dragon Tiger Sword Art\u2019 which was extremely profound.Even if it were Nangong Huang and Murong Xuan, it would take at least a few months for prodigies like them to make even a little progress.Nevertheless, Chu Kuangren mastered it after looking at it for a while.1He looked at another stone tablet.In only a short while, Chu Kuangren completely mastered the several sword Dao techniques on the fifth floor. At this time, the sword hymn emitting from his body was extremely intense, and he resembled a sword deity from a distance.\u201cI have mastered all the sword Dao methods in the library, both the top-grade methods and the supreme methods, but why do I still have a sense of emptiness in my heart? There are tens of thousands of sword Dao methods, which one should I use?\u201dChu Kuangren sat cross-legged on the spot, with a touch of confusion in his eyes.The various sword Dao techniques that he had mastered in the library were constantly appearing in his mind. There were various methods and supreme techniques and the sword rhyme on his body changed with it.Boom!Suddenly a stream sword light covered and erupted from Chu Kuangren\u2019s body.Within the ray of sword light was a gigantic, green dragon flaring its teeth and stretching its claws. It was so powerful that countless disciples outside the library exclaimed involuntarily.\u201cThis is the supreme technique, Heaven-Defying Azure Dragon Sword Art!\u201d\u201cWhy did he suddenly use his sword skills?\u201d\u201cNo, this is not his doing, but the Dao hymn in his body manifesting itself naturally. What is he doing?\u201d1While everyone was caught in a commotion, Chu Kuangren\u2019s sword hymn changed again. Within the sword light, a golden sun emerged and began rising in the air!The library was filled with sunlight, and the surrounding air became extremely hot.\u201cThis is the supreme technique, Heavenly Sun Sword Art!\u201dDaoist Murong Xuan\u2019s pupils constricted slightly.He was a practitioner of the Heavenly Sun Sword Art, and he was one of the people that were most familiar with this technique.Then, there was another crash.There were countless streams of sword qi were condensing in the sky, turning into a silver-white waterfall.\u201cSupreme technique, Heaven Waterfall Sword Art!\u201dNangong Huang, who practiced the Heavenly Waterfall Sword Art, was equally stunned.However, it was not over yet.As Chu Kuangren\u2019s sword rhyme continued to evolve, the sky above the library transformed into various types of sword Dao techniques.Azure dragons flying in the sky, cliff-hanging waterfalls, sword qi condensing into an enormous mountain, a dragon and a tiger fighting in the air, sudden storms sweeping the sky, and also sword qi that was like a downpour\u2026\u201cSupreme technique, Dragon Tiger Sword Art!\u201d\u201cThe top-grade method, Thunderstorm Thirteen Sword!\u201d\u201cSupreme technique, Single Zhenyue Sword!\u201d\u201cThis is the supreme technique River Flowing Into The Ocean!\u201d\u201cOh my god, so many sword Dao techniques And each of them performed to perfection, and the mysteries within have been fully revealed to him.\u201dLooking at the various visions that appeared one after another over the library, countless disciples exclaimed one after another in shock.Even the high-level officials such as Honorable Xuan Qi were stunned.\u201cHe has mastered all the sword Dao techniques in the library!\u201d\u201cThe leader is demonstrating tens of thousands of sword Dao by himself! This kind of behavior is like a Sage\u2019s preaching, it\u2019s too powerful.\u201d\u201cDisciples, please watch with all your heart and try to understand the mysteries within these techniques.\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi suddenly said to the disciples behind him.Some of the disciples were already trying to grasp the secrets of various sword Dao methods, and gradually they were all hypnotized by it.Some disciples confirmed what they have learned and strive for perfection.Some disciples were ecstatic because they finally understood some techniques.There were also slower disciples who seemed to have caught something, but it passed by in a flash, and they were left scratching their heads.3Honorable Xuan Qi stared at the handlers in the library with a stern look in his eyes, \u201cDemonstrating tens of thousands of sword Dao is like a Sage preaching, but Kuangren\u2019s cultivation is still shallow, how did he do it? What is he actually doing?\u201dChu Kuangren was only in the Golden Core Realm and was still far away from being a Sage, but here he was, replicating what a Sage could do.This kind of thing only appeared in fantasies.2Chu Kuangren was oblivious to what was happening outside. He still sat cross-legged without moving, and the various sword Dao techniques he mastered before continue to appear in his mind, allowing his whole body to evolve.Gradually, a kind of enlightenment suddenly emerged in his heart.\u201cThe sword is a murderous soldier!\u201d\u201cSword Dao is the way to attack!\u201d\u201cThere are thousands of sword Dao techniques in the world, but no matter how mysterious and secretive they were, the reason for wielding a sword is to kill the enemy, no matter how fancy the process was, the way of the sword is to attack\u2026\u201d4Chu Kuangren\u2019s mind was opened.The countless sword Dao techniques that he had mastered in his mind seemed to be coming together, and the essence of each technique was gradually exposed before his eyes.1The gorgeous light eventually faded away, leaving behind only the purest method of attack!These moves were constantly evolving in his mind.In the end, there was only one move left.This move was extremely simple.It was so simple that it could not even be called a move.This move merely consisted of two moves: drawing and sheathing the sword.4At this time, in the outside world.The various illusions of sword Dao techniques above the library suddenly disappeared and countless disciples came back to their senses, even while some had yet to finish analyzing their contents.\u201cWhy has it disappeared?\u201d\u201cI was almost able to ascend to the next realm.\u201d\u201cNo, look\u2026\u201dThe illusions disappeared, but a large number of Dao hymns still hovered over the library for a long time. These rhymes rolled like clouds and then condensed into a huge white-robed figure holding a long sword.This figure looked exactly like Chu Kuangren.The figure suddenly and quickly unsheathed his sword.One simple strike.Even an ordinary person who had never practiced sword skills could do a good job by picking up a dead branch.Nonetheless, from this strike, countless disciples saw what could only be described as sword Dao\u201ds purest means of attack! It was the most amazing sword Dao technique in the world!Honorable Xuan Qi could not help but cry out, \u201cSage Ruler Technique!\u201d1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Countless disciples felt this sword intent, even Daoists felt it.Honorable Xuan Qi exclaimed on the spot, \u201cA Sage Ruler Technique!\u201d1The other high-level Daoists were also shocked, and then, a Dao hymn flowed through the air with a divine echo in the sky!A large volume of air gushed out, forming a blossoming golden lotus!\u201cThis is\u2026 The sound of Dao! And look at that blossoming golden lotus!\u201d\u201cThis kind of vision can only appear when a cultivator breaks through and becomes a Sage, or when something related to the Sage Dao occurs.\u201d\u201cSage Ruler Technique? Did the leader create a type of Sage Ruler Technique?!\u201d\u201cOrdinary Sage techniques will never have this kind of terrifying sword intent and Dao hymn, this, this is definitely\u2026 A Sage Ruler Technique!\u201dWhen the three words were said, everyone was shocked.After the last emperor in ancient times fell, the Firmament Star entered an era known as the fallen era.From ancient times to the present, no emperor had been born, and the Sage Ruler was the highest form of existence. To find a Sage Ruler in the entirety of the Firmament Star was a rarity in itself.Naturally, there were not many Sage Ruler Techniques.There was no Sage Ruler Technique in the Black Heaven Sect sage orthodoxy!However, Chu Kuangren was now in front of them, forcibly creating a Sage Ruler Technique that could crush all the world\u2019s Sage Ruler Technique!\u201cFrom ancient times to the present, even with a Supreme Daoist Physique, I\u2019ve never heard of anyone who has created a Sage Ruler Technique while still in the Golden Core Realm!\u201d\u201cThis is terrifying!\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi looked at the Chu Kuangren in the library in horror.He thought that he had looked up to Chu Kuangren as much as he could, but the other party has repeatedly proven that he could still go beyond his expectations.\u201cHe will not falter. The emperor\u2019s throne belongs to Black Heaven Sect!\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi said excitedly.He was convinced that there were absolutely no prodigies in the Firmament Star who could create a Sage Ruler Technique while still in the Golden Core Realm,\u00a0but Chu Kuangren could1!Based on this, Chu Kuangren far surpassed the rest of the prodigies!\u201cMaster, please get me a Dao stele.\u201dChu Kuangren suddenly said.Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s eyes lit up and he hurriedly told someone to get a Dao stele.A Dao stele was made of a peculiar stone and was used to record Dao hymns. Some methods were too sophisticated to record with words or ordinary characters, so Dao hymns were injected directly into it.For example, those supreme techniques on the library\u2019s fifth floor were recorded in this way for Black Heaven Sect.Soon, a black Dao stele was transported to the door of the library, and Chu Kuangren summoned Descendant Self from within his body.With the sword in his hand, Chu Kuangren closed his eyes slightly and stood silently for a while, then he lifted his sword and struck the stele.A ray of sword light flashed brightly and fell on the stele.The initially empty stele was marked with a slash more than a foot deep, and a terrifying Dao hymn spewed out from the sword mark, covering the entire stele in the blink of an eye.\u201cHe has inserted the Sage Ruler Technique into the stele, so everyone can use the stele to understand the Sage Ruler Technique!\u201d6The beautiful eyes of Elder Ruyan glowed with brilliance.The others also looked at Chu Kuangren with excitement.Chu Kuangren\u2019s move was extremely significant for the entirety of\u00a0Black Heaven Sect, it meant that Black Heaven Sect would have its own Sage Ruler Technique!Anyone would be able to comprehend the Sage Ruler Technique and master it. Members of Black Heaven Sect who mastered the Holy King\u2019s Law would have an increase in their foundations and strength significantly!2\u201cRighteous leader!!\u201dAn elder said loudly.The rest of the disciples completely agreed with Chu Kuangren at that moment and admired him from the bottom of their hearts without any objection.\u201cRighteous leader!!\u201d\u201cRighteous leader!!\u201dAll the disciples shouted in unison and their voices threatened to shake the sky.Chu Kuangren, who had done all this, gradually broke away from the state of Dao enlightenment, and the effect of the enlightenment card had also disappeared.However, the Sage Ruler Technique that he created by referencing thousands of sword techniques was etched in his mind.Various visions disappeared one after another. After calming down, Chu Kuangren walked out of the library and came to Honorable Xuan Qi and the others. He bowed slightly and said, \u201cGreetings, Master and Elders.\u201d\u201cKuangren, you are not the only benefactor of your enlightenment, Black Heaven Sect owes you a great debt as well!\u201d Honorable Xuan Qi was very excited and looked at Chu Kuangren admiringly.\u201cSome slight gains,\u201d Chu Kuangren said modestly.Hearing this, everyone could not help but roll their eyes.For crying out loud, he had created a Sage Ruler Technique, how could that be considered a small gain?Honorable Xuan Qi said, \u201cBy the way, Kuangren, you have just created this Sage Ruler Technique, what name do you want to give it?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have a name for it yet, why don\u2019t you give it a name?\u201dChu Kuangren said after thinking for a while.It was a privilege to give a name to the Sage Ruler Technique. The other honorable Daoists did not have this treatment because they could not create the Sage Ruler Technique.Moreover, how could the creator of the Sage Ruler Technique let others name it?Only Chu Kuangren, the freak who created the Sage Ruler Technique in the Golden Core Realm, could bestow this honor to others.Letting Honorable Xuan Qi name his Sage Ruler Technique was easy because its name was nothing but a string of words for Chu Kuangren. He did not mind using this to enhance the relationship between them.Sure enough, when Honorable Xuan Qi heard this, his eyes brightened and his face flushed with excitement. However, when he remembered that he was in front of his apprentice, he wanted to maintain the dignity of a master, so he restrained his emotions.He said with a serious face, \u201cThis Sage Ruler Technique seems simple. In its essence, it consists only of drawing and sheathing the sword, but this basic move extracts the meaning of fast, accurate, and ruthless swordsmanship to the fullest.In my opinion, it\u2019s better to call it\u2026 Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique!\u201d5Chu Kuangren nodded slightly when he heard the words, and said, \u201cThen master, according to your words, this Sage Ruler Technique shall be named Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique.\u201dAs soon as the words left his lips, the sky suddenly roared and as if recognizing the name, the stone tablet vibrated Stone chips fell off it, revealing the words \u2018Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique\u2019.\u201cIt\u2019s recognized by the Dao stele!\u201d\u201cFrom now on, this method will be called Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique!\u201d\u201cHaha, with this Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique, Black Heaven Sect\u2019s foundation will be raised to a higher level, and in time, we will be crowned Emperors of the Azure Dragon Domain!\u201dNext, Honorable Xuan Qi placed the stone tablet with the engraving of Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique on the fifth floor of the library, under strict supervision.Chu Kuangren also left the library and returned to Towering Heaven Palace.In the Dao Palace, Lil Bing had long heard that Chu Kuangren had created a Sage Ruler Technique in the library and she was full of praise.In the entire Black Heaven Sect, everyone from the top elders to the outer disciples were all talking about Chu Kuangren.\u201cDid you hear about Elder Senior Brother creating the Sage Ruler Technique in the library? There was a sound of the Dao and also the golden lotus in the ground, it was simply magical!\u201d\u201cI was at the scene, it was amazing.\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother is really divine, he has been our Elder Senior Brother for just a short period of time and now he has created a Sage Ruler Technique!\u201d\u201cUnbelievable, in my opinion, as far as talent is concerned, in the entire Azure Dragon Domain, no, no young person in the entire Firmament Star!\u201d\u201cNot only talent, as far as looks are concerned, no one can replace in the entire Firmament Star. That face of his is just too beautiful.\u201d1 1Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20: Prince Gu Changge, Unrivaled In His GenerationAt the Towering Heaven Palace.In the courtyard, Chu Kuangren was lying on a deck chair.Next to him, Lil Bing was holding a plate of grapes, feeding him from time to time. Beside was Lan Yu dressed in a blue and white skirt, sitting cross-legged with a dark guqin in front of her.With each movement of her fingers, Lan Yu played a beautiful melody.\u201cAh\u2026\u201dChu Kuangren opened his mouth to take a grape that Lil Bing fed him, and listened to the melody of the guqin played by Lan Yu, squinting his eyes with a pleasant expression.Lil Bing was peeling grapes next to him, watching Chu Kuangren\u2019s face up close, and she had a slight blush and an unspeakable joy.The outside world was eager for him, and there were countless women who wanted to see him, while here she was, feeding him by herself.Thinking about it, she felt very happy.One song ended.Lan Yu smiled warmly. \u201cWhat else do you want to hear?\u201dIn addition to being a formidable warrior, she was also proficient in music. Chu Kuangren had only recently discovered this.Lan Yu really almost seemed too good to be true.She was beautiful, powerful, and obedient to Chu Kuangren.\u201cEnough, if I continue to be like this, I won\u2019t be able to climb out from this place.\u201d Chu Kuangren shook his head and smiled.He stretched, \u201cI\u2019m going for cultivation practice.\u201dIt had been nearly a month since he created the Sage Ruler Technique and his cultivation base had made great progress. From the first time he entered the Golden Core Realm until the current completion of it, he was only one step away from the Nascent Soul Realm.Also within this month, Chu Kuangren had extracted a lot of things from the Fantasy Roulette, but most of them were black iron and silver grade. Except for a few pieces, the rest were of no use to him.Such as some medicinal pills, cultivation methods, spiritual marrow, and the like. These were all used by him to cultivate Lil Bing, so in this month, besides him, Lil Bing also improved a lot.\u2026In the afternoon, Chu Kuangren had just finished his cultivation practice.Lil Bing told him that Daoists Nan Gonghuang and Murong Xuan were visiting.In the Daoist Palace\u2019s main hall.\u201cElder Senior Brother, you finally came.\u201dMurong Xuan greeted him with an unnatural amount of excitement after seeing Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren\u2019s face changed slightly and he took a step back. The excitement Murong Xuan showed almost made it as if he was looking at his long-lost girlfriend.Did he also attract the men?Murong Xuan stood there and felt a little embarrassed.\u2018Elder Senior Brother, you\u2019re seriously taking a step back?\u2018Such a small action, but why is my heart\u2026\u2019\u201cHey Elder Senior Brother.\u201dNangong Huang gave a small salute. Since being defeated by Chu Kuangren and witnessing the other party\u2019s creation of a Sage Ruler Technique, he now looked up to the other party more and more.He was a little fanboy like everyone else in Black Heaven Sect.\u201cJunior brothers, have a seat.\u201dAfter both of them took a seat, Murong Xuan spoke first, \u201cI\u2019m here because I want to ask your opinion about something.\u201d\u201cOh, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d\u201cHave you heard of\u2026Gu Changge?\u201d\u201cGu Changge?\u201d Chu Kuangren mumbled and seemed to recall some familiarity, then he asked, \u201cThe Qingyun Prince, Gu Changge?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s him,\u201d Nangong Huang said solemnly.In this world of great controversy, all kinds of prodigal talents emerged endlessly, like blooming flowers contending for beauty.Gu Changge was one of the most magnificent flowers among the hundreds of others, and was a supreme prodigy of the world!He was even better than Nangong Huang.Moreover, the power behind the Qingyun Prince was the Qingyun Dynasty, which was also the top sage orthodoxy in the Azure Dragon domain, not weaker than Black Heaven Sect.\u201cWhat about him?\u201dChu Kuangren asked while pondering his newfound information on Gu Changge.\u201cGu Changge left the Qingyun dynasty capital half a month ago. In the name of socializing, he went all the way through Ziyang Valley, Wanfa Sect, Lingxu Sect and the Five Elements Sect which are the four great sage orthodoxies, and consecutively defeated eight Daoists!\u201dMurong Xuan said slowly, his tone was solemn.Hearing this, Chu Kuangren still did not know the purpose of these two visitors, \u201cAre you afraid that he will also challenge Black Heaven Sect?\u201d\u201cHe will definitely come here for a challenge,\u201d Nangong Huang said.\u201cHe\u2019s shaping the \u2018Invincible Heart\u2019!\u201d\u201cNot bad,\u201d Nangong Huang continued, \u201cA few years ago, the divine predictor once said that the road to the emperor\u2019s throne of this world would be reopened, and all the prodigies will fight for it. Gu Changge defeated the Daoists to create the \u2018Invincible Heart\u2019 and wanted to use this to ascend the emperor\u2019s throne!\u201d\u201cOnly by defeating him can this process be disrupted. Otherwise, when his \u2018Invincible Heart\u2019 is completed, I\u2019m afraid that it will be difficult for someone to compete with him again!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just not easy to defeat him. This person is incomparable among the younger generation and has few rivals. The stronger ones from the older generation are not easy to attack. According to rumors, he has a protector who is in the honorable realm. Even if someone wants to attack him secretly, it\u2019s impossible.\u201dNangong Huang and Murong Xuan talked about the matter while Chu Kuangren listened.\u201cElder Senior Brother, Gu Changge\u2019s strength is amazing. He has defeated eight Daoists in a row. Among them were people who had the same combat power as I do, therefore out of all the Daoists in Black Heaven Sect, only you can defeat this person.\u201dNangong Huang looked at Chu Kuangren with piercing eyes.\u201cWhat\u2019s his cultivation base?\u201cComplete Nascent Soul, no, maybe Half Step!\u201dNangong Huang paused and said.What?Half Step?Chu Kuangren was inevitably a little nervous.He was only a complete Golden Core, and had not reached Nascent Soul cultivation base yet. The last time he was able to suppress Nangong Huang because of the cultivation base experience card.What would happen if he used the complete Golder Core to duel with a Half-Step Nascent Soul cultivation base?This person was a peerless prodigy!It was estimated that this person was more powerful than other cultivators at Half-Step Nascent Soul.It did not feel right.To the hopeful eyes of the two junior brothers Murong Xuan and Nangong Huang, he could not show his timidity as an Elder Senior Brother.\u201cI understand.\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s eyes were calm and his tone was calm.Nangong Huang and the two looked at each other, and immediately felt a wave of reassurance. Since the Elder Senior Brother was so calm, he must be confident.The two left Daoist Palace in peace.\u201cNangong, what do you think of the chances of winning for Elder Senior Brother against Gu Changge?\u201d Murong Xuan asked curiously outside the Daoist Palace.Nangong Huang paused and said softly, \u201cHighly likely!\u201d\u201cYou have so much confidence in Elder Senior Brother.\u201dMurong Xuan was a little surprised.Although he believed in Chu Kuangren, Gu Changge was not just any opponent. He had defeated eight consecutive Daoists, and was already invincible in his generation!He dared not say that Chu Kuangren had a very good chance of winning.\u201cElder Senior Brother can suppress me by just raising his hands, and his combat power is unfathomable, plus, couldn\u2019t you read his attitude just now? It\u2019s obvious that Gu Changge was not his concern.\u201dNangong Huang praised Chu Kuangren with respect.Murong Xuan heard these words, and the more he thought about it, the more he felt that they were reasonable, so he nodded and said, \u201cYou are right, if he didn\u2019t have the confidence to win, how could he have been so calm? Our Elder Senior Brother is undisputed!\u201d\u201cI think it\u2019s more than that. Elder Senior Brother can create his own Sage Ruler Technique. How many people in this world can do that? It\u2019s terrifying.\u201dThe two speculated about Chu Kuangren\u2019s true ability, and the more they guessed, the more they felt that he was unpredictable, and the awe in their hearts kept increasing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21: Nothing To Fear About Gu Changge, Heaven Spiritual Marrow\u201cHow was it? What did the Daoist say?\u201dJun Yi, Zhuo Han, and the other Daoists asked repeatedly when they saw Murong Xuan and Nangong Huang return from Towering Heaven Palace. The duo had visited in hopes of learning how to defeat Gu Changge.\u201cElder Senior Brother said that\u2026 There\u2019s nothing to fear about Gu Changge!\u201dJun Yi and the group were surprised.After all, it was widely known that Gu Changge had already defeated eight Daoists from four sage orthodoxies. From the perspective of his peers, he was truly unrivaled in his generation.Yet, Chu Kuangren did not think there was anything to be afraid of about Gu Changge.This came as a shocking revelation to the group.Soon, Zhuo Han burst into laughter and said, \u201cHow typical of our Elder Senior Brother. While Gu Changge has shocked the entire Azure Dragon Domain with his victory over the eight Daoists, it is nothing to our Elder Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cSuch confidence!\u201d\u201cNot bad at all. Elder Senior Brother has always been this fearless!\u201dSoon, words began to spread in Black Heaven Sect that someone thought there was nothing to fear about Gu Changge. Most of the disciples knew that these words had come from Chu Kuangren himself.Gu Changge had always wanted to create the Heart of Invincibility. It was this reason that he had went on his crusade to defeat the eight Daoists. As a result, many disciples had felt uneasy knowing that it was a matter of time before Gu Changge would come to Black Heaven Sect.However, Chu Kuangren\u2019s remark had provided much relief to many within the sect.\u201cElder Senior Brother is indeed formidable. Only people at his level would dare utter such words.\u201d\u201cEven after Gu Changge had single-handedly defeated the Daoists from four sage orthodoxies, it doesn\u2019t faze our Elder Senior Brother at all.\u201d\u201cAmazing!\u201d\u201cI would love to see how Elder Senior Brother defeats Gu Changge.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve become a huge fan of Elder Senior Brother.\u201dSoon, people were enthusiastically discussing this news throughout the entire Black Heaven Sect.The news had even spread to the elders. Elder Ruyan commended, \u201cHe is my lead disciple indeed, what formidable courage!\u201dThe Honorable Xuan Qi uttered with pride, \u201cMy disciple, Kuangren, possesses the might of an emperor. Who\u2019s Gu Changge to think he deserves to be compared?\u201dThe elders would have probably not trusted Kuangren this much if it was in the past.However, times had changed.Ever since Kuangren created the Sage Ruler Technique in the library, not only had he gained unprecedented admiration from his fellow disciples, but he had also impressed the elders so much that they had branded him to be unrivaled amongst his peers.As a result, his words carried much credibility.\u201cMaster, aside from other disciples, many elders are pledging their full support for you as well. You must defeat Gu Changge!\u201dLil Bing clenched her fists as she cheered for Chu Kuangren.After hearing everything that unfolded, Chu Kuangren merely reacted in confusion.\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to fear about Gu Changge?\u201d\u2018Since when have I ever spoken such words?\u2019, he thought.What were Murong Xuan and Nangong Huang drunk on?It was fine if it were just a few disciples getting caught in a rumor. However, even the elders were now getting excited and complimenting Chu Kuangren excessively. Chu Kuangren helplessly buried his face into his hands.After all, his cultivation level was merely in the Golden Core Realm!\u201cLil Bing, you should leave first.\u201dChu Kuangren gestured her away. He needed some quiet space to think alone.\u201cUnderstood, Master. It\u2019s natural that you prefer to replenish and conserve your energy to be in the best form when facing Gu Changge. Rest assured that I won\u2019t allow anyone to intrude your privacy,\u201d said Lil Bing.She then proceeded to exit the room, but not before giving Chu Kuangren one last gesture of encouragement.Chu Kuangren helplessly sighed as he sat on his bed and thought \u2018These fellas sure have some wild imaginations, why don\u2019t they consider writing a novel?\u2019He summoned the Fantasy Roulette and started spinning for the daily prize.\u201cCongratulations, Host! You have won a Gold Item \u2013 a jar of Heaven Spiritual Marrow!\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s eyes lit up. \u2018Another Gold Item, and this time it\u2019s Heavenly Essence! Looks like my luck has been decent today!\u201dSpiritual marrow was a form of liquid that was rich in spiritual qi. It was an object that was several grades higher than objects like a soul stone. Spiritual marrow was categorized into four tiers \u2013 Heaven, Earth, Dark, and Yellow.Heaven Spiritual Marrow belonged to the highest tier of its kind. It was used to improve one\u2019s cultivation base, strengthen their spiritual power, and rejuvenate their body.Many cultivators would have fought fiercely just for a single drop of Heaven Spiritual Marrow. Yet, Chu Kuangren now had an entire jar of it in his possession!\u201cAccept Heaven Spiritual Marrow,\u201d Chu Kuangren said.Immediately, a green jar the size of a palm appeared in Chu Kuangren\u2019s hands. It contained the golden-colored Heaven Spiritual Marrows.\u201cWith the help of the Heaven Spiritual Marrow, I can surely reach the Nascent Soul Realm much quicker. Then, defeating Gu Changge should then be possible.\u201dChu Kuangren muttered.With that, he immediately isolated himself and started cultivating.\u2026Meanwhile, in the outside world.The entire Azure Dragon Domain was shaken by the mere mention of Gu Changge\u2019s name.Ever since Gu Changge left the capital city and defeated eight Daoists from the four greatest sage orthodoxies, words had spread throughout the domain and caused panic among countless cultivators.There were eight sage orthodoxies in Azure Dragon Domain.The Royal Azure Dynasty, Zhiyang Valley, Dharma Sect, Taixu Temple, Serene Wisdom Sect, Five Ways Sect, Thunder Temple, School of White Lotus, and Black Heaven Sect.Not counting the Royal Azure Dynasty, the subsequent four sage orthodoxies had been challenged and defeated by Gu Changge.All eyes were now on the remaining three sage orthodoxies. Everyone was curious about whether there was someone capable enough to break Gu Changge\u2019s win streaks. Otherwise, he would inevitably own the Heart of Invincibility!On the peak of a majestic mountain, thick fog filled the atmosphere.Within that fog laid several building structures that were erected closely together. Upon closer inspection, one would observe that most of these structures were supporting an enormous Buddha statue.This was a temple.It was the largest temple in the kingdom. Very few would dare provoke the people who resided in this territory.It belonged to one of the sage orthodoxies, the Thunder Temple.On that day, the bell tolled and echoed throughout the entire temple.A luxurious carriage towed by six sturdy houses covered in gold-plated armor had arrived and parked itself at the front gate of the Thunder Temple.As the carriage door opened, a handsome man dressed in golden robes stepped out. The man gazed intently at the front gate of the Thunder Temple.The man was none other than the notorious Gu Changge!\u201cThunder Temple, I have arrived.\u201dGu Changge muttered.He emitted a provocative aura as the spiritual power in his body began to burst aggressively. One could faintly hear the roar of a dragon if one stood close enough to him.\u201cOnce I defeat the Thunder Temple, School of White Lotus, and the Black Heaven Sect, I shall finally forge the Heart of Invincibility!\u201d\u201cThe path to the throne shall be mine!\u201dGu Changge was overjoyed.\u201cDo not celebrate too early, my Crown Prince.\u201dA frail voice emerged from within the thin air as it cautioned Gu Changge, \u201cThere are many hidden challenges within these sage orthodoxies. Just a few days ago, a Supreme Daoist Physique had been birthed in Black Heaven Sect, which is concerning.\u201d\u201cA Supreme Daoist Physique? Indeed, I did sense its presence a few days ago. After I\u2019m finished with Thunder Temple and the School of White Lotus, I shall personally head to Black Heaven Sect and teach whoever\u2019s behind that a valuable lesson!\u201dThen, he immediately turned towards Thunder Temple and loudly announced his presence, \u201cI am here to pay a visit! Elder monks of this place, please show yourself!\u201dIt was difficult to avoid that confrontation.The next day, with the departure of the golden carriage, words began to spread that two Daoists had lost to Gu Changge.It had not even been three days since before the School of White Lotus had fallen to Gu Changge\u2019s hands as well.It did not take long before Gu Changge\u2019s reputation reached its peak.Out of eight sage orthodoxies, six had crumbled in defeat to the Crown Prince. It had also signified that these orthodoxies were deemed inferior to the Royal Azure Dynasty.Now, all eyes were on the last standing orthodoxy, the Black Heaven Sect.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22: Defeating Nangong Huang In Three Moves, Gu Changge Is Terrifying\u201cHe\u2019s undefeatable! Gu Changge is becoming truly unrivaled in this world!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true! The Daoists from eight major sage orthodoxies have now fallen to the same person. In other words, it meant these orthodoxies are incomparable against the Royal Azure Dynasty. The leaders of these orthodoxies must be mad right now.\u201d\u201cGu Changge is way too strong.\u201d\u201cAll that\u2019s left is the Black Heaven Sect now.\u201d\u201cThe other six orthodoxies have lost, I don\u2019t think the Black Heaven Sect would stand a chance.\u201dCountless cultivators across the Azure Dragon Domain were shocked by Gu Changge\u2019s progress.They did not expect Gu Changge to be this ambitious.The sage orthodoxies were not only considered influential in the Azure Dragon Domain, but they were also cultivation powerhouses throughout Firmament Star. Naturally, the Daoists that these orthodoxies nurtured were considered as some of Firmament Star\u2019s finest prodigies!Yet, these geniuses were all losing to the same person!Gu Changge\u2019s Poise of Invincibility had surely shocked everyone across the world.\u2026In Black Heaven Sect, Nangong Huang and a few Daoists gathered closely in a circle.After getting wind of Gu Changge\u2019s latest move, they, too, were shocked by his advancement.\u201cWhen do you guys think Elder Senior Brother will exit his room?\u201dMurong Xuan said concerningly.Ever since their last visit to Chu Kuangren, he had since isolated himself in his room and had not made an appearance since.\u201cJudging by Gu Changge\u2019s route, it\u2019s estimated that he\u2019ll be arriving today. What if Elder Senior Brother still hasn\u2019t exited his room by then?\u201d Zhuo Han said. He was worried too.Very few could go up against Gu Changge\u2019s ability. In Zhuo Han\u2019s opinion, it seemed that only Chu Kuangren would be capable enough to put on a fight in the entire Black Heaven Sect.If Chu Kuangren had not completed his meditation by the time Gu Changge arrived, none of the remaining disciples could defend against him.\u201cIf Elder Senior Brother isn\u2019t done by then, let me personally test Gu Changge\u2019s strengths,\u201d Nangong Huang suggested.\u201cSounds good. That way, Elder Senior Brother will have a better grasp of Gu Changge\u2019s ability and he\u2019ll stand a better chance against him.\u201dIn the midst of their discussions, the clouds above the Black Heaven Sect suddenly split across the sky. A bright ray shined across the atmosphere, instantly dying the clouds in shades of gold.As the clouds split apart, a horse carriage towed by six sturdy horses descended from the sky and landed at the gates of Black Heaven Sect.The sudden movement had attracted a substantial amount of attention from the crowd nearby.\u201cCome look, someone\u2019s here.\u201d\u201cThe horses are dressed in gold-plated armor, these obviously belong to the noble family of the Royal Azure Dynasty! To be influential enough to be carried by six horses\u2026 it must be Gu Changge! The Crown Prince of the Royal Azure Dynasty is here!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s finally arrived.\u201d\u201cFinally, he\u2019s here for us, the Black Heaven Sect.\u201dThe disciples of the Black Heaven Sect were astounded.The Daoists who were gathering together had shifted their attention towards the gate as well. Nangong Huang said faintly, \u201cLet\u2019s go and greet him.\u201dOutside the gate of Black Heaven Sect, Gu Changge slowly exited his carriage.The disciples were visibly stern in their expressions. They had expressed the utmost caution against their guest.Gu Changge only needed to stare at these people before a terrifying aura soon clouded the atmosphere. The crowd immediately retreated in terror.\u201cHow terrifying!\u201d\u201cI instantly had goosebumps the second he stared at me!\u201d\u201cIs this the infamous Gu Changge?!\u201dHaving defeated six orthodoxies thus far in his journey, his Poise of Invincibility had been accumulated up to an unprecedented level.How could a normal disciple even stand a chance against that level of momentum?A slight gaze was enough to intimidate a crowd.\u201cI have come to visit. May the elders of this sect please present themselves!\u201dGu Changge loudly announced.His voice was so profound it echoed throughout the entire Black Heaven Sect.\u201cWe are aware of your intentions in coming here. Let\u2019s cut the nonsense. You\u2019re seeking for a challenge, and we shall give you one,\u201d said Honourable Xuan Qi.There was no need for nonsense nor unnecessary politeness.After all, it was obvious that their guest had come to provoke the sect, why should anyone treat him properly?\u201cHehe, that\u2019s great. I\u2019ve heard that a few days ago a Supreme Daoist Physique had been birthed in Black Heaven Sect, is he keen on accepting my challenge?\u201d asked Gu Changge.Swish\u2026At that instance, an ancient longsword launched across the air and landed precisely in front of the ground where Gu Changge was standing.A powerful wave of sword intent instantly erupted from the sword!\u201cOh, a sacred weapon.\u201dGu Changge was not surprised at all. After all, it was not uncommon for an orthodox with a fairly long historical lineage to have a few of those in their possession.Gu Changge was more interested in whoever was wielding that weapon.He lifted his head and saw an approaching Nangong Huang. He was dressed in purple robes and he said softly, \u201cElder Senior Brother is meditating. If you want to fight him, you\u2019ll have to get through me first.\u201dNangong Huang\u2019s sword intent was flowing richly around his body, his spiritual power was erupting, and his Nascent Soul combat poise was palpable. As his eyes glowed with power, he had achieved a frightening level of momentum.He had the poise of a martial arts genius.Having the Yin Yang God-eye and being one of the top geniuses, it was natural that Nangong Huang possessed a certain amount of pride. Although he knew that he was likely no match against Gu Changge, Nangong Huang had still wanted a proper sparring match with him to gauge his ability.\u201cNangong Huang, I\u2019ve heard of you before. You\u2019re the strongest amongst the nine Daoists of Black Heaven Sect. How surprising that you\u2019ve chosen to acknowledge the Supreme Daoist Physique as your Elder Senior Brother. Hehe, I\u2019m more curious about that person now.\u201cWhatever, let\u2019s just get you out of the way first then.\u201dGu Changge\u2019s bodily momentum instantly exploded.An overwhelming level of crushing Intent surged along with his Poise of Invincibility and dissipated into all directions. Gu Changge\u2019s spiritual power began to flow around his body and it gradually morphed into a giant golden dragon, letting out a thunderous roar that shook his surroundings.The surrounding disciples could not help but retreated a few steps back.\u201cSuch crushing spiritual power!\u201d\u201cHe is the Crown Prince of Royal Azure Dynasty indeed!\u201d\u201cLegend has it that there exists a Sage Technique within the Royal Azure Dynastic called the True Dragon Evocation Technique. It allows a person to cultivate immensely crushing dragon qi. This must be the technique that Gu Changge is currently channeling.\u201dThe golden dragon circled around Gu Changge\u2019s physique, its dragon eyes observing its surroundings, seemingly disgusted at all the mortal beings.Nangong Huang had also felt the surging momentum from Gu Changge. He gripped tightly onto his sacred sword and made the first strike as he charged himself full of spiritual power!Like a gushing waterfall, rays of sword intent came rushing down from above!Supreme Technique, Waterfall Sword Art!Gu Changge did not bother to dodge his attack and countered with a punch!The golden dragon qi flowed voraciously, empowered by his boundless crushing Intent.A loud explosion ensued.The sword ray and dragon qi clashed against each other, creating an enormous force that sent waves spreading out from the epicenter. Nan Gonghuang could not withstand the amount of energy released and was forced to retreat.On the other hand, Gu Changge did not move an inch from his initial position!\u201cAgain.\u201dNangong Huang channeled a ray of lights from within and covered his Deep Pool Rainbow Sword with a layer of glowing sword intent.He made another strike with his sword. This time, using the Golden Time Immemorial Light Art and the power of his sacred sword, the sword ray emitted was far more destructive than the previous strike.This time, Gu Changge had finally taken it seriously.\u201cThat\u2019s more like it! Only this deserves to be matched against my next move!\u201cDragon Slaughter Fist, attack!\u201dAs he made his move, the crushing sound of a dragon\u2019s roar echoed throughout the venue.The momentum from his fist transformed into an enormous dragon as a terrifying amount of Daoist rhymes circulated around it. This time, the sword ray was once again shattered by the fist attack of Gu Changge!As Nangong Huang once again retreated, the divine rays that were glowing in his eyes came spewing outwards. It was the source of the power of his Yin Yang God-eye!\u201cHaha, just as I expected.\u201d\u201cDragon Slaughter Fist!\u201dGu Changge made another move with his right fist. It was barely visible that his hand was covered in golden dragon scales. This fist attack packed even more destructive power than before. After shattering the Yin Yang divine ray, the remaining impact from Gu Changge\u2019s attack landed directly onto Nangong Huang.Nangong Huang instantly spitted a mouthful of blood.The impact sent Nangong Huang flying some ten feet away and crushed him against a wall, creating a large crater at the point of impact.All the disciples of Black Heaven Sect were in disbelief at that sight.Three moves!Three moves were all it took to defeat Nangong Huang!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 23": "Chapter 23: Lan Yu Makes An Appearance, Gu Changge Is EnragedNangong Huang slid down the wall as bloodstains still covered his lips. He stood with great difficulty as he observed Gu Changge\u2019s right hand. Before he was flung across the arena, he could have sworn that he saw golden dragon scales manifesting on Gu Changge\u2019s right hand.\u201cI\u2019ve heard that the True Dragon Evocation Technique from the Royal Azure Dynasty could allow one to transform into the Dragon Blood Physique. Looks like your right hand has cultivated the dragon blood!\u201dNangong Huang said solemnly.The Dragon Blood Physique was one of the greatest physiques that existed. Having power that transcended even beyond his Yinyang God-eye, this physique was recognized to be one of the few that could nearly rival a Supreme Daoist Physique. Once fully transformed, even sages had to give way to such immense power!\u201cNot bad.\u201dGu Changge said proudly, \u201cEven if it\u2019s just my right hand, for now, I could still easily defeat a stellar martial art genius like you!\u201dCountless training and cultivation sessions were required in order to transform into the Dragon Blood Physique. However, Gu Changge had merely cultivated the blood channels in his right hand.Even then, it was enough for him to defeat most of his peers with ease.\u201cSenior Brother Gu Changge has lost in just three moves.\u201d\u201cWhere is Elder Senior Brother? We can only rely on him for now.\u201d\u201cGu Changge is terrifying.\u201dThe disciples were once again engaged in discussions, their astonishment was evident.Gu Changge observed the reaction and rested his hands behind his back. He looked upon the crowd and a wave of his crushing aura once again filled the atmosphere. His poise was akin to that of an emperor.\u201cWho else among you still dares to challenge me?\u201dGu Changge scowled at the disciples, his Poise of Immortality once again shook the entire crowd!From a distance, Honourable Xuan Qi and Elder Ruyan were paying close attention to everything that was unfolding.\u201cThis bloke is no ordinary person.\u201d\u201cAgreed. His cultivation level has reached the Half-Paradise Realm at such a young age. Combining that with his Dragon Blood Physique, it was no surprise that he could defeat his peers with such ease.\u201d\u201cHe has already gained the Poise of Invincibility after defeating six sage orthodoxies. I\u2019m afraid if this continues, he could really forge the Heart of Invincibility!\u201dAlthough Honourable Xuan Qi and the group were unhappy with Gu Changge\u2019s provocation, they were still compelled to acknowledge his ability.\u201cSect Leader, is our lead disciple still isolating himself?\u201dElder Ruyan asked.Chu Kuangren had now become their last hope.\u201cYes. I\u2019ve just briefly scanned through the Daoist Palace using my spiritual thought. Kuangren is still locking himself in his room,\u201d Honourable Xuan Qi helplessly replied.Back at the gate of Black Heaven Sect, Gu Changge was still looking at the disciples in despise. As no one else dared accept his challenge, he continued, \u201cWhere\u2019s the person with the Supreme Daoist Physique? Why don\u2019t you call him out?\u201dHe paused for a moment before he continued insulting, \u201cIs he so scared that he\u2019s locking himself in his room?\u201d\u201cNonsense!\u201d\u201cHow dare you insult Elder Senior Brother like that!\u201d\u201cLet me have a go at him, I\u2019m fighting him right now!\u201dMurong Xuan ground his teeth as he prepared to fight Gu Changge. However, he was stopped by the few Daoists who were standing beside him as they tried to calm him down.\u201cDon\u2019t be impulsive, you\u2019re no match against him.\u201d\u201cEven a person like Nangong had been defeated in three moves. It\u2019s no use for you to fight him.\u201dWhen everyone was maddened by Gu Changge\u2019s remark, a ray of white light descended from above.Boom\u2026Dust particles were sent flying around the air as a shockwave spread from the center.The crowd shifted their attention to the spot and saw a silver-haired woman dressed in an elegant set of silver-white armor.\u201cLady Lan.\u201dThe Daoists were in mild shock.It was Lan Yu. She knew that Chu Kuangren would soon fight Gu Changge after he exited his room and had intended to watch the match.She did not plan to participate in the challenge.However, Lan Yu could no longer stand it when she heard Gu Changge insulting Chu Kuangren.She would turn a blind eye if Gu Changge had insulted anyone else, be it a respectable sage, but she could not allow anyone to belittle Chu Kuangren, whom she held in high regard!Hence, she had decided to make an appearance.Lan Yu appeared in shiny silver-white armor. A solemn, divine aura flowed around her, and her otherworldly beauty was both remarkable and jawdropping.Even Gu Changge\u2019s eyes lit up at the sight of her entrance.Being the Crown Prince of the Royal Azure Dynasty, Gu Changge had his fair share of interactions with beautiful ladies. Yet, none of their beauty could measure against that of the woman standing in front of him.Like a goddess, she had smooth, silky skin and an elegant, noble demeanor.It was one of the rare instances when Gu Changge felt a sense of envy.\u201cWho are you?\u201dGu Changge tried to soothe his tone as much as he could.He thought judging by his status as a Crown Prince and having recently defeated six sage orthodoxies, any woman would have been infatuated if he were to speak gently to them.Unfortunately, Lan Yu\u2019s reaction was merely one of cold indifference. One could feel a strong sense of hostility boiling beneath her blue eyes, hinting at the inevitable unleashing of her wrath.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who I am. What matters is you\u2019ve insulted my Master, and you shall pay for it,\u201d Lan Yu coldly replied.Her spiritual power began to erupt, the Daoist rhymes accompanied by a divine ray of lights started flowing within her.These Daoist Rhymes were enough to make Gu Changge slightly concerned.At the same time, he could feel a sense of rage boiling within him.A follower?How could a woman at this level be the follower of the Supreme Daoist Physique of Black Heaven Sect?What did that person do to deserve such a follower?\u201cI thought the Supreme Daoist Physique of the Black Heaven Sect would make an outstanding opponent. Who would have thought that he would end up hiding behind a woman\u2019s back?\u201cYou\u2019ll have no future following a person like this. Let me offer you a chance to follow by my side. If you agree, you\u2019ll be blessed with unprecedented privileges. I could even consider making you my Crown Princess.\u201dGu Changge stared at Lan Yu as his eyes glimmered with desire.Unfortunately, Lan Yu reacted with even greater hostility and said, \u201cYou insulted my Master, and now you let your imagination run rampant. This is unforgivable!\u201dLan Yu did not speak any further as she clenched her fists and initiated the first strike.An array of white lights, filled with divine Intent, was launched forward!The Daoist rhyme shocked everyone in the crowd.Gu Changge did not dare underestimate her. He channeled his spiritual energy and launched a counterattack as well.Both of their fist attacks clashed directly against each other as the Daoist rhymes exploded from the impact, sending an enormous shockwave into the surroundings. Yet, Lan Yu and Gu Changge did not retreat at all.Everyone was astonished.They knew just how powerful Gu Changge was when he defeated Nangong Huang in three strikes. Yet, who would have thought Lan Yu was capable enough to go head to head with him?!In the distance, Honorable Xuan Qi and a few spectators were observing the fight closely.\u201cWho\u2019s this woman?\u201d\u201cWhy does this Daoist rhyme look like the divine light that would radiate from the legendary Supreme Daoist Physique?\u201d Honorable Xuan Qi asked skeptically.As he made that remark, his companions were instantly in awe.Could it actually be a Supreme Daoist Physique?!\u201cIf that is indeed the case, it\u2019s no wonder this woman could withstand Gu Changge\u2019s attacks. However\u2026 Could it actually be?\u201dOne could hardly blame their skepticism. The Supreme Daoist Physique was considered an incredibly rare phenomenon. To have two of them exist in Black Heaven Sect was too rare of a coincidence.\u201cMaybe, maybe not. Regardless, this woman is no pushover at all. I have many questions for Chu Kuangren now,\u201d Honorable Xuan Qi said.Aside from the disciples and the elders, even Gu Changge was shocked by Lan Yu\u2019s display of ability. Throughout his journey toppling various sage orthodoxies thus far, very few could properly match against his power.What was more, she was a woman.The thought that a powerful, beautiful woman like Lan Yu would become another man\u2019s follower made Gu Changge\u2019s jealousy grow even stronger.\u201cSuch a pity that a woman like you has chosen to pledge your loyalty for a weak man who doesn\u2019t dare to even face me,\u201d Gu Changge shook his head and said.Many could sense a hint of jealousy in his tone.\u201cPfft, such a shame. The Crown Prince of the Royal Azure Dynasty would typically have no qualms getting a woman of his choice. Too bad that Lady Lan isn\u2019t someone he can simply desire and get.\u201d\u201cIndeed. Lady Lan belongs with our Elder Senior Brother. Gu Changge\u2019s appearance and facial features are such a far cry compared to our Elder Senior Brother.\u201d\u201cOur Elder Senior Brother is the best. He doesn\u2019t even have to make an appearance and Gu Changge has already lost the battle.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 24": "Chapter 24: Three Supreme Level Foundations, Gu Changge Is Intimidated\u201cYou have once again insulted my Master!\u201cYou deserve to die!\u201dLan Yu did not pick up the scent of jealousy in Gu Changge\u2019s tone. She was too preoccupied with being angry after hearing Gu Changge insult Chu Kuangren.She swiftly spread her wings out, her oppressive spiritual power reached its peak.\u201cShe\u2019s a winged human!\u201d\u201cI didn\u2019t expect that Lan Yu was part of the Winged Human Tribe.\u201d\u201cAre all the ladies in the Winged Human Tribe as beautiful as she is?\u201d\u2026Lan Yu\u2019s wing had spread out as she transitioned into her strongest battle form.She flapped her wings and took off into the sky. From above, like a superior martial art goddess, her cold gaze landed upon Gu Changge.Such a battle form had shocked everyone even further.Lan Yu activated her spiritual power, and a strong gush of Daoist rhymes came pouring out. A glow of white light manifested between her hands and transformed into an enormous battle spear.Mysterious Daoist symbols surrounded the long spear, radiating a domineering aura.It was enough to slightly intimidate Gu Changge.\u201cJudgement of Light!\u201dLan Yu let out a battle roar as she readied herself to fling the spear outwards.Suddenly, a multicolored light pillar was seen shooting straight into the sky at a distance.A wave of mysterious Daoist rhymes instantly filled the entire vicinity.This peculiar phenomenon instantly captured everyone\u2019s attention, including Lan Yu. Her face reacted in surprise as she slowly withdrew her spear.With the flap of a wing, Lan Yu immediately dashed towards the direction of the light pillar.The light pillar had come from the Towering Heaven Palace, precisely where Chu Kuangren was residing.Nothing mattered more than Chu Kuangren to Lan Yu.Nangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and the rest made haste towards the pillar as well.\u201cLet\u2019s go and see what\u2019s happening there.\u201dGu Changge was seen muttering to nobody in particular.\u2026The first group who made it to the Towering Heaven Palace were actually Honorable Xuan Qi, Elder Ruyan, and the other seniors.Staring at the light pillar, they could only look at each other in confusion.\u201cWhat is our lead disciple doing this time?\u201d\u201cI have no idea.\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi and the rest were clueless.Judging by how many surprises Chu Kuangren had been making in the past couple of days, they could barely contain their excitement.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dLan Yu and the rest had made it to the scene too.At that moment, another anomaly occurred again.The spiritual qi in the surrounding area began to flow violently as it congregated to a central point. Then, the spiritual qi began to condense and morphed into a Daoist foundation that was shaped like a pagoda. It had seven levels to it.\u201cThis is the Daoist Foundation of the Foundation Establishment Realm. Is someone establishing one?\u201dElder Ruyan asked.\u201cI don\u2019t think so. Establishing a foundation wouldn\u2019t create such a dramatic transformation in their surroundings.\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi shook his head.Then, as the ground began to shake, the Daoist Foundation Establishment began to ascend another two levels and became a Nine-Level Daoist Foundation!Enchantment symbols surrounded the Nine-Level Daoist Foundation as enigmatic Daoist rhymes filled the atmosphere.The spectators were shocked beyond words.\u201cA Nine-Level Daoist Foundation Establishment! This is also the Supreme Daoist Foundation Establishment!\u201d\u201cThe limit to such foundations is only nine levels. Very few cultivators are able to construe an entire Nine-Level Daoist Foundation Establishment throughout the entirety of Firmament Star.\u201d\u201cI understand now!\u201d Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s face lightened up. He continued, \u201cKuangren is reconstructing his entire cultivation base. He\u2019s resetting his root foundations!\u201dOnce a person reached a certain level of their cultivation base, their root foundations would usually remain fixed. To reset one\u2019s root foundation was deemed as a tremendously difficult task.Moreover, a slight mistake could be all it took to damage one\u2019s root foundations beyond recovery.\u201cOnce the root foundation is damaged, recovering it then becomes a task many times harder than resetting one\u2019s foundation base. The lead disciple is taking a huge risk here.\u201dOne of the elders said solemnly.\u201cThis is impressive!\u201d Elder Ruyan complimented.\u201cHe\u2019s indeed my disciple!\u201dHonorable Xuan Qi laughed. He then began to enchant a protective spell over Chu Kuangren, and the rest of the elders immediately followed suit.They were cautious of Gu Changge.After all, he was a foreigner who came here to provoke their sect.Gu Changge sensed the intention and snarked, \u201cI have no interest at all in attacking him while he\u2019s vulnerable. It\u2019s a pathetic move!\u201dThen, he observed the Nine-Level Daoist Foundation as he began to react in astonishment.\u201cWho would have thought the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect would be so bold. Not only has he reconstrued his entire Daoist Foundation Establishment, but he had also rebuilt it to a Nine-Level Daoist Foundation Establishment!\u201dThere was a reason why the Nine-Level Daoist Foundation was also known as the Supreme Daoist Foundation. No other Daoist Foundation Establishment was more superior to it.Any Daoist Foundation Establishment that could rival against it would at best be only a few inches taller.Even for Gu Changge, his Daoist Foundation Establishment had only reached seven levels.Even then, it was already considered impressive. The Daoist Foundation Establishment of most cultivators only had up to two levels.Before anyone could fully process the sight they were witnessing, the spiritual qi in the air once again congregated above the Towering Heaven Palace. This time, it morphed into a shiny Golden Core!Above the Golden Core were seven verses of Daoist symbols suspending itself, signifying that it was a Seven-Verse Golden Core.Then, a surge of Daoist rhymes exploded from within the Golden Core.The Seven-Verse Golden Core immediately transformed into a Nine-Verse Golden Core!The crowd gasped.\u201cA Nine-Level Daoist Foundation Establishment and a Nine Verse Golden Core! The lead disciple has reconstrued two of his root foundations in one go! My God, how did he do that?!\u201d\u201cTo reach the Nine-Verse Golden Core is harder than reaching the Nine-Level Daoist Foundation Establishment.\u201d\u201cHe had reached the supreme levels at both root foundations. Even if his cultivation level is still at One-Color Nascent Soul, his combat ability will far surpass anyone in the same realm.\u201d\u201cOur Elder Senior Brother is amazing\u2026\u201dMurong Xuan, Nangong Huang, and the other disciples immediately had even more admiration for Chu Kuangren.On the other hand, Gu Changge was obviously disturbed by the sight.\u201cI didn\u2019t foresee that he would go on and create a Nine-Verse Golden Core. I don\u2019t remember many cultivators in the entirety of Firmament Star who are capable of reaching this level.\u201d\u201cWho in the world is this person?\u201dHaving seen Lan Yu pledge her loyalty towards Chu Kuangren and witnessing him reach two Supreme Foundation Levels, Gu Changge\u2019s curiosity towards Chu Kuangren grew.Then, a silhouette emerged walking out from the light pillar.It was a tiny figure who was only slightly taller than a foot. He was wearing a white Daoist robe that was weaved out of Daoist symbols and looked like he was about eight years old.The crowd felt that his facial features were familiar.\u201cSuch energy\u2026 This is a Nascent Soul.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Elder Senior Brother\u2019s Nascent Soul!\u201d\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cNonsense. The only person meditating in the palace is our Elder Senior Brother. Who else could it belong to?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct. Besides, the kid is so charming. Upon a closer look, you can observe that his eyebrows are similar to our Elder Senior Brother\u2019s one.\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother is so handsome. I\u2019d recognized him even if he\u2019s reduced to ashes. Recognizing his Nascent Soul is a breeze.\u201d\u2026Then, the Nascent Soul began to release multiple arrays of colored lights. There were red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, black, and white colors \u2013 a total of nine colors. This time, even Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s jaw had dropped.\u201cNine\u2026 a Nine-Color Nascent Soul!\u201d\u201cBloody f*ck!\u201dAn elder could not help but let out a swear word.A Nine-Level Daoist Foundation Establishment, a Nine-Verse Golden Core, and now a Nine-Color Nascent Soul!Chu Kuangren had actually reached three Supreme Foundation Levels in one sitting!Everyone was flabbergasted.Gu Changge\u2019s face turned even more sour, even though he was equally shocked and incredulous as the rest.The higher the realm, the harder it was to reach its Supreme Foundation Level! Even the Supreme Foundation Level of the Foundation Establishment Realm was one that countless cultivators tried to achieve but failed.Yet, the Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect had managed to achieve the unachievable.In one go, he had managed to reach the Supreme Foundation Levels at the Foundation Establishment Realm, Golden Core Realm, and the Nascent Soul Realm! Chu Kuangren\u2019s foundation levels had managed to surpass that of countless cultivators in each realm, which included Gu Changge himself!At that instance, Gu Changge\u2019s felt his ambition to forge the Heart of Invincibility was being threatened.Would he be able to go head to head against a genius at such an unprecedented level?\u201cGuard your Daoist Heart closely!\u201d A frail voice began speaking into Gu Changge\u2019s ears. It was the voice of his Daoist Protector.Before even meeting Chu Kuangren, Gu Changge was already intimidated by him!Chu Kuangren would definitely be the most formidable enemy he had ever encountered!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 25": "Chapter 25: Golden Jade Daoist Body, Chu Kuangren Reappeared, Would He Accept The Challenge?Nine-Level Daoist Foundation Establishment, Nine-Verse Golden Core, Nine-Color Nascent Soul.The three Supreme Foundation Levels manifested themselves above the Towering Heaven Palace. Boundless forms of Daoist rhymes gushed out of the manifestations as spiritual qi flooded the entire atmosphere.It was as if the energies of the entire world were rejoicing around the three Supreme Foundation Levels.The common disciples, the Daoist geniuses, the elders of the Black Heaven Sect, and even the Daoist Protector of Gu Changge were all in shock.Just like that, three Supreme Foundation Levels had been reached within a brief period of time.An occurrence like that was so rare that even ancient scriptures might not have any recordings of it.Inside the palace, Lil Bing stood in awe outside Chu Kuangren\u2019s room as she saw the manifestation of the three Supreme Foundation Levels. She muttered, \u201cI guess Master has different ways of surprising people every single day.\u201dMeanwhile, Chu Kuangren was sitting in a meditation posture on his bed. Mythical Daoist rhymes surrounded him as his body has become translucent.One could see his blood, vessels, bones, and organs with their naked eyes!Within his body, large pieces of Daoist symbols moved in and out his blood vessels.The formation of three Supreme Foundation Levels had provided so much power that it reanimated his physique and replenished his spiritual power.Gradually, Chu Kuangren\u2019s body began to emit a bright golden glow.He looked like a piece of golden jade.If anyone was in there, they would have immediately recognized it to be one of the strongest physiques that existed amongst three thousand other physiques\u2026 The Golden Jade Body!Although the Golden Jade Body was still no match against the Supreme Daoist Physique, it could measure up against Nan Gonghuang\u2019s Yinyang God-eye.Any cultivator who possessed such a physique could channel even the most common techniques into pure spiritual power.Chu Kuangren had always been one who channeled many techniques. Now that he possessed the Golden Jade Body, the purity of his spiritual power would reach its maximum capacity.It was after a while that he gradually opened his eyes.The translucence of his body had steadily turned opaque and resumed to its normal form.\u201cA whole jar of Heaven Spiritual Marrow sure does wonders. It not only helped me reach the peak of three Supreme Foundation Levels, but it\u2019s also even given me the Golden Jade Body!\u201dChu Kuangren could feel a surge of reinvigorated energy boiling within him.At that time, he had leveled up to become a Nascent Soul Cultivator.Even then, he had strong feelings that he could easily defeat a Paradise Realm Cultivator.Could it be?Had he actually grown that strong?Chu Kuangren was in fact a little skeptical.\u201cShould I\u2026 Find someone to test this out?\u201d Chu Kuangren muttered.The moment he exited the room, Chu Kuangren saw Lil Bing.\u201cMaster, you\u2019re finally out.\u201dLil Bing could not contain her excitement.\u201cYes, let\u2019s go and meet everyone else,\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded and said. He could sense that there was already a large crowd amassing outside the palace.Outside the Towering Heaven Palace, the spectators still could not settle down after watching the manifestations disappear. After all, they were the manifestations of three concurrent Supreme Foundation Levels!How many in Firmament Star were capable enough to reach Supreme Foundation Levels?What more, to cultivate three Supreme Foundation Levels!The reaction Chu Kuangren created this time was no less than the surprises he brought when he created the Sage Ruler Technique.While the crowd was still processing what they witnessed, two figures emerged from the palace.It was Chu Kuangren and Lil Bing.Chu Kuangren was dressed in long, white robes. A couple of tassels were tied near his waist while his head was wearing a jade crown. It was a majestic appearance.\u201cLook! Elder Senior Brother is here!\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother is so attractive! I would die for him.\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother! Look over here!\u201d\u201cMy God, is that outer sect disciple his personal maid? How nice, I too would like to serve by Elder Senior Brother\u2019s side.\u201d\u201cWho doesn\u2019t? I\u2019d be willing to serve tea every day if it meant I could meet a legend like him daily.\u201dEveryone quickly resumed their chatter.Lil Bing felt slightly embarrassed as she had not been subjected to this much attention before. The jealous gaze cast by some of the women had not made it easier as well.On the other hand, Chu Kuangren was merely retaining his usual posture. He was completely undisturbed by the situation.Lil Bing grew even fonder of Chu Kuangren.Her Master had never freaked out in any sort of situation.In reality, although Chu Kuangren managed to maintain his calm demeanor, he was also shocked at the number of people that turned up!However, he managed to calm himself down by reminding himself that he was the Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect!\u201cCongratulations Elder Senior Brother for completing your meditation!\u201dAt that moment, Nangong Huang took a few steps forward and shouted.\u201cCongratulations, Elder Senior Brother!\u201dMurong Xuan and the rest of the Daoists congratulated him as well.The rest of the disciples read the situation and joined in as well. Indeed, why would they not?\u201cCongratulations, Elder Senior Brother for your achievement!\u201d\u201cCongratulations!\u201dThousands of disciples cheered in unison. It was so loud that their cheers resonated through the sky.Chu Kuangren could feel himself becoming deaf.He merely nodded his head and did not say much in return.Then, Lan Yu approached Chu Kuangren and stood by his side. Her initial heroic demeanor had been replaced by a gentle, feminine posture as she softly greeted her Master.This scene had shattered the heart of various male bystanders. Yet, they could not get mad as they knew that Chu Kuangren was leagues ahead of them.\u201cOnly a person like Elder Senior Brother would be a good match for Lady Lan. They both look so good together.\u201d\u201cAgreed. Every other person would have paled in comparison.\u201dThe female onlookers were staring at Lan Yu in envy too.The duo fitted so perfectly that it was as if they were built for one another. One was akin to a calm goddess whereas the other was akin to an immortal.All other matters had instantly become trivial in the presence of the duo.Lil Bing stood beside the duo and sensed that all the attention had been shifted away from her. Although she felt saddened that she was now seen as a nobody, she did not hold any grudges towards the pair at all.After all, not everyone would have the privilege to stand beside the duo.\u201cHave you fought someone?\u201dChu Kuangren had picked up a different aura from Lan Yu. It was obvious that she had just recently fought someone before, and Chu Kuangren could sense it was no ordinary person.Otherwise, Lan Yu would typically have no issue controlling the aura she emitted.\u201cThe Crown Prince of Royal Azure Dynastic had just insulted you, master, so I couldn\u2019t help but fight him myself,\u201d Lan Yu was a little uneasy. She was afraid that Chu Kuangren would be unsatisfied by her decision.\u201cAre you hurt?\u201d asked Chu Kuangren.Seeing as Chu Kuangren had not only refrained from blaming her but instead cared for her wellbeing, Lan Yu let out a sigh of relief. In fact, she was even overjoyed by his reaction. Lan Yu shook her head and said, \u201cI just used some of my spiritual power to unleash some of my techniques. That\u2019s all.\u201d\u201cOk, that\u2019s good to hear.\u201dThen, Chu Kuangren stepped forward and greeted Honorable Xuan Qi and the elders politely.Observing Chu Kuangren\u2019s pleasant manner, Honorable Xuan Qi was even more pleased. He said, \u201cKuangren, now that you\u2019ve reached the peak of the Supreme Foundation Levels, I\u2019m sure your cultivation journey would be an even more smooth-sailing one now. I\u2019m happy to extend my congratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you, Honorable Teacher.\u201dGu Changge was frowning not far away.Ever since Chu Kuangren exited his room, he had never even acknowledged his presence. This angered Gu Changge deeply. He marched forward and said, \u201cI\u2019m the Crown Prince of the Royal Azure Dynastic, and I hereby challenge you to a fight. Do you dare to accept my challenge?\u201dLike a dragon, Gu Changge let out a roar so loud it shifted the skies!The momentum within Gu Changge\u2019s body began erupting, his aggressiveness started accumulating. His Poise of Invincibility was activated, directing its energy towards Chu Kuangren!Chu Kuangren sensed his hostility. He looked at Gu Changge, and immediately enchantment symbols began to materialize amid the depth of his eyes.Remarkable Eye of Revelation.Then, a message that contained every information about Gu Changge appeared.\u201cGu Changge, Crown Prince of Royal Azure Dynasty, Half-Step Paradise Realm Cultivator. Learned the Sage Technique, True Dragon Evocation Technique. Possess the Dragon Blood Physique. Dragon blood has begun to manifest on his right hand. Possess the sacred weapon, Dragon Scale Armor, and a drop of True Dragon Blood Essence in his inventory\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 26": "Chapter 26: One Strike To Injure Gu Changge, My Own CreationA string of text flashed in front of Chu Kuangren.Every piece of information regarding Gu Changge\u2019s identity, cultivation techniques, and even hidden tricks were now known and understood by him clearly.Chu Kuangren could not help having mixed feelings about the Eye of Revelation\u2019s superiority.After all, knowing oneself and one\u2019s enemy would mean a sure path of victory, never having to face defeat.However, this Eye of Revelation was too overpowered. Without even experiencing the enemy\u2019s techniques in battle, it had already completely disclosed and analyzed them. It was truly a terrifying technique.\u201cHey, \u2018Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect\u2019, are you afraid to fight?\u201dGu Changge uttered, thinking Chu Kuangren\u2019s silence meant that he was scared to fight him.When the thought of that came to mind, the upbeat tone in his voice proved that he was delighted.Chu Kuangren, who was browsing through all the information about his opponent retracted the Remarkable Eye of Revelation technique upon hearing those words and replied, \u201cBring it on then.\u201d\u201cAlright!\u201dGu Changge murmured, with fighting intent radiating from his eyes. \u201cLet me witness how powerful this Supreme Daoist Physique of yours is!\u201dAfter speaking, he unleashed the spiritual power in him and made the first move with a punch.The spiritual power he emitted manifested in the form of a large dragon with razor-sharp claws. The terrifying power and crushing intent of innumerable Daoist rhymes completely shrouded Chu Kuangren in an instant!That was a sage technique meant for offense, the Dragon Slaughter Fist!From Chu Kuangren\u2019s memory, specialized sage techniques for attacking were rare in the Azure Dragon Domain, some sage orthodoxies did not even have one.Facing the incoming dragon, he drew out his Sacred Descendant Self Sword.With a single slash of his blade, impeccably pure spiritual power materialized as an overbearing pillar of purple light, overwhelming and tearing through the large dragon!Yet the unyielding purple light of the blade never faded, and was pushing Gu Changge back!\u201cWhat?\u201d He exclaimed with shock, and hastily let out another punch. It managed to block the light beam from the blade, but he was still being pushed back by it.The disciples of the Black Heaven Sect were astounded by the sight of this.In his previous battles, Gu Changge had never taken a step back when facing Nangong Huang or Lan Yu.Now, he was being forced back by Chu Kuangren\u2019s blade!\u201cElder Senior Brother is indeed powerful!\u201d\u201cHaha, breaking through sage techniques with a slash and pushing back Gu Changge, it seems that Elder Senior Brother truly is the real owner of the Poise of Invincibility! \u201d\u2026\u201cWhat overwhelming Sword Qi\u201d Gu Changge\u2019s expression changed slightly.\u201cI suppose that\u2019s not yet the full extent of your abilities. It\u2019s true that your Dragon Slaughter Fist technique is already a fully realized one, but is it the only sage technique you have that\u2019s fully realized?\u201d Chu Kuangren uttered.Upon hearing this, Gu Changge was a bit shocked, and involuntarily replied, \u201cHow did you know?\u201dBeing able to cultivate any sage technique to the fully-realized realm was an extremely difficult feat, even someone at the Sky-pride level would require hundreds of years to achieve this.However, because Gu Changge was constantly challenging himself with fights against every Great Daoist in the process to cultivate his Heart of Invincibility, he unexpectedly cultivated his Dragon Slaughter Fist to the fully realized realm!Besides that, he had not shown this technique in front of others, the only ones who knew about this were his bodyguards. How did Chu Kuangren know?\u201cThat\u2019s something trivial to think about, you should focus on finding a way to defeat me first. However, the chances of this happening are close to none.\u201dChu Kuangren said casually.Since his opponent came to Black Heaven Sect looking for a match, he would naturally deal with it with nothing held back as the sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother.From the experience from the recent clash they had paired with the analysis from the Eye of Revelation, Chu Kuangren\u2019s chances of losing were slim.His isolated cultivating this time around had made a ridiculous difference. Comparing how he was before with how is now, the difference was like night and day.\u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant, you think you can look down on everyone just because you possess a Supreme Daoist Physique and all these high Foundation Levels?\u201d\u201cIn that case, do you have techniques like this up your sleeve?\u201dChu Kuangren was unrelenting when he shot back in reply.Gu Changge\u2019s face was gripped with anger and he stopped talking. Spiritual power could be seen violently surrounding him. \u201cYou really want to see the Dragon Slaughter Fist? Then let me give you a taste! Now learn your place!\u201dA loud roar boomed, the spiritual power around Gu Changge reached a tipping point.A devastatingly potent wave of Daoist rhymes was released.An incomparably ferocious, large, and life-like golden dragon appeared and was swirling around his body. Dragon scales had also taken shape on the surface of his right arm, a sign that Dragon Blood energy was gathering into his arm for his ultimate move.The punch was followed by a loud crackling sound, which caused the surrounding air to boom with vibration, violently tearing through the void.The great golden dragon\u2019s roar resounded across the atmosphere! It rushed toward Chu Kuangren with destructive intent and overbearing poise!The disciples witnessing the battle from afar all felt the terrifying force emitted by the golden dragon, an expression of fear and worry surfaced on their faces.\u201cHe has such amazing power!\u201dEven one of the Daoists could not help but exclaim.However, Chu Kuangren, despite facing the attack head-on, was calm and unmoving in his gaze. At the same time, his body was releasing a menacingly powerful aura made of Daoist Rhymes.He released a slash from the blade!In that instant, the attack of pure sword intent was as if a tsunami had been unleashed upon the realm, making the area reek of murderous intent.Whatever the beam of light from the sword touched, anything in its way was torn apart in total destruction!Almost as if the blade was the only thing left in the world.That single slash stunned every living being!While at the same time, ripped through the terrifying golden dragon.\u201cNot good!\u201dAn elderly voice cried somewhere in the distance.That was followed by a white-colored wave of spiritual power that rose and landed against the sword\u2019s beam of light.\u201cHmmph.\u201d Groaned the Honorable Xuan Qi, who seemed to foresee the incoming attack. He flicked his sleeves, releasing another wave of purple-colored sword qi.The white-colored wave of power was shattered instantly!Meanwhile, the beam of light from Chu Kuangren\u2019s sword lingered and enveloped Gu Changge\u2019s body after dispersing the golden dragon. A painful cry sounded, followed by a silhouette of someone being flung out and falling onto the ground.It was Gu Changge.In the midst of all that, an elderly man in a white robe rushed to his side.At that point, Gu Changge\u2019s body had a layer of extra golden armor on, but his face was pale white and he kept spitting out blood. There was a mild trace of sword qi lingering within the blood that was spewed out.Upon seeing the golden armor, the elderly man in the white robe breathed a sigh of relief and turned towards Chu Kuangren, who was standing not far from them. The look on the man\u2019s face was a dignified one, but it was also laced with disbelief.There was no mistake in what he saw.That slash of the blade, that Daoist rhyme, was definitely a Sage Ruler Technique!There was a Sage Ruler Technique within the Black Heaven Sect!He had not heard nor known of this fact in the past.\u201cI see you managed to bring out your Dragon Scale Armor in time, \u201d Chu Kuangren snorted.That armor was a rare sacred weapon of defense, which was developed in Gu Changge\u2019s body.He summoned the armor before being struck by the sword\u2019s light beam, but it was too late. Although the armor blocked out most of the attack, some of it still managed to hit and affect him, causing a major injury.\u201cWhat a terrifying slash, this Sage Technique\u2026 No, this could even be a Sage Ruler Technique! What kind of sword technique is this!\u201d Said Gu Changge as he stared menacingly at Chu Kuangren.\u201cIt\u2019s called the Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique, made by yours truly.\u201d Retorted Chu Kuangren.Gu Changge sneered. \u201cWhat kind of joke is this, a self-developed Sage Ruler Technique? You think you\u2019re a sage ruler?\u201dThe people surrounding them had a stupefied look on their faces.Gu Changge did not believe what he said, but everyone around them knew that what Chu Kuangren said was true. That Sage Ruler Technique really was developed by him.\u201cThat\u2019s the difference right there.\u201d Nangong Huang sighed.\u201cYeah, the guy had already invented his own Sage Ruler Technique and then had personally admitted to you that he did it all on his own. Yet you choose to not just doubt him but to question him instead. You really are incomparable to him.\u201d Murong Xuan chimed on.Gu Changge took in the look that everyone gave him and started to realize something within himself. Could it possibly be that his opponent had invented a technique on his own?No, it was impossible.Even with the Supreme Daoist Physique, this Chu Kuangren was just simply a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator, how could he possibly come up with his own technique?How could a monster like him possibly exist in this world!?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 27": "Chapter 27: True Dragon Blood Essence, Just a Single SlashGu Changge calmed himself down from the shock he experienced and coldly replied Chu Kuangren, \u201cNo matter what, I\u2019m going to defeat you today!\u201dUp until that point, he was only a few steps away from completing the Heart of Invincibility. If he were to lose to Chu Kuangren now, all of his effort would be wasted!He would not allow such a thing to happen.\u201cMy crown price, this person is too strong, I\u2019m afraid\u2026\u201dThe elderly white-robed man hesitantly told him.He had not finished his sentence, but the meaning was loud and clear.Chu Kuangren possessed a Supreme Daoist Physique level and a Sage Ruler Technique, and also managed to develop the Three Great Supreme Foundation Levels to their peaks. His strength wildly exceeded that of his realm.Just a mere slash was enough to critically wound him.If that battle went on, Gu Changge would undoubtedly fall!\u201cElder Ouyang, just let the young ones deal with their matters themselves, why get yourself mixed up in this?\u201d Honorable Xuan Qi spoke in a light-hearted tone while looking at the elderly man in a white robe.The white-robed elder\u2019s name was Ouyang, and he was an offering of the Royal Azure Dynasty, and also the personal bodyguard of Gu Changge. His cultivation was at the level of the Honorable Realm.\u201cI\u2019m the protector of his royal highness, so it\u2019s only natural for me to think of his wellbeing.\u201dElder Ouyang calmly replied.\u201cBut this fight is one that\u2019s concerning the young ones, regardless whether you\u2019re a bodyguard or not. You have no right to meddle with the decisions of the Azure Dynasty\u2019s Prince.\u201dAfter speaking, the Honorable Xuan Qi turned to Gu Changge and told him, \u201cSo what will it be, your highness? Are you still going to continue the fight? If not then you might as well just surrender and give up.\u201dGu Changge glanced back at Honorable Xuan Qi, this cheap lowly master wanted to keep the Heart of Invincibility out of his reach it seemed.\u201cFight! I\u2019ll defeat him no matter what!\u201d Gu Changge boldly retorted and turned down Elder Ouyang\u2019s attempt to advise him.\u201cVery well.\u201dThere was a satisfied smile on Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s face. He then told Chu Kuangren using telepathy, \u201cKuangren, if Gu Changge\u2019s Heart of Invincibility were to be completed, it will soon become a large obstacle on your journey to be the Emperor!\u201cJudging from his wounds, it doesn\u2019t even matter if he has Saint Weapons, it\u2019ll be very easy to take him down. Make sure you go all out to truly defeat him! Break his Heart of Invincibility, and after this, he won\u2019t be a problem!\u201dChu Kuangren began to realize that when Honorable Xuan Qi initially provoked Gu Changge, he did it for him to get rid of another obstacle on his climb to Emperor Level.He gave out a subtle nod, a sign that he understood.Victory seemed to be in the palm of his hand.However, Gu Changge retorted, \u201cYou think that just because you managed to land a hard blow on me that you can take me down that easily? Then you\u2019re sorely mistaken!\u201cI\u2019m the crown prince of the Royal Azure Dynasty, I have many techniques and skills that you can\u2019t even expect, but now I\u2019ll let you truly see how formidable I am!\u201d\u201cWill you just stop it with the nonsense already, when are you going to use the True Dragon Blood Essence?\u201d Chu Kuangren impatiently uttered.The moment he heard that sentence, Gu Changge\u2019s face froze in shock and he menacingly asked, \u201cHow the hell do you know that I have the True Dragon Blood Essence?\u201dIt was a gift that was bestowed upon by his father the Emperor, and was his biggest trump card. Even his protector did not know about that item.However, Chu Kuangren completely exposed him!Back then during the previous bout, when he managed to easily counter and break through his Dragon Slaughter Fist, it gave Gu Changge a feeling that his opponent had completely seen through all his moves.That feeling was very terrifying indeed, and it sent chills down his spine.\u201cCan it be that he has the ability of deduction, or some sort of clairvoyance?\u201dThe skill of clairvoyance was an extremely rare talent. The ones who possessed this skill were able to predict future events, such as the road to Emperor\u2019s Realm opening. Such a person could be considered an extremely skilled clairvoyant.Supreme Daoist Physiques, Supreme Foundation Level, Clairvoyance\u2026How many more hidden techniques or abilities did this man still have!Gu Changge gulped, a trace of fear started to spread within him.However, he courageously held back that feeling of fear, and firmly spoke back, \u201cSo what if you have the skill of clairvoyance? I\u2019m having your head today, and your blood will be used to cultivate my Heart of Invincibility! With this, I\u2019ll be able to ascend to become the Supreme Emperor!\u201dA roar was let out, the momentum from Gu Changge\u2019s body instantly erupted!That drop of True Dragon Blood Essence could be seen burning within him. An unparalleled surge of energy burst out immediately and blood-red rays of light shone into the air. Rays upon lines of energy seemed to appear out of nowhere, and formed into the shape of a Supreme True Dragon!The True Dragon roared, its poise rumbling the heavens and earth!All the creatures throughout the land were groveling and trembling from that roar, their bodies facing and heads bowing towards the direction of the Black Dragon Sect.\u201cThis is the might of the True Dragon!\u201d\u201cIt seems there really is a drop of this True Dragon Blood Essence within Gu Changge\u2019s body. Judging from the might of that dragon\u2019s poise, this is at least a Supreme Realm True Dragon Blood Essence. D*mn it, this is going to be troublesome.\u201dThe Honorable Xuan Qi and Elder Ruyan had a grim look on their faces.They were ready to make a move to suppress Gu Change.it was crucial that Chu Kuangren, who had the Supreme Daoist Physique, did not sustain too much damage.A single roar from that dragon was enough to cause everything around it to rumble, and all living beings around that area to tremble.At that point, Gu Changge had changed. His wounded body healed in that instant and draconic scales and wrinkles delicately covered his face when paired with the Sacred Dragon Scale Armor he wore, shining in bright gold.Gu Changge gripped his fists and a terrifying surge of spiritual power erupted, which sent out violent shockwaves into the air. He comfortably closed his eyes as if he was enjoying the power that was surging through him and grinned. \u201cI feel like now, I can fight equally with a Battle Monarch!\u201dA Battle Monarch was a realm above the Paradise realm. Gu Changge as he was now could spar evenly with a Battle Monarch, that was the power of the True Dragon Blood Essence.\u201cTo be able to force me to use this move is well deserved of the Supreme Daoist Physique wielder of the Black Heaven Sect! However, the title of Emperor Realm belongs to no one but me!\u201cCome, let me bestow you a crippling defeat!\u201cBecome a stepping stone for me to attain Emperor Realm!Gu Changge looked at Chu Kuangren, whose hair was messed up due to him dodging with the attack.Following this, the spiritual power erupted from his body, and Daoist Rhymes flowed from him violently. An unusual wave of transformative power surged through, eventually taking the form of a golden dragon behind him.\u201cDragon Blood Physique Transformation!\u201cDragon Scale Armor, activate!\u201cDragon Slaughter Fist!\u201dGu Changge set aflame his True Dragon Blood Essence, triggered his Physique Transformation, activated the power of his Saint Weapon, and unleashed his Fully Realized Sage Dragon Slaughter Fist Technique towards Chu Kuangren.The terrifying momentum of the attack resonated into the void.The surging spiritual power drummed through the air frantically, spreading circles of shockwaves upon shockwaves, followed by a fiery dragon-shaped fist that came out from that attack.That single punch reverberated the space around it.The unparalleled dragon poise permeated thousands of miles, and rumbled across the rivers and mountains!The crowd was utterly captivated by that single punch, and at Chu Kuangren who was about to receive it. The Honorable Xuan Qi must have been struggling to control himself from interfering in this match.At that instant, Chu Kuangren moved.Rows upon rows of Sword Daoist Rhymes emerged out of thin air, intertwining and forming into the Sword of the Heavens. An innumerable flow of sword qi gushed out into the open in all directions. It formed into the shape of a prison, the Nine Heaven Sword Prison!Following that, Daoist Rhymes started to gather and swirl beneath the feet of Chu Kuangren. They soon combined and formed a Thirty Sixth-ranked sword qi green lotus, waves upon waves upon of Daoist Rhymes echoed in the air.It transformed into the Green lotus Sword Song.The three Great Daoist Transformations, fully activated!After this, the body of Chu Kuangren radiated with golden light and the husk of his body became as clear as crystal-like a golden jade. Just when he surpassed the threshold of his spiritual power, the Golden Jade body automatically manifested itself.\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique!\u201dChu Kuangren held the Great Sacred Descendant Self Sword, and let out a slash.The boundless offensive sword intent erupted and its menacing beam of light flowed against the Daoist Rhyme of the dragon-shaped fist. Compared to this, what had happened beforehand was child\u2019s play!With an explosion, the punch attack was completely obliterated!The sword\u2019s unyielding beam of light landed a strong blow on Gu Changge\u2019s body.The Dragon Blood Physique transformation was shattered in an instant by that sword qi!Dragon Scale Armor, the Saint Weapon, was battered so hard that it became dull and cracked!That devastating attack caused Gu Changge again to spew blood, the originally mighty Dragon Poise was beaten to pieces by that single sword attack!\u201cEven after so much nonsense, it\u2019s down to a single slash.\u201dAmidst the silence, Chu Kuangren murmured.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 28": "Chapter 28: Unconscious Crown Prince, Another Supreme Daoist PhysiqueAnywhere the sword\u2019s light beam touched, the void around it was obliterated to the point of collapsing.The mighty and majestic-looking Dragon Poise was instantly reduced to nothing!The crown prince of the Azure Dynasty, Gu Changge was again flung across with wounds wildly spurting blood from the attack he received. That was the second time he had been sent flying by Chu Kuangren.With a single slash of the blade as well!\u201cYour highness!\u201dThe expression on Elder Ouyang\u2019s face changed, and he dashed towards the crown prince.The injuries that were inflicted upon the Azure Dynasty\u2019s crown prince were more severe than before, even the Dragon Scale Armor had been cracked after blocking that attack. Menacing wisps of Sword Qi were seeping through the cracks of that armor, continuously damaging Gu Change\u2019s body.\u201cThis is just a simple friendly match, was it necessary to land such a strong blow?\u201dElder Ouyang stared at Chu Kuangren with anger.His Supreme Poise darted towards Chu Kuangren with menace!However, with the Sword of the Heavens in his hands, the Green Lotus Sword Qi at his feet, the Nine Heaven Sword Prison surrounding his body, Chu Kuangren was unmoving as he faced Elder Ouyang\u2019s questioning.\u201cIt was just one slash!\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s reasoning was obvious.He only let out a single slash.One could only blame Gu Changge\u2019s weakness for not being able to block that single sword slash.\u201cYou\u2026\u201dElder Ouyang was so gripped with rage that he was stumped at finding words to refute.Was his Highness that weak?If that were the case, then he would not have been able to consecutively defeat the Six Great Sage Orthodoxies. On the contrary, he was strong, as there were not many among his peers that could match his strength.Then why was he defeated so badly?It was because Chu Kuangren was that strong!Supreme Daoist Physiques, Golden Jade Body, Sale Ruler Techniques, Sacred Weapons\u2026 having any of these were enough to strike fear in the hearts of anyone.However, all of these abilities and techniques were possessed by a single person.How terrible could this get?The more elder Ouyang thought about it, the more concerned he got. Glaring at Chu Kuangren\u2019s grim-looking eyes, swirls of Ouyang\u2019s Poise dashed towards him and his three great Daoist Physique transformations, yet he barely moved an inch!He took the full blow of the Supreme Poise with those three great Daoist Physiques!Just when Elder Ouyang was about to increase the power of his Supreme Poise to further gauge Chu Kuangren\u2019s limit, an equally terrifying force suddenly erupted from somewhere else.It was from the Honorable Xuan Qi, glaring menacingly at him and said, \u201cAre you looking for death, Elder Ouyang?\u201dPurple swirls of Sword Qi surrounded Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s body.Every swirl contained enough power to tear mountains and rivers apart.The Honorable Teacher\u2019s Supreme Poise instantly sealed the area around them.Elder Ouyang trembled. There was no question that he was in the Honorable Realm as well, yet was far weaker compared to the Honorable Xuan Qi, who was in charge of a whole orthodoxy. If his opponent wished, he could take him out in a single attack!\u201cI apologize for acting out as such.\u201dElder Ouyang took a deep breath and retracted his momentum.He had no choice but to heed and respect others when he was in their domain!\u201cHmmph.\u201d Honorable Xuan Qi acknowledged his apology.Elder Ouyang looked towards Gu Changge, the Royal Azure\u2019s crown prince, who was now laying on the ground in such disgrace, murmuring at Chu Kuangren, \u201cImpossible, this is impossible\u2026\u201dThis obviously meant that the Heart of Invincibility was completely broken!These events might even lead to an unstable Daoist\u2019s core within Gu Changge, which could develop into a Heart Demon!This Heart Demon would, undoubtedly, be Chu Kuangren!In other words, Gu Changge might develop psychological trauma from that defeat.\u201cThis is the so-called Heart of Invincibility? It can\u2019t be, it\u2019s too fragile and weak. I guess the wielder\u2019s mental strength is just not good enough.\u201d Chu Kuangren shook his head while looking over at Gu Changge.The onlooking disciples in the crowd could not hold back their grin upon witnessing the Crown Prince\u2019s defeat.\u201cElder senior brother\u2026 Really wasn\u2019t afraid!\u201d\u201cYeah, I thought the Elder Senior Brother was putting on a tough act as well. I never expected that he actually hadn\u2019t taken Gu Changge seriously at all.\u201d\u201cGu Changge really wasn\u2019t intimidating then, and it was also just a matter of a single slash as well. Haha, that\u2019s awesome!\u201d\u201cWith Elder Senior Brother around, every sky-pride in the world would be humbled by disgrace!\u201dThe chattering started to build up, and every word entered Gu Changge\u2019s ears.The more he heard the more enraged he got, but after seeing Chu Kuangren he felt a sense of inferiority grow within him. The two feelings clashed and gathered in his chest, like a mountain that weighed upon him, crushing him underneath and leaving him gasping for air.Eventually, Gu Changge his injuries overwhelmed him and blood spewed from his mouth. His vision darkened and his head lowered into a tilt, fully blacking out.\u201cDid he become unconscious already?\u201d Chu Kuangren blinked as he could not believe his eyes, and realizing that Gu Changge\u2019s mental strength really was quite weak.Passing out due to words alone, unbelievable.Elder Ouyang was shocked and quickly grabbed hold of the crown prince in his arms, constantly transferring spiritual power into his body to reduce the impact from the opponent\u2019s damage.Soon after, his figure turned into a stream of light and dashed outwards the mountain exit.\u201cNot even a single word huh, how rude of them.\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s lips curled.He calmingly retracted the physique transformations. The boundless Sword Daoist Rhymes dispersed into the air, and in its place came the misty Banished Immortal Aura.The disciples stared at Chu Kuangren attentively, their hearts beating like crazy. Countless gazes of admiration were laid upon him.Noticing all eyes on him, Chu Kuangren gently smiled, maintaining the friendly, humble, and polite demeanor of an Elder Senior Brother.That smile he let out captivated the souls of many.\u201cMy god, Elder Senior Brother\u2019s smile is just too perfect.\u201d\u201cThat smile is illegal, I\u2019m dying over here.\u201d\u201cMeeting you in this life, if you won\u2019t propose to me, then I won\u2019t be married to anyone. \u201d\u2026Chu Kuangren came to the Honorable Xuan Qi and a few others and said, \u201cYour disciple has carried out the given task, Gu Changge has been defeated.\u201d\u201cVery well, very well, good\u2026\u201d Praised the Honorable Teacher who was impressed and satisfied as he looked upon Chu Kuangren.\u201cAfter this battle, your name shall be well known among the Azure Dragon Domain, but that also means you have picked up a grudge against the Royal Crown Prince as well.\u201d Elder Ruyan told him.Chu Kuangren laughed confidently. \u201cUndoubtedly so, if I can already defeat him the first time, then I can also do it the second and third. He will never be able to beat me.\u201d\u201cHahaha, well said, my disciple!\u201d Said the Honorable Xuan Qi. \u201cThat\u2019s the spirit that cultivators should possess! He\u2019s just a simple Azure Prince, nothing much you should be worried about.\u201cAs long as that bunch of old farts doesn\u2019t interfere, matters concerning you young ones should be settled within yourselves.\u201cIf they were to try anything funny, then they shall find out that my Black Heaven sect will not be easily harassed or bullied.\u201dAfter saying those words, a cold gaze filled Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s eyes, everyone in the crowd could feel a slight chill in the air, a drop in temperature.However it was just in a short instant, and everyone knew that it would be unwise for the Royal Azure Dynasty to cause troubles for Chu Kuangren. Otherwise, they would realize that the rage of an Honorable Supreme One was not one that could be easily trifled with.\u201cOh yes, Kuangren, I want to ask you about something.\u201dThe Honorable Xuan Qi shifted his gaze towards Lan Yu, who was standing nearby. \u201cIs this lady here your follower?\u201d\u201cYes, master.\u201d\u201cThis lady doesn\u2019t seem to be qualified from the looks of it, what\u2019s her origin?\u201d\u201cLan Yu possesses the Holy Radiant Physique!\u201dChu Kuangren was straightforward with his reply.Upon hearing this, everyone in the crowd gasped, some looking at Lan Yu in disbelief.Another Supreme Daoist Physique!Not only that, but she was also Chu Kuangren\u2019s follower as well!Thinking of that, the crowd started to admire Chu Kuangren more. For a Supreme Daoist Physique wielder to be his personal follower, how many people had such a privilege?However, Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s expression was an imposing one. The sudden appearance of another Supreme Daoist Physique, could there be a hidden sign or trick within all of this?\u201cPlease rest assured Honorable Teacher, Lan Yu here is definitely reliable.\u201dChu Kuangren said.The Honorable Xuan Qi pondered a while and soon nodded. \u201cAlright, just make sure to keep yourself in check.\u201dIf someone really were planning something in the shadows, sending another Supreme Daoist Physique wielder here as another pawn in the game would be going overboard.Besides, Lan Yu was a member of the Winger Human tribe, and they definitely did not have anyone that possessed a Supreme Daoist Physique there. Where would they be willing to send someone so valuable?\u201cIt seems to be due to Kuangren\u2019s own fate.\u201dThe Honorable Xuan Qi no longer thought about it soon after.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 29": "Chapter 29: Let Them Bloom and Sprout, For I Alone Shall Stand OutAfter Gu Changge\u2019s defeat, Chu Kuangren suddenly requested permission from Honorable Xuan Qi to venture out of the sect for his training. After all, in such a great environment with flowing rivers and gigantic mountains, it would be a waste if he were to stay within the Black Heaven sect all the time, that would be boring indeed.Besides that, he was also cultivating his Nascent Soul level abilities to add a few tricks up his sleeve. As he was now able to protect himself, it was time he went out for an adventure.\u201cA flower kept within the warmth of a greenhouse will never stand to bear the harshness of the storms outside. Kuangren, it\u2019s not that I forbid you to train yourself outside, but I\u2019ll need you to wait another two days within the Black Heaven sect, as I\u2019ll assign you a personal bodyguard.\u201d The Honorable Xuan Qi said.For a Sky-Pride of an orthodoxy setting out on a journey, a personal protector will usually be assigned to them to ensure their safety.Especially so for a Sky-Pride like Chu Kuangren, further consideration had to be taken.\u201cAlright.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded slightly.Even he was curious as to who would be assigned to him as a bodyguard.\u2026Black Heaven Sect, behind the Mountain.A few thatched houses laid within the lush green bamboo forest.Not many, even within Black Heaven Sect, knew of these houses, yet within them lay the strongest foundation and the backbone of the whole Sect!Something creaked.One of the doors of the thatched houses opened.Out came an elderly man in a white robe.\u201cSeventh Forefather, are you sure about doing this?\u201dAn elderly voice can be heard from one of the other thatched houses.The white-robed elder gently smiled. \u201cAt this age, I\u2019m like a candle in the wind, and my days are numbered, so I\u2019m going on a trip to the Earthly realm while I still have some use left.\u201d\u201cIf you were to stay back and recuperate, you\u2019ll live for another few hundred years at least. Yet if you are in the Earthly realm, you might meet a strong foe and exhaust your spiritual power. If that happens I fear you might not last even the next few years.\u201d The voice in the thatched house warned.\u201cYes, I\u2019m well aware of that. But the young one\u2019s disciple truly is a remarkable one. I wish to protect him by walking in the Earthly realm once more.\u201dThe Seventh Forefather replied with a smile.A silence fell on the other thatched houses.After a while, a voice came from one of the houses, \u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then so be it. Go then, and complete your final journey.\u201d\u201cThank you, Second Forefather for granting this request.\u201dThe Seventh Forefather gently cupped the palm of his hands, turned around, and proceeded to walk towards the exit of the bamboo forest.A gentle breeze blew, and bamboo leaves whistled. On that day, a Supreme elder re-entered the Earthly Realm for the sake of his future disciple.\u2026Black Heaven Sect, at the Mountain Gate.A crowd of disciples had gathered there, they were looking at the figure at the gate who was wearing a white robe with a look of reluctance.The figure was Elder Senior Brother Chu Kuangren.Today was the day he finally set out to undergo more training.\u201cOh dear, Elder Senior Brother is about to leave. I\u2019m going to miss him so much!\u201d\u201cWho wouldn\u2019t, the moment I think of not being able to see Elder Senior Brother for a long time, I\u2019ve completely lost the motivation to continue my cultivation.\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother, take care!\u201d\u201cThe mountain path is filled with harsh perils, do be careful Elder Senior Brother.\u201d\u2026\u201cMy lord, please take extra care of yourself out there. Make sure to not starve yourself and stay away from the cold.\u201d Said Lil Bing to her master, tears flowing down her eyes.Chu Kuangren patted her head, and with a gentle smile said, \u201cTake good care of the Towering Heaven Palace for me will you? Also, remember to stay on track with your cultivation Lil Bing, I shall return soon.\u201d\u201cYes, I will do my best.\u201dLil Bing nodded confidently.If her master had been working so hard, it was all the more reason for her to not slack off.Chu Kuangren turned towards the Honorable Xuan Qi.Honorable Xuan Qi felt a sense of sadness and reluctance, but even he knew that eventually the younglings would have to leave their nests, and learn to fly and live on their own.\u201cKuangren, the outside is different from our Black Heaven Sect. Although your talents are peerless, you\u2019ll need to beware of the sinister hearts of men and be cautious at all times.\u201cThink twice before you act.\u201d The Honorable Xuan Qi reminded.\u201cRest assured Honorable Teacher, I understand.\u201dChu Kuangren gently nodded.\u201cKuangren, the situation in the world now is in quite some chaos, which has revealed the true nature of conflict and war. There now exists various Orthodoxies and even more kinds of Sky-Prides everywhere, popping out like mushrooms after a rain. When you\u2019re out there, make sure to always stay vigilant.\u201d\u201cAlthough safety is your main priority, take care not to weaken the image of our Black Heaven Sect. Do remember, you are the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect. The Black Heaven Sect will forever have your back.\u201d Said Elder Ruyan in a heavy reminding tone.Chu Kuangren listened attentively, nodded, and laughed confidently. \u201cDon\u2019t worry Elder, before I descend, those mushrooms can pop up wherever they want, be it flowers or weeds or even trees like the wonders of nature. But once I see them, I will dominate and defeat them all, and be the only flower left standing!\u201dUpon hearing this, the Honorable Xuan Qi and the other elders were slightly taken aback and fell into bouts of laughter, looking at Chu Kuangren admirably.The crowds of disciples were also inspired by his words, some were even swept away like a maiden while everyone cheered him on.\u201cWell said Elder Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cWe should not hold Elder Senior Brother back, his journey today outwards is to seek glory for our Black Heaven Sect, to let the whole world know about us!\u201dAll the disciples looked at Chu Kuangren with even more delight and appreciation.Chu Kuangren himself cupped his hands towards the crowd, saluted, turned his back, and left. Lan Yu followed behind right after, walking down the mountain.The two Supreme Daoist Physique wielders had officially gone out into the world.\u2026It had been three days since Chu Kuangren defeated Gu Changge.However, before Chu Kuangren descended into the world, word of him had already spread far and wide. After all, being able to defeat the Azure Dynasty\u2019s crown prince was not a small feat anyone could accomplish.Not to mention he wielded a Supreme Daoist Physique.For some time, every region within the Azure Dragon domain was shaken by the news.\u201cGu Changge lost!\u201d\u201cGu Changge was finally defeated, he lost to the newcomer of the Black Heaven Sect Chu Kuangren. And he suffered a crushing defeat as well, being taken down by only a single slash of the sword!\u201d\u201cWhat? This Chu Kuangren guy is that strong?\u201d\u201cWhen did such a Supreme Sky-pride exist within the Black Heaven Sect?\u201d\u201cGu Changge\u2019s strength defeated the Six Great Sage Orthodoxies, and he even had the Poise of Invincibility before heading to the Black Heaven Sect. How could Chu Kuangren defeat him in a single slash? If this is true, then this Chu Kuangren can really declare himself a Young Emperor then!\u201d\u201cGo investigate! Find out everything about this Chu Kuangren\u2019s origins!\u201d\u201cGu Changge, the high and mighty one who defeated the Six Great Sage Orthodoxies. Despite how amazing that is, he was still defeated in the end by someone else. Now that I think of it his Heart of Invincibility must be destroyed then, another obstacle gone on the Road to Emperor\u2019s Realm.\u201dWord of Gu Changge\u2019s defeat spread throughout all four corners of Firmament Star.There were also people who had been digging up Information about Chu Kuangren.About that, his Supreme Daoist Physique, three Great Supreme Foundation Levels, self-created Sage Ruler technique stood out among his other characteristics. Those very facts paralyzed the many cultivators from various orthodoxies with fear.\u201cMy god, is this guy a monster?\u201d\u201cHow could this be? Are the facts exaggerated?\u201d\u201cSheesh, these are only rumors. I don\u2019t believe there exists a beast like him in the world. These facts must be made up.\u201d\u201cSuch heavenly form, that guy is at the level of a Young Emperor!\u201dThere were those that believed, and there were those that doubted.Nevertheless, Chu Kuangren had become a hot topic among every great Orthodoxy. They were even people who rated him at the Young Emperor level!What did that mean?Well, Young Emperor was one who was destined to reach the Emperor level!Among the nicknames that Supreme Sky-prides possess, the moniker of the Young Emperor only deserves to be given to the star that shined the brightest in the entirety of Firmament Star.Even Gu Changge did not possess the aptitude to receive this epithet.Though, Chu Kuangren\u2019s fame would be fleeting as his victories were too little to make a good comparison. The nickname of Young Emperor was only thrown around without much weight and was gone not a while after.Following this, the narrative of Chu Kuangren began to branch out.Chu Kuangren had descended into the world! Not only that, he even issued a challenge to every Sky-pride in the world, seeking to reach the peak of dominance across the land!As soon as the news came out, it shook the world.Every great Orthodoxy and their numerous Sky-prides had an even more intense reaction. Most of them were angered by that very statement and sought to battle him. There were also those that sneered at Chu Kuangren, mocking the guy for overestimating himself.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30: Let Loose the Great Sky-prides, to Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s Treasure Site\u201cHaha, let them bloom and sprout, for I alone shall stand out!\u201d\u201cSplendid, Chu Kuangren! Remarkable indeed! I\u2019ll see whether your strength can keep up with this madness for long!\u201dLaughed a purple-robed, stone-faced young man within the Sage Orthodox in Zhiyang Valley, while gazing at the rising sun.\u2026Within another Sage Orthodoxy, the White Lotus School, a beautiful lady with bells around her ankles was sitting by the pond. Her jade white feet were kicking up waves as they swayed lightly.\u201cBloom and sprout, for I alone shall stand out?\u201d\u201cIs the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven sect that formidable, or is he simply just good with words? Describing everything and everyone under the sky, like plants in a garden, is he really that skilled, or is he another over-ambitious kind that\u2019ll end up dead right after?\u201d\u201cThe guy better be not another Gu Changge.\u201d\u2026The Daoists of the Great Sage Orthodoxies were agitated.Some even reacted negatively upon hearing the news.\u201cI\u2019m Yuanhong from the Dharma Sect.\u201cSince the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother proclaimed that he will stand the tallest among us at the top, then I guess it\u2019s inevitable that we battle and challenge each other should our paths cross in the future.\u201dSuch was the reply of Yuanhong of the Dharma sect.That response was already considered meek and tolerating.Compared to this, the response of another Sage Orthodoxy, the Five Ways Sect was way worse. Word spread that upon hearing the news, Daoist Fangtian of the Five Ways Sect shattered a coral tree on the spot.\u201cA guy who\u2019s been hiding for more than ten years within his sect, who\u2019s only a greenhorn fledgling dares speak out like this? Ridiculous!\u201cI pray that you shall never come across or stand in my way, for I\u2019ll show you the might of the Five Way\u2019s Sect! I\u2019ll make you eat those arrogant words myself!\u201dBesides the Five Way\u2019s Sect and Dharma Sect, even a few of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s princes and princesses began to voice out.\u201cHow dare you, Chu Kuangren, you not only injured our elder brother but now you would dare to challenge the whole world? Alright then, I\u2019ll fulfill your wish!\u201dThe Royal Azure\u2019s Third Crown Prince spoke.\u201cChu Kuangren, I shall never forget your act of hurting my elder brother. If you meet me in the future, don\u2019t blame me for ruthlessly returning the favor!\u201dFollowing this, Princess Lingleng the eldest Royal Azure Princess uttered.\u2026\u201cHow bold of you Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cThe rumors are true, he\u2019s declaring a challenge to the whole world upon descending. That guy\u2019s crazy enough alright, hope he can live for at least a few days after this.\u201d\u201cThe tree that outgrows its forest will always be broken down by the wind.\u201d\u201cRevealing the edge of a blade so early will only lead to setbacks soon after. The guy thinks he\u2019s invincible after defeating Gu Changge, what a joke.\u201d\u201cThat guy is only another Gu Changge obviously.\u201dFor some time, Chu Kuangren has become a target of scrutiny for all the Sky-prides around the world. It did not matter whether the critics themselves were powerful, everyone had something to say about him, as if they themselves could look mightier doing that.\u2026During that time, the man of the hour, Chu Kuangren, alongside Lan Yu, were just leaving the Black Heaven Sect. They were heading south.He seemed to have a clear goal in his mind.\u201cMaster, where are we going now?\u201dLan Yu was curious and asked.\u201cOn a treasure hunt of course.\u201dChu Kuangren gently smiled while waving the piece of drawing in his hand.Back then during the 10 Consecutive Lucky Draws, Chu Kuangren rolled a Starlight Grade treasure map. He decided to venture out in training to find said treasure.Coincidently, it was hidden within the Azure Dragon domain.\u201cAccording to the map here, the treasure we\u2019re seeking is buried somewhere within the mountains nearby the White Cloud City of the Azure Dragon domain.\u201d Murmured Chu Kuangren.Besides the treasure, he was curious about something else, which was the lord of White Cloud City.Legend had it that Ye Wuhen of the White Cloud City was a top-notch Honorable class swordsman. Alongside Kuangren\u2019s own Honorable Teacher, they were the two pinnacles of Sword Dao within the Azure Dragon Domain and were most notably known as the Azure Dragon\u2019s Dual Blades.He knew that Honorable Xuan Qi was an Honorable Supreme. Although he had never seen his teacher in action, using the Remarkable Eye of Revelation allowed Chu Kuangren to acquire some information about him. That man\u2019s combat strength was worlds beyond that of the other Honorables.Since Ye Wuhen was as famous as his teacher, it meant that he was also in a class of his own as well.Perhaps they ought to pay him a visit while heading to White Cloud City.Two days later.Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu arrived at the area that was marked on the map, but what laid before him was a desolate piece of mountainous land.There was not even a blade of grass there, not to mention any treasure.\u201cMaster, could we possibly be in the wrong place?\u201d\u201cNope, it\u2019s definitely here.\u201d Chu Kuangren confidently smiled and said, \u201cIt\u2019s written here on the map that there\u2019s a seal that was cast upon the lands here. The treasure we\u2019re seeking is hidden within the void. To make it reveal its form, we must hit it with a strong wave of Earth Qi.\u201d\u201cA wave of Earth Qi?\u201d\u201cCorrect.\u201dChu Kuangren grinned, and right after he faced the void and let out a slight huff. His Nascent Soul cultivation base emerged and began gathering Earth Qi from the surrounding area.That was the Sage Ruler Technique, the Human Mountain Stamp!Chu Kuangren held the Stamp with his arms as its mysterious Daoist Rhymes spiraled and flowed. The mountains and rivers around them rumbled, and the gathered Earth Qi transformed into a giant majestic mountain.The majestic mountain clashed with the void as if ramming into a piece of an invisible wall. A loud impact was heard and tremendous amounts of Earth Qi swirled violently everywhere, clashing whatever it hit.A shining burst of light suddenly rose into the sky!Following that, a giant pair of golden gates appeared from within the void. Carvings of mountain ravines, strange beasts, and celestial bodies could be seen on the gate.Above the gates, a set of words made from mysterious Daoist Rhymes could be seen levitating and moving in a trance, and what was written was\u2026 Yuan Ling!Even from far away, the tremor could be felt by some experienced Daoists.\u201cWhat\u2019s that? A large gate?\u201d\u201cSuch powerful waves of energy, such dense Daoist Rhymes. Is it possible that some treasure has appeared? Let\u2019s go and find out, hurry!\u201d\u201cWhat a great opportunity! It shall be mine!\u201d\u201cYuan Ling\u2026 My god, could it be from the one that\u2019s from twenty thousand years ago? The one whose name is known to all in the world, the strongest Sage in history, Honorable Yuan Ling!\u201d\u201cHonorable Yuan Ling met his fall twenty thousand years ago trying to ascend to the Sage Manifestation Realm. Word has it that before he died, he had the collection of treasures that he gathered throughout his life hidden somewhere. Could this be that this is the location of Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s buried treasure?\u201d\u201cRumor has it that the Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate is one of Honorable Yuan Ling treasures! If one manages to find it \u2026 They\u2019ll be able to become a sage! Let\u2019s go, hurry! \u201dIn an instant, countless experienced Daoists noticed that strange occurrence.Unsurprisingly, it had sent many people into a craze!The treasures of an Honorable Supreme was enough to startle them, causing countless Daoist cultivators to head over to that location in droves. Not to mention the Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate among the treasures!After all, there were only a few sages on the surface of the Firmament Star.This was insanity.Everyone was hurrying towards the location of the large golden gate, a maddening sight.Chu Kuangren witnessed the sight before him and was bewildered.G*d d*mn it!He only wished to go on a treasure hunt properly, then leaving after grabbing the riches within. However, now that he created such a ruckus and attracted such a large crowd towards him, how was he going to secretly get rich?The Seventh Forefather who was protecting him in secret was so shocked that he almost bit off his tongue.The few days before when he kept seeing Chu Kuangren blindly wandering about with the treasure map, he did not care much about it.It was a treasure map after all, and there were many riddles of similar type. Some weird experienced Daoist would always like to leave riddles for someone to solve, and he has had his fair share of that during his youth.However, who would have thought that it would be Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasure map!The Seventh Forefather was dumbfounded.Having heard that after entering the Black Heaven Sect, not for long, Chu Kuangren had repeatedly caused trouble everywhere. Who would have figured that this guy would cause such a ruckus not even a few days after venturing out for training?The hidden treasure of Honorable Yuan Ling, that must have attracted many experienced Daoists!\u201cMaybe I should stay back in retirement at the mountain after all.\u201d The Seventh Forefather forced a smile helplessly.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31: Yuan Ling\u2019s Small World Treasury, Primordial Purple HazeThe whereabouts of Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s buried treasure were exposed.Vast amounts of Daoist Rhymes gushed forth from within, beaming as a golden light that shone up into the sky. It attracted the attention of countless experienced Daoists, especially the ones in White Cloud City nearby.Numerous streams of light reflected on their swords which flickered as they approached.Among them, the one which shone the fastest was a white-colored sword light. Everyone was mesmerized at the sight of it, and could not help but feel amazed.\u201cIt\u2019s the eldest son of the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman! Even he has set out as well.\u201d\u201cIt appears that the contents of Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasury are very attractive indeed.\u201d\u2026In front of Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasury.Staring at the pair of great golden gates before him that stood out in the open conspicuously, Chu Kuangren shook his head in frustration.\u201cG*d d*mn it.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dChu Kuangren dragged Lan Yu and dashed through the pair of great golden gates without hesitation.Upon entering the great gates, Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu\u2019s were met instantly by a bright light, and after that, they found themselves suddenly in a dense forest.\u201cThis is a small artificial world.\u201dChu Kuangren said in surprise. According to legend, there existed great cultivators that were so skilled in spatial energy, that they were able to create mini artificial worlds like this. A magnificent feat indeed.Obviously, Honorable Yuan Ling was one of those great ones.Madman Chu leaped and rose through the air. Standing at the height of a hundred meters, he surveyed the surrounding area and noticed it was all covered with vast forests and towering mountains.Not only that, but he also realized that a few restrictions were in place in the air, as he could only fly up to at most a hundred meters. Any higher than that, he\u2019d be blocked by a barrier.Landing back on the ground, Chu Kuangren took out the treasure map and found out that the marked routes on it had changed.\u201cI see, so it has become a completely new map now, how thoughtful.\u201d Uttered Chu Kuangren as he and Lan Yu both headed towards the direction marked on the map.Soon after they left, a small group of people had also entered this small artificial world. Within an instant, countless Daoist Spiritual Thoughts flowed in all directions simultaneously.\u201cWhere\u2019s the treasure?\u201d\u201cNot good, there\u2019s a restriction set up within this space. My Spiritual Thoughts are limited to only three feet, it\u2019s useless beyond that.\u201d\u201cUse your eyes then, we must find the treasure irregardless.\u201dThe small crowd each split as they headed in different directions.However, not long after, they started to encounter various challenges in their path.Some encountered terrifyingly monstrous beasts, some triggered a mechanism which released countless waves of Sword Qi that slashed them to death, some ended up entangled in an unknown location\u2026Despite this, at that time Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu were walking peacefully along a small path, enjoying the scent of flowers and chirping birds as they continued with leisure.Chu Kuangren held the treasure map and said, \u201cTsk tsk, within this mini artificial world there\u2019s a lot of horrifying monsters, hidden mechanisms, and restrictions that are set up. If we didn\u2019t have a guide to finding the correct path, finding the treasure is going to be as difficult as flying into the gates of heaven!\u201dHe could almost imagine what the other Daoists that entered the artificial world were facing, how devastated, bruised, and battered they would be from all the difficulties they were in now.Approximately half an hour later, Chu Kuangren arrived at a palace.Hidden within the mountain depths, this magnificent palace overflowed with Daoist Rhymes. There were also runes engraved on the surrounding pillars in the palace.\u201cThere it is.\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s eyes lit up.The two of them entered the palace, and before their eyes laid a large number of treasures everywhere, glittering and shimmering with light. Among the treasures were soul stones, spiritual marrows, medicinal pills, weapons \u2026There were even a few supreme weapons and saint weapons within the hordes of treasure.Piles and piles of treasure existed within the palace, and in a corner, there was a pool filled with a golden liquid. It was Earth Spiritual Marrow!Although it was less powerful than the Heaven Spiritual Marrow, a whole pool of Earth Spiritual Marrow was also highly valuable. Any of the Supremes that knew about this would definitely be very envious.A wooden box could be seen at the center of the palace hall, with intricate carvings of dragons and phoenixes on its side. There seemed to be a wisp of Daoist Rhymes flowing from the box.\u201cSo many treasures\u2026\u201d Said Lan Yu, who could not help but be amazed by it.The Seventh Forefather, who was hiding in the shadows, also could not help but felt a wave of feelings overcoming his Daoist heart. \u201cNo doubt that these treasures are worthy of the Honorable Yuan Ling, the one who\u2019s known as the undefeated Sage twenty thousand years ago. Such a collection is indeed amazing.\u201d\u201cCould it be that getting the treasure is this easy?\u201cThe treasury of the great Honorable Xuan Qi seems to not have any traps or restrictions, it\u2019s almost unbelievable that he made it in so easily?\u201cIt must be that, or this guy\u2019s map really showed him the correct path. If that\u2019s the case, then he\u2019s a real fortunate son.\u201dTo gain access to Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasure trove a few days after departing from the sect, even the Seventh Forefather could not help but marvel at that level of luck this fellow had.\u201cThis scepter, it is emitting such strong light Qi.\u201d Lan Yu was suddenly attracted by that scepter and reached out wanting to touch it.However, she was stopped by Chu Kuangren. \u201cWait.\u201d\u201cMaster?\u201d Lan Yu was puzzled.\u201cBe careful of booby traps.\u201dChu Kuangren sternly advised. He had come upon many scenes like these in movies, where the adventurers reached out and touched a particular piece of treasure, triggering a trap in the process, which either led to his friends or all of them being killed instead.\u201cLooks like TV references don\u2019t exist\u2026\u201d Chu Kuangren realized he said something that Lan Yu could not understand and began investigating the area around them.His Spiritual Thoughts spiraled and swept through the whole palace hall and he observed every single item in detail without ever laying a finger on them.The Seventh Forefather could not help but grin in the shadows, this guy was actually quite cautious.Just when he was thinking of that, he suddenly noticed something and his gaze shifted slightly.\u201cSure enough, there\u2019s something strange here.\u201dChu Kuangren had found out about something.From his investigation, most of the treasures within the hall are covered with a thin layer of dust.This layer of dust was so thin it was almost hard to make out by the untrained eye and was only discovered after Chu Kuangren swept through the area a few times with his Spiritual Thoughts.\u201cThen again, what is this actually?\u201dChu Kuangren was contemplating whether he should take the risk since he had the Immortal Body.\u201cThat\u2019s the Threefold Dark Ruler Obliterating Dust.\u201dChu Kuangren was alerted to his presence. He knew that it was the bodyguard that the Black Heaven Sect had appointed to him, it was just that the bodyguard had not revealed himself before then.\u201cThe Threefold Dark Ruler Obliterating Dust, I\u2019ve only come upon this in the scriptures. Legend has it that this item is filled with great malice and darkness, although it might appear to be like dust, its power is not to be messed around with.\u201cEven if a Battle Monarch touched it, it would instantly corrode them into a bloody puddle! Even the Honorables will need to think twice before touching it.\u201dThe Seventh Forefather explained.After hearing that, Lan Yu\u2019s expression changed slightly and she decided to take a few steps back, glaring at the treasure as if it was a horrifying beast.\u201cThis Honorable Yuan Ling is quite cunning indeed.\u201d Chu Kuangren laughed.After that, he asked the Seventh Forefather how to disable it.\u201cThat\u2019s simple.\u201dA slight breeze appeared in the hall the instant he finished speaking. The breeze blew and gathered all the specks of dust into a clump the size of an egg.\u201cThis is a very powerful item, if it\u2019s used properly, it can play a big role in helping you.\u201d The Seventh Forefather uttered.Chu Kuangren took out a flask and filled it with the Dust.That item was only effective against living beings and would not be of any use when dealing with lifeless items. If it had been, the palace would have been corroded into nothingness long before.\u201cYour sense of cautiousness is not bad, kid, even I almost overlooked that Threefold Dark Ruler Obliterating Dust. Being able to notice that is impressive.\u201dThe Seventh Forefather praised.\u201cWhen one\u2019s away from home, it\u2019s always safety first. \u201d Chu Kuangren grinned.Following that, he started to gather every treasure in the palace hall and kept them in the Yin and Yang Ring. As for the wooden box, he then went and opened it to take a look.Inside the box was a type of purple gas!That purple gas was overflowing with a horrifying Daoist Rhyme. However, upon opening the wooden box, bursts upon bursts of mysterious Daoist Rhymes swirled up around in the void, seemingly like a Sage speaking. A strange fragrance permeated through the air.\u201cThis \u2026 is the Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate, the Primordial Purple Haze!\u201dThat time, the Seventh Forefather could not help but exclaim.Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes also lit up on the sight of it.The Primordial Purple Haze, he had heard of this item before. Its renown was well known by everyone, a type of Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate, a priceless treasure!Putting it simply, once an Honorable possessed the Primordial Purple Haze, he could possibly ascend to become a Sage within only a few hundred years!However, there was a side effect to using the Primordial Purple Haze to ascend and be a Sage. The user would be the weakest among all the Sages, and it would be very hard to achieve any further progress.Despite that, a sage was still a sage! It\u2019s a level of existence that towered over billions of living beings.If the Primordial Purple Haze were to be taken out from here, it would drive countless Daoist Cultivators crazy for it!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Then again, judging by how incredibly powerful Honorable Yuan Ling is, I guess that there\u2019s no need for him to use an item like the Primordial Purple Haze.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s just a shame he ended up failing the ascension. Otherwise, based on how strong his battle strength can be after ascending to a Sage, there\u2019s a chance he could have possibly been able to suppress a whole generation.\u201dThe Seventh Forefather lamented.Chu Kuangren heard this and said, \u201cSenior elder, is this item of any benefit to you?\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s alright. You keep it. Having you using this item will be good for you, and giving the other Honorables within our sect would be fine as well. Regardless, it\u2019s much better than wasting on an old fart like me.\u201dThe Seventh Forefather chuckled.However, Chu Kuangren could not help but notice a hint of sorrow in those words.What he did not know was that the Seventh Forefather had already reached the fifth stage of Heavenly Deterioration, his days were already well numbered. Even if the Primordial Purple Haze were to be given to him, he probably would not have the time to ascend properly, and would only have wasted it insteadWithout prodding any further, Chu Kuangren kept the Primordial Purple Haze.He decided to not use the purple colored gas.The fact that ascendancy using the Primordial Purple Haze would produce weak results was due to the amount of foreign Dao accumulated within the user. Chu Kuangren wanted to ascend to become a Sage with his own power!He had the Supreme Daoist Physique and the Supreme Foundation Level. It would not be a problem for him.Since he had decided not to use it, it could be given to the other Honorables of the Black Heaven Sect, like Elder Ruyan and Honorable Xuan Qi.After scouring through the palace hall, Chu Kuangren left no spiritual stone unturned and happily left the area.\u2026Bang!A terrifying beam of sword light burst forward, splitting a ferocious monster in half. Its blood rained down, staining the surrounding forest red.In mid-air, a middle-aged white-robed man was holding a supreme sword that gleamed in overflowing light. He had a stone-cold expression on his face.If there had been anyone from White Cloud city around they would certainly recognize him.The eldest son of White Cloud City\u2019s Lord, Ye Baifeng.\u201cMy lord, I\u2019ve received the report from our scouts, there seems to be a palace located three hundred meters ahead!\u201d Said a swordsman who came suddenly.Ye Baifeng\u2019s eyes sparkled. \u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201dSoon after, he could make out the palace hidden within the depths of a mountain range. His face radiated with ecstasy.\u201cThat must be the location of Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s hidden treasure!\u201cThe Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate must definitely be inside!\u201dJust when Ye Baifeng and his men approached the place.Suddenly, a horrifying roar was heard from a distance.Numerous apes appeared out from the forests of the mountain. Their bodies were covered in black fur, and each of them displayed ferocious intent.One of the apes, which seemed to be the leader of the pack, had its cultivation level at Battle Monarch Level!\u201cD*mn it, all of these demon apes had been completely turned into puppets by the Honorable Yuan Ling. They have no will of their own and they don\u2019t fear death at all. They\u2019re very troublesome to deal with.\u201d\u201cHmph, it\u2019s just a pack of beasts, nothing to be afraid about!\u201d\u201cThe treasury is just in front of us, we can\u2019t withdraw anymore!\u201d\u201cWell said, that is the chance I was waiting for! Attack!\u201d\u201cDefinitely won\u2019t return empty-handed!\u201dThe group of Daoist Cultivators clashed with the apes in an instant.Terrifying surges of energy were released, which swept through the forest and mountains.Ye Baifeng confronted the pack leader. That ape\u2019s battle strength was indeed terrifying, with bloodshot eyes and a fierce fighting spirit, it conjured up a violent stream of spiritual Qi by moving both of its arms.Its battle strength had reached the peak of the Battle Monarch Realm!Although Ye Baifeng was skilled, he could not fight with the ape in a battle of attrition.As time went by, his movements and skill started to slip and decline.The Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasury was just ahead, but the path was blocked by a pack of apes. If they took too long to deal with the beasts, and let other parties sneak ahead of them to the treasure, then it would all be meaningless.When he thought of this, Ye Baifend grit his teeth and took out a silver-white dagger. That was the dagger that his father, the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman had developed. Once used, its power would be equivalent to the strike from the Honorable Swordsman himself.What kind of person was the Honorable Swordsman?An Honorable Supreme!A simple slash from him could take down any Battle Monarch.\u201cI can\u2019t be bothered to care too much. Take this!\u201dYe Baifeng used the silver-white dagger.Within an instant, a gush of horrifying Daoist Rhymes flooded the area, and a thousand-meter-long ray of silver-white sword light came from the sky and locked on the ape king.\u201cRoar!\u201dThe ape king roared towards the sky and tried to block the attack.However, the strike of an Honorable Supreme was enough to shatter mountains and possessed unparalleled amounts of power. The moment the ape king came in contact with the sword\u2019s light beam, it blew up instantly into a bloody mist. The light beam then went through the lands around the mountain.Boom!A loud crackling explosion was heard, the whole artificial world trembled.Large portions of the space that made up the world start to crack and shatter!Everyone who was inside that world was startled and frightened by the sudden occurrence, their face went pale and their pupils shrank.\u201cD*mn, which idiot is that, using an Honorable Supreme\u2019s power in this small artificial world. Is his life too long and comfortable or something?\u201d\u201cThe small artificial world is crumbling apart, there\u2019s not much time left for us here. No point going for the treasury now, our lives are at stake here, we need to leave immediately.\u201d\u201cThe terrifying force generated by the world falling apart is no small joke, it\u2019s hard to survive even for a Supreme one.\u201dThose that knew they had no chance of finding the buried treasure hurriedly left.After all, no matter how attractive the treasures were, they were not as priceless as a person\u2019s life.After Ye Baifeng slew the ape king, the residual Sword Qi that escaped ended up wiping out the rest of the apes as well.\u201cThere\u2019s not much time left, we need to leave!\u201dYe Baifeng took the opportunity and dashed into the palace with his men.What welcomed them was an empty hall within the palace.\u201cHow could this be?\u201d\u201cThe treasures, where are the treasures?\u201dEveryone\u2019s expression changed.After working so hard to clear a path here thinking that piles of treasures awaited them, they did not expect a scene as desolate as this.Ye Baifeng had not given up and sternly said to the others, \u201cDon\u2019t give up, search the area!\u201dThe men used their spiritual thoughts to scan through the area, never missing a single corner. Not long after, they finished searching the palace high and low.Some even dug out the tiles from the ground, finding not even a single spiritual stone, or a single piece of treasure.Soon after, a Daoist cultivator discovered footprints from the stairs of the palace, which meant that someone arrived there before them!The treasure had been snatched away!Ye Baifeng was overcome with anger.He worked so hard to reach this place. Wanting to obtain its treasure, he even used the dagger that was bestowed upon by his father, and now he had nothing left.\u201cWho the hell was it!\u201dHe almost yelled out.Thinking of something, he brought out a white jewel from his Yin and Yang Ring. He had a ray of hope in his eyes. \u201cThis is the Reversal Jewel, it contains a sliver of Time Daoist Rhymes! Being able to backtrack through time, capture, and reveal past events that happened to a certain place.\u201dThis was an item that he acquired in the early days of his training journey. It was in his inventory for a long time, and he had never used it until now.At that point, he could only rely upon that item to help him out.He tossed the Reversal Jewel into mid-air, a mysterious light began to appear and flicker, revealing the scenes that happened.From the scenes, there was a man and a woman. The man was as handsome as an Immortal deity, while the woman who had silver-white hair was remarkably gorgeous.The scene revealed that those two were the ones that looted the treasure here.\u201cTake a look, could that be \u2026 That\u2019s the Primordial Purple Haze!\u201dSuddenly, a Daoist cultivator exclaimed.The scene showed Chu Kuangren opening the wooden box, which had a gust of purple gas inside. That was indeed the Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate, the Primordial Purple Haze.\u201cWho are these two?\u201d\u201cFind out about them now!\u201d\u201cMake sure to find their location, recover the stolen treasures, and get back that Primordial Purple Haze!\u201dYe Baifeng\u2019s eyes were red with anger. That was the Primordial Purple Haze, how could he possibly let it slip through his fingertips. Who could accept that fact if it happened to them?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 33": "Chapter 33: May This Taoist Brother Please Hold Your Step, I Was Just Rambling\u201cThe artificial world is collapsing!\u201dChu Kuangren suddenly sensed a dramatic shift in the dimension.\u201cLet\u2019s leave!\u201d The Seventh Forefather said.The impact from the artificial world\u2019s collapse was something even the Seventh Forefather would not underestimate.Chu Kuangren did not dare delay any further. He quickly left the artificial world with Lan Yu and swiftly dashed away upon arriving in the outer world.The rest of the group who escaped from the artificial world had followed suit.Chu Kuangren, Lan Yu, and the rest traveled a few miles away from Honourable Yuan Ling\u2019s Treasury before they saw the great golden gate shatter in the distance, cracking its immediate surroundings at the same time under the immense force.A tremendous force began to converge in a central core as the surrounding forestry began to be uprooted and sucked into its direction.Immediately, the door shattered into smithereens and formed a miniature black hole. The black hole was merely the size of a fist, yet it radiated energy so terrifying that everyone present felt a menacing pull towards it.The entire artificial world along with everything within a ten-mile radius got sucked into the black holes as it disintegrated everything it touched into mere particles.Then, the black hole finally disappeared.The entire ten-mile radius from where the artificial world was had now been replaced by a huge crater.There was a sense of dilapidation in the air.All the cultivators who had witnessed the collapse of the artificial world felt an indescribable shock. In the face of such a powerful force, a feeling of insignificance began to surface within them.Chu Kuangren took a deep breath and said, \u201cThat was scary.\u201dHowever, Chu Kuangren was still satisfied with the loot he had acquired from this treasure hunting trip.To him, just the Primordial Purple Haze was worth all the effort. Unfortunately, the other cultivators were not as lucky as he was.\u201cDamn it! Not only did I get nothing, I nearly lost my life.\u201d\u201cGosh! What a waste of time.\u201d\u201cSo who found the Yuan Ling Treasury in the end?!\u201d\u201cSpeaking of which, the fact that Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s Treasury appeared is still shrouded behind a mystery. Could something more sinister probably be at play?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re right, whoever\u2019s behind this is cruel enough to destroy the entire artificial world just to get rid of us.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t let me find out who did this, or else\u2026\u201dThere were tones of regret and of anger, whereas some people had even started diving into odd theories behind the incident\u2026Meanwhile, as the culprit behind everything that unraveled, Chu Kuangren remained silent in fear of arousing any unwanted suspicions.He immediately prepared himself to leave this forsaken place with Lan Yu.\u201cTaoist Brother, please hold your step!\u201dChu Kuangren heard a voice attempting to halt his plan.A young man dressed in a white robe came to both of them.Although blessed with handsome features, he was still a far cry away from Chu Kuangren\u2019s attractiveness.The young man was also in disbelief. He did not expect that there would actually be someone more handsome than he was.\u201cI am the Owner of the White Cloud Hotel, Li Xingchen. You both seem like extraordinary people. As such, I wish to make your acquaintance,\u201d Li Xingchen said.His proposal had attracted much attention from people nearby and they all reacted in shock upon noticing Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu.\u201cThis couple looks unordinary, especially for that man. The radiation of his Daoist Rhymes seem to work in mysterious ways, like that of a deity.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t imagine a man like this could exist.\u201d\u201cThat person is Li Xingchen from White Cloud Hotel. Rumor has it that he\u2019s the most attractive man to ever exist in White Cloud City and likes to befriend other attractive people.\u201d\u201cNo wonder he\u2019d approach these two people.\u201d\u201cSuch a remarkable couple. I wonder which sage orthodoxy do they belong to. If I get the chance, I would definitely get to know them better.\u201dChatter started building amongst the crowd while Chu Kuangren looked at Li Xingchen in skepticism. He could also hear what everyone else was discussing.Likes befriending other attractive people?Looks like Li Xingchen was one who only judged others by their looks.\u201cMy name is Chu Kuangren, we\u2019ve met.\u201d\u201cI see, it\u2019s Brother Chu. My memory must have failed\u2026\u201d Before Li Xingchen could complete his words, his face immediately froze.What did he just hear?Chu Kuangren?The Chu Kuangren who had declared war against everyone?!\u201cBrother Li, what\u2019s wrong?\u201dChu Kuangren merely looked at Li Xingchen in confusion, still completely oblivious to the impact created by his spoken words before he descended into the world.Something was not right.He could sense hostility!Chu Kuangren heightened his cautiousness as he observed his surroundings.Upon hearing his name, all the cultivators immediately stared at Chu Kuangren in hostility. The younger cultivators even had provocative grimaces on their faces.\u201cMaster, something\u2019s wrong.\u201dLan Yu was also alerted.\u201cI see that.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded.Then, a young cultivator dressed in black clothes stood to the front. He stared at Chu Kuangren coldly and said, \u201cAre you the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect who declared war against everyone here?!\u201dChu Kuangren was even more confused now. He replied, \u201cI am indeed the Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect. However, I think there may be some misunderstanding. Since when have I declared war against everyone?\u201dBesides, he had just descended into this world.How would he have the capacity to wage war against all these cultivators?He was just an insignificant Nascent Soul cultivator.\u201c\u2018But once I descend upon the realm, I will dominate and defeat them all!\u2019 These were the words you said!\u201d the cultivator said.\u201cIndeed, I\u2019ve said that but\u2026 Wait a minute\u2026\u201dChu Kuangren had a sudden realization.Did these people take his words as a declaration of war? Was this a joke? He was just rambling.There were so many disciples present when he was descending. Even the elders had personally come to send their wishes. Chu Kuangren was merely rambling to look cooler.Only a few days had passed, yet the word had spread so quickly.\u201cSince you\u2019ve uttered those words, then I shall personally teach you a lesson today. Let\u2019s see how long you can remain standing!\u201dThe man in black clothes let out a battle cry and channeled his spiritual energy.The spiritual Qi in the air began to charge itself above and condensed into the shape of an enormous black palm. Then, with its maximum force, the man clapped and sent the palm flying down towards Chu Kuangren.\u201cSupreme Technique, Sky Shadow Enormous Palm!\u201d The black palm seemed to cover the entire sky as it attempted to crush Chu Kuangren. However, before Chu Kuangren even thought of retaliating, Lan Yu immediately countered his moves with an upward fist attack.A beam of light exploded upwards as it penetrated the black palm and scored a direct hit on the black-clothed cultivator. He was immediately sent flying backward as fresh blood spilled from his mouth.All it took was a single fist attack to shock everyone at the scene.Lan Yu looked around her and said coldly, \u201cNone of you have the right to even challenge my master!\u201dChu Kuangren blinked in disbelief. While Lan Yu\u2019s intention was to protect him, he felt those words would probably provoke even more hostility.Indeed, the crowd became even more agitated and unfriendly.\u201cChu Kuangren, what a crazy bastard!\u201d\u201cEven his servant is arrogant, I can\u2019t imagine how delusional Chu Kuangren actually is! No wonder he has the audacity to declare war against the entire world!\u201dMeanwhile, the man who was defeated by Lan Yu was visibly in shock. He was incredulous about what happened.\u201cOne punch! I couldn\u2019t even defend against one punch from his servant!\u201d\u201cIf so, how strong is Chu Kuangren?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid I\u2019m probably as insignificant as an ant to him.\u201dThe cultivator in black had no choice but to concede.At that moment, Chu Kuangren took a quick glance at him.Perhaps it was due to his defeat, but the black-clothed man could not help but feel that Chu Kuangren\u2019s glance was filled with ridicule and even indifference.Indeed, Chu Kuangren merely looked at him for a fraction of a second before he averted his eyes elsewhere.The black-clothed cultivator had never felt as miserable in his life. He muttered, \u201cAfter training so hard for decades, I thought I would at least stand out among my generation. Yet, I\u2019m no more than just an ant to you!\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren, you\u2019re crazy!\u201d\u201cToday, I shall concede my defeat to you\u2026\u201dAs he finished his rambling, the black-clothed man turned around and left. He limped slowly into the sunset, filled with nothing but disappointment and a sense of devastation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34: Frost Dragon Trio Are Just Trash, Stay Out Of Trouble\u201cThe black-clothed cultivator was a Daoist of Iron Hill Sect, an honorable orthodoxy! Yet, he didn\u2019t even stand a chance against Chu Kuangren\u2019s personal maid!\u201d\u201cLooking at him, I\u2019m afraid his Daoist passion has probably been destroyed. He can probably no longer see a future in the Daoist world.\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren is crazy!\u201d\u201cEven though he was challenged by a Daoist, Chu Kuangren completely ignored him and only let his personal maid beat him into hopelessness. We should all be careful of him.\u201dThe crowd soon engaged in another round of discussions.They were all cautious towards Chu Kuangren.On the other hand, Chu Kuangren was even more confused.He was just looking at the black-clothed cultivator to make sure he was okay. How was it that once he averted his sight, the man immediately descended into hopelessness and retreated from the scene?\u201cPfft, the Iron Hill Sect is useless! Let us, the Frost Dragon Trio, properly teach Chu Kuangren a valuable lesson!\u201dAt that moment, three men walked out of the crowd.The trio were all dressed in white Daoist robes, each wielding a supreme weapon in their hands.Chu Kuangren raised his brows slightly.Was it not going to end?Would they only stop once he was reduced to ashes?Chu Kuangren gestured to stop Lan Yu from attacking and said, \u201cLan Yu, I\u2019m the one they\u2019re looking to challenge. Let me handle this on my own.\u201d\u201cMaster, they\u2019re all just chaff waiting to be swept away. Let me handle this.\u201dLan Yu said unreservedly.The Frost Dragon Trio was fuming in anger.\u201cBastard, who are you calling chaff?!\u201d\u201cPfft, I didn\u2019t think a lowly servant would have the audacity to ridicule us after defeating a useless opponent. You should stop daydreaming!\u201dThe Frost Dragon Trio began to curse at her in rage.Chu Kuangren heard their insults and began to unleash a chilling gaze.Even Chu Kuangren had never scolded Lan Yu himself, yet they were now mocking her in every way possible. It was unforgivable! Chu Kuangren began to feel anger himself.\u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s responsibility to protect the environment. I\u2019ll be more than glad to sweep them up myself.\u201dChu Kuangren said nonchalantly and took a big step forward.\u201cFool, we\u2019ll let you know what actual chaff is!\u201d\u201cHmmph!\u201dThe Frost Dragon Trio noticed his provocation and immediately unleashed their moves.The trio began radiating Daoist Rhymes that were almost identical to one another. Generous amounts of spiritual power filled the void and blanketed the earth.Suddenly, there was a dramatic shift in the realm.The atmospheric temperature soon began to drop and a blizzard descended upon them!The air was so cold that it could easily pierce through one\u2019s skin like a dagger.\u201cThis is a spell cast concurrently by the three of us, the Blizzard Spell! Even a Paradise Realm cultivator would have problems escaping from us!\u201dThe leader of the Frost Dragon Trio began laughing menacingly.To have the audacity to challenge Chu Kuangren, the trio unsurprisingly had some tricks up their sleeves. Besides owning a decent cultivation base, by working together, the trio could channel a spell so powerful that very few peers of their generation could overcome.Chu Kuangren reached out to grab a snowflake.Like a sharp dagger, the snowflake pierced his finger and left a wound behind.However, thanks to Chu Kuangrean\u2019s Immortal Body, the wound swiftly healed on its own.\u201cI\u2019m curious, why are you all so eager to challenge me? Is it just because I said those few words before I descended here?\u201d Chu Kuangren said calmly.One of the members from the Frost Dragon Trio sneered, \u201cNot only have your words spread throughout the entire Firmament Star, but everyone also knows that you defeated Gu Changge and they see you as the ultimate genius. In that case, who doesn\u2019t want to defeat you?\u201d\u201cOnce we defeat you, our reputation shall surely flourish throughout the entire kingdom!\u201dWhich young person would not love to have a bit of fame for themselves?The Frost Dragon Trio were no exceptions.Moreover, the best way to succeed quickly was to often step on another person to ascend the ladder.It was just like how Chu Kuangren had gained his reputation after defeating Gu Changge. Otherwise, his provocations would have meant nothing to them.His words could carry credibility only because of his reputation.Now, the Frost Dragon Trio was planning to gain their fame by defeating Chu Kuangren!\u201cI see the reason now,\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded slightly.\u201cThen die!\u201dThe Frost Dragon Trio let out a loud battle cry. As the Blizzard Spell\u2019s intensity increased, countless snowflakes flew directly towards Chu Kuangren from all directions.Then, Chu Kuangren shifted his focus onto his next move.\u201cNine Heaven Sword Prison.\u201dIt was only a soft battle cry.Streams of Sword Qi were summoned from within his body.The chaotic blizzard instantly became quiet!Like a thin layer of a sheet, the blizzard spell seemed to tear itself apart under the incessant weight of Sword Qi!The streams of Sword Qi interacted with one another and manifested themselves into twelve pillars of Sword Qi, forming a Sword Qi territory that resembled a prison!\u201cHow\u2019s this possible?!\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?!\u201d\u201cOur spells were shattered within a split of a second!\u201dThe Frost Dragon Trio members\u2019 faces immediately turned pale.They had long known that Chu Kuangren was a formidable opponent. Otherwise, he would not have defeated Gu Changge.Therefore, the trio decided to work together.They were of the opinion that with their spells, the trio could outnumber and put on a match against Chu Kuangren.In fact, they thought they could even defeat Chu Kuangren!Yet, they were wrong. They had made a grave mistake!Within a moment\u2019s time, their spells were broken and they had subsequently fallen into Chu Kuangren\u2019s trap, unable to do anything except to wait for their demise!\u201cTrash!\u201d Chu Kuangren said.Then, he softly closed his fingers.The Sword Qi within the Sword Qi territory began to behave erratically and started attacking the trio!Their screams echoed throughout the territory.Each individual of the trio was only a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator. Even if they combined their abilities, it was only on par with that of a common Paradise Realm cultivator.Gu Changge could have handled their abilities with ease, what more Chu Kuangren, who had defeated Gu Changge with a single move.All it took was a single Daoist Physique Transformation.\u201cNo!\u201dAn elderly person was seen rushing out of the crowd as he let out a loud shriek. Watching the collapsed corpses of the Frost Dragon Trio, his eyes had turned red in anger. The elder was the Daoist Protector of the Frost Dragon Trio.When Chu Huangren was unleashing the Nine Heaven Sword Prison, he had already intended to interfere. However, Chu Kuangren had moved so swiftly that the protector did not have a chance to react and the trio immediately died.\u201cChu Kuangren, I\u2019ll kill you!\u201dThe elder person was engulfed in rage, instantly activating his Battle Monarch posture.Then, a soft grunt sounded in the air.The elder\u2019s body immediately exploded from within into a bloody mist!The sight was enough to shock the wits out of the remaining spectators.Even a Battle Monarch did not stand even the slightest chance before he was disintegrated into a bloody mist. What kind of terrifying power did this man possess?!\u201cAn Honorable! This is the working of an Honorable!\u201d\u201cIndeed. In fact, it\u2019s probably one of the greatest cultivators in the Honorable Realm!\u201d\u201cLegend has it that Chu Kuangren is a Supreme Daoist Physique. It\u2019s no surprise that the Black Heaven Sect would arrange for a Daoist Protector to accompany him wherever he goes!\u201d\u201cThis Daoist Protector is definitely an Honorable!\u201dThose who initially intended to provoke Chu Kuangren immediately changed their minds.Aside from Chu Kuangren\u2019s abilities which had been put on display, they were even more cautious towards his Honorable Realm Daoist Protector.Chu Kuangren recalled his Sword Qi, looked at the crowd, and said, \u201cIf anyone else wishes to challenge me, I\u2019ll gladly accept.\u201cHowever, do take my advice\u2026 And stay out of trouble!\u201dBesides punishing them for insulting Lan Yu, Chu Kuangren had also brutally murdered the Frost Dragon Trio as a warning to the rest.Otherwise, it would be troublesome if people were to come to challenge him every single day.When the time called for tough actions, Chu Kuangren was never one to show mercy.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35: In Heaven The White Jade City Lies, A Display For Everyone\u2019s AppreciationAfter Chu Kuangren brutally murdered the Frost Dragon Trio, no one else present dared make rash decisions anymore. Their ambitions had been overcome by a sense of fear.Having killed the Frost Dragon Trio with ease as well as being accompanied by an Honourable Realm cultivator, Chu Kuangren could basically roam fearlessly throughout the entire Azure Dragon Domain. The only thing he had to be concerned about was perhaps the sages.\u201cWhat a fantastic show!\u201d Li Xingchen came clapping and continued, \u201cBrother Chu\u2019s ability is indeed eye-opening.\u201d\u201cOh, are you not afraid, Brother Li?\u201d Chu Kuangren said.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to be afraid of? It was the Frost Dragon Trio who first offended you, so be it if they die,\u201d Li Xingchen spoke nonchalantly about the incident. He was not bothered at all by the fate of the trio.In reality, the White Jade Hotel of the White Cloud City had its own secluded network and they were not afraid to offend some Honorable Orthodoxies.\u201cIf there\u2019s nothing else, I shall make a move.\u201dChu Kuangren said.\u201cBrother Chu, White Cloud City is just nearby. The White Jade Hotel is an established institution of the city after all, why not come and rest for a few days?\u201d Li Xingchen said excitingly.Li Xingchen had initially wanted to only greet Chu Kuangren simply because he was impressed by Kuangren\u2019s demeanor and appearance. However, after knowing his true identity, he was sincere in making an acquaintance with Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren was both the embodiment of Supreme Daoist Physique as well as the Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect. He was both reputable and influential across the entire Firmament Star.\u201cWhite Jade Hotel\u2026 Sure then.\u201dChu Kuangren nodded.After all, he had come out to gain some exposure and training. It did not matter where he conducted his training. Since White Cloud City was just nearby, there was no harm checking it out.Furthermore, he was also curious about the legendary Honorable Swordsman White Cloud.\u201cIn that case, this way, Brother Chu.\u201dLi Xingchen hastily guided the way.During the journey, Li Xingchen introduced much of White Cloud City\u2019s culture and political climate to Chu Kuangren.The topic naturally included discussing a figure that intrigued Chu Kuangren a lot, Honorable Swordsman White Cloud.According to Li Xingchen, Honorable Swordsman had isolated himself in meditation for sixty years now. It was unknown when he would eventually complete his meditation. The management of White Cloud City was handled by his three sons. They were addressed as the Eldest Master, Second Master, and Third Master respectively by the people.Although White Cloud City was just a city, the land it occupied was vast and could rival that of a small kingdom.As a result, White Cloud City was also a host to many cultivator organizations that were primarily dojos and family sects. These organizations were all supervised by the mayoral office.Yet, there was a place within White Cloud City that was an exception.It was a special place that laid beyond the grasp of the mayoral office. That place was precisely the White Jade Hotel.Soon enough, Chu Kuangren and Li Xingchen had both arrived at the White Jade Hotel. They were greeted by a group of high-rise buildings that were built closely together such that they resembled a wave of varying heights.A majestic palace, delicate residences, a manmade forest, a rooftop bar, and many others all laid within the confines of these structures.Outside the gate of White Jade Hotel, Chu Kuangren could not help but recite a poem, \u201cIn heaven the White Jade City lies, Of twelve towers and five gates it comprises; As the goddess grants his gifts, my soul rejuvenates and my spirit it lifts.\u201dLi Xingchen\u2019s eyes immediately widened in admiration and he said, \u201cBrother Chu, what an amazing poem!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re flattering me.\u201dChu Kuangren replied humbly.He was after all a liberal arts student in his past life. Reciting poems from famous poets as his own seemed fun.\u201cIn heaven the White Jade City lies, Of twelve towers and five gates it comprises; As the goddess grants his gifts; my soul rejuvenates and my spirit it lifts. What a beautiful poem.\u201dLi Xingchen could not resist reciting it a couple more times. The more he did, the smoother it flowed, the more he was convinced that the poem was authentically written to describe the White Jade Hotel.Was White Jade City not referring to White Jade Hotel?\u2018Of twelve towers and five gates it comprises\u2019 was obviously a reference to the multitude of buildings in White Jade Hotel, was it not?\u2018As the goddess grants his gifts; my soul rejuvenates and my spirit it lifts.\u2019Goddess, a goddess\u2026Li Xingchen took a quick glance at Chu Kuangren and noticed the extraordinary aura he emitted. He indeed possessed the demeanor of a god.Hehe, was Brother Chu referencing himself as a god?Such audacity was indeed extraordinary.Chu Kuangren was completely unaware of how far Li Xingchen\u2019s imagination had taken him. Instead, he merely noticed that Li Xingchen had stared at him in increased admiration and respect.The White Jade Hotel provided a wide array of services to its customers. It had its own restaurants, hotels, casinos, and even brothels. It was the busiest place in the entire White Cloud City.The place was crowded and packed with visitors.\u201cGreetings, Young Master.\u201dSomeone greeted Li Xingchen upon seeing him.Chu Kuangren then learned that Li Xingchen was the son of the owner of White Jade Hotel.Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu had also attracted much curious attention from the visitors.Their association with Li Xingchen was not the only reason people were curious. Just Chu Kuangren\u2019s extraordinary aura was enough to attract gazes from the crowd.\u201cWho is that man? He looks like someone formidable.\u201d\u201cIs he Young Master\u2019s friend?\u201d\u201cThe Young Master was already the most famous handsome person in the entire White Cloud City. Who would have thought that there exists someone even more attractive than him?\u201d\u201cAnd that silver-haired lady is so beautiful!\u201d\u201cCompared to the previous guests Young Master has hosted, these two definitely raise the bar.\u201dThe crowd soon engaged in gossip and discussions.It was well-known that Li Xingchen had always wanted to befriend other attractive people. Visitors and staff had also long been accustomed to him hosting these people around.Yet, his guests this time were absolutely stellar.Compared to Chu Kuangren, his previous guests now seemed ordinary and boring in comparison. It was not even a close match.Amid the curious gazes, Li Xingchen finally brought the duo into a study room where the owner of White Jade Hotel was residing.He looked like a middle-aged man in his thirties. His demeanor was gentle and softspoken but his aura was threatening. He looked just like an ordinary scholar.However, could the owner of the White Jade Hotel actually just be an ordinary scholar?Chu Kuangren could not resist the temptation and used the Remarkable Eye of Revelation.\u201cLi Ye. Honorable Realm cultivator. Skilled in the art of calligraphy\u2026\u201dChu Kuangren was instantly shocked.Indeed, he was no ordinary scholar.What a lad, he was actually an Honorable Cultivator! Every Honorable was considered a formidable fighter in the Firmament Star.\u201cFather, these are my new friends.\u201dLi Xingchen introduced Chu Kuangren and Lanyu to his father.Li Ye raised his head and was initially shocked when he saw the duo. In fact, the more he stared at the duo, the more apparent his shock became.His cultivation was strong and could easily sense the terrifying Daoist rhymes that were hidden within their bodies. Li Ye could tell that they possessed powerful Daoist Physiques.This was especially true for Chu Kuangren, whose presence had made him astonished.It was Li Ye\u2019s first time seeing Daoist rhymes of that sort.\u201cMay I ask, where do you both come from?\u201d\u201cI am Chu Huangren from the Black Heaven Sect, her name is Lan Yu. It\u2019s a pleasure meeting you,\u201d Chu Huangren politely greeted Li Ye.\u201cChu Kuangren\u2026\u201d LI Ye muttered. He then proceeded to let out a soft laugh. \u201cSo you\u2019re the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect who has declared war against the entire kingdom.\u201dChu Kuangren scratched his nose. He could not deny the incident.After all that happened, it almost seemed like this rumor was already established in reality.However, Chu Kuangren did feel a sense of pleasure once he embraced the rumor.\u201cThe Honorable hidden in that corner must be your Daoist Protector.\u201d Li Ye could also sense Seventh Forefather\u2019s presence.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cOkay,\u201d Li Ye did not speak any further.Li Xingchen excitedly shared with his father, \u201cToday, Brother Chu has recited a poem in dedication to White Jade Hotel. In heaven the White Jade City lies, Of twelve towers and five gates it comprises; As the goddess grants his gifts; my soul rejuvenates and my spirit it lifts. What do you think?\u201dLi Ye\u2019s face brightened up upon hearing the recital of that poem. He let out a hearty laugh and said, \u201cWhat wonderful poem. Who would have thought our friend would have brought such great gifts on his day here. Thank you.\u201dLi Ye was skilled in calligraphy. Although he was not particularly talented in reciting poems himself, he was fond of listening to them. He immediately became fond of Chu Kuangren upon hearing his poem.\u201cI shall personally convert this poem to calligraphy and display it at the busiest area of White Jade Hotel for everyone to appreciate.\u201dLi Ke said happily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36: The Scepter Of Light, Some Hidden Secrets, And A Sparkling DebutAfter hearing Chu Kuangren\u2019s poem, Li Ye\u2019s impression of him greatly improved. In addition to his reputation as an esteemed senior of the Black Heaven Sect, he was immediately treated as a VIP with Li Xingchen attending to him.Xingchen assigned the most luxurious suite in White Cloud Hotel to Kuangren. It was so high class that even Kuangren himself wondered if it were some emperor\u2019s grand palace.\u201cShall I arrange a banquet for you tonight, Senior Chu? I shall invite and introduce the young talents of the city to you as well.\u201dXingchen was most excited.\u201cSure.\u201d Kuangren faintly nodded.Inside the posh suite, Kuangren was organizing the bounty from his treasure hunt.As he looked at the dazzling array of treasures inside the Yin and Yang Ring, he unwittingly frowned. \u201cThis is just way too messy\u2026\u201dPotions, weapons, classical books, etc. All the treasure was just randomly stuffed in here, and for someone with mild OCD like Kuangren, it was rather unbearable. Thus, he tidied it up.Since Honorable Yuan Ling just had way too many treasures, it took him almost half an hour to finish.\u201cThe Fantasy Roulette\u2019s space is still more convenient after all.\u201dThen, Kuangren had a thought. That space was an inventory space. As long as he did not take anything out, the same items would be arranged together in order.Despite being tired, looking at his neatly organized treasures made him grin unwittingly.\u201cThat treasure hunt was so worth it!\u201dBeside him, Lan Yu could not help but faintly smile when she saw how happy Kuangren was.\u201cRight, Lan Yu. This is for you.\u201dHe took out a white scepter.That scepter was the very same one that Lan Yu had her eyes on in the vault.It was pure white, donned with a bedazzling sun-like halo that was engraved with runes. A shining light emanated from it.This was the weapon of a saint.Lan Yu\u2019s eyes sparkled with mirth but she remained where she was, hesitant to take it.Kuangren saw her hesitation and shoved the scepter straight into her hands. \u201cTake it. I\u2019m not short of sacred weapons and the scepter would do you more good than me.\u201dTo the average cultivator, a sacred weapon was the most powerful item ever, even a saintly cultivator would not have more than a few.However, to Kuangren it was just a weapon after all.He only took the Descendant Self Sword from Sword Mountain and nothing else, if not he could have had a sword in each hand while the rest could be thrown around for fun.Still, he kept those thoughts to himself.If the Protectors in hiding heard him they would burn him in rage for saying such blasphemous words against the sacred swords.\u201cThank you, Master.\u201d Lan Yu did not protest further and inspected the scepter.The scepter vibrated slightly as if it were letting out a cry of joy before turning into a light orb and fusing with Lan Yu.It had chosen its master.\u201cLooks like the sacred weapon likes you!\u201d Chu Kuangren grinned.She suddenly felt a wave of information rush into her head. \u201cThis staff is known as the Scepter of Light. It belonged to a Sage Ruler and hero named the Holy King 50 thousand years ago.\u201d\u201cA Sage Ruler weapon?!\u201d Chu Kuangren was shocked.Just like Sages themselves, the Sage weapons were also split into 3 categories.Normal Sage weapons, Great Sage weapons, and Sage Ruler weapons.The weapons that were in the Black Heaven Sect were all normal Sage weapons. Their names had a one-word difference but their power levels could not be more different.\u201cIn the past, it was a Sage Ruler weapon but after a huge war, the Scepter of Light was damaged and is only a normal Sage weapon now.\u201d\u201cWhat kind of war could damage a Sage Ruler weapon so much?!\u201dLan Yu frowned. \u201cThat war was just too horrific. Some of the images are too much even for me. Some parts are fuzzy and blurred out, but there were a lot of Sages fighting and killing each other.\u201dWith that sentence, even the Seventh Forefather in hiding was shocked, let alone Chu Kuangren.Just what were the Sages?Known as an almighty existence that ruled over billions of creatures, even the noblest creatures bowed before the Sages.To think that Lan Yu said she saw countless Sages brutally murdering each other!This was incomprehensible!Kuangren felt like he had very briefly seen the tip of the iceberg that held every secret in this world.\u201cInteresting\u2026\u201d he smiled but did not put too much thought into it. The way he was now, he was not ready to face those secrets.\u2026Nighttime.Moonlit Balcony, White Cloud Hotel.This was one of the highest vantage points in the hotel, and the view of the moon at night was breathtaking, hence the name Moonlit Balcony.It was also the place where Li Xingchen hosted his banquets.On this very night, the Moonlit Balcony was filled with young talents that Li Xingchen invited. Many of which were from aristocratic families.\u201cLi Xingchen said he was going to introduce someone to us. I wonder who could be so important that it warrants so much effort.\u201dA particular young lad was curious.\u201cAh, he\u2019s always like this. Every time a new and good-looking cultivator comes along he immediately befriends and introduces them. This is likely no different.\u201dAnother young man laughed softly.\u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. When I got here I heard some people gossiping in the lobby that he\u2019s bringing 2 cultivators. It stunned them all.\u201d A young man in white robes said indifferently.What good was a pretty face in the world of cultivators?With no power, one was reduced to a mere plaything for other people.\u201cOn the other hand, I\u2019m more interested in Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasure vault that shook half the population of the Azure Dragon Domain\u201d\u201cIndeed, I heard that the Honorable Swordsman elder also went but it seemed to be a futile trip. Do you know anything, Ye Lei?\u201dThe crowd turned to the young man called Ye Lei.He took a sip of wine and gently shook his head. \u201cSince I didn\u2019t personally go there, I don\u2019t know what happened inside the vault.\u201d\u201cDid your father tell you anything?\u201d Another young man asked.Ye Lei was the son of the extremely talented Ye Baifeng. He was a second to none Sky-pride level cultivator in the main city.Ye Lei fell silent for a while before shaking his head.The crowd decided to not push any further.Ye Lei continued sipping his wine, deep in thought.He actually did know something.For instance, the vault was emptied by a guy and a girl. Due to that, Ye Baifeng went home empty-handed and filled with rage.These were family secrets though. It would reflect ill on him to spill what he knew.Still, he was curious.Just what kind of person could have taken everything from under the noses of so many strong heroes and cultivators?At the same time, Li Xingchen walked onstage.Behind him were a guy and a girl that followed him on stage into the moonlight.One wore a white robe with wide sleeves and a jade crown on his head. He had an otherworldly aura like a celestial being.They wore a blue and white dress and silver-haired shawl. Her skin was smooth and beautiful, her delicate face looked like a goddess that just descended from the moon.When walking beside those two, the normally prestigious pretty-boy Li Xingchen looked like a peasant.The crowd stared at the pair on stage as if they were in a trance and time had stopped.Only when one of the guest\u2019s wine glass fell and shattered did the crowd snap back to reality.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 37": "Chapter 37: The Golden Lotus Poses A Test, At Full Power, All The Petals Will Bloom The Best\u201cTo think that someone as godly as them exists!\u201d\u201cWho are they?\u201d\u201cNo wonder Li Xingchen wanted to host a banquet for them!\u201d\u201cWow, Xingchen is one of the world\u2019s top pretty-boys but standing beside them makes him look like nothing.\u201d\u201cTheir every move feels like they have some sort of natural connection to the flow of the universe. It\u2019s so otherworldly. Where do they come from?!\u201dThe crowd returned to their senses and gasped at Kuangren and Lan Yu.This pair was absolutely stunning.Especially Kuangren, the aura that emanated from him was extraordinary, even the most esteemed Sages could not rival him.\u201cAllow me to introduce them. This is an esteemed senior of the Black Heaven Sect, Chu Kuangren. This young lady is Miss Lan Yu.\u201d Li Xingchun smiled.Silence swept across the crowd when they heard what he said.The same Chu Kuangren that came to this world and declared war on everyone?!People stared at him curiously. Especially a few talented sky-pride level cultivators staring with eagerness in their eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s the one that defeated the Royal Azure\u2019s Gu Changge!\u201d\u201cSo this is how he looks like\u2026\u201d\u2026\u201cCome, Senior Chu, Lady Lan, please take a seat.\u201d Li Xingchen prepared seats for them right beside him and his family.The banquet began and dancers came onstage to perform.The crowd seemed to be conversing happily in the harmonious atmosphere.\u201cBrother Chu, come. Let\u2019s toast.\u201dThey raised their glasses and made a toast to Chu Kuangren.He returned a smile and clinked glasses before downing the wine, laughing heartily.Chu Kuangren suddenly felt a gaze on him.He looked over and saw a young man in white robes.Ye Lei realized he was seen and froze before quickly smiling at Chu Kuangren and averting his gaze.He thought to himself, \u2018So it was them!\u2019The one that cleaned out Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasury was Chu Kuangren!When Ye Baifeng returned, he ordered someone to paint a portrait of the person that took the treasures, and Ye Lei saw the picture.Despite the silhouette not looking exactly like Chu Kuangren, the features were similar enough that it was almost certainly him.This was a big deal and he dared not speak up at the moment, so he could only pretend to be unbothered but it. Ye Lei would wait to return home before informing his seniors.\u201cThis guy is a little weird.\u201dChu Kuangren muttered to himself before disregarding it.\u201cHaha! Word is that brother Chu is the most supreme Daoist and is one of the best Sky-prides around! Would I have the privilege of witnessing your prowess?\u201dOne of the sky-pride cultivators could not resist saying.The crowd also expectantly looked towards Chu Kuangren.Naturally, they were all deeply curious about his abilities.Before Chu Kuangren could respond though, Li Xingchen smiled and cut in, \u201cI wanted to host this banquet since everyone is constantly fighting. It gets a bit meaningless.\u201cBut, I do have a rather rare treasure here.\u201dWith that, he pulled out a golden, oval object from his inventory. The object had a bunch of small slits on it as if they were shimmering petals that came together to form a flower bud.The crowd stared at Li Xingchun, waiting for an explanation.He continued, \u201cThis is the test of the Golden Lotus. It\u2019s a new plaything that Master Windbeard came up with. It can measure the spiritual power and origins of a cultivator, so let\u2019s try it out tonight!\u201dA cultivator\u2019s spiritual power and type determined the technique, qualifications, basics, etc. that a cultivator honed.Within the same school, those with high spiritual quality could have a great advantage!\u201cIt\u2019s Master Windbeard huh? Alright then, I shall comply with brother Li.\u201dWindbeard was White Cloud City\u2019s most famous weapons master. Every weapon he produced was a treasure that was highly sought after.Countless people came to him requesting a weapon to be made.\u201cSo, how do we use this?\u201d\u201cJust unleash your spiritual power and you\u2019ll do the trick.\u201d Li Xingchen said.\u201cThen I shall go first.\u201dA sky-pride level cultivator volunteered.He extended his arm and punched the Golden Lotus.The lotus vibrated and 3 petals unfurled.A moment later, the petals curled back in.\u201c3 petals? Is that good or bad?\u201d\u201cMaster Windbeard said that the Golden Lotus has 12 petals in total. People with the highest spiritual power and quality can open all 12 petals, and those people are as rare as diamonds.The cultivator that volunteered froze. Out of 12 petals, he only opened 3? Was his spiritual power that weak?\u201cAgain!\u201dThe man was unsatisfied and punched again with greater force, but the results were the same.The others roared with laughter but this test did pique their curiosity and one by one, the crowd came to try their hand at the Golden Lotus.\u201cI only get 3 petals as well?\u201d\u201cSigh, 4 petals\u201d\u201cIs there really someone that can unfurl all 12 petals?\u201d\u201cEven with my level of cultivation, I can only get 5!\u201dThe crowd was flabbergasted.The Golden Lotus held such high standards in terms of purity of spiritual power!The person the volunteered felt a little better about himself after he saw that everyone else was about the same level.Then, a burst of Sword Qi hit the Golden Lotus, and with a hum, 6 petals slowly unfurled.This was the best result yet.Ye Lei, who was the one that created the burst of Qi, frowned. He was not happy with the results.He was a true Daoist with the utmost dedication to his training and techniques. Not to mention that he often obtained treasures from far and wide, and his spiritual power was nothing to be laughed at.To him, at least 7 petals should have unfurled.Instead, he only got 6.\u201cAllow me to try as well.\u201d Li Xingchen spoke up, and a burst of light that looked like a star hit the Golden Lotus.The Golden Lotus vibrated and unfurled 6 petals.\u201cAs expected, it\u2019s still 6.\u201d Xingchen smiled and shook his head. It made sense that he had tried it before since it belonged to him.\u201cSigh. Even with brother Li, it\u2019s still 6 petals. The Golden Lotus has really high standards.\u201d\u201cLooks like there\u2019s no one that can ever unfurl 12 petals.\u201d\u201cI wonder how many brother Chu and lady Lan can get?\u201dThe crowd cast their gazes on Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu, who had not tried their hand at the Lotus yet.Lan Yu went first and her fist lit up as she punched. Instantly, the Golden Lotus hummed and 9 petals unfurled. The crowd was dumbfounded.Ye Lei and Li Xingchen\u2019s eyes narrowed slightly.The two of them were esteemed Daoists and only unfurled 6 petals but Lan Yu unfurled 9!This level and purity of her spiritual power far outmatched theirs.The Golden Lotus returned to a bud once more and Chu Kuangren was the last to unleash his burst of Sword Qi.Instantly, a burst of light hit the Golden Lotus and the petals began slowly unfurling.All 12 petals bloomed perfectly. Once it bloomed, a strange fragrance filled the area.\u201cIt\u2019s all open!\u201d\u201cJust what is this level of pure spiritual power?!\u201d\u201cMy god, to think there was actually someone that could unfurl all 12 petals! Brother Chu truly has the abilities of a godly Daoist!\u201dThe crowd went wild, staring at Kuangren with awe.Among the crowd were also people that were utterly crushed that they could only unfurl 3 or 4 petals, but for Chu Kuangren to be able to unfurl all 12? They simply could not come close!\u201cTo think the difference between us was that big!!\u201d Ye Lei gripped his wine glass until his knuckles turned white. His eyes flared with hatred.The sound of glass shattering was heard and the wine glass broke, leaving wine all over the floor.Unfortunately, the crowd was too enamored by the Golden Lotus to take notice of him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 38": "Chapter 38: A Banquet Bluff, The Seventh Forefather Comes OutThe twelve petals of the golden lotus bloomed as a certain fragrance was released into the air.After a while, the golden lotus slowly closed up.The crowd stared at both Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu with unbelief and marvel. There was no question about it, these two were currently the best Sky-prides in the world.When they thought of this, the crowd could not help but sigh.The heavens were playing favorites. On top of their unparalleled talent in cultivation and spiritual practices, they were also blessed with outstanding looks.Then again, comparing oneself to others would always end up leading to dissatisfaction.Suddenly, the wonderfully prepared meal and drinks in front of the crowd seemed tasteless and dull.They were obviously taken aback, and not by just a little bit, either.\u201cOh, I almost forgot to mention, there\u2019s a new type of liquor that was brewed from my White Jade Hotel. I\u2019ll go get it and let everyone try it out. \u201dOut of nowhere, Li Xingchen laughed and said.He noticed something wrong in the air and was trying to lighten the mood.Fortunately, thanks to his actions, the crowd regained their lost vigor. After some more socializing and chatter, the banquet ended successfully.\u2026The morning of the second day.Chu Kuangren woke up from his spiritual practice.As was his routine, he summoned the Fantasy Roulette and began to make some rolls.Iron grade items and a hundred Top-tier soulstones.This was approximately the entire net worth of a normal Daoist cultivator.Chu Kuangren did not even bat an eye and tossed them into his Yin and Yang Ring on top of the growing pile of similar soulstones. He then started to begin another boring day.After leaving his room, he was invited to join Li Xingchen together for breakfast.During that time, he witnessed a group of people gathering around the hall.They seemed to be gathering at the sight of something.Upon walking over to take a closer look, he realized that they were all staring at some words on the wall.\u201cIn the heavens the White Jade City lies, Of twelve towers and five gates it comprises; As the goddess grants his gifts, My soul rejuvenates and my spirit it lifts\u2026 Nicely written, what a good poem.\u201d\u201cDoesn\u2019t the White Jade City here refer to the White Jade Hotel? With the magnificence of this building, it can even be known as a land of fairies on earth.\u201d\u201cWait a minute, take a look at the name of the signature, that\u2019s the name of Chu Kuangren. This poem was made by Chu Kuangren himself, the one and only Chu Kuangren that challenged everyone in the word?\u201d\u201cTo think that the guy has a talent in poetry\u2026\u201dEveryone in the crowd was deep in discussion.In their eyes, the arrogant and overconfident Chu Kuangren who descended into the world and challenged everyone was only someone who was all talk and no show.However, that beautifully written poem that described the beauty and grandeur of the White Jade Hotel was filled with such poetic talent that everyone found it hard to associate it with someone like Chu Kuangren.For a while, everyone was in surprise and lament as well.\u201cWow, they actually framed it up huh?\u201dChu Kuangren took a glance at the words on the wall and left.Following that, under the guidance of Li Xingchen, Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu went out and had a good time in White Cloud City.When they returned to White Jade hotel, an old housekeeper went up to Chu Kuangren, handed him an invitation letter, and said, \u201cMaster Chu, this is an invitation from the city hall. They wish to invite you to attend a banquet tomorrow.\u201d\u201cOh, the people in White Cloud city are quite enthusiastic and friendly, aren\u2019t they?\u201dChu Kuangren took the letter and chuckled.A banquet was just hosted yesterday night, and today someone had invited him again.It was fine regardless.Might as well pay a visit, it was just that the Honorable Swordsman White Cloud had been in meditation for quite a long time. It seemed that the chances of actually seeing him in person would be very small.\u2026At the city hall, people were busy coming and going on about their usual routines.Outside the gates, an old man could be seen looking around for someone.When he saw a man and a woman approaching, the old man\u2019s eyes lit up. He then walked towards, smiled, and greeted them.\u201cMaster Chu, Lady Lan, come, please enter.\u201d\u201cHmm, were you standing here purposely to wait for us?\u201d\u201cYes of course.\u201dA strange color flashed across Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes.With his Eye of Revelation, he could see the information about this old man, and using that eye, he realized that the old man was a person of the Battle Monarch cultivation level.Asking a Battle Monarch to wait outside the city hall shows that the city\u2019s lord either has a large amount of wealth and power, or that he values the old man a lot, or that something was going on.Chu Kuangren knew something was strange about this.He could not, however, think of what benefit the city\u2019s lord would gain should something happen to him.When they entered the city hall, the banquet was already prepared and set up.At the lobby, three men were looking at Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu. Those three were Ye Baifeng and his brothers.\u201cI have long heard that the strongest of the Black Heaven Sect is a remarkable Sky-pride whose talents are a rare find in this world. Having also the poise of a Young Emperor, meeting you today really is an extraordinary sight.\u201dYe Baifeng laughed.\u201cYou exaggerate, my senior.\u201d Said Chu Kuangren as he smiled gently.\u201cOh right, two days before this the whereabouts of Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasury was revealed, and I heard that brother Chu also went in and explored the area, did you manage to manage to gain anything?\u201dAt that moment, Ye Baifeng made sure to be indirect.However, Chu Kuangren\u2019s expression was unchanged and his heart was calm. Having a disappointing and sorrowful look on his face, he replied. \u201cAlthough I did enter, alas, I didn\u2019t manage to retrieve anything.\u201dWhen he heard this, Ye Baifeng\u2019s forehead popped a vein.\u2018Nothing to be gained?\u2018You emptied that entire treasury.\u2018Yet you dare tell me that there was nothing you gained? How shameless could you be!\u2019\u201cMy friend, that can\u2019t be! Your talents and skills are strong and plenty. It is possible that you really did not retrieve anything at all?\u201d Ye Baifeng said, putting up a friendly fa\u00e7ade.\u201cAlas, we really hadn\u2019t.\u201dChu Kuangren shook his head and replied in frustration.At this point, Ye Baifeng\u2019s face began to turn grim, his tone started to become cold. \u201cMy friend, I\u2019m going to ask you one more time, did you gain anything from the treasury or not ?!\u201dChu Kuangren did not wish to speak any further.He had already figured out the true intention of this bluff of a banquet.The one thing that he could not understand was how this Ye Baifeng knew that he took everything from Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasury.\u201cYou already have the answer yourself, why bother asking?\u201dChu Kuangren uttered.\u201cAlright buddy, since that\u2019s the case, then let\u2019s cut to the chase. The Ye family wants the Primordial Purple Haze, we\u2019re even willing to trade it with hundreds of thousands of Top-tier soulstones. If you agree to this request, you, my good friend, shall be an honored guest of the Ye family.\u201d\u201cWhat do you think?\u201dAfter speaking, Ye Baifeng stared menacingly at Chu Kuangren.\u201cI think you have brain damage.\u201dChu Kuangren sneered.Hundreds of thousands of Top-tier soulstones for a Primordial Purple Haze?Even setting aside the mountains of Top-tier soulstones within Chu Kuangren\u2019s Yin and Yang ring, was the Primordial Purple Haze alone worth those hundreds of thousands of Top-tier soulstones?People would fight for that kind of item even if it cost millions of Top-tier soulstones.\u201cSuch foolhardy courage!\u201d\u201cHow dare you insult the Eldest Master, you should die!\u201dDespite facing everyone\u2019s anger and judgment, Chu Kuangren was calm.Even the Second Master spoke, \u201cListen here Chu, this here is the Ye family\u2019s home. Don\u2019t blame us for taking action if you reject our offer.\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s grinned. \u201cI want to see you try.\u201d\u201cHmph, stop talking nonsense, attack!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s kill him here and now, and get the Primordial Purple Haze!\u201dThe allure of the Primordial Purple Haze was too strong.It was so strong that most of the people here were blinded by desire and forgot that Chu Kuangren was of the Black Heaven sect. They fearlessly charged towards him.Several bursts of spiritual power emanated, and various Daoist Rhymes were released. All of them locked onto Chu Kuangren!The weakest among them were of Paradise Realm levels.Even the old man who invited them in also had a ruthless look in his eyes, he held up his hands and charged forth towards Chu Kuangren\u2019s head!\u201cHmph.\u201dA soft hum was let out with an eruption of Supreme poise!The Daoist cultivators who rushed towards Chu Kuangren instantly got obliterated into specks of bloody mist. From the void, the Seventh Forefather slowly stepped out.A horrifying surge of Supreme poise unscrupulously spread in all directions!\u201cAa Supreme one!\u201d\u201cHis protector is a Supreme one!\u201dThe entire city hall was shrouded with the Supreme poise. Countless Daoist cultivators cowered in fear, they shivered and trembled while looking at the Seventh Forefather.For Chu Kuangren, that was the first time he saw the Seventh Forefather in the flesh.Although he was old, had a decrepit stature, and looked weak, the terrifying power of his Supreme poise was still enough to strike everyone with a chilling fear.Chu Kuangren subconsciously went through the Seventh Forefather\u2019s information with his Eye of Revelation. The look of his face changed upon seeing it.Heavenly being, Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five, life essence depleting!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 39": "Chapter 39: The White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman Appears, The Seventh Forefather RevitalizesHeavenly Deterioration Stage Five!Chu Kuangren, having heard of it before, knew that that was when a cultivator reached their limit in their cultivation. Unable to progress further, it was a stage where their lives started to gradually approach its end.Even Honorable Supremes and Unmatched Great Sages were extremely afraid of reaching Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five. However, the Seventh Forefather was currently at Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five!The moment he brought forth a great surge of spiritual power, the strain on his body would accelerate his gradual dying process.Chu Kuangren felt anxious inside, but did not let any emotions show and said gently, \u201cI shall remember everything that you people did to me in City Hall today.\u201d\u201cSenior elder, we\u2019re leaving this place.\u201dChu Kuangren stood up and prepared to leave.\u201cBoy, aren\u2019t you going to kill everyone in this lousy crowd?\u201dThe Seventh Forefather had a chilling tone filled with killing intent.His Supreme domineering aura emanated through the air, and not a single person dared make any bold moves.Within Chu Kuangren\u2019s mind, he rolled his eyes in disbelief.\u2018Give me a break, old man.\u2018Do you not know the condition your body is in right now?\u2018Killing these small fries might not be a problem for you, but have you forgot that Ye Wuhen, the Honorable Supreme Swordsman is still hiding somewhere in City Hall?\u2018If he were to make a move, how long could your frail old body last?\u2019All those thoughts occurred in Chu Kuangren\u2019s mind, but he did not show any signs of worry and said, \u201cThe White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman is as well known as my Honorable Teacher. I shall stay my hand for his sake so that when the time comes, he will be able to personally explain everything to my Honorable Teacher.\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect, your kind-heartedness and considerations are admirable indeed.\u201dAt that point, a soft voice came out through the void.What followed after was an overwhelmingly terrifying burst of Daoist rhymes, which covered the entire area of the City Hall. It also surpassed and suppressed the Seventh Forefather\u2019s Daoist rhymes.A middle-aged man in white robes slowly stepped forward into mid-air.\u201cSpeak of the devil, and he will appear.\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s expression turned into an imposing and stern look.\u201cFather!\u201d\u201cMy Lord!\u201dEveryone in the crowd was in joy and their hearts swelled with confidence. That was because the person who appeared was White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman Ye Wuhen, the undefeated legend of White Cloud City.\u201cHaha, activate the Endless Horizon Forcefield Spell\u201dAt that moment, Ye Wuhen gave a command.Several pillars of light appeared around City Hall. Multiple lines and patterns of runes intertwined in the void, forming a large veil of light.Chu Kuangren and his companions instantly lost contact with the outer world.\u201cChu Kuangren, do you really think we didn\u2019t make any preparations? This Endless Horizon Forcefield Spell is so strong that even Supremes can\u2019t break through. Now you and your protector have nowhere to run!\u201dYe Baifeng laughed.Chu Kuangren ignored him, looked towards Ye Wuhen and gently chuckled. \u201cWord says that the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman was in isolation for sixty years and never came out. It\u2019s an honor that you are willing to appear just for a youngling like me, a great honor indeed.\u201cSo, are you going to go after the Primordial Purple Haze as well?\u201dThe White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman did not deny it. \u201cI have been stuck in the Supreme Honorable realm for close to two thousand years. If I were to not surpass this limit and ascend, I\u2019m afraid I\u2019ll end up like that protector of yours, entering Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five on a path to certain demise.\u201dHe was an Honorable Supreme, and despite not using the Eye of Revelation he was able to ascertain that the mighty Seventh Forefather was entering Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five.Whether it was his hopes of entering the Sage Realm or the fears he had of entering Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five, all these factors came together to propel the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman to set his eyes on the Primordial Purple Haze.Even if he had to offend the Black Heaven Sect, he would not give it up!Besides, if he could successfully ascend through to the Sage Manifestation Realm, then he could enable his Ye family to become a sage orthodoxy. Would he even be afraid of The Black Heaven sect at that point?\u201cIf you want to hurt the Sky-pride of my sect, then you\u2019ll have to go through me.\u201dThe Seventh Forefather took a step forward, blocking Chu Kuangren from Ye Wuhen.The unchecked power of the old Supreme erupted relentlessly, it did not bother him one bit even if that would fully exhaust his lifespan and cost him his life.\u201cYou\u2019re old and decrepit, you can\u2019t hold me back.\u201dThe White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman uttered.His tone was calm and indifferent, almost exuding an air of certainty about how everything would turn out later on.He was an Honorable Supreme, whose abilities were never doubted by anyone.\u201cWhat you will do is die a miserable death.\u201dThe spiritual power within Seventh Forefather\u2019s body burst forth and formed a horrifying storm which caused the surrounding area and void to rumble violently.A surge of Daoist rhymes started to swirl around the Seventh Forefather, seemingly taking the form of tiny densely packed blades which radiated with fearsome sharpness!Following that, a levitating long sword appeared before the Seventh Forefather.Chu Kuangren recognized that blade.That was the blade which was one of the Sacred Swords from the Black Heaven Sword Mountain, known as the Azure Vine.Unexpectedly, when the Seventh Forefather descended into the world, he took this sacred blade along with him.The waves of domineering supreme aura were like a violent tide crashing into the void, it was so devastating that the witnessing cultivators were shocked and could only cower in fear!The supreme one might be old, but his spirit was unwavering.\u201cThat blade you have right there, I recognize it. Yes, three thousand years ago, the seventh-generation master of the Black Heaven Sect used this blade to move unhindered and unchallenged within the Azure Dragon domain!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re Xuan Feng, the seventh-generation master of the Black Heaven Sect.\u201dThe White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cWell well, I commend you for recognizing me.\u201d The Seventh Forefather gently replied.\u201cIt\u2019s a shame that you\u2019ve reached Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five. If only I could battle you in your prime, that would be my greatest delight!\u201dThe White Cloud Honorable Swordsman had an expression of regret on his face.However, Chu Kuangren who was listening to this sneered. \u201cPretty words for a master swordsman like you. You wouldn\u2019t bother hesitating to steal from younger and junior cultivators. You\u2019re nothing but a coward who\u2019s afraid that his own strength is too weak to break through and attain power!\u201cKnowing that you\u2019re on the same level of skill and fame as my Honorable Teacher is an insult to him!\u201dThe look on the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman\u2019s face turned grim and anger began to gather within him.\u201cYou\u2019re nothing but a young cultivator, what could you possibly understand!\u201cDo you know the feeling when a cultivator reaches the end of a realm and is frozen behind a wall, unable to break through? A state where they can only continually waste their time and life away?\u201cNot everybody is privileged to obtain a Supreme Daoist Physique like you! Many people are simply mediocre in this world, if they don\u2019t take extreme measures like I am, how could they possibly hope to go far on the path of cultivation? To reach and witness the supreme path?\u201dThe White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman\u2019s tone showed his agitation, and also a bit of frustration.Chu Kuangren could not help but applaud. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever heard of someone speaking of killing and stealing other people\u2019s items in such a nice way. You definitely deserve to be a Supreme to be able to say those words.\u201cAdmirable, splendid.\u201dWhile speaking, Chu Kuangren subtly went closer to the Seventh Forefather.The White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman did not suspect anything at first and did not heed the words that Chu Kuangren spoke even though they were filled with judgment and criticism. However, he noticed something strange after that.He saw Chu Kuangren taking out a jade-like pill, which had a golden swirling light within it, and handed it to the Seventh Forefather, letting him consume it.\u201cNot good!\u201d The White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman\u2019s expression changed.He hastily let out an attack and a beam of sword light rushed forth.In the face of this supreme and domineering aura, the Chu Kuangren the greenhorn Sky-pride seemed insignificant.During this time, the Seventh Forefather stood in front of Chu Kuangren. The Azure Vine in his hand pierced forth, and a menacing surge of purple sword qi was released!The two conflicting sword lights met and clashed and two completely different types of Daoist rhymes entangled and intertwined in a chaotic exchange. It shook the void violently, threatening to collapse it altogether.That terrifying clash forced Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu to have no choice but to step back.While in mid-air, the Seventh Forefather was surrounded by swirls of brilliant light. his once majestic vitality restored. It could be seen that his dry and chapped skin became taut, his white hair had fallen off, and in its place was lush black hair that grew out.It was like a dead tree from winter which regained life when spring came!Besides that, the domineering aura from the Seventh Forefather started to grow stronger and stronger!Everyone who witnessed this was in disbelief.Someone who had reached Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five, an old man whose days were numbered had unexpectedly became rejuvenated with youth and renewed vigor, what in the world was going on!Some people from the crowd noticed what Chu Kuangren did.\u201cWhat did you give him!?\u201d Someone asked.Chu Kuangren calmly replied. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just a Life Extension Pill.\u201dIt was then that he actually recalled something that he obtained from the daily 10 consecutive lucky draws, which was a Starlight grade Life Extension Pill.He had kept that pill, despite knowing that it was useless to him.At the present time, however, there would be no better use for it than to give it to the Seventh Forefather.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 40": "Chapter 40: The Ashura\u2019s Way, Slicing Fruits and Vegetables, Already Too WeakLevitating in mid-air, the Seventh Forefather\u2019s Daoist Rhymes was spiraling around him. The vigorous spiritual power continuously spread everywhere and his menacing Honorable Supreme poise rocked the City Hall!The Seventh Forefather was supposedly someone old and weak, even reaching Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five, but he had unexpectedly returned to his peak condition! Everyone was deeply appalled by the sight of him.Just a measly Life Extension Pill was able to have that kind of effect?The people in the crowd could not help but wonder.Items like the Life Extension Pill were not that uncommon, but they have not heard of a Life Extension Pill that was able to greatly affect a Supreme one!Let alone let a Supreme one return to his prime!\u201cHaha, it\u2019s been a long time since I\u2019ve felt like this.\u201d The Seventh Forefather let out a great laugh. He was not the old elderly person from before, his hair was now as black as coal and eyes as bright as the burning sun. He had the look of a middle-aged man in his forties.He looked at the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman and said, \u201cDidn\u2019t you say you wished to fight me in my prime? Now is the time!\u201dThe White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman\u2019s face was extremely grim.He never expected Chu Kuangren to have such a terrifyingly powerful Life Extension Pill, which enabled the Seventh Forefather to return to his youthful prime.He was unsure whether he could defeat the Seventh Forefather in his prime condition.\u201cCome!\u201d The Seventh Forefather started to strike.With a slash from the Azure Vine sword, a mighty ray of purple sword light engulfed with an incomparably domineering Supreme Daoist Rhyme headed towards the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman.The battle between the two Supreme Honorable Swordsman was a terrifying one.The void was constantly shaking and vibrating, and finally shattered. The might of the Supreme domineering aura overpowered the space around them, and violently clashed and impact against the Endless Horizon Forcefield Spell.\u201cElder brother, what should we do now!?\u201dThe crowd looked towards Ye Baifeng.While Ye Baifeng himself kept staring at Chu Kuangren, his expression was ever-changing from time to time.However, Chu Kuangren playfully looked at the others, without even the slight hint that he was surrounded and in a life-threatening situation.\u201cThink clearly before you make a move on me. Everyone here will end up dead when the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman falls.\u201cOn the contrary, if the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman wins, then it\u2019s still not too late to deal with me then. Let\u2019s properly witness and enjoy this battle. Not every cultivator will have a chance to see this in their lives.\u201dSince this is a fight between Honorable Supremes, Chu Kuangren chuckled, his face having the honest expression of suggesting the others.There were quite a few that found that his words made sense.However, Ye Baifeng\u2019s eyes had a ruthless look, \u201cYou all think I\u2019m a fool? Even if we can\u2019t lay a finger on you, even if you guys win, you\u2019ll never let us go that easily. Why shouldn\u2019t we deal with you now!\u201d\u201cWell, well, well. Looks like this one\u2019s the smartest tool in the drawer.\u201d Chu Kuangren was seemingly shocked.\u201cYou! G*d d*mn it! Let\u2019s see how long you can keep up this madness!\u201dYe Baifeng was pissed and signaled the others beside him to attack.A group of Daoist cultivators immediately let out their spiritual poise towards Chu Kuangren in an attack.Among the cultivators, the weakest ones already had fully attained Golden Core realm cultivation levels, there were also a few Nascent Soul realm Daoists as well as some Paradise realm Daoists.For all of these men who attacked at the same time, their cumulated poise was a very powerful one.All of them believed that it was enough to take down Chu Kuangren.Even if he was a Sky-pride, no matter how anyone looked at it, the opponent was just a fledgling greenhorn. Without his protector by his side, there was no need to fear him!What happened after that made Ye Baifeng realize that he was mistaken.A horrifying sword wave of sword qi could be seen radiating out from Chu Kuangren\u2019s body, swirling up like a raging typhoon sweeping in all directions!The sword qi gathered, intertwined, and formed into twelve long pillars, sealing up the area around them!The Sword of the Heavens and the Thirty Sixth-Tier Green Lotus Sword Qi appeared right after!All three Daoist Physique Transformations were activated!The Sacred Sword, Descendant Self, was already held in his hands!\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique!\u201d Chu Kuangren released an attack from the sword and a burst of Daoist Rhymes rushed forth alongside a horrifying beam of purple sword light!All of the attacking Daoists were enveloped in the attack!In the next moment.The sword light went past them and through their bodies!Poof, poof, poof \u2026Specks of blood mist erupted from the air instantly!No matter if they were Golden Jade, Nascent Soul, or Paradise level Daoists, it all did not matter under that ray of sword light, as they all become souls of the dead collected by that sword!\u201cHow could this be!\u201dYe Baifeng squinted his eyes with an expression of fear and disbelief.At the back part of the crowd, Ye Lei, who personally witnessed that swing of the sword was paralyzed with fear. His face was pale white as his body shivered and cowered to the ground.\u201cImpossible, impossible.\u201cHow could he be so strong \u2026\u201dIf his opponents\u2019 spiritual foundation was far higher than him, he could console himself by explaining that spiritual power was not everything and was not even a true measure of strength.However, right now.Chu Kuangren shattered all his delusions and beliefs in chance or luck.Even when it came to combat power, Chu Kuangren\u2019s was worlds above him!All it took was a single slash to reduce everything to send pieces of flesh and blood flying everywhere.Chu Kuangren, who wielded the Descendant Self sword with his three activated Daoist Physiques had such a glorious and majestic look that he was almost ethereal, like an immortal sword deity.Anyone who witnessed Chu Kuangren would think that he was someone who belonged in the Heavens among the clouds, not that dark deity who was stained in red dust, and obviously not someone who would be standing among all the bloodshed and broken limbs scattered over the battlefield.Besides that in reality, all these broken limbs were the personal work of the dark deity himself. The guy had the face of a dark deity, and had the actions of an Ashura!\u201cAttack! Attack!\u201dYe Baifeng howled.One by one the Daoist cultivators dashed towards Chu Kuangren on a murderous spree.However, Chu Kuangren wielded the Descendant Self sword. Every slash he performed was devastating and precise, unavoidable by his opponents!The bodies started to pile up and soon after began to fill up the main hall.The surrounding buildings had already been leveled due to the ensuing battle. The gorgeous City Hall had started to look like ruins after a battle.\u201cWhy does he have such terrifying battle strength!?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s just at a Nascent Soul cultivator, why did it turn out like this. How can there be a Nascent Soul Daoist like this in this world!\u201d\u201cEven the Supreme Daoist Physique alone is too strong to deal with.\u201dThe crowd looked at Chu Kuangren with shock and fear.Many of them started to grow afraid of him.Afraid of that horrifying, peerless, one-stroke Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique.Afraid of that seemingly majestic deity-like look, which had the actions and temperament of an Ashura!High up in the air, the Seventh Forefather was dueling with the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman, and when he sensed that Chu Kuangren was slaughtering everyone down below, he breathed a sigh of relief.\u201cDo you see this, White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman? This is the peerless Sky-pride of my Black Heaven Sect! He\u2019s not one that your small fries can easily deal with!\u201dThe Seventh Forefather laughed.The White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman was shocked.He knew that Chu Kuangren has a Supreme Daoist Physique, but never did he expect that he was this strong!Chu Kuangren was just at the Nascent Soul Realm, yet being able to kill opponents who were not just at the same Nascent Soul Realm, opponents one level higher in the Paradise Realm was just too terrifying.\u201cHey hey hey, are you guys all for real here? With the strength you all have, I would think that I\u2019m slicing vegetables and fruits for a meal if I had not noticed you know.\u201d Chu Kuangren replied to Ye Baifeng and the others jokingly with contempt.Right behind him, Lan Yu, who had gorgeous silver armor and wielded the scepter of light easily took down a Nascent Soul Daoist.Upon hearing Chu Kuangren\u2019s words, she chimed in and said, \u201cWell spoken, master. I can\u2019t believe they were led by a Supreme one, everyone is so weak.\u201dListening to the both of them criticizing theri men so casually, Ye Baifeng and his two brothers were so gripped with anger that their chests were puffed up and their eyes were bloodshot red, staring daggers at both of them.However, even the brothers would have to admit.The battle strength of these two people were just too horrifying.Besides, Chu Kuangren\u2019s power was out of their expectation, but he had the Supreme Daoist Physique, and rumors had spread that he also reached the peakof three great Supreme Foundation Levels.Then again, what was up with that lady over there?Possessing vast amounts of Daoist Rhymes, paired with unbeatable fighting prowess while also wielding the scepter which was also a sacred weapon, the two of them fit each other perfectly in battle.Why had they not heard of her before?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 41": "Chapter 41: Battle Monarch\u2019s Domain, Three Great Battle Monarch Suppressed, Another Honorable Appears\u201cKill them!\u201dYe Baifeng struck out.His Battle Monarch poise erupted, two levels higher than Chu Kuangren\u2019s cultivation realm. His opponent went at Lan Yu by launching a hard slash full of power.Chu Kuangren squinted his eyes.He took a step forward and stood in front of Lan Yu and performed an attack using the Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique, the incredibly powerful Sage Ruler Technique.The clash between the two sword light beams exploded into a loud boom and set off waves upon waves of turbulence in the air, which spread out like a tide heading for the shores.\u201cHow is he able to block that attack from my blade?!\u201d Ye Baifeng was shocked to his core, the strength of a Battle Monarch was blocked by a mere Nascent Soul cultivator?At that time, another figure joined the battle.It was Ye Baifeng\u2019s younger brother, the second elder of the Ye family.\u201cLet\u2019s see how you can block this!\u201dThe Ye family\u2019s second elder smirked cunningly. He had waited for the opportunity when Chu Kuangren was blocking Ye Baifeng\u2019s attack and used his Battle Monarch cultivation base to launch a sneak attack on him!If word of this spread, it would be enough to disgrace both of them greatly.Needing two Battle Monarch cultivators to defeat a mere Nascent Soul cultivator, and even needing to resort to shameful acts like a sneak attack, who were they kidding?\u201cI was already waiting to deal with you earlier on.\u201d Chu Kuangren had a cold look on his face and formed a seal using his left arm. Large amounts of Earth Qi instantly emerge right after.That was another Sage Ruler technique, the Human Mountain Stamp!Boom!A large sacred mountain appeared out of thin air and was hurled towards the Ye Family\u2019s second elder.\u201cWhat?!\u201d The Ye family\u2019s second elder\u2019s expression changed. He held up both his arms to block the sacred mountain and took the full brunt of the terrifying Daoist Rhyme that released vast amounts of power violently at him. His body could not take it and was flung away.That scene shocked the onlookers even more.Even two Battle Monarchs could not deal with Chu Kuangren?How strong was this guy\u2019s combat power?The older cultivators, while shocked, were amazed. However, the younger, less experienced cultivators had already been dumbfounded by that display of power. Everyone was of a similar age, so why was the pair so terrifyingly strong?\u201cThis Daoist Rhyme, another Sage Ruler Technique!\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never heard of Sage Ruler Techniques existing within the Black Heaven Sect, that kind of technique is rare even on the Firmament Star itself. How can he possess so many!\u201dYe Baifeng was completely puzzled.Then again, he had already stopped bothering with specifics at that point.\u201cSecond brother, third brother, let\u2019s attack together!\u201dYe Baifeng roared in command.The momentum of the three Battle Monarchs was released simultaneously and locked onto Chu Kuangren. Three completely different types of Daoist Rhymes swirled and filled into the void.\u201cThree Battle Monarchs joining forces to defeat a younger cultivator, you guys really don\u2019t care about saving face, huh.\u201d Chu Kuangren sneered.\u201cThose who achieve greatness need not care about trivial matters like this! After killing you and obtaining the Primordial Purple Haze, and having a sage in my Ye family later on, who would even bother to remember things like this?\u201dYe Baifeng replied with a cold tone.\u201cTry me!\u201d Chu Kuangren casually replied.At that moment, the spiritual power from his body amassed to its limit.The surface of his skin started to slowly become crystal clear and shiny.\u201cThis is the Golden Jade Body!\u201dYe Baifeng exclaimed, recognizing this top-tier Daoist Physique.\u201cDon\u2019t tell me you possess the Golden Jade Body too!\u201d\u201cSupreme foundation level, Golden Jade Body, and also Sage Ruler Technique, no wonder your spiritual power can reach such a terrifying level.\u201dTheir looks started to turn serious.They had no choice but to admit that at this moment, even if the three Battle Monarchs joined forces, they would have to give it their all to defeat Chu Kuangren.\u201cBattle Monarch\u2019s Domain!\u201dYe Baifeng replied softly.Suddenly, Daoist Rhymes started to gather around Chu Kuangren\u2019s body and surrounded him, forming into a formless energy field boundary, enveloping him within it.He could feel that within this boundary field, his spiritual power was being suppressed.\u201cOh I see. So this is the Domain technique that only Battle Monarchs can utilize?\u201d Chu Kuangren was slightly surprised.Following that, the Second Elder and Third Elder also activated their own Domain techniques.The Domain of three Battle Monarchs accurately locked onto Chu Kuangren!Under multiple layers of suppression, they finally managed to suppress Chu Kuangren\u2019s spiritual power, making him weaker by thirty percent!However, the three of them were still shocked and anxious.The Battle Monarch\u2019s Domain was only a technique that Battle Monarch cultivators could utilize, the moment it was activated, even if the cultivator was at a Paradise Realm level should be rendered immobile.However, with the three of them Battle Monarch cultivators joining forces, they could only reduce Chu Kuangren\u2019s spiritual power by thirty percent. That guy was too terrifying!\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique!\u201d Upon knowing his spiritual power was being suppressed, Chu Kuangren went on the offensive. Horrifying beams of sword light burst forth.\u201cHeavenly Sky Sword Technique!\u201d\u201cStacking Tide Blade Technique \u2013 Final Form!\u201d\u201cHeavenly Sky Sword Technique!\u201dYe Baifeng and his brothers also immediately let out their supreme techniques!Although they were not as strong as the Sage Ruler Technique that Chu Kuangren performed, the combined forces of the trio managed to block that attack because their cultivation levels were greatly higher than Chu Kuangren, on top of the fact they were in the Battle Monarch Realm,Upon the impact from the sword\u2019s light, the surrounding area was violently shaken and rumbled. The city hall, which had already been damaged leaving only a few remaining intact structures, was instantly turned into ruins.The onlooking crowd did not dare get too close.That battle could only be safely witnessed by Paradise Realm cultivators at that point.With horrifying swirls of Daoist Rhymes, vast bursts of sword light plus the Battle Monarch\u2019s Domain which would immobilize any Paradise Realm cultivators, they would only be in their way if they tried to help.Humm!At this point, something rippled through the void.A silver-white spear emanating with vast surges of Daoist Rhymes shot through the air like a meteor in the skies, heading towards the Ye family\u2019s Third Master!\u201cNot good!\u201d The Ye family\u2019s Third Master had his hair stood on its end, he hurriedly turned and conjured more spiritual power and held up his palm against that spear without a second thought.A loud boom crackled when the spear impacted with a ferocious crack. Horrifying shockwaves caused by the attack engulfed the right arm of the Ye family\u2019s Third Master and blew it up into a bloody mist on the spot. A screaming pain could be heard right after as the Ye family\u2019s Third Master was hurled away by the attack.\u201cThird brother!\u201d Ye Baifeng\u2019s eyes turned red as he saw what happened.\u201cG*d d*mn it!\u201dThe Ye family\u2019s Second Master looked towards Lan Yu, donned in silver armor while flapping her wings. That thrust of the spear was an attack from her.\u201cAwesome shot Lan Yu!\u201d Chu Kuangren laughed.Since the Ye family\u2019s Third Master was heavily injured, his Battle Monarch\u2019s Domain subsided, which decreased how much Chu Kuangren was suppressed, increasing his battle strength!Hearing that praise, Lan Yu smiled and proceeded to gather more spiritual power around the white spear. Lines of runes and texts swirled around the spear, and the surges of horrifying Daoist Rhymes were enough to make anyone cower in fear.That was her strongest move, the Judgement of Light!Ordinarily, with her current strength, she could only use that move twice. However, the sacred scepter of light greatly increased how many times she could launch that attack. According to her rough estimation, she could use that attack at least seven more times.\u201cG*d d*mn it! What\u2019s going on with these two!\u201d\u201cHow could their combat strength be this terrifyingly strong!\u201dEveryone in the city hall was dumbfounded.Normally, two Nascent Soul cultivators going toe-to-toe with three Battle Monarch cultivators should be an incredible sight, what more two Nascent Soul cultivators actually suppressing back three Battle Monarch cultivators!What Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu were doing at that moment was courageously challenging the psychological endurance of the onlooking crowd.The audience felt as if their world view had been shattered and refreshed before them.Just when Lan Yu was about to charge for another attack with the spear, right before she was about to attack, a sudden burst of Daoist Rhymes burst forth. Following that, a wave of spiritual power in the form of a palm shot towards and landed on Lan Yu.The spear was shattered in an instant, and Lan Yu was flung out of battle, with stains of blood on her feathers which fell off.Chu Kuangren\u2019s expression changed drastically. \u201cLan Yu!\u201dAt that point, Lan Yu, who was attacked in mid-air, fell and landed on the ground, her armor gleaming with light. Although she was heavily injured, it was not a life-threatening injury.She looked into the distance and said sternly, \u201cA supreme one!\u201d\u201cOh, that armor you have on is truly extraordinary to be able to take that palm attack of mine. I guess it must be a top-notch Supreme Weapon then.\u201dA bright and alluring voice resounded as a beautiful lady in a red dress stepped into the area in mid-air.That woman\u2019s body surged with a monstrous amount of Daoist Rhymes, although it was far inferior to an Honorable Supreme, her existence was definitely at the level of an Honorable Realm cultivator.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 42": "Chapter 42: Another Use for the Primordial Purple Haze, Mad Levelling\u201cMother!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Mother, she\u2019s come out of meditation as well.\u201dYe Baifeng and his two brothers had a delighted look on their faces.In the midst of that, Chu Kuangren rushed to Lan Yu instead. He moved in front of her to protect her, while also glaring at the beautiful lady. Multiple lines of great runes swirled within his eyes.\u201cLi Ruolan, wife of the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman; cultivation level, Honorable Realm \u2013 final stage; cultivated a supreme technique, the Red Lotus Flame Technique\u2026\u201dThe information obtained from the Eye of Revelation made Chu Kuangren concerned.Everyone in the whole world only knew of the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman in White Cloud City.However, not many knew that the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman\u2019s spouse was secretly also an Honorable Realm cultivator, being at the final stage as well.She was just one step away from being a Supreme one.Li Ruolan looked at the Ye family\u2019s Third Master, her expression turned cold and grim. \u201cHow dare you hurt my son, you all shall die here!\u201dThe Honorable Realm cultivator\u2019s poise was mighty and turbulent, heading towards Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu.Chu Kuangren mustered all his spiritual power and gathered them to their limits.His three Daoist Physique transformations activated!They barely held back the poise of the Honorable Realm cultivator!\u201cThat\u2019s just the sheer might of her poise, if she starts attacking it\u2019ll be hundreds or thousand times stronger! Honorable realm cultivators are no joke.\u201dChu Kuangren spoke to himself.During that time, the Seventh Forefather was fighting the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman in a ferocious battle.Upon seeing Chu Kuangren in trouble, his eyes turned red from anger, and he started to frantically swing his Azure Vine, trying to break away from the fight with White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman.However, the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman was a troublesome one, and would not allow him to break away easily.\u201cSeventh Forefather of the Black Heaven Sect, once my wife is done with Chu Kuangren we\u2019ll join forces against you together. Let\u2019s send you to the afterlife to serve as his protector as well!\u201d\u201cHaha, how can you possibly fight against me once I obtain the Primordial Purple Haze and ascend to sagehood? Who cares even if your Black Heaven Sect is a sage orthodoxy?\u201dThe White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman laughed loudly, beaming with delight and confidence.Under his provocation, the Seventh Forefather started to get distracted.However, just when the situation was progressing in favor of the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman and his side, Chu Kuangren suddenly did something.He slowly opened the palm of his hand. A purple-colored gas could be seen fuming from his palm, flowing with mysterious and beautiful Daoist Rhymes, which sounded and echoed majestically through the air.\u201cAren\u2019t you looking for this, the Primordial Purple Haze?\u201dChu Kuangren gently smiled.Everyone stopped whatever they were doing as they stared at the Primordial Purple Haze in awe. Their eyes filled with passion and longing for that item.That item was a type of Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate!Even the Honorable Supremes would scramble in madness, eager to get an item like this!Now, that opportunity to do so laid before their very eyes.No one knew what Chu Kuangren\u2019s intention was for casually showing the Primordial Purple Haze, but it did not faze them in any way.\u201cYes, hand it over this instant!\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren, hand it over now, we\u2019ll spare your life if you do so.\u201dYe Baifeng and the others hurriedly said.\u201cThe Primordial Purple Haze, a type of Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate. But did you all know that it can be used in another way as well?\u201d Chu Kuangren casually grinned.Li Ruolan, who could not help herself but be intoxicated and dazzled by the sight of the Primordial Purple Haze, regained her focus.\u201cNot good!\u201d Upon hearing what Chu Kuangren said, Li Ruolan\u2019s expression changed, and following that her terrifying Daoist Rhymes erupted and blasted out towards him in the form of a palm.The Daoist Rhymes intertwined between the palm of her hands, forming into a beautiful red lotus.However, what laid within it was horrifying surges of an Honorable cultivator\u2019s poise.It could even obliterate the strongest cultivators within the Battle Monarch level instantly!However, it was too late.Chu Kuangren\u2019s palm clumped into a fist, crushing the purple gas within it. A sudden burst of overflowing Daoist Rhymes exploded endlessly. Violent surges of spiritual power started to surround and swirl around his body like a great whirlwind!The palm-shaped qi met and crashed against the whirlwind, and was instantly dispersed.Within the smoke and dust that the impact kicked up, it was impossible to tell what condition Chu Kuangren\u2019s was in, but everyone could feel a strong and terrifying build-up of Daoist Rhymes rising.\u201cWhat\u2019s happening?!\u201d\u201cThis vast surge of Daoist Rhymes, what did he do!\u201dWhen the dust and smoke dissipated, Chu Kuangren appeared. At that moment, his body was surrounded by swirls of mysterious lights. Ridiculously powerful surges of Daoist Rhymes circulated around his body. His cultivation level was rising drastically.Nascent Soul Realm, Paradise Realm, Battle Monarch Realm\u2026\u201cWhat have you done?!\u201d The White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman yelled from mid-air, the veins on his forehead popping out and his bloodshot eyes filled with anger.Obviously, that Honorable Supreme was extremely enraged, seething with unprecedented anger!Mixed in with that anger was also bouts of sorrow!Not just him, as well.Li Ruolan, Ye Baifeng, and the others were also staring at Chu Kuangren with rage as if he did something unforgivable.\u201cTo think he used the Primordial Purple Haze to force his cultivation level to rise temporarily as he absorbed it!\u201d The Seventh Forefather could not help but feel a sense of regret in Chu Kuangren\u2019s actions.Everyone in the crowd knew that the Primordial Purple Haze was a type of Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate. As long as one properly took the time to digest and absorb it, they could already reach the Sage Manifestation Realm by bypassing the Ascension Realm.Besides that, however, the Primordial Purple Haze also had another use, which was to drastically increase one\u2019s cultivation level for a short amount of time.However, compared to the first use case, the second one was incomparably insignificant. No person in their right mind would use it for the latter purpose.It would be too much of a waste for such a priceless item.Compared to attaining sagehood, what worth would it have increasing one\u2019s cultivation level for a short amount of time?As time went on, everyone seemingly forgot that other function of the Primordial Purple Haze. They were now reminded of it from Chu Kuangren\u2019s actions.Which was using that very item in front of them in such a manner!\u201cB*st*rd, that b*st*rd!\u201d\u201cThat item is an Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate. If properly used can enable one to become a sage. Yet for the sake of pursuing a short term benefit, he impulsively used it to forcefully raise his cultivation levels, and that rise will only last temporarily as well.\u201d\u201cWhat a waste of such a precious item!\u201dEveryone in the crowd was angry and their reddened eyes filled with rage. They could do nothing but curse at him.The Entwined Sage\u2019s Fate was used up just like that in front of their eyes, it had created an unprecedented impact on all their Daoist hearts!However, Chu Kuangren was not bothered by everyone\u2019s reactions.He was now immersed in the wealth of enlightenment brought upon by the Primordial Purple Haze and only felt the Daoist sounds reverberating in his ears. Countless feelings and a sense of mystery emerged.Not only that, the spiritual power within his body shot up exponentially with the help of the Primordial Purple Haze, and reached the peak of the Battle Monarch cultivation level!His three Supreme Daoist Physique Transformations were also strengthened immeasurably.\u201cD*mn you, I\u2019ll turn you into a pile of ashes!\u201dThe Primordial Purple Haze was destroyed just like that, the look on Li Ruolan\u2019s face was extremely bitter.In a fit of rage, she conjured up her spiritual power and unleashed violent surges of Daoist Rhymes, forming into a red lotus who was entwined in bright red flames.That attack was filled with the might and poise of an Honorable one!Chu Kuangren held his Descendent Self sword and swung it.The Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique was released!The terrifying sword light that was leaps and bounds more powerful than before bathed everything around it in light, while that red lotus seemed petite and tiny compared to the sheer might of that sword-light beam.In the blink of an eye, the red lotus was shattered!Li Ruolan was hit by the sword attack and was flung away!\u201cHow can this be?!\u201dYe Baifeng and the others stared in disbelief and shock.Even with the use of the Primordial Purple Haze, Chu Kuangren\u2019s cultivation level only increased to the peak of the Battle Monarch Realm. How could that one attack from him send Li Ruolan flying?A Battle Monarch\u2019s and Honorable One\u2019s power difference was like night and day.\u201cOh, how the tables have turned.\u201d Chu Kuangren chuckled while looking at Li Ruolan.Before this, he felt that the might and poise of the Honorable Ones were very tremendous and limitless.However, right now, that was not the case anymore.\u201cBut I feel that I can become stronger!\u201d Chu Kuangren grinned. The lingering effect of the Primordial Purple Haze had not yet dissipated completely!It was Li Ruolan now who was frightened. Her face turned pale upon hearing that.Being able to push her back and also hurt her with a single sword attack, if he got stronger, would that not mean he could easily crush her then?\u201cNot good, he\u2019s reaching and breaking through to the Honorable Realm!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43: Domineering Aura Surrounds White Cloud City, Killing The Honorable, The Sky Rains In RedThe Primordial Purple Haze pumped copious amounts of energy into every vessel of Chu Kuangren\u2019s body.Chu Kuangren felt that with his current state, he could easily shatter the heavens and earth and dominate all realms. It was an addictive sensation.It was also at that instance that his cultivation had gone up another level!His cultivation base had ascended into the Honorable Realm!Having embodied the Supreme Daoist Physique, reached the peak of three Supreme Foundation Levels, and being well-versed in both Sage Techniques and Sage Ruler Techniques, Chu Kuangren would make an incredibly powerful Honorable Realm cultivator!As he ascended into that realm, he released a domineering aura that could rival that of a Supreme Honorable. Like waves of a tsunami, the aura came crashing into every element of this realm.The Endless Horizon Forcefield Spell could not withstand the pressure of his domineering aura and began to crack. With a loud bang, the entire forcefield was completely shattered into smithereens!The vast streams of domineering aura overcame the barrier and traveled in all directions.The entire White Cloud City was shocked by its presence!Every cultivator, including some Honorable Realm cultivators, immediately froze as they averted their gaze towards the city hall.\u201cI can feel that domineering aura, what kind of Daoist Rhymes are these?!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think even a Supreme Honorable is capable of such a feat!\u201d\u201cCould it be that Honorable Swordsman White Cloud is making his move?\u201d\u201cNo, that\u2019s not right. These Daoist Rhymes don\u2019t belong to Honorable Swordsman White Cloud. They\u2019re foreign. I wonder which genius has descended upon this city?\u201d\u201cMy God, this domineering aura is too frightening to handle.\u201dEvery cultivator was mortified by its presence.Most cultivators below the Nascent Soul Realm could not withstand the might of the aura and immediately collapsed and trembled on the ground, while the rest could still at least stand. It was only the cultivators in the Paradise Realm or above who could resume their activities.Some cultivators were even displeased at the situation, thinking that whoever released that aura was probably too boastful.Little did they know that the owner of the domineering aura had been a Nascent Soul cultivator just a few minutes ago.Chu Kuangren\u2019s domineering aura had alerted the entire city. Many skilled cultivators rushed to the city hall to find out that it had been reduced to a wasteland.\u201cDid someone attack City Hall?\u201d\u201cWho would have the guts to do so? Can it be the owner of this domineering aura?\u201d\u201cLook at that youngster\u2026 How could this be?!\u201dThose who came to the city hall immediately looked for the source of the aura once they arrived. The first thing that caught their attention was Chu Kuangren.A youngster? Being a Supreme Honorable?These people were in disbelief.Even Li Ye reacted similarly when he arrived at the scene after rushing from the White Jade Hotel.Chu Kuangren was just a Nascent Soul Realm cultivator when they met yesterday. How could he immediately ascend into becoming a Supreme Honorable today? Was it all a dream?Li Ye had felt that whatever he witnessed was all too surreal.\u201cTake the rest and leave, Baifeng!\u201dLi Ruolan instructed Ye Baifeng and the group.The domineering aura had managed to intimidate even an Honorable Realm cultivator like her, what more for the rest of the people. To not escape was definitely a death sentence for the group of people!\u201cLeave? Where do you think you\u2019re going?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked calmly. Then, the sword qi within the realm immediately exploded and formed twelve enormous sword qi pillars that were so tall, they could reach the clouds, circling and sealing the city hall within.Daoist Conjuration, the Nine Heavens Sword Prison!It was said that once the Sword Prison was erected, nothing within the Nine Heavens could escape from its confinement!\u201cI\u2019m fighting you till the death!\u201dLi Ruolan ground her teeth as fiery flames erupted from within her body, forming a huge red lotus.She had chosen to push her spiritual powers to their limit at the risk of damaging her cultivation roots, summoning a strength that surpassed even that of an Honorable Realm cultivator.The enormous red lotus spun on its own axis as it flew towards Chu Kuangren. The energy level was so mortifying that the red lotus had bent the space it existed in.\u201cIf that\u2019s your only option, then prepare to go under!\u201d Chu Kuangren said. Subsequently, the entire White Cloud City began to tremble.A substantial amount of earth qi began to flow from beneath White Cloud City, and an ancient sacred mountain that reached the height of ten thousand feet was formed in front of Chu Kuangren!The ancient mountain came crashing down on the red lotus, instantly smashing it to dust!Li Ruolan let out a loud wail as she drew her last breath!A cultivator who had almost reached the Supreme Honorable Realm was defeated just like that.\u201cRuolan!!!\u201dHonorable Swordsman White Cloud let out a heartbroken cry as he dashed towards Chu Kuangren, channeling all the might of a Supreme Honorable and unleashing it on Chu Kuangren!Upon the stroke of a sword, the blinding silver Sword Ray came crashing down upon Chu Kuangren!Very few in the Azure Dragon Domain could withstand such a stroke!\u201cI\u2019ll teach you what true swordsmanship looks like!\u201d Chu Kuangren channeled his sword qi as the Sword of the Heavens emerged above his head.Chu Kuangren now had the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart as well as a booming cultivation base. He was not afraid of defeating even a Supreme Honorable in the art of swordsmanship.While both opponents were displaying such extraordinary swordsmanship, the swords throughout the entire city were vibrating in response.Countless swords flew out of their scabbards and buried themselves halfway into the ground. The blades were bent in a manner that resembled the demeanor of a person bowing in grace!Tens of thousands of sword blades were bowing in subservience!All the swordsmen at the scene were stunned at witnessing such an incredible phenomenon.Facing the imminent strike of Honorable Swordsman White Cloud, Chu Kuangren wielded the Descendant Self Sword and similarly counterattacked with a single strike!Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique!The purple sword ray gushed out like a thunderous waterfall!The cultivators felt shivers down their spines as they witnessed the remarkable sword ray. Even Li Ye felt goosebumps all over his body!It was the purest, most terrifying form of offensive sword strategy that they had ever seen!The two sword rays collided into each other midair and their Daoist Rhymes intersected with one another, creating a terrorizing impact that shook the entire earth.Above White Cloud City, the clouds parted ways from the force and were split apart.Like a tsunami, Chu Kuangren\u2019s sword ray completely obliterated his opponent\u2019s sword ray.Honorable Swordsman White Cloud reacted in fear and attempted to block the incoming sword ray with his own sword. Yet, the force immediately crushed him downwards and sent him to the ground, forming a gigantic crater on the ground where he landed.The supposedly elegant Supreme Honorable was then seen kneeling on the ground in a pathetic state as blood frothed out his mouth.His eyes revealed a hint of remorse.If he had known better, he would not have obsessed over Chu Kuangren\u2019s Primordial Purple Haze. Maybe then, his beloved wife would not have died and the city hall would not have fallen to such a dire state.Alas, it was all gone!There was no use crying over spilled milk!\u201cMy next strike shall finish you!\u201dChu Kuang\u2019s voice resonated throughout the sky.The Daoist Rhymes were still ascending endlessly as his Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart reignited. His Golden Jade Body was also mobilized to its maximum capacity.The Descendant Self Sword was shaking violently.Above the tip of Descendent Self, a purple ray of sword light was forming, waiting to be released!Honorable Swordsman White Cloud knew he would not withstand this strike. He screamed, \u201cChu Kuangren has the Yuan Ling Treasury in his possession!\u201dEveryone was surprised at the revelation.No one would have thought that Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s Treasure was actually with Chu Kuangren the whole time!\u201cHuh, even near-death you\u2019re still unwilling to give me peace of mind. Do you think your trick would work? I would be curious to see who else would dare mess with my possessions after this!\u201d Chu Kuangren laughed and drew his sword!The ferocious sword ray instantly annihilated Honorable Swordsman White Cloud!The sword ray even swallowed the whole group of cultivators behind him.There were no painful wails of terror. Even if there were, their voices would have been buried by the explosions when the sword ray destroyed everything in its path.After a single sword strike, the White Cloud city hall was wiped out of existence!Chu Kuangren collapsed onto the ground. The effect from the Primordial Purple Haze quickly diminished upon that strike. His cultivation deteriorated too.Chu Kuangren sighed, \u201cAt the end of the day, cultivation earned through proper training still beats one that\u2019s earned through coercive means.\u201dNot far away, a few arriving warriors were stunned by what they witnessed.The legendary figure of White Cloud City had died just like that in front of their eyes . They could not help but feel that it was all too surreal.Then, red clouds started forming above, and the clouds parted to shower red rain. It was only when they were all soaking wet did the spectators return to their senses.\u201cIf a Supreme Honorable falls, the sky always rains red!\u201d\u201cHonorable Swordsman White Cloud\u2026 Is actually dead!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44: Ye Lei Begs For Mercy, Do You Want It? Chu Kuangren\u2019s Reputation Soars Once MoreChu Kuangren watched the sky release its red rain and let out a peal of light laughter. \u201cSo it\u2019s true that whenever a Supreme One falls, an anomaly will appear in the physical realm.\u201dAccording to an ancient legend, when the last Emperor Realm cultivator had fallen, the Giant Daoist Bell rang and thunderstorms fell across the entire physical realm for three days.In comparison, perhaps the red drizzle did not seem that impressive after all.The drizzle did not last long before sunlight once again pierced through the dark clouds.Chu Kuangren laid among the debris as the sun bathed him in its warm golden light. The crowd, still intimidated by his domineering aura, did not dare approach him.They were confused.How was Chu Kuangren capable of killing Honorable Swordsman White Cloud?Why did his cultivation base now seem so weak?Further, was Yuan Ling\u2019s Treasury really in his possession?So many questions, yet so little answers. Until these mysteries were solved, no one dared provoke him even if Chu Kuangren were to collapse now.\u201cLan Yu, look around and see if any of their kind managed to survive. Show no mercy and kill them all! I won\u2019t have to bother with this biting me in the back next time.\u201dChu Kuangren instructed calmly.\u201cYes, Master,\u201d Lan Yu nodded her head.It was not long before she found two members.\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me. I\u2019m begging you!\u201d Ye Lei kneeled and begged incessantly for his life. Having been buried under a pile of debris, he was covered in bloodstains and dust as his hair messily covered his shoulders.The usual glory of being the almost-genius of the Ye Family was long gone.\u201cBrother Chu, please spare my life. If you let me go, I\u2019ll do whatever you ask of me, even if it means becoming your slave,\u201d Ye Lei said.\u201cAre you Li Xingchen\u2019s friend?\u201dChu Kuangren recalled that he had met Ye Lei once during the party Li Xingchen organized.Ye Lei\u2019s eyes glimmered with hope and nodded hastily. \u201cThat\u2019s right, I\u2019m a very dear friend to Li Xingchen. Out of my friendship with him, I beg you to spare my life. I promise to repay your kindness in the future.\u201dChu Kuangren shook his head and said, \u201cI find it funny that you\u2019re still willing to repay my kindness after I\u2019ve murdered your entire family.\u201d\u201cIn a moment of greed, they\u2019ve unfortunately chosen to wrong you. I do not find their death unjustified,\u201d Ye Lei attempted to flatter Chu Kuangren.In reality, hatred had filled Ye Lei\u2019s heart to the brim and he had already pictured countless ways of how Chu Kuangren would die. If it were not for him clinging to his dear life, he would not have resorted to put on an innocent act and undermine his own parents.As long as he lived, revenge was still a possibility!\u201cNot bad, you\u2019re such a sweet talker.\u201dChu Kuangren laughed and immediately gripped tightly onto his hilt as he slashed Ye Lei. The precise sword qi instantly dislocated his brain.Even until death, Ye Lei would never find out why had all his trickery and false humilities failed to save his own life.Indeed, Chu Kuangren was not even sure whether Ye Lei was behaving genuinely. However, he was not willing to take any chance if it meant Ye Lei could one day create trouble for him, even if Ye Lei was no threat to him.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s collect some loot.\u201dChu Kuangren said.He had already used the Primordial Purple Haze in this battle, a unique possession that could allow him to ascend into sagehood. Even if Chu Kuangren had no intention of becoming a sage, it was still an invaluable item.Alas, it was now gone.It would be a waste if he did not at least attempt to retrieve some loot from the city hall.However, this battle was fierce. Most of the cultivators\u2019 corpses did not even manage to survive the impact. All that was left were some Yin and Yang rings.Some of them were even damaged and could not be used.Fortunately, a simple search around had yielded Chu Kuangren a decent amount of items.After all, a city hall that was once resided by a Supreme Honorable could not be all bad.Once he finished, Chu Kuangren then made a move to leave.At that moment, a middle-aged cultivator could no longer withhold his temptation. He halted Chu Kuangren and asked, \u201cHonorable Swordsman White Cloud said that the Yuan Ling treasures are with you. Is that true?\u201dChu Kuangren replied, \u201cYes, do you want them?\u201dThe middle-aged cultivator was immediately stunned by his reply.Of course, he did!In fact, he was completely obsessed about it.Yet, the picture of Chu Kuangren brutally murdering Honorable Swordsman White Cloud was still lingering in the minds of all that were present. They did not dare take another step forward.Chu Kuangren took a sweeping glance across the crowd and said, \u201cThe treasure is with me. If you want it, you\u2019re free to come take it. However, I don\u2019t need to remind you of Honorable Swordsman White Cloud\u2019s fate when he tried to do so.\u201d\u201cYou only managed to kill him because you artificially enhanced your strength. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll be able to pull it off another time,\u201d one of the cultivators said.They found out.At that time, Chu Kuangren\u2019s domineering aura had long been gone.\u201cYou\u2019re right, I used the Primordial Purple Haze!\u201dChu Kuangren confessed.Everyone was surprised by his answer.\u201cThe Primordial Purple Haze, it would\u2019ve been the foundation of becoming a sage!\u201d\u201cYou used a Primordial Purple Haze to enhance your cultivation base and killed Honorable Swordsman White Cloud. Such a waste to an invaluable treasure!\u201d\u201cBastard! If that thing was in my possession, I could easily become a sage within a hundred years! Why didn\u2019t you just give it to me?!\u201dThey were devastated by how Chu Kuangren had consumed that precious resource.Some sighed, the others lamented. Some even stared at Chu Kuangren with a deep-rooted hatred.For most people, the Primordial Purple Haze was a legendary resource.However, the crowd\u2019s reactions were exactly what Chu Kuangren wanted.Many warriors, powerful cultivators, and even Honorables knew clearly that Yuan Ling\u2019s treasures were capable of ascending one to sagehood and had set their sights onto it.Now that it was revealed the Yuan Ling\u2019s treasures were in Chu Kuangren\u2019s possession, revealing that the Primordial Purple Haze had been consumed would not invite further trouble. In fact, now that everyone knew the Yuan Ling treasures could no longer help with ascendency, powerful cultivators would no longer take interest in the treasures anymore and leave Chu Kuangren alone.The remaining cultivators who were still keen on the treasure would most probably not provoke Chu Kuangren as well due to his association with the Black Heaven Sect.Chu Kuangren could not help but admire his own intelligence.Even in the worst-case scenario, if a powerful cultivator was to come after his treasure, he still had the backing of Seventh Forefather.The Seventh Forefather was a Supreme Honorable at his peak!\u201cWho would have thought that Honorable Swordsman White Cloud would be blinded by a junior cultivator\u2019s possession and ended up getting killed himself?\u201d\u201cBeing an Honorable one of his generation, it\u2019s surreal where his fate had taken him.\u201dLi Ye looked at the fallen city hall and lamented.\u201cThe whole world is run by greed. Such is the law. Even noble sages could not be spared by this instinct,\u201d Chu Kuangren said.Chu Kuangren did not see the Honorable Swordsman as an entirely evil person. As the saying goes, \u2018The cost of avarice is death.\u2019 Such is the common observation in humanity.It was unfortunate that they had chosen to mess with the wrong person.There was then no more room for discussion.It did not matter if he was an Honorable One or a sage, the penalty for such a crime was death.\u201c\u2018The whole world is run by greed\u2026 Haha, Brother Chu, you are indeed thoughtful and articulate!\u201d Li Ye complimented Chu Kuangren. Even Li Ye was now keen to make acquaintance with Chu Kuangren, what more for Li Xingchen.\u201cJust thinking out loud.\u201dChu Kuangren laughed and proceeded to make his departure.This time, no one had stopped him.As they watched Chu Kuangren walk into the distance, the crowd felt as if they were watching the rise of a young Emperor!\u201cAfter this battle, Chu Kuangren\u2019s name will shock the entire kingdom!\u201d A cultivator lamented.The death of a Supreme Honorable was impossible to be kept as a secret.Naturally, the person responsible for that death would be known to everyone.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45: The Orthodoxies Quarrel, Princess Linglong Is Looking For A Companion\u201cRed rain is falling from the sky. A Supreme Honorable has fallen!\u201d\u201cWho died? And who\u2019s behind it?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only one Supreme Honorable in White Cloud City and that person\u2019s Ye Wuhen. Could it be that he\u2019s the fallen Supreme Honorable?\u201dEveryone had witnessed the red rain.Even if Chu Kuangren had wanted to, it was impossible to hide the truth.Everyone was engulfed in shock knowing that a Supreme Honorable had fallen.As Chu Kuangren walked amongst the street, he overheard all the whispers and gossips. Although indifferent on the outside, Chu Kuangren felt a sense of helplessness from within.Fame was always an ingredient for disaster.This time, he once again became the center of another controversy.He was already blessed with a handsome appearance and an unprecedented talent. Now that his reputation had soared, would other cultivators not be jealous?Chu Kuangren felt dispirited.Soon enough, he arrived at the White Jade Hotel.\u201cBrother Chu, did you know what\u2019s with that sudden surge of domineering auras a moment ago? What happened at the city hall?\u201d Li Xingchen hastily approached Chu Kuangren. He was aware that Chu Kuangren had attended a banquet there.Chu Kuangren nodded, \u201cIt\u2019s nothing big. An Honorable was killed, that\u2019s all.\u201dLi Xingchen and a group of people reacted in shock.For a moment, they doubted their own hearing. Which part of an Honorable dying was not a big issue?Hold on.Li Xingchen seemed to realize something and asked, \u201cAn Honorable was killed\u2026 Brother Chu, did you kill that Honorable?\u201dThe rest covered their mouths to conceal their laughter. They thought Li Xingchen was being ridiculous. How was Chu Kuangren capable enough to kill an Honorable?What a joke. He was just a Nascent Soul cultivator.\u201cYes.\u201dChu Kuangren did not deny that statement.The group was in disbelief. This bloke surely knew how to toot his own horn.\u201cA supreme genius indeed, no one could match that thick skin of his. He didn\u2019t even think it through before he went on with his ridiculous stories,\u201d someone muttered in the crowd.Li Xingchen laughed along and said, \u201cBrother Chu, you sure know how to tell a good joke.\u201d\u201cBy the way, Brother Li, Ye Lei is also dead. I killed him as well. I thought I should inform you first,\u201d Chu Kuangren did not mind whether everyone bought his story. He calmly passed the news to Li Xingchen.Li Xingchen\u2019s mood changed a little. He looked at Chu Kuangren for a good moment before he sighed and lamented, \u201cWhat a shame. That person was one of the most talented cultivation experts. I didn\u2019t think he would have fallen so soon.\u201dAlthough it was apparent that Li Xingchen sympathized with Ye Lei, there was no hint of sadness at all on his face.Chu Kuangren was surprised and asked, \u201cWas he not your friend?\u201d\u201cNot really. It\u2019s just that living together in White Cloud City, it was natural that we would bump into each other from time to time, but he wasn\u2019t really a close friend.\u201d\u201cI see,\u201d Chu Kuangren understood.\u201cBy the way, Brother Chu, why did you kill him?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s a long story, you may ask your father about it. I still have some matters to attend to and shall retreat to my own room to rest,\u201d Chu Kuangren said.\u2026In the guest room.Chu Kuangren retrieved some healing pills for Lan Yu and said, \u201cYou\u2019ve taken some damage in this battle. Go have a good rest.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s still some remnants of the Primordial Purple Haze residing within my body. I would like to perform Closed Door Meditation for a few days to fully digest it.\u201d\u201cMaster, do you need me to guard the doors?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s okay. Seventh Forefather is here.\u201dWith Seventh Forefather present, Chu Kuangren did not need to worry about being disrupted.Although Seventh Forefather had vanished ever since the Honorable Swordsman died, Chu Kuangren knew that he was always protecting him from the shadows.\u2026As Chu Kuangren was meditating behind closed doors, the news of his possession of Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s Treasury and his killing of Honorable Swordsman White Cloud soon spread far and wide.It was not long before White Cloud City was shocked by the news.\u201cSo Brother Chu did not lie to me after all\u2026\u201d Li Xingchen was still in disbelief after he enquired about the events from his father.At the same time, he was also confused as to how Chu Kuangren became such an excellent cultivator despite both of them belonging to the same generation.Soon enough, the news spread beyond White Cloud City and had reached across Azure Dragon Domain and even throughout Firmament Star.In the sage orthodox, Zhiyang Valley.The sky-pride of Zhiyang Valley immediately jumped out of his seat when he heard the news. He exclaimed, \u201cIs this true?\u201d\u201cAbsolutely. White Cloud City had red rain, confirming the death of Honorable Swordsman White Cloud. Whereas many cultivators had claimed that they witnessed Chu Kuangren killing Honorable Swordsman White Cloud. It\u2019s unlikely that the news is fake.\u201d\u201cHow is that possible\u2026\u201d\u201cApparently, he managed to do it using the Primordial Purple Haze. Even then, it was still an impressive feat.\u201dUpon hearing that explanation, the young man dressed in a purple robe felt a sense of relief.Regardless, no one could deny the fact that Chu Kuangren had indeed killed Honorable Swordsman White Cloud. It was something the young man could never have done.\u2026.\u201cI\u2019ve never thought that Chu Kuangren would possess such remarkable abilities. How admirable. One of these days, I must find a time and place to properly meet him.\u201dThe maiden sage of School of White Lotus said.Many cultivators had drowned in envy upon hearing her intention.The White Lotus maiden sage was an excellent sky-pride throughout the entire kingdom. Having been blessed with unprecedented beauty, she was almost angelic to many cultivators.She had never been this friendly with another man in the past.No one would have thought that she not only admired Chu Kuangren, but that she was also so eager to meet him.It was a move that shattered many men\u2019s hearts.\u2026\u201cPfft, what\u2019s there to be excited about? It\u2019s not like he defeated Honorable Swordsman White Cloud with his own ability. Chu Kuangren needed to rely on an external source of power to do so.\u201dThe third prince of the Royal Azure Dynasty said. Ever since Chu Kuangren injured his brother, he had long disliked the person. Naturally, he would try to undermine and diminish Chu Kuangren\u2019s achievements and abilities.Yet, the Black Heaven Sect was unwilling to let him have his way.\u201cIf you\u2019re so good, why don\u2019t you go challenge an Honorable One yourself?\u201d Chu Kuangren\u2019s top fan, Nangong Huang said.\u201cElder Senior Brother has a remarkable heavenly form, which allowed him to properly absorb the power of Primordial Purple Haze and defeat the Supreme Honorable One! If it was a certain prince in his position, I doubt ten Primordial Purple Haze could even do the job.\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s number two fan, Murong Xuan joined in as well.The two major sage orthodoxies had engaged in a massive quarrel.\u201cIt\u2019s an undeniable fact that Elder Senior Brother had defeated a Supreme Honorable. He\u2019s unparalleled in this world whether you like it or not.\u201d\u201cUnparalleled in this world? What a mouthful. If I didn\u2019t know better I would have thought your Elder Senior Brother is an Emperor.\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother is already unparalleled in his generation. It\u2019s just a matter of time before he ascends to become an Emperor. The same cannot be said for your Prince, he couldn\u2019t even withstand a single strike from our Elder Senior Brother. I\u2019m afraid he won\u2019t have much of a shot within this lifetime.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s bullsh*t! Our Crown Prince had continuously defeated six sage orthodoxies. Every Daoist from those orthodoxies couldn\u2019t withstand a single punch from him. It\u2019s him who\u2019s truly unparalleled.\u201d\u201cPfft, you think your Crown Prince is good? He\u2019s lucky that I was still in Closed Door Cultivation when he visited. Otherwise, I would\u2019ve long stopped his invincible streak long before Chu Kuangren could!\u201d Yuanhong from the Dharma Sect claimed.\u201cI\u2019ve now transcended into the Paradise Realm! If the Crown Prince is brave enough, have him come over for a rematch!\u201d Fangtian from the Five Ways Sect announced.What started out as a quarrel only between the Azure Royal Dynasty and Black Heaven Sect soon involved all the sky-prides from every major sage orthodoxy in Azure Dragon Domain.At last, the Royal Azure Dynasty issued an imperial edict.It roughly went like this.Princess Linglong of the Royal Azure Dynasty was looking for a Daoist companion. Hence, a martial art exchange would be held and the winner of the event shall be wedded as her husband.Upon the announcement of the edict, everyone reacted in an uproar.To become the husband to the princess of the Royal Azure Dynasty was a huge deal. After all, it was a sage orthodoxy.One could have all the resources, connections, and knowledge that one could ever ask for.It was a golden opportunity to ascend to a higher level.Besides, rumors had it that Princess Linglong was a woman with unprecedented beauty. She was almost as attractive as the White Lotus maiden sage.To marry her was to be blessed with an endless source of happiness.Beauties, power, wealth, resources\u2026Everything a man could ever ask for.Soon enough, cultivators from all across the world flocked to the Royal Azure Dynasty!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 46": "Chapter 46: The Honorable Bows, Off To Royal Azure DynastyIn the guest room of White Jade Hotel.Chu Kuangren opened his eyes and awakened from a deep meditative state.His cultivation base had massively improved from the initial stage of Nascent Soul Realm into full Nascent Soul, leaving only a half step before ascending into Paradise Realm.\u201cThe Primordial Purple Haze is unique indeed. The remaining effect was enough for my cultivation to trespass several smaller realms, whereas the Daoist intuition I gained while absorbing the haze will certainly be helpful in future cultivations.\u201dChu Kuangren smiled pleasingly.Although his cultivation had only reached full Nascent Soul, his Daoist intuition had far surpassed that of people in this realm, perhaps not losing even to a Battle Monarch.In fact, it could even be comparable to an Honorable One.The Primordial Purple Haze was powerful.\u201cYoung one, looks like you\u2019ve made some decent progress.\u201dSeventh Forefather\u2019s voice appeared from thin air.Then, a ripple began to appear within an empty space as the Seventh Forefather emerged from within. He was a middle-aged man dressed in white robes with facial features resembling that of a heroic general.\u201cGreetings, Seventh Forefather,\u201d Chu Kuangren stood up and gave the fist-palm salute. He had only just found out about Seventh Forefather\u2019s identity as the seventh Sect Leader of the Black Heaven Sect, a status few tiers higher than his Honorable Teacher.He would not have thought that Seventh Forefather would become his Daoist Protector, especially during the time when he was in Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five.Chu Kuangren felt a sense of respect towards Seventh Forefather welling within him.\u201cPlease, it\u2019s me who\u2019s supposed to greet you properly. If it weren\u2019t for you, I won\u2019t be who I am right now,\u201d Seventh Forefather expressed his gratitude and proceeded to bow towards Chu Kuangren as his way of greeting.If word spread that a Supreme Honorable had bowed to a young junior, many would have been appalled by the news.Chu Kuangren hastily tried to stop him and said, \u201cSeventh Forefather, don\u2019t you think you\u2019re being too generous? Judging by your status, I\u2019m not fit to receive such grace from you.\u201d\u201cOh but you do,\u201d Seventh Forefather reiterated. Cultivators who had never been through the Heavenly Deterioration Stage Five could never imagine the pain he went through.It was agonizing to be unable to do anything but watch oneself slowly deteriorate from one\u2019s peak into death.Chu Kuangren\u2019s Life Extension Pill not only allowed him to return to his peak and lengthened his lifespan, but it also gave him another precious opportunity to pursue the supreme path. It was not an exaggeration to suggest that Chu Kuangren was the equivalence of his parents reincarnated.Seventh Forefather had sworn in his heart that his life now belonged to Chu Kuangren, and that he would protect Chu Kuangren till his last breath.Chu Kuangren did not persuade Seventh Forefather any further. When prompted again about the origin of the Life Extension Pill, Chu Kuangren merely said that he had found it amongst Yuan Ling\u2019s treasures. After all, it was unlikely that Seventh Forefather understood all there was to know about Yuan Ling\u2019s treasures.After he exited the room, Chu Kuangren came to see Lan Yu who was leaning against a tree.She was in a blue-white blouse, and her silver hair was resting gracefully on her shoulder. Her beauty had completely undermined the scenery behind her.\u201cThis lady has been guarding you ever since she recovered two days ago and has never left. Such a good lady,\u201d Seventh Forefather said telepathically.Chu Kuangren nodded, \u201cA good lady indeed.\u201d\u201cMaster.\u201dSensing that Chu Kuangren had exited from isolation, Lan Yu went and greeted him.\u201cHow are your wounds?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re gone.\u201d\u201cThank you for all you did in the past two days,\u201d Chu Kuangren said gently as he reached out and grabbed a fallen leaf that was on Lan Yu\u2019s head.Lan Yu felt her heart racing as butterflies fluttered in her stomach. Blushes began to appear on her elegant face.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s alright.\u201d\u201cCoughs.\u201dThe sound of a man came from aside, and that man was Li Xingchen.Lan Yu immediately resumed her usual indifferent, fierce expressions, and stared directly at Li Xingchen.For reasons unknown to him, Li Xingchen felt a chill down his spine.\u201cBrother Li, it\u2019s been a few days since we last met. How are you?\u201dChu Kuangren smiled and greeted Li Xingchen.\u201cOh, Brother Chu, if only you knew. During your days of closed-door meditation, things have gotten messy out there,\u201d Li Xingchen replied excitedly.\u201cOh, how messy?\u201dChu Kuangren laughed.\u201cWhat do you think? Obviously, it has to do with you killing Honorable Swordsman White Cloud,\u201d Li Xingchen was still incredulous about what happened.When cultivators left their sects to train, they always started small. This commonly involved killing thieves, beasts or maybe participating in some martial art matches.For Chu Kuangren, he immediately went on to kill a Supreme Honorable the moment he left his sect!Why was he still training if he was so strong?!Li Xingchen then proceeded to narrate everything that unfolded in the past few days.Chu Kuangren was not too surprised. After all, there were only so few Supreme Honorables in Azure Dragon Domain, the death of any of them would surely yield a dramatic reaction.Whatmore if the death was caused by a junior cultivator like him. It would be weird if people were not overreacting to the news. However, what was bizarre to him was the quarrels that ensued between the various sage orthodoxies.On top of that was the martial art exchange matchmaking.Who would have thought a sage orthodoxy would pull off something like this?\u2026\u201cBy the way, Brother Chu, are you attending the matchmaking?\u201dLi Xingchen asked.\u201cWhy should I go? I have absolutely no interest in Princess Linglong,\u201d Chu Kuangren shook his head and said.Li Xingchen said, \u201cPrincess Linglong is considered one of the few top beauties in this realm, are you sure you aren\u2019t interested at all?\u201d\u201cIf you put it that way, maybe a little. Still, no matter how pretty she is, could she be as pretty as Lan Yu?\u201d Chu Kuangren smiled and said.Lan Yu\u2019s lips curled slightly as she was bathed with joy.Li Xingchen laughed and replied, \u201cLan Yu\u2019s beauty is unparalleled, there\u2019s undoubtedly only a few who could surpass her in beauty. However, Princess Linglong isn\u2019t that bad at all. In fact, rumor has it that her body is carrying a\u2026 Godly Daoist Physique.Chu Kuangren became more alert and said, \u201cYou mean\u2026 the Godly Daoist Physique that could allow a cultivator to boost their cultivation base and enter an Enlightenment Stage on their nuptial night?\u201d\u201cExactly.\u201dLi Xingchen smiled in a manner that only men could relate to.There existed plenty of mysterious and unique objects in this huge world. A Godly Daoist Physique was a Daoist Physique that could only be rivaled by a Supreme Daoist Physique.The Godly Daoist Physique was unique. It allowed the owner to release a unique Godly Essence in their first intercourse, which would allow a cultivator to boost their cultivation base and enter an Enlightenment Stage.Since ancient times, anyone who possessed this physique, both men and women, had piqued the romantic interest of countless cultivators. Some might say that it was not romantic interest, but greed.\u201cFortunately, Princess Linglong is the princess of the Royal Azure Dynasty. Otherwise, her gift would have been long stolen by others.\u201d\u201cHmm,\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded.\u201cThe martial art exchange matchmaking has invited the sky-prides from many sects, even those outside of Azure Dragon Domain. It\u2019ll surely be a crowded event. I\u2019m planning to start the journey within the next few days. Brother Chu, are you really not going?\u201dLi Xingchen asked Chu Kuangren again.Chu Kuangren contemplated for a while before replying, \u201cIn that case, we should go.\u201dHe did not agree to go because of Princess Linglong. Rather, Chu Kuangren wanted to expose himself to the world as much as he could.Now that sky-prides from all over the world were heading towards the Royal Azure Dynasty, what better place to gain exposure than there?\u201cHehe, Brother Chu, with your impressive abilities, you\u2019ll surely earn the grand prize of the martial art exchange matchmaking,\u201d Li Xingchen once again smiled mischievously.Chu Kuangren rolled his eyes and said, \u201cYou\u2019re thinking too much now. I\u2019m just curious to meet the sky-prides from all over the world. The matchmaking is the least of my priorities.\u201d\u201cOf course, of course,\u201d Li Xingchen was still giggling.Chu Kuangren shook his head. He did not bother to explain any further.Three days later.Chu Kuangren and the two others started their journey towards the Royal Azure Dynasty.The distance between White Cloud City and Royal Azure Dynasty was millions of miles apart. However, there existed a transportation system in Firmament Star that was called the Goddess Evoke Ship. With the consumption of a few soulstones, it would allow a person to travel vast distances within a short amount of time.The trio boarded the Goddess Evoke Ship and arrived at the palace of Royal Azure Dynasty in approximately two days\u2019 time.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47: Orthodoxies Feud, Fangtian Initiates A Challenge, Are You Qualified?The Capital City of Royal Azure Dynasty!Unlike other sage orthodoxies, the Royal Azure Dynasty functioned like a country. It boasted vast territories and was a far more sophisticated city than White Cloud City.There were several cultivation shops on the main street, where many cultivators flocked the area. Occasionally, one could even see several Paradise Realm expert cultivators roaming around.\u201cWow, this Capital City is so sophisticated,\u201d Chu Kuangren said.\u201cI know, right? No one would suggest otherwise.\u201dBoom\u2026Then, an explosion happened at the end of the street, catching everyone\u2019s attention.\u201cSomeone\u2019s dueling. Quick, let\u2019s go watch.\u201d\u201cAnother exciting piece of drama to see.\u201d\u201cThe sky-prides from all over the places have been flocking to this Capital City in the past few days. As the saying goes, there can never be two tigers in one territory. It\u2019s definite that something would happen when they\u2019re all here.\u201dThe crowd rushed towards the end of the street.Li Xingchen dragged Chu Kuangren along.On the rooftop of a high-rise building, two youngsters were facing each other directly. Their strong battle poises were evident.\u201cLooks like Zhiyang Valley has decided to join the party, too. However, if you think you can get to the princess, you\u2019re better off living a fool\u2019s dream,\u201d a cultivator dressed in white robes said.On the other side, the Zhiyang Valley cultivator did not let his opponent have his way, either. He said, \u201cNevermind if I can marry the princess, but as long as I\u2019m here, the Serene Wisdom Sect shall never stand a chance.\u201d\u201cYou bastard!\u201d\u201cYou fool!\u201d\u201cF*ck you, make a move if you have the guts!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s afraid? The only concern I have is you chickening out.\u201dThe Daoists from two large sage orthodoxies were cursing at each other even before clashing in battle.Chu Kuangren and his group made it to the scene.\u201cLooks like it\u2019s Huayun from Serene Wisdom Sect and Lin Batian of the Zhiyang Valley. No wonder they\u2019re fighting,\u201d Li Xingchen said.Chu Kuangren was puzzled and asked, \u201cWhy\u2019s that the case?\u201d\u201cBrother Chu, these two sage orthodoxies have had a long-standing feud with one another. Legend has it that the Founding Forefathers of both sage orthodoxies were once competing fiercely over the same woman.\u201cLater on, the woman ended up refusing both of their attempts, but the two did not resolve their issues at all. In fact, throughout the development of their orthodoxies, the two groups quarreled for many reasons. At some points, it even nearly sparked a war between the two orthodoxies.\u201dLi Xingchen said.Chu Kuangren was nearly speechless from Li Xingchen\u2019s explanation. He asked, \u201cJust like that? Which woman was so attractive that it made the forefathers so infatuated?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Li Xingchen shook his head. He had only gotten his information from words of mouth, as well. However, it was widely known that Zhiyang Valley and Serene Wisdom Sect had long been at odds, it was then unsurprising that their Daoists were always fighting.Above the high-rise building, the two youngsters were battling even more fiercely. Their explosive Daoist rhymes spread all over the battleground, attracting the attention of many cultivators.Amongst the spectators were also several sky-prides who came to participate in the matchmaking.\u201cThese two orthodoxies are never going to change. It\u2019s so childish,\u201d a young cultivator dressed in white clothes dissed.Then, he shifted his attention away from the battle and scanned across the crowd. Suddenly, he saw a familiar face and immediately shouted in surprise, \u201cIt\u2019s him!\u201dIt was Chu Kuangren that the youngster saw.Despite it being a sizeable crowd, he still managed to see Chu Kuangren. Those deity-like features were more eye-catching than the battles between the sky-prides above.\u201cGreat, finally I get to meet you.\u201dThe youngster laughed coldly.In the past few days, Chu Kuangren\u2019s name had been spread by many across the world. Naturally, portraits of his face spread along with his reputation as well, which was why the youngster was able to recognize the face he saw.The elegant facial features were so recognizable that it could only belong to one person in this world.\u201cHow can I help you?\u201dChu Kuangren turned his body and saw the approaching youngster.Amid Chu Kuangren\u2019s confusion, the youngster loudly announced,\u201d I am Fangtian from the Five Ways Sect, and I would like to hereby challenge you, the Elder Senior Brother from the Black Heaven Sect!\u201dHis voice was so loud, it echoed across the entire street.Instantly, the crowd was in an uproar.Even the sky-prides who were in the middle of their battle stopped and looked at the crowd.\u201cThe Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect\u2026 it\u2019s Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Chu Kuangren, the person who declared war against the entire world. Looks like he\u2019s here too!\u201d\u201cHaha, where\u2019s the Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect? Have him come out and face me, I would like to see how good is the so-called supreme sky-pride.\u201d\u201cDamn it, it\u2019s the brute that killed an Honorable One!\u201d\u201cIt was only because of the Primordial Purple Haze that he managed to kill Honorable Swordsman White Cloud. In terms of cultivation base, Honorable Swordsman White Cloud would have easily crushed him with one finger.\u201dAll the cultivators were shocked.Chu Kuangren\u2019s reputation was well-known.It was comparable to the reputation of a Supreme Honorable.Becoming a Supreme Daoist Physique, declaring war against the world, killing a Supreme Honorable, possessing the Yuan Ling treasure\u2026 all of these events were already heard by most cultivators, even if they did not pay particular attention to Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren\u2019s lips twitched a little.Who was this person?Did he need to speak so loudly?It was childish of him to initiate a challenge so rashly.Chu Kuangren, bearing the features of a goddess, was immediately identified by most of the crowd when Fangtian shouted his name.Many gasped in shock upon seeing him.Many female cultivators brightened up too.\u201cI didn\u2019t know such a handsome person could exist in this world.\u201d\u201cMy God, if I were Princess Linglong, I would\u2019ve canceled the matchmaking and have the Dynasty King grant a marriage for us.\u201d\u201cAgreed, he\u2019s too good-looking.\u201d\u201cSuch unique features, is he a deity who descended from the sky?\u201d\u201cThe silver-haired woman beside him is such a beauty. From the way I see it, even Princess Linglong pales in comparison to her.\u201dThe crowd\u2019s chattering sound became louder.Meanwhile, as Fangtian inched closer to Chu Kuangren, mysterious Daoist rhymes flowed from within his body, seemingly altering between the Five Elements of the physical realm.Li Xingchen said to Chu Kuangren, \u201cBrother Chu, he\u2019s Fangtian, a Daoist from the Five Ways Sect. He once said openly that if he sees you, he\u2019ll let you have a taste of what the Five Ways Sect is capable of.\u201cNot only that, I\u2019ve heard that he\u2019s ascended to Paradise Realm ever since he was last defeated by Gu Changge. You should be careful, good luck!\u201dLi Xingchen retreated immediately after finishing his sentence.He proceeded to cheer for Chu Kuangren from the crowd.Chu Kuangren glared at Li Xingchen. Some best friend!\u201cMaster, let me handle this,\u201d Lan Yu said.Chu Kuangren felt comforted.At the end of the day, Lan Yu was still the most reliable companion he had.\u201cWhat now? The Elder Senior Brother has chosen to hide behind a woman?\u201d Fangtian sneered at Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren looked at Fangtian in indifference and said, \u201cIf you couldn\u2019t even defeat Lan Yu, why would I bother wasting my energy?\u201dLan Yu raised her chin slightly and said, \u201cNot everyone has the privilege to challenge my Master. Are you qualified to do so?\u201dThen, her blue-white dress faded in a glimmer of light and was replaced by a set of shiny silver-white armor. Her wings spread outwards as she positioned herself into her combat stance.The crowds were astonished, \u201cA Winged Human!\u201dWithin Firmament Star, there existed tribes aside from humans, such as Winged Human Tribes, Yasha Tribes, and Ashura Tribes.There were even the Sage Tribes, which was equivalent in might to a sage orthodoxy.\u201cHilarious! You\u2019re just a personal maid and you wish to stop me?\u201dFangtian let out a battle roar and a golden orb began to glow in his palm. Then, a stream of sharp sword qi was ejected from it.Daoist Element of the Five Ways, Gold!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48: Princess Linglong, His Looks Are Too HandsomeThe Daoist Rhymes which overflowed from the sharp golden sword headed towards Lan Yu menacingly!That single blow was filled with the poise of a fully complete Nascent Soul cultivator!When Lan Yu was first summoned, she was only at an early stage of Nascent Soul cultivation. Now she was at the last stage, and along with the benefits of her Supreme Daoist Physique, even a Paradise Realm cultivator could not make a dent in her. She shattered that sword qi with a single punch!Fangtian had a look of shock in his eyes, which later turned into an intent to fight. He spoke in a cold tone, \u201cAlright, it looks like I\u2019ve underestimated you. Then I shall start by defeating you, then I\u2019ll beat down your master!\u201d\u201cNot a chance.\u201d Lan Yu immediately summoned her scepter of light. The sacred weapon\u2019s aura greatly increased her momentum.She let out a single punch, which erupted as a mighty stream of light. That blast managed to push back even a skilled Sky-pride like Fangtian by several feet.The onlooking cultivators could not help but marvel at the sight of that.\u201cThis woman has such tremendous power that she is able to push back Fangtian?\u201d\u201cFangtian is a Paradise Realm cultivator you know. It was estimated that even the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Crown Prince Gu Changge would have trouble pushing him back, but this woman can do it. Who the hell is she?\u201d\u201cWhen did the Winged Human Tribe ever have such a powerful Sky-pride, much less one that would be willing to become Chu Kuangren\u2019s follower? This is simply incredible indeed.\u201dAs the crowd was shocked at Lan Yu\u2019s strength, they were even more curious about Chu Kuangren\u2019s now because of this.If a follower had such terrifying levels of power, then what about Chu Kuangren himself?\u201cFive Ways, Defying Flame technique!\u201d Fangtian made a mysterious sign with his hand, which made the Daoist Rhymes swirl and gather around him, followed by crimson flames that surged out.Lan Yu did not bother to dodge it and sent out a punch instead. The poise of light smashed through the flames which rose into the sky, her dignified battle maiden look shook the crowd.\u201cFive Ways, Second Wood technique!\u201dFangtian\u2019s look became sterner and sterner. The Daoist Rhymes around his body cumulated and gathered while spiritual power in his body swirled, reaching maximum exertion.Around Lan Yu\u2019s body, countless vines formed by spiritual energy suddenly appeared and bound her in an instant.\u201cFive Ways, Seventh Gold technique!\u201d Fangtian took the opportunity to once again dish out another attack of the Five Ways technique, this time unleashing multiple sharp swords towards her.\u201cHmmph.\u201d Lan Yu sighed gently. The spiritual energy within her erupted and with the flaps from her snowy white wings, numerous streams of spiritual qi in the form of swords swirled around and subsequently cut off all the vines that were entangling her one by one. She then let out another punch attack.That punch of light ruptured all the incoming rays of sword qi before her.\u201cHow dare you seek to challenge my master when you only have such power. Stop living a fool\u2019s dream!\u201d Lan Yu let out a chilling laugh.Lan Yu\u2019s words enraged Fangtian greatly. \u201cHow dare you, a maid, speak with such arrogance. Witness the might of the Five Ways Sect!\u201dAt that time, swirls of Daoist Rhymes could be seen surrounding Fangtian\u2019s body, an extremely terrifying aura was released and his body could be seen glimmering with five shining colors of light.Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth.The five-colored lights flickered within Fangtian\u2019s palm, forming into a boundless and horrifying power. It was so strong that it shook the surrounding space.\u201cSage technique, Five Ways Grip of Capture!\u201d Fangtian held out his arm in a clawing grip, the five-colored lights combined and formed into a large hand of colors.That attack was a sage technique, a fearsome one as well.Even cultivators of the same Paradise realm would easily get defeated by this technique.Lan Yu had a serious look in her eyes. Following that, a surge of white light burst into the skies from her body. Her wings spread out, and large amounts of Daoist Rhymes gathered and swirled. There were lines upon lines of great Daoist runes and flashing back and forth around her body, making her seem almost inhuman.The crowd looked with shock and awe at that sight of her.They felt the feeling and inclination of worshipping Lan yu!Some of the stronger Daoists squinted and were in disbelief.\u201cThis is a Daoist Physique transformation\u2026 the Endless Shining Light\u201d\u201cThe rumored Supreme Daoist Physique, the Holy Radiant Physique!\u201d\u201cShe\u2019s a Supreme Daoist Physique wielder!\u201dThose who recognized the Holy Radiant Physique were in trembling shock. That kind of physique had not appeared for many years.Similar to Chu Kuangren\u2019s Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, it was a type of Supreme Daoist Physique as well. She had the potential to reach the Emperor realm with that terrifying power.With the Endless Shining Light transformation appearing, Lan Yu received the increase in strength that it offered. She then waved her scepter of light and formed a long spear with swirling runes on top of it. Horrifying amounts of Light-based Daoist Rhymes gathered within that spear.Bang!The long spear burst out as it shot through the air, a crackling boom resounded within the surrounding void!That single attack was a peerlessly powerful one.Impacting the five-colored palm, the shockwaves generated by the clash of those two powerful energies violently rumbled the surrounding void. The surrounding buildings and structures started to shake as well from the tremor.Lan Yu stood still with swirls of light surrounding her, looking ever so majestic and divine.Opposite her, things did not look good for Fangtian. His looks said it all and were very grim. He could not believe his strongest strike could not defeat Lan Yu.If he could not even defeat a servant girl, how would he possibly hope to take down Chu Kuangren?When he thought of this, he let out a sigh.\u201cWho permitted you all to fight under the very feet of the emperor?\u201dAt that moment, a majestic and dignified female voice came from the sky.A carriage pulled by six divine horses could be seen leaping through the air, bringing along a horrifying domineering aura as it landed.The surrounding cultivators immediately kneeled. \u201cRespect to her highness Royal Princess Linglong!\u201dOnly cultivators from sage orthodoxies like Chu Kuangren and Fangtian stood still. Their status could be said to be equal to that of Princess Linglong.\u201cPrincess Linglong has appeared.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe we can get to see her this soon.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s see if she truly is as beautiful as the rumors say.\u201dThe other Sky-prides \u201cspoke\u201d through eye contact with each other.Fangtian and Lan Yu also stopped fighting.\u201cAll of you here are talented contemporaries of this generation, having a fight in public like this, do you think such conduct is appropriate in any way?\u201d Princess Linglong asked again.\u201cYour highness is correct.\u201dLin Batian, Huayun the others replied.The area here was under the domain of the Royal Azure Dynasty, while the person in front of them was the princess whom they would compete with each other in a fight for. Hence, they should not cause any disgrace for her.\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll let this slide on the account that everyone here is a newcomer in this domain, and didn\u2019t understand the rules of the emperor\u2019s capital. I\u2019ll be hosting a banquet tonight at the Thousand Island Lake. With regards to that, I\u2019m inviting all the Sky-prides to attend. Everyone is welcome to show their face at the banquet.\u201d Princess Linglong said.\u201cThe princess\u2019s invitation shall be honored by its guests.\u201dA few of the Sky-prides chuckled.\u201cElder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect, I shall be waiting for you at the Thousand Island Lake.\u201dAt that point, Princess Linglong suddenly uttered.Chu Kuangren stumbled.\u2018Why did you have to call me out directly, are we close friends or something?\u2019When those words came out, everyone had their sights on Chu Kuangren. They were filled with indescribable envy, jealousy, and hatred.Especially so for Fangtian, he looked like he wanted to chew up Chu Kuangren on the spot.Of all the Sky-prides in the land, Princess Linglong did not mention anyone, and only specifically called out Chu Kuangren. What did that mean?That meant that Princess Linglong already had a bias in her heart!In that race to become the groom, Chu Kuangren had unknowingly taken the lead.Some people were getting confused.\u2018Your highness, you should not deal such a strong blow to the people\u2019s hearts.\u2019\u2018You were messing with our mental states right now.\u2019\u201cYour highness, that guy is Chu Kuangren. He was the one who heavily injured the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Crown Prince.\u201d Someone beside her reminded.\u201cYes, I know.\u201d Princess Linglong calmly replied.\u201cUmm, didn\u2019t you say last time that you would not be merciful to him when the two of you meet?\u201d Another one recalled what she said previously with the other great Sky-prides.One of them was Princess Linglong.\u201cI remember well. It\u2019s just that I didn\u2019t expect at that time that this Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect would be so\u2026 Handsome.\u201dPrincess Linglong paused, seemingly shy because of what she said.Everyone\u2019s mental state collapsed.They did not expect that Princess Linglong was a person like that.\u2018F*ck this, so what if he has good looks, is that such a big deal?\u2019The people in the crowd stared daggers at Chu Kuangren, some were enraged to the point that they started gritting their teeth.The martial arts contest had not started yet, but most of the people in the crowd already felt like they had already lost.That made Chu Kuangren even more confused. \u2018Your highness, we don\u2019t even know each other that well. Could you stop messing with me?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 49": "Chapter 49: Want to Give it a Try, Princess Linglong Took ActionAfter Princess Linglong departed, she left a crowd of Sky-prides who were mentally devastated.Fangtian glared at Chu Kuangren and said, \u201cI\u2019ll be sure to defeat you during the martial arts competition for marriage, and prove to the princess that I\u2019m stronger than you!\u201d\u201cSame goes for me.\u201d Lin Batian added with a cold tone.Some Sky-prides let out a few harsh words.While other Sky-prides just viciously stared at Chu Kuangren.When the crowd started to disperse, Li Xingchen walked up and looked at Chu Kuangren with admiration. \u201cBrother Chu is truly remarkable, even someone like Princess Linglong can\u2019t resist your charms.\u201dChu Kuangren stood still and touched his chin. \u201cBrother Li, I suspect that this Princess Linglong is seriously messing with me.\u201d\u201cHmmm, how can that be? If I were a girl, I would definitely be entranced by Brother Chu as well.\u201d Li Xingchen replied.\u201cForget about it, let\u2019s stop here for now. We better get a place to stay first, chatting can wait later.\u201dThe three of them found a luxurious inn and stayed there.When night came, Li Xingchen took Chu Kuangren to the Thousand Island Lake to attend Princess Linglong\u2019s banquet there.The Thousand Island Lake, as the name implied, was an extremely vast lake with a large number of islands within it. Hence the name, Thousand Island Lake.The lake had beautiful scenery surrounding it, and the place where Princess Linglong\u2019s banquet was held was located on an island at the center of the lake.There was a royal palace hall there where Sky-prides from all around the world had gathered. That included a few of the more well-known disciples from sage orthodoxies, such as Fangtian and Lin Batian.When Chu Kuangren entered with the company of Lan Yu and Li Xingchen, everyone\u2019s gaze fell on him. Some were filled with curiosity, while some were filled with hostility.Chu Kuangren was already used to being the subject of everyone\u2019s attention. He casually went to find a place to sit.\u2018Look all you want, it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to lose a few pieces of meat if you do so.\u2018Besides, I\u2019m so handsome it would be a shame not to look at me.\u2019\u201cHer Royal Highness Princess Linglong has arrived!\u201dAt that point, a voice came in from outside the entrance.A woman in a gorgeous robe slowly walked into the hall.That woman, whose eyebrows were distant like the far mountains, whose lips were red like a scarlet pill, was wearing a Chinese-style dress. Her graceful and slender figure could be seen by all, as well as her noble elegance that was paired by her appearance which was even breath-taking.That kind of beauty she possessed was one of excellence, like a queen.Everyone also subconsciously glanced at Lan Yu who was sitting beside Chu Kuangren.Those two women truly possessed stunning looks.One who was cold and divine, yet inviolable at the same time.The other was peerless in beauty, yet difficult to approach.If Lan Yu were the snow lotus who grew only on high mountain cliffs, then Princess Linglong would be the delicate and rich dahlia flower. Each had its own beauty and charm.\u201cGreetings, Princess Linglong.\u201d\u201cPrincess Linglong is indeed as pretty as the rumors say.\u201d\u201cSeeing the royal princess today is indeed a worthwhile experience.\u201dThe crowd of Sky-prides all got up to greet and welcome the princess.Only Chu Kuangren alone calmly sat at his place. He took a closer look at Princess Linglong, and looked at Lan Yu. \u201cMy Lan Yu still looks prettier.\u201dUpon hearing Chu Kuangren\u2019s words, Lan Yu was on cloud nine and had an uncontrollable smile on her face, which added to her already alluring beauty.\u201cI see, so she\u2019s called Lan Yu?\u201dPrincess Linglong seemingly heard Chu Kuangren\u2019s words just now.\u201cLan Yu extends her greetings to her Royal Highness.\u201d Lan Yu held out her hands as she bowed.\u201cIt\u2019s alright, you\u2019re welcome.\u201dPrincess Linglong looked at Chu Kuangren and had an incredible smile on her face. \u201cSeeing that fellow Daoist Chu is able to attend this banquet, it makes me very happy indeed.\u201dThe crowd of Sky-prides was again very agitated by this.\u2018G*d d*mn it, not again.\u2019\u2018The princess only has her eyes on Chu Kuangren.\u2019\u201cYou\u2019re too polite, your Royal Highness.\u201d Chu Kuangren realized that this Princess was messing with him again. What kind of princess would behave in such an unreserved manner?The banquet had started.The crowds of Sky-prides kept looking around and sizing up each other.They all knew that everyone who attended this banquet would be their opponent in battle soon.Of course, they would take the advantage to scout out their opponents, especially Chu Kuangren. Everyone\u2019s eyes were on him, and all were very stern and serious as well.\u201cWord says that Daoist Chu relied on the Primordial Purple Haze to kill the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman and destroy the entire city hall. Those amazing feats of power from him were truly remarkable.\u201d At that point, a Sky-pride exclaimed.When he said that, everyone\u2019s gaze suddenly became a little strange.Hearing those words at first, it seemed that he was complimenting Chu Kuangren.Actually, it was on the contrary.Emphasizing the words that \u201che relied on\u201d, was a jab aimed at Chu Kuangren for killing the Honorable Supreme with the help of an item and not by his own strength and cultivation. Hence, it did not count.Leveling the entire White Cloud city hall to ruins was another jab at Chu Kuangren, indicating that he was cruel and murderous and merciless. He killed relentlessly without care, not letting even the elders or children go.\u201cSuch talent with words, you\u2019re like a weird sarcastic old fart.\u201dChu Kuangren gently smiled.Following that, he looked at that particular Sky-pride as he knew who that was. It was no other than Huayun of the Serene Wisdom Sect, the one who picked a fight with a Sky-pride from the Zhiyang Valley on the streets.\u201cWhen I killed the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman, it only took me two swings from my sword. So tell me, how many swings from my sword would it take for me to kill you?\u201d Chu Kuangren replied in a chilling tone.As soon as those words were spoken, the atmosphere suddenly became very tense.Huayun\u2019s expression changed, \u201cWhat is the meaning of that brother Chu? I have no bone to pick with you, so why are you threatening me in such a manner in public?\u201d\u201cCan\u2019t reply? Then why don\u2019t we try it out and see.\u201dChu Kuangren laughed and slowly stood up.His actions caused everyone present at the banquet to tremble.\u2018F*ck me.\u2018Was he really intending to kill someone at this banquet?\u2019Huayun\u2019s pupils shrank and his heartbeat rose. Being stared at by Chu Kuangren gave him the feeling that he was being entangled by a large poisonous snake and strangled at the neck.\u201cHahaha, the well known Chu Kuangren is truly magnificent!\u201dAt that point, a voice came from outside of the hall.A noble-looking man dressed in yellow robes stepped into the hall.\u201cThird younger brother.\u201d Princess Linglong saw him and greeted him.\u201cGreetings sister, your Royal Highness.\u201dThe person who came was the third prince of the Royal Azure Dynasty.His name was Gu Changfeng.Gu Changfeng took a look at Chu Kuangren and said, \u201cI\u2019ve long heard that brother Chu\u2019s cultivation level is very high, and I don\u2019t know whether I\u2019ll have the pleasure and honor to have a taste of it.\u201d\u201cYour Royal Highness wants to give me a try?\u201cAlright.\u201dChu Kuangren nodded in agreement.At the open space outside the banquet hall, Gu Changfeng went into his stance and said, \u201cMy elder brother, the Crown Prince was defeated by your hand. So do not blame me now, for I need to do something about it. So take this.\u201dThe moment the words fell, a stream of golden-yellow dragon qi shot out through the air. The dragon\u2019s roar reverberated through the air. His first attack was already the Sage Technique Dragon Slaughter Fist!Chu Kuangren\u2019s face was emotionless, he held his Descendant Self sword and swung it.The purple sword light beam suddenly lit up the night.That single slash was far brighter than the starlit sky above them!The light beam from the sword flashed by and instantly obliterated the dragon-shaped fist. That horrifying sword beam was unrelenting and had no signs of stopping. It headed straight towards Gu Changfeng.\u201cHow?!\u201dGu Changfeng\u2019s pupils shrank and his expressions changed.Seeing the sword beam approaching him, Gu Changfeng was powerless to block it and was not able to dodge it in time. A fearful look showed up on his face.At that instant, a figure appeared before him held up a palm from their hand, which released terrifying surges of spiritual power. It clashed with the sword beam violently, sending shockwaves which spread through all directions, rumbling throughout the whole island and the lake\u2019s water which surrounded it.\u201cIt\u2019s Princess Linglong!\u201d\u201cI did not know that the Princess has such a high level of cultivation.\u201dThe crowd was shocked and in fear.They were astonished by that slash from Chu Kuangren, and at the same time were surprised by the royal princess\u2019s cultivation level. All were dazed for a short while before coming back to their senses.\u201cHe is that strong!\u201dFangtian, who planned to challenge Chu Kuangren today was shocked mentally and his face was scared pale after seeing that person\u2019s single slash of the blade.He knew that he could not deal with that attack head-on!Not only him, but Huayun was also terrified to the point of his body shivering.He did not realize he was provoking such a terrifying person just now!He wondered then if Gu Changfeng were to arrive late, would he be the one who would have died, then?That night, Chu Kuangren amazed the crowd with a single slash, shocking all four corners of the banquet!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 50": "Chapter 50: Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor, The Princess Wants to Form a Marriage\u201cThe Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Crown Prince Gu Changge can\u2019t even take a single strike from my sword, and you\u2019re down after a strike at half-strength. No, that\u2019s not right, maybe Gu Changge was the same and can\u2019t even take half a strike from my sword as well.\u201d Chu Kuangren said childishly.Back then when he defeated Gu Changge, he had only just broken through and reached the early stages of Nascent Soul Realm cultivation. Now he was at the completed stage of Nascent Soul Realm cultivation. If he were to fight Gu Changge again, then he would definitely defeat him easier than last time.Gu Changfeng\u2019s face went pale in shame as he struggled to refute. If it were not for Princess Linglong\u2019s sudden intervention, he would not have been able to take the full blow of that sword attack.When the other Sky-prides heard of this, their expressions did not look good either.Word said that Gu Changge consecutively defeated the six great sage orthodoxies. Even if it were true, he was already not someone worth mentioning in the eyes of Chu Kuangren.What would they be, then?Some of them were not even as strong as Gu Changge.In the eyes of Chu Kuangren, that would mean that they paled significantly in comparison!This was a world where great battles and conflict were waged.It was supposed to be a clash of glorious battles between all Sky-prides from around the world.However, why did they all had the feeling that the stage now belonged to Chu Kuangren alone?\u201cHow can such a person appear in this era? What\u2019s the use of the other remaining Sky-Prides in the world then?\u201d One of the Sky-pride said in an unsatisfied tone.It could be seen that Chu Kuangren had too big of an impact on everyone.\u201cMy honored guests, I apologize for delaying this banquet, so everyone, please leave before me. I have some matters to discuss with brother Chu here.\u201dPrincess Linglong suddenly announced.When she blocked and withstood Chu Kuangren\u2019s attack, she was extremely calm.At that moment, everyone in the crowd no longer saw her as an ordinary princess. Instead, she was a top-notch Sky-pride!She could even be stronger than Gu Changge!The crowd of Sky-prides who attended left with mixed feelings, each of them buried in their own thoughts.\u201cBrother Chu, I\u2019ll leave you be with the princess to chat.\u201d Li Xingchen winked at Chu Kuangren and smiled.\u201cThird younger brother, please leave us be as well.\u201d Princess Linglong said.Gu Changfeng was hesitant.\u201cLeave us be, now.\u201d Gu Changfeng only left when Princess Linglong repeated with a more serious tone.Not long after, only Chu Kuangren, Lan Yu, and Princess Linglong were left.Princess Linglong took a look at Lan Yu, not letting her leave, and spoke to Chu Kuangren, \u201cIf I do not block that attack earlier, my third younger brother will be injured to the point of dying. Did you really intend to kill him?\u201dThe air around them carried a certain chill.Chu Kuangren casually replied. \u201cIf that is the case, what would you do?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s not true, you were forcing me to make a move.\u201d\u201cSince her Royal Highness has been messing with me all this time, I cannot stand by idly and do nothing. You see, I\u2019m not someone who likes being manipulated by others.\u201dChu Kuangren had noticed very early on that Princess Linglong was messing with him, purposefully speaking well to him and sometimes with lust as well. She was biased against him to manipulate the other Sky-prides\u2019 jealousy against him and cause him trouble. How could he not do anything in retaliation to that?\u2018If you mess with me, I would definitely return the favor.\u2019Upon seeing Princess Linglong, he used his Eye of Revelation to go through her stats and information at the first instance. She was at the Paradise Realm cultivation level, and her battle strength was stronger than Gu Changge, Fangtian, and the others. She was sufficiently strong to block that attack of his earlier on.\u201cIf I do not do anything, or if I do not react in time, then doesn\u2019t that mean my third younger brother would have died by your hand?\u201d Princess Linglong uttered.\u201cThat was my attack, so naturally I have confidence in controlling its power output.\u201dChu Kuangren was very confident in his Sword Dao.Even if Princess Linglong were to not react earlier on, he could also control the intensity of the sword beam in time to at least guarantee that Gu Changfeng would not be injured to the point of dying.\u201cAlright, then let\u2019s talk about the Princess who\u2019s now scheming against me repeatedly. Is this all to take revenge for your elder brother, the Crown Prince?\u201d\u201cThat wasn\u2019t scheming against you, I\u2019m merely just probing your strength.\u201d\u201cIt better be the case.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s discuss more inside.\u201dThe three of them entered another palace hall, where Princess Linglong then sat down and immediately asked, \u201cWhat do you think of me?\u201dChu Kuangren froze for a short while. \u201cYour Royal Highness, are you intending to ask my hand for marriage? Sorry to disappoint, but I really am not interested in you.\u201dHis words made Princess Linglong stretch her brows, speechless. Not interested?\u2018D*mn, I can have beauty, wealth, power, and any talents I desire I already have, yet there\u2019s still some guy who\u2019s still not interested in me?\u2019Princess Linglong, who had been accustomed to praise and kindness from everything under the moon and stars felt aggrieved inside, but she did not let it show. Like nothing happened, she then said, \u201cThen let me ask another question, what do you think the others are here for?\u201d\u201cMost of them came for the power, wealth, and positions of authority, but mainly to lust after your body. While some of them pay no heed to even that, and instead are mainly here to lust after your body.\u201d\u201cThat is \u2026 Quite straightforward of you.\u201dPower, wealth, positions of authority, resources. Those were the main reasons a large portion of the crowd came and attended the martial arts competition to ask her for her hand in marriage. However, cultivators from sage orthodoxies like Fangtian and Lin Batian did not really lack much of those.What they were here for was to lust after the body of Princess Linglong.Frankly speaking, they were after the Godly Essence within the Godly Daoist physique!\u201cCorrect, the Godly Essence within the Godly Daoist physique is a widely sought after treasure by all cultivators around the world. Because of this physique that I possess, I\u2019ve even become a target of a Young Emperor.\u201d Princess Linglong said.Chu Kuangren\u2019s expression changed slightly. \u201cYoung Emperor?\u201d\u201cThe Young Emperor of the Shang clan from the Scarlet Phoenix Domain! To seek the power of the Shang clan to strengthen the country\u2019s might, my father the emperor has already promised my hand in marriage to the Young Emperor of the Shang clan!\u201dYoung Emperor, short for someone who would eventually become an Emperor level cultivator.Every Young Emperor in existence was a peerless Sky-pride with superior combat power. Compared to people like Gu Changge and Fangtian, they were leagues above in terms of strength.There were a total of eight known Young Emperors on the Firmament Star. They were located in the four regions of the Azure Dragon, White Tiger, Scarlet Phoenix, and Black Warrior domains respectively.\u201cThe Young Emperor of the Shang clan sounds very powerful and strong. Then again, what does this have anything to do with me?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked.\u201cThe Shang clan\u2019s Young Emperor is a devoted Daoist. To him, I\u2019m just another tool to be utilized to help him in his cultivation. Once I\u2019ve exhausted my use, I\u2019ll be tossed aside and discarded on his whims.\u201d Princess Linglong replied in a resentful tone.Chu Kuangren was silent as he listened attentively.\u201cI\u2019m not willing to be such a tool, so I organize this martial arts contest for marriage in hopes of finding a Sky-pride that can deal with the Shang clan\u2019s Young Emperor. That person I\u2019ve chosen is you, Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cThe last time, I purposely messed with you by using others to confirm your strength. Now it seems I have not chosen wrongly.\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren, I want you to defeat everyone in the contest, including the Shang clan\u2019s Young Emperor. I want you to properly and officially become my consort!\u201cThis will be a collaboration between us!\u201dChu Kuangren quietly listened to everything Princess Linglong had to say.He understood now.Princess Linglong was an independent lady who was dissatisfied with the marriage arrangements made for her. Wanting to hide it from others, she planned to find a marriage partner herself, which ended up being him.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint, but I refuse to help. Firstly, I have the same amount of power, authority, and wealth that you possess. I also guess this so-called title of consort you want is just a guise for formality, meaning you won\u2019t even let me touch a single hair on you right?\u201cSecondly, I have no reason to get on the wrong side of a Young Emperor just because of you.\u201dChu Kuangren was not foolish.That title of a consort was something that was not the slightest bit attractive to him. The only one who would reap all the benefits would be Princess Linglong herself.\u201cSo you\u2019re afraid of the Shang clan\u2019s Young Emperor?\u201d\u201cToo bad provocation does not work on me.\u201d Chu Kuangren raised his brows. The Shang clan\u2019s Young Emperor? He did not know of the strength of that person for sure, but unfortunately, he was never afraid of anyone before.He could already kill an Honorable Supreme, so what was the big deal of a so-called Young Emperor?\u201cThree requests. If you promise to help me, I shall fulfill any three requests that you wish. I\u2019m her royal highness Princess Linglong, I possess the Godly Daoist physique and have achieved many great feats of brilliance. I can surely be of help to you in the future.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s something that even I cannot accomplish, then you won\u2019t even be able to do it either. Lan Yu, let\u2019s go.\u201d Chu Kuangren turned and left.Upon seeing the figure of his turned back, Princess Linglong gritted her teeth. \u201cDon\u2019t you want the Godly Essence? If you agree to become my consort, I can promise to offer you the Godly Essence and help you achieve great heights in your path of Daoist cultivation.\u201dThat was the last and most precious item she could offer.In her opinion, it was better to give it to Chu Kuangren than the Shang clan\u2019s Young Emperor. At least Chu Kuangren\u2019s looks met her requirements.\u201cI\u2019m sorry to disappoint, but I\u2019ve already said that I\u2019m not interested in you. I, Chu Kuangren, can achieve great feats in the Supreme path of Daoist cultivation without needing favors like these!\u201dAfter saying that, Chu Kuangren left without ever turning back.Princess Linglong was left alone with an unhappy and unsatisfied look on her face.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 51": "Chapter 51: Luminous Moon Artificial World, Sage Orthodoxies Sealed Off the Area\u201cHey Brother Chu, so how was it?\u201dAfter returning to the inn, Li Xingchen hurriedly went up to Chu Kuangren.\u201cWhat do you mean how was it?\u201d\u201cHow was it between you and the Princess of course.\u201d\u201cHow can anything possibly happen between us? All we did was discuss and exchange knowledge about the path of Daoist cultivation. I came back right after that,\u201d Chu Kuangren casually replied.He did not have the habit of spreading the personal affairs of others. The issue of forming a marriage was only Princess Linglong\u2019s matter to worry about. He would not agree to help, and he would not involve himself in that matter as well.\u201cHer royal highness Princess Linglong purposely kept you guys alone just to exchange knowledge about the path of Daoist cultivation?\u201d Li Xingchen teasingly asked again, thinking Chu Kuangren was kidding with him.\u201cNot everyone\u2019s minds are full of dirty thoughts like you, Brother Li.\u201dChu Kuangren replied as he rolled his eyes, not saying another word after.After that night, news of Chu Kuangren defeating the Third Crown Prince started to spread throughout the different circles of Sky-prides.Despite that, Chu Kuangren did not care about the kinds of disturbance that got riled up as it spread.The date for the martial arts competition for Princess Linglong\u2019s hand in marriage steadily got closer. Suddenly, something big happened within the royal Azure Dragon Domain just a few days right before the event.The artificial world of the Luminous Moon that had disappeared for tens of thousands of years suddenly reappeared in the air above the northern seas!\u2026Morning came.Chu Kuangren had just finished rolling from the lucky draw when Li Xingchen rushed into his room with an anxious look on his face, as if something serious had happened.\u201cBrother Li, what\u2019s up with you today?\u201d\u201cBrother Chu, let\u2019s go right now. You have to follow me to the northern seas.\u201d\u201cTo the northern seas? For what? Aren\u2019t we joining the marriage martial arts competition?\u201dChu Kuangren chuckled.\u201cIn the air above the north seas lies the Luminous Moon\u2019s artificial world, and there was once a sage that lived there and mysteriously disappeared for tens of thousands of years, and he\u2019s suddenly reappeared. If we don\u2019t go now, that opportunity will be taken by others. Participating in the martial arts competition for marriage is not something as important as this.\u201d Li Xingchen said.The Luminous Moon\u2019s artificial world?Chu Kuangren frowned curiously. Then again, anything that could be related to a sage would not be something simple. He became very interested due to that.After calling Lan Yu, the few of them headed out to the northern seas.Besides them, all of the great Sky-prides who were preparing to compete in the marriage martial arts competition and had been staying in the royal capital also headed towards the northern seas.Since that happened, the event had no choice but to be delayed.\u2026The turbulent waves of the northern seas were covered by the dark clouds above. A pair of silver-white gates could be seen, with the image of a bright moon pattern carved onto them.Surrounding the area, numerous groups of strong cultivators had already amassed.Even a few Honorable Ones were present as well.They glared at the Luminous Moon\u2019s artificial world with very stern and imposing looks.\u201cThe Luminous Moon\u2019s artificial world was the residence of the Luminous Moon Sage tens of thousands of years ago. There has been no news about that location since then, yet it has reappeared today.\u201dOne of the Honorables from Zhiyang Valley curiously commented.\u201cThe Luminous Moon Sage was a top-notch sage who defined the very era he lived in. He was not easily outdone even compared to a Sage Ruler, there must certainly be a lot of fortunate opportunities and items within his artificial world.\u201d Another Honorable said with a fiery look in his eyes.Although they were all from sage orthodoxies who had produced sages in the past before, those sages mostly were either dead or in a hibernating condition. Hence, the Sage treasures within were greatly sought after by them.Not to mention, there had not been any top-tier sages at the level of the Luminous Moon Sage that had come from the Azure Dragon\u2019s Eight Great Sage Orthodoxies.\u201cThere\u2019s definitely no lack of treasures and other items within this artificial world. However, we have to open the thing first.\u201d Elder Ruyan from the Black Heaven sect calmly uttered upon arrival as she looked at the Luminous Moon\u2019s artificial world.She was not wrong.There was a strong seal of restriction placed on the Luminous Moon\u2019s artificial world entrance. Even the Honorable Realm cultivators could not hope to approach it, leading all of them to stop nearby.They would have rushed in if that were not the case.\u201cWhile this seal is strong, it doesn\u2019t restrict cultivators below the Battle Monarch Realm from entering. We can let our disciples enter first to explore it, and whatever they obtain will be up to their luck and destiny.\u201dAnother Honorable Realm Cultivator uttered.\u201cThey\u2019re already rushing over here from the royal capital, let\u2019s seal off our current location and prevent those cultivators from taking the opportunity to slip in unnoticed.\u201dSaid another Honorable Cultivator ruthlessly. His thoughts were obvious.\u2018Even our sage orthodoxy cannot enter, so small fry like you should not even come and join in on the action, but immediately leave this place instead.\u2019Some of the cultivators were enraged upon hearing those words, but felt frustrated They could not do anything as they could not compete with the sage orthodoxies.Their oppression of the weak was an eternal and unchanging principle in the world of cultivation!Very soon after, a crowd of Sky-prides reached the north seas at the same time.Lin Batian from Zhiyang Valley, Fangtian of the Five Ways Sect, Huayun from the Serene Wisdom Sect, the Maiden Sage of the White Lotus School, and some others all arrived at the location.Chu Kuangren and the others also just arrived.\u201cWhat a crowd.\u201d Chu Kuangren looked at the crowd of tens of thousands of cultivators, all surrounded by the boundless crashing waves of the northern sea.Meanwhile, the higher-ups of a few sage orthodoxies had gathered at the central area closest to the Luminous Moon\u2019s artificial world. They were surrounded by their respective Sky-prides. All of them proudly levitated in the air, full of vigor in an imposing manner.Especially the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Princess Linglong and Gu Changge, who sat in horse-driven carriages surrounded by a battalion of well-equipped soldiers. Each infantry unit held their heads up high, their gazes filled with seriousness, clearly showing that they were battle-hardened soldiers who had experienced and survived life on the battlefield.The Royal Azure crown prince Gu Changge looked indifferent. He glanced around the area with a look of superiority in him like he was a Sky-pride of the heavens.Chu Kuangren took a look at him and said, \u201cWow, that guy has recovered well. I almost thought he would be unable to recover from back then.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s how these larger great orthodoxies are with their might and imposing manner.\u201d Li Xingchen replied frustratingly, lamenting that their White Jade Hotel could never hope to compare against the sage orthodoxies.After that, he seemingly stared straight at a certain direction in a daze. Pulling Chu Kuangren\u2019s sleeve, he told him, \u201cBrother Chu, take a look. That\u2019s the Maiden Sage of the White Lotus School.\u201dChu Kuangren followed his gaze and looked, and saw a lady in white robes among the group of Sky-prides in the sage orthodoxy.The lady had lush black hair with a glowingly delicate skin and a beautiful face. She was putting up a gentle smile, an expression that could captivate the hearts of many.Numerous Sky-prides stared at that woman in awe of her beauty, even the Sky-prides of the sage orthodoxies also could not help but look twice at her.\u201cMaiden Sage of the White Lotus School, Bai Wanqing. Cultivation level \u2013 Paradise Realm\u2026\u201dChu Kuangren checked her stats using his Eye of Revelation.He realized that of the Sky-prides of the sage orthodoxies, the White Lotus Maiden Sage was one of the strongest among them. Her strength was not far compared to Princess Linglong\u2019s.\u201cThe White Lotus Maiden Sage still has that gentle look, like the calm surface of a lake.\u201d Li Xingchen sighed suddenly.\u201cIs it bad having a gentle look like that?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked.\u201cBrother Chu, you don\u2019t know a thing about her yet. This Maiden Sage may look approachable, but she\u2019s like a rare mountain flower. I\u2019ve lost count of the men who had pursued her over the years, but all I know is that none of them succeeded. Besides that, I\u2019ve also never heard of her being together with any other man as well. There isn\u2019t even a hint of a scandal at all about her.\u201dWhile speaking of that, Li Xingchen paused and gave Chu Kuangren a weird look. \u201cThe only exception is that a few days ago, the White Lotus Maiden Sage openly declared that she wants to discuss the principles of Daoism with you, brother Chu.\u201dSpeaking of that, Li Xingchen\u2019s tone became a bit sour.Chu Kuangren shrugged. \u201cThat I did not know of.\u201dHe did not care about news of that sort.\u201cBrother Chu, my dear brother Chu, having Lan Yu beside you is enough. Why did both Princess Linglong and the White Lotus Maiden Sage decide to have their eyes on you?\u201dLi Xingchen said bitterly.\u201cBrother Li, take a look at my face.\u201dLi Xingchen turned to him for a while and his eyes started to water.He asked himself why Chu Kuangren was a man with world-class looks, yet he was leagues below him.No wonder both the White Lotus Maiden Sage and Princess Linglong treated him differently.When he thought of this, Li Xingchen felt a wave of sadness overcoming him.Chu Kuangren smiled and stopped messing around with Li Xingchen. He took Lan Yu and flew towards the direction of Elder Ruyan to greet her.\u201cGreetings, Elder Ruyan.\u201dElder Ruyan\u2019s eyes lit up. \u201cAh, you\u2019ve come as well, Kuangren.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 52": "Chapter 52: Supreme Spirit Blood Daoist Physique, Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Young Emperor, Just An Animal\u201cElder Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cGreetings Elder Senior Brother.\u201dStanding beside Elder Ruyan, Nangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and a few other disciples excitedly came forwards and looked at Chu Kuangren delightfully.\u201cGreetings fellow brothers and sisters, I hope everyone has been doing fine.\u201d\u201cHaha, Elder Senior Brother. We\u2019ve heard about the things you did these past few days. Because of this, your junior brother admires you more and more now.\u201dMurong Xuan held up his thumb and spoke in admiration.Nangong Huang spoke of nothing while standing beside him, but from his passionate gaze, it was not hard to see that his adoration for Chu Kuangren was increasing day by day as well.Chu Kuangren gently smiled and did not say a single word in return.Being too modest might make him appear too forced and fake while being too proud would easily make others jealous and hate him. Hence, at times like this one should display an indifferent look on their face.Sure enough, the gazes of Nangong Huang and the others became more passionate.\u2018Our Elder Senior Brother really is indeed the real deal. Having achieved all these earth-shattering feats, he can still maintain such an indifferent expression and heart. He really is a role model for my generation.\u2019The Honorables from the other sage orthodoxies took a few glances at Chu Kuangren.\u201cThis person is indeed the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother Chu Kuangren. The rumors were right, he does have an unrivaled look and an extremely refined manner.\u201d\u201cHonorable Swordsman White Cloud was murdered by him\u2026\u201d\u201cTalented people indeed do exist from generation to generation. It\u2019s just a pity that such a peerless Sky-pride did not come from my Five Ways Sect. What a pity, what a pity indeed!\u201d\u201cIn the world of great conflict, Sky-prides appear through all generations. This person here may just be one of the stars that shine the brightest and prettiest in this era!\u201d\u201cThis person can be known as a Young Emperor.\u201dEach of the Honorables all had a look of awe and splendor towards him.However, the other Sky-prides and disciples at the scene who saw that their elders marveling at Chu Kuangren and filling him with praise could not help but feel unhappy and unsatisfied within their hearts.Then again, in that moment they recalled the level of their opponent\u2019s might, that unsatisfied anger was lost instantly.Within the camp of the Royal Azure Dynasty.Seeing Chu Kuangren again, Gu Changge\u2019s heart trembled fiercely. The scene of a terrifying sword beam appeared within the depths of his mind.It was the sword beam from Chu Kuangren\u2019s single attack that defeated him.He thought that he had gradually forgotten about it as time went by.However, seeing Chu Kuangren again made him realize that he had not forgotten at all. He had suppressed that memory deep down within the inner part of his heart instead, not thinking about it ever again.\u201cChu Kuangren!\u201d Gu Changge gripped his fists, veins popping on his forehead as his eyes filled with rage and swelling anger.It was because of that person that his Heart of Invincibility was shattered. After returning to the palace, he had to expend countless priceless treasures to rejuvenate his body and recover.\u201cCalm down, elder brother.\u201d Princess Linglong gently said.Gu Changge took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He looked at the Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon with a fiery passion in his eyes.This time, he had to get his hands on the treasures and the Opportunities of Fortune within that Secret Realm.Only by doing that could he stand a chance of defeating Chu Kuangren!Not only him, but the other Sky-prides at the scene all also had the same idea: Getting the Sage\u2019s Opportunity of Fortune and surpassing Chu Kuangren!\u201cHaha, how can my Yasha Tribe be absent during the exploration of the Secret Realm of the Sage?\u201d At that moment, a great laugh could be heard from the clouds far away.An Honorable Cultivator\u2019s poise started to linger through the air.An elderly man in blood-colored robes could be seen arriving in flight.\u201cIt\u2019s him, the Honorable Ye Xue of the Yasha Tribe!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe he\u2019s here as well.\u201dThe people in the crowd were surprised.The Yasha Tribe was a different race from the humans. It could be said to be among the best tribes in the Firmament Star and could go head to head against the sage orthodoxies.That tribe was also known as the Yasha Sage Tribe!The elderly man in the blood-colored robe was a strong Honorable Cultivator of the Yasha Tribe. He used to excel over his peers back in the day and was among the top Sky-prides of that time. His other name was Honorable Ye Xue.\u201cGreetings fellow Daoists, I hope everyone has been doing well.\u201dThe Honorable Ye Xue let out a laugh to the crowd, and they returned the greeting politely. However, everyone also noticed a young man standing beside him.The young man who wore the same blood-colored robe as Honorable Ye Xue had a devilishly handsome face. There was a drop of crimson cinnabar between his brows, overflowing with Daoist Rhymes.\u201cWho\u2019s that young man? Why have we not heard of him before.\u201d\u201cAn unknown Sky-pride.\u201dThe crowd was astonished and observed silently.\u201cSpirit Blood Child; cultivation level \u2013 Paradise Realm, bred from and hatched by the sea of blood within the Yasha Tribe; Possesses the Supreme Spirit Blood Daoist Physique\u2026\u201dThe information obtained from the Eye of Revelation shocked Chu Kuangren greatly.A Supreme Daoist Physique.That Spirit Blood Child has a Supreme Daoist Physique!He had read about the Supreme Spirit Blood Daoist Physique in the archives. That physique could be ranked top thirty amongst the three thousand types of physiques. According to an ancient legend, there existed a great emperor once on the Firmament Star who possessed a similar physique. With that power, he managed to rule undefeated throughout a whole era.\u201cThat blood-colored robed young man can\u2019t be messed with.\u201d Elder Ruyan looked at the Spirit Blood Child and reminded Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren calmly nodded and said, \u201cHe has the Supreme Spirit Blood Daoist Physique.\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dElder Ruyan\u2019s expression changed slightly, \u201cHow do you know?\u201d\u201cI have a method of sensing, and I\u2019m able to sense it from him.\u201dSince there existed many similar sensing methods on the Firmament Star, Elder Ruyan did not think much about it. She then moved her focus onto the Spirit Blood Child.\u201cRecords regarding the Supreme Spirit Blood Daoist physique are little and scarce, hence I did not realize just now. Now that you\u2019ve said it, it somewhat makes sense .\u201dElder Ruyan said seriously.Nangong Huang and the others were reminded of Chu Kuangren, and it left an impression within their hearts. Each Supreme Daoist Physique wielder was no joke.Crackle, crackle\u2026During that time in the skies far away, dark clouds surged forth while thunder and lightning boomed and flashed.Several huge silver-while falcon eagles could be seen flying towards the surrounding area. Thunder rumbled everywhere and crackled as they flew.Similarly, an Honorable\u2019s poise lingered in the air.\u201cWho is it now?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s the Thunder Falcon Tribe! Another sage tribe arrives!\u201d\u201cHold up, if the Thunder Falcon Tribe is here, then that guy will also be here as well!\u201dThe many Sky-prides present had a stern look on their face.Chu Kuangren was a little surprised.\u2018Everyone here comes from a sage orthodoxy themselves. There are many sage orthodoxies that have arrived, yet I do not see you all being so cautious as the rest came. What\u2019s so special about this Thunder Falcon Tribe?\u2019\u201cSince the Thunder Falcon Tribe is here, then their Young Emperor should also be here as well.\u201d Nangong Huang uttered beside Chu Kuangren.Only then did he understand why.Young Emperor. There was a Young Emperor within the Thunder Falcon tribe!Several huge thunder falcons landed in front of the crowd. After a sudden flash of light burst forth, they all turned into their human forms. Among them was an eye-catching young man in a white long robe, whose whole body was overflowing with terrifyingly brutal thunder Daoist Rhymes.That man was the Young Emperor of the Thunder Falcon tribe\u2026 Lei Ao!The most outstanding one among the eight remarkable Sky-prides on the Firmament Star!\u201cThis Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon has really attracted a lot of people here. All kinds of groups and Sky-prides have all appeared on the stage now.\u201d\u201cAfter one finishes performing, the other will immediately carry on. It\u2019s very lively here indeed.\u201d\u201cEven if you can\u2019t personally enter and explore the Secret Realm, it\u2019s still a worthwhile trip to be able to witness so many rivaling Sky-prides that are present here.\u201d\u201cEven the Young Emperor is here too. I wonder whether Chu Kuangren can fight with him equally though. As you know, he was also dubbed the Young Emperor by some people as well.\u201dThe people in the crowd avidly discussed.Just as Lei Ao arrived, he gazed through the crowd of Sky-prides and loudly said, \u201cWhich one of you is Chu Kuangren, step out now!\u201dThe gazes of everyone swiped here and there\u2026Eventually, everyone in the crowd had their eyes locked onto Chu Kuangren.\u201cLooks like you\u2019re Chu Kuangren then. Someone said that you can be deemed a Young Emperor, what a joke! During this excursion into the Secret Realm, you better don\u2019t cross paths with me, or else I will show you what it means to truly be a Young Emperor!\u201dLei Ao was extremely domineering and already sent out a challenge without haste after arriving.Chu Kuangren only smiled gently. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, I thought only animals covered in fur barked and roared here like this. I want to kill you and turn you into a roasted chicken!\u201dThat moment those words went out, the other strong cultivators from the Thunder Falcon tribe were furiously enraged!\u201cInsolent fool!\u201d\u201cHow dare you disrespect our Young Emperor! That\u2019s seeking death!\u201dMultiple surges of poise from the experienced cultivators pressed towards Chu Kuangren.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 53": "Chapter 53: Strange Mystery Within the Secret Realm, Qi of Death, Full Moon BladeThat single word \u201canimal\u201d enraged every skilled cultivator from the Thunder Falcon Tribe.All of them stared daggers at Chu Kuangren as their momentum exploded. Terrifyingly violent lightning-based Daoist Rhymes reverberated through the void in the air and pressed towards Chu Kuangren.At that time, Elder Ruyan coldly asked, \u201cWho dares to make a move here?\u201dStepping one foot forward, a domineering aura that was close to the level of an Honorable One erupted instantly!The auras from the two sides clashed and rumbled the surrounding void.Chu Kuangren stood in front of the domineering auras indifferently. Normally, a cultivator would be so frightened by that power they would be petrified and immobilized on the spot.However, he stood his ground, calmly unmoved. The winds that were generated by the domineering auras blew through caused the ends of his robes and his hair to sway violently.At that point, he looked like a dark fairy, and even more so like an insane fairy!Many female cultivators were entranced by his looks.\u201cSo crazy, so wonderful.\u201d\u201cHe dared to insult a Young Emperor, this man is crazy and unrestrained.\u201d\u201cWhen you take a closer look at that Young Emperor, his looks are far below par when compared to brother Chu over there. Since he\u2019s the one who provokeD and challengeD Chu Kuangren first, I\u2019d say he fully deserves it.\u201d\u201cWell spoken, if one were to be provoked as such, naturally they would retaliate back in the same manner.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid the Young Emperor will not let this slide and surrender easily.\u201dNumerous female cultivators were secretly rooting for Chu Kuangren.They were also worried for him as well since Lei Ao was a Young Emperor. That title was a symbol of being one of the strongest among the younger generation.Seeing the Black Heaven Sect and the Thunder Falcon Tribe holding up arms against each other, the experienced cultivators from the other sage orthodoxies all wanted to guard their own interests. Hence, they did not stop whatever was happening.In other words, they wanted both sides to fight, so that they might have the opportunity to slip in and reap whatever rewards in the end.\u201cAlright, that\u2019s enough everyone.\u201dDuring that moment, the Honorable Cultivator of the Thunder Falcon Tribe calmly spoke.Not that he was afraid of Elder Ruyan; on the contrary, Elder Ruyan was only at the later stages of Honorable Realm cultivation. She was not a match for him.It was due to the situation surrounding the Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon being more important.Moreover, he could also sense that there was an even more terrifying existence within the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s camp, and was worried that it might be more powerful than he was.The experienced cultivators from the Thunder Falcon tribe grunted and retracted their auras respectively.Lei Ao stared at Chu Kuangren and cunningly laughed. He made a gesture of swiping his finger across his neck. \u201cChu Kuangren, I\u2019m going to be waiting for you in the Secret Realm!\u201dChu Kuangren snorted. \u201cOh wow, I\u2019m so afraid.\u201dWhen Nangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and the others beside him saw that, they could not hold back and let out a little laugh. Everyone knew that Chu Kuangren was not taking Lei Ao seriously.Not far away, the White Lotus Maiden Sage checked out Chu Kuangren with a calm unchanging smile on her face. The only thing new was the added curiosity she had in her eyes.Beside her, the White Lotus Bachelor Sage gripped his fists as the rage that filled his eyes almost seethed out.Almost all of the powerful forces and sage orthodoxies from all around the world had gathered. Following that, everyone then decided to start exploring the Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon.Since those above Battle Monarch were not allowed entry, those that qualify would be the Sky-prides from each group. After receiving advice and guidance from their elders, they were all allowed to set foot into that realm.Whoosh\u2026A blood-colored beam of light turned into a long rainbow as someone immediately took the lead and went into the Secret Realm.It was the Spirit Blood Child of the Yasha tribe.Fangtian, Lin Batian, Gu Changge, and the others followed suit right after.\u201cHey kid, I\u2019ll not be able to enter this Secret Realm, so you\u2019ll have to be ever so cautious when you\u2019re inside.\u201d The Seventh Forefather\u2019s voice resounded in Chu Kuangren\u2019s mind.Chu Kuangren nodded slightly and led the others into the Secret Realm.Upon entering the Secret Realm, Chu Kuangren instantly felt a surge of spatial energy dragging his body.Following that, a bright light flashed across his eyes, and the next thing he knew, he was somewhere beside a lake.However, Lan Yu, Nangong Huang, and the others were nowhere to be seen.\u201cWe must have been separated by some sort of spatial energy just now.\u201d Chu Kuangren frowned and let his spiritual thoughts flow and spread out. After searching outwards for hundreds of miles, he still could not find Lan Yu and the others.\u201cBased on Lan Yu and the others\u2019 abilities, they should be fine. Let\u2019s start first by exploring this area.\u201d Chu Kuangren thought.The area of this Luminous Moon Secret Realm was more vast compared to Yuan Ling\u2019s artificial realm that Chu Kuangren went to last time. The end of the Spirit Realm in each direction was out of sight.Chu Kuangren walked for half a day within the Secret Realm. He did not encounter anything like the Opportunities of Fortune. He instead found out that the area of the Secret Realm he was in was very\u2026 Corrupted!Within the Secret Realm, the water there was polluted, still, and dead, while the trees consisted of deadwood void of any signs of life. Not even a single sparrow or ant could be found anywhere.The heavens and earth in that realm were filled with a silent atmosphere of death.Some areas were even riddled with a gray-colored mist.\u201cThis mist seems unpleasant.\u201dChu Kuangren frowned and looked at the gray mist before him. He felt that the air around him was filled and permeated by a rotting death-like qi.At that moment, a chilling shriek could be heard from afar.Chu Kuangren moved instantly and headed towards the source of that cry.Within the mountain range, around ten well-equipped soldiers were surrounding and attacking a mysterious monster with black fur all over its back.That monster looked like a dog with its bloodshot eyes. It let out a menacingly frightful killing aura, which frightened everyone in the vicinity.The surrounding soldiers attacked the beast with swords and spears. However, their attacks were ineffective as the beast\u2019s hide was impenetrable.On the contrary, the sharp claws and teeth of the beast could easily tear through the armor on their bodies and critically wound them.\u201cStep aside!\u201dChu Kuangren darted out and came before everyone.With the Descendant Self sword in his grip, he swung the blade and let out an incomparably razor-sharp sword qi, easily splitting the beast in half.\u201cIt\u2019s Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cThank god, we\u2019re saved.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s truly a peerless Sky-pride, being able to defeat a monster like that.\u201dThe soldiers around him gave him a feeling that they were the remaining ones left behind by someone.Then again, there was only one type of soldier that entered the Luminous Moon Secret Realm, which was the ones that came from the Royal Azure Dynasty under Princess Linglong and Gu Changge\u2019s command.Chu Kuangren ignored them and investigated the body of the monster that he had slain. Its body also emanated the same aura as the gray-colored mist earlier, an aura full of decadence, decay, and rot.\u201cThis aura, what in the world is it?\u201dChu Kuangren murmured.\u201cThat\u2019s the Qi of Death!\u201d Right then, a female voice was heard from somewhere.From the distance came a woman in Chinese robes. The surrounding soldiers saw her and immediately saluted. \u201cGreetings your royal highness.\u201dThe one who came was Princess Linglong. Although surprised, Chu Kuangren was more interested in the Qi of Death that she had mentioned.Princess Linglong came and said, \u201cThis Qi of Death is very archaic, and can even be traced back to the time of the body of an ancient emperor. It has also appeared several times in eras without an emperor.\u201d\u201cThis Qi of Death is lethal and contains the very essence of death within. Any monsters or beasts which are infected by this qi will lose their minds and grow black hair or fur on their bodies. The records labeled them as\u2026 Black Death Beasts!\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s expression tightened after hearing those words.\u2018First of all, why did the Qi of Death appear inside the Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon?\u2019\u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the Luminous Moon Sage has fallen. According to ancient records, once the Luminous Moon Sage fell, red rain fell from the sky. The days were endless and a weird occurrence of a Heavenly Dog eating the moon happened. The heavens and earth are filled with sorrow because of this.\u201d\u201cBut why does the Qi of Death appear within his Secret Realm? This is very puzzling indeed.\u201d Even Princess Linglong was confused in thought.\u201cNo point thinking about this too much, let\u2019s continue exploring.\u201d Chu Kuangren said.\u201cAlright.\u201dPrincess Linglong nodded. There were indeed too many uncertain factors in this mysterious Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon. With another person around it meant another additional portion of strength gained. The two of them unspokenly partnered up and ventured out.\u201cLook over there!\u201dA blade could be seen stuck onto the ground, located on the peak of a nearby mountain. Multiple lines of runes and even a pattern of a full moon could be seen carved onto the sword.The blade stuck on the mountain peak was emanating surges of Sage Qi. Perhaps it was due to the influence of the Sage Qi that the surrounding lands around the mountain were still lush green, and not as ruined and decaying as the other locations.\u201cThe Full Moon Blade! The Luminous Moon Sage\u2019s sword!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This means there are still some Sage Daoist Rhymes on it, if one manages to comprehend it properly themselves, the benefit they would gain will be tremendous!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dNo matter the quantity, each sage orthodoxy would have at least a few sacred weapons of that caliber.Then again, sacred weapons that had residual Sage Daoist Rhyme on them were few and far between. That would mean the Full Moon Blade before them was an extraordinary sacred weapon. Its value as an item would be beyond priceless compared to normal sacred weapons.\u201cBut why is the Full Moon Blade stuck here?\u201dPrincess Linglong was puzzled.She glanced around the surrounding area nearby and saw a giant crack on the ground at the foot of the mountain. Along that giant crack, the surrounding mountains had their peaks destroyed. There were still remnants of Sword Qi around the top of the cracks.It was as if the Full Moon Blade was flung over and the sword qi from the blade left a path of destruction shown by those cracks. Then, as the sword ran out of power, it was later stuck here on top of the mountain.Could it be that the Luminous Moon Sage was battling someone?Was that what caused the Full Moon Blade to be flung out of the fight?Thinking of that, Princess Linglong was a bit shocked.However, no matter what the reason was, that sacred weapon was just in front of them. How could they not bother and leave it unattended?Chu Kuangren\u2019s and Princess Linglong\u2019s gazes crossed as they dashed out instantly.Both of them were unrelenting!\u201cThis sacred weapon is mine.\u201d\u201cWow, women really do change fast . Let\u2019s see whoever gets it first then.\u201dChu Kuangren chuckled, not being obscure at all with the speed he was going at.At that point, a flash of silver-white lightning erupted emanating with monstrous Daoist Rhymes. It blasted towards both of them at a breakneck speed.Princess Linglong\u2019s expression changed and she made a sudden retreat hurriedly.However, Chu Kuangren did not dodge nor back down as the Descendant Self Sword in his hands slashed forth and released a bright purple sword beam which destroyed the incoming lightning!Not only that, the sword beam headed towards the source of the lightning attack around the mountain ranges and instantly leveled a few mountain peaks.The terrifying power gave Princess Linglong an uncontrollable shiver down her spine.\u201cWhat a powerful slash!\u201d\u201cHe was not using his full strength during the banquet at all!\u201dPrincess Linglong was filled with jealousy within her.Initially thinking that her abilities were comparable to Chu Kuangren\u2019s with only a small difference between them, she now realized that she was fantasizing too much.Both of them were not on a similar level at all!The mountain peaks then exploded and out came a figure in white robes. His whole body was surrounded with delicate sparks of lightning, radiating an overbearing momentum which spread out in all directions.It was the Young Emperor of the Thunder Falcon tribe\u2026 Lei Ao!\u201cI can\u2019t believe we\u2019ve already meet so soon\u2026 Animal.\u201d Chu Kuangren giggled as he removed the Full Moon Sword stuck on the mountain peak and stored it into his Yin and Yang ring in front of Lei Ao\u2019s face.Lei Ao stared at Chu Kuangren. He recalled the might of his opponent\u2019s sword beam just now and grinned. \u201cVery well, it seems that you do indeed have some strength, that shall give you enough worth to die by my hands.\u201d\u201cYou really think you can kill me? Where did you get that foolish idea from?\u201dChu Kuangren snorted as the Sword Daoist Rhymes from his body emanated.However, Lei Ao was not afraid of a fight and accumulated the Lightning Daoist Rhyme in his body to the extreme. Dark clouds started to gather above him and sounds of thunder crackling could be heard.A surge of transformation energy erupted.\u201cBehold my Daoist Physique transformation, Thousand-fold Thunderclap!\u201d Lei Ao let out a great roar as thunder surrounded his body which made him seem like a thunder god.The mighty domineering force of thunder swept in all directions, beaming with the poise of a Young Emperor. Princess Linglong and the other soldiers could not help but feel mortified at the sight of it.\u201cIsn\u2019t that just a transformation? As if no one else has them, sheesh.\u201d Chu Kuangren\u2019s Sword Daoist Rhymes spread out, the Sword of The Heavens manifested above him while the Thirty Sixth-Tier Green Lotus Sword Qi was deployed and circled around his feet. The power of those two great transformations erupted!Boom, kaboom, boom!Horrifying levels of transformation energy all clashed together high up in the air.The surrounding landscape rumbled violently.Many Sky-prides who were exploring the secret realm nearby were attracted by the ruckus and went to check out what was happening.Atop an altar within the gray-colored mist, a figure bound by countless seals and great chains suddenly opened his eyes and stared a deathly stare towards the source of that transformation energy. He then burst into great bouts of laughter.\u201cLightning Daoist Physique, Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart, hahaha, these are an excellent assortment of consumables I can have! As long as I can absorb them, I will then be able to regain one ten-thousandth of my original strength and break out of this seal!\u201d\u201cAll that effort consuming my time and sage spiritual power to repair the secret realm while adding extra restrictions are all starting to bear fruit!\u201d\u201cLuminous Moon Sage, you can\u2019t keep me here forever!\u201d\u2026The force of the transformations all collided violently with each other as Chu Kuangren battled the Young Emperor Lei Ao alone.Chu Kuangren was a Supreme Daoist Physique wielder. Although he was only at the Nascent Soul Realm cultivation level, his three great Supreme Daoist Foundations strengthened the power of his technique transformations and made them stronger than that of Lei Ao\u2019s.There was no need to deploy all three, but only two transformations were enough to hold back Lei Ao\u2019s Thousand-fold Thunderclap transformation.\u201cThe Supreme Daoist Physique is really no small force!\u201d Lei Ao coldly said. He then gripped his five fingers, and bolts of terrifying lightning pulsed between them. He proceeded to let out a punch and a silver-white bolt of lightning shot out instantly.That bolt of lightning was even more terrifying than before due to the strengthening of the transformations!Unfortunately, it was useless!A swing from the Descendant Self Sword enabled the Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique to erupt forth. The menacingly horrifying purple sword beam which broke out with an unstopping might split the lightning apart!One slash and the lightning was split!\u201cThis sword beam can\u2019t be overcome by the silver lightning.\u201d\u201cWell then take a load of this, Black Water Falling Thunder! \u201dThe silver-white lightning surrounding Lei Ao turned into a dark ink-like color. The immensely darkened black-colored lightning was ever more menacing and possessed an even more domineering intent.A punch was let out as the Black Lightning managed to block the sword beam. After that, he waved both of his fists and caused jolts of black thunder to intertwine into a terrifying vast net that covered a large portion of the sky. It then started to went down towards Chu Kuangren.\u201cHmmph, what a useless technique!\u201dChu Kuangren swung his blade and a violent sword beam was let out. That was an unspeakably brutal and boundlessly offensive slash!The sword beam tore apart the black lightning web and landed onto Lei Ao, pushing him back hundreds of feet back and smashed him into a mountain.The rushing crowd of Sky-prides bore witness to these events as they arrived at the scene.They were immediately confused by that sight.The Young Emperor was flung back by a single slash!\u201cWhat\u2026 What the f*ck!\u201d\u201cAnyone who dares to tell me that Chu Kuangren does not deserve to be called a Young Emperor will have to deal with me! With that kind of strength, he definitely can be classified as a Young Emperor.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s too strong, that single slash has the domineering aura of a Battle Monarch!\u201d\u201cTerrifying, how terrifying indeed!\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s hair swayed as he held the Descendant Self Sword. His glorious look in that fight dazzled the crowds of Sky-prides and completely amazed them.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, didn\u2019t you say you were going to kill me? How can you even hope to fight me with that kind of strength?\u201d Chu Kuangren said casually.A pile of rubble exploded and out came Lei Ao, who flew out while staring menacingly at Chu Kuangren. His eyes were filled with a fit of indescribable anger and hate.Crackle\u2026Extremely dense black jets of lightning surrounded Lei Ao\u2019s body. Every jolt of it had the power to level mountains and divert rivers.Those jolts of lightning gradually formed into a large black lightning pair of wings with large amounts of runes carved onto them.The pair of wings flapped and horrifying powers of lightning swept through everywhere. Those that spread to the ground instantly blew up the land and sent dust flying.\u201cSage Technique, Black Wings of Lightning!\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren, let me show you my true strength!\u201dLei Ao\u2019s wings flapped and his figure seemingly turned into a jolt of lightning as he flew towards Chu Kuangren at an extremely fast speed in a blink of an eye.\u201cDie!\u201dHis fists waved and numerous streaks of lightning landed on Chu Kuangren.Most of the lightning was blocked by Chu Kuangren, but a few bolts managed to go through and injure him!After that violent attack, Lei Ao\u2019s anger was almost fully vented out and he immediately took a few steps back while laughing at Chu Kuangren cunningly.Even a Battle Monarch cultivator would no doubt be killed by the sheer power of that barrage of attacks he sent out.\u201cChu Kuangren, your body has now been corroded by the black lightning. That black lightning will gradually destroy internal organs and eventually your whole body!\u201d\u201cReally? Then why am I not feeling anything.\u201dAt that point, Chu Kuangren had a slight laugh and immediately let out another slash with his sword!The intensity of the sword beam was not weakened a single bit!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

He then flapped his black lightning wings, which released a terrifying surge of lightning that blocked the sword beam!He almost could not believe it.How did his opponent\u2019s strength remain the same?Why did his power not cause any effect on Chu Kuangren?\u201cWhat the hell is going on!\u201dNo matter how hard Lei Ao tried to figure it out, he did not consider the possibility that an ability far stronger than the Supreme Daoist Physique existed. It was known as \u2026 The Immortal Body!The black lightning from Lei Ao had indeed affected Chu Kuangren, as some lightning energy managed to get inside the latter\u2019s body and caused a certain amount of damage.However, those injuries and wounds were healed by the Immortal Body ability in an instant.\u2018Shouldn\u2019t you say that I\u2019m definitely a Young Emperor indeed?\u2019Chu Kuangren thought in his mind.Ever since descending down from the mountains, there was not a single person that had ever managed to wound him. That included even the Battle Monarch cultivators from the White Cloud City Hall.Unbelievably so, it was Lei Ao who managed to do it.\u201cNot bad for an animal. However, an animal will always stay an animal!\u201d Chu Kuangren\u2019s spiritual power welled up within his body as his Golden Jade Body deployed while his Sword-based Daoist Rhymes raged and surged.Just when he was about to resume the battle with Lei Ao, a wave of gray-colored mist suddenly crept forth from somewhere far away.\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d\u201cHow can there be so much of this mist!\u201dThe fog was surging unstoppably, forcing the onlooking crowd to retreat. Although no one knew what that was, they still did not dare to touch it.However, several tentacles suddenly reached out from the gray fog and entangled a few Sky-prides in a blink of an eye, dragging them into it.The turn of events caused everyone\u2019s expression to change greatly.\u201cWhat in the world is that?\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s leave, quickly!\u201dA crowd of Sky-prides dashed towards the opposite direction of the gray fog. Chu Kuangren and Lei Ao also stopped their fight as both of them decided to leave temporarily.At that moment, Chu Kuangren caught a glimpse of a few figures being trapped by the tentacles and were desperately trying to escape.\u201cIt\u2019s Nangong Huang and the others!\u201dChu Kuangren frowned and leaped forth without hesitation towards them. He landed before them and let out a hard slash with the sacred blade in his hands !The sword beam rushed forth and decimated the tentacles to bits!\u201cElder Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cHow fortunate, it\u2019s our Elder Senior Brother.\u201dNangong Huang and the others were delighted.Chu Kuangren however said with a stern expression, \u201cLet\u2019s go, quickly!\u201d\u201cElder senior brother, Lan Yu was also dragged into the fog just now.\u201d Nangong Huang suddenly told him, making Chu Kuangren\u2019s expression change drastically.\u2018G*d d*mn it!\u2019That gray fog really was a mysterious one. There was no telling whether Lan Yu could be dead or alive after being dragged into it. Chu Kuangren\u2019s anxiety rose within him, yet his gaze was as cold as ice.\u201cYou guys leave first.\u201d Chu Kuangren said calmly.\u201cElder senior brother, do you\u2026\u201dMurong Xuan\u2019s expression changed as he wished to advise him, yet Chu Kuangren who seemingly knew what he was going to say coldly commanded. \u201cLeave this place, now!\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s go now! We can\u2019t be here holding our Elder Senior Brother back.\u201dNangong Huang gritted his teeth and said.They took a look at Chu Kuangren and left right after.\u201cNot to worry, I have the Immortal Body. Besides that, I really want to find out what kind mysterious beings are living within this gray fog! \u201d Chu Kuangren took a deep breath and rushed into the gray fog, with an extremely sturdy gaze in his eyes.Far away, Lei Ao coldly commented upon seeing him do that. \u201cBold of him to rush into the Qi of Death, he\u2019s basically seeking instant death.\u201d\u2026Within the gray fog.A figure dashed right into it.That figure was Chu Kuangren. Upon entering the mist, he suddenly felt a strange force exerting its pressure on him.Under the influence of that strange force, his body felt like it had been drenched in acid. His skin and flesh was constantly being broken down and decomposed.The Immortal Body ability started to activate, repairing the damage to his body quickly. Chu Kuangren then urged forth his spiritual power to cover his body, using that layer of spiritual power to hold back the peculiar corrosive ability of the fog.\u201cThis gray mist can decompose and corrode living beings! I can\u2019t stay here for long. I need to quickly find Lan Yu as soon as possible.\u201d Chu Kuangren thought within his mind.Based on Lan Yu\u2019s abilities, even she would only be able to hold on for a while under this fog, only for a short period of time.Chu Kuangren\u2019s spiritual thoughts spread out in all directions as he kept searching for Lan Yu\u2019s whereabouts.Suddenly, his spiritual thoughts came into contact with a barrier and was reflected back at him. His gaze changed and he immediately let out a slash from his sword!The overwhelming purple sword beam landed on the barrier, exploding with a boom!However, Chu Kuangren could sense that the barrier was unscathed from his attack!\u201cThere\u2019s a barrier here. Can it be that it\u2019s here to keep us trapped in this gray mist?\u201d Chu Kuangren thought.At that point, sounds of fighting and strange roaring voices could be heard from afar.Chu Kuangren dashed towards the source of the sound and saw a group of tentacle monsters attacking and surrounding a lady.\u201cIt\u2019s her, Princess Linglong!\u201d Chu Kuangren said in surprise, not expecting that her royal highness was also dragged into the strange gray fog.Those tentacle beasts were very terrifying. Each of them had the cultivation level at the Battle Monarch Realm. Princess Linglong had trouble fending them off and could only dodge their attacks in haste embarrassingly.\u201cChu Kuangren, save me!\u201dPrincess Linglong had a very happy look on her face when she saw Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren turned his back instead without hesitation.What a joke, he had to go find Lan Yu first.Every second he wasted in this fog meant that Lan Yu could be even more in danger. Compared to Lan Yu, Princess Linglong was worthless in the eyes of Chu Kuangren!Seeing Chu Kuangren leaving immediately made Princess Linglong enraged and anxious. She shouted again, \u201cI know what is going on within this gray fog, help me please!\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s footsteps stopped when he heard that.The affected area of that gray fog was unknown and it would not be very effective if he were to look for Lan Yu aimlessly. However, if he could find out about the origins of that gray fog, then that might help somewhat him save her faster.Thinking of that, Chu Kuangren made his move without a second thought.The sacred sword slashed and out came that terrifying purple sword beam which pulverized the tentacles of those monsters in an instant!A shrieking infant-like cry could be heard from those strange beasts. Following that, the beasts all locked on to Chu Kuangren, their eyes red with cruelty and killing intent as countless tentacles all darted towards Chu Kuangren.\u201cAre these the monsters hiding within the gray mist?\u201cTheir cultivation levels are no joke.\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s Eye of Revelation activated.Strings of information all appeared hurriedly across his eyes.Those monsters were also a type of Black Death Beast.\u201cMutated Black Death Beast, cultivation level \u2013 peak of Battle Monarch Realm, developed and fed using the Qi of Death by the Black Light Sage, specifically used by him to capture living beings\u2026\u201dBlack Light Sage? Now who could this person be?Chu Kuangren picked out the key information from those messages and suppressed his doubts for a while. Then, he told Princess Linglong. \u201cGet behind me!\u201dPrincess Linglong did not think twice and did as he said, quickly hiding behind Chu Kuangren.\u201cI don\u2019t have time to waste dealing with you.\u201d Chu Kuangren took out a jade bottle from his Yin and Yang ring and proceeded to smash it.A burst of invisible dust spread out through the air. Chu Kuangren used his spiritual power to manipulate that dust and hurled it towards the Black Death Beasts surrounding him.Upon coming into contact with it, those Black Death Beasts immediately let out a screeching cry as their bodies started to disintegrate into blood.Around the time it took to take two or three breaths, the Black Death Beasts all turned into a puddle of blood and internal organs, exuding a foul disgusting stench.Princess Linglong trembled at that sight. \u201cThe Threefold Dark Ruler Obliterating Dust!\u201dShe had read about it in the old records but had never seen it in real life before. It\u2019s terrifying power truly horrified her.Those were peak Battle Monarch Black Death Beasts, and they all turned into a bloody puddle in such a short time. It was terrifying indeed!\u201cI can\u2019t believe I wasted a bottle of Threefold Dark Ruler Obliterating Dust because of this. I hope you better know about the secrets here, if not I\u2019ll make sure you will end up worse than if not similar to those beasts!\u201d Chu Kuangren coldly told Princess Linglong as he glared at her.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 56": "Chapter 56: Having Sky-prides As Food, A Sage Is Not Easily Killed\u201cDon\u2019t you worry, I\u2019m not lying.\u201d Upon seeing Chu Kuangren staring at her coldly, Princess Linglong could not help but feel a sudden beat in her heart.She was one of the best women in the world and also a Princess of the Royal Azure Dynasty at that, so why did she have to always forcibly yield when it came to Chu Kuangren?Princess Linglong was very puzzled.She then continued, \u201cThis gray fog here is special, it was made from condensing the Qi of Death. Taking into account the barriers all around its edge, I have read about this Qi of Death in the scripts that recorded situations like these. I\u2019m afraid that this is a type of\u2026 Domain!\u201d\u201cDomain? Carry on.\u201d\u201cAccording to ancient records, this kind of gray fog appeared around ten thousand years ago. At that time, it enveloped a whole city. When people went to investigate right after, only a few survivors were found remaining in that city, while the rest were all broken down and decomposed by the corrosion.\u201dPrincess Linglong stopped talking after that.Chu Kuangren frowned and asked, \u201cThat\u2019s all?\u201d\u201cThe records only kept note of this much.\u201d\u201cDomains\u2026 Battle Monarch cultivators can create their own domains. Besides that, some cultivators specialized in the practice of domain creation. As their cultivation level increases, the domains they create will also experience some change as well. Could it be that this domain is made by someone?\u201dChu Kuangren kept thinking and tried to piece together the pieces of information gained by his Eye of Revelation. His gaze gradually became very grim.\u201cThe Black Light Sage!\u201d\u201cThe Black Death Beasts were fed and developed by the Black Light Sage. Besides that, this domain has the possibility of being a man-made one. Hence, it has to be him that\u2019s pulling the strings behind the scenes.\u201cHowever, that person is a Sage. If he can even kill us with a single finger if he really wants to, why go through all this trouble? This domain, the Black Death Beasts, and even this Secret Realm could all possibly be his doing.\u201cThis may mean that he probably is under\u2026 Some sort of restriction.\u201dCountless thoughts were thrown around within Chu Kuangren\u2019s mind as they emerged.No matter what, the Black Light Sage could be the source of all their problems. If they wanted to get rid of this gray mist, then they would have to find him first.\u201cWhile searching for Lan Yu, we can also search for that person\u2019s whereabouts. If this domain really is his dirty work, then he must certainly be inside it as well!\u201dChu Kuangren decided on a plan and left the place.Princess Linglong followed him. She could not deny that in times like that, following Chu Kuangren would make her feel the most secure.Along the way, the two of them encountered another Sky-pride.It was Huayun of the Serene Wisdom Sect.However, he had already suffered major injuries at that point. His spiritual power was fading and he had no strength to muster up any protection with it. Without the protection of his spiritual power, his body started to break down and decompose instantly. Upon seeing Chu Kuangren and the princess, he immediately pleaded with them for help.\u201cPlease brother Chu, your highness, please save me.\u201dPrincess Linglong took a look at Chu Kuangren.It was clear that every move she made now was based on Chu Kuangren\u2019s decision.Chu Kuangren turned a deaf ear beside him, watching Huayun who was being corroded and decomposed non-stop. A sudden thought popped into his mind.\u2018The gray fog constantly decomposes and breaks down human flesh.\u2018Then what will happen next once it completely breaks down everything?\u2019The Black Light Sage went to great lengths to drag them into this domain field. Could it really be that he just simply wanted to kill them?When he thought of that, Chu Kuangren observed Huayun with a chilling gaze, having no intention of lending a helping hand at all.Huayun shuddered and continued pleading. \u201cBrother Chu, I apologize for what I said during the banquet. I beg you, please save me.\u201dHowever, Chu Kuangren did not bother answering him.\u201cMy dear Princess Linglong, please, save me please.\u201d Seeing that Chu Kuangren did not care, Huayun shifted his gaze onto Princess Linglong.Princess Linglong was a bit hesitant. \u201cChu Kuangren, having another person with us meant another portion of strength, how about we\u2026\u201d\u201cShut it.\u201d Chu Kuangren glared at Princess Linglong with a cold gaze.That reply was like a choke on Princess Linglong\u2019s neck. She instantly stopped speaking.\u201cAnother portion of strength for another person added? What a joke, can a person like him even be considered strong? He\u2019ll only be a burden to us.\u201dChu Kuangren said with an indifferent tone.\u201cChu Kuangren! How can you be so cruel!\u201dHuayun knowing that there was no hope of getting help started to show resentment and anger in his eyes.\u201cJust because I insulted you a bit during the banquet, you now decide not to save me even when I\u2019m dying in need of help. Shame on you for being a Sky-pride, shame on you for being a human being!\u201cI curse you to end up in a similar fate, to die slowly in suffering worse than me now!\u201dHuayun continued to hiss and cursed.However, Chu Kuangren\u2019s gaze was unmoving and he kept on observing him.Huayun\u2019s cursing did not affect him in the slightest. Chu Kuangren just watched silently as his opponent was broken down gradually into nothingness.Princess Linglong, who stood beside him could not help but feel fearful.At that instant when Huayun was completely broken down and decomposed, a blood-colored light appeared and flew towards a certain direction.\u201cSomething is going on after all.\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s eyes lit up and went to follow that blood-colored light.Princess Linglong tagged along with him closely as well.She had only realized at that point why Chu Kuangren coldly watched Huayun get broken down alive and could not help but lament his courage and cautiousness.However, he was willing to watch a person die in front of him to confirm his suspicions.This man was cold-hearted.Chu Kuangren followed the blood-colored light and reached the depths of the gray mist.From afar they saw an altar with an elderly man on top of it. He was bound by chains and sealing tags with runes written all over them.The blood-colored light came to the altar and entered the old man\u2019s mouth.\u201cDelicious\u2026 So this is the taste of a Sky-pride.\u201dThe old man let out a delighted look on his face.When Princess Linglong arrived soon after, her pupils shrank when she saw what had happened. \u201cThis elderly man is consuming Sky-prides as his nourishment!\u201dChu Kuangren took out the Descendant Self sword and slowly walked towards the old man. At the same time, countless strings of runes swirled within his eyes, analyzing the old man\u2019s information.\u201cBlack Light Sage, one of the guardians of the Sacred Palace of Death, cultivation level \u2013 Great Sage peak, in a crippled state, under the suppression of a seal, cultivated Sage Techniques\u2026\u201dBecause his opponent was a Sage, Chu Kuangren\u2019s Eye of Revelation could only reveal a limited amount of information from him at his current cultivation level. He could not completely see-through his opponent like could with the others in the past.Despite that, he still gained a lot of useful information.For example, the Sacred Palace of Death.That was an unknown force to him. Chu Kuangren secretly noted it down.Bang, bang\u2026At that point, a few chains and sealing tags on top of the altar were broken off.\u201cAbsorbing the flesh and blood essence of numerous Sky-prides and using it to break through the seals. This Gluttonous Devouring Sage technique of yours is truly extraordinary.\u201dChu Kuangren calmly said.On the altar, the Black Light Sage squinted and asked. \u201cWho are you, little guy? I can\u2019t believe you know about my cultivation techniques and practices.\u201dBy the time he started speaking, Chu Kuangren dashed towards him and made a move.The Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique was immediately deployed!That domineering purple sword beam headed towards the Black Light Sage\u2019s head. However, his gaze became stern and let out a loud roar. Terrifying surges of Death Qi then oozed out from his mouth, brutally blocking the attack of the purple sword beam.\u201cHaha, what a decisive Sky-pride!\u201cFirst you speak of the school of cultivation that I am under and take the opportunity when I am distracted to send out an attack. If only you are a bit stronger or that I\u2019m a bit weaker, then perhaps this method could have worked. What a shame, what a shame.\u201dThe Black Light Sage grinned and had a look of admiration in his eyes.Chu Kuangren was silent and immediately deployed all three transformations of his Daoist Physique, and once again let out another attack with his Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique, intent on killing the Black Light Sage in one single move.However, a terrifying Sage Daoist Rhymes could be seen coming out and surrounding the Black Light Sage which formed into a veil of Qi. It blocked all of the incoming attacks!\u201cThis Sage truly is a Sage indeed. No matter if he\u2019s in a weakened state or sealed, he really is tough to kill.\u201d Chu Kuangren murmured.Although Princess Linglong, who stood aside him, did not fully understand the situation, she still sensed the terror of the old man on top of the altar. Her heart was overcome with fear and shock, as she did not expect that a Sage was sealed within the Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 57": "Chapter 57: The Godly Essence, Supreme Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall\u201cHuman Mountain Stamp!\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique!\u201dWithin the gray mist, horrifying noises continued to resound greatly.Chu Kuangren kept letting out one attack after another, intending to slay the Black Light Sage.Then again, when was a Sage ever killed that easily. The area surrounding the opponent\u2019s body had been condensed into a veil of Qi. No matter how hard Chu Kuangren tried, it was to no avail.On top of that, this was the power of the already weakened Sage.It could even be less than one ten-thousandth of his original strength!One could imagine how terrifyingly strong that Sage was during his prime.\u201cIt\u2019s no use little fellow, your power is still too weak to even touch me, let alone kill me!\u201cGo find a good place for yourself and wait for your impending death. You\u2019re a Supreme Daoist Physique wielder, so your flesh and body essence will be a great supplement to me!\u201dThe Black Light Sage stared at Chu Kuangren with a very strong desire.Like a hungry ghost witnessing a full house banquet of guests.Chu Kuangren stopped attacking and coldly said, \u201cIs it you who made the Luminous Moon Secret Realm reappear? Just to attract us Sky-prides here to be converted into food for you to regain your strength and break from this seal?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re correct, but it\u2019s too late knowing this now. Within this domain of mine, you won\u2019t be able to escape. You can\u2019t hope to kill me either.\u201dThe Black Light Sage grinned in delight.At that time, another blood-colored light came from somewhere far away and entered the body of the Black Light Sage. His momentum rose and his strength increased by a few portions.\u201cTsk tsk, the taste of the Sky-prides is delicious indeed. How wonderful!\u201d The Black Light Sage showed a very happy expression on his face.\u201cI have exhausted great amounts of time to add extra restrictions within this Luminous Moon Secret Realm, which only allows cultivators that are below Battle Monarch Realm to enter. This is a Sage\u2019s secret realm, and because of this the Sage orthodoxies would not let this opportunity slip by easily and let their respective Sky-prides enter, unknowingly sending them to their deaths as my nourishment.\u201cAt this moment, no one else can save you from this secret realm. When my strength recovers more, I will expand the range of my domain further. When the time comes, none of the Sky-prides in this realm will be able to escape! Haha\u2026\u201dThe Black Light Sage laughed and his eyes filled with delight, not even concerned that revealing his plan to others might lead to it failing.He had been planning this for such a long time, now everything has been going on smoothly. Even if he completely revealed his plans, who could ever hope to stop him!\u201cLuminous Moon Sage, that time when I kindly came to invite you to join the Sacred Temple, not only did you not appreciate my offer but you decided to instead suppress me. Good for me, although I\u2019m now sealed, you suffered major injuries instead and died by my hands!\u201cNow that I\u2019m close to completely breaking the seal, it\u2019s my victory in the end!\u201dThe Black Light Sage laughed in delight. That battle he had with the Luminous Moon Sage was going to come to a decisive end after ten thousand years!Chu Kuangren retracted his transformations, turned around, and left.\u201cYou\u2019re leaving, just like that?\u201d Princess Linglong confusedly asked.\u201cShould I not? Are we supposed to listen to him yapping away?\u201d Chu Kuangren replied coldly, not even turning his head around as he walked away.\u201cLeave? Where can you even go? Within my domain, what can you do aside from waiting for your impending deaths!\u201d Upon seeing the figure of both of them leaving, the Black Light Sage said in disdain.\u2026After leaving the sealed area, Chu Kuangren found a cave within the gray fog. He went into it and took out a large pile of treasures and items.Those were the ones he took from Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasury.Every item he took out was very priceless and valuable.\u201cWhat are you trying to do?\u201d Princess Linglong was confused.\u201cMeditate, break through, and kill the Sage!\u201dChu Kuangren replied coldly.However, he had a frustrating and panicked look in his eyes, which was rare even for him.Princess Linglong noticed he was panicking and said, \u201cEven if you were to meditate and cultivate more, you\u2019ll need days to increase your strength no matter how gifted you are. Even after those few days, everything that entered the gray mist will already be dead.\u201cThat Sage\u2019s strength will keep increasing gradually. Even if you manage to break through and reach the Paradise realm, can you even hope to defeat him?\u201dWhen Princess Linglong finished saying that, what came after was silence.She was correct.Chu Kuangren knew that what she said made sense.Adding to the fact that Lan Yu\u2019s conditions were now unknown, whether he could properly calm himself down to meditate and cultivate was also an unknown factor.\u201cI have another idea.\u201d Princess Linglong said suddenly.\u201cWhat idea?\u201d\u201cMy Godly Essence!\u201d\u201cCome again?\u201d Chu Kuangren was startled in disbelief.\u201cI\u2019ll give you the Godly Essence so that you can use its power to break through and increase your strength in a short period.\u201d Princess Linglong said calmly, as if she was not talking about something as important as her purity and innocence.\u201cAre you serious?\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s gaze became very stern.\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d Princess Linglong took a deep breath, as she slowly loosened her robes, revealing her smooth and white body.No one could deny that Princess Linglong was a very beautiful lady.Besides that, she also had an irresistible smoking hot figure.Chu Kuangren was in a daze momentarily as he looked at her, but turned and looked away soon after. \u201cI do not need methods like these to break through.\u201dPrincess Linglong who saw him in a daze for a short while just now could not help but feel a little excited.It appears that she was not unattractive to him after all.\u201cYou don\u2019t have any other choice.\u201d Princess Linglong slowly walked towards him and hugged him, exhaling beside his ears as she said that.Without waiting for Chu Kuangren to do anything, she took the initiative to undress him. She did not know that Chu Kuangren himself felt like he was taken advantage of by her.\u201cChu Kuangren, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re not ready to go?\u201dPrincess Linglong said upon noticing Chu Kuangren standing frozen in his place.\u201cYou forced me into this!\u201dAfter saying that, Chu Kuangren started to move as well.He flipped the script from becoming submissive and turned into the dominating party, pinning Princess Linglong onto the ground.For a while, the atmosphere within the cave was filled with passion and lust.Not long after, a series of mysterious Daoist patterns circulated and swirled between the two of them, forming into a white bundle of light that encroached upon them.Within the bundle of light that was shaking up and down, a moaning sound could be heard faintly resounding.\u2026Chu Kuangren could feel like he was surrounded within a hot spring, where surges upon surges of Daoist Rhymes rushed into his heart. An incomparably pure burst of energy entered his body, and exploded within his spiritual Meridian, completely sweeping through his limbs and bones!The Golden Core, Nascent Soul and Daoist foundations within his body were all beaming with delight.Great amounts of spiritual power gathered at his spiritual Meridian, gradually condensing and forming into nine purple pillars with large mysterious Daoist runes carved into them.With the nine spiritual pillars as the foundation, a gorgeous Daoist Palace started to take form!That was the Purple Palace Hall!The foundations of the Purple Palace Hall symbolized the Paradise Realm!While the nine spiritual pillars represented the Supreme Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall!Just when Chu Kuangren succeeded in cultivating the Supreme Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall, a terrible occurrence happened outside the domain.Daoist Rhymes reverberated through the heavens and skies as spiritual Qi surged violently. A purple light shone through the gray mist as a brilliant glorious Purple Palace appeared.The Black Light Sage, who was sealed, witnessed it the moment it happened, and his expression changed drastically. \u201cThe Supreme Daoist Foundation and the Supreme Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall!\u201dSupreme Daoist Foundations were very hard to cultivate, becoming more difficult the higher the Realm was!A Nine-Color Nascent Soul was already rare enough.Now there was a Supreme Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall, and only a handful of them had appeared in tens of thousands of years!\u201cWho is this? Who cultivated and condensed this level of foundation!\u201d\u201cCan it possibly be\u2026\u201dThe Black Light Sage instantly thought of Chu Kuangren.In the entire domain, Chu Kuangren was the only one who had a complete Nascent Soul Realm cultivation, and only he could manage to condense and cultivate this level of Supreme Daoist Foundation!\u201cYet breaking through to the Paradise Realm in such a short time, and even managing to cultivate the Supreme Purple Palace Hall, how is he able to do it!\u201dThe Black Light Sage\u2019s expression was terrifyingly grim.An unknown variable had appeared in his plans!\u201cSo what if you manage to create the Supreme Purple Palace Hall, it\u2019ll not be so easy to kill me, for I am a Sage!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58: Daoist Enlightenment, I\u2019m Going to Slay a Sage, Luminous Moon ReappearsAs the Supreme Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall formed, something strange happened around them.Daoist Rhymes spread and resounded in all directions.That surge of Daoist Rhymes could not even be isolated within the domain of the Black Light Sage, since he was in a weakened state.Bursts of Daoist Rhymes permeated the surroundings, spreading across the whole secret realm.Many Sky-prides had also noticed it.All of them looked towards the gray mist and only saw a faint purple light glowing and swirling from within, as a towering and somewhat illusory Daoist palace emerged.The Daoist palace was extremely gorgeous and contained nine spiritual pillars within.When the crowd saw that scene, they all thought of something.\u201cThat is \u2026 The Purple Palace?\u201d\u201cOne, two, three\u2026 D*mn, that\u2019s a total of nine spiritual pillars! That\u2019s the Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall! How is it possible that someone managed to cultivate and condense such a remarkable foundation!\u201d\u201cWho can that be? Who can even do something like that within the gray fog!\u201d\u201cHold up, rumors say that the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother single-handedly cultivated three great Supreme Daoist Foundations, could it be him that did it?\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s terrifying!\u201d\u2026On top of a certain mountain peak, Lei Ao stared at the gray mist with a solemn expression in his eyes. \u201cNinth Grade Purple Palace Hall, who can this be?\u201cDon\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s Chu Kuangren?\u201dWhen he thought of that, Lei Ao\u2019s heart sank.Chu Kuangren already gave him so much trouble before he ascended to Paradise Realm cultivation level. If he were to break through the Paradise Realm and further cultivated the Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall\u2026Lei Ao dared not think further\u2026Now he only hoped that the existence within the gray fog would be able to kill Chu Kuangren. If that were the case, he would have one less opponent to deal with.Somewhere else.Gu Changge stared intently at the gray fog.\u201cIt\u2019s him, it must be him!\u201cThere aren\u2019t many Nascent Soul cultivators that entered the secret realm and he is definitely the most remarkable of them all. If anyone can cultivate the Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall, it has to be him!\u201cAs if it\u2019s not enough that he consecutively cultivated the three great Supreme Daoist Foundations before me previously, now this guy went and cultivated the Supreme Purple Palace as well!\u201cOh, Heavens, how unfair you are!\u201dGu Changge had a feeling that the one who cultivated the Supreme Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall must be Chu Kuangren. The thought made him swell up in anger.Before that, his three great Supreme Foundation Levels were enough to suppress him.What about now?He would be nothing in his opponent\u2019s eyes then!\u2026\u201cHahaha, the Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall, it must be our Elder Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cBesides our Elder Senior Brother, who else has that kind of ability to achieve that!\u201dUnlike Lei Ao and Gu Changge, Nangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and the others were full of delight and excitement.\u201cSupreme Daoist Physique, Supreme Golden Jade, Supreme Nascent Soul, and now the Supreme Purple Palace! Our Elder Senior Brother is even mightier now!\u201d\u201cThere will be only one name that is known throughout this whole generation, and that is Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u2026Within the gray mist domain.Chu Kuangren used the Godly Essence to cultivate and condense the Supreme Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall, but that was not all that happened. Other than that, the effect of the Godly Essence made both him and Princess Linglong enter the state of Daoist enlightenment, where both of them simultaneously felt the mysterious and profound essence of the Dao.Everything that they had learned up until that point was completely readjusted and tweaked.Techniques like the Human Mountain Stamp, Heaven-Slaying Sword Wielding Technique, Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art were all thoroughly refined and improved throughout that state of enlightenment.Detecting any weaknesses, covering them up, and improving them to the next level!Especially the Heavenly Crepe-myrtle Sword Art, that Sage Technique was already refined by Chu Kuangren properly and had been elevated to the level of a Great Sage Technique.The sort of mysteriousness they experienced was unique beyond words.Not only that, both of their cultivation levels also improved rapidly.Paradise Realm \u2013 early stage, Paradise Realm \u2013 middle stage, Paradise Realm \u2013 late stage\u2026Right then, Chu Kuangren suddenly opened his eyes.Inside the cave, the white bundle of light shattered and Chu Kuangren stood up naked. He then took out a white robe and wore it.\u201cWait for me here, I\u2019m going to \u2026 Slay a Sage.\u201dChu Kuangren said calmly.Princess Linglong stretched and nodded embarrassingly.Whoosh\u2026Chu Kuangren disappeared into thin air and was already at the altar the next time he landed. A surge of terrifying Sword-based Daoist Rhymes immediately burst out!While the Black Light Sage guessed that Chu Kuangren would come to find him, he was not surprised but shockingly said, \u201cI can\u2019t believe you can break through the Paradise realm in such a short time, and cultivated the Supreme Purple Palace Hall\u2026\u201dBefore he finished speaking, he was interrupted by a sword beam that greeted him!A peerless offensive attack was let out in the form of a bright and stunning purple sword beam!The Black Light Sage opened his mouth and released large amounts of Qi of Death which gushed out.The two different forces collided together, the terrifying shockwaves that formed from it rumbled the entire domain violently. It was extremely shocking indeed.The Sky-prides who were dragged into the gray fog were all shocked.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me something\u2019s happening again right now.\u201dWithin the gray fog, a figure wearing gorgeous silver armor headed towards the source of the shockwaves. That person was Lan Yu.\u201cThe Ninth Grade Purple Palace Hall just now was definitely Master! Not good, I have to hurry to his side as soon as possible.\u201d Lan Yu thought.\u2026\u201cWhat a powerful sword beam. Having recently reached the Paradise realm, you can already output such strong levels of power. You really are extraordinary!\u201cDevouring you alone is better compared to eating tens of other Sky-prides!\u201dThe Black Light Sage greedily looked towards Chu Kuangren.On the other hand, Chu Kuangren had also noticed that his opponent\u2019s strength had increased a bit compared to before. Obviously, he had ingested a few Sky-prides during that time.There were more chains and sealing tags that were missing from the altar as well.\u201cI can\u2019t let this guy break loose from the seals!\u201d Chu Kuangren\u2019s gaze was stern and the three great transformations of his Supreme Daoist Physique were all activated at the same time.Sword of The Heavens, Nine Heaven Sword Prison, Green Lotus Sword Song. Those three transformations circled and swirled around Chu Kuangren. At that moment, Chu Kuangren\u2019s Sword-based Daoist Rhymes had already reached their peak!Not only that, the four Supreme Foundation Levels in his body all bloomed with a supreme heavenly light. The surface of his body all became crystal clear like a piece of golden jade.Sparkle, crackle\u2026Within his body, the spiritual power all surged forth like a crashing wave!Just then Chu Kuangren was about to draw his blade, a sense of surprise flashed across his eyes. However, he continued to swing the sacred sword as if nothing had happened.\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique!\u201dThe terrifying surges of purple-colored sword beams almost fully enveloped the whole sky and covered the sun!The sword beam locked onto the Black Light Sage. The Qi of Death which covered him up like a shield surrounding him now started to gain a few cracks.Boom, boom\u2026As the cracks started to grow, they eventually expanded and burst!The sword beam violently landed onto the body of his opponent. However, that old body suddenly burst out in bright blinding light, and actually blocked the sword beam!\u201cHaha, although my strength now is not even a fraction of what it was, my body as a Sage is still the real deal. It\u2019s made by concentrated and condensed Daoist patterns. Do you think that your blade can possibly hurt me?\u201dThe Black Light Sage let out great bouts of laughter, as he had no fear regarding his body.How could any ordinary cultivator hope to destroy the body of a Sage?\u201cI still have this sword here!\u201dChu Kuangren spoke indifferently as he held out another great blade and hurled it towards his opponent. The long blade pierced through the void like a meteor raging through the skies.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 The Full Moon Blade! No!\u201dThe Black Light Sage\u2019s pupils shrank and his expressions changed.As he moved to defend, Chu Kuangren was already one step ahead of him. His majestic Earth Qi emerged and turned into a sacred mountain which weighed upon his opponent!Under the suppression of the sacred mountain, the movement of the Black Light Sage was slowed down.The Full Moon blade radiated with a dazzling brightness. Suddenly, a figure in white clothing appeared. He had the look of a middle-aged man.The Black Light Sage saw that man as if he had seen a ghost. Feeling terrified, he yelled. \u201cThe Luminous Moon Sage! How is this possible!\u201dEverything happened right after within a flicker of light or a spark of lightning. The Luminous Moon Sage held the Full Moon Blade and slashed forth, his Sage Daoist Rhymes instantly erupted and tore apart the Black Light Sage\u2019s body, chopping his head right off!At that point, an illusory figure broke away from the corpse of the Black Light Sage and flew away towards the distance frantically.That was the spirit of the Sage, the Sage Spirit!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There\u2019s no exit here for you!\u201dChu Kuangren had already anticipated that the Sage spirit of the Black Light Sage would attempt to escape, so he activated his Nine Heaven Sword Prison which sealed the whole area off with twelve long Sword Qi pillars!Without the body of the Sage, the Sage\u2019s spirit could only be described as a sitting duck. In addition to that, because the Black Light Sage had spent a vast amount of spiritual power over the years to restore the secret realm and adding extra restrictions, his Sage spirit\u2019s condition had deteriorated to be worse than a cultivator\u2019s depleted cultivation base!Right then within the Nine Heaven Sword Prison, there was nowhere to run!\u201cNow die!!\u201dAlthough it would be a waste to not capture a Sage\u2019s spirit, Chu Kuangren did not care and swung his Descendant Self Sword. Horrifying beams of sword light enveloped the skies and locked onto the Sage\u2019s spirit!After a shrieking cry was heard\u2026 The Sage\u2019s spirit turned to ashes and disappeared!The Sage had fallen!Within an instant, the whole secret realm started to rumble.The gray mist also started to disperse and collapse as it lost its master.From the heavens and earth came a downpour of red-colored rain as all the living beasts, birds and other animals let out a sorrowful scream!A Sage had fallen, the skies were dyed red and all living creatures mourned in sadness!Outside the secret realm.The skies started rumbling and red-colored rain fell onto the land.The waters of the northern seas were turbulent while fierce winds started to blow violently. Every beast, no matter on land or in the sky that lacked intellect all started to let out sad cries and screams.That sudden occurrence shocked everyone.\u201cThis is something that happens when a Sage dies!\u201d\u201cWho is it? Who is it that has fallen?\u201d\u201cOh the heavens, it\u2019s been a long time since I saw these signs that a Sage has fallen. What is going on? How can a Sage die so suddenly?\u201d\u201cCan it be that one of the Sages has reached the end of their lives?\u201dThe faces of Elder Ruyan, the experienced cultivators of the Thunder Falcon tribe, and the Honorables from the other Sage orthodoxies had all changed greatly. Each of them contacted their respective orthodoxies to find out.After some inquiries were made, everyone was confused.None of them had received any bad news. If that was the case, then who caused that red-colored rain and the cries of all living beasts?\u201cCould it be that something happened inside the secret realm?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s impossible. According to the records, the Luminous Moon Sage passed away long ago. Unless there\u2019s a second Sage within the secret realm!\u201dEveryone in the crowd was dumbfounded.At the same time, inside the Luminous Moon secret realm.After the gray mist had collapsed, what everyone saw next was Chu Kuangren standing proudly in the air along with the Luminous Moon Sage who walked to his side while brandishing his blade.Some of the people within the crowd recognized the Luminous Moon Sage.\u201cHey, take a look, that\u2019s the Luminous Moon Sage. Isn\u2019t he already dead?\u201d\u201cWhat exactly is going on?\u201d\u201cThat blade in his hand is indeed the Full Moon Blade. It\u2019s the sacred weapon of the Luminous Moon Sage, but he already passed away tens of thousands of years ago.\u201d\u201cWhy is Chu Kuangren there as well?\u201dEveryone in the crowd was either surprised or confused at that time.However, Chu Kuangren glared at the Luminous Moon Sage with a cautious gaze and asked instead. \u201cMy elder, may I ask you to give me an explanation for all of this.\u201dJust now when he was battling the Black Light Sage, something abnormal happened with the Full Moon Blade within his Yin and Yang ring. He heard the voice of the Luminous Moon Sage which guided him to toss his blade towards the Black Light Sage, and also cautioned him to prevent the Sage\u2019s spirit from escaping.The Luminous Moon Sage calmly smiled. \u201cSky-pride of the future, fear me not and retract your caution, for I am already long dead, and there is no doubt about it.\u201cWhat is now standing before you is but a remnant essence of my spirit. There is no need for you to take action, for it will disappear by itself later. This remnant spirit essence of mine has been stored within the Full Moon Blade for many years, waiting for the opportunity of killing the Black Light Sage. Whatever has happened today is due to your efforts. I hereby thank you sincerely for your assistance.\u201dAfter speaking, the Luminous Moon Sage took a bow before Chu Kuangren.That very scene left everyone shocked in disbelief.A powerful Sage bowing to someone younger and less powerful than he was?Chu Kuangren did not move and calmly accepted that bow. After that he took a look at the corpse of the Black Light Sage and asked, \u201cThat dead body shall fall into my possession, I take it that my senior elder has no opinions about that?\u201dThe Luminous Moon Sage calmly smiled. \u201cWell of course, naturally so. Slaying the Black Light Sage was also due to your assistance as well. I killed the body and flesh while you killed the Sage\u2019s spirit. Of course, you have the right to deal with this corpse in any matter you prefer.\u201dRight at that moment, the other Sky-prides that rushed to the scene were all dumbfounded as they heard the recent exchange. Chu Kuangren joined forces with the Luminous Moon Sage to kill another Sage?Was that real or fake?Another Sky-pride gulped and said. \u201cRed rain is falling from the skies, and all living beasts are now wailing in sorrow. All the signs about the passing of a Sage are already there, so how can this be fake?\u201d\u201cHow can Chu Kuangren be so terrifyingly strong!\u201d\u201cDidn\u2019t he kill another Honorable Supreme before? How come he can already kill another Sage not long after now? What\u2019s he going to do next, proclaim himself Emperor?\u201d\u201cIn the world of great chaos, such a horrifying beast appears!\u201dThe crowd of Sky-prides was extremely shocked.Glancing towards the peerless figure in white robes, they could not bring out any intention to fight and battle with him at all.How could they?How could a firefly possibly compare with the brightness of a full moon?\u201cI\u2019m afraid that in this life of mine, it\u2019s impossible to surpass someone like him.\u201d Fangtian murmured with a bitter expression on his face.Lin Batian who was beside him also frustratingly sighed, \u201cLiving with someone like this in the same era really is \u2026 Sorrowful!\u201dThe crowd of Sky-prides was all lamenting the difference in strength.At that point, everyone had the same thought in their minds.What era of great chaos, it was all a pile of d*g sh*t!Wherever Chu Kuangren went, what chance would the others have battling against him? Even when it came to that, they could only battle against each other, while their main opponent was already leagues above them!\u2026\u201cI bid you farewell, Sky-pride of the future.\u201dThe remnant spirit of the Luminous Moon Sage started to disappear.\u201cTake care, my senior elder.\u201d Chu Kuangren slightly bowed.If not for him, he would not have been able to kill the Black Light Sage. That was why Chu Kuangren was very grateful from the bottom of his heart towards the Luminous Moon Sage.\u201cIt\u2019s only a shame that I\u2019m not able to personally witness this era of great battles!\u201dA sense of regret flashed by across the Luminous Moon Sage\u2019s eyes.Chu Kuangren was startled.How did he know that this was the era of great battles?Before Chu Kuangren could ask any further, the Luminous Moon Sage turned around towards the corpse of the Black Light Sage on top of the altar. He happily said, \u201cMy fellow Daoist, the Sage of Black Light. Although it has been tens of thousands of years, it seems that victory is mine at the end of this battle after all.\u201dThe sound of laughter gradually disappeared along with the remnant spirit essence.Chu Kuangren took the Full Moon Blade as there were still some Sage Daoist Rhymes left on it. Although the Sage Daoist Rhymes were not as strong as before, if he could properly comprehend it, then it would benefit even an Honorable cultivator tremendously not to mention himself.After all, that was the Dao of a Sage.Keeping away the blade, Chu Kuangren headed towards the altar and looked at the dead body of the Black Light Sage with a smile on his face.The Qi of a Sage, the Daoist Rhyme of a Sage, and the sacred weapons of the Sage were all rare priceless treasures, then there was the body of a recently dead Sage!Whether it was used to comprehend the Dao or to refine weapons, puppets, etc. That Sage carcass would be excellent material.The value of that corpse would be equivalent to at least ten sacred weapons!Chu Kuangren kept the dead body inside his Yin and Yang ring.\u201cMaster!\u201dA voice of surprise resounded from afar.Chu Kuangren turned around, looked, and saw Lan Yu flapping her wings and rushing towards him. A delighted look was on his face.\u201cLan Yu, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, Master. What about you Master, are you hurt?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m alright.\u201dAfter asking her, he learned that Lan Yu had encountered a few Black Death Beasts when she was dragged into the gray mist. However, despite seemingly being in a frightful situation, she was not in any danger in the end.\u201cOh, pardon me both of you.\u201dPrincess Linglong suddenly walked over to them.Upon seeing her, Chu Kuangren\u2019s face froze and his body became stiff. Lan Yu however frowned instead as she felt that this woman was behaving strangely in front of her.That tone she had just now, it seemed a bit \u2026 Sour?Or did she misread her?\u201cYou came.\u201dChu Kuangren took a deep breath and looked at her with a complicated gaze in his eyes.\u201cI\u2026\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to say anything. It was for us both to survive, and I was the one who initiated it just now.\u201d Princess Linglong calmly said.She had an open-minded look on that matter.\u201cThen again, no matter how you look at it, I was one of the reasons why you are able to kill the Sage. I demand to have the Full Moon Blade and half of the Sage corpse.\u201dPrincess Linglong further added.\u201cOf course.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded.He took out the Full Moon Blade and the Black Light Sage\u2019s corpse.Princess Linglong instead took the blade, intending to split the corpse equally in half. However, she realized that the body of that Sage was near indestructible. Frustrated, she could only take the head that was chopped down by the Luminous Moon Sage.Since the head of a person served as the hub of all six meridian points for the body and was also the location where the consciousness was held, it was equivalent in worth compared to the remaining parts of the corpse.\u201cFarewell.\u201d Princess Linglong took the items and left gracefully, leaving Chu Kuangren who stood in his place with a frown.Am I\u2026 Paying for the services that she offered with her body?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

She waited for him to explain after that.\u201cIt\u2019s nothing much, let\u2019s go find Nangong Huang and the others.\u201d\u201cUhh\u2026 Alright.\u201d Lan Yu nodded. Although she was a bit bothered, she would not prod further as Chu Kuangren did not feel like telling her.Both of them packed up and left.On top of a mountain peak somewhere.A group of Sky-prides was gathered together over there.The center of the location at which they gathered was Daoist grounds. At the center of the Daoist grounds sat a person in white robes. He had the complexion of a middle-aged man and his skin was as white as jade.The only thing was that there was no sign of life in that person.He was like a statue.If Chu Kuangren was here he would recognize that person as the Luminous Moon Sage!Accurately speaking, it was the corpse of the Luminous Moon Sage!The white-robed corpse was stained with blood. It seemed to have gone through a great battle and returned to that very place, laid down some sealing restrictions, and passed away in a sitting position.\u201cThe Luminous Moon Sage\u2019s body is still so well preserved although he has been dead for tens of thousands of years. Sages are indeed skilled and unpredictable!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know who it was that managed to kill the Luminous Moon Sage, but could it be that mysterious existence that lies within the depths of that gray fog?\u201d\u201cAlthough this Sage has passed away in this sitting position for tens of thousands of years, it has far fewer Daoist Rhymes emanating compared to when he just passed away. However, this body still contains Sage Qi, and if one makes good use out of it, it will benefit even someone who\u2019s already an Honorable cultivator.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201d\u201cThen again, let\u2019s undo the seals and talk later.\u201dAt the areas surrounding the Daoist grounds, there laid a layer of restriction seals.It was placed by the Sage himself. Originally, that seal was unbreakable even for an Honorable level cultivator, but due to the passing of time added with the corrosion of the Qi of Death, only a thin layer of restriction seals remained. This presented an opportunity for everyone in the crowd.\u201cSo, everyone, how\u2019s the discussion?\u201dAt that point, the Young Emperor Lei Ao spoke.Surrounding him, the White Lotus Maiden Sage, White Lotus Bachelor Sage, Gu Changge, Yuanhong of the Dharma Sect, and the other Sky-prides all looked at each other without saying a word.Lei Ao continued speaking, \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter, don\u2019t tell me you all are planning to just stare at this Sage body before you and leave empty-handed?\u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for my lack of strength to break through this sealing restriction, I wouldn\u2019t bother asking for you idiots to help out.\u201dThe White Lotus Maiden Sage\u2019s face turned grim. She coldly replied. \u201cLei Ao, don\u2019t you think that using that kind of attitude to ask us for help is a bit too much?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be mistaken, I\u2019m not asking for you people to help me, I\u2019m allowing you all to help me. Unless you don\u2019t want to get the Sage\u2019s corpse of course.\u201dLei Ao replied indifferently. He had confidence that no matter who chanced upon this Sage\u2019s body would not be unmoved by the sight of it even if it were an Honorable Cultivator.\u201cAfter getting rid of the restrictions, who gets to keep the Sage\u2019s body?\u201dThe White Lotus Maiden Sage finally asked the question that everyone was most concerned about.\u201cHeh, it will be up to each of your abilities then, of course!\u201d Lei Ao laughed.Everyone in the crowd had different looks on their faces when they heard this.When it came to that, it was no doubt that the strongest force to be reckoned with at that time will be the Young Emperor Lei Ao.If everyone were to rely on their skills, the one who had the upper hand would also be Lei Ao.\u201cAren\u2019t you all top-notch Sky-prides within your respective orthodoxies? How could you not have the courage to do this? It\u2019s no wonder none of you can defeat Chu Kuangren.\u201dLei Ao\u2019s tone was calm but indifferent.When he heard that, Gu Changge\u2019s face turned grim. \u201cAlright, we\u2019ll do just as you wish then. Once the seals are removed, it\u2019ll be to each of their own abilities!\u201dUpon hearing Chu Kuangren\u2019s name, the White Lotus Maiden Sage was unhappy as well. \u201cHmmph, I don\u2019t have any opinions on that as well.\u201dThe other remaining Sky-prides all agreed as well.Actually, all of them had unknowingly fallen victim to Lei Ao\u2019s provocation tactic.After all, the body of the Sage was right before them. They could not just leave empty-handed!Rather than sitting by the sidelines, they might as well gave it their all and try!\u201cVery well!\u201d Lei Ao laughed as he figured for himself that Chu Kuangren really was disliked by everyone. Just a mere mention of his name was enough to rile everyone up.Not far away, Nangong Huang and the others looked at each other.\u201cTsk, it\u2019s a shame that our Elder Senior Brother is not here now. Otherwise, would they even have a chance to get their hands on that Sage\u2019s corpse?\u201d\u201cAlthough our Elder Senior Brother is not here, he exists everywhere. Even Lei Ao has to mention our Elder Senior Brother\u2019s name when he intends to grab the Sage\u2019s corpse for himself.\u201dMurong Xuan shook his head, his heart filled with even more admiration for Chu Kuangren.\u201cShall we make a move later?\u201d\u201cWell of course, even if the Elder Senior Brother is not here, we can\u2019t let the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s name fall into the mud.\u201d Nangong Huang calmly said.They were the disciples of the Black Heaven Sect and were also top-notch Sky-prides as well.Besides truly acknowledging Chu Kuangren, other people and even top-tiered Sky-prides like Lei Ao dared not to challenge him.\u201cI shall attack first!\u201dLei Ao took the lead and leaped into the air. Overbearing Lightning-based Daoist Rhymes swirled around his whole body, which formed into a pair of Black Lightning wings!\u201cBlack Water Falling Thunder!\u201dThe violent black lightning shot towards the restriction seal!Within an instant, the White Lotus Maiden Sage, White Lotus Bachelor Sage, Gu Changge, Yuanhong, and the others also immediately followed and let out their attacks, demonstrating the different techniques from their orthodoxies.\u201cWhite rainbow Charge!\u201dThe White Lotus Maiden Sage and White Lotus Bachelor Sage both let out a palm attack which condensed into a form of shining white light, rushing towards the seal like a flying rainbow.That was a top-tiered Supreme Technique!\u201cConcurrent Worldly Flow!\u201d Yuanhong of the Dharma Sect gathered the spiritual qi in the skies and land instead and formed it into a horrifying surge of spiritual qi torrent which burst forth towards the seal.Gu Changge raised his hand and let out a punch as the roar of a dragon resounded in the skies!Each Sky-pride of the different orthodoxies all sent out their attacks one by one.Terrifying bursts of Daoist Rhymes spread shockwaves everywhere. When they hit the restriction seal on the Daoist grounds, an explosion that rocked the earth could be heard, causing the whole mountain terrain to rumble as well.Even the surrounding void was twisting and trembling.Something cracking could then be heard\u2026The simultaneous attacks from all the top-notch Sky-prides caused a few cracks to start appearing on the restriction seal which was full of Daoist runes. The cracks were also starting to get bigger as they spread further.Finally, in the end, that restriction seal which had stood the test of time for tens of thousands of years, while being constantly corroded by the Qi of Death eventually could not withstand the incoming blows. It broke and shattered on the spot!The force that was released upon the seal breaking caused many of the weaker Sky-prides to be flung around hundreds of feet away as they looked at the Daoist grounds in amazement.\u201cIt\u2019s time!\u201dNangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and the others instantly moved.The few of them rushed towards the Daoist grounds, trying to snatch the body of the Sage!\u201cYou dare go against me with just a few of you!\u201d Lei Ao sneered coldly as he flapped his Black Lightning wings. His figure turned into a bolt of lightning which dashed towards them. Lei Ao reached Nangong Huang and the others and followed on with another punch attack.The crackling of thunder and lightning boomed as a few of them were flung out of the battle by that punch.After that, Lei Ao reached out intending to grab the Sage\u2019s body.However, in that moment, multiple surges of Daoist Rhymes reverberated and locked onto Lei Ao. The White Lotus Maiden Sage, White Lotus Bachelor Sage, Gu Changge, and Yuanhong all immediately attacked Lei Ao at once!Facing the four of those top-notch Sky-prides as opponents, Lei Ao could not help but retract his grasps and use his spiritual energy to battle against them instead.\u201cHmmph, I guess you all know that you\u2019re no match for me one on one, so you have decided earlier on to band together and fight against me instead?\u201d Lei Ao flapped his wings as he fought against the four of them unyieldingly.\u201cWe\u2019ll defeat you first and split the Sage\u2019s corpse later among ourselves!\u201d Gu Changge coldly replied, and immediately urged his Sage technique Dragon Slaughter Fist towards him!\u201cHmph, even you who lost after a single slash by Chu Kuangren dares to fight against me.\u201d Lei Ao gathered his black lightning and made his opponent retreat with a single attack.The White Lotus Maiden Sage, White Lotus Bachelor Sage, and Yuanhong all sent out their techniques. While that was happening, Nangong Huang who was recently flung out rejoined the battle wielding a sacred sword!Lei Ao suddenly found himself facing five of them at once!Within an instant, Supreme Techniques, Sage Techniques, Daoist Physique transformations, and other techniques were all simultaneously let out from those Sky-prides.The whole Daoist grounds overflowed with a violent overbearing mix of Daoist Rhymes which intertwined and clashed against each other. The surrounding areas were continuously destroyed and ruptured as the void around that area trembled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 61": "Chapter 61: I Desire The Body Of A Saint, Even If I Must Break An ArmOn the Daoist grounds, chaos broke out amongst the sky-pride sages.Horrific and violent Daoist Rhymes swept across and flooded the grounds.\u201cD*mn it! There\u2019s no end to a fight like this!\u201d Lei Ao frowned as he repelled the White Lotus Maiden Sage with his fist.Just as the others were prepared to continue fighting, Lei Ao bellowed loudly.\u201cSTOP!\u201d\u201cOh? Is the ever so dignified Young Master afraid now?\u201d Nangong Huang laughed.\u201cHmph, fools. Continuing to fight like this is just a waste of time. Let\u2019s all take a step back. I shall take the Luminous Moon Sage\u2019s head and leave the rest to all of you,\u201d Lei Ao proclaimed.The White Lotus Maiden Sage looked at him, skeptical of his words.Lei Ao added coldly, \u201cThis is the most I\u2019m willing to concede. If you wish to continue the fight, don\u2019t think that you\u2019ll be getting a break any time soon!\u201d\u201cFine! In that case, I want the heart!\u201dGu Changge nodded. \u201cI want the bones and parts of its flesh and blood.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll take the rest of the Luminous Moon Sage\u2019s internal organs,\u201d the School of White Lotus\u2019s Bachelor Sage said monotonously.Nangong Huang frowned slightly. \u201cIsn\u2019t this too much? You\u2019ve all taken everything. What is the Black Heaven Sect supposed to take?\u201d\u201cHmph, it\u2019s because of our generosity that you get to have a portion of its flesh and blood, but you\u2019re trying to take advantage of it?\u201d the White Lotus Bachelor Sage responded curtly. He seemed dissatisfied with the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s people.The rest did not stop the argument, but Gu Changge spoke bluntly instead, \u201cThis is a decision that we\u2019ve all agreed on. Do you have any objections?\u201d\u201cWait, I\u2019ve changed my mind. Other than the head, I also want a portion of the flesh and blood that will be given to the Black Heaven Sect!\u201d Lei Ao suddenly proclaimed.Nangong Huang paled.Everyone was ganged up on Lei Ao earlier, but now the tables had turned; everyone was suddenly turning their backs against the Black Heaven Sect.Nangong Huang was painfully aware of the reason.\u201cYou\u2019re all cowards who dare not fight my masters face to face. Is this your way of restoring your pitiful dignity? By bullying us?\u201d\u201cHA! Your masters aren\u2019t even worthy of being our servants!\u201dAs if some of their inner thought bubbles had burst, their faces darkened.\u201cPresumptuous!\u201d Lei Ao bellowed and upon releasing a punch, the power of violent thunder surged.Nangong Huang tried to resist the blow by grabbing onto his sword but he was still blown away with fine electrical sparks pulsing within his body. It was a hard blow.\u201cNangong!\u201d Murong Xuan instantly rushed out in anger to strike back, but Nangong Huang stopped him.\u201cYou\u2019re not his opponent. Stand back!\u201d Nangong Huang said in a low voice.\u201cF*ck!\u201dMurong Xuan and a few others were so angry that their blood vessels were about to pop. However, they were also aware that fighting now would bring more harm than good.The remaining sky-prides of the sage orthodoxy looked at Murong Xuan and company mockingly.These few days, Chu Kuangren had been crushing them so badly that they could not catch a break, hence they were much more comfortable in this position.\u201cHa, did you think that all of you in the Black Heaven Sect were like Chu Kuangren? How funny.\u201d The White Lotus Bachelor Sage sneered as his lips curled up mockingly.The White Lotus Maiden Sage frowned beside him. \u201cSir Bachelor, your intolerance is too obvious. Do you hold a grudge against the Black Heaven Sect?\u201d\u201cNot at all. It just slightly rubs me the wrong way.\u201d\u201cIf Chu Kuangren rubs you the wrong way, you can go to him to settle the score. It\u2019s meaningless to bully his disciples here. It\u2019ll merely make you look like a coward.\u201dThe White Lotus Maiden Sage stated monotonously. In the School of White Lotus, Maiden Sages were a rank higher than Bachelor Sages. Although there could be multiple Bachelor Sages, there could only be one Maiden Sage.That was why when the Maiden Sage reprimanded the Bachelor Sage, his face went red with rage but dared not talk back to her. Instead, it just made him hate Chu Kuangren even more.\u201cAlright, now that the nuisance is out of the way, I\u2019ll be taking the sage\u2019s brain now.\u201d Lei Ao walked towards the corpse with a sword.The sky-prides could not help but sigh and shake their heads.\u201cYou live as a dignified sage, only to have your body cut up in pieces after your death. How pitiful.\u201d\u201cYeah\u2026 No matter how strong you were when you lived, you\u2019re nothing more than a corpse after you die.\u201d\u201cTo see the body of a sage is like a rare treasure for cultivators. We wouldn\u2019t miss it if we could help it.\u201dLei Ao approached the sage\u2019s corpse with a blade in hand, smirking. \u201cOh esteemed sage, do forgive me.\u201dHowever, his words did not match his actions as he cut the head off in one swift movement.There was no hesitation.Just as the body of the sage was about to be damaged, a purple sword ray entered the battlefield in a flash.The sword ray first struck Lei Ao\u2019s blade before it shattered it on the spot and Lei Ao was sent flying from the impact.\u201cThis sword ray\u2026 It\u2019s you!\u201d Recognizing it, Lei Ao turned to the source of the ray.The others followed suit but with various expressions.Gu Changge, the White Lotus Bachelor Sage, and Lei Ao had a dark expression on them while the White Lotus Maiden Sage was curious; though Nangong Huang and company were ecstatic.\u201cElder Senior Brother!!\u201dThe man was Chu Kuangren!Wearing a white robe, Chu Kuangren had black hair that stopped at his waist. He exuded an immortal-like presence and a Daoist Rhyme aura when he defeated Lei Ao with his sword ray.Everyone was stunned by his arrival, especially Lei Ao.He felt that Chu Kuangren had gotten stronger!\u201cTo be able to walk out of the Gray Mist alive, you must have more lives than a cat,\u201d Lei Ao said coldly.Chu Kuangren responded emotionlessly, \u201cWhy would I die when you\u2019re not dead yet, you b*stard? The Black Heaven Sect will be taking the sage\u2019s corpse.\u201d\u201cYou want it all?\u201d Lei Ao spat.\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cHilarious. Chu Kuangren, we could have given you a share now that you\u2019re here, but to take it all for yourself is sheer arrogance! All the sky-prides here are not just for show!\u201dThe White Lotus Bachelor Sage dashed forward and her momentum increased suddenly.Yuanhong and Gu Changge did not look happy either.\u201cHeh, didn\u2019t you say that I declared war on the world? If it\u2019s a war you want, war is what you shall get!\u201d Chu Kuangren refused to budge.The Luminous Moon Sage had killed the Black Light Sage with him, and for that, he was deeply grateful, so he was not going to sit by and watch other people destroy the Luminous Moon Sage\u2019s body.\u201cGreat! Fantastic! Let\u2019s see what you can do!\u201dThe White Lotus Bachelor Sage\u2019s rage burst forth with a manic laugh.The jealousy in his heart then motivated him to activate his spiritual power, and a powerful Daoist Rhyme emanated from his body before it blasted out from his palm.Then, a dash of white light burst out from the middle of his palm before it exploded into a burst of white rainbow!Remaining silent, Chu Kuangren drew his sword, and with that same purple sword ray, it suddenly sliced apart the power in his palm, which backlashed onto the White Lotus Bachelor Sage.An agonizing scream pierced the air followed by gushing blood that spilled everywhere.A limp arm was tossed into the air.\u201cYou can\u2019t even handle a small tap from my blade, but you want to \u2018see what I can do\u2019? Pathetic,\u201d Chu Kuangren said indifferently.The White Lotus Bachelor Sage clutched the wound where his arm once was and glared at Chu Kuangren. His eyes were filled with hate, but beyond that was layers of indescribable fear.To think that the difference in their power was so vast! A single slash was all it took!The White Lotus Maiden Sage walked over slowly and looked at Chu Kuangren. \u201cBrother Chu, perhaps this was a tad harsh.\u201d\u201cWell, he certainly spared no mercy when attempting to strike me. Besides, this is quite merciful of me since all I did was break an arm. Would Miss Maiden Sage also like to have a go?\u201d Chu Kuangren gazed at her coldly.The crowd had no doubts that once the White Lotus Maiden Sage raised her hand, what would await her was the cruelest sword ray they would ever see.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

She eyed him one last time before saying, \u201cWe\u2026 We shall retreat!\u201d\u201cMaiden!\u201d The White Lotus Bachelor Sage was unwilling to take this lying down.He had lost an arm thanks to Chu Kuangren, yet not only was the White Lotus Maiden Sage indifferent about it, but she wanted to forfeit the sage\u2019s corpse as well?How could he accept this?\u201cShut up.\u201d the White Lotus Maiden Sage let out a rare, soft cough.Chu Kuangren was simply too powerful.Even if a Maiden Sage like her struck back, it would change nothing. It was better to retreat to prevent any more losses.\u201cWise choice,\u201d Chu Kuangren said emotionlessly.\u201cTo give up without even trying isn\u2019t my style! No matter what, I\u2019m giving this a shot,\u201d proclaimed Yuanhong from the Dharma Sect.Trailed behind him were four followers from the Dharma Sect, thrusting their hands out.The four soon surrounded Chu Kuangren, with each specializing in a different technique. In an instant, four distinct Daoist Rhymes filled the battlefield.It was a powerful combination attack.\u201cDharma\u2019s Four Mystical Arts!\u201dThose that recognized it went wide-eyed with shock.The Dharma Sect was known for its variety of techniques since they dabbled in many of them, but only a few were well known.The \u2018Four Mystical Arts\u2019 was one of them.Four people would work together to channel the elements of earth, wind, water, and fire, creating a surge of power which was much greater than the four individually; it was very famous in the Firmament Star.\u201cEarth!\u201dThe word earth was cast and a mountain appeared in the sky.\u201cWind!\u201dThe raging winds blew in between the sky and the land.\u201cWater!\u201dThe sound of crashing waves in a vast ocean appeared from the void.\u201cFire!\u201dA horrifying flame burst forth and burned the skies.The four Dharma Sect Daoists channeled their techniques as four distinct Daoist Rhymes and combined them into a terrifyingly powerful force that headed straight for Chu Kuangren.However, Chu Kuangren stood there, unmoving and expressionless. It was as if the terrifying force that was directed at him was nothing more than a summer\u2019s breeze.\u201cChu Kuangren, eat this!\u201d\u201cNo one has ever come out unscathed after being hit by the Four Mystical Arts. You won\u2019t be an exception!\u201dWith that, the four Daoists let out their attack. The four elements had formed a torrent of colors that burst forth beautifully at that moment.\u201cFancy stuff.\u201d Chu Kuangren let out a humorless laugh.As he stepped on the ground lightly, a terrifying sword Qi burst out from his body like a tsunami.In the blink of an eye, the Four Mystical Arts shattered.Under the sword Qi\u2019s immense power, the four Dharma Sect\u2019s Daoists too were blown away like a broken kite.The rest of the sky-prides were dumbfounded by what they saw.They were not shocked by the fact that Chu Kuangren could break the Four Mystical Arts, but rather, he made it look so effortless!All he did was step on the ground!Was he mocking them?\u201cWhen did the Dharma Sect\u2019s Four Mystical Arts become so weak? This is a sage technique, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cIt is. It merges the four elements into one technique. It\u2019s closer to a Great Sage Technique if anything.\u201d\u201cThe Four Mystical Arts aren\u2019t weak. It\u2019s just that Chu Kuangren is too powerful. A handful of the Dharma Sect\u2019s Daoists was never a match for him.\u201d\u201cNo need for fancy moves, just his sword Qi alone is unbearably terrifying and lethal! Chu Kuangren is truly a scary one.\u201dYuanhong, who had not moved at all, suddenly exploded when he saw the Four Mystical Arts shatter. The horrifying Daoist Rhyme that had been brewing within him for the longest time burst forth at that moment.\u201cTranscendent Coalescence!\u201d Yuanhong roared, and the aura of heaven and earth surged into a torrent of brilliant colors.The coalescence seemed to be a result of multiple cultivated techniques as it was fused with various Daoist Rhymes. It was extremely powerful yet breathtaking.Standing at the side, Gu Changge fiercely made his move too. \u201cBrother Yuanhong, I shall assist!\u201dWith a punch, the phantom of a golden dragon emerged from his fist alongside his Daoist Rhyme and its roar echoed as it headed straight for Chu Kuangren.Transcendent Coalescence and Dragon Slaughter Fist were all mysterious Sage Techniques that were specifically for offensive attacks. Hence, the power that came from the two highly esteemed sky-prides made everyone tense up.Even Lei Ao was acting cautiously.\u201cHuman Mountain Stamp!\u201d Chu Kuangren stood still from where he was. He merely raised his hand to gather the spiritual energy before manifesting a terrifying mountain.When the three forces collided, they exploded into colorful, dazzling waves of energy.However, the force from the explosion sent Yuanhong and Gu Changge flying, with blood spitting out of their mouths before they landed on the floor.Chu Kuangren\u2019s white robe fluttered in the wind while he watched the colorful explosions. \u201cIt\u2019s like setting off fireworks.\u201dYuanhong and Gu Changge almost vomited blood again at his words.Fireworks?They had put all their power into that attack, yet barely scratched him. Not to mention how infuriating it was that he called it nothing more than a firework!Behind Chu Kuangren, even Nangong Huang and company\u2019s mouths twitched. Their Elder Senior Brother\u2019s words were shocking.No one was spared from his harsh words, not even the sky-prides.Still\u2026 it felt exhilarating!Nangong Huang and Murong Xuan felt nothing but joy as they watched the other sky-prides get tortured by Chu Kuangren.\u201cChu Kuangren!\u201d Gu Changge glared hatefully at him, unwilling to take this loss.Since Chu Kuangren defeated him in the Black Heaven Sect last time, he had been resting and recovering his Daoist\u2019s core. With great devotion to his cultivation and help from various treasures, he finally ascended to the Paradise Realm.He believed that this would close the gap between their abilities.To think that the gap only grew!Last time, he was struck down by Chu Kuangren in a single blow. This time, both he and another sky-pride on the same level were defeated instead!Beside him, Yuanhong\u2019s face filled with bitterness.Anyone would feel despair when faced with such a defeat.\u201cHow could this be?!\u201d\u201cThis was supposed to be a great battle. Stars like us should be shining bright! But why is he so much stronger than us?!\u201d The White Lotus Bachelor Sage was unwilling to accept such a result.Chu Kuangren glanced at him before simply saying, \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. Indeed, this is a great battle!\u201d\u201cThe only catch is that it\u2019s me against all of you!\u201dMany of the sky-prides trembled in shock.On the other hand, Nangong Huang and Murong Xuan looked like crazed worshippers.He waged war on all the sky-prides!He waged war against the world!Lei Ao was dumbfounded too.This b*stard was being so arrogant!He was crazier than a Young Emperor like him!Chu Kuangren had already locked his gaze onto Lei Ao by the time he regained his senses. \u201cYou\u2019re the b*stard that hurt my junior brothers, aren\u2019t you?\u201dHe took one look at Nangong Huang\u2019s injuries and knew that only Lei Ao\u2019s overbearing thunderclap Daoist Rhyme could have been responsible.\u201cYou want revenge?\u201d Lei Ao spat coldly. His solemn eyes stared ahead as his body pulsed alertly with electricity.\u201cVery much so. I also want to slice you up!\u201dChu Kuangren then made his move.With a wave of the Descendant Self Sword, the mighty sword ray burst forth, and Lei Ao was forced to focus and deal with it.The moment the Black Wings of Lightning scattered about, the Black Water Falling Thunder exploded.The sword ray and lightning collided.Immediately, everyone could see a silhouette shoot across the sky before it landed on a distant mountain, coughing blood.The battered and bruised body was Young Emperor Lei Ao.\u201cIs someone like you worthy of being a Young Emperor?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63: Why Did You Kick The Hornet\u2019s Nest For No Reason? Look, Lei Ao Is Dead!Is someone like you worthy of being a Young Emperor?\u201dChu Kuangren spoke in an even and calm tone, but his words mocked Lei Ao.Lei Ao was so infuriated that his eyes were bloodshot and his face red with rage. He was still a Young Emperor after all; such humiliation was intolerable!\u201cChu Kuangren, I\u2019m going to kill you!\u201d Lei Ao charged at Chu Kuangren, roaring in anger as black lighting engulfed his body.He moved as fast as lightning.At least, it seemed that way to the onlookers.The old Chu Kuangren would have thought that he was fast too, but in his eyes now, it was merely child\u2019s play.He had improved far too much.In addition to the root foundation from the purple palace hall, he also possessed the other three great root foundations and the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart. All these had caused him to excel beyond the world\u2019s standards.Hence when Lei Ao charged at him, Chu Kuangren had already locked onto his movements. Then, the earth shook and a mountain appeared.Lei Ao was, once again, sent flying.\u201cSuch terrifying power. It\u2019s unstoppable\u2026\u201d Although Lei Ao was stunned, he calmed himself slowly. Rushing in did him no favors.Black lightning engulfed his body as his silhouette jumped from place to place.\u201cChu Kuangren! Come, can you keep up with me? My lightning gives me great power and unparalleled speed! I can go as fast as the laws of the world allow it!\u201d\u201cYou pose no threat when you can\u2019t even hit me!\u201dLei Ao\u2019s gleeful voice rang out.At that, Gu Changge, the White Lotus Maiden Sage, and the others were slightly shocked.\u201cAt this speed, even my spiritual thoughts can\u2019t keep up!\u201d\u201cSo fast!\u201dLei Ao moved swiftly, aiming for one of Chu Kuangren\u2019s flaws. With a glint in his eyes, he sped up and swept behind Kuangren.A ball of violent lightning gathered in his fists, but before he could unleash it, a sword struck his face.It hit so hard that Lei Ao was knocked out of the sky and he spun a few dozen times in the air before he landed on the ground like a dead dog.\u201cYou seem quite pleased with all your bouncing around.\u201d Chu Kuangren looked down at Lei Ao on the floor like he was looking at an ant.No one could comprehend how much rage Lei Ao felt at the time.Three times.Chu Kuangren had sent him flying three whole times! Moreover, since he did it in front of everyone, it was as if his status as a Young Emperor meant nothing!In front of the other sky-prides, he was the Young Emperor, but to Chu Kuangren, his status meant nothing.Lei Ao lay on the floor as his whole body twitched continuously.Now, the black lightning on his body slowly was turning red, and an even more overwhelming Daoist Rhyme emerged.\u201cChu Kuangren! You\u2019re the first sky-pride to force my hand! Only your death can erase my shame!\u201dLei Ao stood up slowly as red lightning surrounded him, turning his hair red. This terrifying aura of his even forced Gu Changge and the other sky-prides to back away as Lei Ao\u2019s power level right now was close to an Honorable\u2019s!\u201cDaoist Physique Transformation, Thousand-fold Thunderclap!\u201d\u201cThundering Blood!\u201dThe clouds in the sky grew heavy as the thunder rumbled.Channeling the red lightning, Lei Ao charged at Chu Kuangren with the blessing of his transformation, in which its sheer power slightly distorted the time and space around him.\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique!\u201dChu Kuangren swung his sword and the purple sword ray shone.The sword ray\u2019s light covered the sky as if it could swallow it whole.Instantly, the red lightning was swallowed up too.With just one swing, Lei Ao cried out in agony, and immediately, his physical form returned to his true form as a Thunder Falcon.Streaks of blood that were left by the raging sword Qi could be seen on Lei Ao\u2019s body.The blood gushed out like it was raining blood.\u201cRetreat!\u201d No longer able to bring himself to fight back, a pair of wings burst out of Lei Ao, full of lightning. He then used one of his treasures to shatter the sword ray before he frantically tried to escape.\u201cRunning away? Not on my watch!\u201d\u201cNine Heaven Sword Prison!\u201dInstantly, twelve pillars that were made from condensed sword Qi appeared from the ground. There were sealing runes on them too!In his transformed state, Lei Ao\u2019s body was suddenly met with a powerful binding force. It felt as if he had been chained down by countless shackles!Not only that, but the time and space around him seemed distorted.\u201cImpossible! How can his vision be so powerful?! Wait, no! There\u2019s a spatial force within his vision!\u201d Lei Ao exclaimed in horror.An obvious sign of the Paradise Realm\u2019s cultivation was its initial contact with the spatial force. However, to use it required many years of training.Chu Kuangren had just reached Paradise Realm, so how was he able to use the spatial force? It even merged with Lei Ao\u2019s Daoist Physique Transformation!\u201cThis is the difference between you and me!\u201d Chu Kuangren said emotionlessly.Chu Kuangren had ascended to the Paradise Realm with the help of the Godly Essence before he then entered a state of Dao enlightenment. With his prior experience in the state of Dao enlightenment and the Primordial Purple Haze, his knowledge ran so, so deep.This also included the keys to cultivation in each Realm.Thus, when he stepped into the Paradise Realm, he already had perfect control of the spatial force.Merging into it was simple for him.\u201cChu Kuangren, what do you think you\u2019re doing?! If you kill me, the Thunder Falcon Tribe won\u2019t rest until you\u2019re dead!\u201d Lei Ao threatened.\u201cLet them come.\u201dChu Kuangren swung his sacred sword and the Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique reappeared.This time, there were no accidents.The sword Qi strangled Lei Ao and his body exploded in a cloud of blood.The world\u2019s Young Emperor had fallen!The White Lotus Maiden Sage, Bachelor Sage, Yuanhong, and the others looked at the white-clad figure; their hearts faltered, their minds shaken.A total of eight Young Emperors stood at the top of all the sky-prides. Many have tried to shake them from their positions, but it was useless.That was, until today, where one of the Young Emperors had fallen right in front of their eyes.\u201cChu Kuangren, Chu Kuangren\u2026\u201dMany whispered his name, lost for words.They knew that from this day forth, his name would become an unattainable goal for many young, aspiring sky-prides.Chu Kuangren walked back to the Daoist grounds and placed the Luminous Moon Sage\u2019s body into his Yin and Yang Ring. No one objected.No one had the right to object.\u201cLet\u2019s go,\u201d Chu Kuangren stated.The Black Heaven Sect then left.Coincidentally, just as Chu Kuangren and company left, Fangtian, Lin Batian, and a few other people who were trapped in the Gray Mist arrived at the Daoist grounds.\u201cHuh? Bachelor Sage? And the rest of you, what\u2019s happened to you?\u201dWhen Fangtian noticed the White Lotus Bachelor Sage\u2019s severed arm and the severely injured Yuanhong and Gu Changge, he was shocked.\u201cF*cking Chu Kuangren happened, that\u2019s what.\u201dThe White Lotus Bachelor Sage spat hatefully.Fangtian and Lin Batian looked at each other. Of course, it was Chu Kuangren. No one else could have severely injured these esteemed sky-prides on their own.\u201cI mean, why did you kick the hornet\u2019s nest for no reason? This man can slaughter sages!\u201d Fangtian said, exasperated.\u201cWhat?!\u201dThe crowd was originally prepared to leave, but they instantly turned around and rushed over with horrified expressions.\u201cThe red rain and screams of the spirits were very much the vision of a fallen sage! Did Chu Kuangren kill that sage???\u201d\u201cHurry! Tell us!\u201dThen, Fangtian and Lin Batian told them what had happened in the Gray Mist, and everyone felt a shudder of disbelief.He struck down a sage?To them, sages were like deities that were far above and beyond them.Yet somehow, Chu Kuangren had killed an Honorable sage!At that thought, some people screamed into the void as they could only express their grief this way. \u201cSince Chu Kuangren exists in this world, there\u2019s no fight for the throne anymore!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 64": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 64Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayOutside the Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon.The strongest sage orthodoxies were having a discussion. First, it was about the vision of a fallen sage, but now they were thinking about the secret realm and which sage orthodoxy\u2019s sky-pride could take charge and lead everyone.One of the most favored candidates was from the Thunder Falcon Tribe.\u201cMy tribe\u2019s Lei Ao is one of the world\u2019s eight Young Emperors. He is armed with fighting power and he could cross over to great realms for battle. In other words, he\u2019s as powerful as the King of War himself. Who else in the Secret Realm can beat him?\u201d1A well-known trait of the Young Emperor was the ability to cross between realms that were not small but large!The further the realm was, the harder it was to cross over. Only those that have fought the King of War in the Paradise Realm had the right to be called Young Emperor!Any sky-pride that entered the Secret Realm could fight the King of War, but Lei Ao had a power that rivaled him. It was a huge advantage.It was no wonder the Thunder Falcon Tribe was so pleased.If things went well, Lei Ao would profit the most from this.\u201cPerhaps the Thunder Falcon Tribe is too confident. The Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother certainly isn\u2019t inferior to Lei Ao,\u201d an Honorable sage spoke up.The sage was not exactly on good terms with Black Heaven Sect, but he just simply could not tolerate the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s arrogance.\u201cAh, Chu Kuangren? He looks like a lad with potential, but I hope he doesn\u2019t run into our Lei Ao or he\u2019ll die a horrible death.\u201dThe Honorable sage of the Thunder Falcon Tribe was extremely confident in Lei Ao.Elder Ruyan felt irritated at those words. \u201cHonorable Lei Huo, you believe that Lei Ao is invincible, don\u2019t you? But remember that if he runs into Kuangren, it isn\u2019t clear who will die, so I advise you to show some concern for Lei Ao.\u201d\u201cOh, then we shall wait and see.\u201dHonorable Lei Huo smiled with disdain, waiting to see a good show.However, his smile turned into a sudden frown as his Yin and Yang Ring pulsed. It was a communication compass.\u201cTribe communications, what is happening?\u201d\u201cHonorable Lei Huo! Lei Ao\u2019s life flames have been extinguished! What is happening?\u201d A low growl came from the communication compass. Without having to see the person\u2019s face, one could easily imagine the horrible expression on it.Life flames represent a cultivator\u2019s life, hence many sage orthodoxies take a drop of their disciples\u2019 blood to keep them burning to keep them in the orthodoxy.Once the flames went out, the cultivator\u2019s life would end.Many people at the scene had heard the voice from the compass.Instantly, everyone\u2019s faces twisted into various expressions.Some Honorable sages were even about to laugh out loud.Honorable Lei Huo\u2019s face paled. He was dumbfounded as to how Lei Ao could have died?\u201cMy lord, I- I don\u2019t know how it happened!\u201d\u201cThe Young Emperor is still in the Secret Realm!\u201d Honorable Lei Huo spluttered.\u201cThe Secret Realm? But he\u2019s dead!\u201dHonorable Lei Huo roared, \u201cStay there and figure out what happened! I want to know how Lei Ao died!\u201dHe was a Young Emperor!A Young Emperor with boundless opportunities! He was guaranteed to become an Emperor when he grew up, and if not, he would at least be a pillar for the sage orthodoxy!It did not even matter which orthodoxy it was!The light from the communication compass dimmed.However, Honorable Lei Huo was still rooted in his spot, unable to process what had happened, while the other Honorable sages looked at each other playfully.He was all proud and boastful earlier, saying that their Young Emperor was great, only for him to drop dead the next minute.Could this get any more dramatic?\u201cWho did this?!\u201dWhen Honorable Lei Huo regained his senses, his face darkened.\u2026At the same time, in the Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon.Chu Kuangren, Lan Yu, Nangong Huang, and the others explored the Secret Realm.The realm was huge despite being runned down; after all, it was a sage\u2019s home. So if one looked carefully, they might get lucky with elixirs, spirit mines, and more.Chu Kuangren even ran into Li Xingchen while he was fighting some Black Death Beasts. Luckily he had rushed over at that time because if not, Li Xingchen might not have lived.\u201cHow terrifying. To think the Secret Realm has such scary beasts. They\u2019re on the same level as the King of War!\u201d Li Xingchen felt some lingering fear.\u201cThey came from the Gray Mist.\u201dChu Kuangren stated.Trapped in the Gray Mist by the Black Light Sage, the Black Death Beasts survived by feeding on the Qi of death. However, now that the Black Light Sage was dead, the domain of the Gray Mist vanished and thus released the beasts.\u201cSenior Chu, the Secret Realm is simply too dangerous. Would I be allowed to stay with you?\u201d Li Xingchen smiled nervously.\u201cUp to you.\u201d Chu Kuangren had no opinion.The Secret Realm was huge and would likely take days to explore.\u201cStill, the Luminous Moon Sage lived alone. Why would he need such a big place all to himself?\u201d Li Xingchen muttered.Beside him, Chu Kuangren simply replied, \u201cSages are people too. People have different personalities. Some sages are content with a simple hut, while others prefer to live in luxurious palaces. There\u2019s nothing strange about it.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true. But this sage is indeed extraordinary. He has created such a vast area in his little realm. It\u2019s almost half the size of White Cloud City! Impressive,\u201d Li Xingchen said.\u201cVery much so.\u201dWith that, the small group of sky-prides chatted.Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren sat at the side with his eyes closed. He looked like he was resting, but he was doing his daily gacha rolls.\u201cTaishang Laojun, Jade Emperor, Tath\u0101gata, any God will do. Please bless my luck for this gacha. I\u2019m not asking for Legendary Starlight, but even some gold would be good?\u201dAlthough Chu Kuangren looked calm, he was very hopeful in his heart.Ever since he got the Heaven Spiritual Marrow, he never had gotten any gold again. Even silver was pitifully rare.\u201cDear host, congratulations! You have obtained the Magical Treasure Hunting Skill!\u201d\u201cF*CK YES!\u201dChu Kuangren stood up.It was a legendary skill!Lady luck was smiling on him today!The group was surprised to see Chu Kuangren with a gleeful face as they had never seen him so excited before.\u201cSenior Chu, is something the matter?\u201d they asked out of curiosity.\u201cAhem, it\u2019s nothing. A funny memory came to mind, that\u2019s all.\u201d Chu Kuangren suppressed his excitement.\u201cWhat is it, Senior Chu? Share it so that we can be happy too,\u201d Li Xingchen prodded curiously.\u201cIt was a joke I remembered. So, my wife called me to tell me my son was caught for setting a house on fire. I corrected her by saying, Arson.\u201d1Chu Kuangren laughed.Nangong Huang, Li Xingchen, and the others looked at each other.Was it funny?Or did they not have the same sense of humor?\u201cHaha! It\u2019s so good, I can\u2019t stop laughing! You know, our son, arson? Haha!\u201d Chu Kuangren suddenly burst into laughter.The rest suddenly caught on.Their Elder Senior Brother was telling a joke, and not laughing was disrespecting him!Laugh! They had to laugh!\u201cHahaha! That was a good one!\u201d\u201cAmazing, as expected of our Elder Senior Brother! It\u2019s the funniest one I\u2019ve ever heard! I could laugh for a whole year. Hahaha!\u201d\u201cSenior Chu, you\u2019re killing my sides!\u201dChu Kuangren watched them laugh until their stomachs cramped. He was slightly stunned. Was it that funny?He looked to Lan Yu who stood to the side. When she noticed his gaze, she forced a smile. \u201cHehe.\u201dShe was a terrible actor, but if your master told a joke, you must laugh even if it killed you.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 65": "Chapter 65: Who Objects And Who Agrees? Loot The Secret Realm Like Crazy!The group burst out laughing.Chu Kuangren shook his head in exasperation before sitting back down. Images of the newly obtained legendary skill continuously appeared in his head like a notification.Treasure Locating Skill \u2014 as the name states, it was a powerful skill used to find treasures. However, the range of detection depends on the user\u2019s cultivation level.\u201cThis skill came at the perfect time.\u201dA grin appeared on Chu Kuangren\u2019s face.As he thought about it, he worked the Treasure Locating Skill before information started pouring in from all directions.\u201cThere is an elixir 300 meters ahead, on the hillside.\u201d\u201cA spirit mine lies 400 meters northwest.\u201d\u201cThere are supreme weapons hidden in a cave 600 meters to the south.\u201d\u201cSome frozen Earth Spiritual Marrows lie 1300 meters to the south\u2026\u201dVarious information about the treasures flooded Chu Kuangren\u2019s mind. There were pictures to go with it.As expected of a legendary skill, its abilities were so powerful.Chu Kuangren felt like a walking treasure detector since he knew the location of every treasure.\u201cThis is amazing!\u201d Chu Kuangren was ecstatic.After a short break, Chu Kuangren could not wait to bring Lan Yu and the others to the nearest treasure.One was on the hillside where a ginseng-looking treasure was buried in the ground. Suddenly, a burst of light emerged from the elixir.It was the Light of Transmutation.The light was a sign that the elixir was evolving!The Light of Transmutation attracted quite a few cultivators.\u201cThis light has such a strong pulse. No doubt, this is a high-quality elixir. It might even be a legendary one!\u201d\u201cThis elixir will be of great use to me!\u201d\u201cHey, the elixir rightfully belongs to me!\u201dSoon, quite a few sky-prides were fighting over it. That was until someone else approached them.The lot stopped fighting the moment they saw the person who was approaching them. All they did was stare at the new arrival with solemn and fearful faces.\u201cIt\u2019s Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cWhy is he here?\u201dChu Kuangren ignored the group of people and made a beeline for the elixir. He dug it up and immediately placed it into his Yin and Yang Ring.Everyone was instantly pissed off.\u201cChu Kuangren, we found the elixir first. It\u2019s unfair that you just took it without asking.\u201dHe mulled it over. \u201cYou\u2019re not wrong. It was rather rude of me.\u201dHe looked at the group of people and continued, \u201cSo, let me ask. Who objects and who agrees with me taking the elixir?\u201d\u201cI object!\u201d a cultivator yelled.Just as the words left his mouth, a burst of sword Qi sent the man flying. He landed on the floor, coughing blood.The others felt a shiver crawl up their spine at the sight of the man.\u201cWho objects, and who agrees?\u201dChu Kuangren asked again, glaring at the remaining men.\u201cI agree\u2026\u201d\u201cI agree too\u2026\u201dThe few of them internally screamed at how shameless this was.How did he expect them to object?Did they even have the option at all?!F*ck!Chu Kuangren nodded in satisfaction. \u201cGood. See, negotiations are a good thing. If there are any other opinions, feel free to speak. If there\u2019s nothing else, I shall be off.\u201dHe then brought Lan Yu and his group to the next treasure site.This left the remaining sky-prides behind with nothing but conflicted emotions.\u2026In the Secret Realm, several sky-prides were fighting over the Earth Spiritual Marrow.However, Chu Kuangren suddenly appeared and intervened, saying, \u201cI shall take the Earth Spiritual Marrow, who objects and who agrees?\u201dHow could a group of sky-prides like them have the right to object?Even an esteemed sky-pride like Yuanhong, who was in the group, could only keep quiet and grieve internally. It was depressing.\u2026\u201cThis treasure is mine now. Who objects and who agrees?\u201d\u201cI object!\u201dSmack!\u201cAnyone else want to object?\u201dThere was nothing but silence.\u201cGood.\u201dThe situation repeated over and over in various places of the Secret Realm, where Chu Kuangren and his group claimed every treasure like maniacs.One moment, people were willing to fight to the death for a treasure. The next, Chu Kuangren would appear and take it away.Everyone was baffled.The realm was so big, so how did he know where all the treasure was? He walked around as if the Secret Realm was like his backyard!Then again, there was nothing wrong with it.No one in the Secret Realm could go against Chu Kuangren now, so he could do anything he wanted to. Did that not make this his backyard?\u201cF*cking hell! Godd*mn Chu Kuangren is going around like he owns the place! We\u2019ve spent so much time looking for the supreme weapon and he took it just like that!\u201d\u201cHim asking who agrees and who objects is preposterous! Who dares to object? Everything is all about him.\u201d\u201cM-my Earth Spiritual Marrow\u2026\u201d\u201cThis trip to the Secret Realm is just upsetting.\u201d\u201cDear God may thunder strike him dead. Please smite this man.\u201d\u201cLet\u2019s just go. I\u2019m not staying here any longer.\u201d\u201cThis b*stard is so arrogant! Does he not fear offending everyone? He\u2019s too arrogant, even as the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother. This is too much.\u201d\u201cPlease, he dared to kill Lei Ao. What makes you think he will fear offending us? He declared war on the world the moment he came here. Now, he doesn\u2019t even mind offending us even more! Sigh, Kuangren is truly a mad man.\u201dEveryone in the Secret Realm grumbled and complained.Countless sky-prides felt so helpless being under Chu Kuangren.In the meantime, on a different road in the Secret Realm.Chu Kuangren and his group were on their way to the next treasure.Behind him, Murong Xuan, Nangong Huang, and the others gazed at his back zealously.They had been so excited these past few days.Every treasure went straight to them without them needing to lift a finger! After Chu Kuangren\u2019s battle, no one dared to defy him.The feeling of your superior dominating everyone was exhilarating!\u201cThe next treasure is\u2026 a legendary grade Supreme Elixir!\u201d Upon sensing the next treasure, Chu Kuangren fidgeted excitedly.Legendary Supreme Elixirs were very valuable to an Honorable cultivator. Cultivators below the level of an Honorable sage would kill to get it.Of course, for Chu Kuangren, it did not have much use.His abilities were already quite terrifying, so a legendary grade treasure like this would not make any difference.However, it could be a nice gift for his junior brothers and sisters.For the past few days, Chu Kuangren had been giving most of the treasures he found to Murong Xuan, Nangong Huang, or other people.It made them even more loyal to him.Soon, Chu Kuangren arrived at the area where the legendary Supreme Elixir was, but someone else was already there. He paid them no heed at first, but he was soon shocked when he noticed who it was.\u201cOh. It\u2019s him.\u201dChu Kuangren was surprised to see the blood robe-wearing cultivator.It was Yasha Tribe\u2019s Spirit Blood Child.It seemed like both of them were here for the legendary Supreme Elixir. Just as both their eyes met, their expressions turned to surprise.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to run into you here, Chu Kuangren.\u201d The Spirit Blood Child looked at him curiously.He had heard countless stories about him lately.Every story was unbelievable.\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to see you either.\u201d Chu Kuangren smiled blandly.He looked at the elixir that pulsed faintly with light. \u201cWell, here comes the question. I want this treasure. Do you object, or do you agree?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I object!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Very good, though I would\u2019ve killed him if you hadn\u2019t the ability to do so,\u201d the Spirit Blood Child replied coldly.\u201cDo you have a grudge with him now?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked.\u201cNope, but his title of Young Emperor is quite imposing and powerful. I think it\u2019s quite a nice title to have, so I intended to snatch it for myself. \u201dThe two of them chatted casually like old friends who were reunited after a long time.However, everyone in the crowd could feel the rise of a terrifying, overwhelming, and repressive aura that was emanating from the surrounding area. As two different yet invincible surges of Daoist Rhymes clashed violently against each other, both Chu Kuangren\u2019s and the Spirit Blood Child\u2019s auras started to increase rapidly.Boom!!The Spirit Blood Child went and made the first move!!The ground where he stood erupted before his figure disappeared from thin air. The next moment he appeared was in the air above Chu Kuangren.A palm with blood-colored irradiation was seen coming down from high above.Within an instant, Chu Kuangren had the vague vision of a blood-filled ocean.\u201cNot bad indeed for a Spirit Blood Daoist Physique.\u201d Chu Kuangren casually smiled. Then, the Descendant Self Sword appeared in his grasp before he let out a slash towards the skies.A purple sword beam instantly burst forth from the void!As the two different forces collided in mid-air, it set off an extremely violent airwave that struck against the void like a tide rippling outwards in all directions.Nangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and the others had to step back at least ten feet.\u201cSuch a strong force. Is this the power of the Spirit Blood Daoist Physique?\u201d\u201cThe clash between two Supreme Daoist Physique wielders is not something that an everyday person gets to witness. Hence, we must observe this battle properly.\u201dThe few of them stood at a location not far away as they watched the battle.Seeing that the palm attack was ineffective, the Spirit Blood Child distanced himself and stared at Chu Kuangren. \u201cHow did you know about the Spirit Blood Daoist Physique\u201d\u201cIsn\u2019t it obvious?\u201dChu Kuangren chuckled.With the Eye of Revelation, was there any information that he did not know about?However, the Spirit Blood Child did not expect Chu Kuangren to have such an ability. All he could assume was that Chu Kuangren had accidentally allowed his aura to leak out sometime or the other.If his opponent had vast amounts of knowledge, being able to recognize the Spirit Blood Daoist Physique was no big surprise.\u201cSince you already know, then I don\u2019t have to bother hiding it. Spirit Blood Daoist Physique, Blood Ocean Transformation, activate!\u201dIn an instant, large amounts of Daoist Rhymes surged forth behind the Spirit Blood Child and a magnificent image construct of a blood ocean appeared from the void.The tides of the vast blood ocean rolled violently.Blood Ocean Transformation!With the help provided by that Transformation, the Spirit Blood Child\u2019s strength skyrocketed.\u201cSword of The Heavens!\u201d Following suit, Chu Kuangren also activated his Daoist Physique Transformation.Lines of runes swirled above his head as the Sword of The Heavens materialized from the void.\u201cVery well, let us find out once and for all who\u2019s the strongest! Your Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart or my Spirit Blood Daoist Physique!\u201d the Spirit Blood Child roared while his hand grasped into the void, gathering great amounts of Daoist Rhymes.A large terrifying blood-colored palm was immediately blasted towards Chu Kuangren!That horrifying level of energy was so great that it rumbled the ground\u2019s surface.\u201cColossal Grand Blood Palm!\u201dFacing the incoming blood-colored palm which erupted through the void, Chu Kuangren\u2019s gaze slightly narrowed as he swung the Self Descendant Sword fiercely.The purple sword beam then shone through and covered the sky!Due to the two opposing forces and the two different types of Daoist Rhyme, which boomed and clashed against one another, the void and surrounding area shook and trembled.The surging currents from the blast were converted into immeasurable forces of impact!Under the force of that impact, the Blood Ocean Transformation behind the Spirit Blood Child started to fluctuate aggressively and he was blown hundreds of feet away!On the other hand, Chu Kuangren stood in place, unmoved, with his fluttering white robes and his swirling black hair. Holding the Descendant Self Sword, he looked like a dark fairy who had descended into the world that stood firmly in his place.\u201cHow can this be!\u201dThe Spirit Blood Child\u2019s pupils shrank as he uttered in disbelief.He was similarly a Supreme Daoist Physique wielder who had the same Paradise Realm cultivation level as him and had even cultivated the Sage Techniques. Even if his opponent was the Young Emperor Lei Ao, he still had the confidence to fight and defeat him!However, why was he pushed back after clashing just once with Chu Kuangren?His opponent was just too strong!\u201cBoth of us possess the Supreme Daoist Physique, yet why is there such a big difference?\u201d Puzzled, the Spirit Blood Child\u2019s expression changed.However, Chu Kuangren replied to him indifferently when he heard those words. \u201cYou did not lose in terms of Daoist Physiques, but to the person who has it instead! You lost to me, Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cNo, no, it\u2019s still too early to determine who\u2019s the winner!\u201d The Spirit Blood Child\u2019s expression turned grim as the spiritual power within him rose madly.A surge of Daoist Rhymes then soared into the air, materializing into a large blood-colored bridge that landed on the blood ocean behind the Spirit Blood Child.A sudden intent of death burst forth!\u201cDaoist Physique Transformation, Bridge of Dead Spirits!\u201d\u201cDo you think that\u2019s all I got? There\u2019s still more!\u201d\u201cSage Technique,\u00a0Great Yellow Springs1\u00a0Technique!\u201dThe Spirit Blood Child let out a light growl. After that, an incredible surge of Daoist Rhymes arose and materialized into a great muddy river which gushed forth with a terrifying impact.It was like the underworld\u2019s Yellow Springs in ancient legends!With the advantages provided by both Transformations, that attack from the Spirit Blood Child was strengthened to an incomparable level. The violent waves of the\u00a0Great Yellow Springs1\u00a0rumbled and gushed through the void. It had a killing intent that could not help but make people shudder.\u201cYou do indeed have the strength to kill Lei Ao.\u201dChu Kuangren glanced at the water that was pouring down from the Yellow Springs and laughed.Following that, the Descendant Self Sword in his hand deflected slightly. \u201cYet, it\u2019s a pity that you\u2019re still leagues away from being able to kill me.\u201d\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique!\u201dWith a single slash, a purple sword ray burst forth!The waters of the Yellow Springs were instantly split open in half by that single slash, and the separated waters violently charged towards the ground.However, once that unstoppable sword ray split open the Yellow Springs, it then landed on the Spirit Blood Child. A blood-colored light suddenly flashed by.The attack instantly sent the Spirit Blood Child flying while blood spurted wildly from his injuries. His two Transformations were consequently shattered and the horrifyingly strong Daoist Rhyme instantly dispersed.Having been heavily wounded from that single slash, the Spirit Blood Child had a horrified look on his face.He had mustered his full strength, yet he still could not take a single blow from his opponent!If not for the defensive items on him that dissipated most of the sword Qi, that single slash could have killed him!\u2018What kind of monstrous strength is this?\u2019\u201cRetreat!\u201dThe Spirit Blood Child dared not stay for long as he turned into a blood-colored light and rushed towards a distance somewhere. Right then, Chu Kuangren had intended to use his sword intent to block his opponent\u2019s escape.\u2018Since he already made a move, then I shall not hold anything back!\u2019Due to the fact that Chu Kuangren\u2019s opponent was a Supreme Daoist Physique wielder, he might bring him a lot of trouble if he were to grow in the future. So, killing the Spirit Blood Child on the spot seemed to be the right choice to make.However, just when the Nine Heaven Sword Prison Transformation could be fully deployed, a terrifyingly horrible surge of spiritual energy burst forth from the Spirit Blood Child\u2019s body. Daoist Rhymes could be seen emanating from the blood-colored cinnabar jewel on his forehead which was headed towards Chu Kuangren.The single blow was so terrifying that even he had to deal with it in caution.\u201cThis is probably an attack on the Honorable Realm\u2019s level.\u201d\u201cMust be something that elders of the Yasha tribe gave him.\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s gaze narrowed as he deployed all his three Daoist Physique Transformations. Charging the Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique until its limit, he then let out that attack towards that direction.In an instant, the skies and land around him rumbled while black-colored cracks started to appear in the void as if it was on the brink of shattering.Fortunately, the structure of the Luminous Moon Secret Realm was strong enough to absorb the blow, for it would start to crumble with that single attack.That kind of power was enough to kill all the sky-prides within the secret realm.\u201cHe escaped quite quickly, not bad.\u201dChu Kuangren chuckled.He did not regret letting his opponent escape. After all, if he was able to defeat him once, then naturally that opponent would forever be beneath his feet.\u201cThat Spirit Blood Child\u2019s strength is quite extraordinary. I can\u2019t believe he managed to withstand a few blows from Elder Senior Brother. He\u2019s truly a Supreme Daoist Physique wielder indeed.\u201d\u201cI agree, he\u2019s a bit stronger than that Lei Ao.\u201dNangong Huang and the others said.In their eyes, any sky-prides who could hold on and withstand a few attacks from Chu Kuangren were already on a level higher compared to Lei Ao.Who knew what the sky-prides around the world would think if they knew about what had happened.\u2018All our hard work spent cultivating and refining our techniques was just to withstand a few more blows?\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They did not loot all of the valuable treasures in the Secret Realm, but they did obtain at least seventy or eighty percent of the items there, which was already a scary feat in itself.After all, many sky-prides went into the Secret Realm. Besides the cultivators from the sage orthodoxies, there were also those from the sage tribes, which then brought the total to around one or two hundred people altogether. However, Chu Kuangren alone obtained (TN: the author used \u72ec\u6218, assumed to be a typo of \u72ec\u5360) eighty percent of the valuable treasures within that Secret Realm!That very fact was enough to shock most people.Adding to the fact that he looted everything in Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s treasury after just descending from the mountain, Chu Kuangren\u2019s net worth in terms of valuable treasures and priceless items would already exceed that of an Honorable Orthodoxy!\u201cWhat a pity. Although the treasures obtained are plenty, not a lot of them are useful to me. Besides, I can\u2019t even find the Luminous Moon Sage\u2019s inheritance. Woe is me indeed.\u201dChu Kuangren sighed.Perhaps the Luminous Moon Sage could not leave one in time as he was on the brink of death after battling the Black Light Sage.\u201cAlright, the treasure hunt is almost over. It\u2019s time we leave.\u201dChu Kuangren said.\u2026Outside the Secret Realm.A few elders and experienced cultivators anticipated that the current expedition within the Secret Realm should be ending soon, so one of the Honorable cultivators said, \u201cThere must be numerous Opportunities of Fortune within this Secret Realm. I guess most of them must surely return with some reward in hand.\u201d\u201cYeah, I agree.\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll just need to find out who dominated in terms of valuable items obtained.\u201dBeside them, Honorable Lei Huo was silent but had a grim expression on him. After all, this excursion into the Secret Realm came with a heavy cost to his sage tribe!The loss of a Young Emperor could never be made up for.\u201cI don\u2019t care. Your disciples better have nothing to do with the death of my tribe\u2019s Young Emperor. If not, my tribe will never let you off that easy!\u201dHonorable Lei Huo\u2019s chilling tone swept across the other Honorables in the crowd.However, everyone in the crowd seemed unbothered.Every Honorable Orthodoxy here was similar in strength and power, so nobody was afraid.\u201cSheesh, speaking in such a menacing way, who\u2019re you scaring huh?\u201d When she heard that, Elder Ruyan, who already could not see eye to eye with Honorable Lei Huo, could not help but ridicule him.Honorable Lei Huo glared at her. \u201cAmong the sky-prides that entered to explore the Secret Realm this time, only your Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Chu Kuangren seemed the most formidable besides my tribe\u2019s Young Emperor. If we\u2019re talking about anyone who can kill him, hmph, the most suspicious one will be Chu Kuangren.\u201d\u201cHmph, what a load of nonsense. Chu Kuangren is a humble and gentle disciple, who has never had any intention to harm others. Within the Secret Realm, Opportunities of Fortune naturally coexist with the numerous risks and dangers there. Who will have known then that perhaps your tribe\u2019s Lei Ao died because he accidentally activated some sort of restriction or trap mechanism.\u201dElder Ruyan said.The Honorables from the other orthodoxies suddenly had a weird look on their faces.\u2018Humble and gentle?\u2019\u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019\u2018Declaring war on everyone in the world, murdering the White Cloud\u2019s Honorable Swordsman, and killing everyone in the White Cloud city hall; how can Chu Kuangren ever appear to be a humble and gentle person after doing all that?\u2019Hiding within the void, the Seventh Forefather could not help but grin when he heard Elder Ruyan\u2019s words. \u2018That little guy, humble and gentle? Yeah right.\u2019Whoosh\u2026At that moment, someone came out from the Secret Realm.It was Fangtian from the Five Way\u2019s Sect.\u201cFangtian!\u201d Just when the Honorable cultivator from the Five Way\u2019s Sect went to welcome him back, someone else was already one step ahead of him. It was Honorable Lei Huo from the Thunder Falcon Tribe.Honorable Lei Huo asked coldly, \u201cWho killed my tribe\u2019s Young Emperor!\u201d\u201cHmph, you better don\u2019t step out of line, Honorable Lei Huo.\u201dThe unsatisfied Honorable cultivator from the Five Way\u2019s Sect cautioned.\u201cI\u2019m only asking him.\u201dBy then, everyone was already looking at Fangtian as they were also interested in that matter.\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026 Chu Kuangren!\u201d Fangtian did not bother hiding that fact.Honorable Lei Huo\u2019s expression turned very grim the moment those words came out. \u201cAlright, I see. It is indeed Chu Kuangren!\u201dElder Ruyan was a bit confused.She had just complimented Chu Kuangren\u2019s humble and gentle nature as an overall good person but of all things, that person had to go and slay a Young Emperor. She was a little caught off guard by the sudden news.\u201cWhat do you have to say for yourself, Black Heaven Sect!\u201dThe enraged Honorable Lei Huo glared at Elder Ruyan.\u201cThere must be a valid reason why our Kuangren would kill Lei Ao. Maybe it was because of your tribe\u2019s Lei Ao who kept provoking and challenging him?\u201dFollowing that, everyone looked back at Fangtian, allowing him to continue the story.Not letting a single fact loose, Fangtian gradually retold everything that happened in detail.\u201cThe sage\u2019s body. So they were fighting over the sage\u2019s corpse!\u201d\u201cTsk tsk tsk, if that\u2019s the case, that sage\u2019s body is now in the hands of Chu Kuangren. That guy really is a brutal one.\u201d\u201cSingle-handedly going against the world? He does live up to his name. (TN: Chu Kuangren\u2019s name \u695a\u72c2\u4eba can also be translated as Madman Chu, implying that Chu Kuangren is a madman indeed.)\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren is really \u2018humble and gentle\u2019 indeed, so humble that he now owns the sage\u2019s dead body, without even leaving or splitting it with the others.\u201dAt that point, Honorable Lei Huo was not the only one who looked grim.The other Honorables had a bad look on their faces too.Elder Ruyan then casually said, \u201cIt\u2019s only natural that the sage\u2019s body was obtained by someone skilled. The fact that our Kuangren can single-handedly get that body for himself is a sign that he possesses the skills and abilities to do so.\u201d\u201cRegarding the matter of killing Lei Ao, heh, injuries and deaths like his are inevitable when sky-prides fight. If he\u2019s dead, then so be it, we can only blame him for his inferior skills.\u201dThe meaning of her words was clear.\u2018Whatever my Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Chu Kuangren does, there\u2019s always a reason for it.\u2019\u2018What do you want to do?\u2019\u2018Go to war because of this?\u2019The great wars between sage orthodoxies were no joke. Once war broke out, there would be no guarantee that the ashes of all living beings involved would remain as the orthodoxies were relentless in their battles; they never gave up easily. Due to that, it was not impossible for even orthodoxies with inheritances that date back to tens of thousands of years to be wiped out overnight.\u201cNot\u2026 Not only that.\u201d Fangtian gritted his teeth and continued on, letting everyone know about Chu Kuangren and the others\u2019 looting spree within the Secret Realm.The more the crowd of Honorable cultivators listened, the more terrified and anxious they felt.Everyone stared at Elder Ruyan with enraged looks.\u201cYou people of the Black Heaven Sect have gone overboard!\u201d\u201cSince all the treasures of the Secret Realm were taken by you people, what else is left for us to take then? Do you think we all came here just to get nothing?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Chu Kuangren just give us an explanation!\u201d\u201cCan you Black Heaven Sect people live with the fact that a single person occupies most of the treasures from there?\u201dElder Ruyan was shocked.It was just too overwhelming.Upon hearing the barrage of questions from the crowd of Honorable cultivators, Elder Ruyan regained her composure and said calmly, \u201cThese valuables and treasures are obtained by Chu Kuangren with his own abilities. Of course, it\u2019s justified that skilled people get what they deserve using their own strength. Why should I give you all an explanation?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026\u201dThe crowd of Honorable cultivators was so enraged that they were speechless.\u201cAnd also.\u201dAt that point, Fangtian started to speak again.The crowd of Honorable cultivators immediately turned their gazes towards him.\u201cAnd what? What crazy thing did that Chu Kuangren do this time?\u201d\u201cHmph, that Chu Kuangren really is a skilled person.\u201dUnder the gaze of the Honorable cultivators, Fangtian took a deep breath and said, \u201cChu Kuangren, that guy\u2026 he\u2026 He killed a sage!\u201dThe surrounding area suddenly became quiet.That silence was so immense that even a pin drop could be heard.Just as Fangtian was surprised, wondering why no one was speaking, numerous surges of domineering aura landed on him and it almost stomped him into the ground.\u201cThe hell did you just say! Chu Kuangren killed a sage?\u201d\u201cHow can this be possible!\u201d\u201cBullshit, how can such a thing ever happen.\u201dEveryone could not believe what they heard.However, the moment they recalled the signs of a sage dying, everyone had already believed that fact. All they felt then was an incredible sense of disbelief.\u2018How can Chu Kuangren kill a sage!\u2019Even Elder Ruyan was taken aback by the news.\u201cFangtian, speak up now!\u201d the Five Way Sect\u2019s Honorable cultivator hurriedly said.After that, Fangtian proceeded to tell everyone about the incident that happened within the Gray Mist. Once they had all heard what he had to say, the crowd of Honorable cultivators felt that such a thing was too surreal.\u2018A young junior killing a sage?\u2019No matter how one listened, they would certainly think that Fangtian was spewing nonsense.Soon after, more people started to come out from the Secret Realm.Some of the Honorable cultivators went up to them and asked about Chu Kuangren. However, all the replies matched with what Fangtian had told them.\u201cDoes this guy want to rebel against the heavens now? Last time he killed an Honorable Swordsman, now he has slain a sage. Is this guy even human?\u201d\u201cEven if this is the Era of great battles, the existence of a person of such caliber is just too terrifying.\u201d\u201cWhat that person around, how could the other sky-prides ever hope to contend for a place in the Emperor Realm? Living with such a person in the same era truly is depressing!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They could only feel that it was all too absurd and unreal.Even Elder Ruyan herself thought that the news about Chu Kuangren was exaggerated.If an Honorable Realm cultivator had already felt as such, what about the others? The tens of thousands of cultivators that came to the Northern seas must all be shocked to their core by the news.\u201cChu Kuangren slaying a sage? By the Gods, is that true?\u201d\u201cEven the Honorables have admitted it.\u201d\u201cSince the signs of a sage dying had already appeared a while ago, how can this be fake? This Chu Kuangren is just too scary.\u201dAs the news was spread among the cultivators, one could only imagine that Chu Kuangren\u2019s name would once again cause a sensation in the world when they all returned to their respective domains.The Azure Dragon Domain aside, it would reckon that all four domains would be shocked by the news.Whoosh\u2026A stream of light appeared from the Secret Realm. Seeing that it was a young man in blood-colored robes, the Yasha Tribe\u2019s Honorable Ye Xue hurried towards him.\u201cSpirit Blood Child, are you alright?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m fine, just a small injury to deal with.\u201dThe Spirit Blood Child\u2019s expression was an unpleasant one as he spoke.\u201cWho did this to you?\u201d the Honorable Ye Xue asked seriously.\u201cChu Kuangren!\u201dHonorable Ye Xue\u2019s expression changed slightly, but he was not that shocked. \u201cWithin the entire Secret Realm, I guess he\u2019s the only one who\u2019s able to hurt you.\u201dHe also noticed that the cinnabar jewel on the Spirit Blood Child\u2019s forehead had disappeared.That was a failsafe he had provided to the Spirit Blood Child for use during life-threatening situations. \u2018I can\u2019t believe he had to resort to using this. This Chu Kuangren is a formidable person indeed.\u2019Just when almost everyone within the Secret Realm had come out, Elder Ruyan looked towards that place and wondered. \u201cWhy hasn\u2019t Kuangren and the others come out yet?\u201dAs she finished speaking, a few figures walked out of the Secret Realm.They were the disciples of the Black Heaven Sect, led by none other than Chu Kuangren himself.Numerous cultivators looked in their direction.Among them, some had a fiery passion in their gazes, some others had a look of yearning, while others looked terrified\u2026The moment Chu Kuangren stepped out of the Secret Realm, he could immediately feel multiple terrifying and domineering auras enveloping above and locking on to him!\u201cChu Kuangren, pay back my Young Emperor\u2019s life now!\u201dHonorable Lei Huo instantly made his move.As the domineering aura of that Honorable Realm cultivator erupted, it caused the surrounding area to rumble.\u201cOld man! You dare cause trouble!\u201dKnowing that Honorable Lei Huo would make a move, Elder Ruyan had prepared herself for that moment he did. Just when he took action, she immediately went and halted him.However, she alone could only stop Honorable Lei Huo and not the other Honorable Realm cultivators who were rushing towards Chu Kuangren.Elder Ruyan\u2019s expression changed. \u201cKuangren!\u201dDespite many Honorable Realm cultivators targeting him, Chu Kuangren stood his place unmoved. His expression was calm and indifferent, and not a single sign of panic could be found.\u201cHmph.\u201dA cold snort rang from within the void.Following that, multiple terrifying sword rays were seen erupting from the void and headed towards the Honorable Realm cultivators of the Thunder Falcon Tribe.\u201cWhat!\u201d\u201cNot good!\u201dEach sword ray locked onto every single one of the Honorable Realm cultivators. In the blink of an eye, multiple clusters of blood mists exploded in the air, killing the Honorable Realm cultivators simultaneously!That level of strength was extremely hard to achieve even for an Honorable Realm cultivator.\u201cIt\u2019s Chu Kuangren\u2019s protector. He\u2019s making his move now!\u201d\u201cThis level of power\u2026 Honorable Supreme! It\u2019s an Honorable Supreme! The Black Heaven Sect has assigned an Honorable Supreme as his protector! \u201dThe experienced cultivators from the present Orthodoxies were all shocked.An Honorable Supreme was an absolute powerhouse no matter in which orthodoxy. There were no more than twenty known Honorable Supremes in the Azure Dragon Domain, with most of them being the highest authority within either the Sage Orthodoxies or Sage Tribes.However, such a powerful existence had been secretly guarding Chu Kuangren!\u201cAnyone who dares touch him will die!\u201dThe voice of the Seventh Forefather resounded through the air.Elder Ruyan was delighted before she became a bit confused. \u2018This is definitely the Seventh Forefather\u2019s voice, but why does he sound so much younger?\u2019\u201cHonorable Supreme!\u201d Upon hearing that, Honorable Lei Huo stopped and his face was horribly grim from seeing the clusters of blood mists that exploded in the air just now.Not only did he lose a Young Emperor, but he now lost a few Honorables as well.This excursion into the Secret Realm had cost the Thunder Falcon Tribe greatly.\u201cMy Thunder Falcon Tribe shall remember this!\u201dAfter saying that, Honorable Lei Huo was going to leave.He could not do anything with an Honorable Supreme there anyway.\u201cOh, you still dare threaten me?\u201dThe Seventh Forefather\u2019s voice resounded again. Yet this time along with that, a ray of sword beam emanated terrifying surges of Daoist Rhymes that shot forth and locked on to Honorable Lei Huo.\u201cWhat!\u201d Honorable Lei Huo panicked and lost his composure. He then quickly tried to block the attack with his own as violent jolts of lightning, mixed with flames, blasted out from him.However, the difference between an Honorable and an Honorable Supreme was just too great. The indomitable sword ray tore through the lightning flames and ripped off one of Honorable Lei Huo\u2019s arms.\u201cMy arm\u2026\u201d The Honorable Lei Huo\u2019s expression soon went pale.\u201cI\u2019m letting you live so that you can return to inform your tribe\u2019s elders. Let the lads of a younger generation settle their matters among themselves. If you seek to cause any trouble, my Black Heaven Sect shall not hesitate to go to war with your orthodoxy!\u201dThe Seventh Forefather spoke in an extremely unforgiving tone.He was giving them a warning.A warning that was directed specifically towards the Thunder Falcon Tribe, and towards the other orthodoxies present as well. It was a show of the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s determination and grit.Chu Kuangren would no doubt be heavily guarded by them!\u2018Matters concerning the younger generation shall only be handled by the people of that generation themselves.\u2019\u2018If you the elder ones seek to bully the young lads, then the Black Heaven Sect shall fight until the very demise of their whole orthodoxy. We shall never let you off that easily!\u2019Indeed.A flicker of light flashed across the eyes of the Honorables from the other orthodoxies.Chu Kuangren was just too amazing.If allowed to mature and grow, he would definitely become a force to be reckoned with. The intent to prevent Chu Kuangren from growing more mature and powerful by killing him was indeed present within their minds.However, the actions of the Seventh Forefather made most of them give up on that notion.A war between orthodoxies was no joke.\u201cLet\u2019s leave!\u201dDespite having a severed arm, the Honorable Lei Huo had no intention to risk his life in a fight. Holding his severed arm, he disgracefully left the scene.Risking his life in a fight? What could he ever use to fight against an Honorable Supreme?\u201cAre you alright, Kuangren?\u201dElder Ruyan hurried towards him and asked.Nangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and the others secretly felt jealous beside him.\u2018Only caring about our Elder Senior Brother huh? How nice.\u2019\u201cI\u2019m alright. I apologize for making you and the elders worry.\u201dChu Kuangren chuckled. When he was not causing trouble, he did look somewhat humble and gentle talking to the people close to him.The more the experienced cultivators from the other orthodoxies looked, the more they felt that he was truly remarkable. They even increasingly felt that Chu Kuangren was indeed a living dragon among men, and at that, they could not help but sigh.Why did such a remarkable and talented person not appear within their orthodoxy?It was a pity, really such a pity indeed.\u201cElder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect, we have something to ask you.\u201dAt that time, an Honorable suddenly spoke.\u201cSure, of course, my senior. Please ask ahead.\u201d\u201cWas there indeed a sage living within the Secret Realm? Did you really kill him as well?\u201dThe crowd stared at Chu Kuangren with piercing gazes, waiting attentively for his reply.\u201cYes.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded slightly.Despite knowing the answer earlier, everyone in the crowd could not help but feel shocked when they heard it personally from Chu Kuangren himself.\u201cWhat was actually going on in there? Can you elaborate on that please?\u201dThey did not believe that Chu Kuangren could single-handedly kill a sage.There must be some hidden reason for all of that to happen.\u201cGladly.\u201dSeeing that it was not something shameful to talk about, Chu Kuangren told everyone about the Black Light Sage that was sealed within the Secret Realm, who nurtured the Black Death Beasts and consumed sky-prides as his nourishment.When he reached the part where he killed the Black Light Sage, Chu Kuangren only mentioned that it was because of his fortunate breakthrough that he could ascend to the Paradise Realm cultivation level in time. Moreover, it was only with the help of the Luminous Moon Sage\u2019s remnant spirit that he managed to succeed. During this part, he did not even mention anything about Princess Linglong.Towards the direction of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s camp and in her horse-drawn carriage, Princess Linglong was listening to Chu Kuangren\u2019s recollection of the events that transpired. Upon hearing what he said, she grinned. \u201cI wonder, is this his way of preserving my image? Heh, it seems you do have some ounce of conscience after all.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Serves him right for being sealed away by the Luminous Moon Sage for tens of thousands of years.\u201dAfter the experienced cultivators from different orthodoxies heard that, they all felt some sense of resentment and anger.At the same time, they could all understand how Chu Kuangren was able to kill a sage. Besides the weakened Black Light Sage, the Luminous Moon Sage provided him as well.Although the facts were shocking nonetheless, everyone was able to accept it now.\u201cDoes anyone here still have any dissatisfactions? If not for Kuangren here, your sky-prides would have all become food for someone else.\u201d Elder Ruyan\u2019s cold gaze swept across everyone in the crowd as she spoke in an impartial tone.The people in the crowd looked at each other. It seemed like they had nothing much to say about that now.\u201cLil Chu\u2019s talents are indeed extraordinary. Regarding this, I have nothing else to say anymore.\u201d\u201cSigh, all of this must\u2019ve happened because of fate.\u201dWhat more could they still say?Most of the valuable items and treasures within the Secret Realm may have all gone into Chu Kuangren\u2019s hands, but he was the one who killed the Black Light Sage and saved the lives of numerous sky-prides after all.Besides that, he explored the Secret Realm and obtained those items using his own skills and abilities. Even if they could not accept what he did, the fact that it had already happened could not be changed.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d Elder Ruyan frowned.\u201cWe have decided not to pursue this matter anymore. Elder Ruyan, is there still anything that you\u2019re unsatisfied about?\u201dElder Ruyan snorted. \u201cAll of you never even had the right to pursue this matter in the first place. However, Kuangren did save so many sky-prides in the Secret Realm. Does not mean anything to you guys? Don\u2019t you have anything to give in return for his great act of kindness? \u201d\u201cThis\u2026\u201d Everyone in the crowd stuttered as they looked at each other.\u2018How nice. As if taking more than half of the treasures in the Luminous Moon Secret Realm is not enough, now you\u2019re expecting something in return as well?\u2019Fangtian, Yuanhong, and the other sky-prides were dumbfounded.\u2018What the h*ll is going on now?\u2019Having been crushed miserably by Chu Kuangren in the Secret Realm, not only could they not pursue the matter further, but they had to thank him now instead?Was there anything more ridiculous in this world than this?\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? Don\u2019t you know how to be grateful for the one who saved you? This is such an undignified behavior from all of you sage orthodoxies and Sage Tribes. Oh, what a joke you guys will become when word starts to spread about this.\u201dWithin the void, the Seventh Forefather\u2019s voice resounded.The expressions on the Honorables faces changed. An Honorable Supreme had spoken; if they still did not act accordingly, it might not be so easy for them to just leave afterward.One of the Honorables from the Thunder Temple walked to Chu Kuangren. He held his palms together in front of Chu Kuangren and smiled. \u201cChu the Benefactor, I thank you for your acts of kindness and generosity of saving the sky-prides of my temple.\u201dAfter he bowed, he then said, \u201cIf you happen to visit the Thunder Temple in the future, everyone shall welcome you with open arms.\u201d\u201cThank you for the kind and polite gesture, Great Master.\u201d Chu Kuangren smiled calmly.Seeing that Thunder Temple had taken action first, the other Honorables knew that it was better to stop hesitating. So, one by one, they all went before Chu Kuangren and thanked him.\u201cThank you Junior Chu, the gate of my Five Ways Sect will forever be open to you. You shall be welcome to visit us anytime as you wish.\u201d\u201cThe same goes for Dharmas Sect.\u201dThe crowd of Honorables had no choice but to put away their resentment and thank Chu Kuangren. Some of them did it voluntarily, while some did it despite the dissatisfaction in their hearts.The latter ones were especially the Honorables from the White Lotus School and the Yasha Tribe\u2019s Honorable Ye Xue. It was an awkward exchange as they thanked Chu Kuangren, given what he did to their disciples.The White Lotus Bachelor Sage\u2019s arm was severed while the Spirit Blood Child was heavily injured. Given all that, they still had to thank Chu Kuangren, the culprit who did all this?It would be weird for them to thank him willingly.The tens of thousands of cultivators at the North Seas were silent.They were all dumbfounded as they watched the Honorables lining up one by one to thank and bow to a junior cultivator.That scene was too much of a fantasy even for them.\u201cAlright, I presume we can leave now?\u201d one of the Honorables spoke. The person he was asking was not Elder Ruyan, but the Seventh Forefather instead.\u201cLeave,\u201d the Seventh Forefather replied.\u2018We\u2019re all sage orthodoxies anyway. There\u2019s no point pushing things too far.\u2019The crowd of sky-prides and orthodoxies was initially filled with hopes and expectations when they arrived, but all of them returned with disappointment instead. The only party who reaped the most rewards was the Black Heaven\u2019s Sect.After leaving the Northern seas, the group from the Black Heaven\u2019s Sect found a secluded place to gather and rest. As everyone gathered together, Elder Ruyan specifically asked Chu Kuangren about what he had experienced, having traveled out adventuring and training all those days.Without concealing anything, Chu Kuangren told her everything that happened.Finally, at last, even the Seventh Forefather appeared before everyone.Seeing him return to his prime state, Elder Ruyan was astounded. \u201cSeventh Forefather, you\u2026 You\u2026 How can this be possible?\u201dNo wonder she thought that the Seventh Forefather\u2019s voice sounded younger just now.It was true. She did not mishear after all!\u201cHah, I have this little guy to thank after all.\u201d The Seventh Forefather then told her about the time he consumed the Life Extension Pill.Elder Ruyan was astonished at first but soon became very delighted. \u201cSo that\u2019s how it is. This is great news, our Black Heaven Sect now has another Honorable Supreme in its ranks! Kuangren, you really are the lucky star of the Black Heaven Sect!\u201dChu Kuangren simply smiled.Everyone then continued to chat for a long time before Elder Ruyan led Nangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and the others back to Black Heaven Sect.Before they left, Chu Kuangren handed over most of the items and treasures he had obtained from Honorable Yuan Ling\u2019s Treasury and the Luminous Moon Secret Realm to Elder Ruyan for her to bring back.All of those items were useless to him.The corpse of the Luminous Moon Sage was among them.\u201cElder Ruyan, I have a selfish request that I hope you\u2019d consider. The Luminous Moon Sage was someone who fought side by side with me to defeat the Black Light Sage and because of that, I have considered him to be my comrade-in-arms. Although the Sage Daoist Rhyme in his body is still useful to be absorbed and used, I request that you do not destroy it.\u201d\u201cI respect your intentions Kuangren. Don\u2019t you worry, we\u2019ll deal with the sage\u2019s body properly while considering your requests?\u201d\u201cMm, alright.\u201d\u2026\u201cMaster, where shall we head to next?\u201d\u201cBack to the Royal Capital City, of course. The competition for marriage still hasn\u2019t ended yet you know.\u201d Not waiting for Chu Kuangren to speak, Li Xingchen immediately replied.\u2018The competition for marriage huh\u2026\u2019Thinking of that, Chu Kuangren could not help but think about Princess Linglong.\u2018Ill fates, oh, ill fates indeed.\u2019Frankly speaking, if he did not have an affair with Princess Linglong, it did not matter to him how she wanted to continue with the marriage competition, or whom she would marry in the end.However, he felt a little uncomfortable now instead.\u2018Sighs, is this the so-called possessive nature of men?\u2019Chu Kuangren lamented.\u201cLet\u2019s go, we\u2019ll return to the Capital City first,\u201d Chu Kuangren said. After all, keeping this matter was not a solution, but there would be an end to this eventually.Royal Azure Dynasty, Capital City.After a few days, the numerous sky-prides who went to the Luminous Moon Secret Realm had all returned to the Capital City with the intention to carry on their participation in the marriage competition.Capital City, inside one of the restaurants.The sky-prides of each different orthodoxies had gathered there, and they were all chatting and exchanging information about the findings and happenings during their exploration in the Secret Realm. They soon found out that only a few people did not return empty-handed.\u201cIt\u2019s all Chu Kuangren\u2019s fault. That guy\u2019s just too much. I can\u2019t believe he got more than half of all the treasures within the Secret Realm,\u201d one of the dissatisfied sky-prides said.At the mention of Chu Kuangren, the crowd suddenly became silent.Chu Kuangren\u2019s name was like a large mountain weighing upon their chests, making everyone feel breathless and overwhelmed.It was just too hard.Living in the same era with a person like that was just too hard.\u201cThis person is truly a peerless talent.\u201dThe Five Way Sect\u2019s Fangtian lamented. Although he was unwilling to accept, everyone there did not doubt Chu Kuangren\u2019s brilliance.\u201cHe\u2019s indeed remarkable, but are we going to continue letting that guy outshine us?\u201d asked Lin Batian from the Zhiyang Valley.\u201cAlright, alright. Let\u2019s talk about something else.\u201dSensing that the atmosphere was a little tense, the Dharmas Sect\u2019s Fangtian went and changed the topic. \u201cWho do you all think will win this marriage competition?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

This refreshed the memories in their minds.Even they did not dare proclaim to be able to block Chu Kuangren\u2019s sword attack, but Princess Linglong managed to do it by herself. It was an obvious sign that she was a top-notch sky-pride as well.\u201cThe Princess possesses the Godly Daoist Physique too. If I can get my hands on that Godly Essence, then perhaps I\u2019ll stand a chance to face off against Chu Kuangren.\u201dAt that time, one of the sky-prides murmured.The eyes of everyone present lit up as those words were true. Although they returned empty-handed from the Secret Realm exploration, the Godly Essence was still an Opportunity of Fortune that they could obtain.\u201cJust give up. With Chu Kuangren around, do all of you think there\u2019s any hope of us winning this competition for marriage?\u201d one of the sky-prides then said. His words were like a basin of ice-cold water, putting out the fiery passion in everyone\u2019s heart in an instant.The bitter Yuanhong replied with a forced smile, \u201cChu Kuangren\u2019s abilities are just too powerful for us to handle. If he joins the competition for marriage, there will definitely be no hope for us then. Besides, the Princess adores that guy\u2019s looks.\u201dAt that thought, everyone in the crowd instantly felt a world of darkness looming before them.Such a handsome look and horrifyingly strong abilities to match.If they were the Princess herself, they would no doubt choose Chu Kuangren as well.\u201cEveryone, do not be discouraged as such. That Chu Kuangren won\u2019t be participating in this competition for marriage.\u201dRight then, Gu Changge and a few sky-prides could be seen walking towards the crowd.Everyone in the crowd frowned when they saw him. Previously, to cultivate his Heart of Invincibility, Gu Changge had sought their respective orthodoxies out for battle and because of that, he still held some grudges with some of the people in the crowd.However, they became interested when they heard Gu Changge\u2019s earlier words. Fangtian then asked, \u201cYour Highness, what do you mean by those words earlier?\u201dGu Changge casually replied, \u201cI say, Chu Kuangren will not join this marriage by combat. This is what my sister told me personally.\u201dBefore going to the Luminous Moon Secret Realm, Gu Changge had discussed Chu Kuangren with Princess Linglong. The Princess told him then about Chu Kuangren\u2019s disinterest in her Godly Essence and the fact that he would not participate in the marriage by combat.After hearing what Gu Changge had to say, a ray of hope appeared in everyone\u2019s eyes.\u201cI can\u2019t believe Chu Kuangren is not interested in the Godly Essence. Haha, he unknowingly gave us that chance instead.\u201d\u201cIs this person a real man? The Princess is so beautiful and she even possesses the Godly Essence, yet you\u2019re telling me that he\u2019s not a single bit interested?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s good news for us. He better not mind if we do take it for ourselves then.\u201dOnce the crowd was done being delighted over that fact, Fangtian then looked towards Gu Changge and asked curiously, \u201cYour highness, why are you telling us all this?\u201dA sense of coldness flashed past Gu Changge\u2019s eyes. \u201cSame like everyone here, I personally dislike Chu Kuangren. I don\u2019t mind my sister being wed to anyone, so long as that person is not Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cI see.\u201d\u2026Royal Azure Dynasty, inside the royal palace.Princess Linglong was inside her personal chambers. Sitting on the bed, she had a blade in her grasps. That blade was the sacred weapon, Full Moon Blade.\u201cThis Sage Daoist Rhyme is indeed extraordinary. Seeing that the blade still has some very mysterious Sage Daoist Rhyme remaining within, it should be sufficient for me to absorb it for some time.\u201dPrincess Linglong had a distracted look in her eyes as her slender fingers stroked across the blade gently. Nobody knew what she was thinking of at the time.\u201cHis royal majesty has arrived!\u201dJust then, the voice of the court maids could be heard from outside her chambers.The Ruler of the Royal Azure Dynasty, a middle-aged man around his forties or fifties who was dressed in an imperial dragon robe walked into the room.Princess Linglong kept the sacred weapon, stood up, and greeted, \u201cGreetings, father.\u201d\u201cAt ease, my daughter,\u201d said the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Ruler with a slight smile. However, his expression turned very stiff and gloomy following that.A surge of utterly horrifying and domineering aura was swept out uncontrollably. It was so powerful that it made the palace maids fall to their knees in fright.They were all terribly frightened since they did not know what had made the dignified and elegant Ruler of the Royal Azure Dynasty suddenly so enraged.\u201cEveryone else except my daughter, leave this place at once.\u201dSoon after, the whole palace chamber was left empty except Princess Linglong and the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Ruler. That domineering aura of his still lingered as it filled their surroundings.\u201cTell me, who is it?\u201d\u201cWho did you give your Godly Essence to?\u201dThe Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Ruler asked as he held back his rage.Having brought up Princess Linglong since young, and as an Honorable Supreme cultivator himself, it did not take long for him to notice something strange about her.The Godly Essence within Princess Linglong had disappeared!That was a matter concerning his daughter\u2019s purity and innocence, how could he not get mad?\u201cFather, please cancel the marriage by combat.\u201dPrincess Linglong said calmly.\u201cWe\u2019ll talk about this later. Now tell me, who is it? I\u2019m going to skin that b*st*rd now!\u201d\u201cI did it willingly.\u201d\u201cWillingly?\u201d The Royal Azure Dynasty King froze for a while before he asked, \u201cDo you know what you\u2019re talking about here? It\u2019s only a few days until the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor arrives, and when he does, he\u2019ll be participating in the marriage by combat as well. If word of this spread to him, it would cause a rift to happen between the Royal Azure Dynasty and the Shang Clan.\u201d\u201cHad I known that something was going to happen earlier, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to let you host this marriage by combat in the first place. Now, such a disgraceful thing has happened. What a joke.\u201dThe more he thought of it, the more enraged the Royal Azure Dynasty King became. He could not wait to go after the person who had robbed his daughter\u2019s innocence, cut him into pieces, skin him alive, and tear his limbs apart.\u201cTell me now. Who is that person?\u201dPrincess Linglong pursed her lips and was silent for a while. \u201cHe\u2019s the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect, Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him.\u201dThe enraged Royal Azure Dynasty King was taken aback for a moment, but he eventually calmed down after a while. Right then, he had a pondering look in his eyes. \u201cSo it\u2019s him.\u201d\u201cI met him when we were inside the Secret Realm, we were facing\u2026\u201d Princess Linglong then told him everything that transpired inside the domain of the Gray Mist.As the Royal Azure Dynasty King listened, his anger had disappeared from his face and it was replaced with a look of consideration. \u201cIf it\u2019s him, it\u2019s not that unacceptable.\u201dPrincess Linglong was speechless.She had known that things would turn out like this earlier on. To the Ruler of the Royal Azure Dynasty, she was not his daughter but a marriage tool to secure the allegiance of others instead.As long as there were benefits, who was to say that any marriage would not count as one?\u201cChu Kuangren, Supreme Daoist Physique, Supreme Foundation, hm\u2026 He killed an Honorable Supreme in the past, killed Lei Ao, and also killed a weakened sage in the Secret Realm\u2026\u201d\u201cThis person is a peerless talent.\u201d\u201cBesides, the Black Heaven Sect does not fall short compared to the Shang Clan. On the other hand, they might serve as a better allegiance partner compared to the Shang Clan.\u201dThe Royal Azure Dynasty King murmured.Standing beside him, Princess Linglong suddenly felt excited.\u2018A marriage with Chu Kuangren?\u2019To her, she would rather agree to wed Chu Kuangren compared to some Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor whom she had never met before.\u201cLet me deal with this matter,\u201d the Royal Azure Dynasty King told her.\u2026Outside the Royal Azure Dynasty.A fairy boat was traveling high up in the air.A young cultivator in green robes was sitting with his legs crossed on deck. That young cultivator had an energetic look as a surge of Daoist Rhyme emanated around his body.Not long after, the green-robed cultivator retracted his Daoist Rhyme. \u201cI\u2019m only one step away from ascending to the Battle Monarch Realm. It\u2019s getting closer now.\u201d\u201cYoung Emperor, we shall be arriving soon.\u201d An elder person walked towards and informed him.\u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cYoung Emperor, there\u2019s something that I don\u2019t understand. Why did you agree to Princess Linglong\u2019s request to let her organize the marriage by combat? Isn\u2019t this an unnecessary action?\u201dThe green-robed cultivator gently replied, \u201cShe\u2019s a type of woman who will not easily submit to the will of others. Organizing this marriage by combat is simply her way of going against this marriage agreement. Don\u2019t worry, I shall let her know how everything she did is futile!\u201d\u201cBefore me, she will only submit!\u201d\u201cBesides, this is my first time in the Azure Dragon\u2019s domain, so I might as well have a go at the sky-prides within this area.\u201dThe green-robed cultivator\u2019s words were full of confidence. He was not at all worried about losing in the marriage by combat because he was the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor!\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is. Young Emperor, I almost thought you had fallen for Princess Linglong herself just now.\u201d The old man suddenly understood.\u201cTo me, she is but a tool for me to break through my cultivation. Tell me, elder, will you ever fall in love with a tool?\u201d The Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor sneered.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although most of it had been handed over to Elder Ruyan for her to bring back to the sect, there were still some that he kept with him.\u201cHey, is this\u2026\u201d Chu Kuangren suddenly wondered in a soft voice.While he was tidying, his eyes could not help but lit up when he found another Yin and Yang ring from the Black Light Sage\u2019s corpse.\u2018The Yin and Yang ring of a sage. What kind of valuable riches will lie in this?\u2019Chu Kuangren opened it up excitedly.However, what he saw instead was an empty dimension within the Yin and Yang ring. There were some soulstones, a few vials of medicinal pills, and some other scraps.\u201cIt can\u2019t be. Was that Sage really that poor?\u201d Chu Kuangren pouted before he continued to tidy the items inside it.There was no need to bother with the medicinal pills and soulstones.His attention was drawn to the piles of scrap instead. There was a token, a Jade Scroll, and a few pieces of clothing among them.The token was black and it emanated a heavy aura when held in his hands. There were also some Qi of Death swirling around the token, which had multiple runes and the words \u2018Preserve Technique\u2019 carved onto it.Chu Kuangren remembered that when he checked the Black Light Sage\u2019s information using his Eye of Revelation, he obtained the words \u2018Sacred Palace of Death\u2019.\u201cWhat kind of force is the Sacred Palace of Death? I\u2019ve never heard about it before. But with a sage within its rank, it must be a formidable group.\u201dChu Kuangren thought of it and kept that token away.After that, he picked up the piece of Jade Scroll.As his spiritual thoughts began, a sudden burst of Daoist Rhyme erupted before large amounts of information flowed into his mind and formed into two big words \u2026 Gluttonous Devouring!A Sage Technique was recorded onto that piece of Jade Scroll!Having gone through multiple occurrences of Daoist Enlightenment, Chu Kuangren\u2019s understanding of the Dao was already at a very deep and refined level. It was even comparable to an Honorable Realm cultivator\u2019s level.Although that Sage Technique seemed very interesting, Chu Kuangren had a general understanding of its uses just by taking a look at it.\u201cHow powerful!\u201d\u201cThis is definitely a type of Sage Ruler Technique!\u201d\u201cThis might even be a more exquisite technique than the Human Mountain Stamp! I\u2019m afraid this technique is very close to the level of an Emperor Technique.\u201dChu Kuangren was extremely surprised.Ancient legends had it that there was once a dragon who had nine children and one of them was named Avarice. It was said Avarice possessed the ability to devour thousands of living beings to strengthen itself.Hence, the Gluttonous Devouring Technique was created based on the ancient beast Avarice. It had the function to devour the essences of flesh and blood to increase the user\u2019s cultivation.\u201cConsuming others to strengthen oneself. This technique is quite creepy.\u201d\u201cYet, this is a world where the strong preyed on the weak. If one is not strong, they will, in return, be bullied by others for their weaknesses!\u201dWhen Chu Kuangren thought of that, he then decided to cultivate that technique for his use.Taking the opportunity that the marriage by combat had not started, Chu Kuangren informed Lan Yu and Li Xingchen about this before he began his closed-door meditation to cultivate that technique.Since the Black Light Sage himself had also cultivated that technique, the remnant Daoist Rhymes in his corpse was a great help to Chu Kuangren in learning how to use that technique.\u2026In the Capital City, everyone was looking forward to that marriage by combat event.This was especially for the crowd of sky-prides who were looking forward to the chance of getting the Godly Essence. They intended to use it to break through into higher realms of cultivation and surpass Chu Kuangren\u2019s level.However, the date of the marriage by combat had yet arrived before they received extremely enraging news instead. The marriage by combat was\u2026 Canceled!That news immediately angered everyone.They had traveled a long way from their respective areas just to take part in that competition, yet they did not even have a chance to touch a single hair of hers. Instead, they were all fooled by the Royal Azure Dynasty.Numerous cultivators were filled with so much outrage that they demanded an explanation from the Royal Dynasty.\u201cI\u2019ve come to a far *ss place just to take part in the Princess\u2019s marriage by combat, but now you\u2019re telling me that it\u2019s canceled?\u201d\u201cAre you messing with us? You\u2019re kidding, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t even seen the Princess yet and the event is already over?\u201d\u201cWhat a scam!\u201dMany sky-prides in the Capital City said angrily.The cultivators from the normal orthodoxies were fine with it since they could easily be dealt with if the Royal Azure Dynasty just gave them some amount of soulstones as repayment.It was the ones from the sage orthodoxies who were pissed off.Some consideration would have to be done to deal with those people.However, the Royal Azure Dynasty King was dealing with another person at that time.\u2026The Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor had arrived in the Capital City.He was being welcomed personally by the Royal Azure Dynasty King himself.Even Princess Linglong had shown herself at that time. When he first laid eyes on her, the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor was a bit stunned by her beauty despite being a devoted Daoist.Princess Linglong was an exquisite beauty and unparalleled in looks. Her every move had a dignified and noble temperament, which made anyone want to look up to her.For a rare moment, the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor had a faint feeling that he was falling for her.\u201cGreetings Your Majesty the Royal Azure Dynasty King and Your Highness the Royal Princess.\u201d The Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor gently nodded.\u201cAt ease, Young Emperor.\u201dThe Royal Azure Dynasty King smiled and brought the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor to the gardens at the back of the palace. Not sparing any time for nonsense, he immediately told him about wanting to dissolve their marriage agreements.The elder who was accompanying the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor had a terrible look on his face when he heard that. He said, \u201cYour Majesty, are you messing with my Shang Clan?\u201dThe Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor then took a look at Princess Linglong and said, \u201cIs there any dissatisfaction that Your Highness the Princess has about me?\u201d\u201cThe man is not the problem, but\u2026\u201d When the Royal Azure Dynasty King spoke of this, he paused and sighed with regret. Then, he told them what had happened inside the Secret Realm of the Luminous Moon.\u201cNow that my daughter has lost her innocence and purity, she doubts her qualifications as the Young Emperor\u2019s bride. This is why she personally suggested the idea of dissolving the marriage agreement.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m naturally aware that he\u2019s at fault, hence I have prepared generous gifts as compensation. Besides this, I shall send someone out to the Shang Clan to deliver my personal apologies.\u201dUpon hearing this, the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor\u2019s expression was already very grim.\u00a0He felt as if a field of grass had grown on his head, sporting with green lushness1.\u2018I can\u2019t believe Princess Linglong gave her Godly Essence to someone else!\u2019Glaring at the peerless beauty that was Princess Linglong, the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor erased the hint of love that he had for the Princess before.The more he thought about it, the more angry and uncomfortable he felt. That unbearable feeling was like a large boulder on his chest, making him feel overwhelmed and out of breath.He had intended to use the Godly Essence to ascend to a higher cultivation realm, but now his plans were ruined. No matter man or cultivator, that was something which would enrage them and made them feel unacceptable.\u201cFortunately, only both our Royal Azure Dynasty and your Shang Clan know of the arranged marriage. Now that we\u2019re dissolving the marriage agreements, it\u2019ll be easy to act as if nothing has ever happened, and there will be no damage to either party\u2019s reputation.\u201dThe Royal Azure Dynasty King continued speaking.Up until that point, Princess Linglong, who was beside him, did not utter a single word.\u201cVery well, splendid!\u201d\u201cSince your majesty has already made all the necessary agreements, what else is there for us to say? Elder, let\u2019s leave now!\u201dWith that, the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor stood up and left, all while trying hard to hold back his anger.\u201cHold up.\u201dThe Royal Azure Dynasty King\u2019s words made him stop in his tracks. \u201cI shall be hosting a large banquet in the palace today. In addition to this, I have invited many sky-prides as well to explain why the marriage by combat was canceled. The Young Emperor is invited to attend if he is interested.\u201d\u201cThen what about that Chu Kuangren? Will he be attending?\u201d\u201cHe should be.\u201d\u201cGot it, I\u2019ll be there.\u201dThe Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor replied coldly.After that, only Princess Linglong and the Royal Azure Dynasty King were left in the garden.\u201cFather, will the Shang Clan give up that easily?\u201dPrincess Linglong asked.\u201cI\u2019ve prepared generous amounts of gifts for them besides upholding the required etiquettes that are necessary. The higher-ups of the Shang Clan are not foolish. Although this matter will damage both sides\u2019 relationship, no major conflict will happen because of it.\u201d\u201cThen\u2026 What about the Black Heaven Sect?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve already discussed with their Honorable Xuan Qi. From this day onwards, Chu Kuangren will not only be the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother, but also the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess. Regarding the date of the wedding, I\u2019ll leave it to both of you to decide yourselves.\u201d1The Royal Azure Dynasty King chuckled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 72": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 72Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayCapital City, inside one of the rooms of an inn.Chu Kuangren had just woken from his closed-door meditation. In just a few days, Chu Kuangren had achieved a preliminary mastery of the Gluttonous Devouring Technique based on the level of understanding he had in the Dao and the help he got from the Black Light Sage\u2019s corpse.That technique was a very powerful one and would be of great use to Chu Kuangren. However, it could easily harm a person\u2019s karmic luck, so it had to be used with caution.It was true.Luck and merits existed in this world of cultivation. Based on this belief, numerous cultivators who possessed terrifying powers dared not go on a killing spree, for fear that their karma would incur debts and accumulate bad luck.\u201cYou\u2019re finally awake, little fella. Did you make any progress?\u201dThe Seventh Forefather\u2019s voice came from the void.\u201cYeah, somewhat I guess,\u201d Chu Kuangren replied gently.\u201cGood to hear. Listen, I have some news to tell you, kid. To be able to make Princess Linglong yours, you really are not short in terms of luck, looks, or prosperity.\u201dChu Kuangre was just taking a drink of water when he heard what the Seventh Forefather told him, and he immediately spat it all out. His face was full of shock. \u201cHow did you know about this Seventh Forefather!\u201d\u201cNot only me, kid. Even the Sect Leader and all the others know.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dChu Kuangren hurriedly asked.\u201cThe Sect Leader has agreed to an alliance between the Black Heaven Sect and the Royal Azure Dynasty two days ago. And you kid will soon be the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess.\u201dChu Kuangren was dumbfounded.What in the world had happened during the days that he underwent a closed-door meditation?Only a few days had passed and he was already sold off?\u2018How much was I sold off for?\u2019\u2018Maybe split some of it with me?\u2019\u201cNo, wait. Seventh Forefather, why didn\u2019t you inform me earlier?\u201d\u201cHer Royal Highness Princess Linglong has already given you her Godly Essence. Now that the people from the lady\u2019s side are at your door, don\u2019t tell me you\u2019re thinking of backing them down?\u201dThe Seventh Forefather teased.\u201cPrincess Linglong and I did that for valid reasons. Besides, we were just trying to protect ourselves when we decided to do that. We have no feelings for each other at all. \u201d\u201cIt\u2019s alright, kid. Relationships can be nurtured and built up gradually. If you really are not fond of her, you can still settle that matter on paper when the time comes and when you\u2019re even more powerful.\u201dChu Kuangren was speechless.\u2018How can I do this? That\u2019s too scummy even for me!\u2019However, Chu Kuangren seemed to understand something else from the Seventh Forefather\u2019s words. \u201cSo we\u2019re letting me be under the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s protection.\u201d\u201cYeah, right on all accounts.\u201d\u201cThe first reason we agreed this was that an alliance with the Royal Azure Dynasty will benefit and serve to help both parties. Secondly, we did it because of you.\u201d\u201cListen, kid, your abilities and skills are just too talented and remarkable. Because of them, you will be a target for many others out there. Although the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s influence is large, we cannot assure you that your safety will be guaranteed all the time. To do this, we\u2019ll need the help of our allies too.\u201d\u201cThe Royal Azure Dynasty is a sage orthodoxy whose power is on par with the Black Heaven\u2019s Sect\u2019s. If we put you and Princess Linglong in a marriage arrangement, the Royal Azure Dynasty will no doubt be obliged to have you under their protection as well. All in all, both our sage orthodoxies will ensure your safety together.\u201dAt the Seventh Forefather\u2019s words, Chu Kuangren went into deep thought.He was not only grateful for how thoughtful the Black Heaven Sect was but by doing this, he would also be able to return what he owed to Princess Linglong for her help and sacrifice.As of now, the marriage arrangement only had benefits and no repercussions for him.\u201cFianc\u00e9? Now that\u2019s a first for me.\u201dChu Kuangren said as he scratched his head.\u201cOi kid, how many times do you want to be one huh?\u201dThe Seventh Forefather replied unpleasantly.\u2026As Chu Kuangren came out of his room, Lan Yu was already waiting outside.\u201cMaster, I see you\u2019re finished with the closed-door cultivation.\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d Chu Kuangren laughed and nodded. He hesitated for a while before he told Lan Yu about his arranged marriage with Princess Linglong.Lan Yu was stunned for a while with a bitter feeling in her heart. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Master to have such an arrangement with Princess Linglong. With this in mind, how shall I address her the next time we meet? Shall I call her Mistress?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no need for those worries. Another thing, Lan Yu. I have never regarded you as my slave nor servant.\u201d Chu Kuangren spoke the last sentence in a serious manner.When she heard that, Lan Yu\u2019s heart throbbed.To someone like her, Chu Kuangren\u2019s existence was similar to that of a God, a creator so to speak, while she only saw herself as a servant that he had created.There was a clear boundary between a servant and a God.However, this God had been treating her with too much gentleness.He was so gentle that a different feeling might arise within her from time to time, seemingly making her want to cross the imaginary boundary that she made herself.\u201cBrother Chu, there\u2019s someone here to see you.\u201dAt that time, Li Xingchen shouted for him from below.There was an old man with a tall hat behind him.\u201cHey look, that\u2019s Magistrate Cao from the Royal Palace.\u201d\u201cWord says that this guy is the confidant of the Royal Azure Dynasty King. He usually stays within the royal palace on normal occasions, so what brings him here today?\u201d\u201cMoreover, he\u2019s looking for Chu Kuangren as well. That\u2019s weird.\u201dThe cultivators in the inn were deep in discussions.Chu Kuangren then brought Lan Yu downstairs with him.\u201cMaster Chu, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you today.\u201d Upon seeing Chu Kuangren, Magistrate Cao immediately went up and bowed to him in front of everyone.The crowd was instantly dumbstruck.Magistrate Cao\u2019s position was quite extraordinary as he was in charge of the royal palace\u2019s internal affairs. Due to that, even the crown princes had to treat him with respect.Now, a person like him was bowing down to Chu Kuangren.On some level, it was a representation of the Royal Azure Dynasty King\u2019s will.\u201cIt\u2019s my pleasure as well, Magistrate Cao.\u201d Chu Kuangren chuckled as he casually checked that man\u2019s information using the Eye of Revelation. \u2018Damn, this fellow is an Honorable Realm cultivator.\u2019Indeed, people like him who were able to accompany the Royal Azure Dynasty King was no joke.\u201cMaster Chu, his majesty has asked me to invite you for a visit to the royal palace.\u201d\u201cAlright, I understand.\u201dChu Kuangren nodded and he then took Lan Yu with him to visit the royal palace.Further at the back of the royal palace\u2019s gardens.The Royal Azure Dynasty King had already been prepared to welcome Chu Kuangren for a while now. Since he had only heard of Chu Kuangren, he was quite excited and intrigued to finally meet him.Not long after.Magistrate Cao led Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu into the gardens.Seeing Chu Kuangren for the first time, even the Royal Azure Dynasty King, who was very knowledgeable and had seen many things, could not help but be surprised. He said as he marveled, \u201cA fairy who\u2019s living among men.\u201dDonning a white robe and a jade crown on his head, the Royal Azure Dynasty King had an exceedingly handsome look for someone his age. He was like a piece of jade who possessed unparalleled beauty.\u201cGreetings, Your Majesty the Royal Azure Dynasty King.\u201d Since this was his first time meeting His Majesty as well, Chu Kuangren could not help but be attracted to the sparkling imperial robe he wore.\u201cAt ease. Come, take a seat.\u201d\u201cThank you, Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cHeh, you won\u2019t need to address me like that for long. After a few days, you\u2019ll have to address me as \u2018father\u2019 like Linglong does now.\u201d The Royal Azure Dynasty King chuckled.Chu Kuangren smiled and laughed, but he did not say much.\u201cI have asked you to visit this time because I wanted to meet you personally. Also, I wanted to inform you that I\u2019ll announce you as her fianc\u00e9 to the public in two days.\u201d\u201cUnderstood. I shall leave the necessary arrangements to Your Majesty.\u201d\u201cMhm, very well.\u201dThe Royal Azure Dynasty King nodded and did not say another word after that.However, that made Chu Kuangren even more uncomfortable as he did not know what to talk about. With the two of them sitting there together, the atmosphere suddenly became somewhat awkward.\u201cHer Majesty the Queen has arrived.\u201d At that moment, a woman with a noble and graceful poise walked towards them slowly. Her appearance was quite similar to her daughter, Princess Linglong.Chu Kuangren then stood up to greet her. \u201cGreetings Your Royal Majesty Queen of the Royal Azure Dynasty.\u201d\u201cOh my, you must be Chu Kuangren, am I right? You do have the look of a heavenly being. No wonder my Linglong was completely charmed by you.\u201d\u201cYour Majesty\u2019s praise is too generous. Seeing that Your Majesty the Queen is the mother of the whole nation, that to me is the true appearance of a heavenly being.\u201d\u201cOh, that\u2019s so sweet of you.\u201dThe Royal Azure Queen was a very chatty person, having talked endlessly about topics ranging from astrology to geography while casually inserting some interesting anecdotes in between.Besides, she was also quite perceptive to body language. The moment she noticed that Chu Kuangren was not able to continue with a certain topic or was uninterested in it, she would instantly change to another with grace and elegance.From the moment she arrived, the atmosphere had suddenly become a lot warmer.\u201cKuangren, do feel free to visit the royal palace when you\u2019re free.\u201dBefore they left, the Royal Azure\u2019s Queen said reluctantly.\u201cI will, Your Majesty.\u201dChu Kuangren was quite anxious at that time. That Queen was too good of a speaker, having spoken and talked for almost a whole day without any breaks between; even he felt unable to carry on with the conversation.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

After all, they still had an unknown flame welling up within them.They had traveled far just to join the marriage by combat, yet it was just canceled like that. It would be strange to say that they did not mind it.Everyone was waiting for the Royal Azure Dynasty King to give them an explanation.However, a part of the crowd had also noticed a seemingly unknown sky-pride among them, but that person was sitting extremely close to the front. It was even closer to the host\u2019s seat compared to top-tiered sky-prides like Fangtian or even Yuanhong.\u201cWho is that person?\u201dSome of the people were curious to find out.Just then, two figures walked into the royal palace hall. It was Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu.When they saw him, everyone in the crowd started talking.\u201cWhat\u2019s Chu Kuangren doing here? Isn\u2019t he uninterested in the marriage by combat?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. Everyone present is those who wanted an explanation for the cancellation. What\u2019s that uninterested guy doing here for?\u201dFacing the confused gazes from the people in the crowd, Chu Kuangren was calm and he eventually found his seat with the guidance of a palace maid.His seat was extremely close to the front, which was in the same row as Gu Changge.\u201cD*mn, why is he sitting in the same row as me?\u201d Gu Changge secretly cursed as he felt somewhat uncomfortable near him.Chu Kuangren did not care. In fact, he was even delighted to see Gu Changge\u2019s aggrieved look because honestly speaking, Chu Kuangren was quite adept at scheming sometimes.Yet suddenly, he felt someone\u2019s very unpleasant and hostile gaze on him.Looking towards its direction, Chu Kuangren saw a green-robed cultivator glaring at him. There was a strong feeling of hostility in that guy\u2019s eyes.\u2018An unknown sky-pride?\u2019\u2018Then again, where\u2019s all this hate coming from?\u2019Puzzled, Chu Kuangren activated his Eye of Revelation and checked.\u201cShang Han, Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor, Cultivation level \u2013 Paradise Realm Complete \u2026\u201dOnly when Chu Kuangren saw the information did he realize why.So that was the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor. No wonder that guy had so much hostility towards him. After all, Chu Kuangren had cucked the guy.He then looked back at Shang Han with a pitiful gaze.Click\u2026As if he had noticed Chu Kuangren\u2019s sorrowful gaze, Shang Han immediately clenched his fist, shattering the glass of wine he had into dust.The surrounding sky-prides were startled when they saw that.\u2018That unknown sky-pride seems very pissed off at Chu Kuangren.\u2019At that thought, they all felt better as they looked at Shang Han. Some of them even felt that similar anger and rage.\u2018I guess everyone here must be sky-prides that were dominated by Chu Kuangren before huh.\u2019\u201cHis Royal Majesty has arrived.\u201dThe Royal Azure Dynasty King was seen with the Royal Azure Queen beside him, and following them from behind was Princess Linglong. The crowd of sky-prides immediately rose to greet and welcome them upon seeing this. Most of their gazes, however, fell behind the Royal Azure Dynasty King and onto Princess Linglong instead.Princess Linglong was wearing a splendidly beautiful dress that day. With her hair rolled and held up with a nine-feathered phoenix hairpin, it made her look ever so stunning and noble as well.Even Chu Kuangren subconsciously looked at her.Both of their gazes met for an instant before they immediately separated.However, in Shang Han\u2019s eyes, that scene seemed like an intimate gaze between loving couples, brewing with some sort of affection.At that point, the hostile intent in his eyes became even stronger.\u201cAt ease everyone, please sit.\u201dThe Royal Azure Dynasty King smiled calmly.Once everyone had sat down, the Royal Azure Dynasty King spared no time for nonsense. \u201cI know that everyone is very displeased by the cancellation of the marriage by combat event. That is why I\u2019ve organized this banquet for everyone today to give an explanation and also some compensation.\u201d\u201cAfter the banquet, every orthodoxy here is allowed to send forth a representative to pick any one item they desire from the royal treasury.\u201dThe Royal Azure Treasury was the very foundation of the Royal Azure Dynasty, and within it laid countless valuables and treasures. Letting them inside the treasury to pick any one item was truly a display of sincerity from the Royal Azure Dynasty King.By then, most of the dissatisfaction within the crowd had disappeared.After all, the organizers had decided to cancel the marriage by combat, so what else could they do? Force them to reorganize it?Being able to get their hands on any treasure without doing anything was already splendid news to them.Although the items within the royal treasury would not be as worthy as the Godly Essence, they were not sure they could stand out and win if the marriage by combat were to continue.However, the valuables were real and could surely be obtained.\u201cIf I\u2019m allowed to ask, can Your Majesty explain why the marriage by combat event was canceled so abruptly?\u201d Fangtian was still curious.\u201cThis is what I\u2019m about to explain. This marriage by combat event was canceled because Princess Linglong already has someone in her heart. Coincidently, that person is sitting among all of you today.\u201d The Royal Azure Dynasty King chuckled.The moment those words came out, everyone in the crowd looked at each other confusingly.\u201cWho is it? Which b*st*rd here stole the Princess\u2019s heart?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t tell me it\u2019s Chu Kuangren. Thinking back then, the Princess did look at him with starry-eyes for a few times.\u201d\u201cIt can\u2019t be right. Isn\u2019t Chu Kuangren not interested in Princess Linglong? He had never bothered to join the marriage by combat event before.\u201d\u201cThen who could it be?\u201dSome of them were staring at Princess Linglong, intending to spot any clues from her. However, they noticed that her gaze was locked in a certain direction across the hall.Following her gaze, all they saw was Chu Kuangren.Fangtian, Yuanhong, and others all felt a sudden halt in their hearts.\u2018It can\u2019t be, it can\u2019t be, it can\u2019t be, right? Is it really Chu Kuangren?\u2019\u201cThat man is the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect, Chu Kuangren!\u201d Just when everyone in the crowd was unsure about the person, the Royal Azure Dynasty King announced immediately.Everyone\u2019s gaze shot towards and focused on Chu Kuangren.\u201cBesides, I have already made arrangements with Black Heaven Sect. From this day onwards, Chu Kuangren shall be the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess.\u201dWithout waiting for the crowd to recover from their daze, the Royal Azure Dynasty King dropped another bombshell onto them which shocked them silly.Fangtian, Yuanhong, and the others looked at Chu Kuangren with bloodshot eyes.1\u2018Go f*ck yourself!\u2019\u2018Didn\u2019t you say you were uninterested in the Princess?\u2019\u2018Now why the h*ll are you the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess? \u2018\u2018As if letting you completely ransack the Secret Realm was not enough, now you even upped and took Princess Linglong for yourself as well! Can\u2019t you leave us a good reward?\u2019Everyone lost it at that moment.They cursed Chu Kuangren in their hearts with every word in the book.However, what use could that do?Most of the treasures in the Luminous Moon Secret Realm were already taken by Chu Kuangren, yet now, he was the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess too. Possessing both wealth and women, what a great winner he was!\u201cFather, I object to this!\u201dThen, Gu Changge leaped out with his objection.Giving Chu Kuangren the Godly Essence and declaring him the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess, what kind of joke was this! He would be enraged if that were the case!\u201cSilence!\u201dThe Royal Azure Dynasty King yelled with a chilling gaze, \u201cYou are a Crown Prince of the Royal Azure Dynasty. You\u2019re now in a place before the public, so act like one!\u201dHe was the one who planned the marriage arrangement with the Black Heaven Sect. How could he willingly cancel it just because of a few words from Gu Changge?\u201cFather, Chu Kuangren is an arrogant and mad person. He is not suitable as the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess!\u201d\u201cHe is suitable because I myself deem him so. As to being arrogant and mad, who was not crazy during their younger years? And what\u2019s so wrong about it then?\u201d\u201cFather\u2026\u201d\u201cMy dear Prince, are you drunk perhaps?\u201dJust when Gu Changge was about to say something, the Royal Azure Dynasty King glared at him as he spoke those words. That very indifferent look was a sign that his father\u2019s anger was about to erupt.Gu Changge shuddered. Although he felt very unsatisfied and reluctant, he did not dare to further go against his father. Hence, he had no choice but to bow and sit back down.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 74": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 74Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayThe Royal Azure King had publicly announced Chu Kuangren as the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess!That news alone was like a tossed stone that stirred up thousands of ripples as all the sky-prides present had a complicated feeling within them. At that same time, they also thought about how the alliance between the Royal Azure Dynasty and Black Heaven Sect would impact the former\u2019s power.However, no matter what, the fact that Chu Kuangren was now the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess had been established.The crowd of people in the banquet could only stare at him with looks of jealousy and contempt.\u2018Possessing a Supreme Daoist Physique, having peerless talents, and coming from a Black Heaven Sect sage orthodoxy with various cultivation resources available at demand, and now Chu Kuangren has become the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess; even Princess Linglong who has unparalleled beauty is now\u2026\u2019\u2018Oh right, there\u2019s also Lan Yu who was even more devoted to him as well.\u2019\u2018Powerful techniques, beautiful women, properties of wealth, and pieces of land. All of these are things that cultivators should not yearn to possess!\u2019\u2018Yet Chu Kuangren alone possesses all of them!\u2019\u2018How can anyone not feel jealous of him? How can anyone not despise him for what he has?\u2019Chu Kuangren sat in his place and paid no heed to the dozens of gazes that were as sharp as knives. \u2018What\u2019s the matter, scared to make a move?\u2019\u201cBrother Chu, you are indeed full of surprises.\u201d Sitting beside him, Li Xingchen hurriedly leaned towards him with an impressed expression.\u2018Take a look at this guy. Saying all those things about not having any interests, but he still went and took Princess Linglong for himself without anyone knowing.\u2019\u2018That\u2019s f*cking awesome!\u2019\u201cWith Princess Linglong\u2019s noble position and Royal Azure Dynasty behind your back, Brother Chu, you have obtained a huge benefit for yourself,\u201d Li Xingchen said.\u201cI for one think that being able to be the Master\u2019s Fianc\u00e9e is a culmination of the karmic blessing that Princess Linglong has cultivated for eight lifetimes,\u201d Lan Yu who was beside them said with a somewhat bitter tone.Li Xingchen then thought for a while. \u201cYeah, it does make some sense.\u201dChu Kuangren had the heavenly looks of a fairy, vast amounts of talent, and also a high ranking status in the world of cultivation. Compared to Princess Linglong, he would appear better if not similar.If Princess Linglong was said to be the best among the young female cultivators, then Chu Kuangren would be the most unique and peerless one among the male cultivators.The more Li Xingchen thought, the more he felt that it made sense. He further lamented, \u201cWait until the news of this spreads, who knows how many female cultivator\u2019s hearts will be broken then.\u201d\u201cYou must be joking. That\u2019s too ridiculous!\u201dChu Kuangren laughed.\u201cThe Royal Azure Dynasty is one of the best Sage Orthodoxies in the world, so its Elder Princess\u2019s Fianc\u00e9 should naturally be one of the best talents in this world too.\u201dAt that point, the voice suddenly rang out.It was Shang Han, the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor.Everyone looked towards him as he continued speaking, \u201cWord says that our fellow Daoist Chu has peerless and remarkable talents. My name is Shang Han, please allow my bold request to learn from you by combat.\u201dFangtian, Yuanhong, and the others looked at each other confusingly.\u2018What?\u2019Did they hear that right?\u2018This guy wants to challenge Chu Kuangren?\u2019\u2018Who the h*ll is he kidding. Does he want to die so quickly?\u2019Although they had an unpleasant opinion of Chu Kuangren, they still had to admit and acknowledge his depressingly overpowering strength.They were not even a match for Chu Kuangren despite having banded together to fight him, yet this guy here dared to challenge him alone? Did something break in his head?\u201cSigh, he\u2019s seeking a shameful disgrace!\u201d Fangtian said as he shook his head.\u201cWe might have had such an idea of challenging Chu Kuangren alone in the past, but now\u2026 Sigh, the very thought of bringing it up pains me to tears.\u201dLin Batian of the Zhiyang Valley could not help but sigh in despair.\u201cWait a minute, Shang Han\u2026\u201dOne of the sky-prides suddenly reacted, feeling that the name was quite familiar to him.Yuanhong\u2019s pupils immediately shrank. \u201cShang\u2026 Can it be the ancient clan of the Scarlet Phoenix Domain, the Shang Clan! That means Shang Han is the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor!\u201dWhen the words \u2018Young Emperor\u2019 came out, everyone in the crowd gasped.They had never thought that they would meet a Young Emperor here.\u201cThe Shang Clan is one of the Sage Orthodoxies in the Scarlet Phoenix Domain. Their power is quite similar to the Royal Azure Dynasty, if not weaker. So that\u2019s him huh, the Young Emperor Shang Han.\u201d\u201cNo wonder he dares to challenge Chu Kuangren.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard the rumors say that he might be stronger than Lei Ao.\u201dMultiple discussions started to build up among the crowd in the banquet, with everyone looking at Young Emperor Shang Han with gazes of admiration and curiosity.Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren, the challenged party, sat quietly in his place and chuckled. \u201cFellow Daoist Shang, are you sure you want to challenge me?\u201dShang Han raised his eyebrows in surprise. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem? Can\u2019t do it?\u201d\u201cNope, it\u2019s not that. But I have a little problem and that is I can\u2019t really hold back my punches that well. A few days ago, I accidentally killed a Young Emperor because of that, so I\u2019m worried that you won\u2019t be able to handle my attacks for long.\u201dEveryone\u2019s mouth could not help but twitch when they heard his words.\u2018Accidentally killed a Young Emperor?\u2019\u2018Lei Ao will rise from the dead out of pure spite and anger if he heard that.\u2019Everyone naturally understood the hidden meaning behind Chu Kuangren\u2019s words, which implied that he was not taking this Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor seriously at all.To put it simply, his words meant, \u2018I have accidentally killed someone else on the same Young Emperor level as you, so how long do you think you can withstand my attacks?\u2019Shang Han\u2019s expression was so cold, it was as if there was a layer of frost on his face. He then said, \u201cChu Kuangren, your name isn\u2019t misgiven indeed.\u201d\u201cI agree that it\u2019s not a bad one. It was given to me by my parents.\u201d\u201cKuangren, since the Shang Clan\u2019s Young Emperor has traveled far and is interested in fighting you, why don\u2019t you agree and keep him company? Either way is fine with me,\u201d the Royal Azure Dynasty King suddenly said.Chu Kuangren nodded. \u201cSince Your Majesty has spoken, then I shall not back down. It\u2019s not convenient for us here, let\u2019s head outside for our match.\u201dWithout another word, Shang Han stood up and headed outside the palace hall.\u2026Outside the royal palace.Shang Han stood still as the wind blew against him. His green robes could be heard fluttering in the wind as Daoist Rhymes swirled around his body. His terribly potent and domineering aura was so strong that it almost choked the nearby onlookers.\u201cSuch tremendous power! It\u2019s even stronger than Lei Ao\u2019s!\u201d\u201cPerhaps he can take down and wipe away Chu Kuangren\u2019s arrogant spirit\u2026\u201dFangtian, Yuanhong, and the others looked towards Shang Han with a ray of hope glimmering in their eyes.They were defeated by Chu Kuangren too harshly, hence all of them desperately hoped that someone could step out and take down Chu Kuangren now.\u201cI know you\u2019re strong since you killed Lei Ao. But you should not compare me with someone like him!\u201d Shang Han said indifferently.Opposite him, Chu Kuangren merely replied, \u201cIt makes no difference.\u201dSince Shang Han did not hesitate to show him hostility, then naturally, he need not do the same as well. Chu Kuangren\u2019s attitude of contempt towards him was clear.\u201cThe difference is great!\u201d Shang Han snorted coldly as rays of light started to gather and swirl around his hand. Then, a dark long spear with runes engraving appeared.A cold bitter surge of Daoist Rhyme immediately burst forth!\u201cTake this attack of mine, Soaring Waterfall Technique!\u201d The spear in Shang Han\u2019s grasp shook and out came a spear beam that blasted forward like a raging waterfall that rumbled the surrounding void.Chu Kuangren held his Self Descendant Sword and swung it lightly. An incredibly dominating purple sword ray instantly shot through the night sky and shattered the spear beam immediately.Then, the horribly terrifying sword beam instantly and forcefully pushed Shang Han dozens of feet back. His gaze became stern as he leaped high into the air, and when the spiritual power in his body had reached its peak limit, the turbulent Daoist Rhyme behind him formed into a fierce and strong wind.\u201cSage Technique, Nine-Day Storm Terror!\u201dThat attack was an extremely terrifying one.As the endless gusts of wind gathered on Shang Han\u2019s body, he then landed a single strike with his spear, releasing a pressure that could engulf the entire world!Fangtian, Yuanhong, Gu Changge, and the others looked up with faces full of hope. \u2018He can win. This attack has a chance to take Chu Kuangren down!\u2019\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique.\u201d A soft roar was heard. After that, a glistening purple sword ray rose from the ground like a dragon flying out of a mountain range. Within an instant, the strong winds and storms in the skies were ruptured by the sword ray before it landed on Shang Han\u2019s body.With a \u2018clang\u2019 sound, the spear fell off his grasps and plunged into the ground.At the same time, Shang Han was flung out of the sky like a piece of falling rag.\u201cI told you earlier, there\u2019s no difference.\u201d Chu Kuangren stood unmoved from his place. Up until that point, he had not moved a single step at all.The hopes that Fangtian, Yuanhong, and the others had shattered.\u201cAnother Young Emperor falls again,\u201d Fangtian said bitterly.1What were they hoping for?They were hoping for someone to appear and defeat Chu Kuangren\u2026However, how could such a thing ever happen?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Can\u2019t you be any more obvious with those insulting remarks?\u2019\u2018Isn\u2019t he only hostile towards you?\u2019\u2018Is there a need to humiliate him like this though?\u2019Everyone muttered within their hearts as they dared not speak out openly.Princess Linglong, who was beside the Royal Azure Dynasty King, looked at the dazzling white-robed Chu Kuangren with sparkles in her eyes.That was the man she would marry in the future and he truly was a peerless talent indeed!\u2018Which lady has never thought of being in love?\u2019\u2018Which lady has never wished or hoped that the person she chooses will be a strong and powerful hero?\u2019Although that marriage arrangement was based on a transaction of benefits, yet at that moment, sparks of affection started to grow within Princess Linglong\u2019s heart.\u2018In terms of talents and looks, my heavenly Chu Kuangren has it all\u2019\u2018He\u2019s the most unique in this world!\u2019Whoosh\u2026An elderly man flew to Shang Han\u2019s side. Picking up the Young Emperor in his arms, the elderly man asked, \u201cYoung Emperor, are you alright?\u201dLooking at the embarrassing mess Shang Han was in, the elderly man\u2019s heart was filled with shock.One should know that Shang Han himself was a Young Emperor!He was one of the most top-notched sky-prides on the Firmament Star. However, why would he end up in such a disgraceful manner before Chu Kuangren?\u2018That\u2019s impossible!\u2019The elderly man was confused and puzzled.Even Shang Han himself could not understand why as well. All these years, he had been a near-invincible person among his peers, so this was his first time experiencing the taste of defeat.Anger, dissatisfaction, shame, shock\u2026Various emotions riled up within his heart as he stared at Chu Kuangren as if he wanted to burn his opponent\u2019s face into his mind forever.\u201cJust you wait, I shall return for your head next time!\u201d Shang Han spoke ruthlessly and left the palace with the elderly man.The battle today had shattered all the pride he once had.However, he had also found a new goal because of that.\u2018I shall surpass Chu Kuangren!\u2019\u201cHis Daoist core is quite strong, unlike a certain crown prince I know of,\u201d Chu Kuangren casually said, with no intentions to kill off his opponent.Previously in the secret realm, it was Lei Ao who wanted to kill him first, whereas this time, it was just a simple sparring match. If he dealt a ruthless killing blow to Shang Han, the Shang Clan might not let him go that easily, unlike the Thunder Falcon Tribe. If an orthodoxy great war happened because of this, it would only bring harm to both sides.He did not deny that he was indeed a mad person sometimes.Even so, a mad person like him had a wide perspective and could see the bigger picture beyond what was happening.Not far away, Gu Changge was raging with fury when he heard Chu Kuangren\u2019s words. That \u2018certain crown prince\u2019 was definitely a reference to him.The banquet carried on after Shang Han\u2019s departure.Once it ended, each of the sky-prides then represented their respective orthodoxies and went into the royal treasury to choose their treasure.\u2026Inside the gardens behind the royal palace.The surrounding area was silent as only Chu Kuangren, Lan Yu, and Princess Linglong were there. None of them spoke while they took a quiet stroll through the gardens.\u201cFather has said that the wedding date will be up to us to decide. Since the fact that you are now the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess can\u2019t be changed anymore.\u201dPrincess Linglong was the first to speak up.\u201cYeah. So what\u2019s your view about this?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked.\u201cWe have only known each other for a few days. Whatever happened in the secret realm was done because we had no choice. However, I have to admit that I have some feelings for you, but it\u2019s only a little. I\u2019m still not sure as to whether I\u2019ve fallen for you or not.\u201dPrincess Linglong spoke earnestly.\u201cIt\u2019s the same for me as well. Although our marriage agreement is a transaction, both of us are soon to be husband and wife. I will fulfill my responsibilities as best as I can.\u201d\u201cAlright, so let\u2019s put the wedding date aside for now, do you have any plans for the future?\u201d Princess Linglong asked.\u201cThe reason I came down from the mountains was that I wanted to gain more experience and further train myself. Besides, I want to see the world as well.\u201dThe Firmament Star was a large world with a total of four domains. Chu Kuangren had not even finished exploring the Azure Dragon Domain, yet he already had plans to visit others.\u201cIt\u2019s to be expected. You are a dragon amongst men after all. There\u2019s no way the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s tiny piece of land can keep your interests for long.\u201d Princess Linglong was not surprised.After chatting for a while longer, both of them started to open up to each other and it pulled their relationship closer.The next day.Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu left the royal palace.Meanwhile, news of him becoming the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess had spread throughout the Capital City. Even the whole Azure Dragon Domain was shaken by the news.\u201cWh\u2026 Wh\u2026 What the d*mn hell? You\u2019re telling me that Chu Kuangren is now the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess, while the Royal Azure Dynasty and the Black Heaven Sect have now allied?\u201d\u201cIt seems that these two great sage orthodoxies intend to become Chu Kuangren\u2019s protector on his path of cultivation. By the gods, this is unprecedented news indeed.\u201d\u201cThe rise of Chu Kuangren\u2019s fame and power cannot be stopped by anyone!\u201d\u201cThe hell, Chu Kuangren himself already has a supreme heavenly form, and if someone like him gets the Godly Essence, how hopeless will everyone be?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s only Chu Kuangren in this era and if he wishes to become Emperor in the future, there\u2019ll be no hope for anyone else.\u201dWhile some people were shocked by the rapid rise of Chu Kuangren, others felt anxious and intimidated by the alliance between the two great sage orthodoxies.However, some were also saddened and enraged by the news.Such as the female cultivators from the Black Heaven Sect for instance.\u201cFianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess? Sobs, my Elder Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cMy god, how many lifetimes did Princess Linglong have to spend to gather such prosperous merits. I can\u2019t believe she can tie the knot with our Elder Senior Brother. I don\u2019t want to accept this!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t care, our Elder Senior Brother belongs to everyone.\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother, I shall give you my blessings.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t be sad my fellow sisters. Although our Elder Senior Brother will marry Princess Linglong, he will forever be our Elder Senior Brother.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, I still like our Elder Senior Brother. Even if he marries someone else, as long as I can secretly admire him from afar, then it\u2019s enough for me.\u201dThe news of Chu Kuangren\u2019s marriage saddened the female cultivators of the Black Heaven Sect for a few days. Rumors said that even Elder Ruyan was in a sad mood.Reportedly, someone spotted Elder Ruyan standing on a cliff overlooking the Royal Azure Dynasty with a sad expression, mumbling things like \u2018It\u2019s nice to be Princess Linglong\u2019 or \u2018My beloved didn\u2019t appear when I\u2019m young, but only appears when I\u2019m old\u2019.1\u2026At that time, Chu Kuangren had already left the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Capital City.With a fairy boat that he had procured from the Royal Azure Dynasty, he randomly chose a direction and traveled toward it. Even though he was traveling aimlessly, it was quite relaxed too.Only Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu were on the fairy boat. As for Li Xingchen, he had been ordered back to White Cloud City by his father Li Ye.In the Era of great battles, every sky-pride would put in the effort to improve themselves. Since Li Xingchen was naturally talented, Li Ye would never allow him to simply wander around like that.\u201cSo, my two fellow seniors, any ideas where I can go to gain more experiences?\u201d Atop the fairy boat, Chu Kuangren spoke as he turned to face the void behind him.He was speaking of those two. Besides the Seventh Forefather who had been secretly protecting him from the void, the Royal Azure Dynasty had also assigned a protector of their own as a sincere gesture to the alliance.\u201cThe Firmament Star is a large world. With us watching your backs, you\u2019re free to travel anywhere except the Ten Great Forbidden Areas,\u201d the Seventh Forefather said casually.The Ten Great Forbidden Areas he mentioned were the ten most dangerous places in the Firmament Star. It was rumored that even a sage might not come out alive once they went into a place like that.Although extremely curious, Chu Kuangren was not in a hurry to die just yet.1\u201cIt is said that you killed a sage and saved everyone in the Luminous Moon Secret Realm. Maybe you can take this opportunity to visit the other orthodoxies then.\u201d The voice of an old lady rang through the void. She was the protector sent forth by the Royal Azure Dynasty.Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes lit up upon hearing her words.Besides the Black Heaven Sect and Royal Azure Dynasty, there were still six other sage orthodoxies in the Azure Dragon Domain. Namely, they were the School of White Lotus, Five Ways Sect, Zhiyang Valley, Dharmas Sect, Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom, and Thunder Temple. Each of which had its own respective mysterious techniques and knowledge.Although his understanding of the Dao was extremely high, his understanding and knowledge about the art of techniques was still limited and was far worse than what he knew about the Dao. Perhaps he could take this chance to visit each of the sage orthodoxies to learn about their techniques and specialty.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go visit all these sage orthodoxies one by one. I hope they don\u2019t treat me with too less of a welcome.\u201dChu Kuangren smiled.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Differing from other sage orthodoxies, territories under the School of White Lotus were often heavily influenced by religious elements.Most of the inhabitants in the southern countries were devoted followers of the School of White Lotus, and it all began from a horrible turmoil that happened twenty thousand years ago.Legend had it that twenty thousand years ago, a demon had ascended from hell and caused widespread terrors in the southern countries. Countless lives were lost and many others lost their homes.It was a dark era that caused much blood and tears. Until this day, the event was still recorded in the history books of these southern countries.Then, out of nowhere, a Sage Ruler appeared and immediately sealed the demon under the Earth, saving countless lives from demise.The Sage Ruler was none other than the founder of the School of White Lotus, the White Lotus Sage Ruler!Although it had been centuries since the passing of the White Lotus Sage Ruler, his tales still resonated amongst the people in the southern countries. Many still worshipped him as a deity and held him close to their spiritual hearts.The School of White Lotus was also delighted at such an occurrence, so they did not hesitate to use it to leverage their influence.\u2026Full Moon Kingdom, the largest of all southern countries.It was where the headquarters of the School of White Lotus was at.Chu Kuangren was strolling along the streets of Full Moon Kingdom where the majority of the kingdom\u2019s residents dressed in all white. Very few dressed in other manners.Rumors had it that the White Lotus Sage Ruler was fond of the color white and loved to dress in that color. Since religion was the core of Full Moon Kingdom, it was no surprise that their residents had chosen to preserve this tradition.\u201cLan Yu, do you think it\u2019s unpleasant for me to visit this place empty-handed?\u201d Chu Kuangren stroked his chin and asked.It had been two days since the duo arrived. Chu Kuangren was taking his sweet time immersing himself in the local kingdom\u2019s cultures instead of making his visit to the School of White Lotus his priority.However, now that he had enough fun, it was time for business.\u201cWhy don\u2019t we buy some fruits?\u201d Chu Kuangren stopped at a fruit stall and nonchalantly bought its entire stocks.\u201cThank you, Master! Thank you!\u201dThe shopkeeper expressed his gratitude when he received his soulstones.\u201cI still don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough,\u201d Chu Kuangren murmured.The other shopkeepers who had been staring in envy immediately rushed forward and recommended their own fruits enthusiastically.\u201cMaster, these apples are not only huge and juicy, but their vibrant colors make them suitable props for joyous occasions. I also have grapes, pears, and\u2026\u201d\u201cMaster, my banana trees are watered using spiritual marrows. Look at them, do you think a typical banana would be this firm and straight?\u201d\u201cLook over here, Master\u2026\u201dCircled by a group of shopkeepers, Chu Kuangren let out a faint smile. Then, like a rich tycoon, he took out a large pile of soulstones and bought every single fruit from them.The Daoist Protectors, who were keeping watch from the shadows, were stunned at the sight.Was he bringing fruits to visit a sage orthodoxy?It was their first time witnessing such a gesture.The headquarters of the School of White Lotus.Inside a Grand Pagoda, a few elders were inspecting offerings that had been sent from all over the world.At that moment, a disciple walked in and announced, \u201cElder Hui, there\u2019s a cultivator called Chu Kuangren who\u2019s here to visit.\u201d\u201cWho?\u201d An elder was surprised.\u201cChu Kuangren.\u201dIn the School of White Lotus, many disciples had congregated together.They were staring curiously at Chu Kuangren, who had just arrived at the gate during that time. Some of the female disciples could not even move their eyes away from him.Some were even at the point of salivating.\u201cHe\u2019s Chu Kuangren, the most popular supreme sky-pride in the entire Firmament Star. I heard that even the Young Emperor couldn\u2019t be his match.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too handsome.\u201d\u201cPrincess Linglong is so lucky she could marry a person of his level. If it was me, I would probably wake up every morning with a smile on my face.\u201d\u201cIndeed.\u201d\u201cLook, he\u2019s staring this way. So handsome\u2026\u201dChu Kuangren was standing near the gate, waiting for someone to welcome him in.Soon, an elder with a white beard and white hair came forward. Chu Kuangren recognized the person as he was one of the Honorables who was present at the Secret Realm.\u201cBuddy Chu, you\u2019ve come to visit. It must be quite a distance for you.\u201d The elder smiled as he approached Chu Kuangren. However, deep down, he was secretly cursing at his guest. \u2018Why is this little b*stard suddenly at the School of White Lotus? What\u2019s his plan now?\u2019\u201cGreetings, sir. I\u2019ve come to accept your invitation to pay the School of White Lotus a visit. At the same time, perhaps we can even spar and learn from each other.\u201dChu Kuangren greeted the elder with a lighthearted smile.\u201cAccept my invitation?\u201dThe elder was confused. Since when did he extend an invitation to Chu Kuangren?\u201cExactly. You said at the Secret Realm that you would welcome me to visit the School of White Lotus at any time. Do you still remember?\u201d\u201cOf Course, of course.\u201dThe elder could finally recall.When Chu Kuangren killed the Black Light Sage in the Secret Realm, thus saving the various sage orthodoxies, the Honorables had thanked him excessively.Many had indicated that their doors would always be opened for Chu Kuangren to visit.However, those are merely polite words and nothing more.No one had actually thought that Chu Kuangren would visit within a few days\u2019 time.What else could the elder do?He could only welcome him now. After all, if word spread that he had closed his doors to Chu Kuangren, the entire of the Royal Azure Dynasty and the Black Heaven Sect would be after him.\u201cBuddy Chu, please come in.\u201dThe elder welcomed Chu Kuangren into the School of White Lotus.\u201cOh, I\u2019ve bought some gifts on the way here,\u201d Chu Kuangren said. Then, he took out several crates of fruits from his Yin and Yang ring. One after another, they appeared before the eyes of the crowds.The elder simpered for a moment.Chu Kuangren had actually bought crates of fruits as gifts for his visit to a sage orthodoxy.It was a courtesy that was completely unheard of in a cultivator\u2019s world.\u201cChu Kuangren, you\u2019re too generous.\u201dThe elder then ordered a few disciples to bring the fruits in.\u201cChu Kuangren!\u201d At that moment, a scream could be heard from far. At first glance, it was from a youngster whose face had changed drastically upon the sight of Chu Kuangren.Chu Kuangren looked over and recognized him as the White Lotus Bachelor Sage whose arm he chopped off. He smiled and said, \u201cHey, it\u2019s you, I hope you\u2019re doing well. Congratulations, I see that your arm has been rejoined to your body now.\u201dIn this world, there was always the possibility of rejoining a broken limb and even bringing someone back from the dead. With the resources that the School of White Lotus had, rejoining the White Lotus Bachelor Sage\u2019s arm was not a difficult task. All it needed was a little time for him to readjust.The White Lotus Bachelor Sage\u2019s face went pale upon hearing Chu Kuangren\u2019s remarks. He subconsciously felt a tingling pain on the spot where his arm was reconnected as Chu Kuangren\u2019s slash had left a traumatic impression on him.\u201cWhat a surprising moment to hear that you\u2019re paying us a visit, Brother Chu.\u201dThe White Lotus Maiden Sage had made an appearance too.\u201cGreetings, Maiden Sage.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve heard that you and Princess Linglong are getting wedded. In times like these, how do you have time to pay the School of White Lotus a visit instead of staying in the palace?\u201d\u201cWell, all good men have ambitions. How could I confine myself to that comfortable sanctuary all the time?\u201d Chu Kuangren answered nonchalantly.\u201cBrother Chu, you always do have great ambitions. Since you\u2019re here, how about we spar with each other?\u201d\u201cI have the same intention too.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded.The reason for his visit was to experience the School of White Lotus\u2019s cultivation techniques. Since the White Lotus Maiden Sage was the most impressive sky-pride amongst the youngest disciple, she was the perfect partner for Chu Kuangren to spar with.Soon, news of Chu Kuangren sparring with the White Lotus Maiden Sage spread throughout the School of White Lotus, shocking many disciples.Under a pavilion within the School of White Lotus.Chu Kuangren and the White Lotus Maiden Sage sat facing each other with their knees folded.\u201cMaiden Sage, my honor.\u201d\u201cThen I shall make the first move.\u201dThen, potent surges of Daoist Rhymes came gushing out of the White Lotus Maiden Sage\u2019s body as it charged towards Chu Kuangren.It was the purest channeling of Daoist Rhymes, with not a single pinch of spiritual powers mixed within. While tactical, these Daoist Rhymes did not pack the power to inflict fatal injuries.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 77": "Chapter 77: Defeating Countless Techniques With A Single Sword, The Legendary Trait Meditational ClarityIn the pavilion within the School of White Lotus.The White Lotus Maiden Sage sat with her knees folded while sparring with Chu Kuangren in complete silence, as her Daoist Rhymes thickened the atmosphere around her. Gradually, a string of Daoist Rhymes began to manifest around Chu Kuangren\u2019s body as well.As usual, his Daoist Rhymes were unprecedentedly sharp and powerful.It resembled the glory of a divine sword!The two different strings of Daoist Rhymes intersected midair and collided directly into each other.\u201cThere are three popular techniques that the School of White Lotus practice. These are the Supreme White Lotus Chant, the Light of Purification, and the White Rainbow Charge!\u201d\u201cBrother Chu, it is much obliged that you first witness my White Rainbow Charge.\u201dThe White Lotus Maiden Sage said calmly.Then, the Maiden Sage\u2019s Daoist Rhymes began to spin wildly in the air. All of a sudden, it morphed into the shape of a figure that abruptly attacked Chu Kuangren with both its palms.The crowd was astounded at the sight of that phenomenon.\u201cHow deserving of her to be the Maiden Sage, to have mastered the White Rainbow Charge technique at such a level. I\u2019m not surprised if her skills could even rival some of the elders.\u201d\u201cIndeed, it\u2019s very admirable.\u201d\u201cI too would love to sit and spar with the Maiden Sage.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re fantasizing too much now.\u201dEveryone was focusing intently on what was unfolding in the pavilion.At that moment, Chu Kuangren\u2019s Daoist Rhymes began to condense and form into a Sword of the Heaven before it ejected a stream of sword rays.Like a rainbow, the sword rays curved over and instantly tore the White Rainbow Charge apart.\u201cWhat an impressive sword Dao.\u201dDeep down, the White Lotus Maiden Sage was shocked but one after another, she unleashed the various techniques of the School of White Lotus. For a moment, the air was painted in a wide array of colors, creating a glamorous sight for all to witness.However, no matter which technique the White Lotus Maiden Sage resorted to, her technique was immediately broken by a single stream of sword rays from Chu Kuangren\u2019s Sword of the Heaven!\u201cHow strong! Chu Kuangren really lives up to his name.\u201d\u201cAm I witnessing the glamour of a supreme sky-pride?\u201d\u201cHow deep is his understanding of sword Dao? This is terrifying.\u201dChu Kuangren had defeated countless techniques with a single sword!His style had rendered everyone beyond speechless!\u201cLight of Purification!\u201d When the White Lotus Maiden Sage realized that she had not been able to breach Chu Kuangren\u2019s defense for a while now, she resorted to another signature technique of the School of White Lotus.Streams of white lights exploded gloriously like it was cleansing the world from all its pollutants and contaminants as it headed towards Chu Kuangren.\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique!\u201d Chu Kuangren let out a soft roar.The Sword of the Heaven jerked abruptly before a wave of purple sword rays poured out like a tsunami and penetrated the white light, completely disintegrating the Daoist Rhymes that were contained within.As the White Lotus Maiden Sage\u2019s Daoist Rhymes began to disperse, she took a deep breath and said gently, \u201cLooks like I\u2019ve lost this sparring match.\u201dNeither her techniques nor skills were a match against Chu Kuangren\u2019s.\u201cThe Maiden Sage has lost?\u201d\u201cSigh, what to do? After all, it\u2019s Chu Kuangren she\u2019s fighting against!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s too impressive.\u201d\u2026A few figures could be seen peeping at the pavilion throughout the fight.They were the elders of the School of White Lotus. Since the beginning of the match, these elders had been keeping a close eye on what was happening and they were not surprised at all that the White Lotus Maiden Sage was defeated.The elders understood just how strong Chu Kuangren was.If he was capable of defeating a Young Emperor, what more the White Lotus Maiden Sage?\u201cAlthough this youngster has relied on that single sword to defeat all her techniques, what\u2019s impressive is that his skills are still in a rudimentary stage. Once this skill has developed to its fullest, I cannot imagine how terrifying his powers will become!\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren, what a remarkable individual.\u201dThe few elders of the School of White Lotus were exchanging their thoughts through telepathy. They were all in awe of Chu Kuangren\u2019s display of skill sets.Meanwhile, in the pavilion, Chu Kuangren had also recollected his Daoist Rhymes. He had gained a new set of knowledge about the School of White Lotus\u2019s techniques from this sparring session.\u201cThe whole purpose of a spar is to learn from one another. If one merely obsesses over the victory, that would be extremely disgraceful,\u201d Chu Kuangren said softly.\u201cBrother Chu, your words make a lot of sense.\u201d The White Lotus Maiden Sage gently adjusted her attire.After that, she proceeded to arrange a guest room for both Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu. The duo had planned to spend a few more days in the School of White Lotus.The early morning of the next day.Chu Kuangren woke up and spun the Fantasy Roulette as usual.He did not harbor much hope that he would earn something useful. After all, he had just recently gotten the Treasure Locating Skill.\u201cCongratulations, host. You\u2019ve won a Legendary Trait, Meditational Clarity.\u201dWhat?Chu Kuangren doubted his own hearings.Legendary?Did he just win another legendary grade item?\u201cImpossible, that\u2019s impossible, totally impossible.\u201d Chu Kuangren opened the Roulette room and saw a white orb lying within.There was also a caption beside it\u2026 Legendary Trait Meditational Clarity!Chu Kuangren was astounded.However, he soon rejoiced in a smile. \u2018Wow, this was huge!\u2019He had just drawn the Treasure Locating Skill a few days ago, and today, he had earned himself a legendary trait. This made Chu Kuangren overwhelmed with a sense of surrealism.\u201cAcquire Meditational Clarity,\u201d Chu Kuangren murmured.Then, a gush of peculiar sensation rushed into his mind. Chu Kuangren closed his eyes and indulged in that newfound sensation.When Chu Kuangren opened his eyes once more, the entire world no longer felt the same.The world felt much clearer now. It was not that he could now see better, but rather, his understanding and intuition towards the material world were now enhanced.Meditational Clarity was an intelligence trait that would allow Chu Kuangren to quickly and conveniently learn the various techniques that existed in this world.Chu Kuangren was already an intelligent person. Yet now that he could leverage on the effect of the Meditational Clarity, it was hard to imagine just how far he could take his limits.Once the initial excitements faded, Chu Kuangren exited his room and stretched his hands as he bathed himself in the warm sunlight. \u201cWow, what a beautiful day!\u201d\u201cMaster,\u201d Lan Yu greeted. She had initially come to wake Chu Kuangren up but was weirded out by how different he was behaving this morning instead.\u201cCough. Good morning, Lan Yu.\u201d\u201cGood morning, Master.\u201dUnder the guidance of a servant, the duo then went on to have their breakfasts.Later on, like a tour guide, the White Lotus Maiden Sage brought Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu around the place. It almost seemed like they were on a fun vacation.\u2026The trio arrived at the base of a mountain wall.The mountain wall\u2019s surface was so smooth, it resembled that of a polished mirror. There was even an enormous mural etched onto the wall \u2014 it was the picture of a white lotus. Under the warm glow of sunlight, the mural almost seemed as if it was coming alive.There were also several School of White Lotus\u2019s disciples before the mountain wall, who were scratching their heads as they stared intently at the mural.Chu Kuangren had also noticed the White Lotus Bachelor Sage present amongst the crowd.\u201cWhat are they doing here?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked.\u201cAccording to a legend, our founding forefather, the White Lotus Sage Ruler had invented the supreme Sage Ruler Technique, the White Lotus Light of Purification before this very mural. These disciples are hoping to achieve the same realization as their forefathers,\u201d said the White Lotus Maiden Sage.\u201cWill an imitation like this work?\u201d Chu Kuangren was surprised. If it was that simple to mimic a Sage Ruler\u2019s technique, the world would have been filled with Sage Rulers.\u201cBrother Chu, there\u2019s something you don\u2019t know. This mountain wall is different from the rest. It contains the remnants of Daoist Rhymes that were left by our forefather. The insights for the School of White Lotus\u2019s three most popular techniques were all discovered at this exact spot. However, the techniques which we had intuited are only a fragment of what it once was \u2014 no more than ten percent,\u201d the White Lotus Maiden Sage lamented.Chu Kuangren nodded. \u201cI see.\u201dSince Chu Kuangren\u2019s interest was aroused, he walked forward to observe the mountain wall.Upon noticing his arrival, the crowd soon engaged in discussions.\u201cIt\u2019s Chu Kuangren. What\u2019s he doing here? Is he intending to gain insights into the White Lotus Light of Purification that was left by our forefather?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nonsense. He\u2019s not even a part of the School of White Lotus and has never been exposed to the core teachings of our school. It\u2019s impossible for him to gain any insights into the technique.\u201d\u201cEver since the passing of our forefather, the White Lotus Light of Purification\u2019s full technique had since been gone too. Many generations of disciples in the School of White Lotus have attempted to gain that insight from this mountain wall, but none have succeeded. It\u2019s unlikely that he\u2019ll be the one who does.\u201dThe White Lotus Bachelor Sage approached Chu Kuangren and said, \u201cHow\u2019s it going to be, Brother Chu? Would you like to give it a try and see if you\u2019ll manage to gain any insights into the White Lotus Light of Purification\u2019s full technique?\u201dOf course, it was not a sincere invitation at all. The Bachelor Sage merely assumed that Chu Kuangren would never succeed and wanted to embarrass him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Chu Kuangren would never miss out on such an opportunity.\u201cLet\u2019s see.\u201d Chu Kuangren smiled faintly as he took a few gentle steps towards the mountain wall. As he stared at the mural on the wall, he could feel his entire spirit immersed within the art.The White Lotus Bachelor Sage observed Chu Kuangren\u2019s posture and let out a condescending sneer. \u201cWhat a joke. As a generational sky-pride of the School of White Lotus, even I couldn\u2019t unravel the insights to the White Lotus Light of Purification despite having spent countless years at it. What makes you think a foreigner like you would succeed?\u201dThe White Lotus Light of Purification could be said to be the source of all cultivation techniques in the School of White Lotus. Even a generational sky-pride would only be able to discover a fragment of the technique\u2019s insight after spending years mastering the other techniques that were taught in the School of White Lotus.However, Chu Kuangren was not a disciple of the School of White Lotus and had never been exposed to their techniques before. So how could it be possible for him to learn the White Lotus Light of Purification then?\u201cDo you actually think that there\u2019s nothing you can\u2019t do?\u201dThe White Lotus Bachelor Sage mocked.The rest of the crowd felt that Chu Kuangren was attempting the impossible too. However, that did not stop them from watching as they kept a close eye on Chu Kuangren, waiting for the moment he would embarrass himself.Yet, they soon noticed that something weird had happened.As Chu Kuangren focused on the mural, his body soon began to radiate a mythical flow of Daoist Rhymes and a white glow surrounded his body, giving out warmth and purity.\u201cThis Daoist Rhyme\u2026 It\u2019s the Light of Purification!\u201d The White Lotus Maiden Sage was visibly shocked. Having practiced hard on the Light of Purification technique, it was easy for her to pick up on the Daoist Rhyme.However, why did such Daoist Rhyme appear around Chu Kuangren\u2019s body?What was happening exactly?The White Lotus Maiden Sage was already clueless, what more the rest.\u201cChu Kuangren, what\u2019s happening?\u201d The White Lotus Bachelor Sage asked nervously as he sensed that something unfavorable was about to happen.Just when he was about to step forward, Lan Yu took a leap forward and blocked his path. \u201cMaster is gaining insights into a technique. No one is allowed to disturb him.\u201dWith an intimidating demeanor, Lan Yu\u2019s cold gaze swept across everyone at the scene. Her silver-white armor had long been equipped on her body as she prepared herself for a possible battle.\u201cNo one is allowed to disturb Brother Chu.\u201dThe White Lotus Maiden Sage said.Her eyes were beaming with excitement. She had previously attempted to gain insights from the mural but yielded no results. Could Chu Kuangren do it?\u2026The mural on the mountain wall was no longer an ordinary mural. The petals of the white lotus, its engravings, and roots were now enriched with a mythical flow of Daoist Rhymes. It was warm, pure, and magnificent at the same time.Gradually, Chu Kuangren ascended into an ethereal state.In an instant, the material world vanished before Chu Kuangren\u2019s perspective, and what was left was a clear vision and understanding of the Daoist Rhymes.Meditational Clarity!Chu Kuangren went into the state of Meditational Clarity to swiftly decipher the Daoist Rhymes that were engraved on the mural and the inner workings of a technique soon appeared within Chu Kuangren\u2019s mind.Suddenly, Chu Kuangren could see a middle-aged woman suspending mid-air as she sat with her knees folded. She was smiling faintly as her fingers were folded into the shape of a seal. Around her, white lotuses appeared and each flower contained an enriched stream of Daoist Rhymes.If Chu Kuangren was right, this person was none other than the White Lotus Sage Ruler.In the material world.The Daoist Rhymes that were dancing around Chu Kuangren grew stronger as its radius of effect expanded, comprising half of the entire School of White Lotus\u2019 headquarters.Many warriors within the headquarters were shocked by it.\u201cIs this the Light of Purification\u2019s Daoist Rhymes? No, it feels even more complete and mythical than the Light of Purification. Could it be\u2026 Let\u2019s take a look.\u201d\u201cSo many years have passed. Is it finally the time that a sky-pride has gained full insights into the White Lotus Light of Purification\u2019s complete technique?!\u201d\u201cHaha, God bless the School of White Lotus.\u201dSeveral of the school\u2019s elders rushed to the scene.Upon noticing Chu Kuangren who was radiating the stream of mythical Daoist rhymes before the mountain wall, they were all shocked.How could it be him?!\u201cMaiden Sage, what\u2019s happening?\u201d one of the elders asked.The White Lotus Maiden Sage then narrated the story from the beginning.The crowd looked at each other, murmuring. They were all visibly incredulous towards what was unfolding.Was it all a joke?Despite having spent countless years trying to gain insights into the technique, the School of White Lotus had yet to succeed. Could a foreigner just swoop in and succeed now?\u201cIf Chu Kuangren is successful, what should we do?\u201d an elder asked worriedly.\u201cLet\u2019s not rush to a conclusion first. He\u2019s still searching for the insights, who knows it could just be a fragment of the Light of Purification,\u201d another elder replied.The results between a fragmented technique and a complete technique were totally different. Although it would be shocking if Chu Kuangren had managed to learn the White Lotus Light of Purification\u2019s fragmented technique, it was still considered acceptable.However, trouble would lie ahead if Chu Kuangren had managed to gain insights into the full technique of the White Lotus Light of Purification!The White Lotus Light of Purification was the source of all techniques in the School of White Lotus, hence mastering this technique would mean that one could defeat all the remaining techniques of the School of White Lotus with ease.If such power was to lie in one of their disciple\u2019s hands, it would still be acceptable. However, the consequences would be grave should an enemy acquire that ability!To put it bluntly, it was an issue that concerned the life and death of the orthodoxy!The group of elders stared deadly at Chu Kuangren, in hopes that he would only manage to acquire a fragment of that technique. They did not wish to concede control over to Chu Kuangren.It was a grueling feeling.Someone amongst the crowd had tried to intercept Chu Kuangren. However, the auras from the two Supreme Honorables, that were hidden amongst the void, were too oppressive that they did not dare follow through with their actions.Buzz\u2026Just then, the space surrounding Chu Kuangren began to shake violently before beams of bright, white lights exploded and a garden of white lotuses began to materialize in the air.The phenomenon spread upwards into the sky and covered the entire firmament!All the cultivators in the School of White Lotus could see what was happening.At that moment, everyone felt as if their cultivations were suppressed. Even the Honorable realms cultivators were not spared from that feeling.The elders swallowed their salivas as shock appeared across their faces.\u201cIt\u2019s the complete technique of the White Lotus Light of Purification!\u201d\u201cHe has really gained full insights into the White Lotus Light of Purification!\u201d\u201cMy God\u2026\u201dIt was a shocking event for the entire School of White Lotus.Even the citizens who were living near the School of White Lotus were witnessing the peculiar phenomenon.\u201cLook, it\u2019s the White Lotus Purification!\u201d\u201cCould it be that the White Lotus Sage Ruler had been reborn?\u201d\u201cAll hail the Sage Ruler! Long live the Sage Ruler!\u201dCountless believers who worshipped the White Lotus Sage Ruler started to kneel on the ground and rejoice in his name as they cheered with the greatest devotions.In the School of White Lotus, the cultivators were staring at Chu Kuangren in shock.The techniques that they had cultivated had all come from the White Lotus Light of Purification. However, now that Chu Kuangren had acquired this technique, the influence of his Daoist Rhymes had quickly created an instinctual response amongst these cultivators to worship him.\u201cMy God, he\u2019s done it.\u201d\u201cWhile the School of White Lotus\u2019s sky-prides have failed even after countless years in deciphering the technique, Chu Kuangren has done it all by himself.\u201d\u201cNot only that, but he\u2019s done it in such a short period of time\u2026\u201d\u201cThis guy\u2019s too horrifying!\u201dAll of the School of White Lotus, from the lowly disciples to the bachelor and maiden sages, and to the respectable elders; they were all dumbfounded.Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren steadily lifted himself out of the state of Meditational Clarity, and soon, the White Lotus Purification phenomenon around him vanished.\u201cA Sage Ruler Technique indeed. It\u2019s not much weaker than Avarice techniques, or perhaps in some ways, the Sage Ruler Technique is even stronger. Looks like I\u2019m one step closer to Emperor technique now.\u201dChu Kuangren murmured satisfyingly.It was a huge advantage for him to acquire this Sage Ruler Technique.\u201cQuick, surround him now.\u201dOne of the elders commanded.A group of Honorables rushed forward and encircled Chu Kuangren.Between the empty space, the Seventh Forefather and an old woman appeared out of thin air. They emitted a frightening aura of the Supreme Honorables as they stared coldly at their surroundings.\u201cWhat are all of you trying to do?\u201d Seventh Forefather said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

If any of them dared make a move, they would immediately retaliate.Some Honorables hesitated to make a move in face of the Supreme Honorables, and with that, they could not do much but stare at Chu Kuangren helplessly.Not even in their dreams would they have thought that someone would acquire the complete technique for the White Lotus Light of Purification.However, when that person was not from the School of White Lotus, the elders could no longer just sit and watch. After all, it was related to the survival of an entire sage orthodoxy!How could they cede so much control to a foreigner?\u201cStop right there.\u201d At that moment, the voice of a woman was heard. From the void, a middle-aged woman dressed in white robes stepped out of the immaterial realm.The Daoist symbols under Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes began to blink.\u201cBai Qing, the leader of the School of White Lotus. Supreme Honorable cultivators\u2026\u201dHis actions had even surprised the leader of the school.\u2018Perhaps things have gotten out of control.\u2019Chu Kuangren thought to himself.\u201cGreetings, leader.\u201dThe crowd hastily bowed in respect. The White Lotus Leader came before Chu Kuangren and looked him in the eyes, \u201cBrother Chu, can you describe the details of how you\u2019ve come to acquire the White Lotus Light of Purification?\u201d\u201cI looked at the mural and then I gained these insights.\u201dChu Kuangren said faintly.The crowd immediately grimaced upon hearing Chu Kuangren\u2019s reply.Was he kidding? The School of White Lotus had poured unlimited blood and sweat into this and still failed, yet Chu Kuangren had done the impossible by just looking at the mural?Was there anything more humiliating than this?\u201cThe mural contained Daoist Rhymes that were left by our foremother and it represented the White Lotus Light of Purification. This technique could only be understood spiritually but not taught orally. Aside from our foremother, no other person has managed to do it until today.\u201d\u201cBrother Chu, your intelligence is impressive! How admirable.\u201dThe White Lotus Leader lamented.Although she was disappointed, she knew that a technique like the White Lotus Light of Purification could never be obtained through brute force.\u201cBuddy Chu, I have a favor to ask from you and I hope you agree.\u201dThe White Lotus Leader said.\u201cWhat is it, senior?\u201d\u201cI would like you to become a School of White Lotus\u2019s Bachelor Sage.\u201dThe entire crowd immediately went into an uproar upon hearing the leader\u2019s request.\u201cLet Chu Kuangren become the White Lotus Bachelor Sage? How\u2019s this possible!\u201d\u201cWhat is our leader thinking?\u201dThe expression on the White Lotus Bachelor Sage\u2019s face changed and he opposed the leader\u2019s suggestion, \u201cLeader, please do not let him be. Chu Kuangren has stolen the Sage Ruler Technique from the School of White Lotus and must be held accountable for it. Why are you letting him become a White Lotus Bachelor Sage?\u201dHe had long disliked Chu Kuangren, so he naturally refused to see him gain any advantages.However, the White Lotus Leader said, \u201cThis mountain wall has been here for the past twenty thousand years. Anyone could come and try to gain its insights, but it\u2019s just a matter of who\u2019s qualified enough to succeed. How could you say that he\u2019s stolen it from us?\u201d\u201cWhat more, Buddy Chu is naturally talented and he has learned the White Lotus Light of Purification. I would say that he may even be overqualified to be a White Lotus Bachelor Sage.\u201dThe White Lotus Leader had made her decision, with her mind long set on Chu Kuangren.The few elders aside were equally puzzled too, but they did not object further.The White Lotus Light of Purification was too big of a deal to fool around with. If they could not get rid of Chu Kuangren, the alternative was to form a diplomatic relationship with him.Obviously, the former choice had too big of a price to pay.Chu Kuangren was the Elder Senior Brother of Black Heaven Sect and the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess. If they chose to kill him, these two sage orthodoxies would surely make them pay.The latter choice was evidently more preferable.To make Chu Kuangren\u2026 one of their own.That way, they did not need to worry about Chu Kuangren defeating them using their own White Lotus Light of Purification. Besides, they could even gain another excellent Bachelor Sage in the process.It was killing two birds with one stone!The elders could now see the reason behind their leader\u2019s decision.\u201cIt\u2019s an enticing gesture. However, I\u2019m already the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect, so I\u2019m afraid that I cannot accept your offer.\u201dChu Kuangren said.\u201cLooks like you worry about Black Heaven Sect. Rest assured, I\u2019ll have a proper discussion with your Honorable Teacher. You should stay here for a few more days. If you have any other requests, please let me know, and I\u2019ll try my best to fulfill them,\u201d the White Lotus Leader said.\u201cWell\u2026 Alright then.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded.After all, he did not plan to leave soon as well. Staying a few more days there would do him no harm.\u2026Black Heaven Sect.Honourable Xuan Qi was sitting in front of a stele.The stele was none other than the Dao stele, and engraved on it was the Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique which Chu Kuangren had previously invented in the library.Ever since Chu Kuangren descended into the Earthly Realm, Honourable Xuan Qi had been incessantly studying the sword technique. Although he had yet fully mastered it, Honourable Xuan Qi now had a general grasp of the move.Every day while he studied the technique, Honourable Xuan Qi would lament about how a destructive Sage Ruler Technique was actually created in the hands of a young disciple.Each time he thought about it, Honourable Xuan Qi would feel a sense of pride.After all, Chu Kuangren, who was excellent and talented in every way, was actually his disciple!Even the Sage Ruler Technique was named by himself.\u201cEhh\u2026\u201dSuddenly, a strange expression was written across Honourable Xuan Qi\u2019s face.Not far away, he could see a white lotus coming towards him and when it was before him, it immediately bloomed into an elegant lady in a white robe.\u201cHonourable Xuan Qi, long time no see.\u201dThe lady was none other than the White Lotus Leader.\u201cWow, what a rare sight to see the White Lotus Leader here. You\u2019ve come tens of thousands of miles to see me, what is it for?\u201d Honourable Xuan Qi laughed lightly and said.They were cultivators of the same generation who had interacted frequently when they were younger, so this meeting somewhat resembled a reunion between two old friends.\u201cIt\u2019s about Chu Kuangren,\u201d the White Lotus Leader softly replied.Honourable Xuan Qi\u2019s face became solemn. \u201cPlease elaborate.\u201dThen, the White Lotus Leader explained her intention to make Chu Kuangren a Bachelor Sage, narrating each detail of how Chu Kuangren had managed to gain insights into the full technique of White Lotus Light of Purification.When she was finished, even Honourable Xuan Qi was left in awe.He soon let out a light peal of laughter. \u201cThat\u2019s great. He\u2019s indeed my disciple, unique and unprecedented in his own way.\u201dThe White Lotus Leader rolled her eyes. Deep down, she was also envious of Honourable Xuan Qi to have such a marvelous disciple.If only Chu Kuangren was her disciple to begin with.\u201cAlright, let\u2019s talk business. Chu Kuangren possesses a very unique talent. Do you think it\u2019s enough if he\u2019s only protected by the Black Heaven Sect and Royal Azure Dynasty? Why not let the School of White Lotus join in as well?\u201dThe White Lotus Leader simply suggested.\u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s there to consider? Only good will come out of such a decision. If Chu Kuangren has the protection from three major sage orthodoxies, no one would dare to touch him at least within Azure Dragon Domain.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll have a discussion with the Royal Azure Dynasty.\u201dHonourable Xuan Qi then reached out to the Royal Azure Dynasty King and they both had a prompt discussion.At last, the two major sage orthodoxies agreed with the request from the School of White Lotus. With Chu Kuangren in the middle, the three major sage orthodoxies could also form an alliance on some level by finding a common opportunity to grow together.\u201cI\u2019ll let Kuangren know about this.\u201d\u201cGreat, then I shall make a move first.\u201d Then, the White Lotus Leader vanished on the spot.With that, Honourable Xuan Qi was left alone in his place. He lamented, \u201cThree major sage orthodoxies offering their protections to a single person\u2026 Such an event must\u2019ve never occurred before in history.\u201d\u2026In the School of White Lotus, Chu Kuangren received Honourable Xuan Qi\u2019s telepathic message, where he was asked if he was willing to become a White Lotus Bachelor Sage.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to do much. For the moment it\u2019s only a title. You can continue on your journey to train yourself,\u201d Honourable Xuan Qi said.\u201cSure.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded his head, agreeing with the School of White Lotus\u2019s request.After all, there would be no harm in having an extra title to his name and he could enjoy the protection from three major sage orthodoxies. If even Honourable Xuan Qi had agreed on it, he had no reason to decline.Just like that, Chu Kuangren was not only the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother and the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess, but he now had an extra title to his name.The White Lotus Bachelor Sage!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

So they had always thought of Chu Kuangren as an absolutely evil person.Yet now, the evil person was soon becoming their Bachelor Sage?It was so dramatic.\u201cChu Kuangren has become our Bachelor Sage. I don\u2019t know what the leader and the rest are thinking. This is a mess.\u201d\u201cYou must know that Chu Kuangren has gained insights into the White Lotus Light of Purification. It\u2019ll be difficult to not make him a Bachelor Sage.\u201d\u201cRight? This is too surreal for me.\u201d\u201cThroughout generations, our sky-prides have all attempted but failed at acquiring the White Lotus Purification, so how did Chu Kuangren manage to do it like that?\u201d\u201cExactly\u2026\u201dThe disciples of the School of White Lotus were discussing passionately.A group of female cultivators was gathering in a circle, with one of them saying, \u201cDo you think Chu Kuangren will look like a barbarian?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think so. I heard that his features resemble that of an immortal.\u201d\u201cThose are probably just rumors. Good looking people are just like fairytales nowadays,\u201d another female cultivator said pessimistically.Then, gasps of excitement could soon be heard amongst the crowd.\u201cCome look, it\u2019s Chu Kuangren.\u201d\u201cIndeed, he looks different and unique from the rest.\u201dSeveral female cultivators looked over and saw an immortal-resembling Chu Kuangren walk past the crowd with Lan Yu.\u201cWow, he looks exactly like what was described in the rumors. Nay, he\u2019s even better looking than that.\u201d\u201cI agree. He\u2019s so handsome.\u201dThe female cultivator who had previously dissed Chu Kuangren was completely dumbfounded. It was not until Chu Kuangren had left that she finally recovered to her senses.\u201cI hereby announce that from today onwards, I fully pledge my support for Chu Kuangren to be our Bachelor Sage. Anyone who opposes that decision shall face my wrath!\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201dChu Kuangren was taking Lan Yu along for a tour around the School of White Lotus. Little did he know that he had earned himself a wider fanbase through a simple stroll around the compound.\u2026The grand hall of the School of White Lotus.The White Lotus Leader was smiling with contempt at an elegant white robe before her. She turned to Chu Kuangren and said, \u201cThis is the attire for the grand conferral ceremony. Try on and see if you have any comments on it.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m okay with any arrangements, senior,\u201d Chu Kuangren said with a gentle smile.After all, he was handsome enough to look good in any attire.\u201cAlright. Once the grand conferral ceremony is over, I\u2019ll make an announcement to the public. From there onwards, you will have the protection from three major sage orthodoxies.\u201dThe White Lotus Leader smiled plainly, but a hint of disbelief flashed across her eyes.Three major sage orthodoxies were protecting the same person.This had never happened before in history.\u201cThank you, leader.\u201dSoon came the grand conferral ceremony of the School of White Lotus.In the Capital of Full Moon Kingdom laid a huge platform. It was where the grand conferral ceremony was to take place, where Chu Kuangren would be officially made a Bachelor Sage in the presence of countless disciples!On the large platform, the Ruler of Full Moon Kingdom and the White Lotus Leader each took their seats as countless disciples crowded the streets.They were all excitedly anticipating the appearance of their new Bachelor Sage.\u201cI heard that the new Bachelor Sage has gained full insights into the cultivation technique that was left by a Sage Ruler. I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s true, but I\u2019m excited.\u201d\u201cOf course it\u2019s true. Two days ago, we all witnessed the white lotuses crowding the sky. There\u2019s no way that the phenomenon was faked.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d\u201cI agree. In the past, no one was able to decipher the technique that was left by the Sage Ruler. Fortunately, we now have a successor.\u201dThe crowd was actively discussing the matter.Due to the incident two days ago where white lotuses were seen crowding the entire firmament, the crowd was especially excited about this grand conferral ceremony.On the platform, the royally-dressed Ruler of Full Moon Kingdom asked curiously, \u201cLeader, did this Bachelor Sage really learn the technique that was left behind by the Sage Ruler?\u201dThe White Lotus Leader gently nodded.The Ruler of Full Moon Kingdom was initially shocked but a burst of joyful laughter soon followed. He lamented, \u201cFinally, a successor to the Sage Ruler.\u201d\u201cYes, he\u2019s an unprecedentedly excellent young man.\u201dThe White Lotus Leader smiled.\u201cHere he is, he\u2019s coming!\u201dExcited screams could be heard amongst the crowd, and soon, a male figure appeared from the end of the street, followed by a female figure.The male figure was none other than Chu Kuangren. He was dressed in a marvelous white robe with a jade crown on his head, and his feet were in jade white shoes. His demeanor was graceful and resembled that of an immortal.Meanwhile, Lan Yu followed closely behind him while dressed in her silver-white armor. Her wings were spread out as her hands held onto the Scepter of Light, symbolizing the Divine intent.At that moment, the entire street fell into pitch silence.All eyes were on the two of them.\u201cPlay the music!\u201d the White Lotus Leader instructed from the platform.From the side, two people were seen blowing into a horn before the solemn ceremonial music resonated throughout the firmament.Chu Kuangren radiated a surge of mythical Daoist Rhyme. With each step that he took, a white lotus bloomed under his footsteps.With the blossoming of each flower, the street was soon covered entirely in white lotuses!\u201cIt\u2019s the Sage Ruler\u2019s White Lotus Purification!\u201d\u201cIs he the incarnation of the Sage Ruler?\u201d\u201cAll hail the Bachelor Sage.\u201dCountless disciples who were spiritual followers of the White Lotus Sage Ruler immediately kowtowed upon witnessing the White Lotus Purification.At that instance, Chu Kuangren looked like the incarnation of the White Lotus Sage Ruler who had suppressed the hell demon and liberated countless lives out of torment twenty thousand years ago. Hence, they worshipped him like a God!Behind him, Lan Yu also bore the same emotions as those disciples when she looked at Chu Kuangren.To her, Chu Kuangren deserved to be at the top. He deserved to be respected and worshipped by billions of people!The White Lotus Maiden Sage and a few Bachelor Sages watched from afar, but they then looked at each other and let out a bitter laugh.They did not enjoy the same treatment when they were granted their titles previously.\u201cAlthough we are both Bachelor Sages, there\u2019s no doubt that Chu Kuangren outranks us by a mile,\u201d one of the Bachelor Sages said.\u201cWell, he did acquire the White Lotus White of Purification after all.\u201d\u201cMaiden Sage, now that Chu Kuangren has risen up the rank and has also learned the White Lotus Light of Purification, are you not afraid that he would pose a threat to you?\u201dOne of the Bachelor Sages asked the Maiden Sage curiously.The White Lotus Maiden Sage shook her head. \u201cHe won\u2019t.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cThe main reason our leader granted him the title of Bachelor Sage is that he had learned the White Lotus Light of Purification technique. However, he\u2019s still the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect, so our leader will not grant him too much power.\u201dThe White Lotus Maiden Sage could read the situation clearly. Although Chu Kuangren was now a Bachelor Sage, he was still different from the School of White Lotus\u2019s pure disciples.\u201cFurthermore, Chu Kuangren wouldn\u2019t even pay much attention to the School of White Lotus. With his abilities, he\u2019ll soon have a bigger stage to dance on!\u201dThe White Lotus Maiden Sage explained calmly.Chu Kuangren\u2019s abilities were too remarkable. If someone of this generation was meant to ascend into an Emperor, Chu Kuangren would no doubt stand a great chance.At least, it was more probably him than any of them.The School of White Lotus would bear no significance to Chu Kuangren\u2019s future at all as he would only have more to lose if he confined himself to the School of White Lotus.\u2026Once he had walked past the street, Chu Kuangren slowly stepped onto the platform.The Ruler of Full Moon Kingdom hastily greeted him and said in awe, \u201cBachelor Sage, you are undoubtedly different from the rest.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s begin the grand conferral ceremony.\u201d The White Lotus Leader retrieved a crown that resembled a lotus and placed it above Chu Kuangren\u2019s head.Then, she announced loudly to the disciples, \u201cI hereby announce that from today onwards, Chu Kuangren is the School of White Lotus\u2019s Bachelor Sage!\u201d\u201cAll hail the Bachelor Sage!\u201d\u201cAll hail the Bachelor Sage!\u201d\u201cAll hail the Bachelor Sage!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

It had startled many cultivators and orthodoxies.Everyone was dumbfounded.\u2018A few days ago Chu Kuangren had just become the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess. How many days has it been since then? Why is he now a White Lotus Bachelor Sage as well?\u2019\u2018What the h*ll is going on?\u2019\u2018What in the world happened?\u2019Due to the quick turn of events, they were all confused and puzzled.\u201cCan anyone tell me what in the world is happening? How did that Chu Kuangren become a White Lotus Bachelor Sage as well?\u201d\u201cAmong the eight great sage orthodoxies within the Azure Dragon Domain, almost half of them are now giving him protection. By the gods, this is unprecedented indeed.\u201d\u201cWhat has been happening these few days?\u201d\u201cD*mn it, what kind of charm does this Chu Kuangren have on him? Why are all of these sage orthodoxies getting involved with him one by one?\u201d\u201cHaving three great sage orthodoxies to assure the safety of a young junior on his path to cultivation is just too much. Hey hey hey, he doesn\u2019t need to show off with such extravagance!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m impressed. This guy truly is a peerless sky-pride!\u201dWhether it be the average cultivators, sky-prides, or even the other great sage orthodoxies within the Azure Dragon Domain, all were shocked by the news.Besides that, some of the orthodoxies had suddenly come to realize as well, that seeing as three great sage orthodoxies were now protecting Chu Kuangren, they had basically formed an alliance with each other!\u2018He is so young yet he has such great influence on the forces in the Azure Dragon Domain; imagine how powerful Chu Kuangren will be when he matures.\u2019Many orthodoxies were in a dazzled state for a while.\u2026Within the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom.When the current Sect Master of the Serene Wisdom Sect, Master Daoist Ling Hai heard the news, a hint of anxiety flashed across his eyes.\u201cThat kid\u2019s talent is incredibly astonishing. Now he even has the protection of three great sage orthodoxies, there truly is no stopping his eventual rise to power. If this person is not kept in check, the cultivators of my Serene Wisdom Sect will not have any fate to attain Emperor Realm then!\u201dThinking about this, Master Daoist Ling Hai felt a sense of unwillingness and reluctance to accept that fact.He then glanced toward a mountain range that was deep within the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s time to awake that person. The sky-pride from tens of thousands of years before!\u201dAn Emperor Realm cultivator had not appeared for the past hundred and fifty thousand years. Yet during these hundred and fifty thousand years, there was no lack of Supreme Daoist Physique wielders among the scores of sky-prides as well.This was due to how inaccessible the path to Dharma was back then, many sky-prides were reluctant to accept that they were not fated to reach the Emperor Realm and hence they sealed themselves off. While in a state of hibernation, they patiently waited for the opportunity to become an Emperor during the Era of great battles!That was how one of these slumbering sky-prides came to be within the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom.However, this sky-pride had not been woken up all this while. So now that a peerless talent like Chu Kuangren existed, there was a need for someone who would be able to compete toe to toe with him.The slumbering sky-pride would be the best choice for that!\u2026Within the Zhiyang Valley.The Zhiyang Valley\u2019s Lord stared at Lin Batian and sighed deeply. \u201cBatian, are you sure you want to do this?\u201dA determined look could be seen in Lin Batian\u2019s eyes. \u201cChu Kuangren is horrifyingly strong. There won\u2019t be any hope for me to compete with him if I don\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cVery well then. I wish you the very best!\u201dThe Zhiyang Valley\u2019s Lord sighed softly before he waved his arm, opening a portal into the void, where surges of flames with the color of the rainbows were burning within.A terrifying wave of heat filled the realm between the sky and the earth.Lin Batian glanced at that portal and walked into it with determination.\u2026When all the great orthodoxies heard the news that three sage orthodoxies were now protecting Chu Kuangren, they more or less had the same sort of reaction.However, Chu Kuangren was not a bit informed regarding all that was happening behind the scenes.As of that time, he was on the journey towards the Taixu Temple.Something worth noting was that the protectors behind his back had now increased from two to three.Needless to say, the additional protector was provided by the School of White Lotus.He could not help but lament that if he were to give the word, the three of them could even fight against the guardian deity of the land.Atop the Fairy boat.With his eyes closed, Chu Kuangren was deep in his thoughts as great amounts of cultivation techniques emerged within his mind. Most of them were sword techniques, while a small part of them was the School of White Lotus\u2019s techniques.One by one, he integrated all those methods with the Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique. It was clear that he had chosen the path to develop the Single Strike Technique.Moreover, that choice he made was starting to take shape.Now, all he needed was to further refine his understanding of the cultivation techniques and continue to incorporate those techniques into his Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique.Perhaps one day in the future, that single technique of his could ascend into an Emperor Technique.\u201cHuh?\u201d Chu Kuangren suddenly let out a reaction. He signaled Lan Yu to put the Fairy boat to a stop as he tried to sense a certain feeling within him.The peculiar feeling he had during that time came from his Treasure Locating Skill, and because of this, he had a keen sense for valuable items and treasures around him.Activating his Treasure Locating Skill, Chu Kuangren scanned through the area around him.\u201cFound it.\u201dChu Kuangren pointed in a certain direction and steered the Fairy boat towards it.Within some mountain range.Two horrifying surges of energy were clashing against each other, in which every single swirl had enough energy to tear apart mountains and rivers.All of these came from two experienced cultivators who had extremely powerful Daoist Rhymes and spiritual power flowing through their bodies. Yet because of those two men, the surrounding area was sent into a massive shockwave.While at the center of their fight stood a mountain that had a very extraordinary light swirling atop of it. It was a very rare treasure, a type of Supreme Elixir.Although their battle was intense, they were deliberately avoiding spreading any shockwaves from their fight towards the Supreme Elixir.\u201cListen here old man, this piece of Sage Grade Supreme Elixir is mine,\u201d said one of the cultivators who had jolts lightning surging around him.It may not be as potent as a True Sage Grade, but the Sage Grade Supreme Elixir was truly better than most of the Honorable Grade Supreme Elixirs.With a Supreme Elixir like that, he could then break through to the later stage of his Honorable Realm cultivation!\u201cHmph, you think I\u2019m just going to let you have this? In your dreams! Although the others fear your Thunder Falcon Tribe, me and my fellow Taixu Temple cultivators aren\u2019t!\u201d The one facing the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator was an old man in Daoist robes who had a whisk in his hands.\u201cNo point saying anything more, so let\u2019s fight!\u201dThe two of them collided again. Both of them were in the middle stage of Honorable Realm cultivation and were quite evenly matched in skills as the fight went on for quite some time.\u201cBlood Lightning!\u201d The Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable roared as the jolts of lightning around his body turned bloody red, sending violent streams of Daoist Rhymes everywhere.That was one of the strongest secret techniques from the Thunder Falcon Tribe, and although it was powerful enough to kill enemies in the thousands, it would also affect its allies due to its range. Yet despite this, that technique could also increase the user\u2019s power tremendously.The Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator was able to quickly dominate the whisk-holding old man with that Blood Lightning Technique. Just a single blow was enough to push his opponent back hundreds of feet away, and since the old man was struck by that attack, the menacing blood lightning started to corrode the old man\u2019s body.However, the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator knew that the technique was not enough to finish off his opponent, but he could not use the Blood Lightning Technique for long as well as the side effects would be too great for him to handle then.In the end, taking advantage while the whisk-holding old man was injured, he dispersed the Blood Lightning and rushed towards the top of that mountain to grab the Sage Grade Supreme Elixir. His eyes were filled with delight.\u201cThis Supreme Elixir is mine!\u201dAt that moment, a purple sword ray suddenly struck from the skies and the expression of the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator changed as he quickly dodged that attack.The sword ray then landed on the ground with a boom. Immediately, a hundred yard long crack on the ground and the remaining sword Qi in the crack spread everywhere.That level of attack was no less powerful than that of an Honorable Realm cultivator.\u201cWho is it!\u201d The Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator\u2019s expression was extremely grim. \u2018Just when I have the chance to grab it, another guy appears! Where did this disruptor come from?\u2019A white-robed figure could be seen descending from the skies with a silver-haired lady. Paired together, both of them had exceedingly remarkable looks.The one who came was none other than Chu Kuangren, who came with the help of his Treasure Locating Skill, and Lan Yu.\u201cGreetings fellow Daoist, sorry to interrupt. I notice that this Supreme Elixir is very extraordinary and rare. Seeing that I\u2019m fated to get this item, I ask that you please kindly allow me to have it.\u201dChu Kuangren smiled casually.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

I don\u2019t care where you come from, but those who dare get in my way shall die!\u201d Jolts of lightning began to spark around the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator\u2019s body before he let out an attack within a blink of an eye.Chu Kuangren\u2019s gaze narrowed as his Eye of Revelation activated, enabling him to instantly see through his opponent\u2019s skill, cultivation, techniques, and more. \u201cI see you\u2019re from the Thunder Falcon Tribe.\u201dAs the Descendant Self Sword appeared in his grasp, Chu Kuangren did not evade or dodge that attack but instead, he let out a strike with that blade. Immediately after, a horrifying sword ray pushed forth.The sword ray and lightning then collided with each other, spreading terrifying waves of energies everywhere and as the surrounding void rumbled, the mountains around them were ruptured.Chu Kuangren was pushed back several feet due to that impact.\u201cThe battle strength of an Honorable Realm cultivator truly is extraordinary.\u201d Chu Kuangren massaged his numb arm as he let out a determined gaze.Based on his current strength, an average Battle Monarch cultivator was no match for him; only the Honorable Realm cultivators were a challenge to him.\u201cThis b*st*rd\u2019s cultivation\u2026\u201d The expression on the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator\u2019s face suddenly changed, but it was not because Chu Kuangren\u2019s cultivation level was too high.On the contrary, it was because he was a mere Paradise Realm cultivator, which was leagues below the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator.He was an Honorable Realm cultivator, which was a whole two realms beyond Chu Kuangren. However, the battle strength of that Paradise Realm cultivator before him seemed a little too terrifying!\u2018Facing an Honorable head-on unscathed?\u2019\u2018Where did this monster of a sky-pride come from?\u2019\u201cWait a minute.\u201d As if he had recalled something, the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator glared at Chu Kuangren and a glint of horror appeared in his eyes soon after.\u201cAn incredibly remarkable appearance and temperament, coupled with that level of cultivation, you\u2019re the Elder Senior Brother of the Black Heaven Sect, Chu Kuangren!\u201d the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable said in astonishment.Holding his blade, Chu Kuangren replied, \u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201dHis characteristics were too obvious, so he was not surprised to be easily recognized.\u201cI shall retreat for now!\u201dAfter finding out Chu Kuangren\u2019s identity, the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator had no more intentions to continue battling him as his only thought was to leave the area quickly.He was not afraid of Chu Kuangren because after all, he was just a mere Paradise Realm cultivator.However, he was just too afraid of the terrifying protector who stood guard behind him!\u2018That\u2019s an Honorable Supreme we\u2019re talking about here!\u2019Although a mere single-word difference in the words \u2018Honorable\u2019 and \u2018Supreme\u2019, their power levels was a world apart!Not to mention an Honorable Supreme!\u201cHold up, I didn\u2019t say you can leave.\u201d Daoist Rhymes circled around Chu Kuangren as vast amounts of sword Qi emerged from the void and materialized into multiple great pillars before him.Daoist Physique Transformation, Nine Heaven Sword Prison, activate!Once Chu Kuangren had merged with the spatial force, the sealing capabilities of the Sword Prison increased so much that even an Honorable Realm cultivator would not be able to escape so easily.\u201cChu Kuangren, I have already given up on the Supreme Elixir, what else do you want?\u201d the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable asked in an angry and frustrated tone.Chu Kuangren shrugged. \u201cNothing much, I only want to either be the one who kills you or be one killed by you.\u201dAt that, the Daoist Rhyme on his body circulated more aggressively before both the Sword of The Heavens and Green Lotus Sword Song materialized and deployed.Like crashing water, immense amounts of Sword-based Daoist Rhyme surged forth!He had improved at too fast a pace in this period of time that even a Young Emperor would not be able to withstand a few attacks by him. Among his younger peers, Chu Kuangren was seemingly undefeatable.Due to that, he needed an opponent to gauge the limits of his true strength, and the Honorable Realm cultivator before him proved to be an obvious and suitable choice.\u201cYou think I\u2019m just going to let you do what you want?\u201d Upon seeing that Chu Kuangren had no intention of backing down, the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator became so enraged that he let out another attack again.Overbearing surges of Lightning-based Daoist Rhyme circulated his body as jolts of white lightning reverberated in the void. Then one by one, every jolt of white lightning was launched towards Chu Kuangren.Every jolt contained an incomparable force of destruction. It was sad to say that the Young Emperor Lei Ao, who was recently killed by Chu Kuangren, would not be able to compare with that too.That was the power of an Honorable!\u201cVery well, come.\u201d Chu Kuangren did not retreat but charged forth instead. With his three great Transformations activated, the four supreme foundations within his body shone brightly.One strike and the terrifying sword ray engorged the surrounding area. It was the most basic and pure offensive technique \u2014 the absolute Daoist Rhyme of his Single Strike Technique!Wherever the sword ray went, it instantly shattered the jolts of lightning without fail.Not far away, the old man in Daoist robes had just come back to his senses and when he witnessed the battle before him, his face revealed an expression of shock and fear. \u201cWhat a horrifyingly strong young man.\u201d\u2018A mere Paradise Realm cultivator is going toe to toe with an Honorable?\u2019He had never come across such a thing before.Boom, crackle, boom\u2026One after another, the purple sword rays collided with the silver-white jolts of lightning, creating dazzling and beautiful sparks as the extremely powerful surges of Daoist Rhymes clashed in the void.The power behind the Daoist Rhymes was so immense that the surrounding mountain and river terrains were exploded to bits.As the three protectors looked on at Chu Kuangren who was going all out for the very first time, even they could not help but feel shocked.\u201cIt\u2019s too powerful. The Bachelor Sage is too strong, considering that he\u2019s only a Paradise Realm now. If he were to reach the level of a Battle Monarch or even an Honorable, who knows how strong his battle strength will be even then?\u201dWithin the dark void, the white-robed middle-aged lady from the School of White Lotus exclaimed with shock.\u201cI agree, the battle strength of the Royal Princess\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is truly remarkable. I believe that in this era, he will end up on top for the fight of the Emperor Realm!\u201dThe old lady from the Royal Azure Dynasty said.The Seventh Forefather looked very proud. \u201cThat\u2019s indeed true. Well don\u2019t you forget, the young lad is still the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother. \u201d\u201cHe\u2019s now the Fianc\u00e9 of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Eldest Princess too.\u201d\u201cAnd also a Bachelor Sage from my School of White Lotus.\u201dBoth the old lady and the middle-aged lady replied with dissatisfaction.Outside the void.The battle between Chu Kuangren and the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator was now coming to an end. Knowing well that he could not break through his opponent\u2019s defense, the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable gritted his teeth and once again launched that Blood Lightning Technique that was equally harmful to his enemies and himself.All of a sudden, a surge of terrifyingly violent blood-colored lightning exploded!\u201cDie! Chu Kuangren!\u201d the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator roared. Then, the jolts of lightning began to intertwine and form into a horrifying blood-colored killing web.As the terrifying Lightning-based Daoist Rhyme locked onto Chu Kuangren, making it hard for him to escape, the three protectors of his were prepared to step in at any time.However, Chu Kuangren\u2019s blade could be seen levitating in the air while he made a series of hand signs that activated a mysterious technique, and a vast amount of Daoist Rhymes surged forth.1A white light then gushed forth from Chu Kuangren\u2019s body and pieces of white lotus appeared in the void. That was the White Lotus\u2019s Light of Purification!As jolts of blood-colored lighting landed on the white lotus that had now surrounded the void, the lightning immediately disintegrated and converted into spiritual Qi before it dispersed into the surroundings.\u201cThat\u2019s impossible! What kind of technique is this!\u201d The Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator squinted, his face shocked.Meanwhile, in the void, the middle-aged lady\u2019s eyes were filled with delight. \u201cThis is the White Lotus\u2019s Light of Purification Technique used by the White Lotus Sage Ruler. Legends say that this technique can disintegrate spiritual powers and decompose Daoist Rhymes, purifying everything that touches it. It\u2019s an incomparable defense technique!\u201d\u201cI cannot believe that in only a few days after gaining insights on this technique, he\u2019s able to use it so masterfully. It\u2019s truly remarkable, truly remarkable indeed! \u201dThe old lady and the Seventh Forefather were astonished. The power of the White Lotus\u2019s Light of Purification Technique was amazing.It was no wonder no one had been able to gain insights on it all these years; that technique was just too marvelous.\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique\u201d Taking advantage as the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable was still in shock, Chu Kuangren immediately attacked with a single strike, and suddenly, a terrifyingly violent sword ray instantly surged forth.Wherever the sword ray brushed past, the surrounding void rumbled. At that, the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator hurriedly sent out a jolt of blood lightning to block the attack but he was still heavily hit by that attack.\u201cD*mn it!\u201d The Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator panicked.However, Chu Kuangren\u2019s attack did not cease. With the White Lotus\u2019s Light of Purification as his defense and the Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique as his offense, his battle strength was powerful like none other.So the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator had no choice but to steadily retreat after having suffered one injury after another.Seeing that it was almost time, Chu Kuangren suddenly opened his palm and a dark black whirlpool appeared at the center of it like the mouth of a huge terrifying beast.\u201cGluttonous Devouring Technique!\u201dWith a soft roar, a huge suction immediately erupted from Chu Kuangren\u2019s palm. Once he had locked onto the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator, he was sucked in.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83: Refining an Honorable With the Gluttonous Devouring Technique, Taixu Temple\u2019s Wuchen ZiGluttonous Devouring Technique!That technique was a Sage Ruler Technique in which Chu Kuangren had obtained from the Black Light Sage. It was an incredibly strong technique that enabled the user to establish a refining dimension within their bodies. Cultivators who were sucked into that dimension would have their blood and flesh essence subsequently processed.If the target were ordinary cultivators, Chu Kuangren could use the Gluttonous Devouring Technique on them without fail. However, facing an Honorable, Chu Kuangren would need to first weaken his opponent till the brink of death before using that technique. Otherwise, based on his current level of cultivation, Chu Kuangren would not succeed in using that technique.The dimension that was created by the Gluttonous Devouring Technique was one of pitch-black darkness. After the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator was sucked into it, an immense fear started to well up deep inside him.Following that, powerful refining energies erupted around the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator before his blood and flesh gradually eroded and broke down.\u201cWhat kind of weird technique is this!\u201d\u201cNo, please\u2026 No!\u201dIf the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable was his peak state, he might have stood a chance in holding back the refining energy. However, because he was heavily injured and hence terribly weakened, he was like a sitting duck in the face of the refining energy.Multiple bursts of blood and flesh essences were circulated throughout Chu Kuangren\u2019s body via the refining dimension from the Gluttonous Devouring Technique. In the end, these essences headed towards his internal spiritual mound and gathered there.His Four Great Supreme Daoist Foundations, namely the Foundation Establishment, Golden Jade, Nascent Soul, and Purple Palace let out a dazzling divine ray that felt seemingly joyful.The blood and flesh essences were absorbed by the Four Great Supreme Daoist Foundations and converted into pure spiritual power that expanded Chu Kuangren\u2019s spiritual mound while improving his cultivation.The essence of an Honorable had much effect on Chu Kuangren, allowing him to raise his cultivation to the peak late stages of Paradise Realm.However, it might also be due to how strong Chu Kuangren\u2019s Daoist Foundation was too. If an ordinary cultivator were to absorb the same amount of essences as he did, he would have experienced much more significant growth.Then again, the important fact was there was an increase in one\u2019s combat power.Chu Kuangren licked his lips. \u201cWhat a splendid technique this is. With the Gluttonous Devouring Technique, all the world\u2019s cultivators are basically essence pills waiting to be eaten indeed.\u201dThinking of this, Chu Kuangren suddenly shuddered. He then quickly tossed that dangerous thought away and restabilized his Daoist heart.Although the technique was strong, the user would end up reaping the bad fruit of their own karmic actions if it was not controlled properly. Not only would their reputation and luck be ruined, but they might even fall into the process of becoming a demon.The user should be the one in control of the techniques they used and not the other way around!After killing the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator, Chu Kuangren went to the mountain top, grabbed that Sage Grade Supreme Elixir, and kept it within his Yin and Yang ring.Although the old Daoist man not far away was very unsatisfied, he still had to accept the facts. Not to mention how powerful that young man\u2019s strength was to even defeat the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator, the mere mention of his name \u2018Chu Kuangren\u2019 was already frightening enough.\u2018Because there are three f*cking sage orthodoxies looking over that young man\u2019s back!\u2019The old Daoist walked towards Chu Kuangren and greeted, \u201cGreetings Brother Chu, my name is Ling Zheng, First Vein of the Purple Void from the Taixu Temple.\u201dAfter witnessing that Chu Kuangren was able to kill the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator, Ling Zheng had chosen to address him as a fellow Daoist brother. That meant that Chu Kuangren was held on the same level of existence as him.At that point, Ling Zheng could not help but lament at Chu Kuangren\u2019s greatness. \u2018Having the protection of three sage orthodoxies, and even possessing such impressive talents, that person\u2019s future is truly going to be a bright and limitless one. Not to say he\u2019ll become an Emperor, but this man is certainly going to become a sage when the time comes.\u2019\u201cGreetings Brother Ling.\u201d Chu Kuangren gently nodded.Since that person had greeted him as a fellow Daoist, he might as well not refuse and go along with it. At the same time, Chu Kuangren was also surprised to find that Ling Zheng came from Taixu Temple.\u2018Well isn\u2019t this a coincidence?\u2019He was just going to visit the Taixu Temple as well.Chu Kuangren then told Ling Zheng his intentions.\u201cWe, the Taixu Temple will definitely welcome Brother Chu if he wishes to pay us a visit.\u201d With a smile, Ling Zheng then led Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu towards the Taixu Temple.\u2026The Taoxu Temple was located somewhere off the beaten path within the mountains.That day, the sound of bells ringing echoed and spread throughout the Taixu Temple. It was a sign that an esteemed guest was coming to visit the place.A few of the disciples were impatiently looking out for their guests in front of the mountain gate.Not long after, an old man leading a man and woman arrived. Seeing that, a few of the disciples hurriedly went to welcome them.\u201cGreetings Elder Ling, Brother Chu, and Sister Lan.\u201d Those disciples had received the message earlier so they knew that Ling Zheng was bringing Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu for a visit.\u201cGreetings. Where are the Temple Lord and the others?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re already waiting at the grand pagoda.\u201dThe disciples then led the three of them further up the mountain.Along the way, a few of the disciples were secretly checking out Chu Kuangren, since there were just too many rumors and news surrounding that person.The key point was that each of them was similarly shocking and astounding.They were just too curious about that person.\u2018Everyone here is around the same age, so why is Chu Kuangren so amazing?\u2019In the grand pagoda of the Taixu Temple, the current Taixu Temple\u2019s Lord and a few other elders were already gathered there, waiting for Chu Kuangren\u2019s arrival.One thing to keep note of was that those people were Honorables themselves, with the Taixu Temple\u2019s Lord being an Honorable Supreme as well, but all of them had been waiting for a young junior to arrive. If word about this were to spread, the cultivators around the world would be dumbfounded.However, they had no choice but to take Chu Kuangren, as he was now, seriously.Seeing that a white-robed figure was walking into the grand pagoda, the Taixu Temple\u2019s Lord smiled. \u201cWord says that the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother is a remarkable person, and today it seems that the rumors are not false. The appearance of a dark fairy descending upon the world truly is a fitting description for you.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re too kind, Temple Lord.\u201d Chu Kuangren greeted and bowed.\u201cLing Zheng has already informed me of Brother Chu\u2019s intention to visit. I shall arrange someone tomorrow to spar with you, Brother Chu.\u201d\u201cMany thanks, Temple Lord.\u201d\u201cElder Wang, Brother Chu has traveled a long way to get here. Please bring him to our guest quarters to rest.\u201d The Taixu Temple\u2019s Lord said towards an elder beside him.\u201cYes, of course.\u201dAfter Chu Kuangren and the others were gone, the Taixu Temple\u2019s Lord\u2019s suddenly had a stern look on his face. \u201cOne Honorable Supreme and the other two are at least in the same existence as Honorables. The rumors are true, the three great sage orthodoxies are protecting this man on his path of cultivation. This is really shocking indeed.\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren is just too talented and skilled.\u201d\u201cThat person has enough strength to kill an Honorable.\u201d After that, Ling Zheng told the others in detail about how Chu Kuangren killed the Thunder Falcon Tribe\u2019s Honorable cultivator.Everyone in the grand pagoda gasped in shock at what they heard.\u201cBeing able to fight a Battle Monarch while still in the Paradise Realm already qualifies as a Young Emperor, but what about killing an Honorable then? What kind of beast is this sky-pride? Isn\u2019t this just too terrifying?\u201d\u201cThis person\u2019s strength cannot be measured by ordinary common sense.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid that even Wuchen will find it hard to fight against him then.\u201dThe crowd discussed in the grand pagoda, lamenting about what they had learned.\u2026Under Elder Wang\u2019s guidance, Chu Kuangren was brought to a guest room.\u201cBrother Chu, there\u2019s a small bell inside this room. If you require something, just ring the bell and someone will attend to you soon after,\u201d Elder Wand politely said.\u201cThank you for your trouble.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome. We\u2019re glad to have you as a guest here as well.\u201dElder Wang left after that.When Chu Kuangren entered the guest room, he noticed that there were a few rooms within it and there was also a bell hung on the main door. Curious, he went to shake it.Then, a soothing ringing sound rang out. Not long after, a young Daoist with short hair came to him and asked Chu Kuangren what was the matter.\u201cSince this is my first time here, little Daoist, I don\u2019t really know much about the fun places to visit around here. Mind if you tell me about them? \u201d\u201cSure, of course.\u201dThe little Daoist then started to tell Chu Kuangren about the places to visit.Halfway through, the little Daoist noticed Chu Kuangren\u2019s gaze was outside so he looked out curiously as well.A young man wearing a green Daoist robe with a delicate face was slowly walking towards them. He had a calm temperament about him.Upon seeing that person, the little Daoist was very shocked and he immediately went to greet him. \u201cGreetings, Brother Wuchen!\u201dThe name \u2018Wuchen Zi\u2019 was a legendary one within Taixu Temple. He was the most remarkable sky-pride among the younger generation of cultivators. Besides that, he was the only cultivator who was acknowledged with a Taixu Seal for the past thousands of years.\u201cMhm.\u201d Wuchen Zi gently nodded. After that, he folded his hands and bowed at Chu Kuangren. \u201cGreetings, Brother Chu, my name is Wuchen Zi.\u201d\u201cGreetings, Brother Wuchen.\u201dChu Kuangren smiled gently as a few runes flashed across his eyes. He was already using the Eye of Revelation to observe and gather information about his opponent.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

However, rumor said that the person had been in closed-door meditation all this time, so no matter be it the marriage by combat or the Secret Realm excursion, no one had seen this person.Today was Chu Kuangren\u2019s first time meeting him.Some said that if not for Wuchen Zi\u2019s closed-door meditation, Gu Changge\u2019s Path of Invincibility would not have hit the Black Heaven Sect. He would have failed when he reached the Taixu Temple, seeing as it was obvious that Wuchen Zi was no small fry.However, under the analysis provided by the Eye of Revelation, it seemed like Wuchen Zi\u2019s overall prowess and strength did, in fact, exceed Gu Changge\u2019s by a large percentage.\u201cAlthough I\u2019ve been in Taixu Temple for quite a long while, I have also heard about Brother Chu\u2019s fame. So I specially came to pay you a visit today.\u201d Wuchen Zi smiled.\u201cI hope you\u2019re pleased with what you see.\u201d\u201cThe aura of a Banished Immortal, it\u2019s truly remarkable.\u201d\u201cYeah, I get that a lot.\u201dChu Kuangren nodded in agreement without any hint of shame.\u201cI have heard about Brother Chu\u2019s purpose for visiting Taixu Temple. Does Brother Chu intend to follow what Gu Changge did previously?\u201dAt that time, to cultivate his Heart of Invincibility, Gu Changge single-handedly challenged the disciples of a few sage orthodoxies to battle. From his perspective, Wuchen Zi felt that Chu Kuangren\u2019s purpose of visiting each of the great sage orthodoxies was similar to Gu Changge\u2019s.\u201cSheesh, Brother Wuchen. You really are harsh on words, aren\u2019t you? That Gu Changge made such a big fuss last time, it\u2019s like he\u2019s afraid the world would never know what he did. On the other hand, I have been keeping a much lower profile unlike him. Besides, I\u2019m merely seeking someone to mentally spar with. I won\u2019t lay a single finger on anyone.\u201dChu Kuangren chuckled.Those words of his made Wuchen Zi look at him weirdly. \u201cDidn\u2019t Brother Chu visit the White Lotus School previously? Not long after, word started to spread about Brother Chu becoming a White Lotus Bachelor Sage. Isn\u2019t that a world sensation as well?\u201d\u201cSo all of this is what Brother Chu means by\u2026 Keeping a low profile?\u201dUpon hearing that, Chu Kuangren helplessly shrugged and replied, \u201cThat was something that happened out of the blue. Will you believe me, Brother Wuchen?\u201dWho knew that the White Lotus Light of Purification Technique held such significance to the School of the White Lotus, that it was directly related to the whole cultivation foundation of the orthodoxy as well.\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter whether I believe it or not. What\u2019s important is the reason that I\u2019ve come to visit Brother Chu, as I intend to\u2026 mentally spar with you.\u201dAs Wuchen Zi said those words, the little Daoist attendant beside him jumped in shock.\u2018Senior Brother Wuchen wants to mentally spar with Chu Kuangren?\u2019\u201cSure, of course.\u201dChu Kuangren had no reason to object because after all, that was his purpose of visit.\u201cAfter you.\u201d Wuchen Zi waved his sleeves and two cushion pads appeared before them. He then went and sat on one of them while Daoist Rhymes began to emanate around his body.Chu Kuangren took a seat directly opposite him.As the sky-prides of the current generation mentally sparred before him, the little Daoist at the side was extremely excited but dared not make any noise for fear of disturbing both of them.Within the room, two surges of Daoist Rhymes started to clash against each other within the room.The Sword of The Heavens looked ever so sharp above Chu Kuangren\u2019s head, while Wuchen Zi was surrounded by a rolling sea of clouds that seemed unpredictable and ethereal.As the Daoist Rhymes spread out of the room, it was picked up by some of the experienced cultivators nearby.\u201cSomeone\u2019s mentally sparring now.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s coming from the direction of the guest room. It must be Chu Kuangren.\u201d\u201cWhat an immeasurably sharp Sword-based Daoist Rhyme. On the other hand, there\u2019s a surge of ethereal fluctuation, so that must be our Taixu Sect\u2019s Dao. That\u2019s Wuchen Zi! \u201d\u201cThese two were mentally sparring so soon?\u201dCurious, some of the Taixu Temple elders headed towards the mental sparring location of those two.\u201cBesides the Ethereal Taixu Technique, which is one of the most well-known cultivation techniques within my Taixu Sect, other famous ones are namely the thirty-two sets of Supreme Techniques and two sets of Sage Techniques. Among these techniques, I have only learned twelve of them, so please allow me to learn more from you, Brother Chu.\u201dBy the time the crowd of elders rushed to the location, they only heard Wuchen Zi\u2019s explanation of the Dao. After that, his Daoist Rhyme started to change its form and materialize into a type of technique.The sea of clouds rolled, forming into clusters of clouds which surged forth towards Chu Kuangren from all directions.\u201cThis is the Cloud Flipping Technique!\u201d One of the elders recognized it.Just when the cluster of clouds had managed to get near Chu Kuangren, a ray of light flashed across the room from the Sword of the Heavens above his head and the cloud clusters were instantly shattered.Not surprised, Wuchen Zi continued to manipulate his Daoist Rhyme, forming them into multiple mysterious and interesting techniques.\u201cThat\u2019s the Supreme Technique, Willow Whisking Technique!\u201d\u201cAnd also the Chilling Spring Technique.\u201d\u201cTsk, it\u2019s so rare to see someone who has mastered so many types of Supreme Techniques to such a level.\u201d\u201cNo doubt about it. He truly is the only sky-pride who is acknowledged by the Taixu Seal, and that\u2019s truly remarkable. \u201d\u201cHey, take a look at Chu Kuangren.\u201dWuchen Zi did possess a marvelous assortment of techniques, but no matter how violent a storm he cooked up, Chu Kuangren remained unmoved.The Sword of the Heavens levitated above his head, with sword rays flashing from time to time. None of the techniques were able to land onto his body.The Single Strike Technique was demonstrated vividly in perfection.At this time.The sea of clouds surrounding Wuchen Zi transformed into an artificial sun and as the sun rose, its light covered tens of thousands of feet. It was an extremely dazzling sight.Then, the great golden ray of light shot out from the artificial sun, passed through the sea of clouds and headed towards Chu Kuangren like an arrow.\u201cThat\u2019s the Sage Technique, Sunlight Overdrive Destruction!\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe Wuchen Zi resorted to using such a technique that quickly as it\u2019s meant to be a last resort move. It seems like Chu Kuangren is pushing him to the limit and giving him tremendous amounts of pressure.\u201dThe crowd of elders each exclaimed in marvel.Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren was still ever so calm despite facing the Sage Technique. Above his head, the Sword of the Heavens shot out a purple sword ray.When the purple sword ray clashed together with the great golden sun ray, the golden sun rays were instantly torn apart like it was a piece of thin paper!The sword ray was such an overwhelming force that as soon as it landed on Wuchen Zi\u2019s body, he was seen trembling slightly as the Daoist Rhyme surrounding him dispersed.With that, the mental sparring bout reached its end with a clear outcome.\u201cYour Dao is still lacking and your techniques are still not strong enough,\u201d Chu Kuangren said casually. There was no aggression, no arrogance, nor contempt in the tone of his voice. It was as if he was merely explaining a fact.However, that was indeed the most shocking part of the sentence. This meant that Chu Kuangren was already on a whole new level of existence compared to Wuchen Zi.It was like comparing humans to ants.Would a person be glad of being stronger than an ant? Would they despise the ants because of that fact?Of course not, merely because they were on a different level.Wuchen Zi truly understood what that meant and he could not help but let out a bitter smile. The difference was just too great.He was the most outstanding sky-pride in Taixu Temple. However, when compared to Chu Kuangren, he felt that he was too insignificant, too weak.\u201cIt\u2019s an honor to have the opportunity to mentally spar with you, Brother Chu. I have gained a lot of lessons and experience from this session.\u201d Wuchen Zi stood up and bowed.He did indeed gain something, but most of it was feelings of despair and sorrow.Chu Kuangren nodded slightly. \u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201dHe did not intend to console Wuchen Zi because it was pointless to do so. The fact that he still was stronger than Wuchen Zi still stood as established.Wuchen Zi would have to overcome this by himself.\u201cSigh, the difference is just too great.\u201d\u201cI agree.\u201dA few\u00a0Taixu Temple\u2019s elders could not help but sigh.At that time, the Taixu Temple\u2019s Lord was walking towards them slowly. Upon seeing him, Wuchen Zi immediately bowed and greeted him, \u201cGreeting, teacher.\u201dWuchen Zi was the personal disciple of the current Taixu Temple\u2019s Lord.\u201cA moment of victory or defeat does not mean it\u2019ll stay that way forever. Wuchen, this is just a lesson for you. Do not get too saddened over it.\u201d Upon seeing the sorrow in Wuchen Zi\u2019s eyes, the Taixu Temple\u2019s Lord could not help but feel distressed at his disciple\u2019s defeat.\u201cI understand, teacher.\u201d Wuchen Zi nodded.After that, the Taixu Temple\u2019s Lord looked at Chu Kuangren and said, \u201cJunior Daoist Chu, I see that your understanding of the Dao is quite refined and profound. I\u2019m afraid that there\u2019s no one among your peers that can compare with you, which is why I wonder, would an old man like me have the honor to mentally spar with you?\u201dThose words immediately caused an uproar.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 85": "\ud83d\udcd5WuxiaClick\ud83c\udf19Home/Unparalleled After Ten Consecutive DrawsCH 85Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlay\u2018The Taixu Temple Lord wants to mentally spar with Chu Kuangren?\u2019The moment those words came out, it immediately caused an uproar among everyone present.What was the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s full identity?Being the leader of the sage orthodoxy and an Honorable Supreme, the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s fame was known throughout the Azure Dragon Domain. Everywhere he went, he was revered.Yet such a well-distinguished person wanted to mentally spar with a young junior?\u2018When word spreads about this, it will shock everyone to death.\u2019Even Chu Kuangren froze for a while when he heard the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s words. No matter how he thought about it, Chu Kuangren still felt that the Taixu Temple Lord wanted to vent his anger on him.\u2018Not bad, he knows how to fight back for the weak.\u2019Chu Kuangren chuckled and a glimmer of light flashed across his eyes.The Taixu Temple Lord was not mistaken. Chu Kuangren had gone through multiple sessions of Daoist enlightenment, and on top of the Meditational Clarity Trait that he had gained, he had become ever more deeply in tune with his understanding of Daoism. Compared to his peers, Chu Kuangren had long surpassed all of them in leagues.No, even the experienced senior cultivators could not hope to compete with him too.Chu Kuangren knew that he would not be able to gain much understanding and insight into Daoism if he continued to mentally spar with the cultivators of his generation. So only by mentally sparring with top-notched cultivators would he be able to gain tremendous insights.The Taixu Temple Lord was undoubtedly someone like that.\u201cA junior like me will not dare to refuse the Temple Lord\u2019s invite.\u201dChu Kuangren smiled gently.\u201cVery well. Then I shall wait for you in the Distant Day Palace Hall tomorrow.\u201d With a simple smile, the Taixu Temple Lord bowed and left.As he turned around to leave, a hint of regret flashed past the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s eyes.\u2018Sigh, I was too impulsive, just too impulsive.\u2019A high and mighty Honorable Supreme like him actually proposed a mental sparring match with a young junior cultivator. If word were to spread about this, he would be embarrassed to death.However, since those words had been spoken, he had no way of turning back.After the Taixu Temple Lord and others left, the Seventh Forefather frowned. \u201cHey kid, do you truly intend to mentally spar with the Taixu Temple Lord?\u201d\u201cNaturally yes, of course. This is a great opportunity for me to properly witness and learn about the Taixu Temple\u2019s Fully Realized Daoist techniques.\u201d\u201cThe Taixu Temple Lord is still an Honorable Supreme, kid. There aren\u2019t many who can match his level of understanding in the Dao. Although your life won\u2019t be in danger during the mental sparring match, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019d cause damage to your Daoist core if the difference is too great.\u201d\u201cMy Daoist core is as solid and unshaken as a rock!\u201dChu Kuangren chuckled with confidence.His level of understanding in the Dao was more or less on par with an Honorable, so even if the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s level of understanding in the Dao was much higher than him, it would not affect his Daoist heart.\u201cVery well.\u201d The Seventh Forefather nodded.\u2026Within half a day, everyone knew of Chu Kuangren\u2019s mental sparring match with the Taixu Temple Lord, and countless people were very shocked upon hearing it.For a moment, everyone in Taixu Temple was talking and discussing it.\u201cAn Honorable Supreme will be mentally sparring with a junior Paradise Realm cultivator? Is the world mad? Or am I mad instead?\u201d\u201cBloody hell! This Chu Kuangren is b*d*ss!\u201d\u201cI heard that Brother Wuchen also went to mentally spar with Chu Kuangren, but he failed miserably in the end. Do you suppose the Temple Lord is venting out his anger for Brother Wuchen?\u201d\u201cIt could be possible, based on the Temple Lord\u2019s character.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right. I heard somewhere that a few decades ago, Brother Wuchen was injured by an Honorable while he was traveling down the mountain to gain experience in cultivation. The Temple Lord was so enraged that he immediately went to that Honorable Orthodoxy and brutally killed him on the spot.\u201d\u201cTsk tsk, no matter what, the fact that Chu Kuangren is going to mentally spar with the Temple Lord is just too shocking. I have to go witness that match tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll be going as well.\u201d\u201cMe too.\u201dIn the grand pagoda.The Taixu Temple Lord and a few elders were gathered there in the discussion.\u201cMy lord, are you insane? Do you remember your identity? How can you seek out a young junior to mentally spar with?\u201d One of the elders bluntly remarked. Since he was the only one who had a good relationship with the Taixu Temple Lord, only he dared to speak in that manner.The other elders did not express their opinions directly like that, but their gazes spoke of dissatisfaction. They all felt that the Taixu Temple Lord had gone a little overboard.The Taixu Temple Lord said calmly, \u201cChu Kuangren is an amazingly talented person. Don\u2019t all of you want to find out where his limit is?\u201d\u201cMy lord, do you mean\u2026 This is just to test him?\u201d\u201cYes. It may only be a mental sparring match unlike actual combat, but if I were the one doing it, I can at least get a proper grasp of that kid\u2019s true strength.\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s not necessary for you to do it yourself though.\u201d\u201cLing Zheng has told us before that this kid is able to kill an Honorable. This means that his understanding of the Dao is comparable to an Honorable. Only I can be assured to complete this task,\u201d the Taixu Temple Lord replied indifferently.\u201cSo that\u2019s how it is.\u201dOnly then did the elders\u2019 dissatisfaction disappear.Upon seeing that, the Taixu Temple Lord was relieved.\u2018I guess I finally explained my way out of that one.\u2019In actuality, he never thought much about it when he proposed the mental sparring match to Chu Kuangren. All he wanted was to vent out his anger for his disciple.However, now that he thought of it, even if Wuchen Zi was not the underlying factor for him to do so, he should still take action himself to test Chu Kuangren\u2019s limits instead.\u201cChu Kuangren\u2026\u201d\u201cI shall look forward to your performance tomorrow.\u201dThe Taixu Temple Lord murmured.\u2026The second day.The Distant Day Palace Hall was filled with cultivators from the Taixu Temple. Everyone was eagerly waiting for the mental sparring match that had the greatest power disparity difference in the world.An Honorable Supreme, and a junior Paradise Realm cultivator.\u201cIt\u2019s about to start. This really is exciting.\u201d\u201cWhere\u2019s Chu Kuangren, has he arrived yet?\u201d\u201cLook, he\u2019s here.\u201dAt that moment, at the end of the crowd, the white-robed, fairy-like Chu Kuangren was slowly walking towards the hall with Lan Yu beside him.The way he walked in slowly had a calmness to it.Behind him, Lan Yu followed suit when she noticed her Master doing that.The man and woman pair instantly attracted the gazes of everyone present in the hall. Even the great cultivators who had thousands of years of cultivation could not help but exclaim with shock at the sight of them.His poised posture dazzled everyone around him.Step by step, Chu Kuangren walked towards the Distant Day Palace Hall and saw that the Taixu Temple Lord was already waiting inside. He was sitting on a futon mattress with his back facing Chu Kuangren.A glint of excitement was revealed in Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes.How much would they differ in their Daoist techniques?At that time, a figure suddenly walked out from the crowd. It was a young cultivator who wore a headband and had an eager look in his eyes.\u201cMy name is Qingyun, a disciple of the Taixu Temple. Pardon me, Brother Chu, but I have a Daoist technique that I would like your guidance!\u201d Following that, Daoist Rhymes appeared around that young cultivator\u2019s body and formed into a sea of clouds. Then, a sun rose and a sudden golden light ray shot out towards Chu Kuangren.That was the Daoist Rhyme from the Sunlight Overdrive Destruction Sage Technique!\u201cI\u2019m Fengxuan of the Taixu Temple. Please allow me to demonstrate my Daoist Technique and learn from you!\u201d\u201cI\u2019m Qingxin from the Taixu Temple, please allow me to learn from you!\u201dFollowing that, multiple young cultivators walked out. Not using their spiritual power but only their Daoist Rhymes, all sorts of mysterious transformations were sent towards Chu Kuangren in one go.Those people were among the younger generation of sky-prides.They all respected Chu Kuangren, but they were also unsatisfied as well. Hence, they could not resist but launch out their attacks simultaneously towards him, with the intention to give him a feeling of defeat.However, it was a shame that Chu Kuangren had no care for them as his gaze was set on the Taixu Temple Lord who was sitting in the center of the Distant Day Palace Hall.As those multiple surges of Daoist Rhymes headed his way, the Sword of the Heavens appeared above Chu Kuangren\u2019s head. The sword ray merely flashed once before the multiple surges of Daoist Rhymes were all blown away and shattered like smoke in a wind.None of those attacks was able to land on Chu Kuangren\u2019s body.That gap in strength made the onlooking sky-prides uncontrollably shocked.Their gap in strength compared to Chu Kuangren was just too great!How could a firefly ever hope to compare with the brightness of a full moon night?Once he had passed by a crowd of sky-prides, Chu Kuangren was at the entrance of the Distant Day Palace Hall. Lan Yu then waited at the entrance while Chu Kuangren walked into the palace hall without hesitation.\u201cI apologize for the behavior of my disciples. I\u2019m truly embarrassed knowing that Junior Chu had seen this.\u201dThe Taixu Temple Lord turned around and let out an apologetic smile.Chu Kuangren was not bothered by it at all. Instead, he immediately sat on the futon mat opposite the Taixu Temple Lord. \u201cIt\u2019s just a small thing, nothing to worry about.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They all felt begrudged and frustrated.\u201cWith Junior Chu around, all of the sky-prides in this world have been reduced to mediocrity.\u201d The Taixu Temple Lord looked at Chu Kuangren and said.\u201cI \u2026 dare not deny the Temple Lord\u2019s words.\u201d1Chu Kuangren did not look humble at all.It was because, from his perspective, that was truly an established fact. Even a Young Emperor would not be able to fight back if they were to face him.If that was already the case with a Young Emperor, then what about the other so-called sky-prides?It seemed as though no one could be qualified as sky-prides before Chu Kuangren.The corners of the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s mouth twitched. This was the first time he came across such an arrogant person, who lacked any sense of humbleness at all.The name \u2018Chu Kuangren\u2019 truly was given correctly.\u201cAfter you, Temple Lord,\u201d Chu Kuangren gently said. He could not wait to mentally spar with the Honorable Supreme who sat before him.\u201cNo. You\u2019re a junior cultivator and also our esteemed guest. After you.\u201d\u201cThen I shall take up your offer then.\u201dDaoist Rhyme surrounded Chu Kuangren as the Sword of the Heavens materialized above his head and then, multiple sword rays shot out towards the Taixu Temple Lord.\u201cWhat a deadly and sharp Sword-based Daoist Rhyme, not bad.\u201d The Taixu Temple Lord chuckled as a gust of ethereal looking Daoist Rhymes gathered around him and turned into a rolling sea of clouds which enveloped around the sword rays.In an instant, the countless sword rays disappeared without a trace.Chu Kuangren was not surprised. It would be surprising if the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s Daoist technique was not strong enough to block a few of his sword rays instead.\u201cHeaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique!\u201dWithout hesitation, Chu Kuangren immediately deployed his Sage Ruler Technique\u2019s Daoist Rhyme.A surge of immeasurably lethal Daoist Rhyme rose up. Following that, the Sword of Heaven shook slightly and a domineering purple sword ray instantly shot out.Although it was not imbued with spiritual power, the mere Daoist Rhyme in that attack alone was sufficient to scare most people to their deaths. Numerous sky-prides outside the Distant Day Palace Hall went pale with fear and their lips turned purple upon seeing that sword ray. They could only feel how insignificant they were.\u201cIf he were to deploy such a Daoist technique against me yesterday during the mental spar, I\u2019m afraid my Daoist core would have been greatly affected,\u201d Wuchen Zi uttered in fright.Not only him, but a few of the Taixu Temple\u2019s elders were also shocked by that display of power. They had realized that even they themselves could not hope to conjure up such a strong technique like that. Chu Kuangren\u2019s understanding of Daoism was already at such a deeply refined level!\u201cHa, what an interesting Sage Ruler Technique. What a splendid Single Strike Technique indeed!\u201d the Taixu Temple Lord exclaimed. Even he had to stay cautious before Chu Kuangren\u2019s Daoist techniques.As Daoist Rhyme started to swirl and the sea of clouds started to roll again, the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s Daoist Rhyme surged forth to shroud the domineering purple sword ray within itself.Purple flashes of light flickered within the layer of clouds before they burst open and as if a strong wind had blown, the two surges of Daoist Rhymes were instantly swept through the Distant Day Palace Hall.The candle lights around the area flickered while the doors and windows creaked\u2026\u201cYoung junior, try this technique of mine.\u201d The Taixu Temple Lord smiled as used his Daoist technique to form a few clusters of clouds which then headed towards Chu Kuangren.How could an Honorable Supreme\u2019s Daoist techniques be that simple?Even if those were Supreme Techniques, Chu Kuangren still gave it his one hundred and twenty percent effort as he continuously deployed his Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique.One after another, the sword rays shuttled back and forth around Chu Kuangren, shattering the incoming cluster of clouds that were headed towards him.No matter what technique the Taixu Temple Lord used or what mysterious Transformations were formed, Chu Kuangren merely used that one sword, as if that sword was all he had.However, that one sword alone was enough to stun everyone.\u201cBy the gods, Chu Kuangren is truly capable of mentally sparring with the Taixu Temple Lord. And look at how young he is now, this is just too unbelievable.\u2019\u201cThat\u2019s right, how can someone like this exist in this world?\u201d\u201cNo wonder the three great sage orthodoxies are willing to give him protection. A sky-pride like him will possess limitless possibilities in the future!\u201dEvery onlooker was dumbfounded by that match. Some of them even took the opportunity to review their knowledge of Daoism as they watched on with a dazed look.Even the Honorables felt that they had learned something.As time went by, nearly half an hour had passed. The Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s Daoist techniques became increasingly stronger as he kept testing the bounds of Chu Kuangren\u2019s limit.\u201cBrother Chu, I\u2019m afraid your sword won\u2019t be able to stop this attack now.\u201d Feeling that time was right, the Taixu Temple Lord chuckled.Daoist Rhyme started to circulate as a large sun rose through the sea of clouds and shot out a golden ray of sunlight. It was the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s Sage Ruler Technique, Sunlight Overdrive Destruction!The golden ray of sunlight immediately shattered the sword ray and headed directly towards Chu Kuangren. When everyone saw that scene, they secretly knew that the match was ending!Being able to mentally spar with the Taixu Temple Lord was already an amazing and rare feat that Chu Kuangren had achieved in this world.However, at that moment, there was a sudden change to the Daoist Rhymes around Chu Kuangren as white lotuses began to gather together and hold down that golden ray.It was the White Lotus Light of Purification!The Taixu Temple Lord was shocked. \u201cWhat a marvelous technique. It\u2019s very similar to the School of White Lotus\u2019s Light of Purification, but is even more delicate and refined.\u201d\u201cIs this why the School of White Lotus conferred you as their Bachelor Sage?\u201dChu Kuangren did not answer. The Sword of the Heavens above his head shook as the Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique\u2019s Daoist Rhyme appeared once again and a sword ray was shot out once again.However, a golden ray of sunlight then shot out from the great sun amongst the sea of clouds once again and shattered the sword ray. The Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s Daoist techniques were too powerful.Although Chu Kuangren had the White Lotus Light of Purification, his Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique still could not breach through the Taixu Temple\u2019s defenses.\u201cGood effort, young lad.\u201d The Taixu Temple Lord uttered before he engaged the full strength of his Daoist Technique, and a domineering Daoist Rhyme pushed forth.The white lotuses around Chu Kuangren began to tremble like flowers in a violent storm, as if they would immediately shatter within the next instant.\u201cAs expected of the Honorable Supreme. Your Daoist techniques are truly remarkable.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s the furthest point I can reach?\u201dChu Kuangren held on and withstood the attack with his White Lotus Light of Purification.\u201cNo, it\u2019s still not enough.\u201d\u201cMy Daoist techniques can still be better!\u201dJust when the Taixu Temple Lord thought that the match was going to end, Chu Kuangren did something unpredictable \u2014 he slowly closed his eyes.\u201cWhat is he doing?\u201dEveryone was extremely confused.The Taixu Temple Lord frowned but he maintained his attack.At that moment, every single technique and experience that Chu Kuangren had learned in the past flashed through the depths of his mind.Gradually, the Daoist Rhyme within his body became increasingly stronger, which caused the originally near-shattering white lotus to restabilize.\u201cHow is this possible?\u201d The Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s expression suddenly changed.Then, Chu Kuangren suddenly opened his eyes and a frightening flash of light flickered in his gaze. \u201cTemple Lord, please take this technique of mine!\u201dHum!The Sword of the Heavens began to tremble before a domineering and terrifying Sword-based Daoist Rhyme swept out like a crashing tide on a stormy sea.That Sword-based Daoist Rhyme enveloped the whole Taixu Temple, causing numerous swordsmen\u2019s blades to let out an uncontrollable shriek.A single sword ray emerged from the Sword of the Heavens. Its pure Daoist Rhyme attack made the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s pupils shrink.\u201cSunlight Overdrive Destruction!\u201dAs the great sun radiated with light, a beam of sun ray shot out.However, the sun ray was brutally shattered the moment it collided with the sword ray. Like an arrow hitting its target, the sword ray shot through the sea of clouds and landed on the great sun, shattering the Daoist Rhyme Transformation.The Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s body trembled as his face was filled with shock.Chu Kuangren glanced at him calmly and asked, \u201cHow\u2019s that for a sword attack?\u201d\u201cI\u2026 I lost.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

At that moment, not a single sound was heard in the vast Taixu Temple.Everyone was so in shock that they became speechless.What had they just heard?The Taixu Temple Lord said that he \u2026 Lost?The Taixu Temple Lord lost in a mental sparring match with Chu Kuangren!\u2018He is an Honorable Supreme! How can he lose to a mere junior? This is just too unbelievable. No one will even believe it if word spreads of this.\u2019\u201cThe Temple Lord, he\u2026 Lost!\u201d\u201cHow can this be? How is it possible for Chu Kuangren to win against the Temple Lord!\u201d\u201cWhat kind of beast is he? He\u2019s only a Paradise Realm cultivator, yet you\u2019re telling me he won against an Honorable Supreme in a mental sparring match? This is defying logic!\u201d\u201cToo terrifying, he\u2019s just too terrifying.\u201d\u201cAlthough I\u2019m unwilling to accept it, what he said was true. No one could deem themselves as sky-prides before Chu Kuangren! They are all just mediocre peers.\u201dWhat followed after the silence was a wave of heated discussions.Many people were shocked yet amazed. Some were even traumatized as if they had seen a peak that was hard for them to reach in their lifetimes.In the Distant Day Palace Hall, the shocked Taixu Temple Lord looked back at Chu Kuangren after he had regained his composure and lamented. \u201cI did not expect Junior Chu to have been able to gain enlightenment at the final moment and break through the Daoist technique realms. It is truly amazing and impressive.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m afraid I won\u2019t be able to have a breakthrough at the final moment if it weren\u2019t for the Temple Lord putting such a big pressure on me.\u201d Chu Kuangren simply smiled.From his perspective, was this not how things should be naturally?After all, who went and made him into a protagonist?2Upon hearing that, the Taixu Temple Lord\u2019s mouth twitched. It meant that not only his plans were foiled, but he had inadvertently helped the enemy instead.\u201cI have gained a lot of experiences from this mental sparring match. I thank you greatly, Temple Lord.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Junior Chu. I hope you do stay a few days in Taixu Temple and I hope we can have a better chat when there\u2019s time.\u201dFrom that moment onwards, it seemed like the Taixu Temple Lord had started to view Chu Kuangren as on the same level of existence as he was, or at least it was quite so on the subject of Daoist techniques.\u201cYeah, that\u2019d be nice.\u201dChu Kuangren did not refuse as well.With that, he stayed three more days at the Taixu Temple, and during that time, besides the Taixu Temple Lord, even the other elders went to have a mental sparring match with him.In those three days, Chu Kuangren went through at least ten mental sparring matches which deeply refined his understanding of Daoist techniques as of then, and his Single Strike Technique had also improved as well.\u201cTemple Lord, I thank you for having me here for the past few days.\u201dAt the Taixu Temple\u2019s mountain gate, Chu Kuangren was preparing to leave.The Taixu Temple Lord and a crowd of elders were also there to see him off.\u201cFeel free to visit again, young junior.\u201dThe Taixu Temple Lord chuckled. Although he lost to Chu Kuangren in the mental sparring match, he did not feel any resentment at all. Instead, he was just amazed.Besides, building good relations with a sky-pride of that level would only benefit the Taixu Temple without causing any harm. Only a fool would seek to make enemies with him.\u201cJust as the mountain fields are lush and the river flows everlastingly, Temple Lord, we are bound to meet again someday in the future. Goodbye.\u201dWith that, Chu Kuangren turned and went down the mountain.Seeing his receding silhouette, the Taixu Temple Lord lamented. \u201cThis person\u2019s talents are limitless and impressive, he\u2019ll surely leave a name for himself in the annals of history.\u201d\u201cHe can even be compared with the Emperors of Old!\u201d\u2026Chu Kuangren had left the Taixu Temple since then, but in the past few days, news of him winning the Taixu Temple Lord in a mental sparring match had long spread far and wide.Every orthodoxy and their respective sky-prides all felt that the news was too unbelievable.A Paradise Realm cultivator had a mental spar with an Honorable Supreme and won?It would be too much for that to be an exaggeration.\u201cThat monster. This Chu Kuangren\u2019s not even human at all, that guy\u2019s a monster! Why don\u2019t you tell me which other sky-pride can win an Honorable Supreme in a mental sparring match?\u201d\u201cI think that this person is just too terrifyingly strong.\u201d\u201cI agree. Will Chu Kuangren not stop until he finally scares or shocks us to death? Why does every news about him seem bigger and sound crazier than the last?\u201d\u201cSheesh, so what? That guy also killed a sage before, just so you know.\u201d\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true.\u201dAlthough most people were shocked by the news, some of them were already numb to anything that concerned Chu Kuangren. In fact, they started to feel that such a thing was normal for someone like him.\u2018So what if he wins an Honorable Supreme in a mental sparring match?\u2019\u2018The guy has also killed an Honorable Supreme and even a sage in the past. Compared to all of this, winning the Taixu Temple Lord doesn\u2019t seem like a big deal to me.\u2019\u2026Within the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom.A young black-haired man was holding a news report in his hands, which contained a sorted list of the top-tiered sky-prides in Firmament Star.In that list, Chu Kuangren\u2019s name was highlighted in red.\u201cI can\u2019t believe so many years have passed by. Now that the Great Dharma Emergence is happening and the Road to the Emperor\u2019s Realm has opened, there\u2019s only a mere handful of sky-prides around?\u201d\u201cYoung Emperor? So any Paradise Realm cultivators who can defeat those in the Battle Monarch Realm are known as Young Emperors now? What a joke. These so-called Young Emperors are basically people with unworthy titles.\u201dThe young black-haired man said casually.Beside him, Master Daoist Ling Hai had a surprised look in his eyes. He could not believe what this tens of thousands of years old sky-pride was saying.However, his surprise faded away when he thought of that man\u2019s strength.\u201cOnly this Chu Kuangren person seems interesting.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s only at the Paradise Realm cultivation level, but his Daoist techniques and cultivation already surpass those of an Honorable Supreme. If this is true, then this person would also be one of the top geniuses during my time. Hehe, perhaps he might even be a fitting match for me as well.\u201d1The young black-haired man put aside the news, looked at Master Daoist Ling Hai, and said, \u201cI have slumbered for thirty thousand years. The orthodoxy that I once belonged to had since long been wiped out. I\u2019m willing to join the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom.\u201d\u201cHowever, I want the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom to fully assist me in my path to cultivation. When I become an Emperor in the future, I can guarantee that the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom will be undefeated for ten thousand years!\u201d\u201cVery well!\u201d Master Daoist Ling Hai nodded delightfully.\u201cThen I, Ao Chang, shall be a disciple of the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom!\u201dThe young black-haired man, Ao Chang said that as a fiery passion burned deep within his gaze. He had finally arrived in the Era of Great Battles!In this era, he should dominate every single opponent without fail!\u2026Within the Zhiyang Valley.A certain area within the void suddenly twisted and opened. After that, a young purple-haired man was seen walking out from it and as he did so, colorful flames swirled around him.The flames were at an extremely horrifying temperature. In a short second, it had burned down a whole nearby forest into ashes, turning everything within a hundred-mile radius into scorched earth!The young purple-haired man then slowly opened his palms, where colorful flames that were filled with an extremely horrifying Daoist Rhyme emerged.\u201cI did it!\u201d\u201cI finally managed to tame the sacred fires left by my forefathers!\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren, I, Lin Batian will not be weaker than you!\u201d\u2026Within the Black Heaven Sect.Numerous disciples received the news of Chu Kuangren winning the Taixu Temple Lord in the mental sparring match. Hence they were all proud, elated, and mad with joy.\u201cAll hail our mighty Elder Senior Brother!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s nothing. Not to mention an Honorable Supreme, I won\u2019t be surprised if our Elder Senior Brother wins against a sage for our Elder Senior Brother is just too strong.\u201d\u201cElder Senior Brother is just too powerful. We all have to work hard to be like him too.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, I shall increase my cultivation hours tomorrow.\u201d\u201cSame goes for me too.\u201d\u201cCome everyone, let\u2019s all form into groups during our cultivation session. It\u2019ll be more efficient that way.\u201dThe influence of a role model was endless.Chu Kuangren had become the definite role model for the crowd of disciples in the Black Heaven Sect. Everyone worked hard and further increased their cultivation hours to catch up to Chu Kuangren, as they intended to close the distance between them and their Elder Senior Brother. This phenomenon greatly impressed the higher-ups of the Black Heaven Sect.However, only the Honorable Xuan Qi felt a bit sad.\u201cSigh, if that boy Kuangren has managed to win against the Taixu Temple in a mental sparring match, does that mean that he\u2019s above me in terms of Daoist cultivation and techniques?\u201d\u201cThen I shall have nothing more to teach him.\u201dThe Honorable Xuan Qi sighed again in sorrow.\u2018Having such an excellent disciple is truly a troubling thing.\u2019The other elders looked at his expression and could not help but roll their eyes.\u2018Yeah sure, just continue with that act, just carry on.\u20191\u2018How can anyone not be happy and delighted to have a disciple like that? You should be so impressed and happy.\u2019Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Daoist Rhymes were circulating around the four of them.The four of them were mentally sparring together!An Honorable Supreme and two Honorables were mentally sparring with Chu Kuangren!Not long after, the Daoist Rhyme was retracted along with the countless Transformations which filled up the skies around them.\u201cI have a feeling that my Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique is at the final step before it can break through to another level. However, I feel that this last step is too hard to breakthrough.\u201dChu Kuangren said.The Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique was already a Sage Ruler Technique.Another step of progress further and it would be a legendary Emperor Technique. That was an indomitable technique that could only be developed by those in the Emperor Realm.\u201cThe Emperor Technique has actually existed for a long time. However, as the Emperors faded away one by one, the inheritance of their techniques have also broken off as well. As of now, an Emperor Technique hasn\u2019t been seen throughout tens of thousands of years.\u201d the Seventh Forefather said frustratingly.Although this was an Era of Great Battles and the Great Dharma Emergence, where the Road to Emperor\u2019s Realm has reopened, techniques like the Emperor Technique were long gone due to a break in their line of inheritance.The cultivators of this era would have to rediscover everything from the start.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. Emperor Techniques are developed by men after all. If the Emperors of Old could do it, then there\u2019s no reason that we can\u2019t.\u201dThe three protectors gazed at each other with impressed looks.Possessing superb poise, deeply refined Daoist understanding, a Daoist core that was as solid as a rock, as well as an indomitable and unyielding spirit\u2026From their perspectives, Chu Kuangren was a natural cultivator indeed.He was born to stand on top of the precipice among everyone.\u201cBachelor Sage, which orthodoxy shall we head to next?\u201dThe School of White Lotus\u2019s Protector, Honorable Qing Lan asked curiously.\u201cLet\u2019s head to the Dharma Sect then,\u201d Chu Kuangren replied.The Dharma Sect was daring enough to pride itself on its possession of\u00a0ten thousand1\u00a0techniques. Naturally, the cultivation techniques within that sect were countless and none of the other orthodoxies in the Azure Dragon Domain could ever hope to compete with that.Some even compared that if all the cultivation techniques under the skies were to be written into a series of books with ten volumes, then the Dharma Sect alone would take up eight out of the ten volumes of books for its techniques. It was obvious that the Dharma Sect had vast amounts of techniques.Since Chu Kuangren wanted to perfect his Daoist techniques, a visit to the Dharma Sect was definitely a must.\u2026In a city located at the foothills of the Dharma Sect\u2019s mountain.Since the city was backed by a sage orthodoxy like the Dharma Sect, it became very prosperous. Countless cultivators who came from different parts of the world gathered there.Both Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu had arrived at that city but decided to take a day\u2019s rest. They only planned to visit the Dharma Sect tomorrow personally.\u201cHey, the disciples from the Dharma Sect are recruiting people in public.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll go take a look then.\u201d\u201cSince the sage orthodoxy is recruiting, I better go and take a look too.\u201dAll of a sudden, the cultivators on the street were headed towards a certain direction, turning the originally hustling street to a quieter one instead.Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu exchanged gazes as they too were curious.\u201cHey, Lan Yu, let\u2019s go and see for ourselves.\u201dChu Kuangren was very interested, so he brought Lan Yu to the central square of the city and that place was already jam-packed with people by the time they arrived.There were a few stone pillars in the central square. Each of them was engraved with numerous mysterious runes and inlaid with nine pieces of gemstones.While a long queue was formed in front of the stone pillars, dozens of disciples from the Dharma Sect could be seen managing the crowd and order there.\u201cAlright, next,\u201d one of the Dharma Sect\u2019s disciples announced.A cultivator was seen walking towards the stone pillar before he placed his hand on it and the gemstones on the stone pillars gradually lit up one by one. One\u2026 Two\u2026A total of four gemstones turned bright.The cultivator had a disappointed look on his face when he saw that.\u201cFour Stars, you\u2019re unqualified. Please leave.\u201dThe Dharma Sect\u2019s disciple said with an indifferent tone.Chu Kuangren then stood behind the crowd and took a few observations. He noticed that most of the cultivators could only light up three or four gemstones.Only those who could light up five of more gemstones were qualified to be recruited.However, that was just the first trial of their recruitment process.\u201cThis pillar, what kind of item is this?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked curiously.\u201cThis is a type of treasure item which has been specifically developed by the Dharma Sect to test a cultivator\u2019s qualification.\u201d That time, a voice suddenly came from beside Chu Kuangren.A young man in a white robe walked to Chu Kuangren and chuckled. \u201cThis item separates the qualifications of all the sky-prides in the world into nine categories. Only the top-tiered cultivators can light up seven or even eight gemstones upon that pillar.\u201d\u201cThose with a weak qualification can most probably only light up one gemstone.\u201dThe young man in white robe explained passionately.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, aren\u2019t four stars considered not bad then?\u201dChu Kuangren said.\u201cYou\u2019re right. People with four-star qualifications can be deemed a young genius within some Honorable Orthodoxies. But too bad that joining the Dharma Sect isn\u2019t so easy. The disciples who are recruited into the Dharma Sect must at least be able to light up five gemstones.\u201d\u201cBesides, qualifications are only the first trial in the recruitment process. The later trials focus on different aspects like Daoist understanding, Daoist core, and more. The requirements in this process are very strict.\u201dThe young man in white robe seemed to be very well versed in the trials that were conducted by the Dharma Sect. It was as if he was explaining the items he had at home. Even Chu Kuangren could not help but look at him attentively.He then used the Eye of Revelation.\u201cSu Tianyi, a disciple of the Dharma Sect, cultivation level \u2013 Paradise Realm, cultivated Sage Technique \u2013 Sixfold Order Eightfold Chaos Technique, cultivated Sage Technique \u2013 Transcendent Coalescence\u2026\u201dA look of surprise was revealed in Chu Kuangren\u2019s eyes.That guy was a disciple of the Dharma Sect and with the Eye of Revelation\u2019s analysis, his combat strength could be said to be on par or if not stronger than Yuanhong as well.\u201cFellow Daoist, you must be here for recruitment right? Come, there\u2019s no need to trouble yourself waiting in that line of the queue. I\u2019ll take you to the test immediately.\u201dSu Tianyi dragged Chu Kuangren towards the front of the crowd.Even Chu Kuangren was dazed.When did he ever say he wanted to take the test?\u201cFellow Daoist, I\u2026\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s fine, I know you don\u2019t want to cut queues, but I\u2019m the one in charge of this station. There\u2019ll be no problem if it\u2019s fine with me.\u201d Su Tianyi immediately interrupted Chu Kuangren\u2019s sentence with a \u2018don\u2019t worry, let me handle it\u2019 look.Not waiting for Chu Kuangren to say anything more, he dragged both of them in front of the stone pillar. He said as he looked towards another fellow disciple, \u201cLet them have a try first.\u201d\u201cYes, of course.\u201dThe other disciple nodded and was instantly marveled when he saw both Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu. \u2018What the heck, these two are just too attractive.\u2019Some people in the crowd were unsatisfied upon seeing that someone was cutting the queue. However, once they took a look at Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu, that dissatisfaction immediately disappeared and turned to marvel.\u201cWhere did these two come from? They do seem very extraordinary to me.\u201d\u201cTsk, having special treatment because of their good looks huh.\u201d\u201cDamn this world that prioritizes one\u2019s appearance\u2026\u201d\u2026\u201cGo ahead, fellow Daoist,\u201d the Dharma Sect\u2019s disciple said.Chu Kuangren looked at the stone pillar and hesitated for a while before he put out his hand. He was also curious as to how many gemstones he could light up.Yet the moment he placed his hand on the stone pillar, he felt a surge of energy release from the stone pillar and swept through his whole body.Following that, the gemstones on the pillars lit up one by one.One, two, three, four, five\u2026\u201cI see, it is as I expected. My fellow Daoist brother, you already have an amazingly gorgeous appearance, so I bet your qualifications wouldn\u2019t be too bad either.\u201dSu Tianyi looked like he had expected it.However, his expression immediately turned into astonishment.That was because all nine gemstones had lit up on the stone pillar just as he was done speaking. \u2018A nine-star qualification?\u2019The nine pieces of gemstones radiated brightly, attracting the gazes of everyone in the crowd. Shocked exclamations were soon heard, one after another.\u201cBloody hell, a nine-star qualification! Qualifications like this have not existed within the Dharma Sect for far too many years! This is just too shocking and amazing!\u201d\u201cThis is not a matter of how many years, but instead, it dates back to the time where this stone test pillar was invented by the Dharma Sect long ago. Ever since then, no one has been able to light up all nine gemstones!\u201d\u201cMy God, who the hell is this person?\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s nine pieces of gemstones. What a terrifyingly strong qualification this is!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

However, he never once thought that Chu Kuangren was such a powerhouse.\u2018A nine-star qualification!\u2019One should know that Su Tianyi himself had an eight-star qualification, and he was already regarded as one of the most impressive people in the Dharma Sect\u2019s history.To what extent could Chu Kuangren\u2019s nine-star qualification achieve?\u2018The Dharma Sect has found a valuable treasure today!\u2019\u201cNine-star qualification?\u201dChu Kuangren was not surprised at the results as he whispered to himself.If top-tiered sky-prides had seven- or even eight-star qualification, then it was not surprising for a peerless sky-pride like him, who had beaten up Young Emperors, to get a nine-star qualification.Just when he thought that was his qualification level, something strange happened.The light on the stone pillar started to get even brighter while the runes engraved on it started to flash. Then, a few cracks started to appear on the pillar.With a crash, the stone test pillar was instantly shattered!\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d Chu Kuangren was a bit dazed.Did that mean his qualifications exceeded nine stars?Did the stone test pillar rupture because it could not take proper measurements?Meanwhile, Su Tianyi and the others were stunned.\u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d\u201cI have never seen such a thing happen before.\u201d\u201cCan it be that this stone pillar has fallen into disrepair after many years of negligence, which is why it went out of order?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s possible.\u201dEveryone at the scene breathed a sigh of relief.\u2018So it turns out to be a malfunction.\u2019They had really thought that a monster with nine-star qualifications had appeared.\u201cFellow Daoist, let\u2019s use another stone pillar for the test,\u201d the Dharma Sect\u2019s disciple said.Chu Kuangren nodded and placed his hand on the other stone pillar.Similar to earlier, nine pieces of gemstones lit up brightly before the light became increasingly brighter and the stone pillar cracked open and shattered before the crowd\u2019s horrified gaze.Everyone was dumbfounded.\u201cIs there a problem with this one as well? Why don\u2019t I use another stone pillar?\u201dChu Kuangren then headed towards the next stone pillar.\u201cStop!\u201d\u201cFellow Daoist, please stop!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you come over here!\u201d The other disciple who was overseeing the other pillar hurriedly stopped Chu Kuangren\u2019s way and yelled.\u2018Are you kidding me?\u2019They had finally understood that the problem was not with the stone test pillar but that person, Chu Kuangren!Everyone was absolutely dumbfounded.\u2018What kind of monster is this?\u2019\u2018I can\u2019t believe his qualifications are so high that it exceeds the limits of endurance for the stone testing pillar. This person is much stronger than the disciples from the other great orthodoxies.\u2019\u201cFellow Daoist, please, there\u2019s no need for you to test anymore, you have passed the first trial.\u201dSu Tianyi gulped and said.Speaking to the disciple next to him, he said, \u201cAll of you stay here and oversee the first trial of recruitment. In the meantime, I shall bring the ones who had passed over to the second trial.\u201d\u201cAlright, Senior Brother.\u201d\u201cBy the way, how should I address you, fellow Daoist?\u201d\u201cMy first name is Chu.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019re Brother Chu then. Alright, allow me to explain the second trial now. It\u2019s a trial that assesses your understanding of techniques. Within the Dharma Sect there lies a stele forest. Inside that forest, thousands of techniques were recorded there\u2026\u201dSu Tianyi went on explaining about that trial.Chu Kuangren was just about to explain himself when he heard that and something then flicked within his heart.\u2018A stele forest that holds the records of thousands of techniques?\u2019\u2018Now that is interesting indeed.\u2019Hence, Chu Kuangren decided to go there first to take a look.\u201cBy the way, fellow Daoist, why don\u2019t you test your qualifications as well?\u201dSu Tianyi then looked at Lan Yu who was beside Chu Kuangren.Lan Yu nodded slightly, walked over to a stone pillar, and placed her hand on it. Within a moment, all nine pieces of gemstones lit up brightly.That scene once again shocked everyone.\u2018Bloody Hell!\u2019\u2018Another monster!\u2019Everyone fixed their eyes on the stone pillar, fearing that it would shatter and crumble as well.Fortunately, the stone pillar remained intact despite its nine gemstones shining ever so brightly. With that, everyone sighed in relief.Only then did they return to their senses. \u2018This person is a nine-star qualification monster as well!\u2019\u2018And that Brother Chu too\u2026\u2019\u2018My God, where do these people come from?\u2019\u201cMy fellow Daoist, your qualifications are very impressive indeed. It\u2019s truly worth admiring.\u201d Su Tianyi gulped. He felt like today was a bit too surreal.He had encountered two monsters that possessed abnormally strong qualifications!Su Tianyi then brought Chu Kuangren, Lan Yu, and the other cultivators who had passed the first trial to the Dharma Sect.Within a peculiar stele forest in the Dharma Sect.Countless stone tablets stood firm atop the ground with a great number of runes carved onto them. Every piece of stone tablet represented a type of cultivation technique inside the stele forest.\u201cWhat a majestic looking stele forest!\u201d\u201cEvery stone tablet here represents a type of cultivation technique. By the gods, only the Dharma Sect can find and possess so many of them.\u201d1\u201cIt\u2019s very wonderful and powerful indeed.\u201d\u201cTruly worthy of a sage orthodoxy. Their foundations are too strong.\u201d\u201cI agree. Is this the second trial then?\u201dSimilar to the others, Chu Kuangren was baffled as well.Using his spiritual thoughts to do a rough scan of the area around him, he found out that there were at least eight thousand stone tablets in the forest, which meant that there were at least eight thousand techniques around them!Even the Black Heaven Sect could not hope to come up with so many techniques.Although all the techniques here were below the level of a Supreme Technique, the fact that there were so many was shocking enough. The Dharma Sect truly deserved that name.\u201cThe second trial requires you to gain insights on one of the techniques inscribed on any stone tablet of your choosing. You must complete this task within three days!\u201d\u201cIf you fail to do so, you shall be disqualified.\u201dSu Tianyi said.Everyone looked at each other, some dumbfounded by what they heard.\u201cAre you kidding me? Even if it\u2019s the most general technique, being able to see results within three days is just crazy. How is this possible?\u201d\u201cWhere can anyone with such levels of understanding ever exist in this world?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right, this is impossible.\u201d\u201cThis trial is just too hard.\u201d\u201cI agree\u2026\u201dFacing the crowd\u2019s questions, Su Tianyi sneered. \u201cThe Dharma Sect has a hundred\u00a0thousand disciples and every single one of them has managed to pass this trial.\u201d\u201cWhile the more outstanding among them even managed to gain insights on ten techniques within three days, so don\u2019t use your own weakness as an excuse. If you want to take the trial, just stay. If not, then leave. No one\u2019s forcing you to do this.\u201dNo one was willing to leave.Even the cultivators who felt that the trial was hard only murmured. Since they were already here, why not give it a go then?\u201cIf that\u2019s the case, then let the trial begin.\u201dWhen Su Tianyi was done speaking, he smiled at Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu. \u201cBased on your qualifications, I suppose it will not be a problem for you both. I shall await the good news from you two.\u201dAlthough qualifications were not the same thing as understanding or gaining insights, generally speaking, a cultivator with good qualifications would not be that bad in terms of gaining insights as well.After Su Tianyi left, Chu Kuangren looked at the countless stone tablets before him and smiled. \u201cThis stele forest is an interesting place.\u201dAs his spiritual thoughts did a sweep and scanned through each of the stone tablets, Chu Kuangren started to gain insights.All those techniques may not be useful to Chu Kuangren, but they were countless in quantity and that was the advantage.Besides, the techniques were various in kind and different in forms. It would be beneficial to Chu Kuangren in helping him with his Single Strike Technique.Just when Chu Kuangren was starting to gain insights on the techniques, Lan Yu immediately entered a state of alert and stood guard around him. She wanted to prevent him from being disturbed by anyone.\u201cYoung lady, there are plenty of techniques around this forest. Why don\u2019t you let us stand guard over the kid while you go and gain insights from some of them if you want.\u201dWithin the void, Honorable Qing Lan\u2019s voice was heard.\u201cThere\u2019s no need.\u201dLan Yu shook her head because after all, she already had her Daoist techniques. Besides, gaining insights on a few more techniques would not bring many benefits to her at all.Moreover, from her perspective, even if one has thousands of techniques, how could they compare to Chu Kuangren\u2019s single strand of hair?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Which one of them should we choose?\u201d\u201cI agree, this is just too troublesome.\u201d\u201cSighs, this is too hard.\u201d\u201cIf we have to show results within three days, then it\u2019s not advisable to go for the harder and more advanced cultivation techniques. We can only choose the easier ones.\u201d\u201cThen let\u2019s go with the low-tier techniques then.\u201d\u201cWill the complexity of the technique we choose affect the results of this trial? Does that mean the more advanced the technique, the higher our grades will be, and it\u2019ll be the opposite for weaker techniques too?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019d need to choose properly if that\u2019s the case.\u201d\u201cNo matter what, we should make a plan while taking our capabilities into consideration. Remember, we only have three days to do this.\u201dInside the stele forest, the cultivators were stressing out on which technique they should gain insights into.The number of cultivation techniques before them was just too plenty. Besides, there were all sorts of techniques that could be commonly found in the other schools of cultivation as well.Some of them looked at Chu Kuangren and Lan Yu. Due to how crazy and horrifying their qualifications were, it had created lasting impressions within their minds.They were curious to find out which cultivation techniques those two would choose.However, everyone was stunned when they looked over.Chu Kuangren was standing still with his eyes closed, while Lan Yu was standing beside him unmoved as well. She did not have the slightest intent to gain insights into any of the techniques on the stone tablets at all.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with them?\u201d\u201cDid both of them decide not to do the trial?\u201dEveryone was puzzled, but they stopped bothering about them after a while. Now that they were busy with passing the trial, they had no time to care about Chu Kuangren.Eventually, everyone chose a technique to gain insights on.Only a few of them were left deliberating as they struggled to make a choice.While everyone was busy choosing, Chu Kuangren had already wandered off into the sea of Daoist techniques. As his spiritual thoughts spread far and wide, the various techniques inscribed on the stone tablets appeared within the depths of his mind, and one by one, Chu Kuangren proceeded to gain insights into them at a rapid pace.His Meditational Clarity Trait was utilized to its full extent!Ten, twenty, thirty, fifty \u2026A hundred, three hundred, five hundred\u2026It seemed like all Chu Kuangren had to do was glance upon the techniques once before he would gain insights into them. The whole process took no more than ten seconds.As he gained insights on more and more techniques, his level of understanding started to deepen, and in turn, the speed at which he gained insights began to increase as well.Various types of Daoist Rhymes soon started to form and swirl around Chu Kuangren\u2019s body. They include the Five Way Daoist Rhymes namely gold, wood, water, fire, earth, and also the Four Mystic Daoist Rhymes of ground, air, water, and flame.There was also an extremely sharp Sword-based Daoist Rhyme among the techniques.Moreover, the majestic palm technique which contained the Daoist Rhyme of rivers and mountains was also one of the techniques there.There was even the all-changing finger technique and a long-range sword technique which\u2026Multiple types of Daoist Rhymes and techniques were all swirling around Chu Kuangren\u2019s body. It was so majestic, beautiful, and brilliant like a feast of Daoist techniques.As the Daoist Rhymes became stronger and denser, multiple Transformations also materialized.In the void, there were imaginary mountains and rivers, sword Qi everywhere, a massacre, violent winds, raging storms, icicle hails\u2026The Daoist Rhymes which took form startled the other cultivators who were gaining insights from the stone tablet techniques. They all looked towards Chu Kuangren with shock in their eyes.\u201cHoly sh*t, what the hell is this?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s he doing!\u201d\u201cWhy are there so many Daoist Rhymes and Transformations?\u201dEveryone was astonished yet dumbfounded at the same time.On the other hand, a brilliant white light radiated from Lan Yu\u2019s body. With a shiny and gorgeous silver-white armor on, her chilling gaze swept through the area as she firmly stood guard.At that moment, no matter who they were, anyone who dared approach Chu Kuangren would be met with Lan Yu\u2019s most powerful attack.Not only did the Daoist Rhyme and Transformations that Chu Kuangren emitted, having gained insights into the thousands of techniques, alarm the cultivators inside the stele forest, but it too affected more than half of the area surrounding the Dharma Sect.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on, why is a Daoist Rhyme like this here?\u201d\u201cAn assortment of Daoist Rhymes?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s coming from the stele forest. Did something happen?\u201dThe higher-ups and elders of the Dharma Sect were all concerned and unsure, so they quickly headed to the stele forest to find out what was happening.At that time outside the stele forest, Su Tianyi and a few other disciples were discussing the current trial. They were wondering how fast it would take this time.\u201cFrom what I can see, it\u2019ll take at least one day I guess.\u201d\u201cI agree. During the previous trials, which include the one that Senior Brother Su took part in, even the fastest one took three hours to complete.\u201d\u201cAlthough they were generally common techniques, most cultivators will require a few or even up to ten years to study them if they don\u2019t have a certain level of understanding.\u201dSu Tianyi and the others continued their discussion.When it came to cultivation, not only was a person\u2019s mere foundation key, but their understanding played an important part as well.If there was no understanding, one would require ten days or more to produce results, while a normal person only required one day to achieve the same thing. It meant that those without proper understanding would be limited in what they could achieve in the end.\u201cHuh? Something\u2019s happening inside.\u201dSu Tianyi\u2019s expression suddenly changed into a frown.Just when the few of them were surprised, a heavy surge of Daoist Rhyme erupted from within the stele forest and multiple Transformations started to form in the surrounding void.\u201cMy\u2026 My god, what in the world is happening?\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s happening inside there?\u201dSu Tianyi and the others rushed into the stele forest.Just when they were about to set foot in it, the higher-ups and elders from the Dharma Sect had arrived too.Everyone looked at each other when they saw Chu Kuangren who was under the Transformation.\u201cBrother Su, what is going on here?\u201d One of the elders looked at Su Tianyi and asked curiously.Su Tianyi shook his head. \u201cElder, I\u2019m not sure as well. This person is one of the disciples who\u2019s taking the recruitment trial. His qualification was so outstanding that even the stone test pillar could not measure it.\u201dAt that, a few of the elders became bewildered.\u201cYou mention that he\u2019s one of the disciples taking the trial?\u201d That time, an old man who was walking forward from the crowd asked with a very weird tone.\u201cYes.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d That old man laughed as he shook his head.\u201cDo you know who he is, elder?\u201d\u201cYes, I do. Even if you haven\u2019t met him before, I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve all heard his name before. His name\u2026 is Chu Kuangren!\u201d said that old man.He had met Chu Kuangren before during the exploration to the Luminous Moon Secret Realm. He had also heard the news about Chu Kuangren visiting the various great orthodoxies. So regarding his sudden appearance here, the elder was a little shocked but he was not completely surprised.\u2018Chu Kuangren\u2026\u2019The moment those words came out, everyone at the scene gasped.\u201cSo he\u2019s Chu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cMy god, I\u2019ve finally met Chu Kuangren.\u201d\u201cPossessing such a fairy-like appearance, the rumors about Chu Kuangren are true. I can\u2019t believe that\u2019s really him.\u201dIf one were to ask who was the most renowned person in the Azure Dragon Domain, who could it be?Undoubtedly, that person would be the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s Elder Senior Brother, Chu Kuangren!\u2018Declaring war on the world, killing an Honorable Supreme, slaying a sage, becoming the Azure Dynasty\u2019s Royal Princess\u2019s fianc\u00e9, becoming the new White Lotus Bachelor Sage, and even winning against the Taixu Temple Lord in a mental sparring match\u2026\u2019Any of those accomplishments were already shocking enough for everyone, not to mention every single accomplishment was achieved by a single person.Su Tianyi was full of shock. \u201cThat guy is Chu Kuangren?\u201d\u201cYes, that\u2019s him.\u201d Sure of himself, the elder nodded.\u201cThen what\u2019s he doing now?\u201dThe old man then cautiously observed Chu Kuangren for a while. Immediately after, the old man was so astonished that his body trembled. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to gain insights into the techniques inscribed in the stele forest! Not just one or two of them, but all of the techniques in here!\u201d\u201cHow\u2019s this possible?\u201dThe moment he said that, everyone present thought it was unbelievable.\u2018How many techniques are there in the stele forest?\u2019\u2018At least eight thousand!\u2019\u2018Even the Dharma Sect\u2019s Master himself may not know half of the techniques in this stele forest, yet you\u2019re telling me that Chu Kuangren is trying to gain insights into every single one of them here?\u2019\u2018Such a thing is simply preposterous!\u2019\u2018No one will even believe this if we tell them!\u2019\u201cElder, are you messing with us?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Although they remained silent, it was clear from their expression that they had the same thought.The stele forest had at least eight thousand cultivation techniques, in which ordinary cultivators may not even obtain one percent of all eight thousand throughout their whole lives.So how could they believe the elder\u2019s words that Chu Kuangren was uncovering all the techniques within the stele forest?\u201cI know this is all very unbelievable, but common sense doesn\u2019t seem to apply to him. It\u2019s fascinating.\u201d\u201cTake a closer look at him. The Daoist Rhymes that are coming from Chu Kuangren are resonating perfectly with the recorded techniques in the stele forest.\u201dOnly when the elder had finished speaking did the crowd take a good look at Chu Kuangren.With one look, many people\u2019s expressions quickly changed.\u201cThis gentle Daoist Rhyme is\u2026 the magical top-tier Soft Cloud Sleeve?!\u201d\u201cAs swift as the wind but silent as a mountain; it\u2019s the Sword of Mystery Mountain!\u201d\u201cOne more! A magical top-tier Thunder Burst Palm!\u201d\u201cKing Kong Fist, Demon-head Blade, Nine Heavens Sword Technique\u2026 Goodness. Even these top-tier techniques are in there.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s simply too many!\u201d\u201cMy head is spinning from looking at the countless number of techniques.\u201d\u201cBut for him to find every technique in the stele forest? Something like this is incomprehensible! Just how does he do it?\u201dThe Dharmas Sect\u2019s cultivators were all stunned.What they saw was like a dream to them. How on earth could someone comprehend so many techniques at once? Not to mention, it was all within the same day!\u201cFour thousand six hundred and thirteen Daoist Rhymes. Wait, there are four thousand six hundred and fourteen now! The number is rising so rapidly, and he\u2019s still so quick in uncovering the other recorded techniques in the stele forest!Some Dharmas Sect\u2019s cultivators carefully counted the number of Daoist Rhymes that were coming from Chu Kuangren, but every time they finished, the number would increase again.Such speed in gaining insights into techniques was terrifying.So much so that one had to see it to believe it.\u201cHe isn\u2019t just simply acquiring the technique too. Based on the level of those Daoist Rhymes, I\u2019m afraid he has already mastered them.\u201d The elder\u2019s voice trembled.\u201cImpossible! I refuse to believe it!\u201d\u201cI come to the stele forest every day for eight hours, be it day or night, rain or shine. But even I have only mastered less than a hundred techniques! How could he acquire all eight thousand in a day?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no way! I just can\u2019t believe it!\u201dA young cultivator was shaken to his Daoist core by what he saw as his expression turned to one of insanity, and he fell into a demonic state.He wanted to rush out and ask Chu Kuangren just why he was not even close to the level that Chu Kuangren was at in a day despite having cultivated for thousands of years.Why?!Lan Yu stepped forth with a chilly glare while her Daoist Rhymes circulated and her spiritual power was ready to attack at any moment.However, the Dharmas Sect\u2019s elders were quicker. They caught the young lad and threw him out of the stele forest.\u201cSigh. Even I feel like my lifelong dedication to cultivation is pointless when I see this, let alone the younger ones.\u201d The elder sighed.\u201cIt\u2019s best they avoid the stele forest to cool off for now, lest their Daoist core crumbles and destroys them.\u201d\u201cYes, keep them away from Chu Kuangren.\u201dAn elder said as he glanced at the void.They knew that even without them around, Chu Kuangren\u2019s protectors were in the shadows and would not let anyone near him.However, knowing was one thing, and acting on the knowledge was another.It was better to act innocent and show them their goodwill in this manner.\u201cTruly amazing.\u201dAn emotion-filled sigh came from the void before a grey-robed, white-haired elder walked into the stele forest.The crowd immediately bowed when they saw him.\u201cGreetings, Sect Master.\u201dThis man was the Sect Master of the Dharma Sect.\u201cYes\u2026 Let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d The Sect Master nodded slightly, his gaze never leaving Chu Kuangren.As time passed, the transformations within the stele forest never ceased and the speed of the Daoist Rhymes on Chu Kuangren increased rapidly.His Meditational Clarity Trait was so powerful that he might even be able to uncover a Sage Ruler Technique like the White Lotus Light of Purification that quickly. Not to mention that within the stele forest were merely some methods which could not compare to Supreme Techniques.The number may be large, but understanding it all was simple for Chu Kuangren.Five thousand, six thousand, seven thousand\u2026Eight thousand one hundred and thirty-six!Soon enough, Chu Kuangren had over eight thousand one hundred and thirty-six Daoist Rhymes on him. It also meant that he had learned eight thousand one hundred and thirty-six methods.What they were witnessing was unprecedented!\u201cHe- He actually learned all the methods!\u201d Some higher-ups from the Dharma Sect swallowed as their Daoist cores shook.The other cultivators were in the same state of speechless shock.It was simply terrifying.They had heard plenty of stories about Chu Kuangren, but stories were just stories. It could never be as shocking as seeing it for themselves.He had acquired eight thousand methods in the stele forest in less than a day!Was this possible for a mere mortal?If someone said Chu Kuangren was the Emperor, no doubt people would believe it, or perhaps only the great Emperors from the old rumors had such an ability.Once Chu Kuangren had acquired every ability, the Daoist Rhymes within the void transformed and retreated as quickly as an ocean tide.Then, his body burst into a brilliant light, with runes seemingly circulating his body. It was very mysterious.\u201cTranscendent Coalescence Daoist Physique!\u201dOne of the elders exclaimed.However, the others were flabbergasted. The Transcendent Coalescence Daoist Physique was an ancient and supreme Daoist Physique that ranked the best out of three thousand others.Even the Exquisite Nine Orifices Sword Heart was below it.Legend had it that those with such a supreme Daoist Physique could use themselves as a furnace to smelt things, which was a terrifying feat indeed.\u201cNo, this isn\u2019t the real Transcendent Coalescence Daoist Physique, but there are some similar Daoist Rhymes within. If he continues like this, he\u2019ll one day obtain a Supreme Daoist Physique!\u201dThe Dharma Sect Master gasped.A Daoist Physique was naturally obtained and even though one could train for it, it was insanely difficult. Very few people in history had achieved it, let alone a supreme Daoist Physique.An absurd thought came to mind as the crowd looked at Chu Kuangren \u2014 perhaps someone like him could pull it off.The divine light and runes converged before Chu Kuangren returned to his usual princely appearance once again.He let out a satisfied smile the moment he opened his eyes. The stele forest\u2019s eight thousand methods were very helpful.There was a huge improvement in his Single Strike Technique!\u201cNow I just need to find the time to fuse everything from today into my Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique and perfect it again,\u201d Chu Kuangren muttered.He may have cultivated only one technique, but it was one that surpassed everything else.Indeed, it was the Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique!Upon gathering his thoughts, he looked over to where the Sect Master, as well as the others, were before he walked over. He bowed and greeted, \u201cGreetings, Sect Master. I am Chu Kuangren. I apologize for any offenses I have caused upon visiting the Dharma Sect.\u201dEveryone looked at him with a conflicted look in their eyes.Out of everyone, the Sect Master was the first to return to his senses. He smiled calmly. \u201cIt is an honor that you would visit us, Junior Chu. The Dharma Sect doesn\u2019t get visitors very often.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

The Dharma Sect doesn\u2019t get visitors very often.\u201dThe Sect Master smiled calmly.\u201cAs long as the Sect Master doesn\u2019t find me a nuisance, I\u2019m glad.\u201d\u201cHehe, not at all. Let us find somewhere more suitable to talk. Please, come with me.\u201d The Sect Master then led Chu Kuangren away from the stele forest.Once they were out of the stele forest, the disciples that were hit the hardest stared at Chu Kuangren with a conflicted look in their eyes.It was shock, unwillingness, envy, worship, and more.Acquiring all eight thousand methods in half a day was like a myth to them.If Chu Kuangren could achieve this, then what was he?A deity?Regardless of what he was, it was something unattainable to them.\u201cBrother Chu, You\u2019re killing me here.\u201d Su Tianyi looked at him with a bitter smile.Initially, he thought that the Dharma Sect had found a peerless wizard, but he did not think that things would turn out this way.1\u201cApologies for not informing in advance.\u201d Chu Kuangren smiled plainly. He wanted to see the stele forest, so he did not reveal himself.\u201cI\u2019m also dumb for not being able to foresee this. With that aura, there is no way you\u2019re a regular person. Anyone could have guessed it if they gave it more thought.\u201dSu Tianyi shook his head but ceased his complaints.The group headed to the Dharma Sect\u2019s palace.Chu Kuangren did not beat around the bush as he said what came to mind, expressing that he wanted to spar with the Dharma Sect and solidify what he had learned.\u201cI heard that the lord of the Taixu Temple lost to you in terms of Dao techniques and this piqued my interest. Since Junior Chu wants to spar as well, allow me to begin.\u201d The Sect Master smiled.Several elders in the hall hesitated initially, but when they thought about it, they could not think of reasons to object.If Chu Kuangren was considered a junior and the Sect Master an Honorable Supreme, it would not be unreasonable to say that this was bullying.Yet in this case, that was bullsh*t.After witnessing him acquire all eight thousand methods in half a day, who still dared to treat him as a regular disciple?Moreover, even the Taixu Temple\u2019s lord lost to Kuangren. So for the Sect Master to personally spar with him was nothing unexpected.News of the Sect Master\u2019s spar eventually spread throughout the Dharma Sect, sparking discussions among many cultivators who became highly anticipated of it.The next day.Chu Kuangren and the Dharma Sect Master stood atop a high platform after an incense bath, where countless disciples crowded to watch the spar.\u201cPlease.\u201d The Sect Master smiled.Chu Kuangren was not one to care about courtesies at a ceremony. Despite having acquired the stele forest\u2019s eight thousand methods, he still relied on his old and thoroughly-mastered sword Dao.The Sword of The Heavens appeared as its Daoist Rhyme emitted.With a flash of a sword ray, it headed straight for the Sect Master.As an Honorable Supreme of the Azure Dragon Domain, the Dharma Sect Master had a very profound understanding of sword Dao.Daoist Rhymes surrounded him \u2014 various mysterious techniques at the ready \u2014 and with an effortless flick of his sleeve, he blocked the sword ray.The crowd gasped in amazement.\u201cAs expected, the Sect Master is untouchable!\u201d\u201cSo strong.\u201d\u201cAre these the Dao techniques of an Honorable Supreme? Amazing.\u201dNumerous disciples watched in devoted awe.However, some elders had a solemn look on their faces. Only they could tell that the Sect Master had used at least ten techniques in that simple sleeve flick.\u201cSo strong\u2026 Chu Kuangren\u2019s Dao techniques are terrifying!\u201d\u201cHis very first strike made the Sect Master pull everything out to block it. His mastery over sword Dao and sword techniques are as profound as Honorable Xuan Qi.\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren\u2026 good for you.\u201dThe elders exchanged some solemn glances before they turned their gazes to the platform. They did not look away after that.\u201cJunior Chu\u2019s grasp on Dao techniques is extremely profound. I\u2019m impressed,\u201d the Sect Master spoke plainly, but a spark in him had been lit.The two then continued to spar on the platform, going back and forth.One would raise a hand and a method would manifest on their fingertips before a breathtaking Daoist Rhyme surrounded their body. It was gorgeous and ever-changing.Not to mention that one of them only had a single sword and an extremely simple one at that, but its edges were boundless and second to none.A single strike could breakthrough thousands of methods!Be it a Dharma Sect\u2019s Honorable sage or Chu Kuangren, both of their Dao techniques were highly refined and could be considered the best of the best.The crowd was intoxicated with watching them spar. Some even used this chance to reaffirm their own Dao techniques.Time passed quickly as the day turned to night, and night turned to day.The spar continued for a full day and a night.Chu Kuangren had defeated the Taixu Temple\u2019s lord in terms of Dao techniques, but now that he had the stele forest\u2019s eight thousand methods, his power grew even more.Although the Dharma Sect Master was slightly stronger than the Taixu Temple\u2019s lord, he was still defeated at the end of the day.As the sun began to rise, its golden rays shone on Chu Kuangren\u2019s body, which made it look like a golden coat was bestowed upon him. It also highlighted his refined aura even more vividly.\u201cMaster, do you admit defeat?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked calmly.The Sect Master looked at him and said nothing for a brief moment before he started to laugh. \u201cGood job, Chu Kuangren. In terms of Dao techniques, you\u2019re essentially invincible except to the sages. I gladly accept this defeat!\u201dInvincible except to the sages?!Everyone\u2019s eyes widened upon hearing that statement and they stared at Chu Kuangren in disbelief. To think he had attained this level of power!\u201cA sage, huh?\u201d Chu Kuangren muttered before softly laughing. \u201cIt won\u2019t be long before I search for a sage to spar with.\u201dIndeed.With his Meditational Clarity Trait, he could quickly acquire various techniques. Besides, his Roulette room would allow his abilities to improve at an alarmingly fast rate.Very soon, he could definitely spar with a sage.No. It would not be much of a spar.He would win hands down.Chu Kuangren\u2019s words left the crowd reeling in disbelief, so much that they were stunned into silence.Sparring with a sage?Even an Honorable Supreme would not dare to think of such a thing.Disregarding the fact that Chu Kuangren could look for a sage to spar, sages and Honorable Supremes differed vastly since a sage\u2019s comprehension of Daoist techniques were on a different level.Many years ago, an Honorable Supreme once challenged a sage, but alas, they lasted less than a minute.The sage even went easy on them.\u201cChu Kuangren, perhaps that was a little arrogant. The difference between an Honorable Supreme and a sage is far bigger than you can imagine!\u201d\u201cWell, he is still young and bold.\u201d\u201cHow naive of you to think that you can win against a sage just because you beat an Honorable Supreme.\u201d\u201cBesides, how many sages exist in the world? Most of them are Supreme Giants that hide behind the sage orthodoxies. Meeting them is hard enough, let alone sparring with them.\u201dSome people started to discuss in low voices.The Dharma Sect Master smiled at Chu Kuangren. \u201cYou certainly do live up to your name as a madman, but it is not a problem. It\u2019s normal for youngsters to live life on the edge.\u201d\u201cBesides, all cultivators should have such aspirations!\u201dAs the saying went, those that do not strive to be sages were not good cultivators. Every cultivator in the world held the same aspirations as Chu Kuangren.However, it\u2019s a pity that most dare not say it out loud.Chu Kuangren, on the other hand, had guts!After all, if you spoke of your dream as your reality, it would surely come true.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Go on,\u201d the Sect Master simply said.\u201cThe Dharma Sect has the most techniques out of all the other Sects in the Azure Dragon Domain. The stele forest may only have methods, albeit eight thousand of it, but I\u2019m sure plenty of Supreme Techniques and Sage Techniques also exist. Hence, I would like to take a look.\u201dChu Kuangren smiled as he said.The stele forest\u2019s eight thousand methods were only used to assess disciples. After all, why would the Dharma Sect reveal its secrets so easily to other people?Once those words left Chu Kuangren\u2019s mouth, the faces of the elders present turned dark. They looked at Chu Kuangren with slight hostility.\u201cJunior Chu, remember your place!\u201d\u201cExactly! Supreme Techniques and Sage Techniques are the foundation of a sage orthodoxy. How could we just show it to you for no reason?!\u201d\u201cTsk, this request is simply too much.\u201dThe Sect Master\u2019s smile had vanished as well, but he believed that Chu Kuangren would not request something like this for no reason.\u201cJunior Chu, what do you have to offer in return?\u201d\u201cAh, Master is indeed sharp.\u201dWith a smile on Chu Kuangren\u2019s face, a magical and concentrated Daoist Rhyme began to manifest and gather in the void into an ancient mountain.Everyone gasped at the Daoist Rhyme.\u201cSuch a strong and mysterious technique!\u201d\u201cThis is\u2026 a Sage Technique!\u201d\u201cWell, it\u2019s certainly a kind of Sage Technique, but there are only so many Sage Techniques within our Firmament Star\u2019s sage orthodoxies. Why have I never seen this before?\u201dSage Techniques were simply too rare!In a day and age where Emperor Techniques were mostly extinct, Sage Techniques were the highest level one could attain. In the entire Firmament Star, one could only find less than a handful of them.\u201cWhat do you think of this technique, Master?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked.\u201cVery good! Fantastic!\u201dThe Sect Master could not help but breathe a little heavier.Chu Kuangren continued, \u201cThis is known as the Human Mountain Stamp. If the Dharma Sect opens all of its cultivation techniques to me, I shall give this technique in return.\u201dInstantly, the crowd looked at each other with suspicion.Indeed, all of the Dharma Sect\u2019s techniques were vital to them, but on the other hand, this was a never before seen Sage Technique.\u201cThis is no small matter. We must discuss this first,\u201d the Sect Master stated.\u201cOf course.\u201d Chu Kuangren retrieved his Daoist rhyme.\u2026While the Dharma Sect Master and company discussed their next course of action, Chu Kuangren brought Lan Yu around the area on a leisurely stroll as if they were on a sightseeing tour.\u201cYoung man, isn\u2019t it a loss to trade one Sage Technique for everything else?\u201d The Seventh Forefather\u2019s voice rang from the void.\u201cSage Techniques may be precious, but Dharma Sect\u2019s collection of techniques is vital for me to perfect my Dao techniques. It won\u2019t be a loss for me.\u201d\u201cBesides, even if I give it to them, they must gain insights for it. By the time someone masters the technique, I would be miles ahead of them.\u201dChu Kuangren grinned. His words were brimmed with confidence.Sage Techniques may be precious, but there were still quite a few in the Firmament Star. Moreover, those who have gained insights were also not rare, but how many had mastered it?Not everyone was Chu Kuangren.After half a day, the Dharma Sect Master came to Chu Kuangren, telling him that they had agreed to the deal but under one condition.\u201cThe Dharma Sect can open all our cultivation techniques to you, but you only have one day,\u201d the Sect Master stated.They had set the condition because they feared Chu Kuangren\u2019s terrifying ability to acquire techniques.The image of him acquiring all eight thousand methods in the stele forest was still vivid in their minds. If they gave him all of the Dharma Sect\u2019s Supreme and Sage Techniques, they would be defenseless against him in the future.Hence that was the reason for the time limit.Besides, Supreme Techniques were not methods. With only a day, even Chu Kuangren\u2019s insane ability would not be able to allow him to acquire all the techniques, right?\u201cSect Master, is this as far as your sincerity goes?\u201d the Seventh Forefather walked out of the void with a dissatisfied frown.Supreme Techniques were a thousand times harder to learn than methods. Even with Chu Kuangren\u2019s insane abilities, just how many could he acquire?This was how they wanted to trade a Sage Technique?\u201cIt is alright, Seventh Forefather.\u201d Chu Kuangren waved his hand with a casual smile. \u201cIn that case, a day it is.\u201dThe Sect Master\u2019s face fell a little upon seeing Chu Kuangren\u2019s confident smile. Had they underestimated his abilities?\u201cPlease come with me then.\u201dThe Sect Master had Chu Kuangren engrave the Human Mountain Stamp onto a Dao stele before he led him to their scripture library.The scripture library was where the Dharma Sect kept their heritage. As Chu Kuangren scanned the area, he realized that there were seventy-four Supreme Techniques and four Sage Techniques, including the Daoist Element of the Five Ways, and moreEight thousand methods in the stele forest could not compare to even a tenth of the techniques here!All these techniques were now before him, free for him to take.\u201cOne day is enough.\u201d Chu Kuangren smiled to himself.To other cultivators, even a genius could only attain about ten percent of a Supreme Technique in a day.However, this was no problem for Chu Kuangren.The Dharma Sect Master and company underestimated him.Chu Kuangren took out a gold card \u2014 the Golden Dao Enlightenment Card he had gotten from the Roulette Room two days ago.The last time he acquired it, he used it to create the Sage Technique Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique.This time, he would use it with his Meditational Clarity Trait.Once Chu Kuangren crushed the card, he entered a mysterious state of enlightenment while activating his Trait.\u2026Outside the scripture library, the Sect Master and the elders of the higher-ups were watching. It had been twenty hours since Chu Kuangren entered.Four hours remained in his one-day time limit.\u201cOnce the time limit is up, get him out of there immediately. His comprehensive ability is too scary, so don\u2019t leave him in there for an extra second,\u201d an elder said seriously.\u201cIndeed. If he gets hold of all of the Dharma Sect\u2019s techniques, we\u2019ll have no secrets left against him.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s an absolute taboo for cultivators.\u201d\u201cIt might seem unkind to do so, but the Dharma Sect\u2019s sage orthodoxy roots are at stake. So be it if we come across as shameless.\u201dWhile the elders were in mid-discussion, a terrifying Daoist Rhyme soared into the sky from the scripture library and swept in all directions.The whole Dharma Sect shook violently.The Daoist Rhyme that manifested in the void was a figure in a white robe that, if one looked closely, resembled Chu Kuangren.While the Dharma Sect Master and company were in shock, the figure raised the longsword in his hand and waved it at the void.In an instant, brilliant rays of light burst forth as strong winds swept across the skies, shook the ground, froze the rivers and lakes, and burned the lands with flames\u2026\u201cThat\u2019s the Four Mystical Arts! How can he alone pull off something that requires four people?\u201d\u201cWait, look there!\u201dHigh in the sky, the white-robed figure continued to swing his sword. A different Daoist Rhyme would appear every time he swung his sword, each representing a different technique.In the span of a few breaths, all seventy-four of the Supreme Techniques and the four Sage Techniques were showcased one by one.The sight of this agitated the Sect Master and company.\u201cH-how is this possible?!\u201d\u201cAll the techniques with one sword?!\u201d\u201cIt hasn\u2019t even been a day yet! How has he learned all the techniques in the scripture library?! My god, what kind of ability does he have?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

His proficiency with them could rival the Sect Master himself!All of this was beyond everyone\u2019s expectations.\u201cHow is his comprehensive ability so terrifying?!\u201d\u201cIs he even human?!\u201d\u201cSimply horrifying.\u201dThe Dharma Sect Master was dumbfounded.All it took was a day!They had all thought that it would be impressive if Chu Kuangren could acquire even ten Supreme Techniques.However, acquiring eight thousand methods from the stele forest in half a day was simply terrifying, and they thought he could only acquire roughly thirty of them.After all, Supreme Techniques were much more difficult than methods.Unfortunately, they had still underestimated him!It was a drastic underestimation!In the void, Chu Kuangren\u2019s figure swung the sword around to practice all the techniques before he stopped. He stood mid-air with the sword in hand and his eyes unmoving.Yet the majestic Daoist Rhymes around him increased rapidly, and many of those Rhymes gradually fused into one!It was a terrifying and boundless sword Daoist Rhyme!Chu Kuangren\u2019s figure began to move again.He moved the moment all of the Daoist Rhymes fused into one. He swung the sword, and a dazzling purple sword ray pierced through the heaven, tearing a large hole in between the clouds.\u201cWhat a terrifying Daoist Rhyme!\u201d\u201cDoes this mean he has mastered the Single Strike Technique?\u201dThe Sect Master and company looked at each other.At that moment, the figure in the sky disappeared and the strong Daoist rhyme receded like a tide, but the door to the scripture library opened with a creak.The white-robed Chu Kuangren slowly walked out, where the crowd could see the faint mysterious runes that surrounded him.\u201cHis Transcendent Coalescence Daoist Physique has improved.\u201d The Sect Master narrowed his eyes when he saw this, but he was shocked on the inside.He now had a reason to believe that it was highly likely for Chu Kuangren to have obtained a perfect Transcendent Coalescence Daoist Physique from the insights he had acquired.\u201cThis has been a bountiful visit. I greatly thank you, Master. I\u2019ve been quite the chatterbox these past two days, so I shall take my leave now.\u201d Chu Kuangren grinned.He was very satisfied with his visit to the Dharma Sect this time as his Single Strike Technique improved by leaps and bounds.Though his Heaven-Slaying Sword Drawing Technique improved even more. Compared to the White Lotus Light of Purification, this Avarice Technique was even stronger than a Sage Ruler Technique.The Dharma Sect Master and everyone else felt uncomfortable at Chu Kuangren\u2019s words.He had only been in the Dharma Sect for less than two days, yet he had already acquired all of their Techniques.Whereas the rest of the disciples had trained so hard for most of their lives but they still could not compare themselves to Chu Kuangren\u2019s effort in a single day. The gap was too big.\u201cJunior Chu, take care. I won\u2019t see you out.\u201dThe Sect Master smiled, but it was very forced. After all, he was hit just as hard as everyone.\u201cI will. May we meet again.\u201dChu Kuangren bowed slightly before he turned around with Lan Yu and walked down the mountain. Wherever he went, the disciples of the Dharma Sect would look at him with complicated gazes filled with anger, admiration, and hysteria.However, few were envious.The gap was impossible to close as it was no longer something that was achievable in this world. How could one feel envy over an impossible feat?\u201cA great world war? That\u2019s all a joke.\u201d\u201cIn a world full of fights, the stars still shine, but this man is more like the scorching sun. How can you see the stars when the sun outshines us all?\u201dIn the crowd, Yuanhong laughed bitterly. Beside him, Su Tianyi and others looked dejected and helpless.\u2026Since Chu Kuangren began his visit to each large sage orthodoxy, many people had started to keep an eye on his every move.It was inevitable; he attracted too much attention.He went to the Royal Azure Dynasty and became their Prince.He went to the School of White Lotus and became a Bachelor Sage.He went to the Taixu Temple and easily defeated their lord.Now the whole of the Azure Dragon Domain was guessing what kind of drama he would cause in the next sage orthodoxy.While some people were already numb to Chu Kuangren\u2019s continuous bouts of drama since the start. It was easy for them to just come to terms and move on with anything he did.However, when news of what happened in the Dharma Sect spread, these numb cultivators still had the shock of their life.Acquiring all eight thousand methods in the stele forest in half a day?!Are you saying a human did that?\u201cThe stele forest\u2019s eight thousand methods may not be much, but it\u2019s still eight thousand of them! Ten methods a day will still add up to several years!\u201d\u201cEight thousand methods in half a day? What kind of fairytale are you telling me?\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201dWhen the news first got out, everyone\u2019s first reaction was disbelief, but too many cultivators had witnessed the event firsthand that day. Hence many people confirmed it, and it soon became the truth.Even so, that was not the only news going around.Some people even said that Chu Kuangren had won the Dharma Sect Master in a spar.Others said that he spent less than a day mastering all of their Dao techniques.When the rumors were confirmed, everyone was shaken to the bone.What was the Dharma Sect known for?They had so many diverse Dao techniques that it made up ninety percent of the world\u2019s techniques.So many that even the past Sect Masters dare not proclaim that they had mastered them all. Yet somehow, Chu Kuangren had acquired them all in two days?How did one expect people to take the news, if not shocked?\u201cWhy didn\u2019t Chu Kuangren go to heaven?!\u201d\u201cF*ck this. How does someone like him exist? Is he the reincarnation of some God? If not, how is he so terrifying?!\u201d\u201cThe possibility is definitely there.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve spent years working hard to acquire only one Supreme Technique, and he gets eight thousand methods in half a day? Why do I even try?\u201d\u201cScary. So scary.\u201d\u201cMy goodness. He\u2019s a monster.\u201dThis sent the Azure Dragon Domain into a state of shock \u2014 the kind of shock that could be felt throughout the whole Firmament Star and heavens.Even though many people believed it, some were still skeptical.\u201cEight thousand methods in half a day? Only a Heavenly Emperor could do that, and Chu Kuangren is still far from it.\u201dThe newly appointed Daoist of Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom, Ao Chang, also had doubts.\u201cThe Dharma Sect is a sage orthodoxy, and you\u2019re telling me he acquired everything in two days? That\u2019s a horrible joke. Even if it were true, acquiring a technique doesn\u2019t mean he can use it. You\u2019ll just weigh yourself down by forcibly acquiring so many techniques.\u201dZhiyang Valley\u2019s Lin Batian spoke his mind behind Ao Chang.His words garnered plenty of support from other people.In terms of Dao techniques, more does not equal better. There are many aspects to balance, and learning too many just complicates things.Learning everything just leads to subpar performance in everything. Truly powerful cultivators only focus on a few Dao techniques.The Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom and Zhiyang Valley\u2019s Daoists spoke in turn, each expressing their doubts. Chu Kuangren\u2019s Black Heaven Sect would not just take that lying down.\u201cForcibly acquiring? Please. Why don\u2019t you go ahead and try to \u2018forcibly acquire\u2019 eight thousand methods? Don\u2019t say the grapes are sour just because you can\u2019t eat them. Some people really are laughable.\u201d Nangong Huang retorted.\u201cIndeed. Who is this new Daoist from the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom anyway? Criticizing my Bachelor Sage\u2026\u201dThe School of White Lotus chimed in supportively.\u201cAnyone that slanders my husband is an enemy of the Royal Azure Dynasty.\u201d Princess Linglong added.2What a marvelous sight it was to see three great sage orthodoxies unanimously support Chu Kuangren.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

No one wanted to argue with three great sage orthodoxies, not even the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom or Zhiyang Valley.Days after Chu Kuangren left the Dharma Sect, another piece of news shook the nation.The Honorable Orthodoxy, Mountain River Sect, in Northern Lingdao prefecture had been destroyed!Five thousand years ago, the Demon Vow Sect brought misfortune to the Azure Dragon Domain, and now they have risen once more!A few sage orthodoxies could not sit still upon hearing this.The Demon Vow Sect was an army created by the self-proclaimed Demon Vow Lord five thousand years ago. They had grown rapidly since their creation, but because they caused too much bloodshed, a few sage orthodoxies worked together and destroyed them.Now that they have risen once more, the resurfacing memories of bloodshed worried a lot of people.\u201cSigh, what the Demon Vow Sect did back then was horrifying. All of their members practiced demon magic. They had no morals and no consideration for the consequences of their actions. Who knows how many creatures they have poisoned into their bloody ways?\u201d\u201cIndeed. I can still feel the lingering fear as we speak.\u201d\u201cBut didn\u2019t they die? Most of the Sect\u2019s followers died in battle, so how did they revive?\u201d\u201cI heard that the Demonic Honorable came back to life.\u201d\u201cImpossible!\u201d\u201cReally! According to someone in Northern Lingdao, there was a young man who looked like the Demonic Honorable. He even used the Great Demon Vow Techniques from back in the day!\u201dWhile Gossip ran rampant in the Azure Dragon Domain, all the great sage orthodoxies made their moves by sending people to Northern Lingdao to gather information.Two days later, these sage orthodoxies announced an operation to destroy the demon cultivators. They would dispatch people into Northern Lingdao and wipe the demon cultivators out.In an instant, Northern Lingdao was bustling.Chu Kuangren had also gotten Honorable Xuan Qi\u2019s message, to hurry and join the demon hunt. With that, he accepted and headed towards Northern Lingdao.\u2026\u201cSeventh Forefather, was the Demon Vow Sect powerful back then?\u201dOn the Fairy boat, Chu Kuangren asked out of curiosity.He had read a few classical literatures with records of the Demon Vow Sect, and every line stated how horrifying they were.\u201cThey actually weren\u2019t that powerful.\u201dThe answer came as a surprise to Chu Kuangren.\u201cNot powerful? Then why did several sages have to join forces to deal with it? The books also said that the sage orthodoxies worked together and fought the Demon Vow Sect for three days and three nights, which injured and killed thousands.\u201d\u201cHeh.\u201d The Seventh Forefather chuckled.\u201cIn fact, the Demon Vow Sect is slightly weaker than the sage orthodoxies, but the only difference is that they made more noise about it. The sage orthodoxies did join forces, that is true, but it was just to boost their reputations.\u201d\u201cWhat? To boost their reputations?\u201d\u201cYes. The Demon Vow Sect was indeed cruel and bloody; they enraged the people and threw their lives into misery. So by stepping in to eliminate evil, the sage orthodoxies could not only win the hearts of the people, but it also boosted their reputation and kept their luck going. Why would they want to let such an opportunity slip by them?\u201d\u201cAs for the books\u2026 History is often written by winners. By depicting the demons as a force that\u2019s scarier than they actually are, the sage orthodoxies get to say that they are strong which will further boost their reputation.\u201dThe Seventh Forefather\u2019s words stunned Chu Kuangren.That sh*t worked?The sage orthodoxies used the Demon Vow Sect as a tool for their book, yet he thought they were powerful.\u201cSo what you\u2019re telling me is that the sage orthodoxies are using the Demon Hunt as another tactical ego boost?\u201d Chu Kuangren stated blandly.\u201cThat is true, but wanting to purge the demons is also true. They get to use this as training for their disciples,\u201d the Seventh Forefather responded.On the other end, Northern Lingdao was descending into chaos.Due to all the rumors that spread, the Demon Sect disciples that had escaped the last time came out, once again, to cause trouble with all the demonic cultivators.These cultivators were ruthlessly cruel. Sucking on human flesh and blood to cultivate their powers, catching people to feed their beasts, sacrificing human souls to enhance magical weapons\u2026 the list went on.There were some who even purely enjoyed killing and causing havoc.It was no exaggeration to say that Northern Lingdao was like hell on earth. The people\u2019s lives there were full of sorrow and they mattered less than grass in the wind.In a town not far off, cries rang throughout the skies where a few demon cultivators ordered their beasts around, wreaking havoc.\u201cRoar!\u201d One beast opened its bloody jaws and chomped down one of the people there. The person did not even have the time to scream before getting torn in half, guts spilling out in a pool of blood.Nearby, a child cried their heart out, but the demon cultivators grinned.\u201cHaha! Without the Mountain River Sect around, the whole of Northern Lingdao is ours to do as we please!\u201dOne of the demon cultivators sat on their beast and grinned.The Mountain River Sect was the sage orthodoxy that ruled over Northern Lingdao, but they were destroyed a few days ago.According to rumors, the Supreme Demonic Honorable had personally brought them over too and that would explain why the demon cultivators dared to act so boldly.\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t really care for the Demonic Honorable. But since he destroyed Mountain River Sect and gave us this playground, I\u2019m willing to call him my lord!\u201d another new cultivator said.Then, a few others nodded in agreement.\u201cListen to all those beautiful cries of agony. This is music to my ears! Cry, scream! You\u2019re worth nothing more than to serve as our entertainment!\u201dThe demon cultivator said in joy as he rode on his beast.Swoosh!Instantly, a sword ray swept through them from a distance before it locked onto the demon cultivator and his beast.The sword ray was so unbelievably sharp that it tore both the beast and its master to shreds.\u201cWho was that?!\u201d\u201cD*mn it, show yourself!\u201dThe remaining demon cultivators\u2019 faces fell. They then looked in the direction of the sword ray and saw a white-robed young man walking over from the end of the street.The slender young man wore an immaculate wide-sleeved white robe, and his aura made him seem like a god, but his face was as cold as ice.\u201cOh god, please save us!\u201d\u201cGod, please have mercy on us!\u201dThe people on the street fell to their knees and with hope in their eyes, they begged for the young man to help.However, the demon cultivators\u2019 eyes were filled with hate when they saw this. They ordered their beasts to attack the young man.\u201cGo to hell!\u201d\u201cTear him to pieces!\u201dThe beasts had a terrifying aura, and the ground shook with every step they took. Compared to the beasts, the young man looked as thin and insignificant as a twig.Despite that, the young man\u2019s face remained unchanged as he continued to walk toward the Demon Vow Sect disciples. Several purple sword rays then burst from his body and in one swift move, the beasts were beheaded.\u201cThis is bad! He must be a cultivator from the Nascent Soul Realm. Run!\u201d\u201cWe\u2019re no match for him!\u201dWithout saying anything more, the demon cultivators attempted to flee, but as soon as they took a step forward, their back legs were caught in the void.They were stuck.At that moment, their pupils shrank and their faces filled with horror. \u201cThis is the spatial force! He isn\u2019t from the Nascent Soul Realm, he\u2019s from the Paradise Realm!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They were all in a state of panic.Without uttering a single word, Chu Kuangren raised his hands and invoked an Avarice Technique.The demonic cultivators were instantly sucked into an Avarice dimension, endured the pain and tortured that pierced through their flesh and skins as their wails echoed throughout the space.Whoosh\u2026Flying in from afar, Lan Yu landed beside Chu Kuangren. Her body was still radiating an oppressive murderous aura. \u201cMaster, the remaining one has been dealt with.\u201d\u201cAlright, let\u2019s go.\u201dLan Yu nodded gently.\u201cThank you, our savior! Thank you!\u201dBehind them were the cheerings of countless citizens.Even so, Chu Kuangren did not look back. Ever since he stepped foot into Northern Lingdao, he had gotten used to such a scene long ago.After leaving the village, Chu Kuangren continued on his journey towards Northern Lingdao, where several sky rides from various sage orthodoxies were already gathering there.However, there was something that puzzled Chu Kuangren\u2026\u2026Throughout his journey, most of what he had witnessed were refugees scattering around while the demonic cultivators caused rampant chaos wherever they went.It was rare to see any sage orthodoxies mobilizing their cultivators to save the day.Did they not agree to an operation to eradicate these demonic cultivators?Did the sage orthodoxies not send anyone into battle?Where were they?Where did these people go?Chu Kuangren did not ask Seventh Forefather about the number of people the Black Heaven Sect had sent because deep down, he already had a good estimate of the answer.In a city within Northern Lingdao, a group of demonic cultivators was causing widespread chaos as they went on a murdering rampage and looted countless resources from the city.Refugees were running wildly on the streets.Some demonic cultivators had murdered an entire family just for a piece of soulstone, while some vented their primal lust on women, and some even tortured citizens to their death to retrieve their souls and enhance their demonic weapons\u2026What was once a city had quickly become hell.Meanwhile, Nangong Huang was leading a few cultivators to defend against the enemies.Upon the brandishing of a sacred sword, Daoist Rhymes filled the air as sword rays shot out like a thunderous waterfall, instantly slicing a demonic slayer into half.\u201cThis is not good. There\u2019s too many of them.\u201d Nangong Huang seemed troubled. They were clearly outnumbered by the demonic cultivators.\u201cThis is horrible. The other sage orthodoxies didn\u2019t even send reinforcements. How\u2019re we able to defeat them with just a few of us?\u201d Mu Rongxuan came up to Nangong Huang and said.\u201cDamn it. Even if there weren\u2019t any casualties from the Demon Vow Sect, it\u2019s impossible for them to send this many reinforcements. These cultivators are not only from the Demon Vow Sect, they must be from other demonic orthodoxies too!\u201d\u201cThe temptation is sure huge when it comes to a Supreme Demonic Honorable treasure.\u201dAt that very moment.A large cloud of sword Qi began to amass above the sky, forming twelve long sword Qi pillars which were surrounded by Daoist symbols and it locked the entire city within!\u201cWhat power is this?\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s this?!\u201dImmediately, every cultivator could feel a huge sense of oppressive energy and several demonic cultivators became even more frightened.Nan Gonghuang and Mu Rongxuan looked at each other with joy glimmering in their eyes.\u201cIt\u2019s the Nine Heaven Sword Prison. Our Elder Senior Brother is here!\u201d\u201cFinally, Elder Senior Brother has arrived.\u201dAmid the cloud, a figure dressed in white robes emerged as he screamed at the demonic slayers that had been stirring up troubles, \u201cDie!\u201dIn the blink of an eye, copious amounts of sword Qi flowed within the Nine Heaven Sword Prison before it precisely targeted the locations of the demonic cultivators, killing them off one by one!The demonic cultivators who had been indulging in their murderous lusts were now overwhelmed with the fear of death as they pleaded for their lives.\u201cNo, no!\u201d\u201cDamn it! What kind of a person is he?!\u201dBoom!A hunchback elder had broken free from the suppression of the Nine Heaven Sword Prison. As he channeled his spiritual energy, he dashed towards Chu Kuangren.\u201cNow, die for me!\u201dHe pushed his palm forward and it transformed into a terrifying black gigantic palm.It was a full-force attack from a peak Battle Monarch!At the end of a street, a black-haired brute man had broken free of the suppression of the\u00a0Nine Heaven Sword Prison by striking the air with a large sword.\u201cThis is a sword object transformation. If we don\u2019t kill this person, we\u2019ll never escape from here. Howling Ghost Technique! Charge!\u201d On the other end, a white-haired old woman let out a malicious laugh. Channeling her spiritual energy, a mass of black mist formed into the shape of a large skull that charged towards Chu Kuangren.At that moment, the strengths from three peak Battle Monarchies were locked onto Chu Kuangren!In the city, the demonic cultivators were elated.\u201cIt\u2019s Granny Ghost, Bloodsword, and the Yin Mountain Elder! They are all reputable cultivators amongst the demonic orthodoxies!\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s great! With their combined strengths, they could surely defeat that bastard.\u201d\u201cNot bad, we\u2019re finally saved.\u201d\u201cA puny brat like him isn\u2019t enough to stop us.\u201dAgainst the three demonic cultivators\u2019 incoming attacks, Chu Kuangren maintained the utmost calm composure in mid-air. It was until a sudden flow of mythical Daoist Rhymes danced around him before it slowly transformed into a garden of white lotuses.The white lotuses swirled around the air, feeding on the pure energy that radiated from Chu Kuangren.When the three incoming attacks came, it landed on the white lotuses, but upon their impacts, there were no earthshaking explosions. Instead, its violent energies were purified by the white lotuses \u2014 absorbed and disintegrated.Like the summer rain, their energies were cleansed.If an Honorable had a difficult time breaking through the defenses of the White Lotus Purification, what more for these demonic cultivators who were only at the Battle Monarch realms?\u201cImpossible!\u201d\u201cHow did he do that? What technique is that?\u201dThe three demonic cultivators were instantly shocked.\u201cThat\u2019s not good. Run!\u201d The black-haired brute immediately realized that he was no match for Chu Kuangren, so he went for an escape.However, since his physical body was still within the Nine Heaven Sword Prison, there was no way he could escape!Chu Kuangren raised his eyes and the Self Descendant Holy Sword materialized on his hand. With a wave of his hand, a stream of purple sword ray immediately erupted and flew straight towards the demonic cultivator.Fierce and swift, the sword ray was absolutely destructive!The black-haired brute turned around and attempted to block the attack with his sword, but with a clear slashing sound, the brute was instantly cut into half along with his sword.In a second, a peak Battle Monarch was murdered with the stroke of a sword!Such unprecedented combat power certainly frightened the rest of the demonic cultivators.Moreover, it had also riled up the excitements of the Black Heaven Sect\u2019s disciples.\u201cElder Senior Brother, you\u2019re awesome!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s been a while since I last saw him, but Elder Senior Brother certainly improved really quickly!\u201dThen came another two strokes of the sword.The Elder of Yin Mountain and Granny Ghost were also defeated with the same technique, and for the rest of the demonic cultivators, their fates had also been sealed.Within the confinement of the Nine Heaven Sword Prison, the demonic cultivators were slain one by one. Their wails and screams could be heard throughout as their demon blood dyed the floors of the main streets\u2026The residents observed the entire scene with no sympathy at all. All they felt at the moment was a deep-rooted hatred for the demonic cultivators. Deep down, they wished they could be the ones to kill off these cultivators who had harmed their families and friends\u2026A few moments later, the entire city was completely cleared off from demonic cultivators.\u201cElder Senior Brother.\u201d Nangong Huang walked towards Chu Kuangren and greeted him.\u201cWhy is it only a few of you? Where are the rest?\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re all at Mountain River City.\u201d\u201cThe demonic cultivators were rampaging throughout the city. Why didn\u2019t they come out? Didn\u2019t we decide to have an operation?\u201d Chu Kuangren asked coldly.Nangong Huang, Murong Xuan, and a few looked at each other as their eyes burned with anger. \u201cThey\u2019re busy enjoying themselves. Why would they care about this?\u201d\u201cWhat happened?\u201d\u201cThey thought that the situation was still under control at Northern Lingdao and they wouldn\u2019t gain as much credit if they acted immediately. So they wanted to wait until the situation blew up a little before they made their way here! What a bunch of bastards!\u201d Murong Xuan said angrily.Chu Kuangren was not surprised at all. He secretly sighed\u2026 So he was right.\u201cSeventh Forefather, when the Demon Vow Sect arrived a few thousand years ago, was it the same situation with these sage orthodoxies?\u201dThen, Chu Kuangren finally asked Seventh Forefather the question he had long kept within.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

They simply deemed it morally acceptable by justifying to themselves that they did not directly commit those sins.Upon hearing Chu Kuangren\u2019s question, Seventh Forefather was silent for a moment before he lamented, \u201cIt is indeed a fact that the sage orthodoxies do not lack irresponsible cultivators.\u201dChu Kuangren nodded. \u201cI understand now.\u201d\u2026The Mountain River City was once where the sage orthodoxy, Mountain River Sect, resided. However, following the demise of the sage orthodoxy, the location soon descended into utter chaos.It was until an alliance of sage orthodoxies occupied and managed this land that the situation improved.At this moment, a huge party was held in a restaurant where countless guests danced, feasted, and clinked glasses with one another.It was a huge contrast to the outside world, where many were left starving, their shelters destroyed, and their clothes torn after the onslaught of demonic cultivators.\u201cCome, allow me, Host Lee, to finish this drink for all the sky-prides who are here with us today. All of you are kind people for being so willing to come out and save the day.\u201dAt the party, a middle-aged man in a Chinese robe was smiling away. Standing before him were the sky-prides from Zhiyang Valley, Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom, Five Way Sect, and many others.\u201cHost Lee, your compliment is too generous. Eradicating demonic cultivators are our duties,\u201d Fangtian from the Five Ways Sect said heroically. If one did know better, one would have assumed this individual had slain countless demonic cultivators and saved many lives.\u201cDaoist Fang, what you said does make sense.\u201dHost Lee smiled and nodded. Then, he hesitated for a moment before he said, \u201cThis demonic onslaught has been going on for seven days now. I was wondering are you guys planning to make a move? If this continues, I\u2019m afraid Northern Lingdao will soon fall.\u201dAlthough he posed this question, Host Lee was actually furious.The group of sky-prides had been in Mountain River City for a few days now, yet they still had not attended to the situation. Instead, they were busy indulging themselves in many pleasures too.\u201cGive it a few more days. Not only are there members from Demon Vow Sect, but there are many from other demonic orthodoxies too. I\u2019ll wait for all of them to come and slay them all at once!\u201dGu Changge said calmly as he sipped his beer.\u201cExactly. The reason why these demonic cultivators are mushrooming out of nowhere is that they\u2019re searching for a Sage Ruler Weapon that belonged to a Supreme Demonic Honorable. Even if we act after they found it, it still won\u2019t be too late,\u201d Lin Batian said.Their investigations from the past few days had found their conclusion. The Supreme Demonic Honorable had never come to live at all. Instead, the party responsible for destroying the Mountain River Sect was a youngster that resembled the Supreme Demonic Honorable and a mysterious elder.The duo\u2019s goal was to acquire the Sage Ruler Weapon which the Supreme Demonic Honorable had yielded to rule over the world. Soon, news of the duo spread across various demonic orthodoxies and demonic cultivators from all over the Azure Dragon Domain soon flocked towards Northern Lingdao.\u201cTsk, the Sage Ruler Weapon, the Demonic spear of Apocalypse, was the reason why the Supreme Demonic Honorable was able to dominate over sages and ruled his territories. However, after the death of the Supreme Demonic Honourable, the spear had gone missing. No one would\u2019ve thought that it was hidden within Northern Lingdao all along,\u201d the White Lotus Bachelor Sage said as his eyes reflected his burning desire.After all, it was a Sage Ruler Weapon.A Sage weapon was already alluring enough to grab the attention of countless cultivators, what more for an even sophisticated weapon like a Sage Ruler Weapon.Amongst the loud chatter of the sky-prides, all of the discussions centered around the strength of the Sage Ruler Weapon, but none talked about entering the battle. Host Lee was feeling more nervous as time passed.\u201cLet me in!\u201d At that moment, a youngster rushed in and stared furiously at all the sky-prides in the banquet.\u201cThe Daoist of the Mountain River Sect? Oh, what\u2019s the matter?\u201d Gu Changge stared coldly at the person and said.The youngster was one of the only remaining survivors from the Mountain River Sect. He glanced across the delicacies that were served on the table and asked angrily, \u201cWhen exactly are you all going to join the fight?\u201d\u201cMy fellow Daoist, do not panic. We will act when the time necessitates.\u201d\u201cWhen\u2019s that? When Northern Lingdao\u2019s residents are almost wiped out?\u201d The Mountain River Sect\u2019s Daoist asked.\u201cNonsense! Don\u2019t forget that the only reason why Northern Lingdao would descend into such chaos was that the Mountain River Sect is useless in defending it. We\u2019re kind enough to come and clear up your mess. What\u2019s that attitude all about?\u201dA Daoist from the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom retorted.At this, the Mountain River Daoist was even more furious. \u201cWhile it may be true that the Mountain River Sect has failed to prevent the demonic onslaught from happening, your organizations don\u2019t deserve to be called a sage orthodoxy if you just sit here and watch as the demons take countless lives!\u201d\u201cHilarious. We could\u2019ve completely disregarded this incident and let the entire Northern Lingdao be reduced to smithereens. However, now that we\u2019re here, not only did you not show your gratitude, but you dare question us? Preposterous!\u201d\u201cThe ones who are being preposterous are all of you! For the past few days, the Mountain River City has hosted you generously. The Lee Family, Wang Family, and Zhang Family have all exhausted their wealth just to plead for your help. Alas, what did any of you achieve?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve taken advantage of their services but failed to perform your basic duty. You\u2019re no more than a thief who roams the streets! Demon slaying operation? It\u2019s all just a huge joke!\u201dThe Mountain River Daoist was grinding his teeth as he stared resentfully at the sky-prides before him.\u201cMountain River Daoist, please read the situation. The more you offend us, the more unwilling we\u2019re only going to be. By then, the casualties of the Northern Lingdao would only increase. Your words now carry the weight of millions of lives within the city, are you sure you want to speak any further?\u201dGu Changge said calmly.\u201cYou\u2019re threatening me!\u201d The Mountain River Daoist\u2019s face became solemn.\u201cSo what if I am?\u201dAt that point, the sky-prides present were also sick of pretending to be so gentlemanly, so they looked at the Mountain River Daoist with mischievous intent.Clap clap clap\u2026Then, a clapping sound could be heard.A youngster dressed in a white robe was slowly walking into the private room.A few of the sky-prides immediately stood up in a panic when they saw the person.\u201cChu Kuangren!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s Chu Kuangren, he\u2019s here!\u201dChu Kuangren walked into the private room, took a sweeping glance across the venue, and said, \u201cWhat a happening occasion to be having a party here. The dishes don\u2019t look half bad at all. They\u2019re definitely way better than what the beggars at the corridors were chewing on.\u201d\u201cThese beggars were starving and didn\u2019t even have proper clothes to put on, unlike all of you, who\u2019re covered in glorious silk clothes. Ugh, when dogs put on clothes like these, they do resemble humans after all.\u201dThen, the expression on Gu Changge and company changed. Of course, they had picked up on Chu Kuangren\u2019s subtle reference of them as a pack of dogs.\u201cChu Kuangren, you watch your mouth!\u201dOne of the sky-prides snorted.Chu Kuangren did not even turn to look at that person at all. Instead, he slammed his palm midair and sent a surge of spiritual energy directly towards the sky-pride.With a smack, the sky-pride immediately jolted backward and landed on a table before the boiling pots of soup spilled onto his body and the sky-pride let out a pitiful cry.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",

Do you expect me to plan ahead for that?\u201dChu Kuangren said calmly. What followed his words was another slap, which sent the person flying out of the restaurant this time.The Mountain River Daoist and Host Lee witnessed the event in fear. After all, the victim was still a Daoist from a sage orthodoxy. How could Chu Kuangren react so rashly?However, they had to admit that it was satisfying to see that person get what he deserved.\u201cChu Kuangren, what\u2019re you trying to do?!\u201dGu Changge asked coldly.\u201cNothing much. I\u2019m just here to inform all of you that from today onwards, I\u2019ll be in charge of managing the Mountain River City.\u201d\u201cUnder whose order?! Are you expecting us to comply just because you said so?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve told you, I\u2019m just here to inform all of you. I\u2019m not seeking your approvals,\u201d Chu Kuangren replied calmly.1\u201cHmph, Chu Kuangren, do you think just because you\u2019re strong, you can do anything you want? Without us, how\u2019re you going to manage the Mountain River City?\u201dGu Changge sneered.Then, the communication compass in Gu Changge\u2019s Yin and Yang Ring suddenly vibrated.Once Gu Changge retrieved it, a communication message was heard.\u201cAll cultivators who were sent to Northern Lingdao, you\u2019re ordered to listen to Chu Kuangren\u2019s instructions!\u201d It was the firm voice of the Royal Azure Dynasty\u2019s Ruler.Gu Changge immediately lost his usual composure. Though he was not the only one as the White Lotus Bachelor Sage, who was sitting beside him, had received a similar message too.\u201cAs the Royal Princess\u2019s fiance of the Royal Azure Dynasty, and the Bachelor of the School of White Lotus, I\u2019ll also be in charge of the people you both brought along.\u201dChu Kuangren took a quick look at the duo and left the scene.\u201cChu Kuangren!\u201dGu Changge ground his teeth as he stared furiously at Chu Kuangren\u2019s silhouette.Meanwhile, Host Lee took in all that had just unfolded before he made a wise choice to leave Gu Changge and chase after Chu Kuangren.\u2026On the streets.Host Lee had finally caught up with Chu Kuangren. \u201cBrother Chu, I\u2019m the head of the Lee Family in Mountain River City. If I may ask, I was wondering when will you send your people into battle?\u201d\u201cThe cultivators of Black Heaven Sect, School of White Lotus, and the Royal Azure Dynasty are already battling the demonic cultivators as we speak.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s quick!\u201d Host Lee was elated.Finally, a reliable sky-pride.Host Lee had heard many stories about Chu Kuangren, so he knew that if Chu Kuangren was willing, he would definitely be of greater help than Gu Changge and his group.\u201cThe Lee Family offers its service to you!\u201dHost Lee immediately pledged his loyalty to Chu Kuangren.In this world, most cultivators essentially viewed commoners like them as disposable. However, there were a minority of cultivators who had risen to where they were from a commoner and hence viewed other commoners as equals.The Lee Family was such a family of cultivators.\u201cBrother Chu, you\u2019re kindhearted and so much more respectable than the so-called sky-prides who were partying away,\u201d The Mountain River Daoist said as he caught up.\u201cI\u2019m just doing my part.\u201dTo Chu Kuangren, the life of a commoner was a life too!Like commoners, cultivators were also humans!Chu Kuangren had long decided that he did not want to be a cultivator who merely treated the lives of other commoners as insignificant. So naturally, he would not sit and do nothing about the demonic onslaught.\u201cWhen I arrived at Northern Lingdao, I caught wind that these demonic cultivators were looking for a Sage Ruler Weapon. Can you tell me more about it?\u201dChu Kuangren suddenly recalled the topic and asked.\u201cOf course.\u201dThe Mountain River Daoist and Host Lee then explained the countless details behind the legendary weapon. Hints of anger could especially be seen in the eyes of the Mountain River Daoist as he narrated the stories.\u201cIt was said that the Sage Ruler Weapon, the Demonic Spear of Apocalypse, appeared in Northern Lingdao two thousand years ago ever since the demise of the Supreme Demonic Honorable but it was since sealed by the founding forefather of the Mountain River Sect!\u201d\u201cAnd it\u2019s also because of it that the Mountain River Sect has met its eventual demise!\u201dThe Mountain River Daoist clenched his fist and said.\u201cDo you know where this spear is?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t. As it was sealed by our founding forefather, no one else knows about the location apart from him and he has also long departed from this world.\u201d\u201cIn other words, no one in this world now knows where the spear is?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s correct.\u201dChu Kuangren nodded as he heavily contemplated an issue.\u2026On the second day, Chu Kuangren officially took over the Mountain River City. His first order was to have the Lee Family and other family sects to open up the city for other refugees to seek shelter in.Within a short period of time, many refugee camps were set up within the Mountain River City.This move had caused much dissatisfaction amongst the cultivators as they now had to put up with the sight of smelly, poorly-dressed refugees whenever they walked around the streets. Having been so spoiled and privileged for most of their lives, how could they put up with such a situation?Boom!A terrifying aura descended upon the porch near Chu Kuangren\u2019s residence.The sky-prides from Five Ways Sect, Zhiyang Valley, Taixu Temple, the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom, and many others had come for Chu Kuangren.\u201cChu Kuangren, show yourself!\u201dFangtian from the Five Ways Sect yelled.Upon the opening of the front door, a blast of white light, accompanied by a concentration of Daoist Rhymes, erupted from within before they could see anyone.Alert, Fangtian immediately mobilized the Daoist Elements of the Five Ways and blasted streams of colorful spiritual energy towards the oncoming attack before the energies intersected. Subsequently, Fangtian was sent a few steps back and his face paled.Lan Yu\u2019s figure emerged from within the residence. She stared coldly at everyone and said, \u201cYou\u2019re all making too much noise.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s so early in the morning and you\u2019re already barking like a mad dog. Could you let us rest a little?\u201d Chu Kuangren had also made his appearance at this point.\u201cChu Kuangren, the refugees are practically flooding the entire city, how do you expect us to go about our activities? Explain yourself!\u201dFangtian snorted coldly.\u201cActivities? Are you referring to your activities of hosting a huge banquet in restaurants, or is it satisfying your sexual lusts in brothels?\u201d Chu Kuangren snarked as he looked at all the cultivators before him.\u201cWhatever it is, it\u2019s too much of you to let so many refugees in. There\u2019s a huge empty space outside the city, why don\u2019t you let them live there?\u201d Yuanhong suggested.\u201cHeh, outside? Looks like you\u2019re all spoiled by all the privileges you have. Have you seen the situation outside? Demonic cultivators running amok rampantly and beasts roaming the streets freely. If we let these people out, how is it different than sending them to their deaths?\u201d Chu Kuangren said coldly.\u201cSo what? Only a few lives would\u2019ve been lost. When the time comes, we\u2019ll keep this demonic onslaught under control in no time.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right, Chu Kuangren. You must get rid of these refugees today. Otherwise, we will not help you with this demonic onslaught!\u201d\u201cExactly. Do you think you alone can keep this entire thing under control?\u201dThe group of sky-prides backed one another.Listening to these words, Chu Kuangren only felt it preposterous.Did these cultivators really come to slay demons?\u201cEven without all of you, I can slay the demons by myself!\u201dChu Kuangren said firmly.With a wave of his sleeves, a violent burst of sword Qi exploded, sending a group of cultivators flying several feet outside the compound.\u201cNow all of you, get lost!\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren, I can\u2019t believe you actually see yourself as undefeatable! We must teach you a lesson today!\u201d At that moment, some of the cultivators began to attack.They had heard stories about Chu Kuangren before but had never witnessed his abilities themselves. They thought that now would be a good opportunity to test the water.\u201cNot good!\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t do it!\u201d Yuanhong, Fangtian, and several other cultivators who had witnessed Chu Kuangren\u2019s abilities attempted to stop the rest from acting rashly.Although they had come to quarrel with Chu Kuangren, they had never planned on fighting him. After all, Chu Kuangren\u2019s power was something that none of them could easily forget.However, they were one step too late in preventing a disaster from happening.The sky-prides were already dashing towards Chu Kuangren and as their Daoist Rhymes circulated, their spiritual energies erupted.Yet, all Chu Kuangren had to do was lift his eyes and immediately, his attackers were suspended in midair with their techniques disabled.Following that, several clouds of blood mists instantly exploded in the same spot!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99: Lin Batian\u2019s Sacred Flames, A Sky-Pride From Thirty Thousand Years Ago\u201cDoes anyone still have objections?\u201dChu Kuangren said coldly.After Chu Kuangren massacred the attacking cultivators, the entire scene went dead silent.At that moment, a disruption could be felt between the dimensions as a few peak Battle Monarchies stared intently at Chu Kuangren.\u201cDon\u2019t you think you\u2019re too cruel and bloodthirsty? You killed others without uttering a single word, what difference does that make between you and a demonic cultivator?\u201d\u201cChu Kuangren, you\u2019re too much!\u201dThese Battle Monarchies were the Daoist Protectors of those sky-prides.As the Daoist Protectors were all cultivators of Battle Monarch realms, it implied that the highest levels of reinforcement these sky-prides could access were the Honorable cultivators.Chu Kuangren snarked. \u201cCruel? Let\u2019s make it clear, it was they who made the first move and it was without any reservation. Do you expect me to just sit by?\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re unhappy with it, you\u2019re also welcomed to try.\u201dChu Kuangren was fearless in the face of these Battle Monarchies. Throughout his journey, many Battle Monarchies had fallen under his blade after all.Although the expressions of the Battle Monarchies\u2019 faces looked even more intense now, none dared to attack Chu Kuangren.It was not Chu Kuangren they feared but the Daoist Protectors, that protected Chu Kuangren, were the ones whom they definitely could not defeat!Daoist Protectors typically would not interfere in the affairs of the younger generations. However, as Daoist Protectors, if they made a move on Chu Kuangren, his Daoist Protectors would definitely not stand by and watch.In fact, these Protectors were thinking ahead of themselves.Even if they were to attack, Seventh Forefather and the rest would not retaliate either.Chu Kuangren\u2019s Daoist Protectors knew just how capable his ability was. If Chu Kuangren could defeat an Honorable, what more of just a few Battle Monarchies?At last, the Daoist Protectors did not make a move at all.\u201cChu Kuangren, you\u2019re still your usual arrogant self.\u201d At that moment, Lin Batian from Zhiyang Valley finally spoke with his expression a little cold.Chu Kuangren took a quick peep at Lin Batian. Upon noticing his hair had now been dyed purple, Chu Kuangren asked in shock, \u201cYo, where did you dye your hair?\u201d\u201cHmph!\u201dLin Batian grunted. His body was now radiating a terrifying wave of Daoist Rhymes which shocked the sky-prides at the scene.Fangtian, Gu Changge, and others looked at Lin Batian incredulously.\u201cHow did his Daoist Rhyme change so dramatically?!\u201d\u201cSuch a powerful aura, but what\u2019s going on? How did he become so terrifying in such a short amount of time?\u201d\u201cSuch Daoist Rhymes might even be more powerful than an Honourable!\u201dChu Kuangren laughed lightheartedly. \u201cLooks like you\u2019ve managed to pick up on some decent techniques since we last met a few days ago. No wonder you now have the confidence to face me.\u201dThe Daoist symbols within his eyes began to spin as he activated the Remarkable Eye of Revelation.\u201cLin Batian, Daoist of the Zhiyang Valley.\u201d\u201cMastered the Sacred Flame left by the founding forefather of Zhiyang Valley\u2026\u201dSacred Flame?Was it a technique passed down by a sage?Chu Kuangren laughed. \u201cCome, let me witness how powerful your Sacred Flame is. Let\u2019s see if it can leave a scratch on me!\u201dLin Batian frowned, not knowing how Chu Kuangren had managed to find out about the Sacred Flame. However, he was already dying to fight Chu Kuangren at that point.Soon, seven scorching flames of differing colors began to manifest on his body, with each flame carrying enough power to boil an entire sea.\u201cChu Kuangren, I\u2019ve endured the pain of a thousand fire, went through hell and back to finally earn the seven-colored Sacred Flames. Today, I shall let you taste its power!\u201dLin Batian roared, and like shooting stars, the seven balls of flames were hurled towards Chu Kuangren. Wherever the ball of flames passed through, it curved the space and dimension around it.Everyone could feel the devastation that the Sacred Flame would bring and so, they retreated hastily, in fear that they would be caught in the crossfire.The Sacred Flame was a technique left behind by a sage, so it contained the Daoist Rhymes its predecessor. Even if Lin Batian did not have enough cultivation base to fully channel the technique, his current attack was enough to rival that of an Honourable!Chu Kuangren lightly lifted his hands and a magnificent amount of power was instantly activated. The mythical Daoist Rhymes danced in the air as it transformed into a garden of white lotuses.The white lotuses were elegant and delicate, and although they looked fragile from the outside, the Sacred Flames were incapable of getting past these flowers. In a blink of an eye, the Sacred Flames were soon extinguished into nothingness.That phenomenon shocked many sky-prides.\u201cWhat technique is that? It\u2019s capable of disintegrating his spiritual power.\u201d\u201cHow did he do that?!\u201d\u201cIt could even absorb the power of the Sacred Flames!\u201dThe crowds were dumbfounded.Amidst the crowd, the White Lotus Bachelor Sage gasped and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the School of White Lotus\u2019s Supreme Sage Ruler Technique\u2026 The White Lotus Light of Purification!\u201dThe crowd was even more shocked.Since when did Chu Kuangren acquire the School of White Lotus\u2019s Sage Ruler Technique?Why did none of the students in the School of White Lotus ever use this technique?Was this why Chu Kuangren had become a Bachelor Sage at their school?The White Lotus Bachelor Sage did not say much, but as he saw the white lotuses dancing around Chu Kuangren, he felt a deep-rooted instinct to bow down to Chu Kuangren.It was a White Lotus disciple\u2019s natural reaction towards the White Lotus Light of Purification!As much as the Bachelor Sage disliked Chu Kuangren, he could not resist the instinct.\u201cHmph, let\u2019s see how long you can take it!\u201d Lin Batian grunted and continued to attack Chu Kuangren by invoking his Sacred Flames.No matter how he attacked, as long as the Sacred Flames reached within a hundred feet radius of Chu Kuangren, it would evaporate into nothingness. Chu Kuangren was left completely untouched and as time passed, Lin Batian began to panic.How could it be?!The Sacred Flames which Lin Batian had gone through hell to acquire did nothing to hurt Chu Kuangren!Chu Kuangren\u2019s strength was beyond what Lin Batian could even imagine!\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe that you\u2019re actually infallible!\u201d In a fit of rage, Lin Batian channeled all of his spiritual energy into the Sacred Flames.Wild and destructive waves of Daoist Rhymes were immediately formed!\u201cSage Technique, Heavenly Blaze of Destruction!\u201d Lin Batian merged the surrounding Sacred Flames into one before he blasted it towards Chu Kuangren.Finally, the attack was enough to trespass the hundred feet radius of Chu Kuangren!A hundred feet, ninety feet\u2026However, the moment it crossed near-ninety feet of Chu Kuangren, the Sacred Flame was still extinguished.Everyone, including Lin Batian himself, was stunned.Despite channeling the entirety of his energy reserve, Lin Batian had managed to only advance ten feet. Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren had yet moved a single inch from his spot!The gap in their abilities was so significant!Lin Batian\u2019s Daoist spirit trembled and his face soured as he stared at Chu Kuangren. At that point, he felt as if a mountain had been loaded on top of his chest as he gasped desperately for air.He had thought that the Sacred Flame was enough to close the gap between him and Chu Kuangren. In fact, he had high hopes that it was enough for him to match Chu Kuangren\u2019s abilities.Alas, how did things turn out?Chu Kuangren had utterly defeated him without having to move a single inch!The gap in their abilities was enough to drive him to the brink of hopelessness!However, Lin Batian was not the only one who was overwhelmed with a sense of hopelessness. The other sky-prides felt the same too.\u201cNow it\u2019s my turn.\u201d Chu Kuangren looked at Lin Batian and lifted his hand, sending a single ray of sword Qi towards him.The purple sword ray charged violently towards Lin Batian, and despite him using his remaining strength to block the incoming attack, the impact still hurled him hundreds of feet away. The dispersed sword Qi even left dozens of deep wounds on Lin Batian\u2019s body.Lin Batian, defeated under a single strike!Everyone was completely silent at that point.Lin Batian had given it his all, but he still could not land a single scratch on Chu Kuangren who, with a lift of a hand, had dealt heavy damages on his opponent.Lin Batian had completely lost in both offensive and defensive abilities!It was unexplainable!\u201cChu Kuangren, you\u2019re indeed very strong.\u201d At that moment, a light flashed across the crowd before it was in front of them.That person was dressed in black clothes and he was radiating a mighty aura.\u201cIt\u2019s Ao Chang, the newly appointed Daoist of the Sacred Lands of Serene Wisdom!\u201dSomeone in the crowd recognized that person.Through the Remarkable Eyes of Revelation, even Chu Kuangren was a little surprised. \u201cA sky-pride from thirty thousand years ago?!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 100": "Chapter 100: The Ancient Sky-Pride Could Not Defend Against A Single Blow, Searching Throughout The Mountain River SectChu Kuangren had heard about these ancient sky-prides before.According to the legends, the past hundred and fifteen thousand years had been the era where the road to the Emperor\u2019s Realm was sealed and Dharma had ended!Unable to ascend into the Emperor\u2019s Realm, countless sky-prides had chosen to lock themselves into a hibernation mode, waiting for the Era of Great Battles to arrive.Evidently, Ao Chang was one of these ancient sky-prides.\u201cInteresting.\u201d Chu Kuangren\u2019s interest was finally aroused. How much more powerful would an ancient sky-pride be as compared to the ones today?Through the Eye of Revelation, Chu Kuangren found out that Ao Chang\u2019s combat abilities were significantly stronger than a Young Emperor like Lei Ao. Ao Chang could even use three different Sage Ruler Techniques, which was quite impressive!\u201cChu Kuangren, I\u2019ve been looking forward to challenging you for a while now.\u201d Ao Chang became unhappy when he had an unexplainable feeling that Chu Kuangren was staring through him. So, he began to channel the spiritual energies in his body and a mighty flow of Daoist Rhymes clouded the air.As Ao Chang slowly raised his hand, the space around him shook. Similar to an enormous rock falling into a lake, the ripples that Ao Chang created were both chilling and devastating.\u201cA Young Emperor! This is definitely a sky-pride who\u2019s at the level of a Young Emperor!\u201d\u201cNot only that, he\u2019s probably even more powerful than the average Young Emperor.\u201d\u201cDamn it, there used to be only eight Young Emperors in this realm. Why is it that so many Young Emperors have been making their appearances recently?\u201d\u201cThe Era of Great Battles is indeed here now!\u201dFacing Ao Chang\u2019s wrath, Chu Kuangren still maintained his calm composure. He even gestured and provoked his opponent to make the first move.\u201cHmph.\u201d At the provocation, Ao Chang could no longer hold it in. Upon the destructive blast of his Daoist Rhymes, he channeled his spiritual energies into a fist and threw a punch towards Chu Kuangren.The devastating spiritual energies and Daoist Rhymes then transformed into a terrifying image of the Sun. It was magnificent!\u201cSage Ruler Technique, Sunfall!\u201dA deafening explosion erupted in the air!When the Sunfall fist technique landed on the white lotuses, its terrifying spiritual energies fell directly onto the garden, but the white lotuses kept breaking it down. As the two different sources of Daoist Rhymes intersected, it created an incredible spectacle for all to witness.However, similar to Lin Batian\u2019s Sacred Flames, Ao Chang\u2019s fist attack was only capable of breaching ten feet of Chu Kuangren\u2019s barrier before it dissolved into nothingness.Chu Kuangren was still standing in his initial spot, calm and composed.\u201cLooks like there\u2019s nothing impressive about ancient sky-prides either.\u201dChu Kuangren shook his head and said with disappointment.\u201cThe white lotuses actually possess such remarkable defensive ability!\u201d Ao Chang was surprised before his gaze darkened again at the gravity of the situationHe had thought that in this era, no sky-pride was worth taking seriously; not even those who had ascended into becoming a Young Emperor.However, Chu Kuangren was different!He was definitely a worthy enemy!Ao Chang contemplated for a moment before he smiled and said, \u201cChu Kuangren, since you\u2019re aware that I\u2019m an ancient sky-pride, you should be clear that the Era of Great Battle is here not for people like you! It\u2019s for people like us!\u201d\u201cThe sky-prides of your time are too weak! When the ancient sky-prides awake from their slumber, that would mark the true beginning of the era. By then, Chu Kuangren, we shall have a rematch!\u201dAo Chang\u2019s words brought massive disturbance amongst the sky-prides who were present at the scene.It was the Era of Great Battles!Although they were lucky enough to be born into this generation, the era was not meant for them. What disappointing news to take in!When Ao Chang finished, he turned around and was prepared to leave.Only then did Chu Kuangren finally break his silence. \u201cHold on.\u201d\u201cOh, do you want to fight me again?\u201d\u201cYou\u2019ve given me a taste of your fist technique, I think it would be rude of me if I don\u2019t return the favor. I must let you have a taste of my sword too!\u201dChu Kuangren smiled. With the Descendent Self Holy Sword in his hand, he abruptly waved his sword and with a single slash, a bright purple sword ray burst out vigorously!Deadly and destructive, the sword technique looked like it could annihilate everything in its path!\u201cNot good! Sage Ruler Technique, Shield of the Mountain God!\u201d Caught off guard, Ao Chang immediately channeled his spiritual energies and Daoist Rhymes into forming a majestic mountain!The heavenly mountain possessed defensive abilities that very few could overcome!However, as the sword technique landed on the mountain, a massive disruption occurred between the realms, sending an unending wave of explosive energies into all directions. Many cultivators were swept out of the compound by the impact.Then, an ear-shattering explosion was heard!The heavenly mountain was shattered into pieces and its Daoist Rhymes disintegrated!The powerful purple sword ray landed directly on Ao Chang\u2019s body before it sent him backward, and like a blood rain, a mouthful of fresh blood spit out of his mouth!\u201cYou can\u2019t even defend against a single attack from me. Are you even fit to challenge me?\u201d\u201cFurthermore, let me remind you that I belong to this era. Ancient sky-prides like you are better off with continuing your slumber. Should any of you decide to come out and cause trouble, I\u2019ll make you understand what it feels to be hopeless!\u201dChu Kuangren stared at Ao Chang and enunciated every single word.Anyone in Chu Kuangren\u2019s position would not resist the temptation to trash-talk his opponent.\u201cYou\u2026\u201d Ao Chang was so furious that he wanted to refute.\u201cWhat now? Get lost!\u201dChu Kuangren\u2019s sword Qi flowed at the tip of his blade as the sword Daoist Rhymes radiated once again. No one at the scene dared to get close to Chu Kuangren at that moment.Having sustained heavy injuries, Ao Chang knew that he was no match for Chu Kuangren, so he left the scene immediately.\u2018Just wait and see, Chu Kuangren!\u2019\u2018Once I\u2019ve recovered my prime, you\u2019ll learn where you stand!\u201dAo Chang furiously cursed in his head and his face darkened.After Ao Chang left, the remaining sky-prides gradually left the residence too. They had absolutely no way of achieving what they came for.\u2026\u201cDamn it, Chu Kuangren is too strong. We have no way to retaliate at all.\u201dA sky-pride said unhappily.\u201cAre we really going to live with these filthy beggars?\u201d Another cultivator looked begrudgingly at the refugees below and said.\u201cNo way, I can\u2019t take it.\u201d\u201cWhy don\u2019t we refuse to lend our hands and let Chu Kuangren handle those demonic cultivators himself? I\u2019d like to see how he\u2019ll defend an entire state from them.\u201d\u201cSounds like a good idea. It doesn\u2019t matter how strong he is. He\u2019ll simply be outnumbered by the sheer amount of demonic cultivators there are. By then, he\u2019ll have no choice but to beg us for help.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right\u2026\u201dSeveral sky-prides had made the decision to withdraw their help, to use it as an opportunity to leverage on Chu Kuangren.Meanwhile, Chu Kuangren had just arrived at a piece of wasteland.More specifically, it was where the Mountain River Sect once was. Upon the defeat of the Mountain River Sect, the sage orthodoxy\u2019s location was completely ransacked and looted by the demonic cultivators within a day.By the time Chu Kuangren arrived, not a single soulstone had been found. What was left were broken structures and the remnants of what was once a glorious sect.\u201cMaster, why are we here?\u201dLan Yu asked curiously.\u201cLan Yu, if you were to seal a Sage Ruler demonic weapon, where would you choose to do it?\u201d\u201cOf course, it would be a place where I feel most secured.\u201d\u201cWhat place would make you feel most secured?\u201d\u201cA place where only I know.\u201d Lan Yu scratched her head and said everything that came to her mind.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Chu Kuangren nodded.\u201cMaster, are you implying that the founding forefather of the Mountain River Sect has sealed the weapon within his sage orthodoxy? This place looks like it has been turned upside down,\u201d Lan Yu said.\u201cMaybe there are some places that others have yet discovered.\u201dWith a smile, Chu Kuangren activated his Treasure Locating Skill.The acute observational abilities of Treasure Locating Skill soon came into action as Chu Kuangren scanned the entire Mountain River Sect again and again before finally, Chu Kuangren found something.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
