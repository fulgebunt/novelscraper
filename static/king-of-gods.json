Just as the sky lit up, while the whole of Sun Feather City was still hidden in the darkness before dawn\u2026\u2026Sun Feather City, Zhao Family Clan\u201cFlash!\u201dA young juvenile reacted on instinct, threw off his warm, comfortable covers, jumped up from his bed and put his clothes on. All of this was done in one breath.At this time most of the family sect disciples and even some of the servants, still slept\u2026\u2026This young person was around 13 to 14 years of age, with a slim body and a childish face. He wasn\u2019t super handsome, but he was still good-looking.Especially his eyes, they were clear and full of fighting will.\u201cJust a bit longer and I can reach the 2nd rank of the Martial Path, then I\u2019ll have all those other Zhao family sect disciples shut up.\u201dThis young person\u2019s name was Zhao Feng. Half a year ago, he came from the Green Leaf Village\u2019s Zhao family (side branch family) to the Sun Feather Zhao family sect, relying on his superb performance.At the Green Leaf Branch, he was a genius for his age and was the first to reach the 1st rank of the Martial Pathway. From then on, he left the life of mortals and stepped into the gateway of cultivation.At that time, every old person in the village praised him for his talent, saying his future could not be measured\u2026..His family sect, parents, they all had high hopes for him\u2026..However, only Zhao Feng knew how many more times the effort he put in compared to his peers, allowing him to become the genius of Green Leaf Village\u2026\u2026Green Leaf Village family\u2026. was one of the main Zhao family sects\u2019 side branch. Every 5 years, there would be 2 people recommended into the main sect.The person who came with Zhao Feng was \u201cZhao Xue\u201d, a girl who reached the 1st rank of the Martial Pathway only 2 months after him.After leaving Green Leaf Village, Zhao Feng was full of fighting will, determined to go to the main Zhao family sect and show off his skills.However, only after he went to the main Zhao family sect did he realize that he was just a frog at the bottom of a well\u2026\u2026In terms of population, Green Leaf Village Zhao family only had 100 people, with only 7 to 8 people around his own age.At the main Zhao family however, there were tens of thousands of people, and they controlled large portions of land, mines and resources. Compared to the Zhao family of Green Leaf Village, this family was over a 100 times larger!!!In the side branch in Green Leaf Village, he was considered a talent, even a genius for some\u2026.. Here at the Zhao sect however, he was considered to be one of the lowest level of cultivators for his age, a lowly outer disciple.In the Zhao sect, there were many youths his age who had broken through to the 2nd rank of the Martial Path. There were even some who were talented, having broken into the 3rd rank. And according to some rumours, some of the families\u2019 geniuses had already broken through to the 4th rank\u2026..Confronted with this reality, Zhao Feng started to realize that he was nothing compared to them. He was innocently ignorant and small in comparison.Also, \u201cZhao Xue\u201d, the beautiful girl who came with him from Green Leaf Village, she slowly became distant from him after entering the Zhao sect. She also interacted more and more with one of the top 3 disciples amongst the outer disciples.Looking back, when \u201cZhao Xue\u201d was still at Green Leaf village, she looked up to him in awe and even adored him. However, at that time, Zhao Feng only focused on cultivating, and ignored herFrom then on, he became more and more desperate and put in more effort into his cultivation after feeling despair.He made an oath: that he would take a spot at the top at Sun Feather City in the Zhao sect.Otherwise, he would never go back to Green Leaf Village!******After washing up, Zhao Feng took a deep breath and then ran towards the family sect\u2019s martial arts field.\u201cHah! Hah!\u201d \u2026\u2026..Zhao Feng took a half step with both fists carrying the wind, and practiced the Zhao sect\u2019s \u201cFlaming Metal Fists\u201d.\u201cFlaming Metal Fists\u201d was only a core martial art, but Zhao Feng practiced it carefully, polishing it beautifully.In laymen\u2019s terms, normal martial arts were put into 5 categories: Core, Low, Middle, High, and Peak.Core martial arts, the lowest of martial arts, were used to strengthen one\u2019s body and blood, the damage dealt by them was very restricted.Normally, the higher the rank of a martial art, the higher the damage dealt by it would be and the better it would be for cultivating.However, with Zhao Feng\u2019s side branch identity, as well as having no exceptional talent, it was very hard for him to learn martials arts of a higher rank.\u201cI have been staying at the 1st rank of the Martial Path for a long time. However, to break through to the 2nd rank, I still lack some time.\u201dAfter practicing for a while, Zhao Feng\u2019s face was raining with sweat, and his breathing rate was quick.Zhao Feng\u2019s talent wasn\u2019t considered bad, the reason why he couldn\u2019t catch up to the others was because he didn\u2019t have martial skills of a higher rank. He also wasn\u2019t rich, like the main family disciples who could buy precious pills to increase their cultivation speed.Some say a few disciples of the Zhao sect would use these precious pills from birth to strengthen their bodies. Before reaching 10 years of age, they had already broken through the 1st rank of the Martial Path, gaining a certain advantage compared to others.At the starting line, Zhao Feng was already separated too far from them. Half an hour later, the sun slowly rose into view.At the martial arts field, some of the Zhao sect disciples slowly but steadily came, and some laughed and played with one another.However, when their visions landed on Zhao Feng, their eyes suddenly became cold, and some even showed disdain.This attitude wasn\u2019t just pointed at Zhao Feng alone. The Zhao sect disciples looked down upon everyone who came from the side branches. In front of those who came from the side branches, they felt a certain amount of power!When Zhao Feng was lost in his thoughts, a sound came whistling from this back: \u201cLittle broomstick! Stop there!\u201d\u201cPah!\u201dA hand as strong as metal hit him hard on the shoulder.\u201cIt\u2019s you\u2026.\u201dZhao Feng was caught off balance and almost fell. Luckily, his core skills were good so he steadied himself.The guy who came was a youth dressed in black. His body was fit and muscular, and he had thick eyebrows. His eyes had a tinge of playfulness inside of them as he looked down upon Zhao Feng who had just steadied himself.\u201cZhao Kun! What is the meaning of this?\u201d Zhao Feng had a face full of anger and wanted to hit Zhao Kun.When Zhao Feng first came to the Zhao sect, the two of them had a little conflict. This was because Zhao Kun was mocking those who came from the side branches and Zhao Feng was dissatisfied with him.Zhao Kun was a person who took revenge at every possible opportunity, and from then on, when he found Zhao Feng he would humiliate him in every way.\u201cZhao Kun! With your strength, if you cannot take this side branch disciple in ten moves, then it would not be cool!\u201d\u201cTen moves? Zhao Kun is already at the peak of the 2nd rank of the Martial Path, to fight that kid, I think three moves will be enough!\u201d\u201cThree moves? If they fight straight on, it will not be that easy!\u201d The disciples nearby said, ready to watch the show. Most people did not care about what happened, so they spoke without restraint.\u201cThree moves? Hahaha\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Kun raised his head and laughed with a look of disdain on his face, \u201cYou are all looking down on me, Zhao Kun! To beat this kid, I will only need one move!\u201dOnly need one move!The disciples who were present had looks of shock on their faces.\u201cOne move?\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s eyebrows crunched up and his face changed. The anger in his heart also rose again.He and Zhao Kun only had 1 rank in difference between them. If Zhao Kun did well, maybe he could win in 3 moves. That was true.However, just 1 move\u2026..This was a humiliation!Facing Zhao Kun\u2018s provocative eyes, Zhao Feng calmed down soon and thought, \u201cI cannot fall into this trap. Even if I live through this one move, he will still humiliate me after.\u201dHaving been at the Zhao sect for half a year, Zhao Feng had been beaten a few times and had learned to bear with it.\u201cI am quite tired from training today. Let me rest a few days, and then I will fight you.\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s face was expressionless and he then left without another word.His performance gave Zhao Kun who was the same age, a pause.\u201cOk, kiddo, I will let you off the hook today, but the next time we see each other, do not forget about today\u2019s \u20181-move battle\u2019.\u201d Zhao Kun\u2019s eyes gave off a cold and cunning feel.1-move battle?Zhao Feng\u2019s heart sped up once more, and thought: \u201cIt looks like Zhao Kun isn\u2019t going letting me off the hook.\u201d\u201cI must reach the 2nd rank of the Martial Path soon. Only then can I fight Zhao Kun.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s heart tensed up once more.After leaving the martial arts field, Zhao Feng returned home.Since Zhao Feng managed to enter the Zhao main family sect, his parents also gained a bit of his \u201cfame\u201d and entered the Zhao sect.This was supposed to be his parents\u2019 fame.Zhao Feng however only felt ashamed because his performance at the Zhao sect might make his parents feel disappointed. He might also disappoint those of the older generation who had high expectations of him at the village.\u201cI am back.\u201dA deep, calm man walked out. It was Zhao Feng\u2019s father. Zhao Tianyang.\u201cFeng\u2019er, come quick and have some food!\u201d This was his mother, Zhao Shi, who had a caring look on her face as she brought out some food from the kitchen.Every time Zhao Feng came home, he was able to feel the warmth and love here.\u201cThanks mom\u2026.. This tastes so good!\u201d Zhao Feng mumbled through his mouth, which was full of food.When they ate, Zhao Tianyang and Zhao Shi didn\u2019t speak, as if there was something on their mind.\u201cFather, Mother, what are you\u2026.\u201d Zhao Feng saw that his parents had solemn expressions and looked as if they had something to say. Zhao Tianyang and Zhao Shi looked at one another, and then they took a long sigh.\u201cLet me say it. Just not long ago, the sect\u2019s higher level sent some people over with a letter.\u201d Zhao Tianyang paused for a moment.\u201cThe sect\u2019s higher level?\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t understand.Zhao Tianyang had a solemn face and said: \u201cThe sect has now made some new rules. If the side branch\u2019s youths cannot break through to the 2nd rank, they will have no right to participate in the \u2018family sparring contest\u2019. If\u2026. before the age of fifteen, they cannot reach the 3rd rank, they will be sent back to their branches.\u201dWhat!Zhao Feng\u2019s heart stopped for a second and his face changed dramatically.The family sparring competition was where all the youths fought to show off their skills. The ones who won would get rich rewards and have a chance to become an inner disciple, who would be fully trained by the family.Thus, the family sparring competition was a chance to turn into a dragon from a fish for the outer disciples.If they lost the chance to enter, it was considered to be the same as being thrown away by the sect!And the rule that made Zhao Feng\u2019s heart cold was the last one \u2013 Before the age of 15, those who are not able to achieve the 3rd rank of the martial path, will be sent back to the branch families.\u201cNo, no, this cannot be true\u2026.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s voice was soft, and both his hands clenched together.He and his parents wouldn\u2019t have the face to be sent back to the Green Leaf Village.\u201cThis rule is only set towards the side branch disciples.\u201d His mother Zhao Qi had a look of dissatisfaction on her face.\u201cMother, Father, it is ok. I will train even harder and reach the 2nd rank of the Martial Path before the family sparring competition.\u201d Zhao Feng clenched his teeth and said while trembling.\u201cThere are still two months left, and to register, you need to sign up a month earlier. To break through to the 2nd rank in a month is probably not easy.\u201dZhao Tian Tang shook his head.Only a month\u2019s time?Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes were dim as if he fell into darkness.If there were 2 months left, and he doubled his efforts, there was a 20 to 30 percent chance of success. To breakthrough in a month however, he didn\u2019t have any confidence at all!After staying silent for a long time, Zhao Shi wiped the corner of her eyes and spoke softly: \u201cFeng\u2019er, it doesn\u2019t matter if you fail\u2026\u2026 you still make us proud\u2026. The most that will happen is us returning to Green Leaf village and living a normal life.\u201d\u201cYeah! If we return to Green Leaf Village, you will still be the most talented one there \u2013 I would rather have you be the head of a chicken than the tail of a phoenix!\u201dZhao Tianyang nodded his head in agreement.Being parents, they would rather have their children be safe, even if their lives would be normal..Return to Green Leaf village?\u201cNo!\u201dZhao Feng shook his head furiously, \u201cI am not going back to Green Leaf Village to lead a normal life!\u201dHe once swore an oath. To perform well, earn a spot in the Zhao sect and in Sun Feather City, and own his own land.His heart yearned towards the 9th rank of the Martial Path and the land that lies beyond in the outer world\u2026.How could I be willing to lose and return in this manner?Zhao Feng restrained himself from crying, screamed, and merely ran out of the house.\u201cFeng\u2019er! Don\u2019t be stubborn\u2026\u2026\u201dHis parents called out.\u201cBoom!\u201dSuddenly, thunder and lightning howled in the sky and it started raining outside. Zhao Feng kept the despair in his heart, howled back at the sky and ran into the rain. At this time, the lightning shone everywhere, making Zhao Feng\u2019s face light up.\u201cNot good!\u201dZhao Feng felt a pressure bearing towards him, and so, as he looked up he was shocked by what he saw.From birth, he had never seen such lightning, closely packed together, like a spider\u2019s web.At that short moment, the lightning above seemed to be under some kind of power, which caused the dimension to crack.\u201cSheeeeeeew \u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\u201dA black streak came from outer space. It passed through the lightning and caused beautiful ripples to appear that seemed like a dream.It was impossible to imagine what that \u201cblack line\u201d was, it was even able to ignore the power of lightning.\u201cPah! Pah!\u201dZhao Feng felt his feet go numb, his hair and clothes turn black, and thunder rang in his ears nonstop.The whole world suddenly went dead silent.\u201cThis is\u2026\u2026\u201dHis face was white, looking down at his feet he saw a weird black marble, like an eyeball. It was this item that caused the black line.\u201cPeng! Peng!\u201dThe eye-like marble seemed like it had life, giving off a thumping sound as it 'stared\u201d Zhao Feng right in the eye.However, the eyeball\u2019s thumping seemed to thump in sync with his own heart, giving Zhao Feng a friendly feeling.At this moment, he felt some kind of summoning.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cDoes this item have life?\u201d He held his breath, ready for any signs of danger. However, before he could move.\u201cPoom!\u201dThe eyeball-like marble turned into an afterimage as it shot into Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye.\u201cAhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Zhao Feng screamed and then fainted.Before he fainted, he only had one thought: \u201cI\u2019m screwed\u2026\u2026\u2026 my eye has been blinded!\u201dNovel InfoNovel InfoAll ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 2": "Chapter 2Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 2 \u2013 The battle of one moveNot knowing how much time had passed, Zhao Feng started to regain his consciousness, but he was not able to feel his body.The only thing he felt was the pain coming from his left eye.Left eye?Zhao Feng turned cold, and suddenly remembered what happened. Before he fainted, the weird eyeball shaped marble stabbed straight into his left eye.If there wasn\u2019t any accidents, my left eye might\u2019ve been blinded and can probably be compared with those ugly and berserk \u201cOne-eyed dragons\u201d.When he thought up to here, Zhao Feng had the urge to cry.Peh!Peh!Peh!Peh!\u2026\u2026There was a sound similar to that of a heartbeat, giving off a familiar and kind feel, resonating from the left eye, which had been punctured.Shoosh!He thought about his left eye and in that moment, his consciousness merged with his left eye.Boom!His brain suddenly shook and Zhao Feng consciousness went into a pitch black dimension.\u201cThis place is\u2026..\u201dZhao Feng had fear for the unknown, and seeing such a weird place was completely outside of his knowledge.His consciousness was attracted by the faint green light given off from the centre of the pitch black place.That faint green light seemed so mysterious, and infinitely deep. It slowly spun, as if it had survived from the Ancient times till now, giving people both a feeling of life and eternity.Zhao Feng consciousness was fully absorbed by it, and was so absorbed that he would not awaken, not until the sky turn old or when the dimension was destroyed.\u201cThe Ancient is broken, and the Ancient Gods slain will turn into a trillion dust\u2026..\u201dThe sigh that came with it seemed so ancient and sad. It reverberated around the pitch black area, as if it came from the Ancient times itself.\u201cWho\u2019s there!?\u201dZhao Feng consciousness swayed, and his whole body turned cold. He surveyed the area but could not see anyone.That sound seemed to come from the space itself.\u201cThere is a soul in the universe that is perfectly in sync with me? Is this destiny?\u201dThe mysterious voice said to itself.\u201cWho\u2019s there sneaking around!\u201dZhao Feng suppressed his fear and shouted.\u201cTo continue my bloodline of the Eye, you will Rule everyone, control every race. You lucky youngster, do not disappoint me\u2026.\u201dThe pitch black area suddenly poured out an Ancient consciousness, which then faded away.Everything remained calm\u2026\u2026.Hah!Zhao Feng took a long breath, but before he could think more, a painful feeling came from his left eye.Within the room.The burning sun came through the window.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026.. My eye.\u201dZhao Feng screamed and clutched his left eye which was now swollen red and burned with pain.At this time, Zhao Feng suddenly woke back up into reality.This was his room.Zhao Feng laid on the bed, and his body still had charred pieces from when he was struck by lightning.At this time, the pain coming from his left eye made him sweat and toss around in the room.It was good that, as time went, the pain eventually faded away.\u201cMy eye\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Feng had a face full of worry, and slowly loosened the grip around his left eye.He was certain that his left eye could still see the light.However, when his left eye saw the first ray of sunlight, the strong burn in his eye made him squint, but it still made Zhao Feng let out his breath.His left eye eventually adapted to the sunlight and could finally see the outside world.However, the thing that came after made Zhao Feng go into shock.At that moment, the whole world seemed to have become one of tens of thousands of different colours.The vision of his left eye made everything seem perfectly clear and beautiful.Zhao Feng even saw the particles in the air, which certainly wasn\u2019t what normal vision could see.He even clearly saw ants on a tree 100 metres away, and the veins on a leaf.\u201cWhat is going on? My left eye can even\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Feng thought about it after the shock passed and revealed some happiness on his face.He was certain that his left eye had undergone a series of changes and was at least 10 times, or more, stronger than the original eye.Zhao Feng took out a mirror and looked at it closely, the left eye\u2019s size was the same as before.The only difference was that the centre of his eye was darker than the original.And when he fully used his left eye, the eyeball would give off a faint glow of green light.These changes, although not very obvious, sped up Zhao Feng\u2019s heartbeat.\u201cDid\u2026.. did that mysterious eye merge with my left eye?\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s heart was happy but also worried at the same time.After a while he took a deep breath and walked out his room.\u201cFeng\u2019er, you did not wake up for one day and one night, do not make me feel worried.\u201dZhao Shi saw that her son was all right and was super happy.\u201cMother, I am all right! I might even have gotten lucky from this disaster.\u201dZhao Feng laughed.However, his face soon turned, \u201cWait! Mother, did you say\u2026. That I was unconscious for one day and one night?\u201d\u201cYes, that day you were hit by lightning, but the alchemist said that you were just unconscious.\u201dZhao Shi wiped her eyes and felt scared by what might have happened.When they talked, Zhao Feng\u2019s stomach growled, only then did he feel the hunger.\u201cCome! I will make you some food to eat.\u201dZhao Shi went to the kitchen and busied around.At this time, Zhao Feng kept on using his left eye to observe everything and felt that his body also went through some changes.The most obvious change was his reaction speed.\u201cMmmmmm\u2026..\u201dWhen they were eating, Zhao Feng eyes landed upon a fly.His left eye saw the fly\u2019s flying route, he could even differentiate the gender and he also saw the stripes on its wings.Shoosh!He waved his chopsticks on instinct.Suddenly, the humming stopped.Hahaha\u2026.Zhao Feng looked at the fly killed by his chopsticks and laughed deep in his heart.That felt good!That felt damn nice!Because of his left eye, Zhao Feng\u2019s reaction speed and senses had far surpassed that of normal people.After eating, Zhao Feng felt full of energy so he walked towards the martial arts field.He had a feeling, that the change in his left eye could possibly change his life\u2026\u2026His left eye gave off sizzles of heat and after that, also gave off a \u201cpeh!peh!\u201d heartbeat sound.He didn\u2019t know that as the mysterious eyeball merged with him, his bloodline and body was slowly changing.Martial Arts Field.Zhao Feng was the same as normal and started to practise his fist core martial arts.\u201cHahaha! Zhao Feng, you\u2019re finally here, I thought you\u2019d be a turtle hiding in your shell\u2026..\u201dA laugh came from the other side of the martial arts field.Damn it!Zhao Feng said damn in his heart and then looked at the muscular Zhao Kun, who was taking big strides while coming over.He then remembered the \u201c1 move battle\u201d with Zhao Kun.With Zhao Kun\u2019s laugh, many sect disciples in the martial arts field came gathering around.\u201cLooks like it cannot be avoided\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Feng could only walk over.\u201cZhao Feng, get ready. One move! I\u2019ll only need one move to make you go down!\u201dZhao Kun\u2019s massive body seemed like a tiger and pressured towards Zhao Feng.As soon as his words finished.Using a weird stance, his two hands and body contracted, then like a poisonous snake, gave a dark and creepy feeling.Zhao Feng felt a chill, as if he was locked onto by a poisonous snake.\u201cWhoa, it is the high ranked martial art Thirteen changes of the Poisonous Snake!\u201dFrom the crowd came an excited shout from someone who recognising Zhao Kun\u2019s move.\u201cHigh ranked martial art, how is this possible! Most 2nd rank disciples can only go to the \u201cMartial Arts Library\u201d and get middle rank martial arts, how could Zhao Kun get a high ranked one?\u201d\u201cYou might not know this but Zhao Kun\u2019s grandfather is one of the sect elders\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cNo wonder Zhao Kun has confidence in winning with one move, it is because he\u2019s learned the Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake!\u201dThe disciples around the area all felt chilly, even some of those whose cultivation exceeded Zhao Kun gave him a solemn look.\u201cIt is a high rank martial arts skill.\u201dZhao Feng took a cold breath.At the Zhao sect, disciples under the 4th rank of the Martial Path could only learn low or middle ranked martial arts.As for Zhao Feng, since he had not even achieved the 2nd rank of the Martial Path yet, he could not enter the sect\u2019s \u201cMartial Arts Library\u201d, so he could not even learn low rank martial arts.Thirteen Change of the Poisonous Snake was a high rank martial arts skill, and the damage dealt by it was way higher compared to low and middle ranked martial arts, not to mention core rank martial arts.At this moment, Zhao Kun\u2019s moving hand even gave Zhao Feng a huge pressure, as if he just needed to move and the poisonous snake would attack.\u201cNo wonder Zhao Kun has confidence to take me down in a single move!\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s heart sped up, as he knew that, under normal circumstances, he couldn\u2019t take one move from a high rank martial art skill.And even then, Zhao Kun\u2019s cultivation was higher than his own by 1 rank.Peh!Peh!\u2026\u2026Under the pressure, Zhao Feng felt his left eye move, this gave him an excited feeling.Zhao Feng now put all of his power into the left eye and set the target on Zhao Kun.Not one realised that, at this moment, Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye gave off a faint green glow\u2026\u2026Shoosh!Zhao Feng felt like he had gone into super-vision mode. In his vision, Zhao Kun\u2019s body was enlarged, and every change, including his breathing rate, heartbeat, the body\u2019s muscles, veins, they were all seen with his left eye.And at that moment, the world seemed to slow down by many times.However, the speed of the world didn\u2019t slow down.The change was Zhao Feng\u2019s own reaction speed!Under the pressure, Zhao Feng\u2019s heart felt extremely peaceful and calm.His opponent, Zhao Kun, got an unknown shiver and had a feeling as if all of his secrets had been seen.\u201c3rd Change of the Poisonous Snake!\u201dZhao Kun had a face full of dimness and used his strongest strike without hesitation. His body was like a poisonous snake, and like lightning, had both extreme speed and power.Shoosh!In a flash, Zhao Kun 2 fingers were together, and like a poisonous snake\u2019s teeth, slashed through the air as they stabbed towards Zhao Feng.So fast!Many of the sects disciples thought.Many youths of the 2nds rank of the Martial Path did not even manage to see how Zhao Kun moved.Just as Zhao Kun\u2019s teeth like fingers were about to to hit Zhao Feng.Pah!Suddenly, a strong fist punched through the air, hitting Zhao Kun\u2019s arm, making him fall.\u201cWhat happened?\u201dZhao Kun felt his mind shudder as his body turned stiff due to shock, his arm turning numb.His fingers, which were only half an inch away from Zhao Feng\u2019s chest, could not move forward another bit.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhoosh\u2014\u2014Zhao Kun\u2019s stomach suddenly felt pain as he was sent flying out with a scream.\u201cWhat happened!?\u201dAll of the disciples shouted in shock.\u201cOne move, you\u2019ve lost\u2026\u2026\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And I won in one move?Before the battle, because of the changes in the left eye, Zhao Feng was confident that by relying on his reaction speed and vision, he would be able to block one of Zhao Kun\u2019s moves, and if used well, he could be able to block more than 10 moves.The result however, was well out of his expectations.Zhao Kun\u2019s attack was very fast for some of the bystanders, but under his left eye, all of his movements were as clear as day.And when the left eye was activated to its fullest capabilities, Zhao Feng felt that the opponent\u2019s moves seemed slow and clumsy.He was stunned because he saw faults in Zhao Kun\u2019s skill.Faults!Faults in a high ranked martial art!Zhao Feng didn\u2019t understand it either, how could he see the opponent\u2019s faults so easily? Maybe it was because the opponent hadn\u2019t fully polished the skill.At last, Zhao Feng reacted on instinct, just like how he had with the fly, and gave the opponent a deadly hit, which allowed him to win in one move.Hua!All the disciples on the martial arts field were shocked.\u201cDid I see wrong!? The one that lost was Zhao Kun!\u201d\u201cYou are right! The person who lost was Zhao Kun!\u201dAll the Zhao disciples opened their eyes wide and had weird faces on.\u2026\u2026.\u201cHow is this possible\u2026\u2026\u2026. How could I lose to this guy?\u201dZhao Kun had a questioning face.Yep!He lost so suddenly he didn\u2019t understand.At this time, the expressions on Zhao Feng and Zhao Kun\u2019s faces were comparable.\u201cIt was by accident!\u201dWhen the Zhao disciples saw the expression on Zhao Kun\u2019s face, they understood.After this was said, all of them started agreeing.\u201cYou are right! This kids luck must be too good, he won by accident.\u201d\u201cHis luck must be too good\u2026\u2026\u201dThe crowd agreed on the reason for Zhao Feng\u2019s victory.\u201cLuck? Maybe.\u201dZhao Feng gave a faint smile and turned to leave.\u201cKid! Stay there!\u201dZhao Kun clutched his stomach as he slowly stood up before he, in a dark manner, said, \u201cZhao Feng! You were just lucky before, that\u2019s why you won. Let\u2019s fight again!\u201d\u201cFight again?\u201dZhao Feng scrunched up his eyebrows and looked at Zhao Kun, \u201cFirstly, you\u2019re hurt. Secondly, I don\u2019t have time.\u201dAfter saying this he turned towards a corner in the martial arts field and left behind a group of disciples with stunned faces.\u201cBastard! After I\u2019m healed, I\u2019ll perfect my Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake, then I\u2019ll fight you.\u201dZhao Kun had a face of anger as he then left without another word.Looking back on the fight, Zhao Kun had his own reasons of why he lost, and there were 3 main reasons:Firstly, he looked down on his opponent.Secondly, he had only learnt the first 3 moves of the Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake, and there were still many faults as it was yet to be perfected.Thirdly, Zhao Feng had too much luck.\u2026\u2026On the other side of the martial arts field, Zhao Feng started to practise.\u201cThe reason I was able to win the last fight is mainly because Zhao Kun looked down on me too much, as well as the fact that he have yet to perfect the high ranked martial art skill, which allowed for me to the faults\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Feng knew the answer in his heart.Zhao Kun would definitely not go easy on him in the next fight, and if he perfects the Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake\u2019s first 3 moves faults, then Zhao Feng doesn\u2019t have any confidence in winning again.That was because the difference between the 1st rank and the 2nd rank of the martial path was too big.The Martial Path had 9 ranks in total, the first three ranks were known as \u201cPower ranks\u201d.The \u201cPower ranks\u201d were about gaining more strength and increasing one\u2019s foundation.So the 1st rank and the 2nd rank of the martial path had a difference of around 100kg\u2019s in terms of strength.That\u2019s why, under normal conditions, to be a 1st rank and beat the 2nd rank of the martial path was so surprising, even more so to win by 1 move.\u201cThe key point is still to increase my strength!\u201dZhao Feng took a deep breath and started to practise \u201cFlaming Metal Fist\u201d again.The first move\u2026 The second move\u2026.. The third move\u2026\u2026The \u201cFlaming Metal Fist\u201d seemed to be as smooth as water, smoother than it had ever been.Hah!As Zhao Feng finished his moves, he had an excited look on his face. The \u201cFlaming Metal Fist\u201d had a total of 32 moves, and he could now finish them in one breath, a much faster speed than previously, the power of the moves had also increased.After finishing the moves, he felt that his blood flowed better and faster than before, as if it was burning.Peh!Peh!\u2026..At the same time, the beat coming from his left eye became even more obvious.Zhao Feng closed his eyes and his consciousness interacted with the pitch black dimension.At the centre of the dimension, there was a faint green light.At first, the faint green light had a radius of around 60cm, and was especially faint.Now however, the faint green light\u2019s length and brightness seemed to have increased.\u201cCould it be? Is the left eye\u2019s abilities directly linked to my own strength?\u201dZhao Feng guessed in his heart.The changes in his left eye gave him the chance to change his destiny. Firstly, it let him beat Zhao Kun, secondly, when he practised his moves, they became super smooth.\u201cAgain!\u201dZhao Feng eyes became sharp as he started to practise \u201cFlaming Metal Fist\u201d again.Hu Hu Hu\u2026\u2026.Zhao Feng\u2019s movement speed became faster and faster, and the moves started to perfectly link with one another.After practising it for the 3rd time, the speed had already become 2 times faster than before, and the damage had also increased by heaps.Through his breathing, he felt his blood circulate better and the parts of his body that could not be toughened before had also started to become stronger.\u201cAt this speed, I will just need a few more days to break through to the 2nd rank of the Martial Path.\u201dZhao Feng felt that his increase was very obvious.He practised until night and then wiped his sweat and headed back towards his home.After arriving home, he still was thinking about the change in his left eye.\u201cTo continue my bloodline of the Eye, you will Rule everyone, control every race. You lucky youngster, do not disappoint me\u2026.\u201dHe remembered the voice that came from the pitch black dimension before he fainted.\u201cThis eye might have come from an Ancient God-like existence, and in an accident, merged with my own eye.\u201d Zhao Feng assumed.Even at night, when he opened his eye, he could still see everything outside.The darkness of night had almost zero influence on Zhao Feng. His eye still saw the birds that were a few miles away.Zhao Feng lay on his bed at night and felt his left eye releasing sizzles of heat, which merged with his blood.Under this weird feeling, Zhao Feng fell asleep.The second morning.Zhao Feng woke up, extended his 4 limbs and went to practise in the small courtyard.\u201cThis yards too old, and the environment is bad, When I am stronger, I am definitely going to let my parents live inside a big yard.\u201dZhao Feng thought in his heart.Quickly, he began to practise the 32 moves of the \u201cFlaming Metal Fist.\u201dHu Hu Hu\u2026..The fists carried the wind and now contained extreme power.As soon as Zhao Feng threw a few punches, he felt that something was wrong.Between his breaths, his blood was raging and gave off an aura of power, every punch contained at least 200-250 kg\u2019s of force.\u201cWhat!\u201dZhao Feng was shocked, and his two fists burned in 2 patches of red light.Ka Ka Ka \u2014\u2014One of the punches hit the big tree in front of him, and a branch, as thick as a fist, snapped into pieces.\u201cNo! This definitely is not the power of a 1st rank, could it be\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s heart jumped.To prove his thoughts, he took a deep breath and put all of his power into one stomp.Peh!The ground shook and the layers of earth crumbled, leaving Zhao Feng\u2019s footprint half an inch deep into the ground.His expression turned happy, then one of his palms hit a stone that was at least 30 kg\u2019s , and broke it into pieces.This kind of power wasn\u2019t something that the 1st rank of the martial path could do.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201c2nd rank of the martial path\u2026.. I\u2019ve broken through to the 2nd rank of the martial path!\u201dZhao Feng closed his eyes and began to feel the power coursing through his body.He first thought that breaking through to the 2nd rank would at least take a few days, but didn\u2019t realise that he broke through just after one night\u2019s sleep.His consciousness went inside his left eye, there, Zhao Feng found that the faint green light had now extended from around 60cm to 67cm.He felt that his energy was better than before and that it also had different changes which could not be explained\u2026\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They could rip apart tigers and destroy bears with their bare hands.Although Zhao Feng had only broken through to the 2nd rank, he had around 250-300 kg\u2019s of strength, which was well outside the capabilities of normal people. If it was accompanied by strong martial skills, tens of normal people wouldn\u2019t even be able to reach him.\u201cIf I can reach the 3rd rank of the Martial Path, and have around 350-400 kg\u2019s of strength, my overall strength will at least double.\u201dZhao Feng thought in his heart.Of course, the thing that he yearned for was the 4th rank of the Martial Path.The 4th to 6th rank of the Martial Path were known as the \u201cAccumulation Ranks\u201d, they were also known as Martial Artists, those who were real Martial Artists!After entering this realm, the Martial Artist wouldn\u2019t just have a strong body and blood. They could also strengthen their organs and use the power of \u201cInner strength\u201d, which surpassed that of pure muscle attacks.Once they reached Martial Artist, they would leave the realms of mundane people and entered a higher level.Back at Green Leaf Village, Zhao Feng had the urge to become a true Martial Artist, and entering the Zhao sect had made this dream come one step closer.\u2026\u2026After he entered the 2nd rank of the martial path, Zhao Feng immediately told his parents.2nd Rank of the martial path?His father Zhao Tianyang and his mother Zhao Shi were both surprised but let out deep breaths.As Zhao Feng was able to reach the 2nd rank at this age without the use of outside help, his talent could be said to be better than some people.\u201cAll you have to do next for the next two months is to prepare for the \u201cFamily Sparring Contest\u201d. We do not need you to do extremely well, just do not lose face.\u201dZhao Tianyang revealed a happy smile.Zhao Shi also had a pleased smile.For Zhao Feng to reach this step, they were very pleased and did not have higher expectations.However, Zhao Feng\u2019s target wasn\u2019t restricted to just this. He wanted to become a true Martial Artist, maybe even reach the pinnacle of Martial Arts.\u201cAfter breaking through to the 2nd rank, my status within the sect is now higher and I have the right to enter the first floor of the \u201cMartial Arts Library\u201d.\u201dThe sects \u201cMartial Arts library\u201d contained many different martial arts skills.Thinking about this, Zhao Feng immediately went towards the Martial Arts Library.\u201cBrother Feng!\u201dHalfway, a slightly shocked voice from a girl stopped him.The young girl\u2019s voice had a familiar sound and felt comfortable to listen to.Zhao Feng\u2019s body turned stiff.From his side came a boy and girl whose ages weren\u2019t very old.The male was purple clothed, had thick eyebrows, a straight tall back and sharpness in his eyes. His cultivation had reached the peak of the 3rd rank, the other disciples around them felt the pressure he emitted.\u201cHe is the sects 3rd ranking disciple of the outer disciples \u201cZhao Yijian\u201d!\u201dThe people around them exclaimed, with faces full of worry and fear.The one that came with Zhao Yijian was a young woman wearing white, whose age was the same as Zhao Feng, around 13 or 14, she had a clear beautiful face.\u201cLittle Sister Xue.\u201dZhao Feng looked at the white clothed girl and his mouth subconsciously curled into a mocking smile.The girl in front of him was the one who entered the sect with him half a year ago, \u201cZhao Xue\u201d.Back at Green Leaf Village, Zhao Xue was a huge fan of his. However, after they entered the Zhao sect they became distant from one another, they were almost total strangers now.After Zhao Xue entered the Zhao sect, using her beauty, she quickly became good friends with Zhao Yijian, who was ranked 3rd of the outer disciples, and then, by using her connections, she achieved the 2nd of the martial path half a month ago.At this moment, Zhao Xue said something to Zhao Yijian.\u201cOk, but just do not take too long.\u201dZhao Yijian nodded his head and leaned aside, not even bothering to look at Zhao Feng.Zhao Xue walked in front of Zhao Feng and,in a complex manner, and with a little sigh, said, \u201cBrother Feng, you have finally broken through to the 2nd rank. However, Xue\u2019er is going to give you some advice, do not be too stubborn. After entering the sect, I have realised that the place we started at is too low compared to the ones here.\u201d\u201cWhat do you want to say?\u201dZhao Feng broke off her sentence and responded with a cold face.Zhao Xue had a bit of anger of her face, but she still bit her teeth and said, \u201cBrother Feng, Xue\u2019er is going to advice you one more time, go to brother Yijian and pledge yourself to him. With his help, only then will you merge with the main Zhao sect, that way you can avoid problems\u2026\u2026\u201dPledge?Zhao Feng made a cold laugh. He won\u2019t pledge to anyone in his whole life.Zhao Yijian had a cold aura and was extremely arrogant. Every time he saw Zhao Feng, it was with his nostrils, as if he was too high up compared to him.Seeing Zhao Feng\u2019s expression, Zhao Xue immediately knew, as they grew up together she understood Zhao Feng very well.Zhao Xue walk back to Zhao Yijian\u2019s side and murmured something.\u201cHmph! He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s good for him, this useless garbage.\u201dZhao Yijian said in a cold voice.\u201cUseless garbage?\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s eyebrows scrunched.Maybe it because he saw Zhao Feng so unwilling, but Zhao Yijian took a pause and coldly said, \u201cI\u2019ve heard that you\u2019re the genius of Green Leaf village? However, at the Zhao sect, you\u2019re just a little bug! We\u2019ll meet at the \u201cFamily Sparring contest\u201d and I\u2019ll beat you in just one move.\u201d\u201cJust like what I would say, we\u2019ll meet at the contest.\u201dZhao Feng spat bitterly and then turned towards the Martial Arts library.He didn\u2019t want to keep on talking, since they were bound to fight 2 months later, and the one with greater strength would win.As Zhao Xue\u2019s eyesight passed by Zhao Feng, it flashed ever so slightly.At this point, she felt a strange feeling from Zhao Feng. A feeling that she couldn\u2019t understand.\u201cHe sure thinks he\u2019s good.\u201dZhao Yijian snorted.He didn\u2019t even think of Zhao Feng as a serious opponent!At the sects outer disciples, those that had entered the 3rd rank of the martial path didn\u2019t exceed 60 people, and to rank 3rd out of these\u2026 It could be seen that he had some great skills up his sleeve.Zhao Xue gave off a deep sigh in her heart, Zhao Feng was just finding trouble for himself.Zhao Xue understood Zhao Yijian\u2019s strength very well. Some of the 3rd ranks couldn\u2019t even block one move of his.\u2026\u2026..After a while, Zhao Feng came to the sect\u2019s important grounds, the Martial Arts Library.The Martial Arts Library was very important to the sect, and therefore had elders guarding it.\u201cBranch disciple?\u201dThe white-clothed elder inside the Martial Arts library looked at Zhao Feng\u2019s identity plate, and scrunched up his eyebrows.\u201cGreat elder.\u201dZhao Feng had a polite face on, he knew the elders strength.From his left eye, he felt a mysterious force coming from the elder. It was a layer of red aura, which was between their blood and skin, but was constantly moving through their veins, and could attack at any time. It could also attack through the air and crush metal into powder.Zhao Feng knew that the white-clothed elder had already cultivated \u201cinner strength\u201d to a high degree, it could destroy one hundred of him in an instant.Only those that were at the 4th rank of the martial path or higher could have inner strength.Zhao Xue, Zhao Kun, these martial learners wouldn\u2019t have inner strength.Zhao Feng took a bow and said: \u201cElder, I want to go into the second floor of the martial arts library.\u201d\u201cAchieving the 2nd rank at 14 years of age is average. However, before you become an inner disciple, I must tell you that branch disciples and main disciples have different treatments in the martial arts library.\u201dThe white-robed elder said.When Zhao Feng heard this, he paused a second, but then thought about the new rules of the sect and immediately understood.\u201cElder, please go on.\u201dZhao Feng knew that before having absolute power, he didn\u2019t have any right to discuss the rules.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe white-clothed elder said with an expressionless face: \u201cthose with the 2nd rank of the martial path can only enter the first floor of the martial arts library. The first floor of the martial arts library have a lot of low ranked martial arts, and a few middle ranked ones. Main sect disciples can choose two middle ranked martial arts, or four low ranked martial arts at max, and the limit for borrowing these is two months. Side branch disciples can only choose one middle ranked martial art, or two low ranked martial arts, and the time limit is one month.\u201dAfter listening to the rules, Zhao Feng took a deep breath and said, \u201cThis junior understands.\u201dThe branch disciples had only half of the quantity and time compared to the main branch disciples.\u201cOk! You can go in now, but the time limit is half an hour.\u201dUnder the white-robed elder\u2019s guidance, Zhao Feng slowly stepped into the martial arts library, a place he\u2019d dreamed of coming to\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They were used to help those of the later generation hoping that they could expand the family.Usually, a sect\u2019s number and quality of martial arts determined how strong the sect would be. Zhao Feng remembered that at the Green Leaf village Zhao family, there wasn\u2019t even a martial arts library.The martial arts library was divided into 3 floors.In the first floor there was a large quantity of martial arts, but most of them were low ranked, with a few middle ranked ones there as well.The second floor apparently had the sects secret and traditional techniques. Most of them were of the high rank, there were even some peak ranked ones there!However, to enter the second floor one needed one to be at least at the 4th rank of the martial path.And the 3rd floor was just a rumour, as it had never been opened\u2026.However, for Zhao Feng, the 2nd and 3rd floors were just too far away, even the 1st floor\u2019s martial arts were something that he yearned for.He had no background in the sect, and a person with no background or exceptional talent could not access higher ranked martial arts. The Flaming Metal Fists he had was only a core rank martial art, and it was even weaker than a low ranked martial art.However, after breaking through to the 2nd rank of the martial path, he had the right to enter the 1st floor and choose a martial art.\u201cThe Zhao sect, it is no wonder that it is one of the 3 big families of the Sun Feather city, which rides on top of several hundreds of other families.\u201dZhao Feng stepped into the first floor, his breathing quickening.At the first floor, he could see a few other Zhao disciples, but all of them were using their time to choose their own martial art skills.According to the rules, those that entered the martial arts library only had half an hour to select.So everyone that entered the martial arts library didn\u2019t waste any time.\u201cI\u2019ve got half an hour and I need to choose a middle rank martial art, or two low ranked martial arts.\u201dZhao Feng took a deep breath, and scanned along the bookshelves.The 1st floor of the martial arts library had several thousand books, and every book was half an inch thick. To find one or two martial arts from such a high amount was not easy.\u201cRock Breaking Palm, Angered Dragon Fist, Leaf Picking Sword, Wind like foot\u2026\u2026\u201dDifferent kinds of martial art skills made Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes turn colourful.Shuah! Shuah! \u2026..Zhao Feng flipped the pages of these martial art skills quickly to the 1st page.These martial arts usually had their summaries on the first page.Crazy Wing Blade Blade like the wind, powerful like lightning, uses speed to win. Minimum requirement is 1st rank of the Martial Path, to train this skill is average. Rank: Low.Angered Dragon Fists Can increase the strength of the cultivator, can put all the power into one attack. Minimum requirement is 2nd rank of the martial path, to train this skill is quite hard. Rank: Peak of the Middle rank.Wind like foot A close combat skill which uses speed to win. When trained to fullest potential, can fight against many people and not lose. Minimum requirements is 1st rank of the martial path, but needs high level of understanding. Rank: Middle.Metal Sand: Increases the defence of the body. Under fully activation can go head to head with same rank opponent. Someone who can train it to a high level can use their body and fight against swords and blades. Minimum requirements is 2nd rank of the martial path and needs high will power. Rank: Middle.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201cThe martial arts library\u2019s skills are stronger than the core ranked skills by far, just as expected\u2026..\u201dZhang Feng was extremely pleased, and the skills he saw were mainly middle rank ones.After only looking through tens of books, his heart had already been moved several times.However, the martial arts library had restrictions. He could only take out 1 middle rank martial art.If I could only take out a few then that would be great\u2026..Zhao Feng felt unwilling and thought it was unfair, \u201cBranch disciples can only choose one middle martial art whereas the main disciples can choose two.\u201dTo increase his speed in choosing, Zhao Feng started to use his left eye.With his left eye, his speed increased more than 10 times\u2026.Shuah shuah shuah \u2026..Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye used an incredible speed to look through these martial arts.He only needed one look to understand it all.Looking at over thirty books, Zhao Feng fully memorised the contents of them and compared them with one another.When he had scanned over 50, Zhao Feng suddenly realised something\u2026\u2026.Not right!Zhao Feng suddenly froze.He went back to his memories of other books.In his mind the contents of the book\u2019s appeared and not a single word was wrong.\u201cThis\u2026..\u201dZhao Feng felt himself tremble with excitement.After merging with the left eye, Zhao Feng\u2019s memory had increased as well, it could be said that he only needed to look at something once and would never forget it.Especially when he activated his left eye, the contents of the books were as if they were burned into his mind.Zhao Feng never thought that he would achieve the power of \u201cnever forgetting\u201d.There were many rumours about geniuses on Azure Flower Continent, and \u201cnever forgetting\u201d was one of the attributes they had\u2026..However, \u201cnever forgetting\u201d for most people was that their memory was good, they only needed to read it once and would remember 80-90 percent of the contents.However, compared with Zhao Feng\u2019s \u201cnever forgetting\u201d, his was clearly much stronger; he was literally not able to forget.With this power, at the martial arts library, it meant that Zhao Feng could take a \u201cfew more\u201d books out.\u201cFast, fast, fast!\u201dZhao Feng had a look of excitement and started to memorise all the books he could.Shuah shuah shuah \u2026\u2026His concentration was put to max as he flipped through the pages as soon as he read them.As long as the contents were looked at by his left eye, it didn\u2019t matter if it was words or drawings, he memorised all of them.It only took Zhao Feng 20 breaths of time to fully remember a book with 50 pages.\u201cHahaha \u2026\u2026. Never forget! Good!\u201dZhao Feng felt nice, but he seemed more insane as he ripped through the books.His actions obviously caused some of the other disciples to look over.\u201cI think this guy\u2019s gone crazy\u2026\u201d\u201cMaybe it is his first time going in and he is too excited\u2026\u201dSome of the disciples looked at Zhao Feng\u2019s actions and shook their heads.Time passed by in a flash\u2026\u2026\u00be of half an hour had already passed.Hu!Zhao Feng let out a long breath. He felt tired, but it still couldn\u2019t stop the excitement in him.At this point, he had 'stolen\u201d over 100 books of martial arts.These martial arts were mainly middle ranked martial arts. It included Fists skills, Palm skills, Sword skills, Breathing skills, Footwork skills, Defence skills and many more.Because Zhao Feng kept on using his left eye, his mind became tired.Next, Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye scanned around the area and landed upon an old martial art book.The reason why he stopped here was because Zhao Feng felt that the materials this book was mode of were different from the rest.Zhao Feng picked up this book and on the top were 3 words: Lightly Floating Ferry.He flipped to the first page.Lightly Floating Ferry High Rank martial art, can make the cultivator move through the snow without leaving marks, can drift across the river and make the person feel like a bird\u2026.. When trained high enough, the person can double jump and even fly for short moments! Minimum requirements is 2nd rank of the martial path and to train in this skill is very hard. In addition, inner strength will increase the force. Achieving the highest realm will let a person be the quickest out of everyone under the 7th rank of the martial path.Zhao Feng fist thought that this was just an ordinary footwork skill, but after he saw \u201cdouble jump\u201d, and \u201cadded with Inner Strength\u201d, his eyes twinkled.\u201cDouble jump\u201d exceeded the limits of Middle rank martial arts, even some High ranked ones cannot do that!\u201cIn addition, inner Strength\u201d meant that this skill was suited for martial artists above or at the 4th rank of the martial path.And the most incredible part was: Achieving the highest realm will allow the person to have the fastest speed of all under the 7th rank of the martial path.\u201cWhat an exaggeration! Even some peak rank martial arts won\u2019t have the courage to say this.\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s eyes shone and without hesitation, he started reading the contents of Lightly Floating Ferry.He had a question in his heart though, why would such a strong skill be put at the bottom floor? And why would no one learn it?Soon, Zhao Feng found the reason.After flipping to \u00bc of the book, the words started to blur out. The main reason was that the book was too old, and the book started to mould.That meant that this book only had \u00bc of its original contents.\u201cSo unfortunate\u2026..\u201dZhao Feng was severely disappointed.However, he did not give up and continued to use his left eye on the blurred out words.Using all of his power on his left eye, Zhao Feng could just about see the words under the mould, this already exceeded a normal human\u2019s eyesight by at least 20-30 times.After reading 1-2 pages, Zhao Feng felt his mind go tired and his left eye felt as if they was no power left in it.\u201cIf I take this back I can slowly read all of it\u2019s later contents.\u201dZhao Feng thought up to here, and then took Lightly Floating Ferry out of the 1st floor of the martial arts library.\u201cLightly Floating Ferry? You want this book?\u201dThe white-robed elder asked with scrunched eyebrows.\u201cYes.\u201dZhao Feng politely said.\u201cThis book has been around for a thousand years and there are parts in it which exceed high rank martial arts by far.\u201d After talking up to here, the white-robed elder\u2019s voice turned: \u201cHowever, only \u00bc of this book can be seen. An important note: to fully train this in skill is super hard, even some geniuses cannot do it. Even if they do it\u2026.. Under the 4th rank of the martial path, the potential is restricted.At last, the white-robed elder warned: \u201cI\u2019d advise you to change a book, or else you will never break through to the 4th rank of the martial path and become a true martial artist.\u201d\u201cThank you elder for your warning, but my heart is decided.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng had a calm look on his face.Looking at the Zhao Feng leave, the white-robed elder shook his head and said, \u201cThese youths nowadays all take the highest ranked book possible.\u201dHe believed that Zhao Feng would not be able to fully learn Lightly Floating Ferry, and taking a step back, even if he could, what could a partially martial art book do?Leaving the martial arts library, Zhao Feng returned home.Sitting on his bed, he closed his eyes, and on inside of his mind the contents of around 100 martial art books quickly surfaced\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 6": "Chapter 6Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 6 \u2013 Choosing Martial Arts Skills (2)Having such a big supply of martial arts gave Zhao Feng endless excitement. He couldn\u2019t hold in his happiness and laughed with his head raised. Quite a period of time passed until he calmed down.In Cloud Country, a middle rankmartial arts skill was worth a couple hundreds of silver, and the money Zhao Feng received per month was only 10 silver.Of course he couldn\u2019t take the sects skills out and sell them, if he did he would get punished, they would destroy his cultivation and then kick him out of the sect.Zhao Feng \u201ctook\u201d a hundred books out from the martial arts library; most of them were high class and all of them had at least a past person train it so he could use their experience.However, to choose a few martial art skills from these books wasn\u2019t easy.It was good that all of these books were fully imprinted in his mind, because he only needed one thought to compare them against one another and choose the one most suitable for him.A single martial art could increase his strength; with the combination of many martial arts, it could increase his cultivation.Zhao Feng only used half an hour to choose 4 skills from the hundred books. They were:Lightly Floating Ferry, Angry Dragon Fists, Air Pushing Breathing Technique and Continuous Meteorite Arrows.Lightly Floating Ferry was definitely the highest rank skill out of them all, and Zhao Feng had a high chance of solving the missing words out after all.After that came Angry Dragon Fists and Air Pushing Breathing Technique, these skills also compensated with one another.Angry Dragon Fists was one of the peak books of the middle rank, and the damage dealt by it was high. It compressed one\u2019s strength all into one and the power was so incredible that it wasn\u2019t weaker than some of the high ranked martial arts.Zhao Feng had high expectations for Angry Dragon Fists because it increased one\u2019s body strength.Strong body strength was the foundation and minimum requirements for \u201cMartial Path Inner Strength\u201d.Martial Path Inner Strength was something that made someone a true martial artist.Air Pushing Breathing Technique was also a peak middle rank martial art. It increased one body strength, blood and body. When trained to a high level, there was a chance to understand \u201cMartial Path Inner Strength\u201d.\u201cAngry Dragon Fists and Air Pushing Breathing Technique worked perfectly well together, and when used together the power of it is at least comparable to high ranked martial arts, and there was an increase in chance to understand \u201cMartial Path inner strength\u201d.\u201dZhao Feng was overjoyed in his heart.As for the last one, Continuous Meteorite Arrows, it was a skill close to high rank.Why did he choose an arrow skill?This was because it worked well with Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye.\u201cIf I do not learn an arrow skill, then I\u2019d be sorry for my left eye\u2026..\u201dZhao Feng had a smile curl upon his lips.It could be imagined, that with his left eye\u2019s abilities, he\u2019d be a natural \u201cgodly archer\u201d, and if he perfected the arrows skill\u2026\u2026.After choosing the martial arts skills, Zhao Feng started to cultivate.He first started with the Air Pushing Breathing Technique, as strong body and blood was the foundation of cultivation. The stronger one\u2019s blood was, the damage from Angry Dragon Fists\u2019s at close combat would be stronger.Closing his eyes, Zhao Feng mind entered the contents of Air Pushing Breathing Technique.A while later, his body\u2019s blood started to move slowly\u2026\u2026\u201cThis easy?\u201dZhao Feng was shocked.According to the contents of Air Pushing Breathing Technique, most people that could move their blood needed at least 4-5 days, or even up to 10-15 days.Could it be that I am a genius?Zhao Feng thought a bit, and then disagreed with himself. Because if he was a genius, then it wouldn\u2019t have been so hard for him to break into the 2nd rank of the martial path.He realised that after merging with his mysterious left eye, his mind\u2019s energy had increased\u2026\u2026 His reaction speed, understanding and analysing speed all now exceeded that of normal people.When he was learning the Air Pushing Breathing Technique, a \u201cpeh peh\u201d sound came from Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes.At the same time, in the pitch black dimension, the 67 cm radius faint, green light was spinning at an increased rate.Half a day later.Zhao Feng had trained the Air Pushing Breathing Technique to the first level and his body gave off a faint disgusting smell of sweat.He felt that his body\u2019s strength had become stronger by 30%.I did it?Zhao Feng felt somewhat incredible.Air Pushing Breathing Technique was divided into 3 levels, and once one trained to the peak of the third level, there was a chance to under \u201cMartial Path Inner Strength\u201d.After another half day, Zhao Feng had already trained Air Pushing Breathing Technique to the peak of the first level and it was then the speed started slowing down.He changed his mind and started training in Angry Dragon Fists which paired up with Air Pushing Breathing Technique.As expected, with the foundation of Air Pushing Breathing Technique the speed of learning Angry Dragon Fists was very fast.In only half a day\u2019s\u2019 time, Zhao Feng learnt all of the 81 moves to a beginning level.Angry Dragon Fists had extreme power, especially when used with Air Pushing Breathing Technique, the exploding strength was incredible.Zhao Feng secretly clicked his tongue.The most surprising part was that after learning Angry Dragon Fists, the Air Pushing Breathing Technique broke through to the second level and even went a bit further\u2026. The two skills accompanying each other had an incredible effect.No wonder they\u2019re perfect for each other!Zhao Feng laughed in his heart.For the next 4-5 days, Zhao Feng kept on learning Angry Dragon Fists and Air Pushing Breathing Pushing Technique, and both of the skills trained at an incredible speed.At this time, Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation was closing to the peak of the 2nd rank of the martial path.\u201cJust a bit longer and I can reach the peak of the 2nd rank\u2026\u2026 then the 3rd rank won\u2019t be far away either.\u201dZhao Feng was full of expectations.The next day, Zhao Feng left home and headed towards the martial arts library.This was because \u201cLightly Floating Ferry\u201d and \u201cContinuous Meteorite Arrows\u201d needed open space to practise.\u2026\u2026.Soon, Zhao Feng arrived in a corner of the martial arts field.This was a place where they practised with bows and arrows.Shoosh!An arrow left an afterimage in the air, and shot straight into the centre of the target 50 meters away.\u201cGreat arrow skill! It is no wonder that Brother Zhao Yui is one of the sect\u2019s top 3 godly archers\u201d\u201cThis arrow could probably break straight through the defence of a 3rd rank, and even kill muscular wild beasts.\u201dExcited shouting came from the side.\u201cFormidable!\u201dZhao Feng just came in time and exclaimed.He knew that the youth who was called \u201cZhao Yui\u201d was famous for being a godly archer in the sect.Shoosh shoosh shoosh \u2026\u2026\u2026Zhao Yui pulled the string and shot out 5-6 arrows at lightning speed, which formed a ring around the centre\u2019s red dot.\u201cGood! Great!\u201dThe disciples around started cheering.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t pay any more attention because he felt that if he tried, he could also become a godly archer.He went to an open space and picked up a random bow. He then squinted his eyes, as if he was aiming.As soon as he picked up the bow the disciples around the field focused on him.\u201cLook\u2026. Who\u2019s that? He looks new.\u201dA disciple saw him and his eyes shone.\u201cHeh heh, this kid is called Zhao Feng and he came from a branch sect half a year ago. Not long ago, I heard that he offended Zhao Yijian who is ranked 3rd amongst the outer disciples. I also heard that his girl even left him now\u2026..There were some though who recognised Zhao Feng.\u201cBranch family disciple? Let us take a bet and see how many rings he can hit.\u201dA few disciples looked mockingly at Zhao Feng.Even the goldly archer \u201cZhao Yui\u201d was disturbed by this.\u201cArrow skills needs talent and integrity. It is not something anyone who wants to learn it can learn.\u201dZhao Yui was arrogant and faintly looked at Zhao Feng.Zhao Feng did not bother with these people.He barely used his left eye and the target 50 metres away in his vision became bigger and bigger\u2026..Shoosh\u2014The arrow string trembled and the arrow flew through the air, barely landing on the target but then fell off onto the ground.If floated\u2026..Zhao Feng started sweating as this was his first time using a bow.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dThe disciples around the field raised their heads and laughed.Again.Zhao Feng was calm. Missing on the first arrow was normal.Next, he used more energy on his left arrow and merged the Continuous Meteorite Arrow skill into his heart.Shoosh\u2014The second arrow went straight to the target and was one ring away from the middle.9th Ring!The field turned silent.Those that were laughing had their faces freeze.Even Zhao Yui\u2019s eyebrows pushed together.9th Ring, this was already very close to the centre.To shoot 50 metres away and hit this was even good for some old archers.\u201cLuck! This must be luck!\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re right! A beginner cannot shoot this accurately. His first arrow did not even hit the target.\u201dThe disciples started laughing again and looked at Zhao Feng.However, just before they finished their words the 3rd arrow shot through the air.Shooosh\u2014The arrow shot out like lighting and hit the target.Ta!Dead centre!The field turned silent once more.Even Zhao Yui was shocked. They all had faces of confusion and stood there frozen.\u201cMy luck is not bad.\u201dZhao Feng gave a little smileHis lips curled once again into a smile as it was proven that he had an exceptional talent for the bow.\u201cLuck? What\u2019s up with this guy?\u201dMost of the archers had queer faces on.Any archer was a beginner from the start. However, it was their first time seeing someone with such luck.\u201cKid! Take another shot!\u201dA few disciples said unwillingly.\u201cYes! Take another shot!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMost of them had excited looks on and started shouting.Zhao Feng wanted to leave, but these people were unwilling to let him leave.There were a few disciples that were the 3rd rank of the martial path, and most here were older than him.\u201cFine.\u201dZhao Feng shrugged his shoulders and then picked up the bow again.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If he hits the centre this time, I will write my name backwards.\u201dThe archers on the field had excited faces and looked down upon Zhao Feng.The person in the crowd who had the highest skill was Zhao Yui. He had a face full of confidence, \u201cArchery skills are only improved by shooting infinite times. Only then will you become a peak archer.\u201dHis words made those archers around nod in agreement.Zhao Feng squinted his eyes, but did not use his left eye this time.If he used his left eye, it would obviously hit dead centre.Zhao Feng decided to go low key, so he just barely used his left eye.At the same time, the Continuous Meteorite Arrows skill in his mind merged into his heart and became a part of him.Every part of Zhao Feng\u2019s body, even his breathing, started to have a small change.These changes weren\u2019t watched closely by the people.However, being an exceptional archer, Zhao Yui\u2019s eyes flashed.Shoosh-The bow shot out an arrow that whipped through the air, and like a meteorite, landed on the target.Dead Centre!\u201cAnother 10th ring!\u201dZhao Feng had a wronged expression.This time he didn\u2019t even fully use his left eye, but only the skills of Continuous Meteorite ArrowsHe thought that it was hard to get a good result, but did not know that he would still hit dead centre.Ah!He shook his head and sighed.His actions made the disciples face\u2019s go tense.\u201cAnother dead centre, what is this guy!?\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s got two dead centres now, how can someone be so lucky?\u201dThese archers had confused expressions and were unwilling to believe.\u201cOk, I have finished shooting, I am going to go now.\u201dZhao Feng patted his clothes, then put down his bow and got ready to leave.Looking at his back, all the archers around felt angry.\u201cKid! Stop right there!\u201dA cold voice came from behind.Zhao Feng stopped his footsteps and turned around.The person who called him was Zhao Yui.Zhao Yui had a face full of anger and his 3rd rank of the martial path made the people around him feel pressure.Zhao Yui was 17-18 years old. The fact that he had higher cultivation (3rd rank) and was also bigger in size than Zhao Feng added some ferocity.\u201cI have already shot my arrow, what else do you want me to do?\u201dAlthough Zhao Yui was strong, and Zhao Feng didn\u2019t have any confidence in winning. However, it did not mean he was scared of him.\u201cYou are still acting!\u201d Zhao Feng snorted: \u201cYou are not a beginner, you are just here to play us!\u201dAfter this was said, the archers around him all came to a realisation and nodded in agreement.\u201cNo wonder this kid had so much luck, he was just a tiger pretending to be a pig!\u201d\u201cHmph, this guy dares to play us!\u201dThe disciples around believed Zhao Yui\u2019s words and started shouting at Zhao Feng with angry faces.\u201cCalm down everyone, this was indeed my first time shooting.\u201dZhao Feng shook his head; he really wasn\u2019t a tiger pretending to be a pig.To get such a good result was not something that he expected.Zhao Yui stared at him and twinkled his eyes: \u201cEven I got tricked by the first two arrows. However, the 3rd arrow\u2026. Your hand stance has obviously reached a high level. To shoot 50 metres and hit the centre twice in a row. What kind of beginner has this kind of luck?\u201dHe had reason for his words. It did not matter if Zhao Feng had one hundred mouths, because he still wouldn\u2019t be able to explain.\u201cWhat do you guys want?\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s face turned cold, if he could not explain then there was no point in explaining.\u201cHeheh kiddo, you have the nerve to play us. So we\u2019re not gonna let you leave so easily.\u201dThe disciples around all touched their fists and more and more people came crowding over.\u2026..\u201cSister Yufei, that place seems popular, let us go over and see.\u201dSome of the sect\u2019s girls\u2019 were attracted by the attention given.These girls\u2019 ages were between 12 and 16.One of them wore a purple dress. She had a face as white as snow and seemed fragile, but her beauty was incomparable.\u201cToo beautiful\u2026. Who is she?\u201dOne youth the same age as Zhao Feng stood dazzled and his eyes locked on to the girl.\u201cThat\u2019s the sect new genius \u201cZhao Yufei\u201d!\u201dMost of the sect\u2019s disciples knew the girl\u2019s identity.\u201cShe is only fourteen-fifteen years old and she is already at the peak of the 3rd rank of the martial path. She will be at the 4th rank soon and will then become a true martial artist.\u201d\u201cThis Zhao Yufei is not only pretty, but she also has exceptional talent.\u201dSome youths took back their eyesight and felt ashamed, as if they felt like they were not worthy of Zhao Yufei.Zhao Yufei wasn\u2019t only pretty, but also had a refreshing aura. She was like a flower.Even Zhao Yui\u2019s eye shone when he saw Zhao Yufei.\u201cIt\u2019s her\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Feng also knew Zhao Yufei.Zhao Yufei was also a branch disciple that came over half a year ago.She had the same cultivation as Zhao Yijian, but she was younger!It was hard to believe that someone from the branch family, under the resources she had, could achieve such a realm.Maybe, this was a genius!Some things couldn\u2019t happen to normal people. For a genius however, they could with ease.When Zhao Feng previously saw Zhao Yufei, he thought that she was beautiful. Being a normal youth of the same age, it was hard not to be attracted. However, at that time, Zhao Feng knew that with his cultivation and status, he and Zhao Yu Fei were 2 people from different worlds.Seeing Zhao Yufei come over, Zhao Yui went over to warmly greet her.Zhao Feng was composed, and looked straight at Zhao Yufei.If it was before, and Zhao Feng was in front of this beautiful girl genius, he would think of himself as unworthy and would even be scared to look her in the eye.Today however, he looked straight at her.When he looked at her, Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye subconsciously started to move.Through his left eye, Zhao Yufei\u2019s stunning figure was even clearer than before.Yi!Through this, Zhao Feng was shocked.Slowly, Zhao Yufei\u2019s clothes started to fade and he almost saw the snow white skin inside\u2026.Obviously, his left eye did not have see-through abilities. Even if it did, it would be incredibly weak.It was only because he had super-vision that he could see things more clearly.The difference was that normal people\u2019s vision stayed on something far away, whereas Zhao Feng\u2019s vision could pull it closer and look at it under \u201czero distance\u201d. That is why there was a certain 'see-through\u201d effect.At this time, Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye was pushed to its full capabilities and inside the pitch black dimension, the faint green glow spun faster.Suddenly, Zhao Yu Fei\u2019s clothes completely disappeared, even her body was almost fully see-through.Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye saw her blood circulating, he even saw the faint purple aura inside her veins.\u201cZhao Yufei\u2019s talent is so strong! She is going to have \u201cMartial Path Inner Strength\u201d soon\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Feng was very surprised by this and took a long breath.In terms of age, she was only older than him by a year, but she had already had achievements of some height. At the Azure Flower Continent, most of the \u201cMartial Learners\u201d stayed in the 3rd rank of the martial path forever as they were unable to understand \u201cMartial Path Inner Strength\u201d and become 4th rankers.Zhao Yufei however, at the age of 14-15 had almost completely understood the concept of \u201cMartial Path Inner Strength\u201d. The days until she becomes a true martial artist were not far away.\u201cMy left eye does not have a fully see-through ability, but I can still sense the blood and inner strength of those I look at.\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s eye jumped and this was the conclusion he gave after some thought.At this time, the key focus, Zhao Yufei seemed to feel something and looked towards Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng did not hide but closed the ability of his left eye.Zhao Yu Fei felt weird inside her heart as she a feeling of being stripped and having all her secrets seen.\u201cWhat happened here?\u201dZhao Yufei took back her gaze and asked.\u201cLittle sister Yu Fei, this is what happened\u2026..\u201dZhao Yui and the others exaggerated the whole incident.\u201cI see.\u201dZhao Yufei looked at Zhao Feng.Zhao Feng knew that under these conditions he would not be able to explain.\u201cKid! Because of your past actions, you have caused a crowd outrage. I will give you a chance to apologise to everyone.\u201dZhao Yui said arrogantly.Apologise?\u201cI did not do anything wrong so why would I need to apologise?\u201dZhao Feng clicked his tongue.\u201cIf you apologise to us, then we will let this pass.\u201dZhao Yui said like a gentlemen.He was obviously going to perform well in front of this beauty.\u201cApologise? Not possible.\u201d Zhao Feng said: \u201cEverything you said before was just what you thought yourselves.\u201dWhen he said this, everyone, even including Zhao Yu Fei, pushed their eyebrows together.\u201cThis Zhao Feng is a bit too arrogant.\u201dZhao Yufei now had a bad impression of Zhao Feng.\u201cYou can argue well can\u2019t you?\u201dZhao Yui laughed instead of getting angry.\u201cIf you do not apologise, then do not think that you will be able to leave.\u201dThe disciples around started to close in on Zhao Feng.\u201cUsing more to fight less?\u201dZhao Feng had a face of mockery and glanced at Zhao Yufei.Zhao Yui and his cronies all had their faces change.In front of this genius and beautiful girl, they would obviously act as gentlemen, and using more to beat up less was not very good looking.\u201cFine!\u201dZhao Yui\u2019s eyes twirled and had a trick up his heart: \u201cWe won\u2019t use more to beat less\u2026. You won\u2019t need to apologise, but only if you can beat me in arrow skills.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right! Since you are both archers, use your strength to talk.\u201d\u201cLittle sister Yufei can be the judge.\u201dEveryone agreed and started shouting.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Yui laughed in his heart, this was like shooting 2 birds with 1 arrow.Through an arrow contest, he could make Zhao Feng apologise and not lose demeanour.He could also show off his skills in front of Zhao Yufei, maybe even win her heart!\u201cArchery skills contest?\u201dZhao Feng felt it was helpless to say anymore, \u201cFine, we talk with our strengths.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And due to gravity, they will fall on their targets\u2026..\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s left eye recorded the routes perfectly.The end result made his heart shook.Continuous Eagle Arrows!It took a long time before everyone finally calmed down.\u201cWhat high level of archery skill!\u201dZhao Yufei\u2019s eyes showed some shock.\u201cThanks for watching.\u201dZhao Yui saw Zhao Yufei\u2019s reaction and laughed to himself.\u201cKid! It is your turn!\u201dAfter Zhao Yui finished, all of their gazes turned towards Zhao Feng with eyes full of mockery.No one believed that Zhao Feng\u2019s archery skill would compare to Zhao Yui\u2019s.\u201cHmmm\u2026. Let me think a bit\u2026.\u201dZhao Feng picked up a bow and in his mind, Continuous Meteorite Arrows once again merged with his heart.He analysed that for him to beat Zhao Yui was impossible, unless he had an extra few days of time.So he couldn\u2019t use normal ways to beat Zhao Yui.Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes scanned across the skies and then over the archery field as he decided on what he was going to do.\u201cOk, I am going to start now.\u201dZhao Feng slowly took out an arrow.\u201cThe first arrow.\u201dHe pulled back an arrow and shot carelessly into the sky.What is this guy doing\u2026\u2026Everyone paused.However, just at this time, a sound came from the sky.Peh!A black shadow dropped from the sky.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned wide because it was an eagle.\u201cThis kid\u2019s archery skills aren\u2019t bad since he can shoot down the birds from the sky so easily.\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026. Just little tricks.\u201dZhao Yui had a face of disdain.Indeed, although Zhao Feng did good, it was nothing compared to his \u201cContinuous Eagle Arrows\u201d.Peng! Peng!Zhao Feng shot out 2 more arrows\u2026..Every arrow he shot killed a bird.\u201cKid! Do not show off your crappy skills, just hurry up and admit defeat.\u201dOne archer said impatiently.\u201cHmmm\u2026. My hand feels it is good now.\u201dZhao Feng did not bother with him, because he found the feeling just then.Right after, he took a deep breath, and used all of his power on his left eye.At that moment, his left eye glowed faint green.Shoosh \u2014\u2014Another arrow shot through the skies, fast as lightning.Tah!From the sky dropped another black shadow.Zhao Yui laughed coldly but did not speak.\u201cOh my god! This arrow shot down 2 birds.\u201dAn archer exclaimed.Zhao Yui heard that and looked over. Indeed there were 2 birds there.One arrow, two birds!Zhao Yui\u2019s heart leapt; he never thought that Zhao Feng had such high archery skills.Even Zhao Yui did not have much confidence in this, it depended on luck for him.\u201cThe sparrows body is small and flies super fast. To shoot one arrow and kill both sparrows is on par with Zhao Yui\u2019s \u201cContinuous Eagle Arrows\u201d.\u201dOne archer said.\u201cThis is just an appetiser.\u201dZhao Feng gave a faint smile.The crowd\u2019s heart lept.Could Zhao Feng still have higher skills?Zhao Feng did not explain, but slowly lifted his bow and shot at a target 50 metres away.What does this mean?No one understood what that meant.50 metres was 100 steps.To shoot a target 100 steps away, even the centre, was nowhere near able to be compared with Continuous Eagle Arrows or One arrow, two birds.Shoosh!Zhao Feng\u2019s arrows sliced through the air and landed on the target 50 metres out.Peng!The arrow didn\u2019t even hit the centre; it only hit the outer edges.Zhao Feng wiped his sweat and let out a long breath.\u201cHahaha\u2026. This arrow almost missed the target\u2026\u201dThe disciples all started laughing.Zhao Yui also laughed.Did Zhao Feng accidentally miss?However, when they looked at Zhao Feng, he had a face full of confidence.Being the judge, Zhao Yufei also had a questioning face.She felt that Zhao Feng\u2019s arrow wasn\u2019t as easy as it looked.\u201cYou go over and look.\u201dZhao Feng said full of confidence.The crowd walked over to see the arrow.On the outer edges of a target lay an arrow; it still trembled.Zhao Feng made an archer to pull the arrow.Everyone stared at the arrow.Soon, the arrow head was pulled out.At the arrowhead was a pea-sized dead body with traces of blood\u2026..What is this!\u201cOh my god\u2026. This is a fly! A fly!\u201dOne of the disciples screamed, shocked.What!Many archers eyeballs almost popped out from shock.\u201cOh my god! To have a hundred step difference and kill a fly, how did he do this?\u201d\u201cTo see a fly 100 steps away is already so hard. The fly also flies randomly\u2026.\u201d\u201cHow\u2026. how is this possible!?\u201dZhao Yui\u2019s face turned white and stared at the fly\u2019s body, as if his soul was lost.If he was lucky he would be able to shoot 2 birds with 1 arrow, but to kill a fly from a hundred steps away was impossible for him.The fly was too small. Normal people could not even see the fly from a hundred steps away.The archery contest ended here.The winner was decided.\u201cThe winner of this archery contest is Zhao Feng.\u201dZhao Yufei quickly recovered from the shock and looked complexly at Zhao Feng.This was her first time seriously sizing up Zhao Feng. The youth she saw was confident and had an appeal that surpassed many people of the same age.\u201cI can leave now, no?\u201dZhao Feng walked towards the outside.The crowd automatically opened a path for him.Most people in the archery field learned how to shoot arrows. Zhao Feng\u2019s archery skills subdued them, even Zhao Yui could not say anything.After he walked out of the archery field, Zhao Feng let out a long breath. Today\u2019s archery session benefitted him a lot.As soon as Zhao Feng walked out of the archery field.\u201cHahaha\u2026. Zhao Feng, I finally found you!\u201dA cruel laughter sounded in front of him.As soon as the words finished, three youths blocked Zhao Feng\u2019s way.The youth at the front had thick eyebrows and had a face of success.It was Zhao Kun!\u201cLittle bastard, last time I lost to you. This time however I am going to make you lose and beg for forgiveness.\u201dZhao Kun licked his lips and his eyes had a certain amount of deadliness in them.This time he was going to beat Zhao Feng fair and square, and also humiliate him.Only because he lost to Zhao Feng in one move last time and felt humiliated\u2026..Zhao Feng found that the 2 helpers Zhao Kun brought were both at the 2nd rank of the Martial Path and were there to stop him from escaping.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSister Yufei, that Zhao Feng seems to have some trouble.\u201dOne of the girls at Zhao Yufei\u2019s side said.At this time, most of the people from the archery field found the change that occurred here.Zhao Yui had a gloating expression on his face\u2026..However, in front of these matters, Zhao Feng felt no fear and swiftly said: \u201cMake your move.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It looks like you\u2019ve broken through to the second rank of the Martial Path\u2026. However, if that\u2019s all you\u2019ve got, then you\u2019d better start begging for forgiveness now.\u201dZhao Kun felt a little surprised by Zhao Feng\u2019s 2nd rank of the Martial Path, but it didn\u2019t affect his plans.That was because Zhao Feng had reached the 2nd rank not long ago, and Zhao Kun himself had reached the peak of the 2nd rank a year or two ago.He also had high ranked martial art skills.\u201cPlease stop chattering, my time is limited.\u201dZhao Feng coldly said.\u201cKid! Don\u2019t be arrogant!\u201dZhao Kun suddenly turned his four limbs and body into a weird stance, and like a poisonous snake, bit towards Zhao Feng.In a flash, Zhao Kun\u2019s used his Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake . In terms of speed and power, it far exceeded that of Zhao Feng\u201cZhao Kun has probably already trained the Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake to a low level.\u201dOn the archery field, Zhao Yufei had a moved and slightly shocked face.Being one of the sects\u2019 genius, she obviously had major support from the sect and so, naturally, had access to high rank martial art skills.The higher the rank of a skill was, the harder it was to train in it.Once a high rank skill had been trained to the low level, the power would be stronger than when one trained a middle ranked skill to a high level.\u201cWhat speed! The damage is at least 50% higher than before!\u201dZhao Feng was also surprised by Zhao Kun, but his left eye\u2019s reaction speed could still see the route of Zhao Kun\u2019s move.\u201cAngry Dragon flipping the River!\u201dZhao Feng shouted aloud and stomped both feet downwards. Under the Air Pushing Breathing Technique, he put his power into both of his arms.Zhao Kun suddenly realised that the opponents power was rapidly increased.And then he became more shocked as Zhao Feng put even more power into \u201cAngry Dragon flipping the River\u201d.The 3rd stance of Angry Dragon Fists \u2013 Angry Dragon flipping the Rivers!At that moment, Zhao Feng was like a dragon as his fists punched downwards.Peh!The first punch made Zhao Kun\u2019s body shudder and almost caused him to spit out blood.His Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake was about cunningness and flexibility. It\u2019s forte wasn\u2019t in fighting straight on.Zhao Feng\u2019s fists however felt like they knew where he was going to move and always hit his weak spots.Peh peh peh \u2014\u2014Using Air Pushing Breathing Technique, Zhao Feng had already trained \u201cAngry Dragon flipping the River\u201d to a high degree.\u201cAhhhhh\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201dZhao Kun was hit by the outstanding power and landed on the ground, kneeling. His arms felt numb and blood was leaking from his mouth.\u201cYou\u2019ve lost.\u201dZhao Feng exited the fighting ring.As they fought, Zhao Feng had used his left eye and clearly saw Zhao Kun\u2019s attacking routes. He had also seen some errors in Zhao Kun\u2019s high rank martial art, which meant that it was yet to be perfected.Zhao Feng felt that Angry Dragon Fists and Air Pushing Breathing Technique co-ordinated together to an unimaginable degree, it could already beat some 3rd rank people.\u201cHow is this possible\u2026.. My skill is a high ranked one!\u201dZhao Kun crawled on the ground and screamed.The whole fight only lasted for two breaths.One move!Zhao Kun lost!The disciples in the archery field looked on in shock.Although they had the same rank, to win in one move was too exaggerating, especially when the loser had used a high rank skill.As she sent Zhao Feng away with her eyes, Zhao Yufei murmured: \u201cI knowAngry Dragon Fists, it\u2019s a powerful move within the sect and could be comparable to high ranked skills, but it is very hard to learn. I think he also trains in another skill and use it with Angry Dragon Fists, which allowed the power to almost double.\u201d\u201cSister Yufei, how did Zhao Kun lose when his cultivation and skill were both higher?\u201dA girl next to her asked.\u201cMoves are dead, but people are alive. Zhao Kun\u2019s use of the Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake was extremely bad and he has only learned the first three moves, which is far off from his older brother \u201cZhao Gan\u201d. Also, his battle consciousness is nowhere near that of Zhao Feng\u2019s.\u201d Zhao Yufei then paused for a bit before she said: \u201cAlso, Zhao Feng has learned two skill that are very close to being high ranked ones, and trained them to a very high level. Under the usage of these two skills, his strength exceeded that of Zhao Kun.\u201dAfter the girl listened to Zhao Yu Fei\u2019s analysis, she exclaimed: \u201cZhao Feng is so strong!\u201d\u201cHaha\u2026 apparently Zhao Kun\u2019s brother \u201cZhao Gan\u201d is ranked 5th amongst the outer disciples. We just do not know if he will help his brother take revenge.\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cSo much trouble!\u201dZhao Feng shook his head and left the martial arts field, later on he arrived at an open forest in the sect.He came here to train in the most mysterious footwork skill \u2013 Lightly Floating Ferry.Lightly Floating Ferry was, without a doubt, the skill with the highest rank amongst those he had. The problem was that it was partially ruined and was very hard to learn.\u201cWhen Angry Dragon Fists and Air Pushing Breathing Technique are used together the damage is awesome. I just do not know how Lightly Floating Ferry will be.\u201dZhao Feng was full of expectations.The same day, he started to ponder about Lightly Floating Ferry.When he concentrated, the faint green glow inside his left eye\u2019s pitch black dimension spun faster and faster.Zhao Feng felt that although some of Lightly Floating Ferry\u2019s moves were burned into his mind, which made it easier for him to understand, it was not as simple to learn as Angry Dragon Fists or Air Pushing Breathing Technique.\u201cLightly Floating Ferry is harder to learn than a peak middle ranked skill by at least two to three times\u2026.\u201dThis was the conclusion given after he compared the skills.Although it was hard, it did not stump him.Zhao Feng only used 2-3 days to understand the first \u00bc of of Light Floating Ferry at a beginner standard.He only used 6 days to achieve the \u201cbeginning level\u201d.Normal skills had 4 ranks that depended on how well trained one was in it.These were: Beginner, Low, High and Peak level.Beginner level equaled 30% of the max skillLow level equaled 50%.High level equaled 70%.Peak level equaled 90% or higher.Like Angry Dragon Fists, Zhao Feng easily trained it to High level.Lightly Floating Ferry had also been trained to beginner level in the same amount of time, but it was only the first \u00bc of the skill.Sou!Zhao Feng\u2019s body flashed, his body as light as a bird as he floated 4-5 metres on air.Teng! Teng!His feet pushed off the branches and felt fabulous as he flew.At that moment, Zhao Feng was like a bird that happily flew through the forest.\u201cI have only trained Lightly Floating Ferry to the beginner level, but the speed of it far surpasses most middle ranked skills that have been trained to a high level.\u201dIt could be seen that Lightly Floating Ferry far exceeded most high ranked martial art skills.When there was extra time, Zhao Feng did not forget to slowly decipher the rest of the book. Now he had deciphered one-third of the last \u00be. (Aka, another quarter of it)The only problem was that it took a lot of mental energy to do so.This meant that \u00bd of Lightly Floating Ferry could now be learned.After Lightly Floating Ferry reached a beginner level, Zhao Feng started to train in Angry Dragon Fists and Air Pushing Breathing Technique again.This was because, although Lightly Floating Ferry was a high rank martial art skill, it only helped with his footwork and didn\u2019t increase his cultivation much.After training in a high rank skill such as Lightly Floating Ferry and then going back to training Angry Dragon Fists and Air Pushing Breathing Technique, Zhao Feng felt that it had become easier and smoother.After two days.Air Pushing Breathing Technique had broken through to the 3rd level.Angry Dragon Fists had reached the peak level.At this time, Zhao Feng closed his eyes and felt the power that coursed through his body. His strength was stronger than when he first reached the 2nd rank by more than 50%.Inside his left eye\u2019s dimension, the faint green glow radius had extended from 67cm to 98cm.\u201cIt looks like my cultivation has reached the peak of the 2nd rank. I just need one more step to breakthrough into the third rank.\u201dZhao Feng took a deep breath and controlled his excitement.It had only been half a month since he reached the 2nd rank.This cultivation speed was just too surprising!The thing that made him most surprised was that the Air Pushing Breathing Technique as it reached the 3rd level.Once Air Pushing Breathing Technique reached the peak of the 3rd level there was a chance to understand Martial Path Inner Strength and that was the key point for becoming a true martial artist.Zhao Feng never thought that he would reach the 3rd level of Air Pushing Breathing Technique this fast.This made his strength far surpass the others who were also at the 2nd rank. He could now be compared to a 3rd rank!By only using half a month, Zhao Feng\u2019s strength had doubled.All of this was due to the mysterious eye.Zhao Feng believed that his once normal destiny was changing\u2026..That night, Zhao Feng started to set his life goals.His first goal was to perform well at the family sparring contest one and a half month later.At that time he would fairly and squarely beat Zhao Yijian and spar with the true genius\u2019 of Sun Feather City.\u201cThe change in my left eye allows for me to have a high level of understanding, and the only thing stopping me from becoming a genius in the sect is\u2026\u2026 cultivation resources.\u201dZhao Feng analysed.Since he merged with his left eye, his mental energy and analysis speed had increased. He also became more calm.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe only problem was, how to gain cultivation resources?Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation speed was fast, but it was still hard to break past the peak of the 2nd rank.However, if he had enough resources, this barrier could be easily broken through.\u201cGot it!\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s eyes twinkled and soon he had an idea. His lips curled into a confident smile.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

You\u2019ve got to help me! Zhao Feng made me lose face and he is just a lowly branch disciple!\u201dZhao Kun bit his teeth and said with murderous intent.He had lost twice in a row to a branch disciple, he did not have the face to leave his house.\u201cTrash!\u201dInside the room sat a slim, leopard like, short-haired youth.This was Zhao Kun\u2019s older brother, Zhao Gan.\u201cElder brother, I am begging you. You have got to help me.\u201dZhao Kun was full of fear and hatred.He was afraid of his brother.Ever since he was born, Zhao Gan had bullied him.He felt useless as Zhao Gan was always better than him at everything.Zhao Gan had now reached the peak of the 3rd rank of the Martial Path and had already trained the Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake to the 6th change, which allowed for him to rank top 5 out of the outer sect disciples.Even three or five of Zhao Kun weren\u2019t his brother\u2019s opponent.\u2026\u2026.The morning of the second day.Zhao Feng got out of bed early and started to practice Angry Dragon Fists and Air Pushing Breathing Technique.These two martial art skills were the ones that Zhao Feng mainly trained in.\u201cI still have some way until I reach the 3rd rank of the Martial Path.\u201dZhao Feng practiced for half an hour and acted on yesterday\u2019s \u201cplans\u201d, walking towards the money room of the sect.According to the rules, Zhao Feng could get ten pieces of silver per month.\u201cI haven\u2019t taken this month\u2019s money yet.\u201dZhao Feng soon arrived at the money room.\u201cZhao Feng, second rank of the Martial Path, branch disciple, monthly money of twenty silver.\u201dThe accountant said expressionlessly.Twenty pieces of silver?Zhao Feng took over the money and exchanged his thanks.After reaching the second rank, his monthly allowance had doubled.Although a monthly allowance of twenty silver could let a whole family eat and sleep without worrying, it was nothing for martial artists.Some expensive cultivation resources that could increase one\u2019s cultivation speed and help breakthrough realms easily exceeded thousands of pieces of silver.Any of the resources rich disciples ate casually exceeded thirty years of normal disciples\u2019 allowances.\u201cTwenty pieces of silver\u2026..\u201dZhao Feng took a deep breath and holding his silver, left the Zhao sects territory and headed towards the market of Sun Feather City.He used to give the money he got to his parents to help them out.This time however, he did not do that. Instead he took the silver and left.Soon after, Zhao Feng stepped into Sun Feather\u2019s City\u2019s largest market.A weapon\u2019s shop in the city.\u201cShopkeeper, how much is this \u201cHeavy Metal Bow\u201d?\u201dZhao Feng finally decided after taking a long time.\u201cThis Heavy Metal Bow is extremely powerful. It can shoot up to one hundred and fifty metres. Twenty pieces of silver, no bargaining.\u201dThe shopkeeper said as he smiled.He had seen the \u201cZhao sect\u201d symbol on Zhao Feng\u2019s clothes.At Sun Feather City, the Zhao sect, Qiu sect, and the Xin sect were the three largest families and had total dominance within the city.\u201cTwenty pieces of silver?\u201dZhao Feng crossed his eyebrow and deeply said, \u201cCan it be a little cheaper?\u201dThe shopkeeper smiled faintly: \u201cFine, I will give you the lowest price, eighteen pieces of silver.\u201d\u201cFifteen! I am low on money, but when I get more I will double the money and give it to you.\u201dZhao Feng said with honesty.\u201cFifteen pieces? That\u2019s probably a bit low, there is almost no profit\u2026\u2026\u201dThe shopkeeper seemed to have a little difficulty, but maybe seeing the honesty in Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes, he bit his lips: \u201cFine, hopefully you keep your promise because this shop is also under the Zhao sect\u2019s territory.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201dZhao Feng said gratefully.He never realised that this shop was under the Zhao sect.Soon, Zhao Feng bought the bow at a price of fifteen silver and also bought some arrows and food.Now, Zhao Feng had no money left.\u201cHopefully it won\u2019t fail\u2026.\u201dZhao Feng murmured to himself and soon left Sun Feather City.Teng!As soon as he left Sun Feather City, Zhao Feng used Lightly Floating Ferry to move. His speed was even faster than most normal horses.Two hours later, Zhao Feng finally arrived at his destination, the Sky Cloud Forest.\u201cSky Cloud Forest\u201d was the County of Cloud\u2019s biggest forest. It\u2019s area even spanned across over ten other countries.Being the largest forest of the surrounding countries, \u201cSky Cloud Forest\u201d had many dangerous wild beasts, and near the centre of it there were high level \u201cdeadly beasts\u201d.Deadly beasts were far stronger than wild beasts. They had been affected by spiritual energy, and had therefore slowly changed into powerful beings.A few strong deadly beasts could easily destroy a village. Only true martial artists could fight them.Zhao Feng came to the Sky Cloud Forest, obviously not to try finding deadly beasts as he still wanted to live.His goal was simple, hunting to earn money!Some strong wild beasts inside the Sky Cloud Forest had expensive furs and other materials.E.g, a fully-grown bear could sell for two to three hundred silver.However, a fully-grown bear\u2019s strength far exceed normal second rankers. Only third rankers could win against it.Obviously, Zhao Feng\u2019s target wasn\u2019t a bear or a large sized wild beast.\u201cAlthough large sized wild beasts are worth a lot of money, their mass is too big. I cannot carry many back and forth.\u201dZhao Feng had already made his plans.Teng!His body was like a feather as he used the branches to propel himself forward.Soon, Zhao Feng landed on top of a hundred meter tall tree.This tree was higher than it\u2019s surroundings, giving Zhao Feng dominant vision.If he hadn\u2019t learnt Lightly Floating Ferry then being at this height would make his heart beat rapidly.As he stood on the tree, Zhao Feng used his left eye to survey his surroundings.Shuah!That moment, his left eye went into super-vision mode. Everything within five or six miles was clearly seen by him.Zhao Feng first had to confirm whether there were any dangerous wild or deadly beasts around.Soon Zhao Feng understood the situation within five to six miles.There were twenty beasts that threatened him, and only one of them were close to him. Luckily, there weren\u2019t any deadly beasts.\u201cI am starting now.\u201dZhao Feng took a deep breath then slowly pulled out his heavy metal bow.Shou\u2014\u2013As the bow string trembled, the arrow hit a golden-spotted snake one hundred metres away.Si!The golden-spotted snake jumped up and spat out snake language in a fearsome manner.However, Zhao Feng\u2019s arrow skills were perfect, and directly hit its vitalities.The golden-spotted snake thrashed slightly but soon died.\u201cGolden Striped Snake, super poisonous beasts that can threaten even third rankers.\u201dZhao Feng slightly let out a breath and wiped his sweat.If they were fighting straight on, the golden striped snake had a high chance of kill him as it was extremely fast and poisonous.\u201dHowever, Zhao Feng had also gained a lot.The golden striped snake\u2019s teeth and liver parts were extremely expensive.After killing the \u201cgolden striped snake\u201d, Zhao Feng used his left eye to find new targets.Shou \u2014\u2014\u2014-Suddenly, Zhao Feng heard a screech in mid air.A metal-mouthed eagle, with a wingspan of one meter, easily killed a wolf that was of the second rank.Zhao Feng had a solemn face. The metal-mouthed eagle was called \u201cMetal Pecking Eagle\u201d, and was extremely famous in the Sky Cloud Forest. Its strength easily exceeded that of normal second rankers and flew freely in the air. It almost had no natural enemies.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMetal Pecking Eagles are extremely fast. Its feathers and defense are also strong. It is almost a deadly beast. One would be worth seven to eight hundred pieces of silver.\u201dZhao Feng thought as he used his left eye to target the metal pecking eagle.This time, he took out an arrow coated with poison.Zhi~The heavy metal bow was soon pulled to the max\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This arrow contained the Continuous Meteorite Arrows skill and followed the route set by his left eye.\u201cScreeeeech\u2014\u2014-\u201dAn angry screech was heard coming from the eagle. Zhao Feng then saw the eagle charge towards him, with the arrow still lodged in its stomach.\u201cNot good!\u201dSeeing this, Zhao Feng\u2019s expression changed and he quickly used Lightly Floating Ferry to escape towards the hedges.Although Zhao Feng\u2019s arrow had hit the target, it did not hit any vital parts.The Metal Pecker Eagle\u2019s reaction, flying speed and defense all far surpassed that of normal beasts. It was on par with deadly beasts. So this arrow did not cause any life threatening damage.Teng!Zhao Feng was like an agile bird as he flew through the forest.Nevertheless, his left eye did not forget to lock onto the the eagle.Shou\u2014\u2014-Soon, another arrow was shot out. However, although this arrow hit the eagle in the throat, it did not manage to pierce through its feathers.\u201cThe throat is usually the weakness of normal beasts. From the fact that it did not pierce through, it can be seen that the defense of this eagle is insane.\u201dZhao Feng stalled for a little while and then saw the Metal Pecker Eagle fall towards the ground. This was because the arrows that Zhao Feng had shot contained poison, and now the poison had spread, killing the eagle.Zhao Feng let out a deep breath and revealed happiness on his face. This Metal Pecker Eagle was worth seven to eight hundred silver.Adding in the Golden Striped Snake, Zhao Feng\u2019s wealth now exceeded over a thousand pieces of silver.He had never come across such wealth in his entire life.\u201cHowever, the silver I have is still not enough for me to buy precious resources.\u201dAlthough Zhao Feng was excited, he quickly calmed down.For the next three days, Zhao Feng\u2019s body could be seen travelling around inside the Sky Cloud Forest.Every time Zhao Feng pulled his bow, a scream of pain would soon follow.\u201cFive Poison Centipede, extremely poisonous.

Worth four-hundred silver\u2026\u2026\u201dTo kill as many beasts as possible, Zhao Feng used Lightly Floating Ferry and Continuous Meteorite Arrows to the highest degree possible.Through these efforts, Lightly Floating Ferry had been trained to the low level.His speed probably exceeded all the sects third rankers and was now close to the fourth rankers.Continuous Meteorite Arrows had easily been trained to the peak of the high level.Zhao Feng could not help but think that he was a born archer.If he were to face the Metal Pecker Eagle again, he would only needed one hit to kill it.For the last three days, he had gained a lot. He had killed another two Metal Pecker Eagles, as well as seven to eight other different beasts.\u201cThe beasts I now have are, in total, worth around three to four thousand silver.\u201dZhao Feng had a satisfied expression on his face as he organised his two big bags.On the way back he still used his left eye to hunt prey.This was because his vision was blocked by trees so he could not guarantee that there weren\u2019t any targets that he would miss.Roar\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014At this moment, a powerful roar came from the north side of Sky Cloud Forest. This roar made Zhao Feng ear\u2019s burst with pain.\u201cWhat kind of beast is this? It\u2019s so powerful.\u201dZhao Feng quickly used his left eye and saw that, four or five miles away, there was a five metre long Green Headed Tiger.The Green Headed Tiger was bigger than normal tigers by half its size and gave off a devastating aura. Its roar caused all the animals within a ten kilometre radius to tremble with fear.Five or six youths, who had cultivations between the second and third rank of the Martial Path, were running away in fear.\u201cEveryone run in different directions!\u201dThe leader of the group was a youth who had a scarred face. He seemed to be fifteen or sixteen years of age and had reached the peak of the third rank. He held a long sword that could easily cut a tree in half in order to stall the tiger.Boom!The tiger waved his paws and the tree shattered.\u201cThe strength of deadly beasts is so dangerous.\u201dZhao Feng thought.Once a wild beast entered the ranks of a deadly beast, only martial artists of the fourth rank or higher could fight them.The strength of the tiger king could flatten two or three Zhao Feng\u2019s in one paw.\u201cXin Fei! Watch out!\u201d Some of the youths yelled.The Green Headed Tiger King was heading straight towards the scarred face youth, who had the strongest strength.\u201cThey\u2019re surnamed Xin? Are they disciples of the Xin family, which is also one of the top three families of Sun Feather City?\u201dZhao Feng then saw the symbols on their clothes which confirmed his guess.Boom\u2014\u2014Everywhere the Green Headed Tiger King passed, destruction soon followed, as if nothing could withstand its might.Normal martial learners would probably have died due to fear. Zhao Feng however realised that this \u201cXin Fei\u201d was extremely strong. He had learned a knife throwing skill as well as a footwork skill and they were both high rank martial arts.\u201cThis Xin Fei\u2019s knife can easily slice through trees. His strength is probably double that of normal third rank cultivators. He is probably even stronger than Zhao Yijian.\u201d\u201cQuickly! Save Xin Fei!\u201dTwo other disciples of the Xin family took out their bows and attacked the Green Headed Tiger.However, all their attacks did was stall and disperse the tiger\u2019s concentration.The tiger\u2019s defense was stronger than the Metal Pecker Eagle\u2019s by two or three time, so all the attacks that came from cultivators beneath the fourth rank only felt like a tickle.\u201cIf I can kill this Green Headed Tiger King, it will probably be worth around twenty to thirty thousand silver, which is the worth of around forty beasts.\u201dZhao Feng thought out a dangerous plan.Teng! Teng! \u2026..He immediately used Lightly Floating Ferry and closed in towards the place of the incident. As Zhao Feng arrived, the six disciples of the Xin family were under great pressure.\u201cCracking Wind Sword!\u201dXin Fei eye\u2019s flashed as he used his long sword to stab towards the forehead of the tiger.What a dangerous sword!Zhao Feng saw the entire process of the sword, it power could instantly kill two normal cultivators of the third rank. Not even he would be able to block it.He also felt the faint green aura inside of Xin Fei\u2019s body. This was the sign that Inner Strength would soon be formed.Shuah\u2014\u2014The sword was able to cut half an inch into the Green Headed Tiger\u2019s head, but the forced of it made Xin Fei vomit blood.That sword\u2019s strength came close to the damage dealt by a fourth ranker. It was even able to hurt a deadly beast!Roar\u2014\u2014The Green Headed Tiger howled and then moved towards Xin Fei at an even greater speed.Xin Fei had reached the peak of the third rank and, by using his high rank martial art skill, he dodged the attack.However, his sword attack also used up a lot of energy, almost falling victim to the tiger\u2019s counterattack.\u201cCracking Wind Sword!\u201dCovered with blood, Xin Fei once again used the same move and left another bloody mark on the tiger\u2019s forehead.His body was once again sent flying.Roar!The green headed tiger king opened its jaws and leapt towards Xin Fei. The latter was exhausted and could not dodge.\u201cXin Fei!\u201dThe other disciples screamed, but just at this moment.Sou\u2014\u2013Suddenly, an arrows whipped through the air, straight through the branches and leaves, hitting the tiger.Roar\u2014\u2014\u2013The tiger mournfully howled. At that moment, every living thing trembled.The Xin disciples looked on in a daze as one of its eyes had been shot by an arrow\u2026..Although the defense of the tiger was strong, its eyes were its weakest part.Because the tiger turned around to find the \u201cculprit\u201d Xin Fei was able to escape.However, as it surveyed its surrounding, where was the sign of the culprit?\u201cSo close!\u201dZhao Feng hid behind a towering, ancient tree, which was only one hundred metres away from the tiger.As the tiger was trying to find the culprit, the Xin family disciples started to run.However, since the tiger could not find its target, it started to attack in a more frenzied manner.\u201cAhhhhhh\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dThere was a scream as one of the youths of the second rank was ripped into shreds. This view made Zhao Feng, who wasn\u2019t far away, feel cold.Just as another of the Xin family disciples were in danger..Sou\u2014\u2014\u2014-Another arrow came flying through the air, piercing towards the tiger\u2019s other eye.Roar!The tiger roared and then closed its eyes, the arrow was barely able to scratch its eyelids.\u201cAi\u2026\u201dZhao Feng sighed as he shook his head.It wasn\u2019t that his archery skills weren\u2019t high enough, it was because the tiger was on guard, making it hard for the same trick to succeed again.\u201cCracking Wind Sword!\u201dUsing the short time gap, Xin Fei quickly powered another sword attack and hit the same spot as before.\u201cGood chance.\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s eyes flashed as he drew more arrows and fired them. Every time he shot an arrow, it would hit the injury on the tiger\u2019s forehead.Eventually, the tiger\u2019s attack rate slowed down. Firstly, it was because it was severely injured. Secondly, there was poison in the arrows.At this point, the tiger turned and ran towards the deep sections of Sky Cloud Forest.\u201cFollow!\u201dThe Xin disciples bit their teeth and vowed to kill the tiger in order to avenge their peers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAlthough the tiger was severely injured, its speed was not something that cultivators of the second and third rank could catch up to.Only Xin Fei was barely able to catch up, but as he was exhausted he did not have much spare energy.\u201cHahaha! What a good chance\u2026\u2026. Where are you going to run?\u201dZhao Feng laughed as he used Lightly Floating Ferry to easily catch up to the tiger.In his eyes, the tiger represented an enormous wealth of twenty to thirty thousand silver\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That person seems to be one of the Zhao family disciples!\u201dThe other Xin disciples looked at Zhao Feng who was following the tiger. Xin Fei looked at Zhao Feng\u2019s back and murmured, \u201cWhat a high level of footwork! His speed is not even slower than mine when I go full out! His archery skills are not bad either\u2026\u2026\u201d\u201cHmph! He\u2019s just a guy who fires cold arrows! He better not let us catch up, or else\u2026\u2026\u201dA youth, who was at the third rank, coldly said. This youth\u2019s strength was placed after Xin Fei\u2019s.His words were immediately agreed upon by the others, \u201cYou are right! That kid let us be the bait and fired his own arrows while hiding!\u201d\u201cXin Gang, that person saved our lives.\u201dXin Fei shook his head.Just at this moment, a few miles out, the last roar of the \u201cGreen Headed Tigers\u201d sounded\u2026..The expressions of the Xin family disciples changed. Without even thinking about it, they knew that the tiger must have died.\u201cQuick!\u201dThe youth named Xin Gang charged towards the direction of the sound.At the same time, three or four miles out in the east direction.Hu!Zhao Feng leaned against a tree and breathed heavily. Downwards, the five metre long tiger had a few arrows stuck in its forehead. Not long ago, the tiger was a ferocious being. Now however, it had no life left\u2026..Zhao Feng on instinct tried to take out another arrow but then realised that there were none left.Teng!Zhao Feng floated towards the corpse and went into deep thought.Shua!His left eye locked in on the Xin disciples who were two miles out. Zhao Feng stood still and did not move to touch the corpse. It wasn\u2019t that he did not want to, it was just a bit hard for him to do so.The tiger\u2019s body weighed around three tons and was hard to move. Also, the tiger king\u2019s skin was tough to cut.Soon the five Xin disciples arrived.\u201cKid! Move quickly! This is ours!\u201dXin Gang, who was at the front, arrogantly said.He was wary of Zhao Feng\u2019s strength at first, but when he saw that Zhao Feng was only a second ranker, he obviously didn\u2019t put Zhao Feng in his eyes anymore.Although they had lost one person, and Xin Fei was exhausted, they still had two people of the second rank and two more of the third.Zhao Feng stood his ground and mockingly looked at Xin Gang.He was only wary of Xin Fei.\u201cXin Gang! He saved our lives! We can discuss how to split the tiger.\u201dXin Fei said slowly as he arrived.Zhao Feng looked at him praisingly, \u201cJust as I thought. The tigers corpse is this big, and I do not have to tools to cut it, nor the strength to carry it away.\u201dXin Fei had put a lot of power into killing this tiger. They had also lost one person. Although Xin Gang was somewhat unwilling, he still agreed. Soon they started discussing how to split the tiger.\u201cTwo-eight. The Xin family will take eight.\u201dXin Gang said with an iron tone.\u201cHmph! Twenty percent is already too much for this kid!\u201dThe rest of the Xin family all had faces full of disdain.\u201cTwo-eight? Hahaha\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Feng laughed immediately.\u201cKid! What are you laughing about? I want to hear how much you want to take!\u201d\u201cTwo-eight. I get eight\u2026.. You get two!\u201dZhao Feng said. At first he wanted to split it five-five, but he did not think that the Xin family would have such an attitude.\u201cDon\u2019t be arrogant! I\u2019ll see how strong you are!\u201dXin Gang laughed and pulled out his sword.\u201cStop!\u201dXin Fei tried to stop him but it was too late.\u201cIllusion Wind After-Image!\u201dXin Fei was like a wind that whirled towards Zhao Feng.\u201cIt is the high rank martial art Broken Wind Sword!\u201d\u201cThat kid is dead now. Xin Gang had already trained the first six moves of Broken Wind Sword to the low level.\u201dThe Xin disciples had sympathetic expressions.\u201cSmall tricks!\u201dZhao Feng didn\u2019t retreat but instead moved forward.What speed!Everyone, including Xin Fei, only saw Zhao Feng turn into a blur.Not good!Xin Gang\u2019s Illusion Wind After-Image missed and Zhao Feng was closing in on him at an insane speed.\u201cAngry Wind After-Image!\u201dXin Gang shouted as he used another attack.\u201cAngry Dragon Breaking the Sky!\u201dZhao Feng put all of his strength into his fists. The moment he merged Angry Dragon Fists and Air Pushing Breathing Technique together, his power increased by more than double.\u201cWhat strength!\u201dXin Gang felt as if a volcano was erupting. Zhao Feng\u2019s strength almost surpassed the strength of third rankers.Peh!A loud explosion sounded as Xin Gang and Zhao Feng clashed.Wah!Xin Gang spit blood as he was hit by the first punch.The second punch.Bang!His silver sword was knocked flying.The third punch.Boom\u2014\u2014\u2014His whole body flew out and left an imprint of him on a tree.What power!So strong!The other Xin disciples stood there dazed. They never thought that someone who had the power of the peak of the third rank would lose in one move to a second rank Zhao sect disciple.\u201cStrong.\u201dXin Fei, who wasn\u2019t far away, asked, \u201cMay I know your name?\u201d\u201cZhao Feng.\u201dZhao Feng casually took back his fists.\u201cKid! You were just lucky this time!\u201dXin Gang crawled up from the ground, \u201cI\u2019ve been fighting the tiger and am exhausted. Next time you won\u2019t have such luck.\u201d\u201cLuck?\u201dZhao Feng gave off a faint smile. Although Xin Gang was injured, Zhao Feng believed that he could still beat him at his peak. The only one he was wary of was Xin Fei.Xin Fei\u2019s strength had almost reached the fourth rank. When he used all of his strength it could even damage the Green Headed Tiger King, not to mention third rankers.\u201cXin Gang! You are not his opponent! Do you not think that you have already lost enough face?\u201dXin Fei slowly turned towards Zhao Feng. Suddenly, his body gave off a frightening fighting will. Zhao Feng\u2019s heart jumped, \u201cDid Xin Fei already recover?\u201dOf course, if Xin Fei did not have sixty-percent of his strength, then Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t afraid of him. After being in such a state, it was obvious that Xin Fei had yet to fully recovered.\u201cYour fist skill has almost reached the peak level and your footwork is incredible. Next time I would like to spar with you.\u201dXin Fei faced Zhao Feng in the eye full of praise.\u201cSure, we will spar next time.\u201dAlthough Zhao Feng was wary of him, it did not mean that he was scared. Xin Fei\u2019s strength was at least on par with Zhao Yijian, who was ranked third amongst the outer disciples.If Zhao Feng could beat Zhao Yijian, then he would have the ability to fight Xin Fei.Soon they finished discussing how to split their rewards.\u201cSix-four. Me six, you guys four.\u201dZhao Feng said.\u201cOk.\u201dXin Fei was the one that answered as the other Xin disciples did not have the courage to respond. They were wary of Zhao Feng\u2019s strength.Zhao Feng nodded to himself, giving 40% away was like shooting two birds with one arrow. Firstly, he did not have any tool to cut or move the corpse, so he just let the others do the work. Secondly, he did not want to make that many enemies before he had enough strength.Imagine if he took it all of it for himself. Would that not cause the eyes of the others to go red?The tiger was dissected one hour later.Zhao Feng took the most expensive parts and left all of the meat to the Xin disciples. After confirming that he took sixty percent he casually left.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHmmm\u2026.. The Zhao sect seems to have a new genius. Even Zhao Linlong wasn\u2019t as strong as him at the same level of cultivation.\u201d Xin Fei said as his eyes followed Zhao Feng.\u201cZhao Linlong!\u201dXin Gang had an expression of awe, \u201cHe is one of the four genius\u2019 of Sun Feather City! He already reached the fourth rank two years ago and became a true martial artist! How can this kid be compared to him?\u201dThe four great genius\u2019 were the top youths of Sun Feather City.

Worth a total of three hundred and fifty nine silver.\u201d\u201cGold-spotted Snake\u2026\u2026 Worth four hundred and twenty silver.\u201d\u201cFive Poison Centipede\u2026.. Worth two hundred and ten silver.\u201dThe shopkeeper expressionlessly said as he calculated the prices.\u201cMetal Pecker Eagle\u2026. Yi!\u201dSpeaking up to here, the face of the shopkeeper changed. The Metal Pecker Eagle was a beast that had almost entered the ranks of deadly beasts. It defense was strong and it was hard to catch. Even some cultivators of the fourth rank could not catch them.Due to this, the price of Metal Pecker Eagles exceeded that of other beasts of the same rank.\u201cMetal Pecker Eagle\u2026.. Three of them\u2026.. Worth one thousand one hundred silver.\u201d The shopkeeper said after pausing for a second.One thousand one hundred silver? Zhao Feng was a little shocked as the eagle was worth more than he thought. Soon, apart from Zhao Feng\u2019s Green Headed Tiger King, the rest was totaled up.\u201cA total of five thousand eight hundred and fifty silver!\u201d The shopkeeper said.Five thousand eight hundred and fifty silver! Zhao Feng\u2019s heart sped up. His monthly allowance was only twenty silver! He never had a time when he carried more than one hundred silver on him.Even then, the most expensive materials, that of the Green Headed Tiger King, had yet to be added in.\u201cHow about this, I will give you a total of five thousand nine hundred silver.\u201d The shopkeeper had a cunning face.\u201cSure.\u201d Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t be bothered to talk so he agreed.Soon Zhao Feng received his money, all in silver notes.\u201cOh yea, do you guys take parts from deadly beasts?\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t leave immediately after exchanging.\u201cCould it be that you have deadly beast parts?\u201d The shopkeeper\u2019s eyes floated towards the last bag in Zhao Feng\u2019s hands.\u201cYep.\u201d Zhao Feng slowly opened his bag, showing the parts of the Green Headed Tiger King.Immediately a powerful aura came from the bag.\u201cGreen Headed Tiger King!\u201d The shopkeeper exclaimed as he looked disbelievingly at Zhao Feng.He couldn\u2019t imagine how a measly second ranker was able to kill a deadly beast. It was known that a deadly beast could fight against true martial artists. There were even rumours of deadly beasts destroying whole villages.\u201cWe had a total of seven people. It took us a while to kill it and even then we lost someone.\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s words seemed to comfort the shocked shopkeeper.Facing the materials, the shopkeeper\u2019s eyesight looked at the \u201cZhao\u201d symbol on Zhao Feng\u2019s clothes and finally gave a price, \u201cSixteen thousand silver!\u201dAs he gave the price, the workers in the shop took a cold breath. It was their first time hearing such a high price.The shopkeeper did not dare to trick Zhao Feng as he came from the Zhao sect.The Zhao, Xin, and Qiu families were the three biggest powers in Sun Feather City. No shop could open up without their permission.\u201cDeal!\u201d Zhao Feng smiled. He seemed calm but was laughing inside.Soon Zhao Feng took his twenty thousand silver and left the shop.\u201cI can now go buy some resources to help me break through to the third rank.\u201d Zhao Feng headed towards the weapons shop that he went to a few days ago.\u201cKid, you\u2019re here again?\u201d A few days ago Zhao Feng was low on money and technically half borrowed and half paid for the heavy metal bow.Pah!Zhao Feng put his hand on the table: \u201cHere\u2019s one hundred silver. Thank you for your help that day.\u201dOne hundred silver? The shopkeeper was surprised as he never thought that Zhao Feng would be so honest. Zhao Feng had said he would pay back double, but this was over ten times the amount!The shopkeeper smiled as he took the silver. Although he was the shopkeeper, he did not own the shop. One hundred silver was half his year\u2019s income.After paying back the money Zhao Feng didn\u2019t leave but looked around more.\u201cMy heavy metal bow\u2019s strength is too low.\u201d Zhao Feng wanted a new bow. He used his left eye to inspect the weapons on the wall. Soon his eyes stopped on a silver longbow.The silver long bow gave off a cold aura while also giving off a deep calm feeling.\u201cHow much is it for this bow?\u201d Zhao Feng asked.\u201cYou have good eyes! This bow is called \u201cMysterious Silver Bow\u201d and is one of the shops most powerful weapons. Only true martial artists that are proficient in archery can use it to its fullest potential\u2026\u2026 Its price is one thousand and eighty silver.\u201d He did not think that Zhao Feng could afford it but still acted politely.\u201cOne thousand and eighty silver? That\u2019s not very expensive. I will buy it.\u201d Zhao Feng said.The Mysterious Silver bow was made out of great materials and was better than his heavy metal bow by at least a few times. It also needed martial artists of the fourth rank or higher to use it to its fullest potential.\u201cAre you sure you want it\u2026\u2026..? Not borrow it?\u201dPah!Zhao Feng stacked up a heap of silver and pushed it towards the shopkeeper, \u201cQuick, I do not have much time.\u201dWhat?The shopkeeper never thought that Zhao Feng was so \u201crich\u201d\u2026. A few days ago he had only bought a bow worth fifteen silver\u2026..\u201cSure, sure!\u201d The shopkeeper nodded as he took down the bow down and put it in a beautifully carved box. Zhao Feng also bought one hundred arrows that were worth three silver each.After exiting the weapons shop, Zhao Feng went to the City\u2019s biggest medicine shop.\u201cThe medicine pavilion is this City\u2019s largest medicine shop. The owner is very mysterious and it has chain stores in the thirteen countries around here. Even the three big families of Sun Feather City are afraid of its strength.\u201dAs soon as he came to the store he heard a familiar guy\u2019s voice.Yi!Zhao Feng found a male and female not far away. The one speaking was a youth clothed in purple who gave off a frightening aura.\u201cIt\u2019s them\u2026\u2026.\u201d Zhao Feng sighed.The male and female duo was Zhao Yijian and Zhao Xue.\u201cBrother Feng.\u201dZhao Xue said surprisingly as she saw Zhao Feng .Zhao Feng nodded his head as a response and then walked into the Medicine Pavilion.\u201cHmph, just him? He has the right to enter the medicine pavilion? Any item from the medicine pavilion is worth a few years of his income.\u201d Zhao Yijian said disdainfully as he looked at Zhao Feng.Although Zhao Xue did not speak, she knew that with Zhao Feng\u2019s background it would be very hard to take out a few hundred silver.Compared to Zhao Yijian, whose father and grandfather were both cultivators higher than the fourth rank held middle-high positions in the sect, their wealths were not comparable.Ignoring the two, Zhao Feng walked into the Medicine Pavilion and started to search for resources that would help his cultivation increase.\u201cThird rank of the Martial Path\u2026\u2026\u2026 is when the body becomes stronger. In this direction, the blood plant use is incredibly good. It can consolidate one\u2019s foundation and even help some cultivators understand Inner strength\u2026..\u201dZhao Feng thought about it and then confirmed his needs.Out of all the plants, the blood plant was of the biggest use for martial learners.Blood plants were split into many categories. The ones that were older had better use, but were also more expensive.\u201cOne hundred year old blood plant, five hundred silver. Two hundred year old blood plant, one thousand two hundred silver. Three hundred year old blood plant\u2026. Three thousand silver\u2026.. Five hundred year old blood plant\u2026\u2026 ten thousand silver.\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s eyes scanned through the price list.Obviously, the older it was the better it was. Of course, the limits of martial learners were blood plants that were five hundred years old.\u201cBrother Yijian, if I had a two hundred year old blood plant, I might be able to reach the peak of the second rank in half a year.\u201d Zhao Xue\u2019s voice came wandering through.\u201cThat is not possible. At most I can only buy you a one hundred year old one. I have been trying to learn Inner Strength and need expensive materials to help me.\u201d Zhao Yijian said. Although he was rich, he could not spend his money recklessly.\u201cA one hundred year old one is ok as well.\u201d Zhao Xue smiled faintly.Just at this moment, a voice expressionlessly said, \u201cShopkeeper, give me two two-hundred year old blood plants and a three hundred year old one.\u201dThis voice gained the attention of many people.It\u2019s him!Zhao Xue saw Zhao Feng who was not far away and her heart leapt.\u201cA three hundred year old blood plant? He is probably boasting.\u201d Zhao Yijian gave a cold laugh. He would not believe that a normal branch disciple could afford a three hundred year old blood plant.\u201cTwo two-hundred year old blood plant and a three-hundred year old blood plant. A total of five thousand four hundred silver.\u201d The shopkeeper gave his price.Soon, in front of their eyes, Zhao Feng took out his silver and successfully exchanged it with the shopkeeper.This scene made Zhao Yijian\u2019s smile freeze.\u201cHow\u2026. how is this possible?\u201d Zhao Xue had an disbelieving, dazed look.\u201cShopkeeper, can I also get three bottles of high level healing pills as well as three bottles of high level blood recovery pills?\u201dZhao Feng bought some other medicine which were all high level and spent another thousand silver.After the exchange, Zhao Feng waved at Zhao Xue and left in a cool manner. When replying, Zhao Xue had a forced smile and did not look Zhao Feng in the eye\u2026.After leaving the Medicine Pavilion, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t return to the Zhao sect. Instead he went to an inn.He first calculated the silver he had left, it was a total of twelve thousand silver.\u201cI will leave this silver for later use.\u201d Zhao Feng understood that a cultivators path needed a huge amount of resources.That night, he closed his eyes and slowly used the Air Pushing Breathing Technique.Inside of his left eye, the faint green glow had increased from two feet to two feet-five.Zhao Feng confirmed that he had reached the peak of the second rank and just needed half a step more to reach the third rank.\u201cI wonder how strong this medicine will be.\u201dZhao Feng was full of expectations as he ate a blood plant that was two hundred years old.Soon, Zhao Feng felt an enormous amount of strength appear in his body that was chaotic.\u201cWhat a strong herb!\u201dZhao Feng fully used the Air Pushing Breathing Technique and absorbed the medicine.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMaybe it was because Zhao Feng had never used such precious herbs before that he thought that it was extremely strong.In the morning of the second day.\u201cCould this be\u2026.\u201d Zhao Feng felt himself burst with energy. All of his muscles and bones were full of power.Peh!He casually waved his fist and hit out with a force of seven hundred kilograms!

He first thought that, with the help of the two hundred year blood plant, it would still take him at least two days to break through.Zhao Feng thought that if everyone had the same effect, then cultivators at the fourth rank or higher would be worth nothing.Soon he found the reasons:Firstly, he had never taken any herbs before therefore he could absorb the herb to a high degree. Secondly, the Air Pushing Breathing Technique had reached the third level, which made Zhao Feng\u2019s strength reach the third rank even while he was at the second rank. Thirdly, Zhao Feng felt that his body was slowly changing after it merging with the left eye.Zhao Feng calmed down soon as he realised that many others in the Zhao sect had already reached the third rank at his age. He could only be considered talented, not a genius.Taking Zhao Yufei for example, she had reached the peak of the third rank two months ago and had already almost learned Inner Strength, which meant that she had the strength of a quasi martial artist.\u201cI am probably at the same level as Xin Fei and Zhao Yijian. However, I do not have confidence in winning against them.\u201dAfter all, Xin Fei and Zhao Yijian had learnt high rank martial arts skills, and had at least trained them to the low level.For the next two days, Zhao Feng consolidated his cultivation.While he was training in the Air Pushing Breathing Technique he realised that there was a low humming sound. Zhao Feng emboldened his left eye and realised that there was a faint green and red glow forming between his blood and skin.\u201cAir Pushing Breathing Technique is nearing the peak of the third level. My strength is not any weaker than Zhao Yufei or Xin Fei who have quasi martial artist strength.\u201dOnce Air Pushing Breathing Technique reached the peak of the third level he would have the chance at understanding Inner Strength.Most had to be half-step martial artists to reach this step. Even most peak third rankers could not do this.After he consolidated his foundation Zhao Feng left the inn and headed towards the Zhao sect. As for the other two blood plants, he did not plan to use them any time soon.As soon as Zhao Feng left the inn, a beggar wearing torn clothes turned and ran not far away from him.\u201cMaster Xin, he has come out!\u201d The beggar arrived at a restaurant and reported to a youth clad in silver.\u201cOk, here\u2019s your promised silver.\u201d The youth had a cold smile.\u2026\u2026.As Zhao Feng turned into an alleyway, he heard footsteps thundering from behind.Teng sou sou \u2014\u2014\u2014-Two or three shadows flipped over the wall and pursued him from behind.\u201cWho\u2019s there!?\u201dZhao Feng immediately turned around.\u201cKid! Leave ten thousand silver and we\u2019ll let you go.\u201d Three disciples of the Xin family said as they surrounded Zhao Feng. The one that talked was the youth in silver.Xin Gang!Zhao Feng immediately recognised the youth.The three disciples in front of him had all reached the third rank and Xin Gang had reached the peak of the third rank.\u201cTen thousand silver? Just you three?\u201d Zhao Feng said indifferently as he stood straight.He had spent near ten thousand silver in Sun Feather City and still had ten thousand left. These people obviously planned to take it all for themselves.\u201cKid! I\u2019m warning you, do not be too arrogant! I was injured the last time, that\u2019s why you won. Today we\u2019re going to have payback for the \u201closses\u201d we had back in Sky Cloud Forest.\u201d\u201cHmph\u2026\u2026 that day you took sixty percent of the tiger\u2019s worth while one person from our sect died.\u201d One of the Xin disciples had greed and unwillingness in his eyes.\u201cStop speaking such nonsense! We\u2019ll take him down quickly in case some accidents happen.\u201d The youth on the left said as he kicked towards Zhao Feng. Immediately after the two others followed suit.\u201cHahaha, a bunch of trash.\u201d Zhao Feng laughed as he jumped seven metres off the ground and landed on top of the wall of a mansion.He had easily dodged the three frenzied attacks.\u201cDon\u2019t let him run away!\u201d Xin Gang roared and was the first to leap towards Zhao Feng.\u201cRun?\u201d Zhao Feng looked mockingly at Xin Gang as he immediately used the Air Pushing Breathing Technique and Lightly Floating Ferry, leaving behind an afterimage in the air.Not good!Xin Gang felt an unbearable pressure coming from his side.Pah\u2014-Xin Gang, who was in mid-air, barely managed to block one punch.Wah!Although he blocked it, the forced still made him smash into a stone wall which made him cough out blood.\u201cThis kid\u2019s strength has probably reached the quasi fourth rank. I cannot even take one of his hits.\u201d Xin Gang felt his eyes go black and immediately warned his peers: \u201cXin Yu, Xin Chen watch out!\u201d However, before he finished warning them there was a scream coming from his left.\u201cAhhhhhh\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201d Another youth had his bones broken.\u201cRun!\u201d The last Xin disciples was scared out of his wits and tried to run. However, before he could escape, a whistling sound came from behind.Peh!He felt his eyes turn black before he could even see the attack\u2026..In terms of speed, Zhao Feng had learnt a high rank martial art skill and when used, could be compared to martial artists of the fourth rank.\u201cI will let you off the hook this time, but if you anger me again\u2026..\u201d Zhao Feng looked coldly at Xin Gang and then, like a bird, floated away.\u201cWhat incredible strength and speed\u2026\u2026.\u201d The youth next to Xin Gang said dazed.\u201cThis Zhao Feng has just reached the third rank and already has the strength of a \u2018quasi martial artist\u2019.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s strength right now could be compared with Xin Fei\u2019s.After finishing off Xin Gang and company, Zhao Feng returned to the Zhao sect.A few disciples that were familiar with Zhao Feng were surprised by his cultivation.\u201cWhen did Zhao Feng reach the third rank of the Martial Path?\u201d They all knew that Zhao Feng\u2019s strength was only at the first rank twenty days ago!\u201cI heard that Zhao Feng and some Xin family disciples killed a \u201cGreen Headed Tiger King\u201d yesterday and he then stole over half of the spoils\u2026.\u201d One well-informed Zhao disciple said.\u201cOne deadly beast is worth around twenty to thirty thousand silver. This kid\u2019s definitely bought some super expensive herb that increased his cultivation.\u201d\u201cWhat is so amazing about using outer help to increase one\u2019s cultivation? Those people usually have lower strength.\u201d\u2026\u2026These disciples were all either envious or disdainful.Zhao Feng never thought that the information would reach the sect so fast. Not bothering with these people, Zhao Feng walked straight ahead. Soon he arrived at home.He first saw his mother Zhao Shi sewing clothes.\u201cFather, mother, here is one thousand silver.\u201d Zhao Feng walked inside the room and took out a stack of silver.\u201cOne thousand silver?\u201d Zhao Shi stared as she picked up the notes.\u201cHow did you get so much money?\u201d Zhao Tianyang said in surprise. When he saw that his son\u2019s cultivation had reached the third rank, a strange glimmer passed through his eyes.\u201cIt happened like this\u2026..\u201d Zhao Feng then told them a simplistic story of what had happened in Sky Cloud Forest. After listening to the story, Zhao Tianyang and Zhao Shi had a tinge of questioning apart from their excitement. After all, Zhao Feng did not use to have such a superb performance. However, being parents, they obviously wanted their children to be successful.Zhao Feng sat crossed legged in his room and surveyed the worn out room, \u201cThere is still one more month until the family sparring contest. If I can become an inner disciple\u2026. My parents\u2019 status and treatment should become a bit higher\u2026..\u201dClosing his eyes, Zhao Feng\u2019s consciousness entered the pitch black dimension inside his left eye. The faint green ring had extended to three feet.When Zhao Feng was at the first rank, the green ring\u2019s length was one feet, and it was two feet when his cultivation reached the second rank. Now, it was three feet as he reached the third rank.As the green ring extended, Zhao Feng found that the power of his left eye increased. He could see every item in detail in a range of ten miles. His mind\u2019s energy and reaction speed had also significantly increased.Thinking up to here, Zhao Feng started to \u201cdecipher\u201d Lightly Floating Ferry once more.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSoon there was less and less of Lightly Floating Ferry left undeciphered.One-third left\u2026.. One-quarter left\u2026.. One-fifth left\u2026\u2026Night. Just as Zhao Feng was exhausted, the last bit of Lightly Floating Ferry was deciphered. At this moment Zhao Feng held his breath as he viewed its contents.\u201cThis footwork skill can even\u2026\u2026.\u201dSuddenly, his expression was replaced by ecstasy!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Lightly Floating Ferry, Late page: Only with the Air Crossing Breathing Technique can one wield it to its fullest potential. It will be unsurpassable by all those under the seventh rank and is a peak speed skill for all those under the ninth rank. Below is the contents of the Air Crossing Breathing Technique and the minimum requirement are being at the peak of the third rank of the Martial Path as well as Inner Strength.As the last tenth of the skill was deciphered, Zhao Feng released his excitement. He never thought that a skill such as Lightly Floating Ferry would have a complementary skill. This was technically buffing Lightly Floating Ferry to an ever higher level.Zhao Feng could now confirm that Lightly Floating Ferry was at least a peak rank martial art skill. Most people knew that martial arts were split into Core, Low, Middle, High and Peak. However this did not mean that peak ranked martial arts skills were at the top. There were rumours of Holy Martial Skills, skills that surpassed peak ranked martial arts skills.Likewise, there was the Holy Martial Path above the nine ranks of Martial Path.Zhao Feng had heard however that, to enter the Holy Martial Path, one needed to learn a Holy Martial Skill.Obviously, with Zhao Feng\u2019s status, he couldn\u2019t even think about \u201cHoly\u201d skills.Even the true martial artists of Sun Feather City could not touch the level of the Holy Martial Path.\u2026\u2026Night.Zhao Feng had finally deciphered all of its contents. Now, the entire Lightly Floating Ferry was displayed.\u201cIf I can gain an understanding of Inner strength right now, any opponent under the fourth rank will not be a match for me.\u201dZhao Feng immediately started to learn the contents of Lightly Floating Ferry. Once Lightly Floating Ferry entered the beginning stages Zhao Feng could immediately start using Inner Strength.Half an hour later Zhao Feng had only just understood some parts of Lightly Floating Ferry.However, to try and understand Inner Strength through Lightly Floating Ferry alone was still a bit difficult.Sun Feather City had thousands of cultivators who had reached the peak of the third rank, but many of them would never understand Inner Strength and reach the fourth rank.Even some of the sect\u2019s talented youths, such as Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yufei had been stuck for a while and had yet to succeed.Zhao Feng ended that night with failure.\u201cDon\u2019t rush! I have just stepped into the realm of the third rank and if I can train the Air Pushing Breathing Technique to the peak of the third level, I believe that my chances of success will increase.\u201dThe second day, Zhao Feng once again started to train in the Air Pushing Breathing Technique as well as Angry Dragon Fists. On the third day the Air Pushing Breathing Technique was slowly moving towards the peak of the third level. Zhao Feng felt that his body strength had reached a limit now, every time he operated it he felt as if it had reached its peak.He once again tried to condense Inner Strength, but it again resulted in failure. Every time he failed, his strength would fall into a period of exhaustion.Although Zhao Feng understood the Air Crossing Breathing Technique, to actually successfully form Inner Strength was an entirely different matter.However, Zhao Feng did not give up, and every time he tried there would be subtle improvements.On the same day, Zhao Feng received a notice.\u201cTomorrow noon there will be a very powerful martial artist giving a lecture on the martial arts field.\u201dEvery outer disciple had heard this news.\u201cAn open lecture on the martial arts field?\u201dMaybe it was because the family sparring contest was only one month away, but the outer disciples all started to put in more effort as well.Zhao Feng was very expectant of this lecture. He had only been at the Zhao sect for half a year and this was the first time he had this kind of chance.The morning of the fourth day.Although it wasn\u2019t noon yet, there were already a lot of Zhao sect disciples here. Zhao Feng even saw many strong outer disciples that weren\u2019t usually seen.\u201cLook\u2026. Those are two of the top three outer disciples\u201d Zhao Yufei and Zhao Yijian! Even Zhao Guang who is ranked fifth is here!\u201dThe main focus of these people were those at the peak amongst the outer disciples.At the Zhao sect there were over one thousand youths from the age of thirteen to eighteen. Over half of them had cultivations of the second rank. Obviously, when Zhao Feng came, he was indeed the bottom\u2026\u2026.On the field, those that that held the most attention were those that ranked in the top ten and top twenty.The most focused on person was Zhao Yufei, who was fourteen or fifteen years of age. Her beauty stood out amongst the crowd.She wasn\u2019t just pretty, she also had great talent and was ranked third, equal with Zhao Yijian.\u201cLook! That is Zhao Yue who is ranked first!\u201dThere was a buzz as Zhao Yue appeared.Zhao Feng did not even need to find him as the crowd split apart by itself. Through the pathway came a youth, sixteen or seventeen years of age. He wore azure coloured clothes and had a simplistic face.\u201cHe is Zhao Yue?\u201d It was Zhao Feng\u2019s first time seeing Zhao Yue, he had only heard rumours about him before.Zhao Yue\u2019s was older than most disciples, being seventeen years of age. This was because once someone became eighteen years old, they were considered adults and could no longer be counted as the younger generation.Zhao Yue often cultivated effortlessly inside his own room, so it wasn\u2019t common for him to be seen by others.At this moment, Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes locked onto Zhao Yue and felt the tremendous pressure coming from him. Although their ranks were the same, Zhao Feng could feel the pressure that being emitted byhim.Zhao Feng also felt the immense strength hiding in Zhao Yue\u2019s muscles. Because Zhao Yue was older, this meant that he had cultivated longer and had the best foundation. In terms of strength, he was definitely ranked first!No wonder he\u2019s worthy of the title of being the strongest outer disciples!Zhao Feng felt like he couldn\u2019t find any flaws on him. As Zhao Yue appeared, Zhao Yijian who was ranked third, and Zhao Guang who was ranked fifth, showed their fighting intent.There wasn\u2019t much difference in strength between the top five outer disciples.There was still a bit of time before the lecture started.Soon, there was another shout.\u201cZhao Gan\u2019s here!\u201d\u201cZhao Gan? The person ranked amongst the top five?\u201d The gazes of many disciples turned towards a certain direction.The youth that came was a short haired youth who\u2019s body was as slim as a leopard.Zhao Gan?Zhao Feng felt that the name was familiar. Soon he remembered that this person was Zhao Kun\u2019s brother. And sure enough, behind Zhao Gan came a familiar figure, Zhao Kun!Zhao Kun had also spotted Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng only saw him walk to his brother and say something.En?Zhao Gan spun around and his cold eyes locked onto Zhao Feng.\u201cYou\u2019re that Zhao Feng?\u201d Zhao Gan said expressionlessly as he walked over.Hua!There was a shock that went through the crowd.\u201cWhat is going on? Why would Zhao Gan trouble someone who is so unknown?\u201d\u201cUnknown?\u201d Someone shook his head and mocked, \u201cZhao Feng is not some unknown brat. A few days ago he killed a Green Headed Tiger king by accident!\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s him!\u201d\u201cI heard that he beat up Zhao Gan\u2019s little brother. I bet you Zhao Gan is coming for revenge.\u201d\u2026\u2026After a short discussion the crowd soon calmed down. Most of the disciples had playful looks on their faces as Zhao Gan was ranked fifth in the outer disciples.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt this moment, even Zhao Yue, who was ranked first, Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yufei, who were equally ranked third, looked over.Zhao Yijian had a gloating expression on his face. He knew Zhao Gan\u2019s strength quite well. Zhao Xue, who was next to Zhao Yijian, sighed, but after remembering how Zhao Feng had acted in the Medicine Pavilion, it was replaced by coldness.On the other side, Zhao Yufei had an interested look. Zhao Feng\u2019s performance at the archery field had made her shocked. At this time, Zhao Feng was one of the main focuses on the field.\u201cKid, today you are going to get humiliated in front of the crowd.\u201d Zhao Kun lips curled into a smile. Zhao Gan walked step by step, and every step he took caused the atmosphere to tense up.\u201cYes, I am Zhao Feng.\u201d Zhao Feng gave a off faint smile as he sized up Zhao Gan.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Instead he faced off Zhao Gan. This sight caused many other disciples to be shocked.\u201cWhen did Zhao Feng break through to the third rank?\u201d Zhao Kun and company finally realised Zhao Feng\u2019s change. Even Zhao Xue who was standing next to Zhao Yijian was shocked.\u201cHmph! Just a useless piece of trash using outside help to break through. These people are especially vulnerable.\u201d Zhao Yijian said disdainfully.\u201cMaybe.\u201d Zhao Xue answered.\u201cZhao Feng, you are stronger than I imagined. No wonder you could beat up my brother.\u201d Zhao Gan praised Zhao Feng as he stopped two yards away from him.\u201cStop praising me, you\u2019re here to take revenge for my brother, I presume?\u201d Zhao Feng faintly smiled.\u201cYes!\u201d Zhao Gan swiftly continued, \u201cAlthough my brother is a useless piece of trash\u2026\u2026. He is still my brother.\u201d Zhao Kun\u2019s face turned ugly as Zhao Gan spoke. This brother of his never gave any face to anyone.Zhao Gan continued, \u201cYou aree younger than me and have just reached the third rank. So I won\u2019t bully you. If you can live past my first ten moves then I will let this off the hook.\u201d\u201cSure.\u201d Zhao Feng was a bit surprised by how Zhao Gan acted. Zhao Kun\u2019s brother was not as arrogant as he had imagined.The two faced off on a piece of spare land on the martial arts field.\u201cIt is starting now\u2026..\u201dZhao Gan\u2019s aura suddenly became cold and his four limbs started to bend, like a poisonous snake.Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake!Some of the disciples knew the history of the move. Being Zhao Gan\u2019s opponent, Zhao Feng felt a unknown chill. While both brother\u2019s had learnt Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake, Zhao Gan could give him great pressure.\u201cSecond change of the Poisonous Snake!\u201dZhao Gan, like a snake, struck towards Zhao Feng\u2019s head.Zhao Feng only felt a chill come towards his head. The opponent\u2019s speed and power was double that of Zhao Kun\u2019s. It was good that his left eye could still easily see the route of Zhao Gan\u2019s attack, so he put up a fist to block.Pah!Zhao Feng threw off Zhao Gan with his punch, but he felt that the opponent\u2019s body was like butter. Zhao Gan twisted on the ground and then used explosive speed and power to charge back towards Zhao Feng.\u201cNo wonder he is worthy of being the fifth best outer disciple!\u201d He had a feeling that his opponent wasn\u2019t a person, but a deadly, cunning snake instead.Pah! Pah! Pah\u2026\u2026Zhao Feng had a solemn look on his face as he faced off against Zhao Gan. In that short amount of time, Zhao Feng had almost lost many times.\u201cI wonder how far I can go without using my left eye.\u201d Zhao Feng was very calm. Once he used his left eye, his reaction speed and vision increased dramatically, so it would not be any challenge for him.Of course, without using his left eye, Zhao Feng\u2019s reaction speed had already surpassed martial learners of the same rank.At the beginning, Zhao Feng was under great pressure. However, as the fight continued, he used his experience and battle prowess to fight against Zhao Gan.Pah! Pah! Beng\u2026\u2026..The two shadows fought together on the field. The two of them both used close battle skills, and the speed they fought at was extremely fast.\u201cZhao Feng\u2019s strength is stronger than I imagined.\u201d\u201cIt has already been five moves.\u201d A few of the other disciples felt that it was unbelievable.\u201cHis improvement is so insanely fast.\u201dZhao Xue\u2019s breathing started to increase.Not far away, Zhao Kun kept wiping the sweat off his forehead. He thought that with his brother\u2019s strength, he would only need two or three moves to take Zhao Feng down, but the latter had unexpectedly improved so much.Soon it was the sixth move!Just as Zhao Feng and Zhao Gan were on par with each other.\u201cFourth Change of the Poisonous Snake!\u201dZhao Gan\u2019s movements became like the sea. It churned, jumped and wrapped around Zhao Feng. As the fourth change began, Zhao Gan\u2019s damage increased dramatically.Zhao Feng felt the pressure increase and remembered that Zhao Kun had only learnt the first three changes of Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake.Zhao Gan however had learnt the first seven changes! Every change after was harder to learn but the damage would likewise increased dramatically. Zhao Feng felt as if his opponent had no bones and that he was coming closer and closer\u2026\u2026..Shuah!Zhao Feng, on instinct, used Lightly Floating Ferry to pull away from Zhao Gan. Close combat was the forte of Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake, even Angry Dragon Fists was difficult against it.Teng! Teng!Zhao Feng, in terms of speed, was always faster than Zhao Gan.The eight move, the ninth move\u2026.. The tenth move!The two shadows split apart as the disciples who were watching held their breath.\u201cYou have won.\u201d Zhao Gan deeply looked at Zhao Feng, and seemed helpless. He then turned around and left, leaving a crowd of shocked disciples behind.\u201cThank you for going easy.\u201d Zhao Feng gave a faint smile. He did not use all his strength in this fight. For example, Zhao Feng did not use his left eye to its extreme. He also did not use Lightly Floating Ferry or the Air Pushing Breathing Technique to their highest potentials.He had two reasons for this.Firstly, he wanted to see how strong he was without the use of his left eye.Secondly, he wanted to leave some hidden cards for the family sparring contest.The result was very obvious. When he restrained himself from using these things he was on par with Zhao Gan. Obviously, Zhao Feng could not confirm if Zhao Gan had left some hidden moves either as the two of them had only exchanged ten blows.\u201cWhen did he get so strong\u2026\u2026?\u201d A few of those who were familiar with Zhao Feng now stared at him with their eyes open. Zhao Kun was even more exaggerated, he opened his mouth like a wooden chicken.\u201cBig brother, if you cannot beat him in ten moves you can still beat him up for me.\u201d Zhao Kun said as he caught up to Zhao Gan.\u201cYou better give up. Even if there were no restrictions I cannot beat him either. His speed is too fast for me.\u201d Zhao Gan shook his head.\u201cHow is this possible!\u201d Zhao Kun knew that his brother did not lie. It wasn\u2019t his attitude.\u201cHe won\u2026..\u201d Zhao Xue\u2019s body turned rigid as she looked complexly at the youth not far away. That youth seemed especially handsome, tall, than it was ever was at this point\u2026\u2026\u201cThis kid actually has a few tricks.\u201d Zhao Yijian had a cold expression on his face, \u201cBut he only fought against Zhao Gan for ten moves\u2026\u2026 while Zhao Gan has already lost to me long ago!\u201d Zhao Xue let out a breath as she heard Zhao Yijian\u2019s words.She did not understand why she was so afraid of Zhao Feng becoming strong. The stronger he became, the more she felt conflicted.\u2026\u2026..After the sparring match the field resumed to its original state.This was because it was nearing noon and the powerful martial artist would be giving the lecture soon.\u201cCoach Chen is here!\u201dThe crowd suddenly became excited.Zhao Feng followed everyone\u2019s eyesights and saw a tall, muscular man slowly walk onto the martial arts field.\u201cThis is Coach Chen.\u201d Zhao Feng secretly opened his left eye and saw that there was a faint yellow glow being emitting from his blood.The inner strength was pushed every time he let out a breath, this created an unseen pressure.Why did powerful people have a different aura and create unseen pressure? Zhao Feng understood a bit through looking at him.At this moment, every step Coach Chen took and every glance he made created pressure. This aura belonged to Martial Artists. Any martial learner under the fourth rank might not even have the courage to attack.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSo strong!\u201d The disciples had faces of awe and fear. How many martial learners on Green Flower Continent wanted to have the title of Martial artist? Even Zhao Feng was similar.However, his goal was not limited to this. His goal was \u201cMartial Master\u201d, those that had the seventh rank or higher\u2026. And even the rumoured Holy Martial Path\u2026..\u201cToday I am going to talk about how the skills for martial learners of the third rank or lower should be used. I will also be talking about my experience of Inner strength\u2026\u2026\u201d Coach Chen\u2019s voice was deep but not loud. However, even those that were a few hundred metres away could hear him clearly.After hearing \u201cexperiences of Inner strength\u201d, Zhao Yijian, Zhao Yufei and Zhao Yue had their eyes brighten.\u201cInner Strength of the martial path?

The first three ranks are known as the Power ranks and have the title of Martial Learners. The fourth to sixth ranks are known as Martial Artists, and the seventh to ninth rank are known as Martial Masters. Everyone who are Martial Masters have a high status, even the Zhao Sect does not have many of them.\u201d Coach Chen simply explained about the nine ranks of the Martial Path.\u201cEvery three ranks have a huge gap between them.\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s mind drew a simple diagram.First three ranks: Strengthen the body and set up a good foundation.Fourth to sixth rank: Form Inner strength. Every move and action far surpasses the power of Martial Learners.Seventh to ninth ranks: Upgrading Inner Strength to \u201cTransformation Strength\u201d, which can attack through the air.There were rumours in Cloud Country of \u201cBig Martial Masters\u201d, those who had reached the peak of the ninth rank and had the title of \u201cTen Thousand Men Army\u201d, that could easily kill their enemies.In their eyes, normal martial artists and deadly beasts were ants.\u201cFirst we will talk about the first and second rank of the martial path. Through martial art skills, we strengthen our body and blood\u2026\u2026\u201d Coach Chen first talked about the foundation of the first two ranks.Many of the disciples on the field had already reached the third rank so they did not pay much attention to it. Zhao Feng paid close attention as he had been at the first rank of the Martial Path for a very long time. And the one hundred or so martial art books in his mind were then viewed differently.He suddenly remembered the first skill he learnt, Flaming Metal Fists. Slowly, the moves, experience and skills faded out of his memory.Zhao Feng was shocked as he did not know what this meant. The only thing he knew was that Flaming Metal Fists had reached its perfection. He did not realised that he had accidentally entered a \u201cmeditational state\u201d. These states were rare, even for geniuses.\u201cNext we will talk about the skills of the second and third rank, and how to execute them\u2026..\u201d Coach Chen didn\u2019t just speak, he also showed how to practise them.Being a true martial artist, any move Coach Chen showed were all middle ranked martial arts trained to the peak level. Even if Coach Chen used the power of the third rank and middle ranked martial arts, he could still easily beat the top ten disciples.\u201cLastly, I will be telling you tricks about Inner Strength .A few of you have already reached the peak of the third rank and are just a bit away from entering the fourth rank.\u201d As Coach Chen spoke up to here, his lips curled into a smile. The top ten outer disciples had all reached the peak of the third rank.\u201cEven I cannot fully explain how Inner Strength works. The key point is how each of you understands Inner Strength. All I can do is give you some of my experiences\u2026..\u201d Coach Chen\u2019s voice turned low. Just as he finished his sentence, he gave a frightening aura.At that moment, all the Zhao sect disciples were unable to breathe properly. The unseen pressure flooded over all the martial learners.\u201cWhat strength! Is this inner strength? If I had that I could try to break through to become a true martial artist\u2026..\u201d The crowd held their breaths as they looked on in awe.\u201cInner Strength is after all, a type of power that forms from within one\u2019s body. Thus, strong blood is the key point in forming Inner Strength. And the strength of one\u2019s blood depends on how strong one\u2019s body and bones are. This is also why the first three ranks are known as the \u201cPower ranks\u201d. They provide a solid foundation to be built on.\u201d Coach Chen said as he demonstrated.\u201cRock Breaking Palm!\u201d A faint yellow glow emitted from the centre of his palm.Peh\u2014-Before the palm even hit the ground, the forced from the palm had already arrived.\u201cAh!\u201dThat palm\u2019s power, filled with Inner Strength, was like a mountain that came crushing towards the disciples. The aura alone could make the martial learners lose.Plop!Three disciples of the second rank who stood at the front fell onto the ground.\u201cHmph! I can see that your foundation is weak. The wind from my palm has already made you fall. If it was someone of the seventh rank or higher instead of me, you guys would have already been crushed into pieces\u2026\u2026.\u201d Coach Chen shook his head.As he was explaining and demonstrating, one youth was like a sculpture that didn\u2019t move. After Coach Chen finished his demonstration the youth closed his eyes.\u201cInner strength is like that\u2026..\u201d Zhao Feng closed his eyes. In his mind, the picture of a person\u2019s body once again came up.At a certain point, a faint yellow glow came from inside the blood. When Coach Chen was demonstrating earlier, Zhao Feng had used his left eye to get a better look\u2026\u2026\u2026His eye had caught every subtle change in Coach Chen\u2019s body, including how inner strength was formed. In his mind, this scene was now being replayed back and forth. Maybe Coach Chen himself could not understand the changes in his body so precisely.Next, Coach Chen demonstrated some of his own experiences again.Every time he demonstrated, Zhao Feng would use his left eye to observe.While the other disciples could only hear the \u201creasoning\u201d, Zhao Feng could fully 'see\u201d how it was formed.Half an hour later, Coach Chen\u2019s lecture ended.\u201cYou cannot force Inner Strength. To form Inner Strength you must have good talent and a solid foundation.\u201d Coach Chen shook his head as he left. It was obvious that he did not have much hope in these outer disciples.If his explanation could make one or two of them understand inner strength, it would have been unexpected\u2026..After Coach Chen left, most disciples were left with questioning faces. After all, Inner Strength could not be described. It was different for everyone.Obviously, the disciples that ranked highly had gained some insights.Zhao Yue, who was ranked first and Zhao Yijian sometimes had expressions of thought and sometimes expressions of happiness\u2026..Zhao Yufei\u2019s eyebrows were slightly fluttering.As for Zhao Feng, he closed his eyes while standing still. Inside his mind, the memory of Coach Chen performing was played over and over\u2026..A while later.Zhao Feng let out a breath as he hurriedly returned home.Bang!As soon as he got home he closed the room and sat down cross-legged.\u201cI have finally understood how Inner Strength works\u2026..\u201d Inside his mind, the late pages of Lightly Floating Ferry came up once again.According to the Air Pushing Breathing Technique, if he trained it to the peak of the third level, he would have the foundation to form Inner Strength.The same day he fully absorbed the insights he gained. At night, Zhao Feng performed the Air Pushing Breathing Technique a few times to confirm that he had reached the peak of the third level.\u201cIt is starting now\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Feng took a deep breath as he slowly tried to form Inner Strength.According to Lightly Floating Ferry, Zhao Feng slowly pushed his blood together.Compared with the Air Pushing Breathing Technique, the standards of Lightly Floating Ferry were much higher.Soon Zhao Feng\u2019s blood passed through his body.Everything went smoothly.However, just at the end, Zhao Feng felt like he had no energy left.The reason was because, although Zhao Feng\u2019s blood was strong, he was lacking in quantity. In terms of blood strength he could be compared to \u201cZhao Yue\u201d, but in terms of quantity he was still a way off.Zhao Feng had not reached the peak of the third rank, and the way in which Lightly Floating Ferry formed Inner Strength was harder than most other skills.\u201cIf I fail, my blood will fall into a period of weakness and it will be harder for me to form it next time\u2026.\u201d Zhao Feng bit his teeth as he took out a two hundred year old blood plant.Hu!Zhao Feng sucked in a breath as the energy from the blood plant merged into his bloodstream.Weng~Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAt the last moment Zhao Feng felt the blood rushing within him.Ha!A shout as loud as lightning sounded within the room, causing the windows to rattle.Suddenly, the room went became dark due to the fact that the candle had been blown out.Under the moonlight there was a youth full of anticipation who slowly opened his palm\u2026. Then, a beautiful faint green glow appeared\u2026\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

If one did not look closely, one would not be able to see it. This was the first thread of Inner Strength that Zhao Feng had formed. He had never thought that his dream would be so close to him.Once someone formed their first thread of Inner Strength, the bottleneck to the fourth rank would be almost non-existent.For Zhao Feng, it was now only a matter of time. He only needed to reach the peak of the third rank and he would be able to step into the fourth rank, becoming a true martial artist.\u201cThere is not any other outer disciples in the Zhao sect that have formed their first thread of Inner Strength yet. Not even Zhao Yue and Zhao Yijian\u2026\u2026\u201d When Zhao Feng thought up to here he had a satisfied expression.Being able to form Inner strength at the third rank meant that he was unstoppable for his cultivation level.\u201cThe two-hundred year old blood plant cannot go to waste.\u201d Zhao Feng felt that his body still had remnants left from the blood plant so he formed a few more threads of Inner Strength.Inner strength was one\u2019s strength compressed into a higher level. To consolidate his Inner Strength, Zhao Feng meditated for one day and one night.The moment he stepped out of his room he felt that every breath of his could instantly conjure great pressure.Zhao Feng\u2019s parents were also aware of this.\u201cFeng\u2019er seems a bit different. It seems he has more energy nowadays.\u201d Zhao Shi smiled.\u201cIt is time for his growth spurt.\u201d His father Zhao Tianyang even felt a faint pressure emanating from Zhao Feng.Their feelings were not wrong. These changes indeed did occur on Zhao Feng.After merging with the mysterious eye, Zhao Feng\u2019s blood had started to slowly change\u2026..The most obvious point was his strength, it had increased at a rapid rate.His height and mental energy were also growing.Adding on the change of his heart state, his whole aura had changed.\u201cEven my parents can see that I have changed. This means that martial artists can easily see that I have formed Inner Strength.\u201d Zhao Feng went into deep thought. There was still one month left until the family sparring contest, and his goal was to enter the top three!\u201cI need a way to hide my Inner strength.\u201d Soon, the one hundred martial art skills popped up in his mind.He soon chose a skill named \u201cHiding Air Technique\u201d.The Hiding Air Technique was not a combat skill, it could not even increase one\u2019s cultivation. The reason why Zhao Feng picked it up before was because it was a peak middle ranked martial art, the same level as Angry Dragon Fists.If Hiding Air Technique was trained to the low level, it could hide one\u2019s inner strength and cultivation. When it reached the high level, one could control one\u2019s aura. When it reached the peak level, one could erase one\u2019s aura, which could be used for tracking and spying. Even a dog would be unable to smell one\u2019s presence.Zhao Feng began to train in the Hiding Air Technique on the same day. Although it was a peak, middle ranked martial art it was easy for to Zhao Feng to train in it.Using just half a day worth of time, Zhao Feng had already trained the Hiding Air Technique to the low level, which meant that he could now conceal his inner strength. Even true martial artists of the fourth rank or higher would be unable to find out that Zhao Feng had inner strength.\u201cAccording to the book, one needed at least a few months to train it to the low level.\u201d Zhao Feng was slightly shocked, but then he thought about how he had even learnt Lightly Floating Ferry, which was a high rank martial art.Since the Hiding Air Technique was now at the low level, Zhao Feng could now openly walk around.After a few more days it was the time for signing up for the family sparring contest.\u201cFeng\u2019er you can sign up for the family sparring contest now. Do not forget to register.\u201d Zhao Tianyang warned him.\u201cOk, I will go right now.\u201d Zhao Feng was very confident.Zhao Tianyang nodded his head, \u201cYou have already reached the third rank. You should be able to reach the top one hundred.\u201d\u201cTop one hundred?\u201d Zhao Feng laughed as he shook his head. His parents did not have much confidence in him. Zhao Feng felt certain that if he could not place first, he could still place in the top three.Soon after, Zhao Feng arrived at the registering place.The family sparring contest was held once every three years and the signup time was one month before the contest itself.There were many other disciples lining up when Zhao Feng arrived.\u201cDid you hear? This year\u2019s rewards are extremely good!\u201d One Zhao disciple said.\u201cRewards? Tell us! No wonder you are an inner disciple.\u201d A few surrounding disciples had interested expressions as they looked towards the inner disciple.Their discussion caught Zhao Feng\u2019s attention. He looked at the inner disciple who had a cultivation at the peak of the third rank. From the aura he released, his strength was at least on par with Zhao Gan.\u201cNo wonder he\u2019s worthy of being an inner disciple.\u201d Zhao Feng thought, \u201cAny random inner disciple has such strength.\u201d\u201cThose that become one of the top fifty will become inner disciples and will have the chance to enter the second floor of the Martial Arts Library and choose a high rank martial art skill. They will also receive a three-hundred year old blood plant. Those that reach the top twenty can choose two high ranked martial arts skill and will get two, three-hundred year old blood plants.\u201dThe inner disciple paused.\u201cWhoa! Three-hundred year old blood plants! The sect is spending a lot of money for this year\u2019s contest.\u201d\u201cHigh rank martial arts skills! Normal disciples will probably never even learn one.\u201d The disciples around seemed shocked by the news. Even Zhao Feng felt excited.A three-hundred year old blood plant was worth three thousand silver. Obviously, the fact that they got to enter the second floor of the Martial Arts Library was more exciting to him.\u201cIf I get the chance to go inside the second floor of the Martial Arts Library, I can take out a large amount of high ranked skills.\u201d Zhao Feng was full of anticipation.This time the inner disciple continued, \u201cThe top ten can choose two high rank martial arts and will also get a five-hundred year old blood plant!\u201dFive-hundred year old blood plant!Many disciples rubbed their palms together as they thought about it. One five-hundred year old blood plant was worth ten thousand silver!\u201cApparently the top three can choose a peak rank skill, two high ranked skills and will also get a \u201cYun blood pill.\u201d\u201cPeak rank martial art!\u201d\u201cYun blood pill?\u201dSomeone who trained a peak rank martial art could cultivate up to the ninth rank of the Martial Path. As for the \u201cYun blood pill\u201d, it was a precious pill that helped increase one\u2019s cultivation.This type of precious pill was worth over fifty thousand silver\u2026\u2026\u201cWhat does first place get?\u201d Someone asked.\u201cYou are right. Usually first place gets an extra reward.\u201d A few Zhao disciples said.\u201cFirst place will definitely have extra rewards, but even I do not know what that is.\u201d The inner disciple shook his head.Ah.The disciples felt disappointed. However, because they did not know, they felt more intrigued to find out.After waiting for a long time. Zhao Feng finally arrived at the registration place and took a badge. The badge had a number of 188 on it. Zhao Feng knew now knew what his number was.The Zhao sect had a few hundred disciples entering the contest. According to the rules, there were only fifty spots for inner disciples under the age of eighteen.There were fifty inner disciples at the moment.This meant that some inner disciples may be eliminated and then replaced by the newer generation of disciples. Therefore, this contest was very cruel.After signing up Zhao Feng returned home to work even harder.Days passed. The time for the family sparring contest became closer and closer.Twenty days before the family sparring contest started there was already an estimated ranking list. And the person who ranked first was an inner disciple who was the genius of of the Zhao sect, Zhao Linlong!Zhao Linlong had reached the fourth rank of the Martial Path two years ago. He was ranked third in the last contest. At that time he wasn\u2019t even fifteen years old.Now, he was one of the four geniuses of Sun Feather City. There was no doubt that he was the strongest!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSecond place was Zhao Chi, third place Zhao Han, fourth place Zhao Qin\u2026\u2026 Twenty-first place Zhao Yue! When Zhao Feng saw this he took a cold breath. Zhao Yue, who was first amongst the outer disciples, did not even reach the top twenty of the inner disciples.Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yufei were respectively ranked thirty-eight and forty.As for Zhao Gan and Zhao Guang who were both ranked in the top five amongst the outer disciples, they were ranked overall as forty-ninth and fifty-third. The ranking had a total of one hundred people. Zhao Feng kept on looking.Finally!At the second to last name on the list, Zhao Feng finally found his own name\u2026\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

And at least five hundred of them had entered the competition.If Zhao Feng did not merge with the mysterious eye he would not even have the right to enter right now.\u201cThere are still twenty days left. I need to use my time wisely\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Feng headed straight home to prepare for the competition.The time of the family sparring contest was coming closer and closer.All of the Zhao sect youths were under a tense atmosphere\u2026. Many disciples even broke through under this pressure\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026This was the result that the Zhao sect\u2019s higher level wanted.After Zhao Feng returned home, apart from consolidating his Inner Strength, he kept on training in Angry Dragon Fists. Up to now Angry Dragon Fists was Zhao Feng\u2019s most powerful attack skill.Half a month ago, he had trained Angry Dragon Fists to the high level.\u201dNow, his Angry Dragon Skill had reached the peak level.\u201dThe peak level represented ninety percent or higher of its maximum damage, which was more than fifty percent stronger than it in the high level. Up to now Zhao Feng had never heard of any other outer disciples who had trained a middle ranked skill to the peak level.There was still half a month left till the contest.Zhao Feng put even more energy into cultivating. His key focus was the Air Crossing Breathing Technique as it helped with Inner Strength. To further his cultivation, Zhao Feng even used his three-hundred year old blood plant.Since he had already formed the first few thread of Inner Strength, his cultivation had increased at an insane speed and easily broke through to the peak of the third rank. He was only half a step away from entering the fourth rank.Hu~Zhao Feng let out a long breath. He had trained his body to its maximum potential.\u201cThere are still three days left. I wonder if I can reach the fourth rank.\u201d Zhao Feng murmured.Being the Zhao sect\u2019s most favoured genius, Zhao Linlong had apparently reached the fourth rank two years ago.For the next two days, Zhao Feng tried to reach the fourth rank but failed at both of his attempts. This was within his expectations though.\u201cMy inner strength and body strength is still far away from reaching the fourth rank.\u201d Zhao Feng soon found the reason. The first three ranks of the Martial Path talked about a solid foundation. If the foundation was not solid, it would affect the realms later on.And for the past two months Zhao Feng had broken through at extreme speed, which made his foundation not be solid enough. Zhao Feng knew this and did not forcibly try to reach the fourth rank.Soon there was only one day left.\u201cThe family sparring contest will start tomorrow!\u201d Zhao Feng took a deep breath and a faint green glow appeared as he opened his palms. Having inner strength, he could instantly kill a cultivator of the third rank. Now, his strength was not that of a quasi martial artist anymore. It was that of a half step martial artist!A quasi martial artist could easily defeat a normal third rank in one or two moves and would even cause a certain amount of threat towards deadly beasts such as the Green Headed Tiger King. However, once one reached the point of half step martial artist, one\u2019s strength exceeded that of a quasi martial artist.Zhao Feng could now even exchange a few blows with the Green Headed Tiger King. The biggest difference between him and martial artists was not inner strength, instead it was body strength.That night, in a certain garden in the Zhao sect.Jiang!A sword was drawn from its sheath and created illusions in the air. The sword\u2019s owner was a youth clothed in purple. His sword\u2019s power had reached a frightening level.His casual strikes could be compared with Xin Fei\u2019s Cracking Wind Sword, which could kill cultivators of the third rank in one move.\u201cYijian\u2019er, not bad! You have already trained the high rank skill Cold Flowing Sword to the high level. Out of the outer disciples, it is probably only you who have trained a high rank martial art to the high level.\u201d A middle-aged man said smiling.The purple clothed youth was Zhao Yijian who was ranked third amongst the outer disciples.\u201cIt looks like the first place amongst the outer disciples will be changing soon. And Zhao Feng, that bug, will be crushed under my feet!\u201d Zhao Yijian said coldly.When he mentioned Zhao Feng, his sword suddenly fired five different blows. The strength he used would even shock true martial artists.\u201cYijian\u2019er, your eyesight is limited. Do not just think about the outer disciples.\u201d The middle aged man shook his head, \u201cYour true opponents are inner disciples! With your strength, you can easily make in into the top twenty, but you will be making me blush if you could make it to the top ten.\u201d\u201cYes, father! I am seventy percent sure that I can make the top ten.\u201d Zhao Yijian was very confident as he said this.\u2026\u2026.In another building in the Zhao sect.\u201cYufei, the preliminaries are starting tomorrow. How confident are you?\u201d A one-armed old man said as he smiled.\u201cDo not worry grandfather, I have complete confidence that no one amongst the outer disciples are my match.\u201d Zhao Yufei face gave a warm glow as she smiled.\u201cYou need only worry about Zhao Yijian. As for Zhao Yue, his forte is defense so he should not be able to threaten you.\u201d The one-armed old man analysed.\u201cZhao Yijian? Maybe.\u201d Zhao Yufei felt incredible.Being one of the sect\u2019s geniuses, there was no one who could enter her eyes. However, she did not know why that youth kept appearing in her mind\u2026..That person was not even ranked in the top ten amongst the outer disciples\u2026\u2026\u201cAlso, if you enter the finals and meet Zhao Linlong, who is ranked first, do not be stubborn. After all, he is the most powerful one amongst the Zhao sect\u2019s youths.\u201d The old man warned.\u2026\u2026\u2026At the same time, in a magnificent structure.\u201cGan\u2019er, Kun\u2019er, both of you have to perform well in this year\u2019s contest. Especially you Gan\u2019er. Your strength has reached that of a quasi martial artist. With that, you should aim for the top ten.\u201d An arrogant voice sounded.\u201cYes father! With my strength, even Zhao Yue, who is ranked first amongst the outer disciples, is not my match.\u201d Zhao Gan said casually.Zhao Kun, who was next to him said, \u201cZhao Feng! I have reached the third rank now and have trained the Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake to the first six changes. I will beat you at this contest!\u201dEven some of the elders were anticipating this contest.Countless of Zhao sect disciples were rubbing their palms together for tomorrow\u2019s fight. Everyone were waiting for the chance to change their destiny\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The morning of the next day.Just as the sky turned bright, a lot of people came into view as they gathered at the \u201cSky Martial Field\u201d, an important area of the sect. Many of those who arrived were Zhao sect disciples, and a few of them had middle or high positions in the sect.The top three outer disciples Zhao Yijian, Zhao Yue and Zhao Yufei had also arrived.Even Zhao Feng was here.This was his first time entering the Sky Martial Field.The Sky Martial Field had ten stages, all over them had a surface area of one hundred metres. As time passed the disciples that arrived increased. However, most of them were outer disciples. There were not many inner disciples that showed up.Zhao Feng did not find it weird as there would first be preliminaries. The preliminaries first started with the outer disciples. Fifty outer disciples would then face off against the other fifty inner disciples. The point of this was to eliminate the weak outer disciples, leaving just the elite behind.This meant that the inner disciples did not need to enter the preliminaries. They only had to wait for the final tournament that was half a month later.\u201dFinally, around twenty inner disciples came into view. These inner disciples had looks of interest as they looked towards the outer disciples.\u201cHehehe\u2026 There is a few, quite strong, outer disciples. I wonder how many inner disciples will be eliminated.\u201d\u201cI think only the top three have a chance at becoming inner disciples.\u201d The inner disciples discussed.\u201cLook! Zhao Qin, who is ranked fourth amongst the inner disciples, is here!\u201dThe crowd went into dead silence.She was one of the main focuses of the inner disciples. She had a clear face and a quiet attitude. As Zhao Feng inspected the girl with his left eye, he found out that she had inner strength that was weaker his own!\u201cMartial Artist\u2026.. This Zhao Qin has reached the fourth rank of the Martial Path!\u201d Zhao Feng sucked in a cold breath. Although he knew that the inner disciples had incredible talent, it was higher than he expected.If Zhao Qin, who was ranked fourth, already had a cultivation of the fourth rank, then how strong would Zhao Linlong, who was ranked first, be?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI heard that Zhao Qin\u2019s strength is only weaker than the strength of Zhao Linlong, Zhao Han and Zhao Chi, and that it is one step below the four great geniuses of Sun Feather City.\u201d\u201cFirst place Zhao Linlong, second place Zhao Chi, third place Zhao Han\u2026.. none of them are here!\u201dZhao Yue, who was first in the outer disciples, had his expression turn ugly. It was obvious that none of them felt that it was worth watching the matches of the outer disciplesTheir strength and rank had reached an unwaverable step. Maybe, they would only be seen at the final tournament.Half an hour later, a voice sounded throughout the field, \u201cThe family sparring contest starts now! Today is the preliminaries and only the outer disciples will participate. Only fifty of the five hundred and twenty two people will proceed to the final tournament!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 20": "Chapter 20Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 20 \u2013 Core Ranked Martial Art SkillThe voice sounded the official start of the family sparring contest.The field went quiet.\u201cThe first round, group elimination! The contestants will be split into ten groups, spread over the ten stages. Now we will start splitting the groups\u2026\u2026\u201dUnder the sect\u2019s guidance the outer disciples were split into ten different groups\u201cNumber 188, seventh stage!\u201dZhao Feng headed towards the seventh stage.The rule was that, in every stage, ten people would be chosen out of the fifty-ish people to proceed to the next round. For example, Zhao Feng\u2019s group had fifty two people, and only ten of them would proceed to the next round.Using his left eye, Zhao Feng scanned across the ten groups and realised that the group splitting was rigged. The most obvious was that the top ten disciples were all in different groups.For example, Zhao Yue, who was first had been sent to the first group. Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yufei, were sent into the second and third group respectively. This meant that the top disciples would not meet too early on.\u201cEvery group has an even spread of strong and weak disciples. This means that there will not be many youths that will advance through luck.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head in agreement.Next, Zhao Feng started to survey the ones that threatened him most.The strongest was Zhao Chengang, who was ranked seventh amongstthe outer disciples. Zhao Chengang stood tall as his peak of the third rank aura spread out.To be able to rank in the top ten amongst the outer disciples meant that they had their own forte. Zhao Feng was taken aback when he felt a familiar person in group seven. It was a beautiful figure clothed in white.\u201cBrother Feng.\u201d Zhao Xue said as she looked at Zhao Feng.Zhao Feng nodded in response.\u201cLittle Xue! It is alright. Brother Yijian told me to beat up Zhao Feng and make him be unable to achieve a good result.\u201d Zhao Chengang, who was ranked first out of the group, said as he walked towards Zhao Xue.\u201cYou\u2026\u2026\u2026..\u201d Zhao Xue was going to say something but stopped herself from doing so.She did not know why she did not want Zhao Feng to achieve a good result\u2026..At this time the tournament started.\u201cThirteen vs Sixty-five!\u201d\u201cForty-eight vs Three hundred and fifty-five!\u201d\u201cOne hundred and seventy-nine vs Twenty-four!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026The judges\u2019 voices sounded in each group.The first few rounds ended quickly.The judges were all from the sect and had rich experience. For those matches that were one-sided, the judges could always quickly make the correct decision.For example, Zhao Chengang defeated his opponent in one hit.\u201cOne hundred and eighty-eight vs Twenty four!\u201dIt was finally Zhao Feng\u2019s turn.Teng!His body swiftly landed on stage.Twenty four was a youth who had a cultivation of the second rank. His eyes let out fear when he realised that Zhao Feng was at the third rank.\u201cSlamming Wind Palm!\u201d The slightly fat youth bit his teeth together and attacked with all his might. The skill he used was at the middle rank and used speed to try and win.\u201cFlaming Metal Fists!\u201d Zhao Feng casually waved his fist.The moment he used his fist skill the expression of the judge on the seventh stage changed. This was because Zhao Feng was using a core rank martial art skill!Peh!As they exchanged blows they slightly fat youth was sent flying.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight wins!\u201d The judge said.Because Zhao Feng\u2019s opponent was not strong he did not receive much attention.\u201cHmph! This kid is so arrogant, using a core rank martial art!\u201d The disciples below sniggered.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight vs number sixty-six!\u201d Soon, it was Zhao Feng\u2019s time to go up again.There was a rule in each group: once one lost a total of ten matches one was eliminated. The matches would not stop until there were only ten people left.If one could win twenty matches in a row one would be promoted to the second round.Zhao Feng\u2019s second match was against a horse-faced youth who had a cultivation at the peak of the second rank.\u201cFlaming Metal Fist!\u201d Zhao Feng did not even think as he hit the vital parts of the opponent.Peh!The horse-faced youth cringed as he fell head over heels onto the ground.\u201cHe used a core rank martial art again!\u201d The Zhao sect disciples looked on disdainfully.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight wins!\u201dThis was already Zhao Feng\u2019s second victory. However, for the next two matches, Zhao Feng still used the core rank martial art.Four wins in a row!\u201cThis brat\u2019s way too arrogant! Does he think he is unbeatable by using a core rank martial art?\u201d\u201cHmph! His opponents aren\u2019t even strong! Once he faces someone of the same rank it won\u2019t be that easy!\u201d The disciples below sniggered.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight vs number forty-seven!\u201d Finally, at the fifth round, Zhao Feng\u2019s opponent was someone of the third rank, who was also ranked in the top five in his group.\u201cZhao Kui! Beat that kid!\u201d Someone shouted. Many were already dissatisfied were Zhao Feng.\u201cKid, this is as far as you go.\u201d Zhao Kui\u2019s muscular body stood in front. His immense strength was all compacted in his muscles. He normally just had to stand there and the second rankers would admit defeat due to the pressure.There were a total of around sixty people who had reached the third rank amongst the outer disciples. Therefore, a third rank was considered to be powerful in the groups.\u201cUse all of your skills.\u201d Zhao Feng faintly smiled, he did not put normal third rankers in his eyes.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026 if you\u2019ve got guts keep on using that core rank martial art!\u201d Zhao Kui laughed and, like a lion, pounced towards Zhao Feng.\u201cLion King\u2019s Anger!\u201d Zhao Kui compacted all of his strength into his body. Most peak third rankers would not even face him off.\u201cHehe not bad! See if you can block my move, Flaming Metal Fist!\u201d Zhao Feng actually still used core level martial arts!Flaming Metal Fist again? The disciples watching almost fainted.Hu!A loud thump sounded from the seventh stage and a scream soon followed.Boom!Zhao Kui\u2019s massive body laid on the ground, a few of his teeth were also broken.What!? The crowd below stared at this scene.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight wins!\u201d Even the judge felt that it was unbelievable. He again won with a core rank martial art!Five wins in a row!This was slapping the disciples\u2019 faces on purpose.\u201cCore rank martial art\u2026. How is this possible\u2026\u2026\u2026.?\u201d Zhao Kui walked off stage, his face green.After beating Zhao Kui, Zhao Feng\u2019s matches became easier.Five wins\u2026\u2026 Six wins\u2026\u2026 Seven wins in a row!Later on, all those under the third rank admitted defeat when they saw him. The only other person with the same record as him in group seven was Zhao Chengang.\u201cIt looks like this kid had trained the core ranked martial art to the peak level, no wonder it is so powerful. Hehe wait until you meet me, then I\u2019ll let you have a taste of high level martial art skills\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Chengang laughed coldly.Up to now Zhao Feng and Zhao Chengang had become known as the \u201cDuo Eagles\u201d of the seventh stage, as they both had not lost one match yet.Seven wins\u2026.. Eight wins\u2026\u2026.. Nine wins\u2026\u2026 Ten wins in a row!\u201cWho do you think is stronger? Zhao Feng or Zhao Chengang?\u201d\u201cI think Zhao Chengang is a bit stronger, but Zhao Feng is not weak either, he is a black horse.\u201dThey had two people with the same streak unlike the other groups where there was just a single dominant figure.For example, all the opponents Zhao Yue and Zhao Yijian faced, they all admitted defeat.Zhao Yijian\u2019s strength was too powerful. Every move he took could kill his opponent. Only group seven had the \u201cDuo Eagles\u201d title. Many were excited and looked forward to the clash between Zhao Feng and Zhao Chengang.In Zhao Feng\u2019s twelfth match, he met a familiar person.It was Zhao Xue!This was an awkward opponent.\u201cLittle Xue, admit defeat.\u201d Zhao Feng said calmly.Zhao Xue had barely managed to reach the peak of the second rank, she obviously wasn\u2019t his match.Even Zhao Yijian, who was in group two, looked over to see what was going on.\u201cAdmit defeat? Never!\u201d Zhao Xue bit her teeth as her face turned stubborn. She would never allow herself to admit defeat in front of Zhao Feng.When they were at Green Leaf Village, Zhao Xue had loved Zhao Feng, thinking he was the most talented youth there was. However, after entering Sun Feather City she realised that Green Leaf Village was tiny in comparison\u2026\u2026Being a weak woman, she could not adapt to the cruel new environment, so she made a hard decision \u2013 to climb onto Zhao Yijian who was ranked third. Zhao Xue would never allow herself to admit defeat to her first love that she then threw away.\u201cFine!\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head helplessly.\u201cFloating Wind Hand!\u201d Zhao Xue was like a wind that merged into that palm and came straight towards Zhao Feng\u2019s head. [Floating Wind Hand] was a martial art skill at the peak of the middle rank and was suitable for women as it used softness to break hardness.In terms of martial art skill rank, [Floating Wind Hand] was the same as as [Angry Dragon Fists], but it could restrain the latter from using its fullest potential, like how it could restrain [Flaming Metal Fists] as well.\u201cFlaming Metal Fist!\u201d Zhao Feng did not move and simply threw out a punch.Pah!The fist and palm intertwined together.Suddenly Zhao Xue groaned and started to fall.Ai!Zhao Feng gently sighed and tried to help Zhao Xue stabilize. After all\u2026.. They had grown up together and he could not bear to see her being injured.\u201cPointed Wind Finger!\u201d The moment Zhao Feng held Zhao Xue, the latter\u2019s eyes flashed coldly and her jade-like fingers sliced at Zhao Feng\u2019s chest.This scene caused many disciples to scream in fear. At such a close distance, Zhao Feng could not dodge at all.\u201cHmph!\u201d Zhao Feng expression turned angry and his body suddenly burst with power, sending Zhao Xue flying.Plop!Zhao Xue screamed and spat out a mouthful of blood as she landed on the ground.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight wins.\u201d The judge said while looking disdainfully at Zhao Xue. It was obvious Zhao Xue\u2019s actions did not please him.\u201cXue\u2019er!\u201d Zhao Yijian came running over.Zhao Feng coldly walked down the stage. He never thought that Zhao Xue would attack him under those conditions.\u201cKid\u2026.. we\u2019ll meet later on! I\u2019ll give you a personal experience of shame!\u201d Zhao Yijian coldly said.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting.\u201d Zhao Feng turned and left without bothering to look at Zhao Xue.He then heard Zhao Xue say in the background, \u201cBrother Jian you have got to take revenge for me\u2026..\u201dAfter beating Zhao Xue, Zhao Feng had won twelve matches.Twelve wins\u2026.. Thirteen wins\u2026\u2026 Fourteen wins in a row!Zhao Feng\u2019s record steadily increased.His core ranked fist skill wiped out everyone at the seventh stage. Only \u201cZhao Chengang\u201d in the seventh stage had the same record as him.\u201cThere are still six matches left until I can enter the next round.\u201dHowever, at the fifteenth round, Zhao Feng met Zhao Chengang who was ranked first in the group. The Duo Eagles were now facing each other! The atmosphere had reached a climax on the seventh stage!\u201cThey are finally meeting each other!\u201d The disciples of the seventh stage let out a deep breath as they became excited. Even some of the contestants from the other stages looked anticipatedly over at the seventh stage.The judge of the seventh stage let out a smile.\u201cKid, I\u2019ve finally met you. If you\u2019ve got skill then keep using your core rankfist skill.\u201d Zhao Chengang licked his lips as his eyes showed a tinge of playfulness.In terms of strength Zhao Chengang was ranked in the top ten amongst the outer disciples and had learnt high ranked martial arts, which were three ranks higher than core rank martial arts.\u201cWhy not? I will keep on using my core rank fist skill.\u201d Zhao Feng said calmly.What! He is still going to use the core rank fist skill? The crowd was filled of cold breaths.\u201cDid this kid eat the wrong medicine?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWay too arrogant! Does he think that, just by using a core rank fist skill alone, he can beat the whole group?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u201cStill\u2026.. Still using a core rank fist skill?\u201dThe judge\u2019s face twitched. Even from the judge\u2019s point of view, he thought that Zhao Feng was being way too arrogant!Being the opponent, Zhao Chengang\u2019s smile froze, it was as if he had been slapped\u2026\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 21": "Chapter 21Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 21 \u2013 Max levelObviously, Zhao Feng\u2019s words caused an outrage. Especially in the seventh group, almost all of them hated Zhao Feng.\u201cHmph! This guy is way too arrogant.\u201d\u201cZhao Chengang! Take him down!\u201dThe disturbance caused others to look over.\u201cCore rank martial art? That is a bit interesting.\u201d A quiet girl smiled as she looked on interestingly. She was Zhao Qin, who was ranked fourth amongst the inner disciples.Being an inner disciple, Zhao Qin did not need to enter the preliminaries. With her cultivation she could beat everyone present. Even when compared to Zhao Yue their difference was to big.\u201cFine\u2026. Fine\u2026. Fine! I will see\u2026.. how strong your core ranked martial art is!\u201d Zhao Chengang\u2019s face was deadly. The opponent\u2019s performance was slapping his face!\u201cFlowing Wind Fist!\u201d Zhao Chengang pushed down his anger and used the high rank skill Flowing Wind Fist.This fist skill used strength and speed to overpower the opponent. Its attack was like a raging storm.Zhao Chengang\u2019s strength was well within the crowd\u2019s expectations. His power was approaching that of a Quasi Martial Artist and did not disappoint. However, most of them were more focused on Zhao Feng. Facing the outer disciples ranked seventh, would he still use core rank martial arts?Zhao Feng used his actions to prove what he said.\u201cFlaming Metal Fist!\u201d The simple punch gave off a red glow.It was core martial arts again!\u201cIt is Flaming Metal Fist again!\u201d\u201cHe is still using core rank martial arts?\u201d The Zhao sect disciples were shocked. A lot of them had thought that Zhao Feng was just joking, and that he wasn\u2019t going to do it.However, the truth was, he was even crazier than expected!\u201cKid, fall!\u201d Zhao Chengang\u2019s eyes looked as they could spit out fire as his two fists came crushing towards Zhao Feng. The power contained inside his fists made many Zhao sect disciples shout out.\u201cNormal third rank cultivators won\u2019t even be able to take this one punches.\u201d\u201cNot bad, Flowing Wind Fists has reached the low level, it is obvious that he has trained hard!\u201d Even some of the older generation nodded their head.Peh!The two figures clashed together, fist against fist.\u201cGo down!\u201d Zhao Chengang pushed his Flowing Wind Fist to the max. If he used a high rank martial art and couldn\u2019t take down Zhao Feng in two or three moves, then how would he be able to get a foot in amongst the top ten outer disciples?\u201cOpen!\u201d Zhao Feng was calm. His fists seemed to be alive and easily blocked Zhao Chengang\u2019s fist.Boom!The burn on Zhao Chengang\u2019s fist made his fist go numb as hewas pushed back two steps, while Zhao Feng only trembled but did not move.\u201c\u2026\u2026. How is this possible?\u201d Zhao Chengang was shocked. He had thought that he could take down Zhao Feng in one punch, but in reality, he was casually blocked by a core ranked martial art!\u201cWhat is going on!\u201d The Zhao sect disciple around paused.\u201cI do not believe it\u2026\u2026 it was an accident! It accidentally hit the weakness of my move.\u201d Zhao Chengang howled as he again pounced towards using Flowing Wind Fist.Pah!Once again Zhao Chengang was pushed back. Although the first two moves were even, Zhao Chengang was being constrained.\u201cIt really is a core martial art skill\u2026.. How did he do that?\u201d\u201cHow can a core rank martial art gain the upper hand while facing a high rank martial art?\u201dThe Zhao sect disciples were confused.One move\u2026. Two moves\u2026. Three moves\u2026..Every time, Zhao Chengang was pushed back.When two people of the same rank fought it was normal to have one side gain the upper hand. However, using a core rank martial art while fighting against a high rank martial art was unheard of.What was going on?Zhao Chengang turned crazy as he used all of his power.Many looked towards the judge and the older generation of the sect.\u201cZhao Feng\u2019s battle conscience and skill far surpasses Zhao Chengang\u2019s.\u201d The judge said uncertainly. His analysis didn\u2019t satisfy the people.\u201cHehe, this kid has trained a core ranked skill to the \u2018max level\u2019.\u201d An old voice sounded from the centre of the crowd. It was an old man who had a white beard. It was this contest\u2019s main judge.Max level?A few judges quickly nodded their heads. Everyone knew that the higher the skill level, the more damage was dealt. However, this was not the case for everything!For example, when one trained a low rank martial art to the high level, and another trained a high rank skill to the low level, the high rank martial art would not be as powerful as the low rank martial art.Normally, the levels were: Beginner, low, high and peak level.Peak level meant that it had reached ninety percent or higher.Normally, someone training a martial art to the peak level was already very rare. However, peak level did not mean that it was the limit. Above peak level was the max level!Max level meant that the skill had been trained to at least ninety-nine percent of its fullest potential. It could be said that it was \u2018perfect\u2019.\u201cAlthough it seems like there is a small difference between the max level and the peak level, the gap is insanely huge! The difference is even bigger than the difference between the low level and the high level!\u201d The main judge smiled faintly.\u201cBut even so, Zhao Feng should only be able to fight on par against Zhao Chengang.\u201d One martial artist still did not understand.After all, high ranked martial art skills were three levels higher than core ranked martial art skills, and Zhao Chengang had trained the high rank martial art to the low level.\u201cYou are right! The max level of a core rank martial art can barely fight on par with the low level of a high rank martial art. But as you can see, Zhao Feng\u2019s body strength, reaction speed, battle conscience etc all far exceeds that of Zhao Chengang\u2019s.\u201dThe main judge praised. Through his explanation the crowd now fully understood.Just at this moment, the battle on the seventh stage was changing.\u201cZhao Feng\u2019s starting to attack now!\u201d\u201cOh my god! What a fast speed!\u201dPeh! Pah! Beng\u2026..The audience\u2019s eyes were attracted by the seventh stage, only to see Zhao Feng\u2019s defense turn into offense. His fists had already surpassed the realm of what Flaming Metal Fists could achieve.His speed, power, all struck at the opponent\u2019s weaknesses. Zhao Chengang, who was in a frenzied state, instantly fumbled and got hit by one of Zhao Feng\u2019s punches.Pah\u2014Zhao Chengang gave a scream as his shoulder was ripped out of its socket.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight wins!\u201d The judge of the seventh said as he let out a breath.Hua!The seventh group went into an uproar.\u201cZhao Feng beat Zhao Chengang by only using a core ranked martial art!\u201d\u201cUnbelievable! Zhao Chengang was ranked first in the group\u2026\u2026.\u201dZhao Feng won had won his fifteenth match. This meant that he was now the strongest in group seven.At this moment Zhao Yue, Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yufei all looked over.\u201cMax level? When the martial artist held the lecture, I felt all the moves of Flaming Metal Fist disappear from my mind\u2026.. This is probably why.\u201d Zhao Feng understood.When he came back from the lecture he felt that his core ranked martial art had reached a peak, where it could fight against quasi martial artists. And Zhao Chengang\u2019s strength had only barely reached that of a quasi martial artist.\u201cNot bad. It looks like the outer disciples have a black horse.\u201d The main judge smiled.\u201cCore rank martial art\u2026. Although he has trained it to the max level, he will still lose against my son Zhao Yijian. After all, core ranked martial arts are just core ranked!\u201d A middle-aged man faintly smiled.\u201cOh?\u201d The main judge sent an interested look towards the middle-aged man.The middle-aged man was Zhao Yijian\u2019s father. The middle-aged man laughed as his eyes glanced towards Zhao Yijian with a confident expression.\u201cTrue\u2026. The potential of core ranked martial arts are limited\u2026. Zhao Feng must have spent a lot of time and effort to train it to the max level, which means that he would not have much time left to train in other skills\u2026.. So unfortunate.\u201d As the main judge spoke up to here, he shook his head.\u201cHmph! Max level of a core ranked martial art?\u201d Zhao Yijian looked mockingly at Zhao Feng. In his eyes, core ranked martial arts were rubbish.The white-clothed girl looked shockingly at Zhao Feng, \u201cBrother Yijian, you have got to beat him.\u201d\u201cXue\u2019er, it is fine. I only need three to ten moves at most! But I won\u2019t let him off the hook that easily, I am also going to humiliate him.\u201d Zhao Yijian said confidently. His voice was very loud so many of the people present heard it.At this time, Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes landed upon them.Their four eyes met. While Zhao Yijian\u2019s eyes were cold, Zhao Feng had a faint smile on.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight vs number two hundred and thirty-three!\u201dThe group contest still continued.After Zhao Feng beat Zhao Chengang he had no more opponents that were his match on the seventh stage.Sixteen wins\u2026.. Seventeen wins\u2026.. Eighteen wins\u2026\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euMost of the people Zhao Feng met admitted defeat. And those who had the courage to fight, they were finished in one fist.\u201cIt is too disgraceful to lose against a core ranked martial art!\u201dThe Zhao sect disciples looked at Zhao Feng like he had a disease.Eighteen wins\u2026. Nineteen wins\u2026\u2026 Twenty wins in a row!Finally Zhao Feng won twenty matches in a row, allowing him to proceed to the next round!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 22": "Chapter 22Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 22 \u2013 Birth of the Black HorseHu!Zhao Feng let out a breath as he sat down.Zhao Feng was a black horse that appeared in the in the group contest. Using just his core ranked martial arts he had beat everyone in his way.Even Zhao Chengang, who was ranked seventh amongst the outer disciples, had lost.\u201cI wonder how the other groups are going.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes scanned across the other group. The preliminaries was split into ten different group, with each group having a fair mix of strong and weak disciples.Apart from Zhao Feng there were many others who had won twenty matches in a row, so they were also able to advance straight into the next round. The fastest of them was Zhao Yijian from the second group.Zhao Yijian\u2019s sword was extremely fast, before his opponents could react it had reached their throats. In terms of speed to enter the next round, Zhao Yijian was even faster than Zhao Yue.\u201cAmongst the outer disciples, only the top three, Zhao Yufei, Zhao Yue and Zhao Yijian, are able to threaten me.\u201dZhao Yue\u2019s age was slightly higher, seventeen years old, and his muscular body seemed extremely big.\u201cReverse Wind Fist!\u201d One disciple of the third rank punched Zhao Yue, but the latter did not even move.What!?The disciple\u2019s forehead started to sweat.What defense!Zhao Feng was slightly shocked. The full attack of a third rank could not even injure Zhao Yue a little bit. Zhao Yue must have trained in a high rank body strengthening skill to allow his defense surpass the damage dealt by the same rank.At least Zhao Feng could not take on the blows from a third rank cultivator with just his body.If Zhao Yijian was said to be fast and explosive, then Zhao Yue was the opposite. He was slow and his defense was impenetrable.Zhao Yufei used softness to beat hardness. She would casually wave her hand and defeat the opponent. Every move of hers seemed flawless. She wore a purple robe and her beauty was outstanding. Those that watched her had a refreshing feel.\u201cWho is she? To have the strength of a quasi martial artist at such a young age.\u201d Even a few of the inner disciples were attracted by Zhao Yufei.\u201cShe\u2019s beautiful and talented at the same time. When people like her enter the inner disciples, we won\u2019t even have a chance.\u201d\u201cShe is still too young. Another two years and she might be able to be compared with Sun Feather City\u2019s most beautiful girl, Qiu Mengyu.\u201d\u2026\u2026.Up to a certain point, more people focused on her rather than Zhao Yue and Zhao Yijian, who were first and second. This was mainly due to her beauty and talent.Soon the ten groups each had a person win twenty matches in a row. The first group was Zhao Yue, second group Zhao Yijian, third group Zhao Yufei, fourth group Zhao Gan, fifth group Zhao Guang\u2026\u2026They were all ranked amongst the top ten outer disciples.However, there was one unexpected person from group seven. Zhao Feng was a black horse that rushed out and took Zhao Chengang\u2019s spot.Apart from these ten people, not many others won twenty matches in a row.The group contests kept on running until there were ten people left in each group. Using one days time, there was now a total of one hundred disciples left. These one hundred were the elite of the outer disciples.The second day the one hundred people once again met at the Sky Martial Field.Having rested for one night, Zhao Feng felt very energetic. He found that these matches had helped increase his cultivation to a certain extent.\u201cToday we will entering the second round of elimination! All of you are the elites of the outer disciples, but today, half of you will be eliminated, leaving fifty of you to enter the final tournament! Here are the rules\u2026\u2026\u201d A voice sounded throughout the field.The one hundred contestants held their breaths as they listened to the rules.The ranking was done by gaining points, everyone started with one point and every match they won would increase their point\u2019s by one, with every loss one point would be deducted.Finally, the fifty people with the most points would fight against the inner disciples.\u201cStart!\u201d The judge\u2019s voice sounded.\u201cNumber one hundred and forty-four vs number twenty-six!\u2019\u201cNumber seventy-three vs number four hundred and twenty-nine!\u201dThe ten different stages all had matches going on.Many would admit defeat if they saw that their opponent was too strong. For examples Zhao Yue and Zhao Yijian, their opponents admitted defeat as soon as they saw them. They would rather conserve their strength for the next round.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight vs number one hundred and sixty-nine!\u201dFinally it was Zhao Feng\u2019s turn. His opponent was a black-faced youth of the second rank.\u201cI admit defeat!\u201d The black-faced youth saw that it was Zhao Feng so he immediately surrendered.Zhao Feng was slightly stunned.The black-faced youth had been in the same group as Zhao Feng during the first round, but they never exchanged blows.Like this, Zhao Feng gained his first point and his tally went up to two.Soon Zhao Feng met his second opponent. This time his opponent was a girl of the second rank.\u201cI know your strength is strong but I will not admit defeat.\u201d The simple clothed girl bit her teeth.Facing these type of weak woman, some would let her win on purpose.\u201cFlaming Metal Fist!\u201dThe simple punch once again came and knocked the girl six metres back. One move, swift and simple!Zhao Feng did not want to waste time as the opponent was too weak and would not help him improve.I lost! The girl felt disappointed as she walked off.\u201cHmph! Bullying weak girls, what is so cool about that?\u201d\u201cWait till I go on, I will take revenge for sister Xin!\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s actions caused some youths to look at him in disdain.\u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight wins!\u201d The judge looked praisingly at Zhao Feng.The next matches were too easy. Zhao Feng\u2019s points continued to rise.\u201cI give up!\u201d\u201cI admit defeat!\u201d\u201cFlaming Metal Fist!\u201dMost of Zhao Feng\u2019s opponents gave up, but the ones who didn\u2019t lost instantly.\u201cThis kid\u2019s strength has probably reached the quasi martial artist rank.\u201dAs more matches went on, more and more people started to understand his strength.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t forget to pay attention to Zhao Yue and Zhao Yijian.At one time, on the third stage.\u201cQuick! Look! It is Zhao Yijian vs Zhao Gan!\u201dZhao Feng turned to see the two were already exchanging blows.The second and fourth strongest outer disciple fighting easily gained the crowd\u2019s attention. These two people were both ranked amongst the top five and originally their strength did not have much difference.\u201cTenth change of the poisonous snake!\u201d Zhao Gan shouted as he twisted and twirled on the ground like a snake. He was so agile that he managed to dodge Zhao Yijian\u2019s sword many times.Zhao Feng was slightly moved as Zhao Gan\u2019s strength had increased a lot since their encounter last month. He had also trained the Thirteen Changes of the Poisonous Snake to the tenth change, which meant that he now had the strength of a quasi martial artist.Zhao Gan\u2019s strength was on par with Xin Fei from Sky Cloud Forest.\u201cAlthough you have improved a lot, you will still lose to me like you used to.\u201d Zhao Yijian as he increased his speed once more.\u201cIt is the high rank skill Ice Flowing Sword! This is an extremely hard skill to train!\u201d Someone called out.Zhao Yijian\u2019s sword became faster and faster.Zhao Gan was able to dodge at first but as time passed he was able to dodge less and less. Soon a few slash marks appeared on Zhao Gan\u2019s body.\u201cZhao Yijian wins!\u201d The judge stopped the fight as they wanted Zhao Gan to proceed to the next round as well without being too injured.At this time, Zhao Gan\u2019s back was full of cold sweat as he looked incredulously at Zhao Yijian, \u201cHow did you do this\u2026..?\u201dZhao Yijian used less than ten moves to beat Zhao Gan.\u201cZhao Yijian\u2019s strength is so strong!\u201d One of the Zhao sect disciples exclaimed.Zhao Yijian and Zhao Gan did spar before, but at that time the fight lasted for a long time, with them exchanging over one-hundred blows, but now he only needed ten!\u201cZhao Yijian\u2019s strength can probably be compared to Zhao Yue now.\u201d A few guessed.Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yue. One\u2019s forte was attack while the other\u2019s was defense.What would happen if these two met?Many were waiting for the clash\u2026..Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yue were the two hot picks for the title of \u201cStrongest outer disciple\u201d.Zhao Yufei had not lost either.Zhao Feng\u2019s face remained calm as he looked on. He had now won forty-four matches in a row. However at this time he met a powerful opponent. It was the fifth ranked outer disciple, Zhao Guang!Zhao Guang had over forty points as well and the only match he had lost was against Zhao Yue.\u201cHehe, kid! Your streak ends here!\u201d Zhao Guang laughed happily.Many looked gloatingly towards Zhao Feng.Fifth rank Zhao Guang was the strongest opponent he had faced so far.\u201cYour strength barely steps into the quasi martial artist rank.\u201d Zhao Feng said calmly.\u201cReally? Then I\u2019ll have a taste of what skills you have apart from the core ranked martial arts.\u201d Zhao Guang\u2019s eyes flashed.Shua!As soon as he finished his words he moved to Zhao Feng\u2019s side.\u201cWhat speed!\u201d\u201cZhao Guang and Zhao Yufei are both known for their footwork.\u201dZhao Guang\u2019s speed caused many praises from the crowd.A contest of speed? Zhao Feng\u2019s looked mockingly at Zhao Guang.Shua!When Zhao Guang\u2019s palm was just about to hit Zhao Feng, the target disappeared from under his eyes! It was as if his palm split Zhao Feng into the air.\u201cNot good\u2026..\u201d Zhao Guang thought.Hua!The disciples below stared at the scene. Many who reacted fast stared behind Zhao Guang.Angry Dragon Fists!Zhao Guang only felt something come towards his back.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPah!Zhao Guang instinctively tried to block the blow, and managed to do so, but then he felt a raging strength overpower him.Boom\u2014\u2014Zhao Guang felt back a few metres and almost fell.\u201cWhat skill did he learn for his speed to be so fast!\u201d Zhao Guang\u2019s heart rippled with shock.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In terms of speed, he had complete confidence that even some of the fourth rank cultivators would be unable to beat him.At this point, the battle between Zhao Feng and Zhao Guang was the focus of the entire crowd.\u201cHis speed is even faster than Zhao Guang!\u201d The top three outer disciples were stunned.\u201cWhat a beautiful footwork skill!\u201d The elders watching were also shocked.\u201cHis skill is so familiar.\u201d The main judge murmured.\u201cHe has learnt Lightly Floating Ferry! I am sure!\u201d One martial artist looked complexly at Zhao Feng. This martial artist had once learnt Lightly Floating Ferry. However, it was too hard to train in Lightly Floating Ferry, even though it was only one part of the skill, so he had only trained in it for two years before giving up.\u201cIt is Lightly Floating Ferry!\u201d\u201cTo be able to train Lightly Floating Ferry to such a high degree means that his understanding is not bad\u2026\u2026\u201dAlthough Lightly Floating Ferry was a high rank skill, it was a broken skill so its potential was limited.\u201cZhao Feng\u2019s attacking!\u201dZhao Feng was like the wind, his speed was just too fast. Zhao Guang used all of his strength but still could not dodge Zhao Feng\u2019s attacks.\u201cThe fifth stance of the Angry Dragon!\u201dAngry Dragon Fists was very popular amongst the middle ranked martial art skills so it was easily recognised.Peh! Pah! Beng\u2026\u2026.Zhao Feng pressured towards Zhao Guang. Zhao Guang felt as if he couldn\u2019t breath as the pressure was too strong. Every punch would make him fall back. He was completely being dominated by Zhao Feng.In terms of speed, Zhao Feng easily surpassed him. In terms of power, Zhao Feng also exceeded him.Wah!After blocking the eighth punch, Zhao Guang spat out a mouthful of blood and surrendered. Zhao Guang, who was ranked fifth, had lost in ten moves.Although they knew Zhao Feng was strong, and could challenge the top five, the result astonished them. Zhao Feng\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t any weaker than Zhao Yue and company.\u201cThis kid\u2019s intelligence is very high. Not only did he train a core rank martial art to the max level, he\u2019s also trained Angry Dragon Fists to the peak level.\u201d\u201cHe could beat Zhao Guang just by relying on his peak level, middle ranked martial art skill.\u201d The elders praised Zhao Feng.The matches continued.There were only four people who had straight wins: Zhao Yue, Zhao Yijian, Zhao Yufei and Zhao Feng. These four were known as the \u201cFour Strong\u201d.\u201cZhao Feng! Zhao Feng!\u201d The crowd cheered as Zhao Feng went on stage. Every time he went on, most opponents admitted defeat, or were defeated in under three moves.Zhao Feng even met Zhao Kun.\u201cI give up!\u201d Zhao Kun bit his teeth and wanted to dig a hole to hide in it.Zhao Feng\u2019s strength had already surpassed his brother\u2019s, how would he win?The Four Strong continued to dominate their matches. Many were in anticipation for when the Four Strong would clash\u2026\u2026Finally, after sixty wins, Zhao Yue, who was ranked first, faced off against Zhao Yijian, who was ranked second.\u201cZhao Yue! Zhao Yue!\u201d\u201cZhao Yijian! Zhao Yijian!\u201dMany people screamed due to the anticipation.\u201cZhao Yue! Since the battle I lost to you half a year ago, we finally meet again!\u201d Zhao Yijian was full of fighting will.In the outer disciples, Zhao Yue was very low key. All he did was cultivate everyday and therefore, his foundation was the most solid, allowing him to constantly sit on the number one seat.\u201cMake your move, we will see if your Cold Flowing Sword is stronger than my Metal Body.\u201d Zhao Yue\u2019s height towered over Zhao Yijian.Jiang!Zhao Yijian took his sword out of its sheath.The moment Cold Flowing Sword was used, the air felt like it was freezing.\u201cMetal Palm!\u201d Zhao Yue\u2019s body stood tall as his fist punched towards the sword.Peng!The explosion made the eardrums of lower level cultivators tremble.Zhao Yijian moved back two steps then spun around to stab at Zhao Yue\u2019s lower body.\u201cOne of them is defensive while the other is offensive.\u201dIt was obvious that the strength that Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yue showed could easily beat quasi martial artists.If Zhao Feng didn\u2019t form inner strength then he wouldn\u2019t be able to break through Zhao Yue\u2019s defenses.Ding! Ding! Beng\u2026..Zhao Yue and Zhao Yijian\u2019s fight went into red hot mode. Zhao Yijian\u2019s sword became faster and faster. The ice cold air enveloped Zhao Yue\u2019s body.Zhao Yue continued to block Zhao Yijian\u2019s sword.If it was another third rank instead of Zhao Yue they would have been finished in one move.\u201cZhao Yue\u2019s foundation is very solid and his forte is defense. If Zhao Yijian cannot win in half the time it take tea to boil then he will not win.\u201d The main judge said.\u201cHehe, half the time it takes for tea to boil? He will not need that long.\u201d The middle-aged man, who was Zhao Yijian\u2019s father said confidently.\u201cOh?\u201d The main judge\u2019s expression changed.At this moment, the battle suddenly changed.Hu!Zhao Yue groaned as his arm was cut.\u2018How could my Metal Body be broken\u2026..?\u201d Zhao Yue\u2019s face turned white.Metal Body was a skill that made one\u2019s body turn as tough as metal. Accompanied with Metal Fists, his strength and defense had reached a limit. He believed that no one under the fourth rank could penetrate his defense.\u201cHigh level of a high rank martial art skill!\u201d The judge shouted.High level of a high rank martial art?The disciples nearby sucked in a cold breath.For most high ranked martial arts, it was already hard enough to train them to the low level, and to train one to the high level, was many times harder.However, once it reached the high level, the damage of the skill would be fifty percent higher than what it was at the low level.Flowing Cold Sword was already a terrifying high rank offense skill. When someone of the third rank trained it to the low level, one could have the strength of a quasi martial artist. If one trained it to the high level, it could threaten martial artists.\u201cHigh level of a high rank martial art! No wonder! Congratulations Zhao Tianjian, for having such a talented son.\u201d The main judge smiled towards the middle aged man. Zhao Tianjian was Zhao Yijian\u2019s father.\u201cThank you elder!\u201d Zhao Tianjian was shocked as the main judge was an elder, which meant that his status was far higher than his own.On the stage.\u201cIce Cold Flash!\u201dZhao Yijian pushed the sword to an even faster speed.Fssssh!Zhao Yue\u2019s shirt was ripped into pieces as his body was cut multiple times.\u201cZhao Yijian wins!\u201d The judge immediately said.\u201cHigh level of a high rank martial art. I did not lost unjustly.\u201d Zhao Yue said as he sighed.After defeating Zhao Yue, Zhao Yijian\u2019s momentum couldn\u2019t be stopped.\u201cZhao Yijian! Zhao Yijian!\u201dThe crowd belows cheered. Many youths looked up in awe to him. Zhao Yijian was now the king of the outer disciples.Zhao Yijian surveyed the area and his eyes landed on Zhao Feng. His lips curled into a cold smile as he looked disdainfully at Zhao Feng.\u201cBrother Jian!\u201d Zhao Xue who\u2019s face was fully red ran up to him. She believed that his strength was unbeatable. At the same time, she glanced towards Zhao Feng.Zhao Feng was expressionless.Now there were only three people left with a perfect record, Zhao Yijian, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei. However, now there was not much anticipation left.In the crowd\u2019s opinion, Zhao Yijian would not lose to anyone from the outer disciples. He would even be ranked highly amongst the inner disciples!\u201cHigh level of a high rank martial art?\u201d Zhao Feng murmured.His perfect record kept on escalating and soon reached sixty wins\u2026. Sixty-one wins\u2026.However, the fight between Zhao Yijian and Zhao Feng could not be avoided.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFinally, at his sixty-ninth match, Zhao Feng saw the purple-clothed youth stand on stage.It was Zhao Yijian!The crowd turned silent as the two faced each other. After all, Zhao Feng had a perfect record as well.\u201cZhao Feng! You won\u2019t admit defeat will you?\u201d Zhao Yijian mockingly said.In his opinion, the only one who was his opponent was Zhao Yue, all the others were rubbish.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Although Zhao Yijian was strong, he had an arrogant attitude. This meant that it was useless to talk to him. Only with actions could you prove what you wanted to say.Although Zhao Feng did not respond, his attitude was like needles in Zhao Yijian\u2019s eyes.The crowd was slightly taken aback. Zhao Yijian was already very arrogant, but Zhao Feng\u2019s \u2018silence\u2019 did more than what words could say.\u201cKid, if you don\u2019t speak now, you won\u2019t be able to speak later.\u201d Zhao Yijian said deeply.Jiang!His sword flashed in front of Zhao Feng.Zhao Yijian started with Cold Flowing Sword. Although he was very arrogant, he knew that Zhao Feng had the strength of a quasi martial artist so he had to go full out.Zhao Feng felt a chill coming from the sword.Ssssss!The sword missed Zhao Feng\u2019s shoulder by half an inch.\u201cWhat a high technique! I can only see the after-image!\u201dIf he only had the strength of a quasi martial artist, then he definitely wouldn\u2019t be able to face the high level of Cold Flowing Sword.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t think that his defense would exceed Zhao Yue\u2019s.Ceng!As light as a leaf, Zhao Feng pulled away from Zhao Yijian.In terms of offense, Zhao Feng was not Zhao Yijian\u2019s match, not unless he learned a high rank body strengthening technique like Zhao Yue.\u201cWhere are you running!\u201d Zhao Yijian swiftly jumped and used Cold Flowing Sword in mid-air.No matter how hard Zhao Feng tried to dodge, the chill continued to follow him.\u201cNo wonder it is the high level of a high ranked martial art!\u201d Zhao Feng thought, he knew that although his Angry Dragon Fists had reached the peak level, it was not a match for Zhao Yijian\u2019s Cold Flowing Sword.\u201cIce Cold Flying Explosion!\u201dZhao Yijian\u2019s move suddenly changed. The sword turned towards Zhao Feng\u2019s landing spot.Not good!Zhao Feng was in midair and once he landed, he would not be able to dodge Zhao Yijian\u2019s area attack.\u201cWhat a Cold Flowing Sword! He can already use area attacks while still below the fourth rank!\u201d\u201cLooks like the battle has been decided!\u201d The older generation, who were watching, praised.\u201cCome down!\u201d Zhao Yijian\u2019s Ice Cold Flying Explosion sent a chaotic blast towards the lower part of Zhao Feng\u2019s body.\u201cLightly Floating Wave!\u201d Zhao Feng took a deep breath as he compacted all of his blood, allowing for him to jump in midair.Teng!His body left the pull of gravity as jumped over Zhao Yijian\u2019s killing move.How\u2026.. is this possible?Zhao Yijian stood dazed as he saw Zhao Feng \u2018jump\u2019 over his killing move.\u201cWhat! Zhao Feng has trained Lightly Floating Ferry to such a high degree!\u201d The main judge praised as he stroked his beard.\u201cLightly Floating Wave! That is the ultimate move of Lightly Floating Ferry, how did he manage to do this?\u201d The martial artist who had once trained in Lightly Floating Ferry exclaimed as he stood up from shock.On the stage.Zhao Feng was running while Zhao Yijian tried to catch up. Soon, Zhao Yijian\u2019s Cold Flowing Sword was approaching the high level, its damage and speed rapidly increasing.Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t bad either. His Lightly Floating Ferry made him as light as a feather and although it seemed like he could only barely dodge the sword, the sword did not even touch him once.\u201dTime passed slowly.While Zhao Feng was running, he tried to find any flaws in Zhao Yijian\u2019s skill so that he could retaliate.However, he suddenly realised that he could not even get close to Zhao Yijian, or else he would face a killing move. His Angry Dragon Fists could not even block one of Zhao Yijian\u2019s sword blows.If he tried to block one, he would get injured.\u201cDo I have to use\u2026..\u201d Zhao Feng sucked in a breath as the inner strength in his body awakened, then disappeared.Relying on the Hiding Air Technique, he concealed his inner strength.While in midair, Zhao Feng suddenly put his energy into his left eye.Peh! Peh!The moment the left eye was activated, Zhao Feng went into super-vision mode.Although Zhao Yijian\u2019s sword was fast, it slowed down in his eyes.He could even see where the strength in Zhao Yijian\u2019s body gathered, and through that, Zhao Feng could predict where Zhao Yijian was going to attack next.Teng! Teng\u2026..Zhao Feng dodged all the attacks easily.\u201cAngry Dragon Fist!\u201d At a certain point, Zhao Feng retaliated.\u201cIce Cold Wind!\u201d Zhao Yijian neither dodged nor defended. Instead his sword went for Zhao Feng\u2019s throat.Zhao Feng felt helpless as, although he could find gaps in Zhao Yijian\u2019s moves, he could not attack since he would be unable to dodge Zhao Yijian\u2019s sword.\u201cCold Flowing Sword focuses on sharpness and offense. It does not have any defense at all! However he has trained it to the high level so his flaws are small and I only have a fifty percent chance to win.\u201d Zhao Feng analysed and predicted inside his mind.The biggest difference between him and Zhao Yijian was the martial art skill level.To beat Zhao Yijian, he only had two options.The first way was to stall, stall until the opponent got tired. Zhao Feng had complete confidence that, with his left eye and inner strength, he could last longer than Zhao Yijian.The second way was to use his inner strength and win by force!Just as Zhao Feng was thinking.\u201cJudge, I think that the two of them are both geniuses and if it drags on and one of them gets injured or dies, we will be punished by the sect.\u201dUsually, even if they stalled, Zhao Yijian had a fifty to sixty percent chance of winning, but he had an unknown feeling that stalling wasn\u2019t a good idea.\u201cBut\u2026. they have not finished yet.\u201d The main judge was a bit hesitant since Zhao Tianjian\u2019s cultivation had reached the sixth rank and his status wasn\u2019t very low.\u201cAlthough they have not finished yet, can you not see who has got the upper hand?\u201d Zhao Tianjian gave a \u2018knowing\u2019 look towards the main judge. It was obvious that if this was done well, there\u2019ll be great rewards\u2026..\u201cFine.\u201d The main judge said, \u201cNumber one hundred and eighty-eight, Zhao Feng, you have the lower hand, so if this drags out the judge has the right to make the decision.\u201dThis is ok?Zhao Feng felt anger surge in his heart. The judge was obviously biased towards Zhao Yijian. Obviously, the judge couldn\u2019t openly say that Zhao Yijian won, but being the judge, they had the right to make a decision after a while. For example, the judge could make a decision if a match dragged out for too long.The judge\u2019s decision did cause some disturbance.\u201cAlthough Zhao Feng\u2019s got the lower hand, he is not losing at all.\u201d\u201cHmph, all he can do is run! He\u2019s just wasting our time!\u201dThe crowd discussed quietly.Although some of the older generation felt that this was unjust, they were not willing to offend Zhao Tianjian and his son just for a mere branch sect disciple.\u201cFine! I will not run!\u201d Zhao Feng laughed bitterly as he stopped.\u201cKid! Take my sword!\u201d Zhao Yijian looked gratefully towards his father.Zhao Tianjian stood with his hands behind his back, faintly smiling. At this point, some people, like Zhao Kun, had gloating faces.Zhao Xue looked at that familiar figure and sighed. She had a complex feeling towards him, some sympathy, some coldness.Sssss!Just as Zhao Yijian\u2019s Cold Flowing Sword approached Zhao Feng, the latter didn\u2019t make any moves to dodge.\u201cAngry Dragon Fists!\u201d Zhao Feng put all his anger into this punchArrogant!The elders shook their heads.\u201cAi.\u201d The main judge sighed as well.\u201cHahaha! It\u2019s no use. Break!\u201d Zhao Yijian laughed as he waved his sparkling sword.\u201cOpen!\u201d Zhao Feng took a deep breath as he gave off an extremely powerful aura.Hu~~~A faint green glow appeared on Zhao Feng\u2019s arms and fists. It looked beautiful under the sunlight.Before the fist arrived, the winds had already hit Zhao Yijian\u2019s body.Peh!With Zhao Feng being at the centre, the dust under the unseen force slowly floated upwards.\u201cWhat! That\u2019s\u2026.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s\u2026.\u201d The main judge stood up; his face was full of excitement.Not good! Zhao Tianjian\u2019s expression turned ugly.\u201cWhat is going on!\u201d Zhao Yijian felt an unknown pressure bear towards him, making him unable to even breathe. Even his sword speed was limited. In his eyes, Zhao Feng\u2019s fist was like a roaring dragon\u2026..Dang! Kraaaak\u2014\u2014Zhao Yijian spat out a mouthful of blood.Clang!His sword split into two pieces and fell onto the ground.There was also an unseen force that travelled through the sword and flowed into his body.\u201cAh!\u201dZhao Yijian groaned as he was knocked twenty metres back.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHu~As Zhao Feng lowered his fist, the dust fell slowly back onto the ground.Not knowing how long had passed, someone shouted, \u201cInner Strength of the Martial Path!\u201dInner Strength!A faint green glow flashed throughout Zhao Feng\u2019s body\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone was completely shocked.The white-bearded judge stood up and murmured, \u201dFourteen years old and he has already understood the principle of Inner Strength. It can be said that he is easily going to become a martial artist. His talent can be compared with Zhao Linlong\u2019s!\u201dThe crowd attention once again focused on Zhao Feng. This was the new king of the outer disciples.Zhao Feng looked incredulously at his fists. He had seen Zhao Yijian\u2019s arm break, seen his sword snap in two\u2026..He had even restrained from using all of his strength. If he did not, Zhao Yijian\u2019s injury wouldn\u2019t just be as simple as a broken arm. At least half his arm would have become useless. If it was a normal third rank cultivator instead, this punch would have killed him instantly.\u201cThis is the power of inner strength.\u201d Zhao Feng trembled with excitement.The disciples in the crowd looked at Zhao Feng in fear. They now understood the difference in strength between Martial Learners and Martial Artists.\u201cZhao Feng wins!\u201d The judge glanced deeply at Zhao Feng. Even though he was biased towards Zhao Yijian, Zhao Feng had still won.It wasn\u2019t just winning, it was winning with complete strength!\u201cJian\u2019er!\u201d Zhao Tianjian screamed and appeared at Zhao Yijian\u2019s side. His speed was so fast that the people nearby only saw a blur.\u201cWhat speed!\u201d Zhao Feng estimated that Zhao Yijian\u2019s father had probably reached the sixth rank of the martial path.The sixth rank of the martial path was the peak of Martial Artists. Another step further would mean becoming a Martial Master.\u201cI lost\u2026. I cannot believe it\u2026..\u201d Zhao Yijian couldn\u2019t feel his left arm.\u201cCall an alchemist!\u201d Zhao Tianjian saw that there was a chance of his son\u2019s arm going useless.\u201cYoungster! What is the meaning of this?\u201d Zhao Tianjian had murderous in his eyes as he looked towards Zhao Feng.The aura of the sixth rank of the martial path caused great pressure bearing towards Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng felt as if the air had been frozen. Every word he spoke would cost him a lot of energy. He was lucky that he had his own inner strength to fight against Zhao Tianjian\u2019s aura.Peh! Peh!The faint green glow inside his left eye, which was originally three feet and nine-tenths of a feet long, started to creep towards the four feet mark\u2026\u2026Under the pressure, Zhao Feng had increased his cultivation.\u201cGood! Now I have the requirements to break through to the fourth rank!\u201d Zhao Feng laughed.After experiencing such a large battle and then being under Zhao Tianjian\u2019s pressure, it helped him increase his cultivation.His slight change did not fool Zhao Tianjian\u2019s eyes.Cannot let him live!Zhao Tianjian felt that Zhao Feng was a threat to him, \u201cYoungster, you\u2019re just a lowly branch disciple. For injuring my son\u2019s arm, I will take away your cultivation.\u201dShuah!In a flash, Zhao Tianjian leapt towards Zhao Feng.Not good!Zhao Feng felt great danger come bearing towards him.It was lucky that he was on guard. The second the power started to condense within Zhao Tianjian\u2019s body, Zhao Feng had seen it with his left eye.Teng!Zhao Feng did not even think at all as he pushed Lightly Floating Ferry to its limit. He jumped over ten metres high and barely managed to dodge the attack. However, he knew that this was the only chance he had to dodge.When Zhao Tianjian missed, he knew that something was wrong, \u201cDie!\u201dHe used his own footwork skill to follow Zhao Feng.\u201cLightly Floating Wave!\u201d Zhao Feng double jumped in midair and ran towards the high status people of the sect.He knew that Zhao Tianjian only had a middle-high status within the sect. The higher level of the sect would not allow for Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation to be crippled in front of them.Sou!Zhao Feng ran towards his target at his fastest speed.\u201cGah! This kid\u2026..\u201d Zhao Tianjian understood Zhao Feng\u2019s intention.\u201cZhao Tianjian! Stop!\u201d A deep voice as loud as thunder boomed. Accompanying this voice, a powerful aura formed overhead. It was a white-bearded old man. He stood in front of Zhao Tianjian.Not good! It is the main judge!Zhao Tianjian knew that he was someone of the seventh rank or higher. However, Zhao Feng was right in front of his eyes! He wasn\u2019t willing to let him go like this! Zhao Tianjian clenched his teeths as he face the elder.\u201cDown!\u201dAn unseen hand slammed downwards.Pah!Zhao Tianjian felt his power disappear as he spat out a mouthful of blood.Attacking through the air! How strong!It was obvious that the main judge had mastered Transformation Strength, the higher level of Inner Strength.\u201cElder! This Zhao Feng is deadly and cunning! He broke my son\u2019s arm! How can you not punish him?\u201d Zhao Tianijan half knelt on the ground as he spoke with fear.\u201cHmph! Who is deadly? When Zhao Feng attacked he had already restrained himself from using all of his strength, or else the result would not be as simple as a broken arm! His arm would at least have been crippled, or could even have died as a result!\u201d The judge said.Zhao Tianjian understood immediately.\u201cWhy not go and help your son.\u201d The white-bearded judge waved his arms and left the stage.Zhao Feng unclenched his fist which was full of cold sweat and looked gratefully at the elder. The elder seemed to notice this and smiled back at him with praise in his eyes.This disturbance didn\u2019t affect the rest of the matches.\u201cHe beat Zhao Yijian\u2026..\u201d Zhao Xue face was stiff. She had a feeling as if she had fallen from heaven and into the abyss.In her eyes, that familiar figure was now the king of the outer disciples.Now, Zhao Feng was without a doubt the best amongst the outer disciples.Seventy wins\u2026\u2026 seventy-one wins\u2026..Zhao Feng\u2019s record kept increasing. Most of his opponents surrendered straight away.Even when he faced Zhao Yue, Zhao Feng only had to use his inner strength to instantly break the opponent\u2019s Metal Body.Zhao Feng\u2019s strength was no longer that of a quasi martial artist, it had reached that of a half-step martial artist! Half-step martial artist was when one had inner strength and had reached quasi martial artist at the same time. To a certain extent, it was the same as being of the fourth rank.However, there was an unexpected turn.Zhao Yufei still had a perfect streak.On Zhao Yufei\u2019s eightieth match, she met Zhao Yue.\u201cButterfly Palm!\u201dZhao Yufei shouted as her jade-like hands bursted out immense strength.Crack!Zhao Yue\u2019s metal body was once again broken.\u201cOh my god! It is Inner Strength again!\u201dNo one had thought that there would be someone else who had understood Inner Strength apart from Zhao Feng.\u201cInteresting!\u201d The main judge had a faint smile.Zhao Feng\u2019s expression however did not change when Zhao Yufei used inner strength.He had already seen the inner strength hiding inside Zhao Yufei\u2019s blood with his left eye.That day, when the coach was giving his lecture, many outer disciples had gained some insights, with Zhao Feng gaining the most.This was because he had the help of his left eye and had already trained the Air Pushing Breathing Technique to the peak of its third level.Therefore, Zhao Feng was the first one to form inner strength.In comparison, Zhao Yufei was later than him by half a month.\u201cIt looks like first place is not decided yet.\u201dThe crowd were anticipating the clash between Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei.Finally, when Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei won their ninetieth match respectively, they met.\u201cBegin.\u201dAlthough Zhao Yufei had inner strength, Zhao Feng did not fear her.\u201cI know there is still some difference between you and me\u2026 but I will not give up.\u201d Zhao Yufei\u2019s smile was like a flower opening.\u201cAngry Dragon Fist!\u201d Zhao Feng started off with his peak level, middle ranked martial art.The reason he could beat Zhao Yijian so badly wasn\u2019t just because of inner strength. It was because Angry Dragon Fist was already at the peak of middle ranked martial arts and when used, its damage exceeded the damage dealt by the high ranked martial arts trained to the low level.Furthermore, Zhao Feng\u2019s Angry Dragon Fists was closing in on the max level.If Angry Dragon Fists can reach its max level, it can easily win against Cold Flowing Sword trained to the high level.Peh! Pah!\u2026\u2026The two exchanged blows.As expected, Zhao Yufei wasn\u2019t as strong as Zhao Feng.After all, Zhao Feng had a stronger foundation of inner strength and his speed was faster. Although Zhao Yufei had a high ranked speed skill, it wasn\u2019t faster than Zhao Feng\u2019s Lightly Floating Ferry.Zhao Feng\u2019s attacks became faster and faster.Zhao Yufei started to turn red as she felt her strength depleting.Good chance!Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye easily locked onto a flaw and his fist hit Zhao Yufei shoulder.\u201cThank you for going easy.\u201d Zhao Yufei\u2019s body shook but she then flipped in midair and landed on the ground.It was obvious that Zhao Feng\u2019s punch had been restrained, or else she would have ended up similar to Zhao Yijian.\u201cNo problem.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled, he really liked Zhao Yufei\u2019s attitude.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter beating Zhao Yufei, there were no more opponents that were his match left. All his opponents admitted defeat.\u201cI give up!\u201d\u201cI surrender!\u201d\u2026\u2026.Half an hour later Zhao Feng finally finished his one hundredth battle, and with his score, easily attained the title of number one amongst the outer disciples.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Feng\u2026\u2026\u201d The crowd cheered. Zhao Feng\u2019s rise caused many youths to worship him.He had finally become the top outer disciple. The crowd gave way where Zhao Feng passed. Even Zhao Kun lowered his head.\u201cWhen did you provoke such a genius?\u201d Zhao Gan looked queerly at his brother.How would I know he would become so strong\u2026\u2026 Zhao Kun had the urge to cry.As Zhao Feng slowly walked, his eyes scanned around.At a certain point, his saw a girl clothed in white.Zhao Xue bit her teeth and didn\u2019t have the courage to look Zhao Feng in the eye. Zhao Feng shook his head, ever since they entered the Zhao sect they have begun to walk different paths.He didn\u2019t feel anything, all he wanted to do was reach the ninth rank of the martial path, maybe even the holy martial rank, and then travel throughout the continent.The ranking contest had reached the late stages, and first place was already confirmed. That was because no one else apart from Zhao Feng had won all their matches.Soon, the ranks were decided.First place: Zhao FengSecond place: Zhao YufeiThird place: Zhao YueFourth place: Zhao Gan\u2026\u2026Only at the ninth rank did Zhao Yijian\u2019s name pop up. This was because Zhao Yijian had been seriously injured when facing Zhao Feng, meaning that he could not participate later on.\u201cFirst place.\u201d Zhao Feng was slightly excited.Two months ago, he had to pray that he could enter the tournament. As for first place, he had never even thought about it. This was all thanks to the mysterious eye.Zhao Feng took a deep breath as he entered the dimension within his eye. The mysterious green glow inside kept spinning in circles. The glow had now extended from three feet nine to almost four feet.Zhao Feng knew that as the green glow extended, the power of his left eye would increase.In a corner in the Sky Martial Field.\u201cThere is a few talented outer disciples this year. Especially Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei, they have the potential to catch up Zhao Linlong.\u201d The one that spoke was a calm, beautiful girl.It was Zhao Qin, the fourth strongest inner disciple.\u201cHehe, it\u2019s just small fights, nothing serious.\u201d The casual voice came from a black-robed youth next to her.The black-robed youth stood shoulder to shoulder next to Zhao Qin and lazily glanced towards the Sky Martial Field\u2019s outer disciples.I feel that Zhao Feng is not simple. When he first hid his Inner Strength, even I could not see it. Also, his speed skill can even be ranked top three within the inner disciples. Zhao Qin thought.\u201cDo you think they can threaten us? I only have one opponent and that is Zhao Linlong!\u201d The black-robed youth said.\u201cZhao Chi, do not be over arrogant. I have heard that Zhao Han, who is ranked third, had been in seclusion for the last couple of months.\u201d Zhao Qin smiled.\u201cZhao Han? I think that he has a cousin called Zhao Yijian, no?\u201d The black-robed youth looked playfully towards Zhao Feng.Zhao Feng felt something and glanced over in a certain direction. In that corner stood one quiet girl and one lazy black-robed youth. The quiet girl Zhao Feng knew. It was Zhao Qin. As for the black-robed youth\u2026..\u201cOh my god! It is Zhao Chi!\u201d\u201cZhao Chi! Second place of the inner disciples, right behind Zhao Linlong!\u201dThe crowd screamed.Even some of the inner disciples showed fear as they looked towards Zhao Chi.Zhao Feng and Zhao Chi\u2019s eyes crossed.The moment Zhao Feng met Zhao Chi\u2019s eyes, he felt an unbearable pressure. Especially when his left eye locked onto Zhao Chi, he got the feeling that he was unbeatable.Zhao Chi was neither fat nor slim, but the Inner Strength in him was spread evenly to each and every muscle.Peak of the fourth rank! His strength is probably even stronger than Zhao Qin! Zhao Feng accurately recorded his strength.\u201cI heard that when Zhao Chi was a half-step martial artist he beat a true martial artist. I did not think that he would show up to the outer disciple tournament.\u201dFrom Zhao Qin\u2019s reaction, it was obvious that she thought Zhao Feng was very important. As for Zhao Chi, he placed more importance on Zhao Yufei.Zhao Feng knew that, although he was the top outer disciple, there was still had a huge gap between him and the inner disciples.Apparently, every inner disciple had watched the outer disciples tournament at one point.All except for one person! Zhao Linlong!One of the four great geniuses of Sun Feather City.\u201cWith my strength I would not place well in the inner disciples\u2026.\u201d Zhao Feng had a solemn face. All the inner disciples were treated as important by the sect. Right now, Zhao Feng could easily charge into the top ten for the inner disciples. There was still a chance for top five. Top three however\u2026. That was almost impossible.The main tournament is half a month later. Should I aim for first place? Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t decide.However, he soon made his decision:Fight! He must fight!He remembered the rewards from the sect! Only the top three disciples had the chance to learn Peak ranked martial art skills.Peak ranked martial art skills!They were the highest ranked martial art skills in mundane knowledge! A set of peak ranked martial art skills could allow for one to cultivate to the ninth rank of the martial path. Only Holy ranked martial arts could allow for one to achieve the Holy Martial Path\u201dTo survive in this world, one must have absolute strength. This means that the higher rank the skill is, the better.First, or top three. Zhao Feng confirmed his goals as he walked slowly towards his home.As he got home he realised that there many people visiting. His father Zhao Tianyang was very busy. The lonely house was now full of people.\u201cBrother Tianyang, congratulations on having such a good son.\u201d\u201cTop outer disciple! He has also learned Inner Strength, it is obvious that he will receive attention from the higher level of the sect.\u201dThe guests exclaimed as they saw Zhao Feng return. Zhao Feng scrunched up his eyebrows, he wasn\u2019t used to this.These \u2018guests\u2019 usually looked disdainfully towards his family and their relationships weren\u2019t very good.Today however, all of them came over.Zhao Feng and his parents finally shooed them away.\u201cInner Strength? Half-step martial artist? Feng\u2019er, you have given your father such a big surprise!\u201d Zhao Tianyang said red-faced.Not everyone could enter the Sky Martial Field. For example, Zhao Tianyang could only watch on from far away. When they heard that their son won, they first thought that their ears had gone wrong.\u201cWhen did my son become so strong?\u201d Zhao Tianyang felt a bit suspicious. He knew that his son wasn\u2019t that outstanding.\u201cHehe, ever since I got struck by lightning, I have felt that it became easier to learn martial arts\u2026.\u201d Zhao Feng half truthfully, half lying, explained. His explanation was so-so.The world was very large. Not every legend was born talented. One\u2019s path would also be affected by the thing\u2019s they met later on in life.Furthermore, Zhao Feng\u2019s turning point in life was when he got struck in lightning.After listening to this explanation, his parents were no longer suspicious.The night on the same day.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t sleep. Instead he closed his eyes and thought about the process of the tournament. The memories appeared in his mind. Every scene was imprinted in his brain. These included the scenes when he was fighting Zhao Yue, Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yufei.Apart from this, he had also remembered how the main judge and Zhao Tianjian had moved. Obviously, there ranks far exceeded Zhao Feng so he couldn\u2019t understand. However, even so, Zhao Feng gained some insight.Suddenly, Zhao Feng turned into a blur as he headed into an open field.He! He! \u2026\u2026\u2026Zhao Feng closed his eyes and displayed the Flaming Metal Fist and Angry Dragon Fist. Every move of his changed slightly as he thought about the fight with Zhao Yue, Zhao Yijian and Zhao Yufei.Hu~Zhao Feng\u2019s moves became faster and faster, and then he poured Inner Strength into them. The three feet nine green glowing light creeped forward another step.At the last moment he remembered the pressure he felt when facing Zhao Tianjian.Ta!Zhao Feng shouted as the Inner Strength inside his body began to slowly move. Every palm he hit had thumping sound accompanying it.Half an hour later, just as Zhao Feng was exhausted.Hua~~~~~Zhao Feng felt that his limbs and body were on fire. A warm feeling shivered throughout his entire body. At the same time, a thick layer of sweat and dirt was discharged from his body.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI did it!\u201dZhao Feng eyes shone with excitement.The green glow within his eye had now reached the four feet mark.And at this moment, Zhao Feng reached the fourth rank of the Martial Path.He could feel the powerful strength coursing through his body with every breath. With just a thought, Inner Strength would flood out.\u201cMy power has increased by around 500 kilograms, and the power of my Inner Strength has at least doubled.\u201d Zhao Feng saw all the changes throughout his body with his left eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Once one reached the fourth rank one had become a true martial artist. It was like a fish turning into a phoenix.A true martial artist would receive great treatment anywhere in Cloud County.On this continent, how many Martial Learners were unable to enter this rank?Becoming a martial artist had been his dream. Now, this goal had come true so quickly. Although he knew he was going to reach the fourth rank soon, it still happened faster than expected.A few days before the tournament Zhao Feng had tried to reach the fourth rank. At that time, he felt that his foundation was not solid enough, it would have affected the later realms if he rushed, so he did not force himself to break through.However, every match he fought against those top outer disciples, it helped solidify his foundation. However, just this point alone was not enough for him to reach the fourth rank.\u201cI have to go thank Zhao Yijian\u2019s father.\u201d Zhao Feng said mockingly.Zhao Tianjian had murderous intent towards him. Feeling the pressure of the sixth rank, it helped utilise Zhao Feng\u2019s potential, allowing for him to break through to the fourth rank.Even his \u2018peak level\u2019 Angry Dragon Fists had moved towards the max level. If Zhao Tianjian knew of this, he would probably cough up blood.\u201cThat Zhao Tianjian wants to kill me.\u201d Zhao Feng warned himself.Due to this, Zhao Feng wanted to hide the fact that he had broken through to the fourth rank. He fully pushed the Hiding Air Technique to help him appear like he still had the cultivation of a peak third ranker. Zhao Feng seemed like he was a half-step martial artist, not a true martial artist.After reaching the fourth rank, the first Zhao Feng did was to consolidate his foundation. For the past few months his cultivation speed had been extremely fast. After he solidified his foundation, he started to merge the insights he had gained. This time, he used his left eye and replayed his Angry Dragon Fists back and forth.If my Angry Dragon Fists can reach the max level, then if I even met the high level of a high ranked martial skill, I can still beat it. Zhao Feng thought.However, although Zhao Feng had gained some insights, it still was not enough for him to push Angry Dragon Fists to the max level. He had confidence though, that Angry Dragon Fists only needed a few more days to reach its max level.Before dawn Zhao Feng turned into a blur and returned home. On the way, he used his left eye and everything was as bright as day. His eye could see everything within seven miles. If it was during daytime, it would at least double.The left eye gave him an increase in reaction speed, vision, and mind energy.Zhao Feng could not understand this \u201cMind Energy\u201d either. Simply said, mind energy allowed for one\u2019s brain to not get tired, even after using it for a whole day.\u2026\u2026\u2026.The morning of the second day, Zhao Feng still meditated on his bed and didn\u2019t sleep.Because his left eye\u2019s ability had increased, Zhao Feng felt that he was full of power even though he had not slept. This meant that Zhao Feng had more time to cultivate.\u201cIs this Zhao Feng\u2019s house?\u201d A crispy sound sounded out the room.\u201cWho is it?\u201d Zhao Shi went to open the door.Outside stood a glamorously clothed middle-aged man with a few servants behind him. Even though they were servants, they still had strength of the second rank.Zhao Feng felt that the man seemed familiar.\u201cHead manager!\u201d Zhao Tianyang was shocked as he went to receive him. Zhao Feng realised that this person was the outer disciples head manager.The head manager held much power is his hands and was rarely seen. In terms of cultivation, he had already reached the sixth rank of the martial path and was stronger than Zhao Tianjian.Zhao Tianyan quickly invited the head manager inside.\u201cZhao Tianyang! It is your luck for having such a good son!\u201d The head manager smiled.\u201cThis youngster sees head manager.\u201d Zhao Feng walked out of his room and slightly bowed. At the same time he fully pushed the Hiding Air Technique to its fullest so that the head manager would not see that he had broken through to the fourth rank.\u201cNot bad, not bad! I have seen your information. Not even fourteen years old and you have already formed Inner Strength, becoming a half-step martial artist. Zhao Linlong was only the same as you back then.\u201d The head manager praised.After talking a bit, Zhao Feng asked: \u201cWhy has the manager come over?\u201d\u201cAh! I almost forgot what I was supposed to do.\u201d The manager coughed slightly then resumed a serious expression, \u201cBecause of your performance the sect has decided to fully help you cultivate. From now on, you can move to the inner disciples and have a monthly allowance of five hundred silver. Also, every martial art on the first floor of the Martial Arts Library will be open to you\u2026\u2026\u2026\u201dZhao Tianyang and Zhao Shi were very excited as they gave their thanks. Even Zhao Feng was slightly shocked. He didn\u2019t think that the sect would come to him this quickly.A monthly allowance of five hundred silver was more than twenty times higher than his original amount. When he was at the first rank, he had a monthly allowance of ten silver. He received twenty silver at the second rank.Now, not only did his allowance increase by a lot, he also got other benefits. This was promotion!Maybe it was because Zhao Feng\u2019s performance was too exceptional that he got to moved to the inner disciples place even before the main tournament.\u201cMany thanks to the sect and manager.\u201d Zhao Feng humbly said.Being born in a massive sect like this, although some things were unfair, he still got the best treatment within the sect. This was due to competition and limited resources.\u201cOk, I will send some people to help settle you in.\u201d The head manager ordered the servants behind him.Zhao Feng moved into his new house on the same day.Everyone who lived in this area would have the protection of the sect, no matter if they were disciples or relatives. Arriving here meant that not just Zhao Feng was protected, his parents were too.\u201cThis garden is massive, it can easily fit me training in here. This place even has a reading room, bathroom, storage room, and even a horse paddock\u2026\u2026\u201d Zhao Feng felt excited as he moved in.Since he received the highest treatment from the sect, it meant that they received some servants too.After moving in, Zhao Feng once again started to consolidate his foundation. Usually, he would train inside the house, but he would go to a hidden place when he trained in a secret move.After two days, his foundation had solidified.\u201cThere are ten more days until the main tournament. I need to at least train Angry Dragon Fists to the max level so that I have a chance to fight for the top three positions.\u201dThat night, his Angry Dragon Fists reached the max level. Now, every fist from the max level Angry Dragon Fists caused rumbles.Crack!Zhao Feng easily snapped a tree in front of him. This casual punch had the same power as the Green Headed Tiger King. Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t hide his excitement. No one amongst neither the inner nor outer disciples could say that they had trained a middle ranked martial art to its max level.This was because if someone was this talented, they could easily train a high rank martial art skill to the high or peak level.The second morning.Zhao Feng sat cross-legged as he trained his Inner Strength. He now had more time to cultivate, therefore his Air Crossing Breathing Technique increased steadily.\u201cZhao Feng! Zhao Feng!\u201d Outside came a shout.Hm? Zhao Feng saw that a few familiar outer disciples ran outside his door. One of them was Zhao Kun.\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Zhao Feng felt a bit surprised.\u201dA few Xin family disciples came to challenge us. My brother and Zhao Guang all lost horribly.\u201d Zhao Kun said.Xin family disciples? Challenge? What has this got to do with me? Zhao Feng thought.\u201cA few of them wants to challenge you, the top outer disciple.\u201d Zhao Kun said.\u201cWhere are they?\u201d Since others wanted to challenge him, Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t going to avoid it. Especially since he had just broken through, he wanted to move around a bit.Soon.Zhao Feng followed the other outer disciples and arrived at the Zhao sect\u2019s front gate. Noises came from in front.\u201cHehe, the new Zhao sect disciples are so weak.\u201d\u201cBrother Fei has been increasing rapidly, not even three quasi martial artists can block one of your moves.\u201d\u201cI heard that your Zhao sect has a new genius called Zhao Feng, let him come out and fight.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u2026\u2026\u2026Around twenty Xin disciples stood at the front gate. There were two people in front. One\u2019s face was scarred while the other wore a grass-hat. The cultivation of these two people had both reached the fourth rank. Especially the youth with the grass hat, his cultivation had reached the peak of the fourth rank.\u201cYi! It is him!\u201d Zhao Feng recognised the scar faced youth, it was Xin Fei. It seems that he had broken through to the fourth rank after fighting against the tiger.Right now, the Xin disciples had the upper hand. All the Xin disciples present cheered, whereas five or sixth youth\u2019s of the Zhao family were lying on the ground. Zhao Yue and Zhao Gan had injuries.\u201cZhao Feng, you\u2019re here!\u201d Zhao Yue said, then groaned due to the pain from his injuries. After all, Zhao Feng was now the top outer disciple.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

I think Zhao Linlong should come out instead.\u201d The grass-hat youth said disdainfully. His cultivation was the highest amongst them so he had not fought yet.Xin Fei\u2019s eyes lit up when he saw Zhao Feng.\u201cZhao Feng! That Xin Fei is the top outer disciple. He beat three of us in one move.\u201d Zhao Gan warned.Three people? In one move? Zhao Feng was slightly surprised since Zhao Gan and the rest were all quasi martial artists.\u201cZhao Feng, we meet again. Do you still remember our battle?\u201d Xin Fei said as he slowly walked forward. He didn\u2019t look down on Zhao Feng due to his cultivation.Last time in Sky Cloud Forest, Xin Fei had not forgotten that Zhao Feng had only been at the peak of the second rank then, and that he had beaten Xin Gang, who was at the peak of the third rank, in three moves.Half a month ago, Xin Fei reached the fourth rank, becoming the top outer disciple of the Xin family. He then heard that the Zhao family had a new genius, only thirteen years of age and had already formed Inner Strength, becoming the top outer disciple.And that genius was called Zhao Feng. To challenge the Zhao sect today wasn\u2019t a coincidence. Xin Fei\u2019s target was Zhao Feng. And the grass-hat youth\u2019s target was Zhao Linlong.\u201cOf course I remember.\u201d Zhao Feng walked forward. The crowd gave space. Zhao Feng and Xin Fei stood a few metres apart as they looked at each other.The grass-hat youth of the Xin family was slightly surprised, \u201cAlthough Xin Fei has just reached the fourth rank, his strength is not to be underestimated. Yet, he\u2019s taking this fight very seriously.\u201d\u201cMy cultivation and age are both higher than you. I will not use my sword against you.\u201d Xin Fei said as he sheathed his sword.\u201cXin Fei, I will advise you to use all of your strength.\u201d Zhao Feng said confidently. His words made the two different family disciples stunned.\u201cHmph!\u201d\u201cWhere does his confidence come from?\u201dThe Xin family disciples sniggered, whereas the Zhao family disciples stood shocked.\u201cAs you wish.\u201d Xin Fei\u2019s expression turned solemn as he slowly took out his long sword again.\u201cIt is starting.\u201d Zhao Feng shouted as he pushed his Inner Strength throughout his body. His speed was so fast that many spectators couldn\u2019t see his actions. Also, Zhao Feng\u2019s body felt like it had no weight as it floated around.Third Wind Slice!Xin Fei\u2019s long sword instantly flew out.Shua! Shua! Shua\u2026.In half a breath\u2019s time Xin Fei had sliced three sword, the leaves scattered around him were easily grinded into dust.Angry Dragon Fist!Zhao Feng easily dodged and, under the help of Air Crossing Breathing Technique, did not lose his agility. He easily dodged the first two swords.Bang!Only on the third sword did Zhao Feng\u2019s fist, which was glowing green, clash against Xin Fei\u2019s sword.\u201cWhat explosive strength! And that Inner Strength seems so mysterious.\u201dXin Fei felt his arm go numb as the long sword in his hand almost fell from his grip. He also felt a very fast and powerful Inner Strength enter his body.Teng~~~~Xin Fei was pushed back a few steps as he barely managed to cancel out the opponent\u2019s attack. He immediately realised why he had the lower hand in this exchange.Firstly, Zhao Feng\u2019s Angry Dragon Fists had an insane explosive power, it had already reached the max level. Secondly, the punch went straight for the weakness in his attack. Thirdly, Zhao Feng\u2019s Inner Strength was not weaker than his, it was even more complex than his to a certain degree. The most important reason was the third one.Being a true martial artist, how could he lost to a half-step martial artist?Seventh stance of the Angry Dragon!Zhao Feng kept on utilising his fist skill and kept attacking since he had the upper hand.Since Angry Dragon Fists had reached its max level, Zhao Feng\u2019s moves had left the restrictions of the original skill. Especially when used together with Air Crossing Breathing Technique, it helped increase its agility.Sixth Wind Slice!Xin Fei didn\u2019t hesitate at all as he used his strongest move. At that moment the cold light twirled around the area. One sword after another locked the opponent within a few metres.The spectating martial artists had their expression change.Zhao Feng knew that the opponent\u2019s move was an area attack that tried to push him back. However, Zhao Feng did not retreat. Instead he dodged and occasionally blocked the attacks by hitting their flaws.In terms of speed, he easily beat Xin Fei, his Inner Strength was much higher as well.Dang!Zhao Feng\u2019s fist hit the back of Xin Fei\u2019s sword. Zhao Feng also sent out many punches containing Inner Strength.Xin Fei could only fall back.Wah!After seven punches, he finally spat out a mouthful of blood and exited the fighting circle.\u201cThanks.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled faintly, leaving the rest of the disciples in shock.\u201cSo strong! A half-step martial artist beat a true martial artist!\u201d\u201cNo wonder he is our Zhao sect\u2019s strongest outer disciple!\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026..To beat a true martial artist while using the power of a half-step martial artist was indeed hard.Zhao Feng had been \u2018restricted\u2019 in his fight. His power, Inner Strength and Angry Dragon Fists weren\u2019t used to their fullest. Even so, he still beat Xin Fei in ten moves.\u201cI admire your skills.\u201d Even though Xin Fei lost, he didn\u2019t feel embarrassed. Instead he felt calm. Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but praise the opponent, he was neither too arrogant nor too humble. His mind set could tell one that his latter days wouldn\u2019t be low.\u201cHehe! Not bad kid, I, Xin Tong want to fight too.\u201d The grass-hat youth said.Shua!His two arms waved ripping off his t-shirt and hat, revealing his muscular body inside.Si!The Zhao sect disciples took in a cold breath. Zhao Feng inspected with his left eye and couldn\u2019t help but be shocked. Every inch of Xin Tong\u2019s body seemed to be covered in bronze. The powerful strength coursed through his body.\u201cZhao Feng, be careful! He is Xin Tong, the third strongest inner disciple of the Xin family and has trained Bronze Skin Metal Body to the fourth level. Even swords cannot harm him\u2026\u2026.\u201d Zhao Gan warned.Before he could even finish Xin Tong slowly walked over. Although he didn\u2019t purposely try to imitate Zhao Feng, he caused great pressure just by walking.Just by body strength alone he can face fourth rankers. Zhao Feng felt an unseen pressure.\u201cYou will be my dish before I challenge Zhao Linlong.\u201d Xin Tong licked his lips. As he was talking, he was casually walking towards Zhao Feng.The pressure that came with him was even more obvious. Zhao Feng felt that there were many many flaws on Xin Tong\u2019s body.Flaming Metal Fist!Zhao Feng used the Air Breathing Crossing Technique to easily form Inner Strength and easily hit the opponent\u2019s chest.Peng!As the fist hit Xin Tong, the latter laughed, \u201cThis is all of your strength?\u201dWhat a strong body?The disciples watching stared.\u201cNot good!\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s punch didn\u2019t even break the opponent\u2019s defense.\u201cGet out!\u201d Xin Tong\u2019s shout was as loud as thunder. He casually waved his arm and the thick metal-like Inner Strength came crushing over. This move could probably even threaten those of the fifth rank.It was lucky that Zhao Feng reacted fast and quickly formed his own Inner Strength.Peh! Ceng\u2014\u2013Every time they clashed Zhao Feng would feel his arm go numb. He knew that the biggest difference between them was body strength and defense.Xin Tong focused on his body. His muscles were as strong as metal, meaning his power exceeded that of normal people of the fourth rank.Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation was restrained at half-step martial artist. His power and Inner Strength could only be used up to sixty-seventy percent, so obviously he could not win.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u2026\u2026 Kid, you\u2019re too weak! Hurry up and call Zhao Linglong. Apart from him, no one is my opponent.\u201d After pushing back Zhao Feng in one move, he suddenly stopped.Ceng!Zhao Feng was like a feather that landed gracefully on the ground. Since he had the advantage in speed and Inner Strength, Zhao Feng wouldn\u2019t have lost.Xin Tong was helpless and did not want to waste energy. Instead, he wanted to preserve his strength to fight Zhao Linlong.\u201cReally? Apart from Zhao Linlong, no one is your match?\u201d A cold voice sounded from behind.\u201cWho\u2019s there?!\u201d Xin Tong shouted.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned to the owner of the voice.\u201cZhao Han!\u201dIn everyone view, a cold youth slowly walked out.His every step would cause a chill.\u201cZhao Han. Third amongst the inner disciples, just a bit weaker than Zhao Linlong and Zhao Chi.\u201dZhao Feng also inspected Zhao Han. However, as his left eye locked onto Zhao Han, he got a major shock.Fifth rank of the Martial Path! Not fourth, but fifth rank of the martial path!\u201cHow is it possible? When did Zhao Han reach the fifth rank?\u201d The disciples from both families exclaimed.\u201cIt looks like the first place amongst the inner disciples might change.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI heard that even Zhao Linlong has not reached the fifth rank.\u201d\u2026\u2026.Zhao Han\u2019s appearance stunned everyone.His cold eyes scanned through the crowd and finally landed on Zhao Feng\u2019s face, \u201cYou are Zhao Feng?\u201dHm? Zhao Feng felt a cold pressure towards him and thought, Does this Zhao Han know me?Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He did not know why he felt enmity from Zhao Han.\u201cGood, good, good!\u201d Zhao Han\u2019s face turned even colder as he said good three times, then proceeded to not look at Zhao Feng anymore.Zhao Feng felt baffled since this was the first time he ever saw Zhao Han, so when did he offend him?Zhao Yue walked up to Zhao Feng and warned, \u201cZhao Han is Zhao Yijian\u2019s cousin and their relationship is quite good.\u201dZhao Yijian\u2019s cousin?No wonder Zhao Han had enmity towards him. Zhao Yijian was still lying in bed right now due to his injury.Being his cousin, Zhao Han was obviously going to take revenge.However, right now they were facing enemies from outside. They would have to first settle this and then discuss internal matters.\u201cFifth rank of the Martial Path?\u201d Xin Tong\u2019s expression changed, but soon recovered, \u201cSo what if you\u2019re the fifth rank?\u201d Being a top fourth ranker, he had experience fighting fifth ranks.\u201cLittle bug!\u201d Zhao Han walked step by step towards Xin Tong. For every step he took, the cold from him would increase. The cold wasn\u2019t just a feeling, it was real cold that came from his Inner Strength.\u201cYou\u2019ve just reached the fifth rank not long ago. I\u2019ll see how strong you are right now.\u201d Xing Tong snorted, but his expression was solemn.\u201cMetal Arm!\u201d Xin Tong put his immense power and Inner Strength into his arm and his whole body seemed like a bull.His skill was a high ranked one, which allowed one to compress one\u2019s strength in one attack, allowing for the user to overpower his opponent.Zhao Feng saw that there were no flaws, it was obvious that Xin Tong had gone easy on him.\u201cSnowing Cold Palm!\u201d Zhao Han\u2019s body poured out a freezing aura, just like snow. As he used his palm attack, the area around started to freeze.The cold aura made Zhao Feng\u2019s heart jump because this Inner Strength was way too strong, it was almost as strong as Zhao Tianijian\u2019s.As soon as Xin Tong rushed forward, he felt an unknown force block him, as if he fell into mud.\u201cHow is this the Inner Strength of a beginner fifth rank?\u201d Xin Tong thought.Pah\u2014-The two palms clashed together. Using his strength, Xin Tong forcefully pushed back Zhao Han one step. However, the corner of his mouth started to leak blood. The ice cold Inner Strength had flowed through his defense and entered his body.\u201cHow is this possible, this Inner Strength has reached the peak of the fifth rank!\u201d Xin Tong felt his blood freeze. He couldn\u2019t move.He!Zhao Han sent him flying with one kick and then coldly laughed, \u201cJust this amount of strength and you want to challenge Zhao Linlong? Only I have the right to beat him.\u201d\u201cBrother Tong!\u201d The Xin disciples went to help him.\u201cI\u2019m all right.\u201d Xin Tong barely managed to get out. It was lucky for him that his body was strong. If it was someone else they would have been bedridden for at least one month.\u201cZhao Han, I admit that you\u2019re strong.\u201d Xin Tong bit his teeth as he continued, \u201cBut you\u2019ve just recently reached the fifth rank and your Inner Strength is this strong, which means that you have eaten some sort of treasure. But what is the use of outside help? When you met my family\u2019s top genius Xin Wuheng, you will lose!\u201dWhen they heard up to here Zhao Feng and the others had expressions of thought. Zhao Han\u2019s circumstance was too abnormal, he had only just reached the fifth rank and had such powerful Inner Strength.When Zhao Feng used his left eye to inspect Zhao Han, he was certainly shocked because that Inner Strength was way too strong.Xin Tong analysed correctly, Zhao Han must have used some treasures.\u201cWhat if I used outer help? That is my luck, it is the heavens helping me. When I finish refining this energy and beat Zhao Linlong, I will definitely go challenge Xin Wuheng.\u201d Zhao Han coldly said.Xin Wuheng, the top inner disciple of the Xin family, also one of the four great geniuses of Sun Feather City. Zhao Feng had also heard this name before.Apparently, Xin Wuheng was the top genius out of the four and had reached the fifth rank one year ago. He was even stronger than Zhao Linlong!Since Xin Tong lost, the Xin family disciples quickly left with their tails between their legs.\u201cZhao Han only used half a year to reach the fifth rank!\u201d\u201cI am so excited for the main tournament in ten days time!\u201dZhao Han was the main focus of the people. Obviously, Zhao Feng\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t bad, using the strength of a half-step martial artist to beat a true martial artist.Before leaving, Zhao Han stared at Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t avoid him and faced Zhao Han in the eye. He didn\u2019t believe that Zhao Han would attack him right now, in front of all the other Zhao sect disciples. Even if he couldn\u2019t win, Zhao Feng could still use Lightly Floating Ferry to escape.\u201cI will do what you did. We will meet when I challenge you at the tournament.\u201dI Will do what you did? Zhao Feng felt cold. He had broken Zhao Yijian\u2019s arm on the outer disciples tournament. Zhao Han\u2019s meaning in \u2018doing what you did\u2019 was already very obvious\u2026.On the way back, Zhao Feng asked Zhao Yue next to him, \u201cWhat is the challenging thing he talked about?\u201d\u201cEvery inner disciple tournament is done by challenging. Every participant can challenge a certain person. Zhao Yue explained.Even this can happen?Zhao Feng heart clenched as he understood Zhao Han\u2019s meaning. Zhao Han had already laid out all of his plans clear and sound, he was absolutely confident in himself. Although it was an \u201copen plan\u201d, it would be hard to avoid it.Want to break my arm? Zhao Feng\u2019s expression turned colder and colder. There was only ten days left till the main tournament.Zhao Feng cultivated even harder.Every night he would work on his Inner Strength by training in the Air Crossing Breathing Technique. Zhao Feng knew the distance between him and Zhao Han was in Inner Strength.In terms of complexity, Air Crossing Breathing Technique was top tier high ranked martial art, almost reaching the peak ranked martial art category. It could be said that it was the best martial art out of all the Zhao sect disciples.The second day.Zhao Feng felt that his Angry Dragon Fists was even getting more perfected as he trained in the garden. Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye had recorded many interesting battles between disciples and used them all to perfect his Angry Dragon Fists.Therefore, after Zhao Feng\u2019s Angry Dragon Fists reached \u2018max level\u2019, the power was slowly increasing\u2026.His strength right now was more than double the of that he had at the outer disciples tournament.\u201cCan I come in?\u201d A crystal clear sound sounded from outside. Zhao Feng felt that the sound was familiar and saw a purple-clothed girl standing outside waiting.It\u2019s her? Zhao Feng was a bit surprised.\u201cAm I not welcome?\u201d Zhao Yufei beautiful eyebrows blinked slightly, her smile was like a lotus, pure and innocent.\u201cPlease come in.\u201d Zhao Feng soon recovered from her beauty.After Zhao Yufei came in, she soon told him the point of her visit, it was to spar with Zhao Feng. Obviously, Zhao Yufei was a bit unwilling after losing to Zhao Feng last time.\u201cOk, but let\u2019s notharm each other.\u201d Zhao Feng obviously didn\u2019t reject her as she was the only outer disciple that could spar with him.Soon the two figures fought throughout the garden. While sparring, Zhao Feng only pushed Angry Dragon Fists to the \u2018peak level\u2019. Even then he gained the upper hand.After half the time it took an incense to burn, Zhao Yufei lost, her breathing was ragged as her eyebrows flashed, \u201cYour Inner Strength forms and attacks very quickly. It also gives me a mysterious and floating feeling, what kind of secret technique is it?\u201dIn the battle, Zhao Feng had controlled his Inner Strength to the same level as Zhao Yufei.Even so, Zhao Feng\u2019s Inner Strength still created more pressure than hers.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThis was because of the Air Crossing Breathing Technique.I cultivate the Three Breaths Technique, a high ranked martial art that focuses on Inner Strength, yet it is not as strong as his. Zhao Yufei was shocked in her heart.\u201cHehe, it is my special skill, it\u2019s not going to be told.\u201d Zhao Feng gently smiled. Zhao Feng\u2019s rejection made Zhao Yufei surprised as not many youths of the same age would reject her propositions.Her eyes twirled as she smilingly said, \u201cYou obviously still have some flaws, if you have some interest, we can do a deal that allows for both of us to gain benefits.\u201d\u201cOh? Let\u2019s talk about it\u2026..\u201d Zhao Feng was instantly interested.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 30": "Chapter 30Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 30 \u2013 Metal Wall Technique\u201cYou have a great advantage in speed and Inner Strength, but defense is your weakness.\u201d Zhao Yufei looked at Zhao Feng.\u201cYes! That is my flaw.\u201d Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t surprised. After he had merged with the left eye his vision could see the smallest detail. Since Zhao Feng could easily see his opponent\u2019s flaws, he could also see his own.\u201cHave you learned any body strengthening technique?\u201d Zhao Yufei was slightly surprised.\u201cNo.\u201dIt wasn\u2019t that he didn\u2019t want to, it was just that body strengthening techniques needed a long time to train and couldn\u2019t be easily learned within a short period of time.Normal skills and techniques only needed understanding and talent to easily train in them within a short amount of time. Only body strengthening techniques needed resources as well as effort to learn.\u201cThe body is the foundation of cultivation. A high ranked body strengthening technique can not only help solidify one\u2019s foundation, it can also improve one\u2019s defense. Does big brother Zhao Feng want to learn one\u2026..?\u201d Zhao Yufei gently smiled.The \u201cbig brother Zhao Feng\u201d part made Zhao Feng\u2019s heart beat. Instantly Zhao Yufei\u2019s face turned red, as if it was dripping blood. Within the sect, the older disciples were called \u2018big brother\u2019. Maybe it was that Zhao Feng\u2019s performance had been too shocking, letting Zhao Yufei miss this point.\u201cIt has some reasons. Maybe I can consider it.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head after some deep thought. Before, Zhao Feng\u2019s forte was his speed. People of the same rank wouldn\u2019t even be able to reach him, therefore he had neglected the uses of body strengthening techniques.Now, with Zhao Yufei\u2019s hint, Zhao Feng started to pay attention to it. If he didn\u2019t have Inner Strength, this hidden card, he probably wouldn\u2019t have been able to block Zhao Yijian\u2019s Cold Flowing Sword.Zhao Yue on the other hand, without the use of Inner Strength, could counter Zhao Yijian for a while, this was all due to the fact that he had learned a body strengthening technique.Sparring with Xin Tong yesterday made Zhao Feng realise the importance of body strengthening techniques.The same afternoon that day.Zhao Yufei invited Zhao Feng over to her place. Zhao Feng surprisingly found that Zhao Yufei\u2019s house was next to his. Zhao Yufei had received the same treatment with Zhao Feng, both were highly looked upon by the sect.\u201cGrandfather!\u201d Zhao Yufei yelled happily as she got back.\u201cYufei is back.\u201d From the room came out an one-armed old man, he didn\u2019t speak more after casually glancing at Zhao Feng.\u201cI wonder what deal Zhao Yufei is talking about?\u201d Zhao Feng finally went to the point.\u201cPlease wait brother Zhao Feng.\u201d Zhao Yufei walked towards the old man and spoke a few words.Finally the one-armed old man nodded and went back to the room to retrieve an old book.\u201cThis skill is called Metal Wall Technique and it is quite famous within the Cloud Country. It is even better than Zhao Yue\u2019s Metal Body. The one-armed old man gently sighed as he gave the book to Zhao Yufei.Zhao Feng immediately realised that this grandfather and granddaughter pair had already made plans and had already seen the Inner Strength advantage given by Air Crossing Breathing Technique.The reason Zhao Yufei wanted to spar with Zhao Feng was to point out his body strength was lacking, therefore proposing a deal.\u201cMetal Wall Technique?\u201d Zhao Feng gently murmured. He had not heard anyone speak about this technique before. Zhao Yue\u2019s Metal Body was a high ranked martial skill, Xin Tong\u2019s Bronze Body was the same.According to the old man, this body strengthening technique was much better than Metal Body.\u201cThis body strengthening skill is a simplified version of the Holy martial skill \u201cSilver Wall Technique\u201d. Even though it has been simplified and only contains the first third of it, it can still be considered a peak high ranked martial art.\u201d The old man said proudly.Holy Martial Art? Zhao Feng took a cold breath and started to inspect the one-armed old man. To be able to take out such a high ranked skill, he could not have a simple background.He used his left eye but found that the blood within the old man was similar to that of a commoner, it had no aura coming from the Inner Strength.\u201cTen years ago, I lost my cultivation in an accident.\u201d The old man seemed to feel Zhao Feng\u2019s inspection and explained.\u201cSorry.\u201d Zhao Feng felt guilty as he took back his eyes.The one armed old man was expressionless and continued, \u201cFor my granddaughter today, I will give you this Metal Wall Technique in exchange for your Inner Strength skill. How do you feel about this deal?\u201d This was within Zhao Feng\u2019s guesses.\u201cLet me think.\u201d Zhao Feng started to analyse the benefits and problems.Air Crossing Breathing Technique was only a Inner Strength skill and easily surpasses high ranked martial arts, it probably wasn\u2019t any weaker than peak ranked martial arts. However, this Inner Strength\u2019s power needed Lightly Floating Ferry to be utilised to its maximum potential.Obviously, Metal Wall Technique wasn\u2019t bad either, it was a simplified version of a Holy Martial Art and had already reached the peak of the high rank, not far away from being a peak ranked martial art.Thinking up to here, Zhao Feng soon had his answer.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded and asked Zhao Yufei to give him some paper. Afterwards, he wrote down the contents of Air Crossing Breathing Technique.Zhao Feng only wrote the contents of Air Crossing Breathing Technique, but didn\u2019t write anything that linked it to Lightly Floating Ferry. This meant that Zhao Yufei would only get the Inner Strength skill, but would have no connections with Lightly Floating Ferry.After he finished writing it down, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei exchanged skills.The old man took over Air Crossing Breathing Technique and started to inspect it. Zhao Feng used his left eye and quickly scanned through the contents of Metal Wall Technique as well. He had over one hundred skills in his mind, which meant that his theory of Martial Arts wasn\u2019t bad.He only had to scan the contents once to fully memorise them. It was obvious that this skill far exceeded the ones inside his head.\u201cNot bad, this skill is very compatible with Zhao Yufei.\u201d The one-armed old man said joyfully as he finished reading.\u201cHehe, I am happy to cooperate.\u201d Zhao Feng put away the Metal Wall Technique and was happy as well.However, before Zhao Feng left he couldn\u2019t help restraining himself and asked, \u201cSenior, why don\u2019t you let sister Yufei learn the Metal Wall Technique?\u201dThe old man laughed, \u201cYou\u2019re a genius of the sect and you do not know? Just from the name \u2018Metal Wall Technique\u2019 one can tell that one\u2019s skin will become tough as metal, which means it will not be suitable for women. Yufei agile and soft style is more compatible with your Air Crossing Breathing Technique, or else I would not have traded Metal Wall Technique for it.\u201dNo wonder. hao Feng nodded his head, the Metal Wall Technique was indeed not suitable for women. Images of Yufei turning into a muscular woman made Zhao Feng shiver.After returning home, Zhao Feng immediately started to train in the Metal Wall Technique. Normal body strengthening techniques were easy to understand. This Metal Wall Technique however was not a normal technique . Just to understand it far exceeded other high ranked martial arts.However, this didn\u2019t trip Zhao Feng as he gently used his left eye to merge the contents into his mind and played them back and forth.That night Zhao Feng finally stepped into the doorway of the Metal Wall Technique.The Metal Wall Technique had a total of seven levels.The first three levels allowed one\u2019s skin to harden. After reaching the third level, one\u2019s skin would be as hard as metal and would be able to block swords. It could be seen that this skill was far more complex than Zhao Yue\u2019s Metal Body.Zhao Yue\u2019s Metal Body had to gather one\u2019s strength onto a certain point to block swords.\u201cThe fourth level, using Inner Strength to harden one\u2019s bones, which allows one to increase one\u2019s power rapidly. Just from one\u2019s body alone one can counter against weapons and Inner Strength. Once reaching here, the whole body will be as strong as a metal wall.\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s eyes started to shine as he read up to here.This body strengthening skill could increase one\u2019s power.If I can cultivate Metal Wall Technique to the fourth level, I will have a seventy percent chance to reach top three. Zhao Feng thought.The fifth level: Reaching this level, one\u2019s body can shatter weapons.The sixth level: One can withstand any attack from the seventh rank of the martial path and be uninjured.The seventh level: A perfect body that will not melt under extreme heat.\u2026\u2026.After reading the last few parts, Zhao Feng was shocked. Especially the seventh level, it had almost reached a non-human degree!When put in furnaces and not able to melt, what kind of concept was this? If one body was made of skin, blood and bone, they would still melt when tossed into a furnace.If one could train Metal Wall Technique to the seventh level, no one under the ninth level would be able to harm one.\u201cI think I\u2019ve gotten a great deal.\u201d Zhao Feng was excited as he doubled his efforts to train this skill. Since he had already understood Inner Strength and had reached the fourth rank already, Zhao Feng\u2019s training speed was extremely fast.It only took him one day to reach the first level.Zhao Feng found that his skin became stronger after reaching the first level.This was very obvious!However, after he reached the first level he found out that the speed decreased dramatically.Zhao Feng estimated that he needed at least ten days to reach the second level.There are ten more days until the main family tournament starts. Zhao Feng thought, he then decided to head back to the Medicine Pavilion and buy some \u2018Body Strengthening Powder.\u201d Each pouch of Body Strengthening Powder cost two thousand silver and could only be used three times to increase his body strengthening skill speed.Zhao Feng clenched his teeths as he purchased three bags, worth six thousand silver.With the rest of the silver, he bought a \u201cAir Pill\u201d, which also cost him six thousand silver.Everyone knew that the effect of \u201cAir pill\u201d was to increase the amount of Inner Strength one could store.It could be seen that Zhao Feng never forgot to cultivate his Inner Strength.Three pouches of Body Strengthening Powder and one Air Pill spent all of Zhao Feng\u2019s saving.After returning home, Zhao Feng immediately opened one pouch of Body Strengthening Powder and started to cultivate Metal Wall Technique as he soaked in the medicine. A hot feeling started to ignite within his body as he soaked in the medicine.And as time went on, a fiery feeling started to sink into his body. Suddenly, a weird but familiar sound sounded.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPeh! Peh!The depth of Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye started to release sizzles of heat which merged with the medicine.Hu~A queer hot feeling reverberated within his body and made his training speed increase.\u201cThis\u2026..\u201d Zhao Feng was shocked but wasted no time in absorbing the energy within the medicine.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 31": "Chapter 31Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 31 \u2013 Sky Forest Murderous IntentWhat is going on? Zhao Feng felt that his left eye was jumping and his blood seemed to undergo a certain change which allowed him to quickly absorb the energy.It was certain that Zhao Feng\u2019s ability to absorb medicine surpassed normal people. This was because a normal person needed three times to absorb one pouch of Body Strengthening Powder. However, Zhao Feng had only absorbed it once and all the energy had disappeared.Zhao Feng cringed when he thought that his two thousand silver had been spent in such a short period. It was good though, that all the energy had been absorbed by him.He felt that the Metal Wall Technique\u2019s training speed had increased dramatically.\u201cWhat kind of mutation has happened to my body? My absorption speed has greatly increased.\u201d Zhao Feng felt that his own body held secrets he did not know of. He could only confirm that all of this had something to do with his left eye.The next day, Zhao Feng first cultivated in the Air Crossing Breathing Technique a few times, then resumed using the Body Strengthening Powder.In only three days, the Metal Wall Technique had reached the second level. However, his six thousand silver worth of Body Strengthening Powder had all been used up.The first two levels of the Metal Wall Technique did not improve Zhao Feng\u2019s overall strength by much. His power had increased, but his defense had only increased by about 20-30%.This was mainly due to the fact that Zhao Feng\u2019s foundation being very strong. If he had reached the second level before he reached the fourth rank of the martial path, then the increase in strength would have been very obvious.\u201cOnly the third level allows for one\u2019s body to become as hard as metal, and block weapons. This allows one\u2019s defense to greatly increase.\u201dZhao Feng wanted to reach it, but his Body Strengthening Powder had all been used and his training speed in the Metal Wall Technique went back to the speed of a turtle.Money, money, money. Zhao Feng sighed. All his savings were now gone. He was now broke.Thinking up to here, he took out the Air pill that he bought a few days ago. The use of the Air pill was to refine one\u2019s Inner Strength, which helped Martial Artists a lot.Zhao Feng immediately ate the pill and started to cultivate in the Air Crossing Breathing Technique. The Air Crossing Breathing Technique was so outstanding that Zhao Yufei grandfather even took out the Metal Wall Technique to exchange for it. And with the mental energy he gained from his left eye, Zhao Feng could cultivate for twice as long as he could before, therefore allowing for his Inner Strength to increase at an immense speed.Zhao Feng once again felt heat come from his left eye which allowed for his absorption to increase.One day and one night later.Zhao Feng let out a breath as he raised his palm. A green faint glow spun slowly in circles, it also brought a powerful pressure with it.His Inner Strength had reached the peak fourth rank unknowingly. Because the Metal Wall Technique and Air Crossing Breathing Technique both proceeded at the same time, Zhao Feng\u2019s foundation began to get even more stable.He calculated that there were six to seven days left until the tournament.\u201cThe Metal Wall Technique is at the peak of the second level and my Inner Strength is comparable to the peak of the fourth rank. My cultivation is almost at the peak of the fourth rank as well.\u201d Zhao Feng evaluated his strength.With this strength, he had a 40-50% chance of reaching the top three. However, to win, Zhao Han only had a 30%, as well as a 70% chance of a draw by relying on the speed of Lightly Floating Ferry.Not good enough! Zhao Feng shook his head, the chance to win was too low.Whether or not it was to defeat Zhao Han or to reach the top three, he had to increase his strength. However, acting on the normal ways to cultivate, his cultivation and Metal Wall Technique would be hard to improve.\u201cIt looks like I have to go to the Sky Cloud Forest again.\u201d Zhao Feng said after thinking deeply. He immediately retrieved a long rectangular box within the room.A silver bow laid within the wooden box. This silver bow was the one Zhao Feng had bought at Sun Feather City. Only true martial artists could truly utilise its strength.With the bow in hand, Zhao Feng left the Zhao sect. He then bought some items in Sun Feather City before heading towards Sky Cloud Forest.As soon as he left Sun Feather City three shadows flashed at the city gates before leaving. Two of these black-clothed people had black skin and looked similar.\u201cBig brother! That kid is probably going to Sky Cloud Forest.\u201d One of the black-clothed person said urgently.\u201cVery good. It is the perfect place for us to do our job. This plan ensures that this kid will definitely die!\u201d The big brother said full of killing intent.\u2026\u2026.Zhao Feng could train Lightly Floating Ferry whenever he liked when there was no one around.He was as light as a feather floating through the wind, sometimes double jumping in midair.Finally, today, Lightly Floating Ferry reached the low level.Teng! Teng!\u2026..In this open area he felt free like a bird.I am only at the fourth rank of the martial path and have such feeling. If I surpass the ninth rank, will I be able fly? Zhao Feng thought excitedly.Half an hour later, Zhao Feng finally reached Sky Cloud Forest.The endless forest looked like the open mouth of a deadly beast. No one knows what lies at the deepest parts of Sky Cloud Forest. All Zhao Feng knew was that the further one went, the more likely one was to met deadly beasts. Opportunities and danger intertwined with each other.Zhao Feng cautiously scanned the area with his left eye for signs of unknown beasts. He occasionally met a few strong deadly beasts and flew thirty miles out.Zhao Feng took out his silver bow and put his Inner Strength into it. The string started to tremble with power.Sou\u2014-One silver arrows shot through the forest and hit a two-hundred kg wild pig, two-hundred metres out.Tonk!The arrow blasted through the pig\u2019s eye and head, spraying blood everywhere. It struggled for a while before falling down. The two-hundred kg pig would be a tough feat if fought head on by cultivators of the third rank.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t pick up the pig\u2019s corpse. He was just practising his skills with the bow. His real target was wild beasts. Only by killing wild beasts would he gain the silver he needed for cultivation resources.\u201cThe power of this silver bow is not bad. Every arrow\u2019s strength is on par with the full strength hit of a fourth rank within three hundred steps. My arrows also have poison coated on them. If I hit a vital spot it is the same damage as a fifth ranker.\u201d Zhao Feng was very pleased with himself. Being an archer, Zhao Feng\u2019s killing and surviving rate was very high.\u201cClap, clap, clap\u2026.. Not bad, not bad. I never thought my target this time would be an archer.\u201dA clapping sound came from in front.\u201cWho!\u201d Zhao Feng was shocked.He saw that on a tree top, two-hundred metres out, stood a slim as bones gary-clothed man. This person was like a ghost that hung on a tree. If one wasn\u2019t careful enough, one would think it was a rag.Through his left eye, Zhao Feng found that the person\u2019s aura was converged in a weird way, making the aura turn to nothingness.Through his first inspection the enemy had reached the fifth rank of the martial path and had also learned a skill similar to Hiding Air Technique, as well as another tracking skill.\u201cWho? Hehe\u2026 you\u2019re going to die soon, haven\u2019t you realised?\u201d The gray-clothed man mocked. He did not seem to have any intentions of attacking in a short amount of time. However, his eyes had always been locked on to Zhao Feng.Zhao Feng\u2019s hand held three poison arrows as he faced off the assassin.Why didn\u2019t he make a move?Zhao Feng felt weird. Soon however he got to know why.\u201cHahaha\u2026. Kid, come to your death!\u201dA few hundred metres behind him, two men, clothed in black, were coming. They had both reached the peak of the fourth rank.Two pronged attack!Zhao Feng\u2019s expression changed. However, the man that gave him the most dangerous feeling was the one in front of him.\u201cIt is time to end it now.\u201d A curve blade appeared in the gray-clothed man\u2019s hand.What should I do? Zhao Feng thought urgently.At this moment, from deep inside the left eye, came a familiar thumping sound. Under this danger, Zhao Feng fully pushed his left eye into max vision and reaction speed.\u201cKill!\u201dThe two men behind him were now one or two hundred metres away. Their every action slowed down in Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes.However, the gray-clothed man in front stood still like wood, not moving at all. Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye however was still locked onto this man as he was the most dangerous one of all.One hundred metres!The two black-clothed men were laughing hysterically. They seemed to already picture how Zhao Feng would be cut into pieces. However, Zhao Feng was still calm.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euSuddenly, Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye felt the blood and Inner Strength stirring within the gray-clothed man\u2019s body\u2026..At this moment!Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes flashed dangerously as he put the three poisonous arrows onto the bow.Sou! Sou! Sou!\u2014\u2013The three arrows were arranged in a queer position, like a triangle that shot towards the gray-clothed man.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 32": "Chapter 32Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 32 \u2013 Life or Death PursuitAs Zhao Feng pulled his bow, the gray-clothed man\u2019s expression turned into one of mockery.Sou! Sou! Sou! \u2014\u2013However, when those three arrows came right at him, his expression suddenly changed. These three poison arrows had small gaps between them and were not going in a straight line. However, the way that it was arranged meant that he had no escape routes, he was completely locked on!Pah!The gray-clothed man swiped his hand and a gust of wind snapped the first arrow, but the second arrow came right after.If he wanted to dodge the second arrow and then attack Zhao Feng using the best route possible, he would have to face the third arrow.The third arrow seemed to calculate how he would react.How did he do this\u2026\u2026 The gray-clothed man\u2019s pupil shrank as his expression turned to shock. If this was all planned by Zhao Feng, then this would be extremely frightening. He was a youth not even fourteen years of age!He did not know that Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye had already locked on him. Everything, including his heartbeat and breathing rate, was all under close watch.Zhao Feng had shot his arrows according to the changes in the opponent\u2019s body. Everything went to plan. The three arrows had stalled the gray-clothed man for a few breaths.\u201cThere is no difference. You will still die today.\u201d The gray-clothed man\u2019s voice was full of coldness.However, Zhao Feng\u2019s actions after that caused him to be stunned once again. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t run after he shot the three arrows. Instead, he turned around and attacked the two men behind him.Kill!The two black clothed men also attacked Zhao Feng.Since they were running towards each other in straight lines, the distance between them soon closed in.\u201cThis kid has strong calculation abilities.\u201d The gray-clothed man felt a bit anxious. Zhao Feng\u2019s actions had been the most perfect way to escape.Firstly, he didn\u2019t run straight away. His chances of escaping under the two groups of people was very low. At the very least, Zhao Feng had confirmed that the gray-clothed man\u2019s speed would not be slower than his own, or else he could not have appeared in front of him like a ghost.Secondly, it was very hard for Zhao Feng to find a breakthrough point.After comparing the three people, Zhao Feng thought that the two men clothed in black were weaker. If he could finish off these two quickly, and then concentrate on the gray-clothed man, his chances of winning would be higher.Just as Zhao Feng and the two men were getting closer.\u201cHow will a trivial half-step martial artist fight against two peak fourth rankers?\u201d The gray-clothed man didn\u2019t feel urgent. He didn\u2019t need the two men in black to kill Zhao Feng. All that he needed was for them to stall Zhao Feng for a while, then Zhao Feng would definitely die.Kill!Angry Dragon Fists!As Zhao Feng exchanged blows with the two black-clothed men his body perfectly passed through the gap between their attacks.Suddenly his aura increased dramatically.\u201cWhat! This guy is a true martial artist!\u201d The gray-clothed man\u2019s expression finally changed. Zhao Feng\u2019s aura had obviously shown that he had reached the fourth rank of the Martial Path.Pah!Zhao Feng\u2019s fist was like a roaring dragon that carried a faint green glow and smashed into the chest of one of the men clothed in black.Crack!The bones inside of him were instantly shattered and he immediately died.Zhao Feng\u2019s explosive Inner Strength had reached the peak of the fourth rank and Angry Dragon Fists had also reached its Max level.With that one fist he killed one of the men in black. This wasn\u2019t just because they looked down upon Zhao Feng, it was also because of Zhao Feng\u2019s strength and his left eye\u2019s calculations.\u201cLittle brother!\u201d The other man in black screamed angrily as his eyes turned red.Angry Dragon Fists!Zhao Feng immediately attacked the other man in black. To be merciful to the enemy meant being cruel to himself.\u201cI\u2019ll slice you ten thousand times for killing my little brother.\u201d The sword in the black clothed martial artist suddenly gave off extremely powerful Inner Strength as he furiously hacked towards Zhao Feng.\u201cStall him!\u201dThe gray-clothed man behind shouted.He only needed the person to stall Zhao Feng, not necessarily kill him. Unfortunately the black clothed man had lost his mind and attacked crazily. Zhao Feng fully utilised his left eye to find flaws of the opponent. However, his time was limited as the gray-clothed man behind him was catching up.Fight!Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t care about anything else as his body swiftly floated within range of the black clothed man\u2019s sword range.Crack!Zhao Feng finally landed one punch on the opponent\u2019s left shoulder.\u201cAh!\u201dAlthough the man\u2019s arm had been broken, he kept on attacking towards Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng punched him once again and shattered his throat.Plop!The man in black fell to the ground, dead.Zhao Feng had also paid a price for it. He had suffered some internal damage due to the man landing his last punch onto Zhao Feng\u2019s chest. After all, his Metal Wall Technique had not reached the third level yet, which meant that he could not take straight hits from cultivators of the same rank.\u201cLittle kid\u2026. You\u2019ve been hiding pretty deeply. Your true strength is close to the fifth rank of the Martial Path. However, you will still die today.\u201d At this moment the gray-clothed man had arrived.There was a dead silence as the two faced one another.\u201cWho sent you here? Was it Zhao Tianjian?\u201d Zhao Feng stared at the gray-clothed man. He was 80% certain that Zhao Tianjian was the mastermind.He only had one mortal enemy within Sun Feather City, and that was Zhao Tianjian and his son.\u201cHahaha\u2026. It doesn\u2019t matter whether it was or wasn\u2019t since you\u2019re going to die either way.\u201d The gray-clothed man laughed cruelly and moved like a ghost. The curved blade in his hand sliced towards Zhao Feng.Shua! Shua! Shua!Zhao Feng felt that the enemy had a high tier footwork skill and super fast attack speed. Only with the help of his left eye was he able to dodge these attacks. If it were someone else that had reached the fourth or fifth rank of the Martial Path, they would probably have already been killed.The thin curved blade in the gray-clothed man\u2019s hand was very sharp. Even Xin Tong\u2019s Bronze Skin wouldn\u2019t be able to block it.If Zhao Feng was to take one hit, he would definitely lose his life here. He was also trying to find flaws in the enemy. However, the gray-clothed man was very experienced and had been in many life-death situations, so he had few flaws.High ranked sword skill, high ranked footwork skill, high rank Inner Strength skill\u2026. All of them have reached the High level. His sword skill has almost reached the Peak level. While Zhao Feng barely managed to dodge he had also estimated the opponent\u2019s strength.The result made his heart go cold.The cultivation of the gray-clothed man had reached the peak of the fifth rank and was close to the sixth. With high tier martial arts he was definitely a peak fighter from the fifth ranks of the Martial Path.As the fight continued Zhao Feng felt his internal injury become worse.I will definitely die if we keep on fighting in close combat\u2026. Why not\u2026. Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes flashed as he thought of a plan.Teng!He suddenly exited the fight and pushed Lightly Floating Ferry and Air Crossing Breathing Technique to the max.Instantly he dashed through the trees and headed into the deeper parts of the Sky Cloud Forest.This time, since he exposed his strength, his Lightly Floating Ferry was faster than before by half.\u201cWhere are you running?\u201d The gray-clothed man exclaimed as he immediately followed.Zhao Feng started to calm down after running a few miles. The opponent, relying his cultivation and high ranked footwork skill which had reached the high level, had speed on par with himself.As Zhao Feng ran he opened a path for him by using his left eye, and tried to find obstacles that could stall the enemy behind him. Since his left eye could see further and clearer, Zhao Feng was like a fish in the water that swam swiftly without stopping.However the gray-clothed man was distracted by those obstacles, such as leaves and branches.\u201cHmph, although I cannot throw you off I can still take you further down into the Sky Cloud Forest and make us perish together.\u201d Zhao Feng said forcefully. He felt that as he ran Lightly Floating Ferry had some improvements.According to Zhao Feng\u2019s plan there were a few deadly beasts about.Roar~The deadly beasts roar caused the gray-clothed man\u2019s heart to jump.\u201cThis little bastard\u2026 hateful!\u201d The man in gray clenched his teeths. If the beasts were low tier, such as the fourth, fifth or sixth rank of the Martial Path, the gray-clothed man would be able to protect himself.However, if they were unlucky and met high tier deadly beasts, normal martial artists wouldn\u2019t even have the chance to run. That was because high tier deadly beasts had strengths comparable to Martial Masters, which were like the elders of the Zhao sect\u2026\u2026Zhao Feng\u2019s plan was very simple. To lead the gray-clothed man to places with more deadly beasts. Since his left eye had super-vision, Zhao Feng could easily see everything within a ten mile radius. When the two of them reached a place where there were deadly beasts, Zhao Feng would instantly hide in the dead corner of the beast so that the beast would find the gray-clothed man first.Roar! Roar!Zhao Feng led the gray-clothed man towards two \u201cSilver Striped Blood Leopards\u201d. These two Silver Striped Blood Leopards had nasty faces. They bodies were even bigger than the Green Headed Tiger King.Zhao Feng estimated that the Silver Striped Blood Leopard\u2019s strength was around the fifth rank of the Martial Path.As soon as they entered the Silver Striped Blood Leopard\u2019s territory and disturbed them, Zhao Feng immediately hid between the branches of a tree and quickly used Hiding Air Technique to erase his aura.His Hiding Air Technique had reached the high level and could now fully erase one\u2019s aura, including scent as well as dropping one\u2019s own body heat.Zhao Feng dodged through the two Silver Striped Blood Leopard\u2019s smell.The gray-clothed man pursuing behind however, was not so lucky. He did not have Zhao Feng\u2019s eyesight which could see everything within ten miles.Roar, roar! Hu\u2014-The two Silver Striped Blood Leopard\u2019s pounced towards the gray-clothed man.\u201cShameless kid!\u201d The gray-clothed man swore. He knew where Zhao Feng was but the two Silver Striped Leopard\u2019s had come for him instead.The Silver Striped Blood Leopard had amazing speed as they whipped through the branches. Their strengths were around the peak of the fifth rank.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euIf there was only one, the gray-clothed man could easily defeat it, but since there were two, it would be difficult.Just as the man in gray was being beaten by the Silver Striped Blood Leopards.\u201cHahaha\u2026..\u201dZhao Feng hidden between the gaps of a tree was laughing gloatingly. With his mysterious left eye, his survival rate was much higher than others.\u201cHehe, do not blame me for helping.\u201d Zhao Feng laughed darkly as he took the Silver Bow off his back and attached three poison arrows to it\u2026..Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Feng kept calm. He did not want to face off against the two Silver Striped Blood Leopard\u2019s as soon as he killed the man in gray.The man in gray was barely able to deal with the two deadly beasts, but he also used part of his energy to keep a lookout for Zhao Feng\u2019s tricks.Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but sigh. This person\u2019s was worthy of being an elite. In this situation he was still able to keep his guard up.Hong\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2013Right at this moment a slight tremble came from the ground as if there was a massive beast coming through.Si!The two Silver Striped Blood Leopards, who had a cultivation at the peak of fifth rank, immediately shuddered and stopped attacking.Roar!A frightening howl sounded throughout a ten mile radius. Uncountable wild beasts, and even some deadly beasts, trembled upon hearing it.What is that!? Zhao Feng felt his eardrums rattle. Just the roar made him become uneasy.Not good\u2026. The gray-clothed man seemed to realise something and his face instantly turned white. The man in gray knew more about Sky Cloud Forest than Zhao Feng.That is\u2026. Using his left eye, Zhao Feng saw a purple-black colored Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger, seven to eight metres high and tens of metres long, it looked like a small mountain. Such a size made one tremble in awe.In terms of length, the Green Headed Tiger King would be an infant compared to it. The most terrifying part however was the pair of jet black wings on the tiger\u2019s back, allowing it to fly.Hong\u2014-Trees would shatter to pieces wherever the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger went.\u201cTwo-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger\u2026. High tier deadly beast. Strength around the eighth rank of the Martial Path!\u201d The gray-clothed man trembled in fear.The aura of a high tier deadly beast would make one tremble in respect.Zhao Feng\u2019s legs unstoppably trembled. He couldn\u2019t control his body under the frightening aura.Roar!A loud roar came from the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger which now pounced towards the Silver Striped Blood Leopard and the man in gray.\u201cHelp me\u2026\u201d The gray-clothed man tried to resist.Crack!The Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger opened its mouth and swallowed a Silver Striped Blood Tiger whole. The scene made Zhao Feng\u2019s heart go cold. Zhao Feng even had the feeling that the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger knew of his existence.After the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger ate a Silver Striped Blood Leopard, its blood-purple colored eyes casually looked towards where Zhao Feng was hiding.What!? Zhao Feng felt his body turn cold.When a deadly beast reached the high tier, it was not to be under estimated. Have you ever seen a tiger with wings that is the size of a small mountain?Run! Run fast\u2026 If I don\u2019t run there won\u2019t be any chance left. Zhao Feng had the urge to survive. Under the frightening pressure Zhao Feng poured all his energy into his left eye. The left eye helped him him become calm again. It also released sizzles of heat that spread out evenly throughout his body.Zhao Feng felt the fear decrease.Run! His body turned into a blur as he ran towards a dead corner. However, Zhao Feng could still felt a deadly aura come crushing down on him.Crack!A scream came from behind. The other Silver Striped Blood Leopard had also died. In an instant, the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger had killed two deadly beasts of the peak fifth rank. There was only the man in gray left around.Run! The gray-clothed man ran in the other direction in despair.The Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger was slowly chewing the food in its mouth before he 'slowly\u201d and \u201cleisurely\u201d chased after the man in gray. Although the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger was going slow, the distance between the two was becoming shorter. The man in gray had a high ranked speed skill which he had trained to the high level, and under despair, his speed was faster even than Zhao Feng by one-half.On the other side, Zhao Feng\u2019s speed also exploded under the feeling of despair. His Lightly Floating Ferry was now even smoother.\u201cMy cultivation has reached the peak of the fourth rank\u2026.\u201d Although Zhao Feng felt his cultivation increase, he didn\u2019t feel any happiness from it. Because the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger\u2019s sense was extremely powerful. Even if one ran ten miles away one would still be found.Just at this moment, a shout came from behind.\u201cHeavenly Moon Cut!\u201dThe gray-clothed man used his final attack knowing that he would die. That sword\u2019s strength had reached the peak level. Not only that, the man\u2019s cultivation had broken through to the sixth rank.Shua!That blade of despair, which could kill almost any cultivator of the sixth rank, hit the body of the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger.Roar!The Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger opened its mouth and swallowed the man in gray and his weapons whole. As for that devastating Heavenly Moon Cut, it left a half an inch blood mark on the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger. For a creature of such size, this kind of attack was nothing more than a tickle.As the gray-clothed man died, Zhao Feng felt himself become shrouded in death\u2026 The Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger\u2019s next aim was him!It was good that there was still a gap between them, and that the tiger was only slowly chasing him. The Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger also ate some wild and deadly beasts as it chased after him.Zhao Feng originally thought that since the tiger was full, it would let him go. However, the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger seemed to be playing with him, slowly but surely pursuing behind.\u201cThis bastard!\u201d Zhao Feng swore as he used his left eye to find a route for survival.Suddenly, a small creek appeared on his left hand side. It lead into a canyon.Zhao Feng found that there was a deep cave ten miles into the canyon. The Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger wouldn\u2019t be able to fit inside that cave. Zhao Feng soon changed direction and ran towards the creek.Teng! Teng! Teng\u2026.Zhao Feng\u2019s feet lightly stepped on top of the water as he crossed the creek. He had already trained Lightly Floating Ferry to such a level that walking on water wasn\u2019t hard at all.Hu! Hu!The Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger suddenly flapped its wings as it pounced towards Zhao Feng.Run! Zhao Feng sprinted straight towards the cave.The tiger wasn\u2019t technically a flying beast so it\u2019s flying speed wasn\u2019t fast. Adding onto the fact that it was full, it could not fly that fast. However it still pursued Zhao Feng.The cave came closer and closer.Ten miles\u2026. Nine miles\u2026. Eight miles\u2026.Just as there was one to two miles left, Zhao Feng felt a cold and dark aura.Hu!The aura came from within the canyon!Si~The weird sound caused Zhao Feng\u2019s heart to tremble. The tiger behind him also hesitated. It was obvious that it was being wary as well.Hu~Long~Suddenly, a loud tremble came from within the canyon. A blood-red python, tens of metres long, came out from within the cave. The aura of this python wasn\u2019t any weaker than the tiger\u2019s.\u201cAh\u2026..\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s body froze. There was a python in front and a tiger behind. This was even worse than before!Luckily the python\u2019s attention was first attracted by the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger.The two creatures faced one another. The Two-Winged Tiger roared in midair, as if showing its dominance. The blood-red python hissed back. This was its territory! As for Zhao Feng, this weakling was ignored.After facing each other for a while, the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger finally lost its patience and pounced towards the blood-red python.Sou\u2014-The python jumped straight towards the tiger. Immediately, the two deadly beasts fought each other. Where they fought, the ground trembled.Zhao Feng cautiously concealed his aura as he slowly moved towards the cave.Si! Roar!Suddenly the two beasts began to bite each other. The bloody scene made Zhao Feng\u2019s heart jump.Some time later, the movements of the two beasts finally became smaller and smaller.Half an hour later, there was dead silent within the canyon. Zhao Feng let out a long breath as he slowly moved towards the bodies of the two deadly beasts. He had also confirmed that the two beasts were dead with his left eye.Zhao Feng sighed as he arrived in front of the small mountain sized beasts. He couldn\u2019t take them back with him to Sun Feather City.Suddenly a cold light caught his eye.Yi!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng bent down and pulled out a curved blade from the tiger\u2019s corpse. This curved blade was the gray-man\u2019s weapon. It was extremely sharp.Roar~The deadly beasts and wild beasts nearby started to howl. Zhao Feng used his left eye to scan the area and was immediately shocked.There were over thirty beasts at the sixth rank of the Martial Path closing in.Not good. The corpses of these two high tier deadly beasts must have attracted other beasts. Zhao Feng immediately took the curved blade and ran towards the blood-red python\u2019s cave\u2026.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 34": "Chapter 34Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 34 \u2013 Leaps and BoundsAs Zhao Feng entered the cave, he immediately felt cold.As he went deeper, the area inside the cave increased. There were some deadly beasts and wild beasts inside the cave, but they were all weak. As he could see them from far away, he used his silver bow to pick them off.When they got close, he would use his new curved blade. The blade would easily slice through the deadly beasts.Soon, a blood-red rock wall appeared and under the red rock wall, there was a blood-red pond. Time to time, there were bubbles popping on the surface of the pond.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know what the red liquid was, but he felt that its aura was similar to that of the python\u2019s.\u201cBlood plant, Blood Spirit Grass, Blood Bamboo rock\u2026 Three hundred years old, five hundred years old, one thousand years old\u2026 \u201dZhao Feng laughed as his eyes rested upon the red rock.Some treasured medicines grew on the rock wall and the oldest one had reached one thousand years. As Zhao Feng had once eaten two and three hundred year old resources, he obviously knew the worth of these medicines.A normal five hundred year old blood plant was worth twenty-thousand or so.As for blood plants and blood spirit grasses over one thousand years of age, there weren\u2019t any in stock in Sun Feather City.Zhao Feng roughly calculated that there were around twenty three hundred year old plants, over ten five hundred year plants and three one thousand year old plants.\u201cFive hundred year old plants are great for normal martial artists. As for thousand year old plants, they are even rare for cultivators of the sixth rank and Martial Masters (7th rank and higher).\u201dZhao Feng couldn\u2019t restrain his happiness.When one didn\u2019t die there was definitely luck coming your way.Zhao Feng had been in a life death situation, but he survived. And in despair, he came to this land of luck.As Zhao Feng walked towards the red rock wall, he didn\u2019t pick the precious plants immediately.His eyesight focused on the red pond.There was some dead skin of a python lying next to the pond. As for the liquid, it flowed from the rock wall.\u201cFor the red rock wall to grow such precious materials, it can be seen that the liquid is definitely not normal.\u201dZhao Feng stared in excitement. He cautiously bent down and touched the red liquid. Suddenly, there was a jump from his left eye. The blood red liquid effect was even better than the Body Strengthening Powder.\u201cGreat!\u201dThe blood-red pond was the source in which the rock wall was able to grow such rare resources.Plop!Zhao Feng immediately jumped in the pond.Gulugulu!Zhao Feng felt a hot and spicy energy entering his pores.Wu~Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t restrain himself from moaning in pleasure.\u201cThe energy from this pond is much more stronger than the body strengthening powder I bought.\u201dZhao Feng circulated Air Crossing Breathing Technique and Metal Wall Technique at the same time.The blood-red liquid was very mysterious. It could not only help strengthen one\u2019s body, it could also increase one\u2019s Inner Strength.Time flowed.Under the help of the liquid, Zhao Feng felt the level of his Air Crossing Breathing Technique and Metal Wall Technique increase dramatically.However, over seventy percent of the energy had been absorbed by his bones, blood, and skin.Around half a day later.Zhao Feng felt his Metal Wall Technique finally progress from the peak of the second level to the third level.At that moment, he felt that his skin was as strong as bronze and that his bones were even harder.\u201cMetal Wall Technique has reached the third level. My defense has doubled and my strength has increased by one hundred and fifty to two hundred kgs.\u201dZhao Feng was very satisfied. If the Metal Wall Technique was fully consolidated at the third level, his body could face swords and blades straight on.After reaching the third level Zhao Feng rested for a few hours more in the red liquid. At this moment, his cultivation had reached the peak of the fourth rank and his Inner Strength was approaching the fifth rank.In the life and death situation in the Sky Cloud Forest before, his cultivation had reached the peak of the fourth rank. Even the man in gray had reached the sixth rank before he died.\u201cIt looks like that one\u2019s potential can be drawn out best when they are in life and death situations.\u201dAfter Metal Wall Technique was fully consolidated, he jumped out of the pond and walked to the entrance of the cave.Roar\u2026 Kong\u2026 Raaaar\u2026Deadly beasts and stronger wild beasts were killing each other for the corpse of the two high tier deadly beasts.Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but sigh as he thought about the worth of high tier deadly beasts. They were worth more than twenty times than the price of a low tier deadly beast.But these deadly beasts and wild beasts could eat the corpses of the two high tier deadly beasts to increase their own strength. Zhao Feng was scared to face so many beasts, so he retreated back to the pond.\u201cI\u2019ll just train a bit more here then.\u201dZhao Feng lay down in the blood pond and started to cultivate again. The use of the blood-red pond was very helpful. Once he left, he wouldn\u2019t have the chance to come back.Another half day later.Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation and Inner Strength were both extremely close to the fifth rank of the Martial Path. Inside his left eye, the green glow had reached four foot nine.\u201cI can try to break through to the fifth rank soon.\u201dZhao Feng jumped out of the pond and started to perform Angry Dragon Fists. Angry Dragon Fists had already been trained to the Max level. Now, the power of some moves had exceeded the original limit. From a different point of view, it could be said that this was a new martial art now.Zhao Feng felt like he was burning.Teng!Zhao Feng picked a five hundred year old blood plant off the red rock wall.When a normal martial artist reached the peak of a rank, they couldn\u2019t break through to the next rank immediately. This was because there was a problem called a bottleneck.Zhao Feng\u2019s point of using the blood plant was to open this bottleneck. The five hundred year blood plant had much more energy compared to the three hundred year old blood plant. As Zhao Feng ate it, he immediately felt the energy run chaotically throughout his body.He immediately circulated Air Crossing Breathing Technique to absorb the energy.One day and one night later.Zhao Feng felt his blood mix with his Inner Strength. He felt more and more threads of Inner Strength being formed.\u201cThe amount of Inner Strength I have has almost doubled since I\u2019ve broke through to the fifth rank. My body\u2019s attributes have obviously been increased as well.Zhao Feng could see the changes throughout his body with his left eye.Soon. He consolidated his realm and absorbed the remnants of the medicine. Adding Inner Strength onto his Air Crossing Breathing Technique, his speed had reached a whole new level. Zhao Feng\u2019s overall strength had undergone dramatic changes due to the breakthrough.If he met the gray-clothed man now, he was certain that he could fight and win.Cultivation was the base strength. As the base strength increases, the Inner Strength, speed and skills will have much more power.After a day of consolidation, Zhao Feng had once again returned to the cave entrance.Wu~ Roar\u2014\u2013A piercing scream came from within the canyon. Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t stop himself from trembling.That was\u2026His expression changed.Inside the canyon, a seven to eight metre long Azure Eyed Hyena stood in it. The hyena released its deadly aura and it made all the wild and deadly beasts within a ten mile radius cower in fear.It was obvious that the Azure Eyed Hyena was also a high tier deadly beast. It\u2019s strength wasn\u2019t any weaker than the Blood-red Python or the Two-Winged Sword Teeth Tiger.The Hyena immediately spotted Zhao Feng as soon as he peaked out of the cave and like the wind, it came pouncing towards him immediately.What speed!Zhao Feng\u2019s pupil contracted as he activated his Inner Strength and retreated back into the cave.Hong\u2014\u2014-The cave began to shake as the Hyena crashed into the entrance. The shock wave caused Zhao Feng to groan in pain.\u201cHigh tier deadly beasts. What power!\u201dBecause he had been circulating his Inner Strength and he had reached the third level of the Metal Wall Technique, he was unharmed.If it was a cultivator of the fourth rank of the Martial Path, the shockwave alone could have almost killed them.Peng\u2026.The Azure Eyed Hyena repeatedly attacked the entrance.Zhao Feng felt like a mountain was shaking. It was good that the entrance was hard enough. However, the entrance was small compared to the Azure Eyed Hyena and after a few attacks, the entrance began to crumble instead.Boom!The entrance crumbled.Ah!Zhao Feng\u2019s face turned black. After a few more trembles, the Azure Eyed Hyena left the entrance.However, Zhao Feng could still feel its aura. After the Blood-red Python died, this was now the Hyena\u2019s territory.Even if Zhao Feng managed to dig outside he would still have to face a strong enemy. After thinking about it for a while, he decided to return back to the depths of the cave.The cave still had small animals and beasts which could be used for food.Plop!Zhao Feng jumped back into the blood-red pond and he started to concentrate on training Metal Wall Technique again.The red liquid had great benefits for the body. Zhao Feng felt his body undergo subtle changes.Peh! Peh!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe thumping inside his left eye released sizzles of heat throughout his body, which made his absorption of the red liquid increase.One hour\u2026 two hours\u2026 Three hours\u2026Zhao Feng felt his body become harder and harder.Half a day\u2026 One day\u2026 Two days\u2026Finally, after two days, Zhao Feng reached the fourth level of the Metal Wall Technique.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 35": "Chapter 35Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 35 \u2013 Beginning of the main tournament (1)The first three levels were the foundation of Metal Wall Technique. Every level after that will give the cultivator a massive increase in power.Once this body martial art was trained to the fourth level, the cultivator\u2018s body was as tough as a metal wall and it was impenetrable.This meant that Zhao Feng could counter Xin Fei alone with his body and most cultivators of the fourth and fifth rank couldn\u2019t harm him.The fourth level of the Metal Wall Technique not only strengthened the skin, it also strengthened the bones by molding them inside, which meant that the cultivator\u2019s strength far surpassed others of the same rank.Zhao Feng felt that the change within his body was very obvious. Without using Inner Strength, his every move and action would still contain unstoppable power.\u201cI can easily beat cultivators of the fourth rank with just my body. I can even counter against some fifth rankers.\u201dZhao Feng took a deep breath and examined his body. At this moment, Zhao Feng finally realised the greatness of a body martial skill.If he had first trained Metal Wall Technique to the fourth level, he wouldn\u2019t have had a hard time fighting the three assassins.Teng!Zhao Feng jumped out of the pond and consolidated his foundation. Then, he crept towards the entrance. The entrance had been fully blocked by the fallen stones. However, Zhao Feng could still see the scenery outside through the gaps.\u201cIt still hasn\u2019t left yet?!\u201d Zhao Feng scrunched up his eyebrows. The Azure Eyed Hyena was lying inside the canyon, sleeping. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t dare make any suspicious moves. All he did was move some of the smaller rocks aside.Wu~~~Just at this moment, the Azure Eyed Hyena howled. Zhao Feng felt helpless as he returned back to the cave. Being a high tier deadly beast, the Azure Eyed Hyena had extreme sense. Trying to bluff through it wasn\u2019t easy.\u201cThere is still two more days till the main tournament starts.\u201d Zhao Feng was slightly aggravated as he soaked inside the pond.He couldn\u2019t forcefully break through. The strength of the Azure Eyed Hyena was at the eighth rank of the martial path. Any cultivators under the seventh rank would be instantly killed.Every three ranks was a huge difference. For example, a cultivator at the peak of the sixth rank would easily lose to a cultivator that had reached the seventh rank, under the same circumstances. (Skills etc)The Hyena was a Martial Master as it had reached the eighth rank. Even some of the sect\u2019s elders couldn\u2019t beat it.Zhao Feng decided that if he couldn\u2019t get out, he should just cultivate. Lying in the pond he circulated Air Crossing Breathing Technique and Metal Wall Technique again. Although the red liquid still greatly helped Metal Wall Technique, the increase was now much slower than before.Two days passed by in a blink. Zhao Feng\u2019s Metal Wall Technique had increased by leaps and bounds again, although it didn\u2019t reach the fifth level. Throughout that period, he had eaten a five hundred year old blood plant and a five hundred year old blood bamboo rock.Zhao Feng then ate a blood spirit grass and felt his Inner Strength purify into a higher quality.With the help of the blood plant and the red pond, the level of his Inner Strength had reached the peak of the fifth rank, it wasn\u2019t any weaker than Zhao Han\u2019s.The use of the blood bamboo rock was even more helpful. It helped excrete the poison in one\u2019s body. Having used so many treasured resources, there were some poison inside his body and he had some small internal injuries. But after using the blood bamboo shoot, he felt himself excrete a thick black liquid multiple times, which helped him get rid of the poison and he felt the internal injuries heal.At this moment,, Zhao Feng\u2019s Inner Strength was at the peak of the fifth rank and his cultivation was closing on the peak fifth rank as well. His Metal Wall Technique was almost at the peak of the fourth level.But he didn\u2019t feel happy at all.\u201cToday is the start of the main tournament.\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head sadly. He was still trapped within the cave and he couldn\u2019t get out.The same time.Sun Feather City, Zhao sect.All the elite inner disciples had showed up. First place Zhao Linlong, Second place Zhao Chi, Third place Zhao Han \u2026All the geniuses had arrived.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t he here yet?\u201d Zhao Yufei beautiful eyes scanned around the place, but she couldn\u2019t see Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng had finally reached the fourth rank of the martial path after half a month. This included the help of Air Crossing Breathing Technique and precious resources \u2026On the stage, there were fifty chairs arranged in five rows. On the seats sat fifty inner disciples. The fifty chairs represented the fifty spots of inner disciples.The first three chair owners were the top three disciples of the Zhao sect. All of them had at least reached the fifth rank of the martial path. By looking at their auras, it could be seen that Zhao Chi and Zhao Han had both recently reached the fifth rank.As for the number one disciples Zhao Linlong, he had never opened his eyes from the start, making him all the more mysterious.He never opened his eyes to watch any fights.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t the top outer disciple Zhao Feng here?\u201d\u201cYea, I heard that he beat a cultivator of the fourth rank only using the strength of a half-step martial artist.\u201d The sect disciples discussed. Only a small number of people from the Zhao sect high level realised Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t here.On the stage.\u201cIf he was here and was the fourth rank of the martial path at least, he would be able to reach top five without a problem\u2026 \u201d One white-bearded old man murmured to himself. This white-bearded old man was the main judge of the outer disciples contest, the one who had blocked Zhao Tianjian\u2019s attack.Today he was also one of the two main judges of the main tournament.\u201cHmph. If he can arrive, then the sun must be coming from the South.\u201d Zhao Tianijan\u2019s eyes flashed violently, but then he thought suspiciously: \u201cBut why hasn\u2019t \u201cGrey Eagle\u201d, the one that took the mission, reported back yet?\u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.Inside the Sky Cloud Forest, in the cave.Zhao Feng was clinging onto the last string of hope. Time passed slowly. He was certain that the main tournament had now started. With the Azure Eyed Hyena guarding outside, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t dare to make any rash moves.All he could do was duly cultivate Metal Wall Technique and Air Crossing Breathing Technique.Another day passed by in a flash. Zhao Feng\u2019s Metal Wall Technique had reached the peak of the fourth level. His Inner Strength had reached the limit of the fifth rank. Even his cultivation was slowly proceeding towards the peak of the fifth rank.\u201cOne day has passed from the start of the main tournament.\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t have any hope left. Although the inner disciple tournament was important, it wasn\u2019t as important as his own life.Furthermore, if he had enough strength, he wouldn\u2019t need to fear anyone when he returned back to the sect.Roar\u2014-From inside the canyon came a shout.Hm?Zhao Feng immediately jumped out of the pond. That sound clearly came from the Azure Eyed Hyena.\u201cI\u2019ll go and check it out.\u201d Zhao Feng used Lightly Floating Ferry and arrived at the cave entrance. Through the cracks, he saw the scenes from the canyon. From the other side of the canyon, a few humans appeared.Humans!Zhao Feng first was happy, then his mood dropped again. Only Martial Masters would be able to take on high tier deadly beasts. Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye saw that three miles away from the cave, there were two men and one women. Their ages were around seventeen or eighteen, the oldest was around twenty.With their age, it was almost impossible for them to be a martial master. In Zhao Feng\u2019s mind, the sect\u2019s elders had all reached seventy or eighty.But the Hyena seemed to be wary of the people. The three people all wore the same clothes, it seemed that there were from the same faction. As they were three or four miles away, Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t hear their voices as his ears weren\u2019t as biased as his eye.At this time, the youth at the front said faintly: \u201cThis bastard seems to have some intelligence.\u201d\u201cNo challenge at all.\u201d The other youth said disdainfully.\u201cLeave it to me.\u201d The girl said.\u201cSure, little sister Yuan. Your actual combat skills are too weak, you can\u2019t even kill it in one move.\u201d The youth at the front said.\u2026\u2026If Zhao Feng could hear what they were saying he would be shocked. Soon, he watched the girl walk towards the high tier deadly beast.Wu~~~The Azure Eyed Hyena pounced towards the girl.Oh my god!Zhao Feng was stunned. That girl was going to die!Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye was pushed to the maximum. The whole world slowed down by tens of times.\u201cBreak!\u201dThe girl in his vision floated up. Her jade hands lightly swiped the air and a azure coloured light formed in her hands, and then it flew at the head of the Hyena.Ssss\u2014\u2014The tougher than metal skin of the Azure Eyed Hyena was easily sliced open. The Hyena screamed as his head exploded.Hong\u2014\u2013The corpse fell to the ground.Zhao Feng was shocked. His left eye was still thumping. Inside the pitch black dimension of his eye, the green light split into two figures. One of them was the Hyena, while the other was the girl.The two figures closed in on each other. The girl waved simply waved her hand. Her attack contained insight too deep for Zhao Feng to understand and it killed the Hyena in one hit.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe scene in his mind was replayed back and forth, Zhao Feng stood dazed as if he was in a trance. He was so concentrated that he didn\u2019t even notice the three people leaving.\u201cLittle sister Yuan, although your opponent was very weak the power of that move wasn\u2019t bad.\u201d The youth at the front praised.\u2026..When Zhao Feng opened his eyes. There was no one left inside the canyon, only the corpse of the Azure Eyed Hyena. Everything that happened was like a dream.But if he opened his left eye, the scene of the girl killing the high tier deadly beast would be replayed back and forth\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 36": "Chapter 36Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 36 \u2013 Beginning of the main tournament (2)\u201cWhere are those people from?\u201d Zhao Feng thought that everything was surreal.Unexpectedly, his left eye had opened a new ability: It could memorise any scene he saw and replay it perfectly.If Zhao Feng was willing, he could open the scene and try to gain some insights. He knew that his knowledge of the outside world was limited. The Azure Flower continent had a countless number of countries. Just Sky Cloud Forest alone passed through more than ten countries. Sun Feather City was just a small city within a country.Regaining his composure Zhao Feng soon turned happy. Now that the Hyena was dead, nothing could stop him from leaving.I need to leave fast. Zhao Feng felt anxious as he thought about the main tournament.The cave entrance was blocked by rocks. All he needed to do was open up a path.Peng!The smaller rocks were only about one-hundred and fifty kg\u2019s heavy. Just with his body alone, he could crush the rocks. If he added Inner Strength to it, the rocks would be shattered.When Zhao Feng met larger rocks, he started to push them aside. Normal fifth rankers had seven hundred and fifty kg\u2019s of strength by using their body alone. Because Zhao Feng had trained the Metal Wall Technique to the fourth level, he had at least one thousand two-hundred and fifty kg\u2019s of power, five hundred more than what normal cultivators of the fifth rank had. Obviously, the main use of Metal Wall Technique was to help increase one\u2019s defense and not increase one\u2019s power.Zhao Feng finally opened the path up in half an hour. However, he didn\u2019t leave immediately. There were still some precious resources left on the red rock wall.Raaah! Roar!At this moment, some deadly beasts and wild beasts began to scream.\u201cThe body of the high tier deadly beast will attract more beasts.\u201d Having been through this for the first time, Zhao Feng immediately increased his speed. Like a rocket, he flew to the rock wall and took some of the plants. There was only one aim for him: to take the three one thousand year old plants. The thousand year blood plant, thousand year blood spirit grass, and the thousand year blood bamboo rock.He had many reasons in why he did this: Firstly, he could save time. There were many beasts gathering. Secondly, although the three hundred and five hundred year old plants were precious, Zhao Feng had already eaten many of them, so their effects weren\u2019t that obvious for him.Ceng!He didn\u2019t dare stop after he took the plants.Entering the canyon, there were already seven or eight deadly beasts fighting each other. There were also thirty strong wild beasts here, all of them had the strength of a fourth rank. Zhao Feng tried his best to dodge the beasts and headed straight towards the creek.Although he tried to dodge the beasts, there were still some wild and deadly beasts that came for him.\u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201d Zhao Feng shouted as his palm hit a low tier deadly beast.Craaack!The bones of the low tier deadly beast was instantly shattered. This attack of his was pure muscle, not a bit of Inner Strength used. The low tier deadly beast was slightly stronger than the Green Headed Tiger King he\u2019d first met when he came to the Sky Cloud Forest.Killing the beast in one hit caused the other wild beasts to scatter in fear and according to his memory, Zhao Feng made his way back the way he came.On the way, he again met many deadly beasts. This was because the high tier deadly beast\u2019s corpse just attracted way too many other animals.\u201cFlaming Metal Fist!\u201d Zhao Feng shouted as a faint green glow poured out from his fist. The fist hit a low tier deadly beast whose strength was equal to a cultivator of the fifth rank. Under this one punch, the low tier deadly beast had its organs shattered.With the use of the blood spirit grass, blood-red pond, his Inner Strength was much stronger than the Inner Strength of others. When he fully circulated Air Crossing Breathing Technique, he could instantly kill a cultivator of the same rank.One hour later.Zhao Feng finally reached the outer edges of the Sky Cloud Forest and rushed back towards Sun Feather City.\u201cI heard that the Zhao sect main tournament is ending soon.\u201d\u201cThe main tournament is divided into \u201cRanking challenge\u201d and the \u201cSpot challenge (Out of the one hundred people only fifty will be Inner disciples)\u201d. The latter should be finished now. I\u2019m so sad I couldn\u2019t get to watch.\u201dOn the way he heard some information about what was going on. After he returned to the sect, he didn\u2019t immediately go towards the place where the main tournament was held, instead he first returned home and put the three one thousand year old plants away.Soon, he changed his clothes then rushed out the door. Zhao Feng used his Hiding Air Technique to show that his cultivation was only at the peak fourth rank. As for his Inner Strength, it was shown to be at the fifth rank.\u201cThis is the best I can do.\u201d Zhao Feng soon arrived at the place by using Lightly Floating Ferry.At this moment, the tournament seemed to be in the second stage.\u201cAfter one day of intense fighting, the \u201cSpot challenge\u201d has ended and the fifty inner disciples have been decided. The \u201cRanking challenge\u201d will be next. The fifty of you left will challenge one another to find out the overall ranking and according to your ranks, the prizes will be given.\u201d A powerful and old voice reverberated.In the middle of the site, there was an arena. Opposite the arena, there was a stage.There were fifty seats on the stage and on each seat sat one person, representing an inner disciple.The first round \u201cSpot challenge\u201d was when the fifty outer disciples challenged the fifty inner disciples, to try and get an inner disciple spot. Zhao Feng scanned and found that from the outer disciples, Zhao Yufei, Zhao Yue and Zhao Guang had all reached the top fifty.However, their ranks were all in the last ten. Only Zhao Yufei reached the top twenty. Obviously, this was the \u201cSpot challenge\u201d rankings, and not the real rankings.\u201cI still came late.\u201d Zhao Feng used his identity card and passed through the checkpoint.\u201cIt\u2019s Zhao Feng!\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s him, the top outer disciple!\u201d Zhao Feng immediately attracted the crowd\u2019s attention.\u201cJudge, can I still participate?\u201d Zhao Feng said as he puffed.\u201cNo matter who you are, you cannot join since the first round of the tournament is over.\u201d The judge said. He didn\u2019t think that Zhao Feng needed special attention.\u201cHm? It\u2019s him!\u201d The white-bearded main judge\u2019s eyes lit up.He was the main judge of the outer disciples contest and had seen Zhao Feng dominate it.Hearing the judge\u2019s words, Zhao Feng shook his head helplessly. He wasn\u2019t very interested since there were only two to three people who were his match. But Zhao Feng was still interested by the rewards. If one reached the top three, they could could go to the Martial Arts Library and choose a peak ranked skill.\u201cWait.\u201d The voice came from the main judge.\u201cMain judge? What do you mean\u2026 ?\u201d The judge that was organising felt doubtful.\u201cThis kid easily dominated the outer disciples contest and got first. His understanding and potential is immeasurable. I think we can give him a chance.\u201d The white-bearded old man said.Zhao Feng looked gratefully towards him. He had helped him more than once.\u201cI oppose!\u201d A cold voice sounded from opposite corner. The person was Zhao Tianjian.\u201cEvery country has their own rules! How can rules be changed for one person? If they arrive late for the main tournament, then it is obvious that he is disregarding the rules!\u201d Zhao Tianjian said righteously.Zhao Feng felt sick. He was late because Zhao Tianjian had sent assassins after him.Now, Zhao Tianjian was stopping him from entering the tournament.\u201cYou\u2019re right! Zhao Tianjian is correct! We can\u2019t let people like him through the back door.\u201d\u201cHeh, this kid can wait for the next tournament three years later.\u201d Many people looked gloatingly at Zhao Feng.The high ups of the Zhao sect started to discuss among themselves. This year\u2019s contest was very important. Not only some of the elders arrived even the head of the sect \u201cZhao Tiancang\u201d was here. Their point of view was different compared to others. They would rather raise more geniuses than care about rules.\u201cWhat do the two main judges think?\u201d The head of the sect Zhao Tiancang said expressionlessly. There were three people who had the most power in the main tournament: the head of the sect and the two main judges.\u201cI support Zhao Feng. It\u2019s better for the sect if we have more geniuses.\u201d The white-bearded main judge said. Immediately, all the people turned to look at the other main judge. The other judge was a white-robed old man.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng saw that this person was familiar. He then immediately realised that this person was the one guarding the Martial Arts Library last time.The white-robed old man also saw Zhao Feng and said deeply: \u201cI also support Zhao Feng.\u201dThe crowd stirred. Both the main judges had decided to support Zhao Feng!Two of the three people who had the most power here had decided to help Zhao Feng. Even the head of the sect couldn\u2019t do anything about it now.\u201cHow could this happen\u2026 ?\u201d Zhao Tianijan\u2019s face turned green.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

This was the first time Zhao Feng felt a sense of belonging to his sect.Zhao Tianjian was trembling in anger. He couldn\u2019t believe that Zhao Feng could return alive.\u201cGray eagle has failed.\u201d With gray eagle\u2019s strength, how could he possibly fail?\u201cZhao Feng!\u201dThe judge said: \u201cI shall explain the rules to you now.\u201d\u201c\u201dYes.\u201d Zhao Feng listened carefully.People challenged one another in this tournament. The first round 'spot challenge\u201d was when the fifty outer disciples challenged the fifty inner disciples. If they won they took the places of inner disciples. Every outer disciples had three chances to challenge someone, if they lost all three challenges then they would remain outer disciples. Therefore, before the outer disciples challenged anyone, they first had to estimate their own strength and choose the weaker inner disciples.\u201cZhao Feng, since you were late, you only have one chance to challenge someone.\u201d The judge said strictly.One chance?Zhao Feng nodded his head: \u201cI understand.\u201d With his strength, he could easily become an inner disciple. Unless Zhao Feng was retarded and chose someone like Zhao Linlong, he would win. Obviously, Zhao Feng would do that and challenge the strongest guy straight away.\u201cNow you can choose one person. If you win, you can take their spot.\u201d The judge warned.\u201cOk!\u201d Zhao Feng jumped on stage and surveyed the fifty people.Fifty people, fifty seats all arranged in order.The order from left to right went Zhao Linlong, Zhao Chi, Zhao Han, Zhao Qin\u2026.The first row of ten represented the top ten inner disciples. On the seventh chair of the second row, Zhao Feng spotted Zhao Yufei. Zhao Yufei looked at him and gently smiled. The two were neighbours and were quite familiar with each other.Zhao Yue, Zhao Yijian, Zhao Gan, Zhao Guang were between fortieth and fiftieth place. Apart from Zhao Feng, there was only five others that had become inner disciples.Who should I challenge? Zhao Feng smiled as he inspected them. Zhao Linlong, who was in first place had his eyes closed, as if he was trying to gain insights into something. It seemed like the tournament had nothing to do with him.,The top inner disciples didn\u2019t even worry. However, the disciples ranked at the bottom were nervous. After all, Zhao Feng was the top outer disciple. He could easily reach the top ten with his strength.\u201cThe second row\u2026 Sixth seat\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes settled on the person on Zhao Yufei right.\u201cNumber sixteen \u201cZhao Fei\u201d, please come out.\u201d The judge said. Zhao Fei was sixteen or seventeen years old. He had the cultivation of the peak third rank, but his aura wasn\u2019t any weaker than cultivators of the fourth rank.\u201cKid, don\u2019t think that you can beat me just because you\u2019ve reached the fourth rank!\u201d Zhao Fei calmly walked on stage.\u201cHeh, this Zhao Fei is pretty strong. With his [Block Metal Body], he\u2019s beaten two quasi-martial artists.\u201d\u201cZhao Feng might not advance so smoothly.\u201dIn terms of winning, Zhao Feng obviously had a higher chance. But his opponents strength wasn\u2019t weak either, so it would be a tough fight.\u201cMetal Sand Palm!\u201d Zhao Fei only used a middle ranked martial art.Pah!The damage was higher than most high ranked martial arts. This was because it had been trained to the peak level!Zhao Feng was slightly moved. At the outer disciple contest, only he had trained middle ranked martial arts to the high level. The thing was, Zhao Fei\u2019s Metal Sand Palm complemented his Block Metal Body. Therefore, this palm could beat Zhao Yijian\u2019s Ice Flowing Sword.\u201cZhao Fei\u2019s strength is not any weaker than half-step martial artists now.\u201d A few of the inner disciples nodded in approval.Flaming Metal Fist!Zhao Feng casually threw out a punch. He was using core ranked martial arts. Not only that, he didn\u2019t add any Inner Strength to it.This scene caused many people to be shocked. Not using Inner Strength meant that he didn\u2019t have an advantage.\u201cKid, don\u2019t try to be cool!\u201d Zhao Fei took a deep breath and circulated Block Metal Body and Metal Sand Palm to the max.Originally he didn\u2019t think that he\u2019d beat Zhao Feng, he could only spar a bit. But since the opponent was so arrogant\u2026On the stage, the two figures closed in on each other and the fist and palm hit the other.\u201cBreak\u2014\u2013\u201dZhao Fei had a face of urgency and happiness But reality is cruel.Peh!The second his palm hit the fist, he felt overwhelming power numb his arm.Ah!Zhao Fei\u2019s started to sweat. He felt that Zhao Feng was as powerful as a bull.Pong\u2014Zhao Fei didn\u2019t even understand what was happening and he was sent flying. One move. All it took Zhao Feng to beat Zhao Fei was one move. Although it wasn\u2019t surprising that Zhao Feng would win, to win in one move was unpredicted.\u201cHe won by using core ranked martial arts and he didn\u2019t use any Inner Strength.\u201d\u201cZhao Feng has learnt a high ranked body martial art\u2026 \u201d\u2026\u2026\u2026.\u201cZhao Feng, challenge successful! You are ranked sixteenth for now. As for Zhao Fei, you have three chances to challenge someone\u2026 \u201d The judge declared.After beating Zhao Fei, Zhao Feng walked calmly towards the sixth seat of the second row. On his left was Zhao Yufei.\u201cYour Metal Wall Technique has reached at least the third level.\u201d Zhao Yufei said slightly surprised. Zhao Feng had learnt this skill from her grandfather.According to her knowledge, Metal Wall Technique was very hard to train. Her grandfather had said that Zhao Feng would only be able to train it to the second level at max. But from Zhao Feng\u2019s performance, his Metal Wall Technique had reached at least the third level.\u201cYep.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled. His Metal Wall Technique had already reached the peak fourth level. There was a huge difference between the third and fourth level. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t even use half his strength when fighting Zhao Fei.Onstage, the fighting continued. According to the rules, Zhao Fei had another chance to challenge someone. Soon, Zhao Fei successfully beat someone and was ranked twenty-sixthThe tournament was delayed since Zhao Feng had entered halfway through.Because there were fifty spots for inner disciples and there was fifty-one people, one person was eliminated.Zhao Feng and five other outer disciples had become inner disciples.\u201cThe spot challenge has finished\u2026 \u201d The judge let out a breath and started to declare the start of the next round. They were proceeding to the Ranking tournament.According to the news before, the top twenty, ten and three had different rewards.Especially the top three, they could choose peak ranked martial arts.This was where Zhao Feng was especially moved. It was obvious that the competition was going to be very fierce. Also, the inner disciples ranking decided one\u2019s honor and glory. All the youth\u2019s here were eighteen or under, and they had desire to win.\u201cThe second round \u201cRanking tournament\u201d means that all of you have three chances of challenging someone. If you fail then your chances decrease by one\u2026 \u201d The judge said.The rules were very clear.The one\u2019s ranked behind would challenge the one\u2019s ranked higher. If they won they would replace the opponent\u2019s rank. Everyone only had three chances to challenge someone. If they were successful, they still had three chances, but if they failed, their chances decreased by one.\u201cUnderstood.\u201d The fifty people nodded their heads.The one\u2019s ranked last challenged others first. It first started with rank fifty.However, for those at the bottom, they were already very happy in becoming an inner disciple and they knew that they had no chance to get to the top twenty.Therefore, there weren\u2019t many people challenging others between fortieth and fiftieth place.Even if there were, they just wanted to show off and they won higher rankings even if they didn\u2019t get any rewards.Fortieth\u2026 Thirty-ninth\u2026 Thirty-eighth\u2026The rankings edged closer and closer. When it reached twentieth to thirtieth place, the fighting became more and more fierce. People such as Zhao Yue, Zhao Yijian had all reached the top thirty. Zhao Yijian reached twelfth and Zhao Yue had reached fifteenth.Overall, the top twenty inner disciples had the strength of quasi-martial artists. Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei were both true martial artists so no one dared to challenge them. There were less than ten disciples who had reached the fourth rank of the martial path.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter the top twenty was confirmed, they started to compete for the top ten. Soon, it was Zhao Yufei turn to challenge someone. Zhao Feng would challenge someone after Zhao Yufei\u2019s turn.There were many top ten inner disciples that had not reached the fourth rank of the martial path.Zhao Yufei decided to challenge number six and she won her match easily.After reaching the top ten, Zhao Yufei gave up her chance to keep on challenging someone. This way, she could still save her two chances for the next two rounds.\u201cNumber sixteen Zhao Feng, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d At this moment, the judge declared.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Being the top outer disciple, who would he challenge?The top six had all reached the fourth rank. Zhao Linlong had reached the peak of the fifth rank, a bit better than Zhao Feng. Under the expectations of the crowd, Zhao Feng slowly said: \u201cPass.\u201dWhat!? Pass?\u201cGiving up your chance to challenge someone this round means that you only have two chances left to challenge someone.\u201d The judge said, surprised.However, the rules said that the challenger could give up their chance if they wanted to. Zhao Feng obviously had his plans when he passed his turn.His goal was the top three. This was only the first of three rounds, he didn\u2019t need everyone to know his true strength.Secondly, he first wanted to understand the true strength of Zhao Linlong. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t dare to look down on the top three as they had all reached the fifth rank.\u201cHmph! You think that because you gave up your chance, I don\u2019t have anyway around that\u2026 \u201d Zhao Han, who was ranked third, looked mockingly towards Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng also felt his enmity.Before the tournament, Zhao Han had once told him that he would break his arm, just like how Zhao Feng did to Zhao Yijian.After ten days, Zhao Han\u2019s cultivation was fully stable, and he could keep his Inner Strength under control.Number fifteenth\u2026 fourteenth\u2026 thirteenth\u2026The challengers became stronger. The competition for the top ten was very intense, but it was mainly focused on the seventh to tenth places. This was because the other six had all reached the fourth rank or higher, their places were stable.Soon, the top ten was decided. Now, the people focused on the top five and even the top three.\u201cI want to challenge number four, Zhao Qin.\u201d The azure-clothed youth said as he held his halberd. The impression that Zhao Qin gave Zhao Feng was gentle,quiet and calm.\u201cZhao Tun, you just reached the fourth rank not long ago and you\u2019re already challenging me?\u201d Zhao Qin faintly smiled. Her style of fighting was similar to her attitude. She used softness to counter hardness and her speciality was speed.\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I can challenge in the top five. Let\u2019s have a good fight!\u201d Zhao Tun danced with his halberd. This was just the beginning of the ranking tournament and two true martial artists were already fighting. After tangling for a long time, Zhao Qin came out victorious. After all, she had the higher cultivation and her skills were trained to a higher level.Although Zhao Tun lost, his ranking stayed the same. Zhao Qin felt helpless as she scanned the top three. The top three were all too strong. All of them had reached the fifth rank. But to give up so easily wasn\u2019t her style.Zhao Qin finally made her decision: \u201cI choose to challenge number two, Zhao Chi.\u201dZhao Chi had just recently reached the fifth rank as well, but his Inner Strength wasn\u2019t as strong as Zhao Han\u2019s.\u201cHaha! You know you\u2019ll still lose Zhao Qin, so why bother!\u201d Zhao Chi lazily jumped onstage.The two face off. Zhao Feng was finally able to see the strength of the top three now.\u201cBlue Cloud Finger!\u201d Zhao Qin slowly lifted her finger. A faint blue glow came from the finger. It seemed weak and fragile, yet, it still swished through the air. This finger skill of hers was a high ranked martial art. She had trained it to a high level and she understood how to use it very well.\u201cThe damage of her skill is not bad. The energy is focused onto one point. It contains both the softness of water and the hardness of ice.\u201d Zhao Feng analysed as he watched with his left eye.Although Zhao Yijian\u2019s Ice Flowing Sword and Zhao Qin\u2019s Blue Cloud Finger were both high ranked martial arts that had reached the high level, the damage dealt by them was not comparable.\u201cAi\u2026 you\u2019ve only improved by this much!\u201d Zhao Chi\u2019s lazy voice sounded.Shuah!Zhao Chi\u2019s body turned into an afterimage as he dodged Zhao Qin\u2019s attack.Not good!She had still underestimated Zhao Chi\u2019s strength.\u201cZhao Chi\u2019s movement skill has reached the high level.\u201d The disciples exclaimed.\u201cHowling Sky Fist!\u201d Zhao Chi appeared behind Zhao Qin and punched at her.His fist was covered in a bright red glow. When it moved through the air, it caused a sound similar to lightning. Just the fist moving through the air caused the eardrums of some inner disciples to tremble.\u201cWhat a devastating fist skill. This skill\u2019s infinitely close to a peak ranked martial art, it\u2019s no worse than my Metal Wall Technique.\u201d Zhao Feng was slightly surprised.\u201cBlue Clouds Flying!\u201d Zhao Qin shouted as she took the punch straight on. Immediately, she was sent flying and she coughed up blood as she landed on the ground.Just one punch injured Zhao Qin. It was lucky that she used softness to counter hardness, any other cultivator would\u2019ve been instantly defeated.\u201cThat was just warm up.\u201d Zhao Chi said indifferently and attacked again. His performance made all the disciples wary of him!\u201cHigh ranked footwork skill, high ranked inner strength skill, high ranked body skill\u2026 \u201dZhao Chi\u2019s skills were displayed. Although he had learnt many different skills, most of them had reached the high level. Even his body skill had reached the fourth level, meaning that he was able to counter swords and blades with his body alone.\u201cThere\u2019s no obvious flaws. His Howling Sky Fist is deadly.\u201d Zhao Feng thought. He was a tough opponent.No wonder he looked so disdainfully at him at the outer disciples contest. Zhao Feng wouldn\u2019t have been able to last through three moves of his back then.Onstage.Zhao Chi was just toying with Zhao Qin. After exchanging around twenty blows, Zhao Qin was puffing already and so surrendered. Zhao Qin knew that she could only last twenty moves since Zhao Chi was going easy on her. If Zhao Chi tried his best, he could win in under three moves.\u201cNone of you have the right to challenge the top three.\u201d Zhao Chi said as he casually glanced towards Zhao Feng.Hm?Zhao Feng immediately had a feeling that he thoughts were read.How did he know that Zhao Feng was going to challenge the top three?From the situation right now, fourth place Zhao Qin, fifth place Zhao Tun, and sixth place Zhao Yufei didn\u2019t seem to have any intentions to try to challenge the top three.After Zhao Qin\u2019s turn, it was Zhao Han\u2019s turn.\u201cZhao Han! Zhan Han!\u201d Many people cheered on Zhao Han as he was a contender for becoming first.\u2026\u2026The tournament had now reached a climax. Even Zhao Chi had a solemn expression when looking at Zhao Han. Only first place Zhao Linlong had an expressionless face on.Zhao Han\u2019s eyes passed between Zhao Chi and Zhao Linlong. He was ranked third place, and there were only two people in front of him.Zhao Linlong, or Zhao Chi?The disciples were expectant. It would be an intense match if Zhao Han chose Zhao Linlong or Zhao Chi.However, reality was different. After Zhao Han\u2019s eyes passed Zhao Linlong and Zhao Chi, he started to look at the second row instead.Ah!The disciples of the second row trembled in fear. The first row were the top ten disciples. The second row were the eleventh to twentieth disciples.\u201cI want to challenge\u2026 the sixth seat of the second row!\u201d Zhao Han\u2019s cold voice echoed.The sixth seat of the second row.Zhao Han didn\u2019t challenge the top two, not even the top ten, but the top twenty!The sixth seat of the second row? Who was that unlucky bastard?The crowds attention turned towards that spot.Me?Zhao Feng was stunned.Yep, Zhao Han was challenging him!\u201cZhao Han, are you sure you want to do this?\u201d The judge scrunched up his eyebrows: \u201cThe ones that are ranked higher will lose their spots if they lose to a person with lower ranking. And even if you win, there\u2019s no benefit gained.\u201dAccording to the rules, those of higher rank could challenge those of lower ranks. But nobody would do so as there wasn\u2019t any benefits. Instead, one would lose one of their challenging chances.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Han\u2019s murderous eyes locked onto Zhao Feng.Some of the disciples had understanding looks. Many of them knew that Zhao Han was Zhao Yijian\u2019s cousin and their relationship was pretty good. At the twelfth spot, Zhao Yijian immediately looked gratefully at Zhao Han.\u201cZhao Feng? Do you not have the courage to fight me?\u201d Zhao Han mocked.\u201cWhat\u2019s there to fear?\u201d Zhao Feng remained expressionless as he jumped onstage.Although he knew he would have to fight Zhao Han, he didn\u2019t think that it would be this early.\u201cI\u2019ll first break his arm, then I\u2019ll challenge Zhao Linlong.\u201d Zhao Han planned.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cZhao Han\u2019s challenging Zhao Feng?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s obvious, he\u2019s taking revenge for his cousin.\u201d\u201cAlthough Zhao Feng\u2019s strong, he\u2019s still not Zhao Han\u2019s match.\u201dMany disciples were either sympathetic or gloating.Although Zhao Feng was the top outer disciple and he was a true martial artist, there was still a huge gap between him and Zhao Han.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

One of them was the king of the outer disciples, while the other was a top tier inner disciple.The onlookers started to quiet down. Although the final outcome wouldn\u2019t change, this was still an exciting match.Hu~The cold Inner Strength started to flow out from Zhao Han. It caused to whole arena to become colder and colder. Although Zhao Feng was still a few metres away, he felt his limbs begin to freeze. This wasn\u2019t his imagination, the cold actually existed. The source of it came from the element of Zhao Han\u2019s Inner Strength.\u201cWhat strong Inner Strength! With it containing the element of ice, his Inner Strength is stronger than most other peak fifth rankers.\u201d The older generation of the Zhao sect exclaimed.Precisely. Zhao Han\u2019s Inner Strength was very powerful. Using this advantage, he had beat the third strongest inner disciple of the Xin family \u201cXin Tong\u201d in one move. His strength was already imprinted in their hearts.Now that Zhao Han had gained control over his chaotic Inner Strength fully, he was even more fearsome.\u201cZhao Han found a mysterious crystal shard a few months ago, allowing his Inner Strength to develop exponentially.\u201d An old man smiled.\u201cNo wonder his Inner Strength is so strong.\u201dThe Azure Flower Continent was full of mysterious items and places. As it had existed for thousands of years, there were many tombs and queer items that could instantly help lucky cultivators who had the chance to obtain them turn into strong cultivators.Obviously, Zhao Han was a lucky person, as he was able to obtain a mysterious crystal shard.He had rapidly increased his cultivation level over the past six months and had the right to compete for the top inner disciple.\u201cZhao Feng, I\u2019ll let you have three moves.\u201d Zhao Han looked down on Zhao Feng. The coldness from his voice seemed to perfectly complement his cold Inner Strength.Three moves?The crowd didn\u2019t think he was arrogant. Instead, they thought that this was perfectly acceptable.After all, Zhao Han\u2019s rank far exceeded Zhao Feng\u2019s. From giving Zhao Feng three moves, no one would say that he had bullied the weak.\u201cHahaha\u2026 three moves? Zhao Han! Are you such a wimp!? I can give you ten moves.\u201d Zhao Feng laughed aloud and said mockingly towards Zhao Han.Ten moves!The crowd looked at Zhao Feng like he was a monster. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t reject the chance to have three moves only, he had even given Zhao Han ten moves to attack first.The crowd soon became quiet again after a bit of discussion.\u201cHe\u2019s definitely joking.\u201d\u201cObviously.\u201dSome shook their heads.\u201cHe\u2019s going to lose anyways, so giving Zhao Han ten moves doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\u2026\u2026.\u201cTen moves?\u201d Zhao Han\u2019s face paled. Suppressing his anger, he bitterly spat out: \u201cYou\u2019re courting death!\u201dHu~As soon as he finished, his two shoulders emitted an ice cold aura. The forty-eight inner disciples coughed due to the cold.A thin layer of silver white ice appeared on Zhao Han\u2019s palm\u2019s as it flew at Zhao Feng. The power of this palm could easily destroy anyone of the fourth rank or lower.\u201cThe first move\u2026. \u201d Zhao Feng shouted. He didn\u2019t attack. HE started to circulate Air Crossing Breathing Technique and Metal Wall Technique to protect his body instead. The two figures clashed together.Pah!Although Zhao Han\u2019s hand hit Zhao Feng, the latter twisted his body away, and successfully blocked the attack. In that interval, the Inner Strength of the two people clashed.Teng! Teng! Teng\u2026One of the figures was pushed back.What happened!?The disciples were in shock, because the one that was pushed back was Zhao Han! Zhao Han steadied himself after being pushed back. His face was dim with anger.A numbing feel came from his arm and couldn\u2019t help himself but exclaim: \u201cHow does he have so much power?\u201dWhen Zhao Han and Xin Tong sparred ten days ago, Zhao Feng\u2019s body technique was nowhere near close enough to threaten him.However, today, Zhao Feng\u2019s body technique was even stronger than Xin Tong\u2019s.\u201cHehe, you\u2019re not the only one that improved.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled as he released his Inner Strength.His Inner Strength had broken through the fourth rank and reached the fifth rank. The main point was that Zhao Feng\u2019s Inner Strength was under complete control, unlike Zhao Han\u2019s, whose Inner Strength suppressed others in quantity rather than quality.\u201cThe Inner Strength of the fifth rank!\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation was only at the peak of the fourth rank, but his Inner Strength had already reached the fifth rank.\u201cHis body strengthening technique is extremely powerful. It far exceeds the ones that the sect\u2019s disciples use.\u201d The white-bearded judge smiled. His decision to support Zhao Feng was correct.\u201cHe still has remaining aura\u2019s of cultivation resources. It looks like he\u2019s been quite lucky.\u201d The head of the sect Zhao Tiancang said as he looked towards Zhao Feng.\u201cDon\u2019t be too full of yourself, I only used fifty-percent of my strength just then.\u201d Zhao Han turned his embarrassment into anger.\u201cCold Snow Palm!\u201d Zhao Han lept up and slowly pushed out his palm.The palm seemed slow, yet, it condensed his Inner Strength to a very dense point. Before the attack had arrived, the coldness would already freeze the opponent\u2019s blood.\u201cThe second move!\u201d Zhao Feng stayed where he stood and once again, circulated Metal Wall Technique and Air Crossing Breathing Technique to block Zhao Han\u2019s attack.Boom!There was a loud boom as the figures intercepted each other. A shock wave swept everything up in a five metre radius.Zhao Han retreated back once again. His arm was almost fully numb again.After fending off Zhao Han, Zhao Feng felt a cold Inner Strength flow into his body. But after the Metal Wall Technique reached the fourth level, his body was not only as strong as metal, it also increased the resistance he had against Inner Strength. Not only that, Zhao Feng\u2019s real cultivation was actually at the fifth rank.\u201cThis is not possible!\u201d Zhao Han\u2019s face turned cruel and leapt furiously towards Zhao Feng.However, Zhao Feng was like a metal wall, not moving at all. No matter how furiously he attacked, Zhao Feng time after time fended him off.\u201cHis defense is probably the best out of the inner disciples.\u201dThe Zhao sect disciples were in a daze.The second move\u2026 The third move\u2026 The fourth move\u2026Every time Zhao Feng blocked a move, he would tell Zhao Han how many moves he had used.Zhao Feng only defended since the start of the match.\u201cOh my god! Is he really going to let Zhao Han have ten moves?\u201d\u201cLooks like it. It\u2019s already been five moves and he hasn\u2019t attacked yet.\u201dWhispers went through the crowd. On the stage, the number twelve ranked Zhao Yijian was pale-faced: \u201cWhy is it like this\u2026? When did he get so strong? Why isn\u2019t it me!!!\u201d\u201cNot only did he not die, he became even stronger\u2026 \u201d Zhao Tianjian\u2019s face was green.He had payed someone to assassinate Zhao Feng. Not only did they fail, they allowed Zhao Feng\u2019s strength to increase even more.\u201cHis defense is at the metal wall level. Even Inner Strength is weakened against it. This means his Metal Wall Technique is at least at the fourth level.\u201d Zhao Yufei face was full of shock. She couldn\u2019t believe her eyes. Zhao Feng\u2019s Metal Wall Technique was given by her. She clearly knew how hard it was to train this skill.The fifth move\u2026. The sixth move\u2026. The seventh move\u2026..Zhao Han\u2019s attacks became more and more insane. At the end, his lips started to leak blood from how hard he was biting them.However, every time he attacked, Zhao Feng was never harmed. Instead, the recoil injured himself.\u201cThe ninth move\u2026 the tenth move\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s voice suddenly became loud: \u201cZhao Han! The ten moves have finished! You\u2019re strength disappoints me.\u201dHis voice was like a nightmare.The ten moves had finished!Zhao Feng stated the truth. If I let you have ten moves, then you\u2019ll have ten moves.This scene caused the disciples and elders to be extremely disturbed. Now, after the ten moves had finished, Zhao Feng would not defend anymore.\u201cAngry Dragon Fists!A green color appeared on Zhao Feng\u2019s palm. The Angry Dragon Fists he was using now almost surpassed the original Angry Dragon Fists!Pah\u2014-The floating casual fist just happened to hit the flaw on Zhao Han\u2019s body.Wah!Zhao Han spat out a mouthful of blood as he was knocked backwards. At this moment, he had lost all sanity and he fought even more crazily.But the more he turned insane, the more flaws appeared. In Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes, his opponent was just a child brandishing a stick. When Zhao Han was calm, Zhao Feng thought that he was on par with Zhao Chi, the number two inner disciples. But with him going crazy, he was now no threat at all.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, lose\u2026 \u201dAfter being beaten one move after another, Zhao Han was now only using pure power, there was no skill involved. Soon, Zhao Feng dodged one of Zhao Han\u2019s attacks and in the gap interval, Zhao Feng landed a kick on Zhao Han\u2019s abdomen.Peng!Zhao Han flew back tens of metres and landed face first.I don\u2019t believe it!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Han tried to get back up.\u201cJudge, why aren\u2019t you saying that he lost yet?\u201d Zhao Feng asked.\u201cAh!\u201d The judge finally recovered from his shock and quickly shouted: \u201cZhao Han, challenge failed! The challenged will now take the third spot.\u201dThird?Zhao Feng\u2019s lips curled into a smile. His goal to reach the top three inner disciples was now achieved.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The result was unexpected. Being a black horse, Zhao Feng continued to dominate his opponents and create miracles.Now he had beaten the third strongest inner disciple, Zhao Han. Zhao Feng laughed as he sat down on the third seat of the first row.On his right side was Zhao Chi, who was looking at him as if it was the first time he saw him. When the outer disciples contest had ended, Zhao Chi went over to inspect Zhao Feng, but at that time, Zhao Feng was utter trash compared to him.After Zhao Chi beat Zhao Qin, he casually said that no one had the right to fight for the top three spots. However, right now, Zhao Feng was sitting next to him.The top three were: Zhao Linlong, Zhao Chi, Zhao Feng.Next it was Zhao Chi\u2019s turn to challenge someone. Zhao Chi lazily stretched his back and landed on the stage.\u201cNumber two Zhao Chi, who do you challenge?\u201d The judge smiled.Being number two, who else could he challenge? Instantly, everyone\u2019s eyes turned towards Zhao Linlong.Now that Zhao Chi had gone onstage, there was no one blocking his vision from looking at Zhao Linlong. Zhao Linlong wore a golden robe. He had thick black eyebrows, and an aura as deep as the sea.Since the beginning of the tournament Zhao Linlong had his eyes closed. Even when Zhao Feng defeated Zhao Han, he had remained expressionless, as if nothing mattered to him.\u201cZhao Linlong, give me some face. Come onstage.\u201d Zhao Chi said mockingly.\u201cNumber one, Zhao Linlong.\u201d The judge warned.\u201cHmm.\u201d Zhao Linlong slowly rose.The moment he stood up, he turned into a golden blur. Instantly, he landed onstage.\u201cHow are there so many Zhao Linlong\u2019s?\u201d\u201cAfterimage! So fast!\u201dThe crowd exclaimed. Many spectators couldn\u2019t even see how Zhao Linlong moved.\u201cWhat kind of footwork skill is that? It\u2019s so complex.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s eyebrows scrunched together.Although he could see how Zhao Linlong moved with his left eye, he couldn\u2019t see any flaws.\u201cZhao Linlong, we haven\u2019t met for half a year. It looks like your Step Shadow skill has reached the peak level. No wonder you\u2019re one of the fourth geniuses of Sun Feather City.\u201d Zhao Chi was slightly moved.Step Shadow was a high ranked martial art. It\u2019s fame exceeded most other high ranked martial arts due to its superiority.Peak level of a high ranked martial art!The disciples could only watch in awe. There was no second genius of the Zhao sect who could train a high ranked martial art to the peak level.\u201cZhao Chi, you\u2019re the only one who can give me a fight. Today, I will suppress my cultivation to the fourth rank and spar with you.\u201d Zhao Linlong said casually.Immediately, the other disciples expressions turned dark. There was no one apart from Zhao Chi who had the right to challenge him? Zhao Linlong\u2019s words caused many to be unhappy.How would the number three, number four, and number five feel?Zhao Feng\u2019s eyebrows scrunched up then immediately resumed normal. Ever since he saw the shy girl attack the poweful Hyena in the Sky Cloud Forest, Zhao Feng understood something: \u201cThere was always someone stronger than you.\u201dHe strained towards the outside. He wanted to explore the outside world.\u201cHateful! That Zhao Linlong\u2026 \u201dSitting on the sixth seat of the second row, Zhao Han\u2019s face was full of unwillingness.Just a while ago, his cultivation had increased by leaps and bounds. His Inner Strength had reached the peak of the fifth rank, approaching the sixth rank.This made him arrogant and a contender for the top inner disciple. In terms of favouritism, he had surpassed Zhao Chi.However, Zhao Linlong\u2019s words hit him into hell. And because he had just lost to Zhao Feng, he had no right to speak out against him.At this time, the battle began.\u201cSky Howling Fist!\u201dZhao Chi\u2019s fist started to glow red. Zhao Chi\u2019s Sky Howling Fist was very similar to Zhao Feng\u2019s Angry Dragon Fist, but the ranks of the martial arts were one tier apart.With Zhao Chi fully utilising Sky Howling Fist, his strength crept towards the peak of the fifth rank. Adding on his footwork, body strengthening skills and techniques, his damage scale was frightening.\u201cIn terms of overall strength, Zhao Chi is indeed harder to fight compared to Zhao Han. He almost has zero flaws, and his offense is also powerful.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head.Zhao Han suppressed his opponents by overpowering them with Inner Strength, but his speed and defense weren\u2019t strong.\u201cReceive my punch!\u201d Zhao Chi shouted onstage as his fist swept towards Zhao Linlong.Shuah!A broken afterimage was left behind. The next moment, Zhao Linlong appeared smiling faintly next to Zhao Chi.Zhao Chi\u2019s fist didn\u2019t even touch his robe.What was even more frightening was that Zhao Linlong was only half a metre away from him. Zhao Chi broke out in cold sweat.At this instant, he could even smell Zhao Linlong.\u201cSmoking Rain Step!\u201dZhao Chi after all wasn\u2019t useless. Immediately, he used a high ranked footwork skill and started to exchange blows with Zhao Linlong.Immediately, the two figures interwieved. Both of them used high ranked martial arts.The reason why Zhao Linlong said that Zhao Chi was the only one who could fight him was because Zhao Chi had learnt a lot of high ranked martial arts.High ranked fist skill! High ranked footwork skill! High ranked body strengthening technique\u2026 All of these skills had been trained to a high level.Zhao Chi continuously attacked with these skills. Now his momentum had surpassed Zhao Linlong. Although his momentum had surpassed Zhao Linlong, Zhao Chi was still pushed back. After exchanging twenty blows, Zhao Linlong had steadily overpowered him with the cultivation of the fourth rank only.\u201cI\u2019ll make you lose willingly!\u201d Zhao Linlong smiled faintly.He raised his finger and a purple azure aura spun around in circles.Shua!Just the thread of Inner Strength sent out a frightening aura.\u201cSpatial Cloud Finger!\u201dThat finger seemed to open a hole in the clouds. That is\u2026Zhao Chi took a deep breath as he gathered all his Inner Strength to counter the finger.\u201cSky Howling Leaping Thunder!\u201d Zhao Chi\u2019s fist glowed fire red as it faced the finger.The power of this fist exceeded any skill that had been used so far in the tournament. But, although his fist seemed powerful, it seemed like it was an ant compared to the casual finger of Zhao Linlongs.Hooong\u2014-The two moves finally clashed. Zhao Chi immediately tasted a copper liquid inside his mouth as he was knocked backwards.\u201cNot bad, you\u2019re able to block my \u2018peak ranked\u2019 martial art.\u201d A golden-robed youth appeared with his hands behind his back.\u201cPeak ranked martial art? I didn\u2019t lose injustly.\u201d Zhao Chi said bitterly as he surrendered.Spatial Cloud Finger!Peak ranked martial art!The crowd was in shock.When did Zhao Linlong learn a peak ranked martial art?\u201cHehe, Zhao Linlong has already learnt the first three moves of the Spatial Cloud Finger. That was just the first one.\u201d The head of the sect Zhao TIancang said proudly.\u201cCongratulations for taking in such a good step-son.\u201d The elders came over and congratulated the head of the sect.Zhao Linlong was the head of the sects step-son! No wonder he could learn peak ranked martial arts. But the thing was that peak ranked martial arts usually needed one to reach the seventh rank of the martial path to understand it. Those that could learn peak ranked skills were usually Martial Masters!\u2026.\u201cZhaoChi! Challenge failed, rank not changed. Zhao Linlong, rank not changed.\u201d The judge announced.Zhao Linlong and Zhao Chi returned to their seats. Returning to his seat, Zhao Linlong was expressionless and didn\u2019t challenge anyone. In his opinion, there was no one left to challenge.The first round of the challenging contest ended. Next was the second round of the challenging contest. There was a total of three chances to challenge someone per person.There were barely any challengers in the second round. But when it was number sixteen, Zhao Han\u2019s turn, he immediately challenged number four Zhao Qin and won.He continued by challenging number two Zhao Chi and number one Zhao Linlong. The result was that he managed to tie with Zhao Chi by using his Inner Strength.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBut when he met Zhao Linlong, Zhao Han was defeated in three moves. He wasn\u2019t like Zhao Chi, who had absolute defense, so he couldn\u2019t even fend off three of Zhao Linlong\u2019s moves.First place Zhao Linlong\u2026 Second place Zhao Chi\u2026 Third place Zhao Feng\u2026 Fourth place Zhao Han.They were the top four inner disciples. No one dared to challenge them.Out of the four, Zhao Linlong led in front by beating Zhao Chi and Zhao Han. Only Zhao Feng had not crossed hands with Zhao Linlong.\u201cThird place Zhao Feng, it\u2019s your turn to challenge someone.\u201d The judge said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was only Zhao Chi and Zhao Linlong in front of him.Although he could beat Zhao Chi, he would have to spend a bit of energy. If he challenged Zhao Linlong, everyone would know his real strength and cultivation. His cultivation had increased way too fast in the past few months and it would attract too much attention.Zhao Feng also wanted to leave a hand to guard against Zhao Tianjian.Furthermore, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t have much confidence in beating Zhao Linlong.\u201cI pass.\u201d Zhao Feng wanted to pass even after he analysed the benefits.His goal was to reach the top three and get a peak ranked martial art. Now that his goal was achieved, there was no point in fighting to the death for a higher rank.Zhao Feng\u2019s pass caused many to be slightly stunned, but they didn\u2019t feel too weird about it. After all, with Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation, to be ranked in the top three was a massive feat already.\u201cI also pass.\u201d Zhao Chi looked deeply at Zhao Feng.He had seen the battle between Zhao Han and Zhao Feng and he knew that Zhao Feng was stronger than him.The top three had all passed.The ranks were: Number one Zhao Linlong, number two Zhao Chi, number three Zhao Feng, number four Zhao Han, number five Zhao Qin, number six Zhao Yufei, number seven Zhao Bing\u2026The top seven were all martial artists.\u201cThis is the last time anyone will have the chance to challenge someone.\u201d The judge announced.After the second round, not many people challenged others as the ranks were almost confirmed. However, when it was number six\u2019s Zhao Yufei turn, there was a small twist.\u201cI want to challenge number five Zhao Qin.\u201d Zhao Yufei\u2019s eyes were like crystal as she smiled faintly.Her challenge caused many to be surprised.\u201cSure.\u201d Zhao Qin nodded her head as she went onstage.Soon, the two beautiful girls faced off. Both Zhao Yufei and Zhao Qin were pretty. Furthermore, they were both talented.As the two headed up, many youths\u2019 heartbeat started to thump faster. It could be said that the two were the women of their dreams.Especially Zhao Yufei. Her age was lower and her prettiness shone.Yi!Zhao Linlong\u2019s eyes flashed brightly as he saw Zhao Yufei.\u201cAzure Cloud Finger!\u201d\u201cButterfly Leaves Palm!\u201dThe two girls shouted as their perfect bodies swayed in the wind.Zhao Qin was always the top girl genius. Her cultivation had almost reached the peak of the fifth rank. In terms of age, Zhao Yufei age was lower than Zhao Qin\u2019s by two years and she had only just reached the fourth rank.However, as they exchanged blows Zhao Yufei wasn\u2019t losing. Zhao Yufei\u2019s Inner Strength was like the wind, agile and fast. Zhao Feng understood that Zhao Yufei was also learning the Air Crossing Breathing Technique, but there was still a big distance between them. But the complexity of Air Crossing Breathing Technique made up for the cultivation gap between the two of them.After exchanging twenty blows, Zhao Qin\u2019s face started to turn solemn as she started to fully circulate her Inner Strength. However, Zhao Yufei still easily dodged her attacks with her agility.Thirty moves! Forty moves!\u2026Zhao Yufei\u2019s skill started to perfect itself as time went on. Only till the eightieth move did a change happen.\u201cButterfly Flower Dance!\u201d Zhao Yufei\u2019s power and speed suddenly stepped into a whole new level.Pah! Pah! Pah\u2026Zhao Yufei\u2019s graceful body was like a butterfly that danced in the air.Zhao Qin was pushed back only after three moves: \u201cYou hid your strength!\u201dZhao Yufei conserved her strength when they exchanged blows before.\u201cI give up.\u201d Zhao Qin was soon injured after a few moves.The disciples started to see Zhao Yufei in a new light. This woman was not only beautiful. Her talent was also top tier.\u201cGood!\u201d Zhao Linlong nodded his head praisingly as he stared at Zhao Yufei.Zhao Chi on his right thought: \u201cCould Zhao Linlong be in\u2026 \u201dBeing number one, Zhao Linlong\u2019s short gaffe was seenby the crowd.\u201cHaha, it looks like the hero can\u2019t pass the beautiful woman.\u201d The elders of the sect laughed.\u201cZhao Yufei\u2019s talent is not weaker than Zhao Linlong. The two would make a good couple.\u201d The head of the sect Zhao Tiancang smiled.\u2026\u2026.After beating Zhao Qin, Zhao Yufei was promoted to fifth. According to the rules, she could keep on challenging others.But as Zhao Yufei looked at the top four, she realised that all of them far exceeded her. When she met Zhao Linlong\u2019s hot eyes, she felt a bit weird.Zhao Linlong was cold and expressionless during the tournament. But when he noticed Zhao Yufei, his coldness seemed to melt. This was the first time it had happened \u2013 Yep, the feeling of his heart thumping.After Zhao Yufei, it was Zhao Han\u2019s. Zhao Han\u2019s eyes passed over Zhao Feng, Zhao Chi and Zhao Linlong. Zhao Han didn\u2019t have any chance to reach top three.Zhao Feng? He had already tasted the bitter side. His strength was terrifying, maybe only Zhao Linlong could stop him.\u201cI pass.\u201d Zhao Han said helplessly.If he hadn\u2019t challenged Zhao Feng before, he could still be ranked in the top three, and with him in peak condition, there was a chance of him beating Zhao Chi.\u201cPass.\u201d Zhao Feng said.\u201cI also pass.\u201d Zhao Chi also said.\u201cThe tournament has ended.\u201d Zhao Linlong faintly smiled and once again looked towards Zhao Yufei.He didn\u2019t know why, but every time he saw her, he felt that she was even more perfect.Feeling his fire-red eyes staring at her, Zhao Yufei on instinct tried to dodge.\u201cThis year\u2019s family sparring contest has come to an end. Now, we will announce the prizes and ranks\u2026 \u201dSoon, the inner disciples ranking came out:First: Zhao LinlongSecond: Zhao ChiThird: Zhao FengFourth: Zhao HanFifth: Zhao YufeiSixth: Zhao QinSeventh: Zhao Bing\u2026\u2026The top disciples were full of expectations. According to last year\u2019s ranking, the top twenty, top ten, and top three would gain extra rewards.\u201cNow the head of the sect will announce the rewards.\u201d The judge said.Head of the sect!A thunderous sound of clapping came from the crowd. Onstage, a middle aged man slowly stood up. He raised his hands and an overbearing pressure came from him.He was the head of the sect, Zhao Tiancang!Zhao Feng felt that the head of the sect\u2019s aura was similar to the high tier deadly beasts in the Sky Cloud Forest. He was a martial master of the seventh rank or higher.Zhao Tiancang scanned the faces of the fifty inner disciples. When it landed on Zhao Linlong, it was extremely caring and loving.Many knew that Zhao Linlong was his step-son.\u201cAll those that have become inner disciples can go to the second level of the Martial Arts Library and choose a high ranked martial art. They\u2019ll also receive a three hundred year blood plant.\u201d The rewards were as good as the rumours said.\u201cThe top twenty can also choose two high ranked martial arts and receive two three-hundred year blood plants. The top ten can also choose two high ranked martial arts and receive one five-hundred year blood plant.\u201d The head of the sect paused.\u201cThe top three can also choose one peak and two high ranked martial art. Also they\u2019ll receive a\u2019blood pill.\u2019\u201d The head of the sect said as he smiled.Peak ranked martial art! Blood pill!The rewards of the top three far exceeded the others. Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but smile.He was in need of peak ranked martial arts. And the blood pill could increase the cultivation of a martial artist.The fifty disciples went to retrieve their rewards under the guidance of the manager. That day, Zhao Feng received a blood pill.As for the one peak ranked and two high ranked martial arts, Zhao Feng had a special token which allowed him to go Martial Arts Library and choose his skills.\u201cI heard that the number one person usually had some special rewards. Why isn\u2019t there any this year?\u201d\u201cMaybe they just haven\u2019t announced it yet.\u201dOn the way back Zhao Feng heard a few discussions. He didn\u2019t bother listening to them. Instead, he just walked back home.\u201cBrother Feng!\u201d A sweet voice called from behind.Without turning his head, Zhao Feng knew that it was Zhao Yufei.The two were neighbours and so they were a bit familiar with one another. After the exchange of Metal Wall Technique and Air Crossing Breathing Technique, the two became even closer.\u201cYufei, your performance was pretty good.\u201d Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but think about her beating Zhao Qin.\u201cI\u2019m still far away from brother Feng. I\u2019m just curious as to why you didn\u2019t challenge Zhao Linlong!\u201d Zhao Yufei looked curiously athim.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShe was certain that his Metal Wall Technique had reached the fourth level. His defense was easily top amongst the inner disciples. Adding on Zhao Feng\u2019s Inner Strength and Lightly Floating Ferry, he had the right to challenge Zhao Linlong.\u201cYou overestimate me. There\u2019s still a big distance between me and Zhao Linlong.\u201d Zhao Feng said humbly.Obviously, Zhao Yufei\u2019s estimation of his strength was the closest. The two\u2019s age\u2019s were close so they got along well.On the corner of the stage. A youth clothed in gold watched Zhao Yufei\u2019s and Zhao Feng\u2019s figure dimly as they walked off together.His eyes flashed coldly and he said to himself: \u201cThat kid seems to be called Zhao Feng?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Yufei\u2019s started to blush. Her eyes secretly glanced towards Zhao Feng but found the latter was calm as if nothing had happened. This caused her to be slightly disappointed.She only felt that Zhao Feng was the only one who could suppress her in the sect, this made her feel somewhat helpless.Returning home, Zhao Feng went to report his gains in the Sky Cloud Forest. Obviously, he didn\u2019t say that Zhao Tianjian had sent someone to kill him, or how he had met high tier deadly beasts. Zhao Yufei still broke out in cold sweat.Going to his room, Zhao Feng let out a long breath: \u201cZhao Tianjian has already sent someone to kill me so he\u2019ll be likely to keep on doing that. Therefore, I\u2019ll hide my cultivation and surprise him.\u201dThe reason why he didn\u2019t challenge Zhao Linlong was because of this. Zhao Feng sat cross-legged on the floor and he put his consciousness into the dimension inside his left eye. In the pitch black area, the faint green glow in the middle had reached five feet nine, which meant that his cultivation had touched the doorway of the peak fifth rank.Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t thinking about this.Appear!Zhao Feng concentrated on his left eye.Shua!Immediately the green glow was replaced by a scene. In the scene there was two figures; one was the high tier Azure Eyed Hyena, while the other was the shy girl who wasn\u2019t much older than Zhao Yufei.Next, the Azure Eyed Hyena and the girl both leapt at each other. The girl in green seemed to meld into the air. Her body gave off a queer azure light, which was much more brighter than Inner Strength. She casually waved her wands and the azure light formed into wind blades that instantly ripped the Azure Eyed Hyena\u2019s head into pieces.\u201cI wonder where that girl is from. Probably no one would be able block one of her moves in Sun Feather City.\u201d Zhao Feng took a cold breath.The scene was replayed again and again. Zhao Feng looked from different angles and positions to see how the girl attacked. Slowly, he began to gain some insight.The casual swipe of her hands contained understanding which far surpassed the martial artists level. Zhao Feng already gained a small bit from just looking at her attacking. At this moment, he had duplicated the move, but the damage was very far off. But the duplication itself already reached a high ranked martial art.This really shocked him. Wouldn\u2019t that mean if he fully duplicated the girl\u2019s moves, it would surpass peak ranked martial arts?Thinking up to here, Zhao Feng became more and more excited.\u201cWhy don\u2019t I name this skill \u2018Mysterious Wind Palm\u2019.\u201dThat night Zhao Feng tried to gain more insight into that move. Since this move was super high tier, Zhao Feng was not able to fully understand it in a short period of time. Only till deep night did Zhao Feng feel tired. It looked like the left eye\u2019s dimension couldn\u2019t continuously help him replay the scene back and forth.\u201cIt takes a lot of my mental energy trying to gain insights from this move.\u201d Zhao Feng concluded.Therefore, he started to train Air Crossing Breathing Technique again.He had received a blood pill from the tournament and it could increase his cultivation. Pills were different from pure plants, they contained a lot less poison within them, so cultivators were able to absorb more and of better quality from it.\u201cI still have three plants over a thousand years old whose values exceed the blood pill.\u201d Zhao Feng thought for a while then decided to eat the pill.Soon the medicine\u2019s power started to flow from within him. The energy was very harmonious with his body. Zhao Feng immediately started to circulate Air Crossing Breathing Technique to absorb the energy.The morning of the second day.Zhao Feng had fully absorbed all the energy and felt his cultivation inch forward a little bit. The green glow inside his left eye had extended just past five-feet-nine.\u201cPeak fifth rank! The pill is indeed helpful.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head in satisfaction.Only Zhao Linlong was on par with him in terms of cultivation. There was still some time, so Zhao Feng began to practice his Mysterious Wind Palm again.Hu~His body lept into the sky and his Inner Strength spun in the heart of his palm.Shua!A branch as thick as an arm was instantly shattered into pieces. Zhao Feng\u2019s palm wasn\u2019t very powerful, yet it contained the power of spinning and slicing.\u201cThis move has reached the high level of a high ranked martial art.\u201d Zhao Feng exclaimed happily.Just when Zhao Feng was fully trying to gain insights on Mysterious Wind Palm\u2026\u201cBrother Feng can I come in?\u201d A familiar girl\u2019s voice sounded.Hm?Zhao Feng\u2019s eyebrows scrunched up.Outside the garden, there was a girl clothed in snow white. She was biting her lips and she didn\u2019t dare to look Zhao Feng in the eye. The person was undoubtedly Zhao Xue.\u201cCome in.\u201d Zhao Feng regained his composure and let her in.The two looked at each other. Zhao Xue seemed to dodge his eyes.\u201cWhat have you come here for?\u201d Zhao Feng said expressionlessly.He had a favorable impression of her since they were childhood friends. But ever since they entered the Zhao sect, the last bit of that favorable impression disappeared.Zhoa Xue\u2019s eyes turned red as she bit her lips: \u201cI\u2019ve been muddled ever since I entered the Zhao sect. I hope that Brother Feng can remember our past days and not hate me\u2026. \u201dLooking at Zhao Xue\u2019s sad face, Zhao Feng\u2019s heart started to ripple, but soon, it became as still as water again.\u201cEveryone has their own freedom to make their choices\u2026 I\u2019ve never hated you.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled faintly as if he was making a casual statement.Sure, Zhao Feng had never hated Zhao Xue, but her actions had disappointed him.I\u2019ve never hated you!Zhao Xue\u2019s heart shook as she looked at the handsome youth: \u201cHas brother Feng never loved me\u2026 even back at Green Leaf Village?\u201d Zhao Feng was a bit doubtful after she said this.Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t even fourteen years old. Half a year ago, he was only thirteen. His heart was pure and it didn\u2019t react to Zhao Xue\u2019s love.Now, Zhao Feng was fourteen and he strained towards the martial path, so he was a bit late on understanding the relationship between boys and girls.Looking at Zhao Feng\u2019s reaction, Zhao Xue\u2019s heart became cold. She finally knew that Zhao Feng had never loved her, at most, it was a favorable impression during their childhood.\u201cBrother Feng!\u201d Outside the garden came another clear voice.Zhao Yufei walked happily into Zhao Feng\u2019s garden. The two were neighbours and they were quite familiar with each other, therefore Zhao Yufei came in without knocking. Soon, she felt that the atmosphere was a bit different.Zhao Feng and Zhao Xue both stood quietly and the latter was crying softly.\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d Zhao Feng turned curiously towards Zhao Yufei.At this moment two beautiful girls stood in this small garden. Zhao Xue\u2019s skin was as smooth as water and her face was extremely pretty. However, compared to Zhao Yufei\u2019s angelic aura, she seemed extremely dim\u2026In terms of talent, aura and body, Zhao Xue was inferior to Zhao Yufei.\u201cBrother Feng, haven\u2019t you been to the Martial Arts Library to get your skills? You can get a peak ranked martial art since you ranked top three.\u201d Zhao Yufei said slightly stunned.She had just gone to the Martial Arts Library to choose her skills. The top ten could choose two high ranked martial arts. The top three could choose one peak ranked and two high ranked martial arts.\u201cHaha, I almost forgot.\u201d Zhao Feng gently smiled.Looking at Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei smiling together, Zhao Xue felt sad and regretful.She regretted her decision in choosing Zhao Yijian\u2026Soon, Zhao Feng arrived at the Martial Arts Library. The elder guarding the library was a white bearded old man that looked familiar.\u201cIt\u2019s you?\u201d The old man\u2019s eyes lit up.Zhao Feng immediately recognised him as well: \u201cThis junior sees elder.\u201dThis old man was one of the two main judges who had supported Zhao Feng.\u201cI\u2019m called Zhao Yusong. You can call me elder Zhao.\u201d The judge said gently.\u201cYes, elder Zhao.\u201d\u201cCome with me.\u201d Zhao Yusong took Zhao Feng to the second level.There were around two to three hundred martial arts in the second level. Most were high ranked, while a low number of them were peak ranked. Peak ranked martial arts were very precious to the Zhao sect.Zhao Feng scanned around and was surprised: \u201cZhao elder, why is there only a token instead of the martial art?\u201dThe second level of the Martial Arts Library didn\u2019t hold martial arts. Instead, there was a jade token which had the skills name and short summaries.\u201cHehe, martial arts of the high rank or higher are very precious. We can\u2019t put the real copy here. When you choose the skill, I\u2019ll go get the book for you.\u201d Zhao Yusong explained.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng was disappointed. The sect was strict with high ranked martial arts which meant he couldn\u2019t \u2018steal\u2019 any. But being able to choose one peak and two high ranked martial arts was still acceptable. He went around the second level and read all the summaries.\u201cWhat, haven\u2019t you found a skill you want yet?\u201d Zhao Yusong asked curiously.Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes twirled and laughed: \u201c Elder Zhao\u2026 since you\u2019re the elder guarding the Martial Arts Library, why don\u2019t you recommend some of the best skills for me.\u201d\u201cHahaha, don\u2019t you know that this goes against the sect\u2019s rules?\u201d Zhao Yusong\u2019s eyes twinkled.Although he said that, Zhao Yusong still helped. He walked into the second level and slowly took a few jade tokens out\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 43": "Chapter 43Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 43 \u2013 Star FingerSeeing the elder\u2019s movement, Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes shone. The second floor of the Martial Arts Library was different from the first floor.There was no real copies of the skills here, instead, they were replaced by jade tokens. There weren\u2019t that many words on the jade tokens that summarised the martial art\u2019s ability and they weren\u2019t very specific. This meant that it was harder to differ which skills were strong or weak.Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t steal one hundred skills like last time and then slowly go over them.Being the one guarding the Martial Arts Library, Elder Zhao obviously knew all of the skills well. What was more important was that Elder Zhao had seen his battles and understood what he was lacking .\u201cThere\u2019s three peak ranked martial arts here which are comparable with you. They are: [Mesmerising Wind Fist], [Star Finger] and [Sky Striking Leg].\u201d Elder Zhao took three jade tokens out.All of them were offensive skills?Zhao Feng was slightly curious as he heard the names.\u201cYour offensive skills are too low ranked, so their potential are limited. But you\u2019ve trained Metal Wall Technique as a defensive skill, which is not far away from a peak ranked martial art. If you ever find the Holy Rank [Silver Wall Technique], it\u2019d be perfect.\u201d The elder explained.No wonder he\u2019s a Martial Master!Zhao Feng approved of what the elder said. His defense was already fine, so all he needed was offensive skills.\u201cThese three peak ranked skills are all different: Mesmerising Wind Fist has the attributes of wind and it uses skill to break through power. When used with a high tier movement skill, the damage would double; Star Finger condenses one\u2019s Inner Strength into one point and it can attack everything within a certain range; Sky Striking Leg can create whirlwinds, attacking a large amount of people and it is very effective against human wave tactics\u2026 \u201c Elder Zhao simply explained the three skills.Zhao Feng felt moved by all three skills.He could exert a lot of power from training in any of these three skills.\u201cWhich of these three is the most powerful?\u201d Zhao Feng directly asked.Although they were all peak ranked, there were still differences between them.\u201cHehe, out of these three skills, the Star Finger is the strongest, approaching even Holy Martial Arts. It\u2019s even better than Zhao Linlong\u2019s Spatial Cloud Finger, but the only problem is that it\u2019s very hard to learn this skill and there\u2019s a certain amount of danger involved. Elder Zhao smiled.\u201cThen I\u2019ll choose that.\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t hesitate at all.He had seen Zhao Linlong\u2019s Spatial Cloud Finger and it was indeed powerful. And this Star Finger skill was even stronger than the Spatial Cloud Finger. After confirming that he wanted to choose the skill, Elder Zhao went and retrieved the copy of Star Finger.Zhao Feng was slightly excited as he received the old book. Soon, the contents of Star Finger went into Zhao Feng\u2019s mind. Star Finger was broken into six grades and the minimum requirement was the Fourth rank of the Martial Path. This finger skill condensed one\u2019s Inner Strength to the maximum. When it reached the low level, it could shoot straight through a two inch thick metal block.Some body strengthening technique would even be useless facing this skill. Furthermore, this skill only cared about power, nothing else.\u201cHahaha, this is just what I wanted.\u201d Zhao Feng was extremely pleased.\u201cStar Finger had a huge advantage and even if you haven\u2019t reached the Seventh rank, but have reached the fourth grade, you can attack through the air.\u201d Elder Zhao couldn\u2019t stop praising this skill.Attack through the air?Zhao Feng\u2019s heart rippled. Everyone knew that only when a cultivator reached the seventh rank, their Inner Strength can leave the body and attack through the air.This meant that they didn\u2019t need to fight close combat, instead they could attack through the air. This was the difference between the sixth and seventh rank. And the peak ranked skill Star Finger could attack through the air before one even reached the seventh rank.\u201cThis finger skill is two to three times harder to train. Some people have considered it to be a half Holy Rank Skill. I also trained this once but I was stuck on the third grade for a long time and because it was just too hard to reach the fourth grade, I gave up and started to train another skill.\u201d Elder Zhao looked complexly but expectantly at Zhao Feng.\u201cWhy is Elder Zhao so confident in me?\u201d Zhao Feng said.\u201cBecause your understanding of martial arts is very deep. You\u2019ve already trained core and middle ranked martial arts to the max level. You\u2019ve even trained Lightly Floating Ferry to a high degree.\u201d Elder Zhao praised.Zhao Feng immediately understood that Elder Zhao knew his understanding was very high and that he might be able to train Star Finger.\u201cLet me warn you.\u201d The elder\u2019s expression turned solemn.\u201cElder please speak.\u201dElder Zhao\u2019s eyes turned sharp: \u201cYou\u2019ll only have a chance to fight Zhao Linlong if you learn Star Finger and there\u2019s no certainty of winning.\u201dWhy?Zhao Feng didn\u2019t understand, wasn\u2019t Star Finger better than Spatial Cloud Finger?\u201cThis is because\u2026 \u201dElder Zhao let out a long sigh: \u201cSince Zhao Linlong came first and being the head of the sect\u2019s step son, he not only got an extra thousand blood plant, he was also allowed into the third floor of the Martial Arts Library.\u201dThird floor of the martial arts library?The mysterious third floor?Zhao Feng was shocked. Everyone knew that the second floor was mainly full of high ranked skills, and a few peak ranked skills. As for the third floor it was only a legend.\u201cZhao Linlong has received a thousand year blood plant and he has a high chance to break through to the sixth rank of the martial path in the next few months and become the head of the four geniuses. The higher ups of the sect are going to support him in whatever way they can.\u201d Speaking up to here Elder Zhao let out a sigh as he thought about Zhao Feng.After all, Zhao Feng\u2019s potential wasn\u2019t any weaker than Zhao Linlong\u2019s.Regretfully, he was a side branch disciple, while Zhao Linlong was of the direct branch and the head of the sect\u2019s stepson.Even if Zhao Feng had beaten Zhao Linlong that day, his treatment would\u2019ve been different.\u201cElder Zhao, can you tell me what\u2019s in the third floor? Could it be the legendary Holy ranked martial arts?\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s breathing rate increased.Holy ranked martial arts were a legend; one could reach the Holy Martial Path by cultivating them.\u201cHaha, do you think a small city like Sun Feather City could have a full copy of a Holy martial art?\u201d Elder Zhao shook his head but continued: \u201cBut Zhao Linlong does indeed have the chance to gain enlightenment from broken Holy martial arts.\u201dZhao Feng let out a long sigh. Soon, Zhao Feng gave the real copy of Star Finger back to Elder Zhao.\u201cYou don\u2019t want to copy it?\u201d The elder said curiously.\u201cI\u2019ve remembered it.\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t decide to hide this.Never forgetting wasn\u2019t that much of a big deal. Elder Zhao was surprised, but the happiness in his eyes were deeper; it looked like Zhao Feng was indeed a genius.Zhao Feng was still able to choose two high ranked martial arts after choosing the peak ranked skill. Elder Zhao recommended a movement skill named [Lightly Micro Step].\u201cThis skill is rumoured to have come from the same origins with Lightly Floating Ferry and it is almost a high ranked martial art.\u201d He explained.One peak ranked finger skill and one high ranked movement skill.Zhao Feng could still choose one more skill. This time, he chose [Withering Wood Technique].Withering Wood Technique was similar to Hiding Air Technique, it could conceal one\u2019s aura and smell. According to the description if Withering Wood Technique was trained to the high level, the cultivator could enter a \u2018fake death\u2019 state and escape the enemy\u2019s perception.\u201cYou have good eyesight, this skill has an extremely good effect.\u201d Elder Zhao smiled.After choosing his skills, Zhao Feng thanked the elder and left.Deng! Deng! Deng\u2026Right at this moment, steps sounded from outside the library.A total of three people stepped onto the second level. The first was a white-robed old man, the second a peaceful middle aged man and the last, a youth in gold. The last person was Zhao Linlong!Zhao Feng immediately bowed towards the first two: \u201cThis junior sees elder and head of the sect.\u201dThen he glance at at the youth clothed in gold and said smilingly: \u201cBig brother Linglong.\u201d\u201cEn.\u201d The head of the sect and the elder nodded their heads.But Zhao Linlong only faintly looked at him and glanced away without saying a word. This made Zhao Feng extremely awkward and irritated.After all, Zhao Feng was third in the inner disciples, and although Zhao Linlong was first, he couldn\u2019t disregard him.\u201cThe head of the sect and the elder is here, could it be\u2026\u201d Zhao Feng guessed.If they were to enter the second floor, only one of them was needed and not both. This meant that the two were sending Zhao Linlong to the third floor. It looks like what Elder Zhao said was true!Zhao Feng started to get angry, but he soon recovered as he thought about the dimension in his left eye.Zhao Feng headed straight home.Inside the room, he closed his eyes and the three skills Star Finger, Lightly Micro Step and Withering Wood Technique popped up inside his mind. Zhao Feng first tried to learn Lightly Micro Step and found that the style of it was similar to Lightly Floating Ferry.Half an hour later, he had reached the beginning level!Night.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng surprisingly found that when he used Air Crossing Breathing Technique with Lightly Micro Step, it was even faster.For the next few days, he concentrated on the new skills.Lightly Micro Step and Withering Wood Technique were both high ranked martial arts and Zhao Feng found them very easy to learn. It wasn\u2019t just because of the increase of enlightenment he got from his left eye, it was also because Lightly Floating Ferry and Hiding Air Technique set a very solid foundation for them both.By only using ten days, Zhao Feng had trained the two skills to the high level.Next he was going to train the most important skill, Star Finger! This finger skill was a peak ranked martial art which was hard to cultivate, back then even Elder Zhao didn\u2019t manage to train all of it.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 44": "Chapter 44Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 44 \u2013 Invitation of the Summit (1)Closing his eyes, Zhao Feng began to try and gain insight from Star Finger.Zhao Feng finally understood something after a few hours. This skill was indeed far harder than high ranked martial arts. In terms of difficulty, it could only be compared with Lightly Floating Ferry.But Star Finger wasn\u2019t just hard, it also had a certain amount of danger involved. When one condensed their Inner Strength, the slightest mistake could result in the cultivator being disabled.This meant that one needed to be extremely careful and not rush, so the improvement speed would be slow. However, Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye increased his mental energy, reaction speed, analysis and enlightenment, which meant that it was hard to go wrong.Star Finger\u2019s danger was put down to the minimum. Using one to two day\u2019s time, Zhao Feng\u2019s Star Finger barely managed to reach the first grade. The first grade of the Star Finger condensed the inner strength into one line and it had strong penetrating power. After reaching the first grade without even using Inner Strength, Zhao Feng could blast through stone with just a casual finger.He continued to train Star Finger. The second grade was much harder than the first grade, it needed the cultivator the condense the strength into one point instead of one line, which meant it had more explosive power.Zhao Feng used seven days just to reach the second grade. But the effect was very obvious, the damage was on par with high level high ranked skills. This meant that Zhao Feng\u2019s offense could dominate all of the Zhao sect disciples excluding Zhao Linlong. After reaching the second grade, Zhao Feng found that every step forward was extremely slow.Half a month later.Zhao Feng finally managed to reach the peak of the second grade. Zhao Feng finally met a bottleneck when he tried to break through to the third grade, it was obvious that it wouldn\u2019t be reached within a short amount of time.\u201cThis skill is indeed hard to train. I can\u2019t wait till I reach the fourth grade.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s expectations became bigger and bigger.Star Finger only needed to reach the fourth grade to attack through the air, which was the advantage that Martial Masters held.Back then, Elder Zhao had also trained this skill and he had used one to two years just to get it to the second grade.Zhao Feng had only used twenty-something days to reach the peak of the second grade.\u201cThis isn\u2019t the hardest skill yet. The move from the girl that day is far deeper and more complex\u2026 \u201c Zhao Feng remembered the Mysterious Wind Palm in his left eye\u2019s dimension.Obviously, Zhao Feng knew that he could only take one step at a time. Martial arts needed to be trained steadily, one couldn\u2019t instantly reach the skies.\u2026\u2026Soon, Zhao Feng\u2019s concentration returned to his cultivation and Inner Strength. When he was inside the cave, Zhao Feng\u2019s body had absorbed an enormous amount of medicine.At that time, the medicine hadn\u2019t been fully absorbed, there was still a small amount left within the body. After returning, Zhao Feng started to absorb the last bits by practising martial arts and cultivating.In the blink of an eye, another fifteen days passed.The remnants of the medicine had been absorbed. At this moment. his cultivation had reached the peak fifth rank, only half a step away from the sixth rank. As for his Inner Strength, it was on par with the sixth rank. If Zhao Feng wanted to break through to the sixth rank, there wouldn\u2019t be any bottlenecks present, he didn\u2019t even need to use the three thousand year old plants.\u201cI\u2019ll be able to reach the sixth rank in the next few days.\u201d Zhao Feng understood the changes in his body very well.Actually, most cultivators would had this feeling when they were about to break through. Therefore instead of cultivating, he decided to rest his body.Perfectly Zhao Yufei, his neighbour, came to find Zhao Feng to spar with him.One and a half month passed by since the martial arts contest. At this moment, Zhao Yufei\u2019s cultivation had reached the peak fourth rank, she could reach the fifth at any moment.\u201cBrother Feng I want to see your new skills.\u201d Zhao Yufei smiled. Her cheeks were faintly red and with her azure dress, she looked like a godess.\u201cSure.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head, he had also wanted to try out his skills.Inside the garden, the two figures intertwined with one another.First was the movement skills.Zhao Feng used Lightly Micro Step and his body became mysterious and blurry. When Lightly Micro Step was pushed to the extreme, there would be multiple after images of him stacked on top of each other.Speed was Zhao Yufei forte, but she was completely suppressed when facing Zhao Feng. Although both the skills were high ranked and reached the high level, the difference was very obvious.This made Zhao Yufei extremely puzzled. Because Zhao Feng had suppressed his cultivation to a level that was even lower than hers. And in terms of Inner Strength, both had trained Air Crossing Breathing Technique.\u201cYufei, your body\u2019s attributes aren\u2019t as good as mine and I also have Lightly Floating Ferry as foundation, so I have the upper hand in speed.\u201d Zhao Feng half truthfully, half lying spoke.The truth was that Lightly Floating Ferry and Lightly Micro Step were very similar. When used together, he was able to raise the skills to the peak rank.Next, they compared their offensive skills.Zhao Feng restrained his Star Finger to the beginning of the second grade, when his finger released a line of pure energy that could penetrate anything in it\u2019s way. Zhao Yufei was almost injured after one move.\u201cBrother Feng\u2019s skill is probably a peak ranked skill.\u201d Zhao Yufei was extremely envious.Peak ranked martial arts were very precious, of all the Zhao sect disciples, only Zhao Linlong, Zhao Chi and Zhao Feng had the chance to learn them.\u201cYou\u2019re right, this is indeed a peak ranked martial art.\u201d Zhao Feng was extremely please with Star Finger.Right at the moment, when the two were discussing their skills.\u201cHaha, little sister Yufei, I was going to spar with you, but you weren\u2019t home. So this is where you were?\u201dA man\u2019s voice sounded, the voice was casual and calm. On the garden wall stood a youth in gold around seventeen to eighteen years of age looking at Zhao Yufei.Zhao Linlong!Zhao Feng\u2019s eyebrows scrunched together. This was his home and Zhao Linlong came in without his permission. Furthermore, he was looking down on him, literally and metaphorically by standing on top of the wall.\u201cBig brother Linlong.\u201d Zhao Yufei smiled and gave the usual etiquette.After all, he was the top inner disciple and was the head of the sect\u2019s step son.\u201cBrother Linlong came again to spar with me?\u201dZhao Yufei was expressionless. Zhao Linlong had came to visit her countless times under the name of \u2018sparring\u2019. Every time she saw him, Zhao Yufei could feel the fieriness inside Zhao Linlong\u2019s eyes, which made her feel uneasy.\u201cThat\u2019s right, I hope sister Yufei won\u2019t reject me.\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s word contained absolute confidence.He didn\u2019t step into the garden, only standing on the wall. From the second he came in, he didn\u2019t even look at Zhao Feng once.\u201cThanks for your care, but brother Feng\u2019s just sparred with me.\u201d Zhao Yufei smiled as she rejected him.To spar with the genius of the Zhao sect was a countless number of girls\u2019 dreams.But Zhao Yufei didn\u2019t like Zhao Linlong at all. Zhao Linlong had an aura of loneliness and superiority, as if it was the other person\u2019s pleasure to be loved by him.This was completely opposite to Zhao Feng, who like her came from a branch sect and their sparring and communication came naturally. There wasn\u2019t any pressure at all.\u201cHim?\u201d Zhao Linlong \u2018finally\u2019 realised that Zhao Feng existed.After looking at Zhao Feng once, Zhao Linlong smiled but didn\u2019t speak, it was obvious that he was disdainful of him.\u201cThat\u2019s fine. Today I came to find sister Yufei for one other thing.\u201d Zhao Linlong shrugged his shoulders.\u201cPlease explain.\u201d\u201cThis thing\u2026 I want to speak to Yufei privately.\u201d Zhao Linlong glanced casually at Zhao Feng.\u201cBrother Feng, I\u2019ll leave first.\u201d Zhao Yufei said apologetically.Then the two walked out side by side.\u201cCould it be that Zhao Linlong is chasing after Yufei\u2026 ?\u201d Zhao Feng finally realised something.On the other side.Zhao Linlong took Zhao Yufei to a slightly remote area.\u201cYufei, in half a month\u2019s time, the Sun Feather City\u2019s yearly \u2018Genius Summit\u2019 will begin and the host is the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City \u2018Qiu Mengyu\u201d. At that time, all of the clans, sect, factions and families\u2019 geniuses will be invited.\u201d Zhao Linlong paused.Genius Summit! Most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City?Zhao Yufei\u2019s eye\u2019s flashed with surprise and expectancy. Zhao Yufei had only heard of the Genius Summit. This was an event for all the geniuses of Sun Feather City to come and spar with one another.The four great geniuses of Sun Feather City would also be decided there.\u201cThis is the most important event for the youths of Sun Feather City! Being the top Zhao disciple, I can recommend five people to join.\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s lips curled into a smile.\u201cOh? Genius Summit? I really want to experience it.\u201d Zhao Yufei was very interested in joining.\u201cOh yeah, who are you recommending?\u201d Zhao Yufei asked urgently.\u201cThere\u2019s Zhao Chi, Zhao Han, Zhao Qin, Zhao Ling\u2026 \u201dZhao Linlong didn\u2019t decide to hide anything.\u201cWait! Why isn\u2019t brother Zhao Feng coming? He came third!\u201d Zhao Yufei intercepted.\u201cZhao Feng?\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Linlong said casually: \u201cHe\u2019s just a branch disciple and he didn\u2019t even have the courage to challenge me. There\u2019s no point in taking someone like that to the Genius Summit.\u201d\u201cBut brother Feng\u2019s strength is still there\u2026 \u201d Zhao Yufei felt that this was unfair.\u201cHehe, it\u2019s ok, Yufei. I feel that I\u2019ll be able to reach the sixth rank soon and I\u2019ll become the head of the four great geniuses. Therefore, it doesn\u2019t matter who I choose, the point is that you\u2019ll be there with me, to witness my glory\u2026 \u201d Speaking up to here, Zhao Linlong\u2019s eyes turned hot and his hand couldn\u2019t help but reach towards Zhao Yufei\u2019s shoulders.\u201cZhao Linlong! Please behave yourself!\u201d Zhao Yufei\u2019s face turned cold as she blocked Zhao Linlong\u2019s hand.\u201cI never forced anyone into something they don\u2019t want. But Yufei, you\u2019ve got to believe me that no one will stop me from doing anything to the woman I love.

    "Chapter 45": "Chapter 45Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 45 \u2013 Invitation of the Summit (2)Inside the garden.Zhao Feng soon recovered as he watched the two of them walk out. He wanted to reach the pinnacle of martial arts and explore the outside world. A small city like Sun Feather City wouldn\u2019t be able to chain him.Zhao Feng only focused on cultivating, from training finger skills to movement skills, then inner strength skills to body strengthening techniques. He didn\u2019t know that the younger generation\u2019s geniuses had received an invitation to attend the genius summit. The invitation came from the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City, so all the youths were ready to show off their skills.That night.Zhao Chi, Zhao Han, Zhao Qin, Zhao Ling\u2026 received their invites. Not everyone was able to receive the invitations.Apparently, those that could be selected had to be at least at the fourth rank.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know anything about this. Zhao Yufei was pacing around in her house, wondering if she should tell him the news.The third day after the invitations were sent out.Zhao Feng sat cross-legged on the ground with his eyes closed. His body suddenly gave off an unrestrainable aura.Hu~The force swept past everything in view, rattling the windows and blowing the chairs away.Suddenly.The youth\u2019s eyes opened and two arcs of lightning seemed to flash through his eyes.\u201cMy Inner Strength has reached the sixth rank.\u201d Excitement and happiness flashed in his eyes, but instantly he circulated Withering Wood Technique and suppressed it to the fifth rank.The reason why his Inner Strength reached the sixth rank so quickly was because of the cave. Even Metal Wall Technique was half a step away from the fifth level.Once Metal Wall Technique reached the fifth rank, the cultivator did not only have a body of steel, they could also shatter weapons with just their body. It also meant that those that were weaker than Zhao Feng would harm themselves from the recoil. At this moment, his Metal Wall Technique was limitlessly close to the fifth level and his cultivation was almost at the sixth.\u201cMy cultivation level and Metal Wall Technique will break through in the next two days or so.\u201d Zhao Feng was full of expectations.The sixth rank of the martial path and the fifth level of Metal Wall Technique. Zhao Feng had confidence that he could beat any disciples within the Zhao sect if he fought any one of them.On the same day.Inside an old but glorious garden within the Zhao sect.\u201cSixth rank of the martial path\u2026 Faster than I expected.\u201d Zhao Linlong clothed in his usual gold robe stood up and a powerful aura surged around him.Hu!He released a dominating aura and everything within a few metres radius was ripped into shreds.\u201cNot bad, you\u2019re only eighteen years old and you\u2019ve reached the sixth rank. This breaks Sun Feather\u2019s City\u2019s record.\u201d The head of the sect, Zhao Tiancang, looked praisingly at him.\u201cIf I didn\u2019t have a thousand year blood plant and didn\u2019t have stepfather performing \u201cInner Strength Vein Opener technique\u201d, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to reach the sixth rank so quickly.\u201d Zhao Linlong said humbly.Although he had reached the sixth rank, he still was small and tiny compared to his stepfather. The difference between the sixth and seventh rank was massive, just like the third and fourth ranks. It was only one in ten cultivators who progressed to the fourth rank. And out of the sixth ranked cultivators, there was only one in a hundred of them that progressed to the seventh rank.\u201cNext, you need to concentrate on martial arts. The Genius Summit is close, you\u2019d better earn some face for the Zhao sect.\u201d Zhao Tiancang said smiling.\u201cDon\u2019t worry stepfather, no one can stop me apart from Xin Wuheng. And according to the rumours, Xin Wuheng is only at the peak fifth rank. I have at least sixty percent a chance of beating him.\u201d Zhao Linlong said confidently.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Time passed quickly.The days till the Genius Summit creeped closer and closer. Sun Feather City became busier and busier as the summit approached.Some just came to see the most beautiful girl\u2019s figure.At this time, the information that Zhao Linlong had reached the sixth rank spread like wildfire throughout Sun Feather City. This obviously shocked countless youngsters and caused waves in the three major powers.Sixth rank of the martial path!For those youngsters, this was an incredible feat. There was no one comparable with Zhao Linlong in Sun Feather City.However, no one knew that Zhao Linlong was not the only one who had reached the sixth rank.In a garden of the Zhao sect.A youth started to walk on air, his afterimages blurred throughout the area.Teng!Zhao Feng\u2019s body landed on the ground as lightly as a leaf. If one looked closely, they would realise that Zhao Feng\u2019s figure was even more straighter now. His body was much bigger than that of an average adult\u2019s, even though he was only fourteen years old.His cultivation and Metal Wall Technique had both broken through seven days ago. At that time, he was completely confident that no one would be his opponent in Sun Feather City.He had been trying to gain insights from Star Finger and Lightly Micro Step the past few days.Lightly Micro Step had reached the peak level.Now, Zhao Feng concentrated on Star Finger. His Star Finger had finally been trained to the third grade.Hu Qi\u2014\u2013Zhao Feng\u2019s second finger left an afterimage in the air.\u201cHe!\u201dZhao Feng condensed his Inner Strength into one point and the air around it seemed to tremble.Shua~In the dark night, the star formed from his Inner Strength didn\u2019t dissipate straight away. Instead, it left a mark in the sky, leaving a beautiful view.This move was the killing move of Star Finger \u2013 \u201cOne Point Star Finger\u201d.\u201cOne Point Star Finger\u201d\u2019s power had reached an extreme level. Once it was used perfectly, he could defeat anyone of the same rank and this skill also suppressed body strengthening techniques. Zhao Feng believed that not many people under the seventh rank were able to block this move.But \u201cOne Point Star Finger\u201d also had disadvantages.The first was the completion rate. There was a twenty to thirty percent chance of being able to use One Point Star Finger since he had only reached the third grade.The second had danger involved. If he failed, his capillaries could rupture. Back then, Elder Zhao\u2019s Star Finger had only reached the third grade.\u201cIf I\u2019m to use my left eye, I\u2019ll have a forty to fifty percent chance of being able to successfully use it and the chance of failing and injuring my finger is ten percent.\u201d Zhao Feng analysed.Obviously, as his grade increased, the succession rate would also increase.Most people would have a forty to fifty percent chance when they reached the peak of the third grade. There was a seventy to eighty percent chance at the fourth grade. And at the fifth grade, there was a hundred percent success rate. As for the sixth grade or higher, the damage was not limited to One Point Star Finger. If one didn\u2019t have a Holy martial art, they were done for\u2026But it was still too far away for Zhao Feng. He was most expectant for the fourth grade.\u201cYoung master Zhao Feng, you\u2019ve received an invite.\u201d A servant came from outside and said respectfully.Zhao Feng felt weird and saw the words on the azure paper: Genius Summit.Genius Summit?Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know anything about this Summit.On the bottom of the letter had a few small words.Organiser: Qiu Mengyu.Zhao Feng felt that this name was familiar.\u201cWho\u2019s this Qiu Mengyu?\u201d Zhao Feng asked on instinct.\u201cYoung master Zhao Feng, Qiu Mengyu is the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City and she is also one of the four great geniuses.\u201d The servant tried to remain expressionless.Qiu Mengyu, the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City. Someone didn\u2019t even know her?Sou!As soon as the servant left, a faint purple figure floated into the garden.\u201cBrother Feng, did you just get the invite from the summit?\u201d The dimples on Zhao Yufei cheeks were alluring.\u201cWhat is this Genius Summit?\u201d Zhao Feng still didn\u2019t know what it was.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what the Genius Summit is? I even\u2026 \u201d Zhao Yufei\u2019s mouth was wide open as she stood shocked.She was also a bit angry: she had gone to the Qiu family and finally gotten another invite.\u201cSister Yufei what is the Genius Summit?\u201d Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t restrain himself from asking again.He didn\u2019t know how the invites were arranged. Originally, Zhao Linlong had five recommendations, but he didn\u2019t give one to Zhao Feng. Zhao Yufei didn\u2019t tell Zhao Feng about this. Instead, she went to the Qiu family and finally got Zhao Feng another invite.\u201cHmph ,if you don\u2019t know then don\u2019t worry about it.\u201d Zhao Yufei hmphed and she left Zhao Feng\u2019s garden.Hm?Zhao Feng felt weird since Zhao Yufei seemed to be angry. This was the first time that she had gotten angry.\u201cGenius summit? I\u2019ll go and check it out then. I wonder if the most beautiful girl is even prettier than Zhao Yufei?\u201d Zhao Feng finally felt interested.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHe opened the letter and on it wrote the place and time.\u201cWhat!? Not good!\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s expression changed, because the starting time was tonight.At this time, the sun had already gone down. There was only half an hour left.\u201cWait!

All she did was go towards their destination, but her crystal eyes would still secretly glance at the youth behind her.Zhao Feng finally felt that she had calmed down, so he started to ask about the genius summit again.\u201cThe genius summit is a yearly event and all the talented youths would get an invitation\u2026 \u201d Zhao Yufei explained the situation.It was an event where the youths sparred one another and choosed the four great geniuses.Soon, the two arrived at the main gate of the Zhao sect. At the gate stood a few people, including Zhao Linlong, Zhao Chi and Zhao Han.\u201cSister Yufei, we\u2019re just waiting for you\u2026 \u201d Zhao Linlong smiled and released his aura.The aura of the sixth rank made the other disciples nearby tremble in fear. Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei walked towards the others.Apart from the top five inner disciples, Zhao Qin and Zhao Ling were also present.\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Seeing Zhao Feng here, Zhao Linlong scrunched his eyebrows.\u201cWhy? Does brother Linlong not welcome me?\u201d Zhao Feng was slightly curious.Why couldn\u2019t he come?It should be normal for him to attend the Genius Summit since he was the third strongest.\u201cHehe.\u201dZhao Linlong hid the mockery in his eyes and he didn\u2019t pay Zhao Feng anymore attention. Zhao Feng once again had the feeling of being disregarded.The few disciples that were present such as Zhao Chi and Zhao Qin somewhat knew the reason. There was only a certain number of spots for the Genius Summit and Zhao Linlong had not given one of them to Zhao Feng.According to the rules, if Zhao Feng doesn\u2019t have an invite, he won\u2019t be able to enter.\u201cZhao Linlong is wanting to see him lose face\u2026 \u201c Zhao Chi and Zhao Han had sympathy within their eyes.Zhao Feng felt the atmosphere was a bit tense and the way they looked at him was weird.\u201cOk, let\u2019s go!\u201d Zhao Linlong gave the order.\u201cThe destination is the Yanbo Lake near the Qiu family\u2019s place.\u201d Zhao Yufei spun around and warned Zhao Feng as if he would get lost.Soon, a small lake appeared.On one side of the lake, there was a mountain one thousand metres high. The lake also circled around half the mountain. The meeting point was at the point of the mountain.The small group of them started to use their movement skills and started to run up the mountain.On the top of the mountain, there were the figures of a few Qiu family disciples. Since the organiser was Qiu Mengyu, this place was obviously also their territory.\u201cCan you all please show your invitations?\u201d Seven to eight disciples of the Qiu family stood in a line.These youngsters were not normal youths, they were all talented Qiu family disciples. All of them had reached the fifth rank or higher and they were between the ages of twenty to thirty.The youths all took out their invites and gave them up.Zhao Linlong led the Zhao sect disciples into the checkpoint.First, it was Zhoa Linlong. Then, it was Zhao Chi, Zhao Han\u2026Finally, only Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei were left. At this moment, Zhao Linlong\u2019s lips curled into a smile as he looked at Zhao Feng.\u201cThis is my invite.\u201d Zhao Feng took out the letter.\u201cYep, that\u2019s correct.\u201d The cultivator nodded his head and let Zhao Feng in.This scene made Zhao Linlong\u2019s smile freeze. Zhao Chi and Zhao Han were both surprised.What the heck?How did Zhao Feng get an invitation?Zhoa Feng saw their reactions. He instinctively turned his eyes to look at Zhao Yufei, where the latter dodged his eyes and hurriedly gave up her invitation.The group of seven successfully entered the place. Zhao Feng was curious as he felt that his invitation was different from the others.Zhao Yufei smiled: \u201cIf you want to know the answer, you have to become first in the genius summit\u2026 \u201dZhao Feng shook his head and he didn\u2019t think about it any more. This scene made Zhao Linlong scan coldly at Zhao Feng as if he was warning him. Zhao Feng felt the warning and enmity, but he didn\u2019t put it in his heart.He didn\u2019t fear Zhao Linlong at all with his current strength. The Zhao sect disciples soon entered a pavilion where servants would pour tea for them.The pavilion they were in was closest to the center of the open area.There was three pavilions equally close to the centre: The Qiu, Xin and Zhao families, representing the largest powers in Sun Feather City.Zhao Feng looked at the pavilion on his left and he found that Xin Tong and Xin Fei were also there. Xin Fei had already reached the peak fourth rank and Xin Tong had just reached the fifth.Obviously, their cultivating speed was still slower than Zhao Feng\u2019s and Zhao Yufei\u2019s.Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei\u2019s cultivation levels had both reached the fifth rank. At least, thats what it looked like and they were the youngest present.\u201cThe top genius of the Xin family is called Xin Wuheng and he is the head of the four great geniuses. At last year\u2019s summit, the other three great geniuses weren\u2019t even able to block ten of his moves.\u201d Zhao Qin said quietly.Following her eyesight, Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes locked onto a normal azure clothed youth who had his eyes closed. The azure clothed youth was around sixteen to seventeen years of age and he had a normal face.He was Xin Wuheng and his cultivation level seemed to be at the peak fifth rank. Facing Xin Wuheng, even the arrogant Zhao Linlong\u2019s expression turned solemn.When Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye locked onto Xin Wuheng, he couldn\u2019t help but take a deep breath. This person wasn\u2019t simple at all\u2026Facing Zhao Linlong, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t feel any pressure at all. But facing this person, he could feel the pressure radiating off him. Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye could see what other\u2019s couldn\u2019t\u2026..As if he felt something, Xin Wuheng\u2019s eyes suddenly opened. The second he opened his eyes, Zhao Feng could see the clear pupils, instantly turning the normal face into a handsome one.\u201cXin Wuheng!\u201d Zhao Linlong spat out as he looked towards Xin Wuheng.However, Xin Wuheng didn\u2019t look at this so-called number one disciple of the Zhao sect. Instead, his eyes landed on Zhao Feng.\u201cNot bad. There\u2019s finally someone that interests me.\u201d Xin Wuheng nodded his head.As soon as he finished, he closed his eyes once more, not even bothering to look at Zhao Linlong.What?Zhao Linlong forcefully pushed down his anger. No one from the younger generation had the courage to look down on him. But he just couldn\u2019t get angry at Xin Wuheng. After all, Xin Wuheng had beaten him in ten moves last year.\u201cWho\u2019s this guy? To be so important to Xin Wuheng?\u201d Many looked towards Zhao Feng.Xin Fei and Xin Tong were also included.Xin Fei\u2019s will to battle was raging and Xin Tong seemed to be expectant as well: \u201cThat kid\u2019s cultivation speed is legendary, he\u2019s reached the fifth rank as well.\u201dZhao Linlong felt cheated at how importantly Xin Wuheng looked at Zhao Feng. Xin Wuheng was obviously not putting him in his eyes!\u201cXin Wuheng\u2026 you\u2019ll soon see who\u2019ll be your true opponent.\u201d Zhao Linlong laughed coldly to himself.At night fell, more and more people arrived. Inside the pavilions, there were the talented youths and guests of high status.There was around forty to fifty youths invited and the spectators reached around one hundred.Just at this moment, a disruption was caused.\u201cLook! Qiu Mengyu is here!\u201d\u201cThe most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City!\u201dThe crowd exclaimed and then fell into dead silence.On the red carpet, there was a girl clothed in azure. Her hair seemed to flow with the air and with her majestic face, she seemed to be made of jade.Qiu Mengyu was seventeen to eighteen years old and every move she made was elegant. Every smile she gave was full of flavour, not like Zhao Yufei and Zhao Qin who were both shy.\u201cNo wonder she\u2019s rated the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t forget that Qiu Mengyu is also one of the four great geniuses.\u201dMany of the talented youths were dazed.There was only Zhao Yufei who could be compared to her. But Zhao Yufei was younger, only fourteen to fifteen, and her pureness seemed so natural. Therefore, she wasn\u2019t as attractive as Qiu Mengyu.Under the crowd\u2019s attention, Qiu Mengyu stepped inside the Qiu family\u2019s pavilion.\u201cToday, I have the honour to host this year\u2019s summit where all the talented youths within a one thousand radius were invited\u2026. \u201d Qiu Mengyu\u2019s voice was like a gentle creek flowing, attracting even more attention.She was indeed pretty!Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but look at Qiu Mengyu a few more times and Zhao Yufei at his side snorted.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThere was also a youth clothed in white within the Qiu families pavilion who had reached the peak of the fifth rank.\u201cThat person is called Qiu Changyi and he is also one of the four great geniuses.\u201d Zhao Qin introduced him.\u201cThis means that two of the four great geniuses are from the Qiu family?\u201d Zhao Feng was slightly stunned.\u201cYes, the Qiu family\u2019s power in Sun Feather City is strong and they are enemies of our Zhao family, so we usually have a few fights break out.\u201d Zhao Chi added.At this moment, the four great geniuses of Sun Feather City stood up: Zhao Linlong, Xin Wuheng, Qiu Mengyu, and Qiu Changyi.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 47": "Chapter 47Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 47 \u2013 Showing his skillsLast year, the four great geniuses had been ranked, with Xin Wuheng easily coming first. Second was Qiu Mengyu, third Zhao Linlong and fourth Qiu Changyi.First was at the Xin family, while second and fourth were both the Qiu family competitors. The Zhao family was easily last. But this year, it had all changed!Not only did Zhao Linlong reach the sixth rank, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei had both reached the fifth rank at such young ages.The families only compared how many of the younger generations had reached the fifth rank or higher.The Zhao family had five: Zhao Linlong, Zhao Chi, Zhao Feng, Zhao Han, and Zhao Yufei.The Xin family only had three, including Xin Tong who had just reached the fifth rank.The Qiu family had four which included Qiu Mengyu and Qiu Changyi, two of the four great geniuses.\u201cThis year\u2019s summit will be intense\u2026.\u201dZhao family\u2019s dominance made the other two families feel pressured.When everyone had arrived, the summit officially started. The summit was mainly for sparring and communicating. According to the rules, anyone could show off their skills or challenge someone.After they finished sparring the two would exchange pointers.On the clear open space in the middle of the summit.\u201cI\u2019ve trained a skill named Swiping Cloud Leg and it has reached the peak level.\u201dA youth kicked out with both legs. Soon, he began to kick even faster. Finally, only an afterimage was left. It was like a chaotic storm of legs.\u201cNot bad. To be able to train a middle ranked skill to the peak level.\u201dThe people praised.This youth wasn\u2019t from the three major families. Instead, he was the top genius from a small family.After showing off, his fiery hot eyes stared at Qiu Mengyu: \u201cI wish to spar with the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City.\u201dAs soon as he finished, he caused a crowd outrage.\u201cJust you? You want to spar with Qiu Mengyu? In your dreams!\u201d\u201cYou first have to beat me if you want to challenge Qiu Mengyu!\u201d From the Qiu family, a youth of the fourth rank sprang out.The two soon clashed together. The person from the Qiu family had cultivated a high ranked martial art. Obviously, the Qiu family disciple won after fifty to sixty moves.\u201cHmph! You still have face to come to the summit with your puny strength?\u201d The Qiu family disciple mocked.The talented youths from the three big families had better cultivation techniques and skills. Therefore, their strength was much stronger than the others on the level.This youth was soon challenged by someone from the Xin family.The summit had a rule. The sparring at the beginning was only for those at the fourth rank. The people of the fifth rank or higher couldn\u2019t join in.Soon, Zhao Qin and Zhao Ling from the Zhao sect went up, both winning and losing some.As time passed, the strength of those onstage became stronger and stronger.\u201cI, Zhao Han, want to see how strong you are.\u201d Zhao Han on the centre of the open ground.His eyes scanned the cultivators of the fifth rank from the Xin and Qiu family. Although the Xin family only had three, their strength were all strong.\u201cI\u2019ll do it!\u201d Xin Tong slowly stood up and threw off the grass hat on his head.He had sparred with Zhao Han the last time. But because his cultivation level was lower, he had lost.\u201cDefeated trash!\u201d Zhao Han coldly laughed and attacked first.\u201cSteel Wall Arm!\u201dXin Tong\u2019s arm turned to bronze and the muscles on his arm tightened. Under the circulation of his Inner Strength, it headed straight towards Zhao Han.Ice Cold Palm!A weird ice cold Inner Strength radiated from Zhao Han and it appeared on his palm.Pah\u2014-The two energies clashed heavily together. Zhao Han was knocked back a few steps while Xin Tong felt his arm turn numb from coldness.The two had their own advantages: Zhao Han\u2019s advantage was that his Inner Strength was at the peak fifth rank, while Xin Tong\u2019s was that his body strength and defense was stronger.Because Xin Tong had reached the fifth rank, his Inner Strength had also reached this level, and combined with Steel Wall Arm, it had become even more powerful.The two exchanged tens of blows without seeing an end result.But as time passed, Zhao Han started to feel tired. Every time they clashed, his arm would turn numb.And since Xin Tong\u2019s defense was extremely strong, he didn\u2019t get injured easily.Finally, after one hundred or so moves, Zhao Han started to weaken while Xin Tong started to attack more fiercely.\u201cThe spar ends here.\u201d Qiu Mengyu gently smiled and stopped the two.Next, she analysed the two\u2019s strengths and weaknesses: \u201cZhao Han, although your Inner Strength is very strong, it\u2019s foundation isn\u2019t very solid. I recommend that you train a body strengthening technique. As for Xin Tong, although your defense is your forte and your offense is also powerful, you rely too much on pure power. Your martial arts skills aren\u2019t up to scratch\u2026\u201dQiu Mengyu\u2019s analysis was perfect. Other than her, there were also others that joined in the discussion. They also decided that Xin Tong had won this match.\u201cHehe, who\u2019s going to come from the Zhao family? Zhao Linlong? Or Zhao Feng?\u201d Xin Tong had his arms crossed and he chewed on a piece of grass as he looked at the Zhao family.There were too many talented people in the Zhao family from this generation, so the other families had teamed up to challenge the Zhao family\u2019s geniuses.Finally, Xin Tong\u2019s eyes locked onto Zhao Feng as he didn\u2019t have any confidence in beating Zhao Linlong. Zhao Linlong\u2019s cultivation had reached the sixth rank and no one apart from the four great geniuses would have the courage to challenge him.\u201cYou\u2019ve just had a battle, even if I won it wouldn\u2019t be fair.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled faintly and stood up.What he said was true, Xin Tong had just fought fiercely with Zhao Han and his energy was depleted.But his words caused the Xin family disciples to feel disgust.\u201cKid! Don\u2019t be too arrogant!\u201d\u201cHmph! Stop using excuses!\u201dThe main reason was because Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t very famous in Sun Feather City and so not many people knew him and only thought of him as a slightly talented youth of the younger generation.Zhao Feng was only famous win the Zhao family as he almost never left the family grounds.Only Xin Fei of the Xin family had a solemn look on.Qiu Mengyu gave a suggestion: \u201cWhy not let Xin Tong rest a while while Zhao Feng spars with others?\u201dHer clear crystal eyes glanced interestingly at Zhao Feng and then she looked at Zhao Yufei not far away. Zhao Yufei was slightly embarrassed and stuck out her tongue.Zhao Feng felt slightly weird, it was as if Qiu Mengyu knew him.\u201cDoes anyone want to spar with me?\u201d He said smilingly.\u201cLet me go!\u201d A scar-faced youth jumped out from the Xin family\u2019s pagonda.It was Xin Fei. After two months, Xin Fei\u2019s cultivation had reached the peak of the fourth rank.\u201cYou\u2019re not my opponent.\u201d Zhao Feng looked at Xin Fei calmly.\u201cI know.\u201d Xin Fei took a deep breath as his eyes turned sharp.Shua\u2014-The blade in his hand sliced through the air, wave after wave.\u201cInsane Wind Dance!\u201dXin Fei\u2019s blade skill was pushed to the extreme, and the area in a radius of one metre was devastated by his \u201cSong of the Blade Dancing\u201d.Facing such an attack, Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but feel stunned. Xin Fei\u2019s strength was able to challenge those of the fifth rank. In terms of offense, Xin Fei had even exceeded Xin Tong.Lightly Micro Step!Zhao Feng\u2019s figure suddenly became unstable and after-images of him would be left everywhere he went.Shua! Shua! Shua\u2026Xin Fei\u2019s every attack would only hit the after-images that Zhao Feng left which would then turn into void. Zhao Feng easily dodged Xin Fei\u2019s attack and the latter wasn\u2019t even able to touch his clothes.\u201cZhao Feng\u2019s speed skill is similar to Zhao Linlong\u2019s Shadow Step.\u201d Zhao Chi was secretly surprised.Angry Dragon Fist!Zhao Feng suddenly unleashed an attack and his fist was like a roaring dragon that smashed towards Xin Fei.Peng! Dang!The fist and long blade clashed many times, but Xin Fei was sent backwards with every attack. This was the result even when Zhao Feng had suppressed his cultivation to the peak fourth rank.Dang~Ten moves later, Xin Fei\u2019s blade was knocked flying by Zhao Feng\u2019s finger. That one finger seemed extremely normal, but it contained immense energy. Xing Fei\u2019s blade flew tens of metres away and clanged on the ground.\u201cYou\u2019re the only one I admire apart from Xin Wuheng.\u201d Xin Fei didn\u2019t seem depressed as he turned around to pick up his blade.Only after motivation and pressure would his strength increase.\u201cYou\u2019ll one day become a top blade master.\u201d Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but praise him, he saw the potential and grit within him which he didn\u2019t see in others.Although his opponent was only at the fourth rank, people could see that this was not the limit of his strength. Especially his last move, one tap of his finger had sent Xin Fei\u2019s blade flying.\u201cZhao Feng, it seems like you\u2019ve improved a lot!\u201d Xin Tong slowly rose.After resting for a while, he had mainly recovered since he hadn\u2019t been injured by Zhao Han in the match before.\u201cThis time, I\u2019ll take back what I lost to you last time.\u201d Zhao Feng said.\u201cStop being humble, that time you hadn\u2019t even reached the fourth rank and I wasn\u2019t even able to reach your speed. However, I hope that you don\u2019t just dodge this time and fight like a man instead.\u201d\u201cThen let us begin.\u201d Zhao Feng took a deep breath and threw out a simple fist.\u201cGood!\u201d Xin Tong laughed wildly, he never feared anyone if they fought him straight on.Peng!The two fists that seemed to be made out of steel clashed heavily together and caused a major explosion.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHu~The forced crushed out towards the surrounding area. Many geniuses present felt their ear\u2019s tremble.\u201cWhat terrifying strength!\u201dMany spectators felt their heart jump, just that sound alone shocked them. The two figures stood like stone statues in the middle of the stage. The whole stage fell silent.After a short moment, a figure trembled spat out a mouthful of blood.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 48": "Chapter 48Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 48 \u2013 The Power of Star FingerThere were no tricks and skills involved, only pure power. The result was decided with one move.Many people had expressions of disbelief.The one that was injured was Xin Tong!Xin Tong was well known throughout Sun Feather City for his strength, he was at the top of the ladder, just below the four great geniuses at the previous summit.In many people\u2019s opinions, Xin Tong\u2019s body strengthening technique was extremely powerful. No one thought that he would lose in terms of pure power.\u201cI lost\u2026 if I\u2019m not wrong, you\u2019ve learnt Metal Wall Technique and you have at least reached the peak of the fourth level.\u201d Xin Tong wiped the blood leaking from his mouth.He knew what skill Zhao Feng learnt. Metal Wall Technique was far more profound than Bronze Body Technique, but it was harder to train as well.\u201cYou\u2019re right.\u201dZhao Feng didn\u2019t pretend that he had learnt something else. But his Metal Wall Technique was not at the peak of the fourth level anymore, it had reached the fifth level a few days ago!\u201cWhen did Sun Feather City have such a person!?\u201d\u201cHis body strength surpasses Xin Tong\u2019s. In terms of pure body defense, his is probably the best in Sun Feather City.\u201dAfter beating Xin Tong, Zhao Feng\u2019s fame spread like a wildfire through the younger generation.After the sparring match, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t remain on stage and he returned to the Zhao family pavilion instead.Zhao Han and Zhao Chi looked solemnly at him.Zhao Han was extremely shocked, he couldn\u2019t even beat Xin Tong in one hundred moves and Xin Tong was defeated by Zhao Feng in only one move. It looked like that the distance between them was starting to get bigger and bigger\u2026Obviously as Zhao Feng and Xin Tong contested in terms of pure power, only winning in one move was normal. Therefore, Zhao Linlong was only slightly stunned, but he soon regained his composure.One genius after another showed off their skills.Half the time it takes for an incense to burn later.\u201cHehehe, it\u2019s finally my turn\u2026. \u201dFrom the Zhao family, a lazy youth who was at the fifth rank came out! The one that came out this time was Zhao Chi.In the ranking tournament, Zhao Chi was even ranked higher than Zhao Feng. Zhao Chi not only had a high cultivation level, every skill he learnt had also reached a high tier.Instantly, he defeated geniuses of the fifth rank from the Qiu and Xin family. Especially at the end, Zhao Chi\u2019s peak ranked martial art was extremely powerful. Now Zhao Chi\u2019s fame had surpassed Zhao Feng\u2019s. Next, he could only challenge the four great geniuses.Xin Wuhen, Qiu Mengyu, Qiu Changyi.\u201cQiu Changyi, I won\u2019t lost this time like last year.\u201d Zhao Chi was pretty confident.\u201cHaha! Although you\u2019ve made major improvements, it won\u2019t be easy for you to beat me.\u201d Qiu Changyi was dressed like a handsome scholar.The two soon intertwined with one another. Facing Zhao Chi, even one the four great geniuses Qiu Changyi had to go all out. This was because Zhao Chi\u2019s offense, defense, speed were all flawlessly top class. The fact that he had also learnt a peak ranked martial art made Zhao Chi even stronger.Qiu Changyi\u2019s forte was speed.Sou Sou Sou!In the night, a white clothed figure could been seen flying through the air like the wind.Flowing Feather Step! Flowing Feather Flying Cloud!Qiu Changyi\u2019s footstep skills compensated one another, making the power massively increase.His Flowing Feather Flying Cloud had even reached the peak level. There was only one person who had trained a high ranked speed skill to the peak level in the Zhao family.Zhao Qin said: \u201cQiu Changyi is the fastest amongst the younger generation, everyone who met him last year would get a headache.\u201dThe two figures exchanged blows quickly. Zhao Chi was even in every aspect and although he lacked speed he was still able to stand his ground.According to the rules, if the spar was even, the audience would decide the winner. After a long discussion, it was finally decided that Qiu Changyi won. The reason being Qiu Changyi had the upper hand and the judge was from the Qiu family. Although it was slightly unfair, no one said anything.After Qiu Changyi won, he didn\u2019t return to his family. He looked at Zhao Yufei instead.\u201cLady Yufei.\u201dQiu Changyi had a faint smile on and he didn\u2019t hide his passion. Being with Qiu Mengyu often meant that he had resistance towards hot girls, yet his eyes lit up the moment he saw Zhao Yufei.If he missed this girl, he would regret it for life.\u201cQiu Changyi, do you want to spar with me?\u201d Zhao Yufei smiled. Not a trace of fear was seen on her face.\u201cNo! The one I want to challenge is him!\u201d Qiu Changyi\u2019s eyes landed on the person next to her.The twist made dumbfounded many.Why me?Although Zhao Feng didn\u2019t fear him, he felt baffled.\u201cI want to know what is so special about Brother Zhao, so special that Zhao Yufei had to come for another invitation.\u201d Qiu Changyi\u2019s eyes stared at Zhao Feng.He knew that there was a high chance that Zhao Yufei liked Zhao Feng. To replace that position in her heart, he must beat Zhao Feng.\u201cWhat!? Yufei begged for an invite just because of him?\u201d Jealousy rose within Zhao Linlong\u2019s heart.He couldn\u2019t help but look at Zhao Feng in a new light.\u201cThank you, Yufei.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled gratefully towards Zhao Yufei.He finally knew how he got his invitation. With Zhao Linlong not putting him in sight at all, there was a high chance of him not receiving an invitation.\u201cWe\u2019re good friends, neighbours! If you want to thank me, beat him.\u201d Zhao Yufei smiled like a lotus blooming.That moment, her beauty surpassed the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City, Qiu Mengyu.\u201cSure.\u201d Zhao Feng felt a fire burning in his heart.He wasn\u2019t fighting for anything, just Zhao Yufei going to the Qiu family alone for another invitation gives him the reason to not lose.\u201cI hope you don\u2019t let Lady Yufei down.\u201dQiu Changyi seemed normal, but within his heart, he was slightly jealous and envious.However, the real one who was jealous was actually Zhao Linlong.\u201cWhy\u2026. How can this branch sect disciple steal my woman!?\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s face flashed coldly in the darkness.Right at this moment, the two figures clashed together. Qiu Chanyi\u2019s white robe enhanced his handsomeness and he immediately became the centre of attention for the girls. However, his opponents speed wasn\u2019t slow either.Lightly Micro Step! Lightly Floating Ferry!Zhao Feng showed off his speed skills. These two skills of his came from the same origins. Up till now, Zhao Feng\u2019s Lightly Floating Ferry had reached the low level, but it was only one step away from the high level.However the rank of this skill couldn\u2019t be measured, it had to the potential to even exceed peak ranked martial arts. In terms of speed, Zhao Feng only used seventy to eighty percent to fight on par with Qiu Changyi.\u201cHow\u2026 how can this guy\u2019s speed not be any slower than me?\u201d Qiu Changyi started to sweat more and more from his back.He had always been the fastest cultivator of the youngest generation of Sun Feather City. But now, there was someone who was not any slower than him. However, Zhao Feng\u2019s body strengthening technique and offensive skills surpassed his.\u201cStar Finger!\u2019 Zhao Feng shouted and pointed his finger.Shua~The finger condensed all his Inner Strength into one point and it swept across the dark night.Pu!Qiu Changyi didn\u2019t have the time to dodge so he had to face it straight on, the end result was that his entire arm went numb. Furthermore, there was a chaotic Inner Strength rampaging throughout his body.Teng! Teng! Teng\u2026His body was sent back a few steps before he stopped.\u201cPeak ranked martial arts? How can I lose\u2026 ?\u201d Qiu Changyi clenched his teeth as he started to unleash his killing move.Pah!A hand that seemed to made out of bronze gently tapped his shoulder.What!?Qiu Changyi felt himself turn cold. As the opponent stood dazed, Zhao Feng had found his flaws and he had used unparalleled speed to move behind him.\u201cI lost?\u201d Qiu Changyi seemed to lose his spirit as he stood there in disbelief.But reality was cruel. Zhao Feng\u2019s speed wasn\u2019t any slower than his, Zhao Feng\u2019s offense surpassed his, he had even learnt Star Finger, one of the most famous peak ranked martial arts.\u201cStar Finger?\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s heart lept.Star Finger was similar to Spatial Cloud Finger, both were extremely powerful peak ranked martial arts.The head of the sect Zhao Tiancang had once said: \u201cThe skill I\u2019m teaching you now, Spatial Cloud Finger, is one of the most powerful peak ranked martial arts within the Zhao family. No one can stand against you unless they have learnt Star Finger. In that case, you will lose.\u201d\u201cThen why not teach me Star Finger instead?\u201d Zhao Linlong asked curiously.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cStar Finger is too hard to train, the slightest mistake would festroy one\u2019s future talents. And even though I\u2019m the head of the sect, I can\u2019t allow you to go and select more peak ranked martial arts.\u201d\u2026\u2026The scene replayed inside Zhao Linlong\u2019s mind.\u201cPhew, it looks like Zhao Feng\u2019s Star Finger is only at the second level. If it was at the third level, then it would be difficult\u2026\u201d Zhao Linlong slightly let out a breath.From the situation right now, it looked like Zhao Feng\u2019s Star Finger hadn\u2019t reached the third level yet.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Why haven\u2019t I heard of him before?\u201d\u201cHe just beat Xin Tong in one move, and now even Qiu Changyi lost to him.\u201dThe chaos far surpassed anything before because Qiu Changyi was one of the four great geniuses. Beating Qiu Changyi ,Zhao Feng might become one of the next four great geniuses.The few familiar geniuses of the Zhao family were stunned. Zhao Chi, Zhao Han and Zhao Qin couldn\u2019t hide their shock.\u201cHe won.\u201d Excitement shone within Zhao Yufei eyes.\u201cThere\u2019s such a talented person within the Zhao family. Furthermore, he\u2019s only fourteen years old\u2026 \u201d Qiu Mengyu\u2019s eyes were full of worry and concern.Competition was fierce between the three big families of Sun Feather City and the Qiu family wasn\u2019t on good terms with the Zhao family. And the younger generation would decide their future prospects.\u2026\u2026\u2026.After beating Qiu Changyi, Zhao Feng returned to the Zhao family pavilion.He smiled at Zhao Yufei: \u201cLooks like I didn\u2019t dissapoint you.\u201d\u201cI was joking just then, but I also wanted to know brother Feng\u2019s true strength.\u201d Zhao Yufei said slyly.Suddenly, he felt a killing intent come from his side. Turning around, he saw that Zhao Linlong was sat grimly and looking at him warningly.Zhao Feng shook his head and knew that Zhao Linlong had mistaken him as a competitor for Zhao Yufei. He was too lazy to bother explaining. With his strength, he didn\u2019t fear anyone in the younger generation.The genius summit continued with many talented youths coming onstage.At a certain point.Qiu Mengyu went up to show her skills. She immediately beat many youths of the fourth and fifth rank.Even with Zhao Qin and Zhao Ling\u2019s strength they couldn\u2019t block three moves from her and cultivators of the fifth rank such as Zhao Chi and Zhao Han couldn\u2019t block up to twenty.This made many people secretly click their tongues.\u201cQiu Mengyu is way stronger than Qiu Changyi.\u201d Zhao Feng felt surprised.The feeling that Qiu Mengyu gave off was the \u201cmost beautiful girl of Sun Feather City\u201d, but in terms of strength she was ranked second at the last summit, even one higher than Zhao Linlong.\u201cZhao Linlong, your cultivation is the highest amongst the four great geniuses. Could I have the pleasure to spar with you?\u201d Qiu Mengyu said smiling.\u201cObviously. Since I lost to you last year, there will definitely be a battle this year.\u201d Zhao Linlong stood up slowly and released his sixth rank aura.At this moment, he surveyed the youths in a high noble manner.\u201cBut you\u2019ve just fought just now, so even if I win it won\u2019t be fair.\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s mouth twisted.\u201cNo wonder brother Linlong is the top genius of the Zhao family, then I\u2019ll rest for a while.\u201d Qiu Mengyu smiled and didn\u2019t reject it.\u201cIs there anyone that has the courage to fight me?\u201d Zhao Linlong smiled and scanned the Qiu and Xin family pavilions.\u201cMengyu, let me go and test his skills.\u201d A skinny youth from the Qiu family said lowly to Qiu Mengyu.\u201cQiu Lin, be careful! Don\u2019t fight him head on!\u201d Qiu Mengyu agreed as she recovered her stamina.Ceng!A youth of the fifth rank landed in the middle of the stage.\u201cZhao Linlong, will you fight me?\u201dQiu Lin had intense fighting intent rising in his eyes as a faint deep green glow spread amongst his body, it was obvious that this person was of the peak fifth rank.\u201cHehe, I wonder how many moves you can block.\u201d Zhao Linlong lightly laughed and with a 'shuah\u201d, he left multiple after-images in the dark night.\u201cHigh ranked martial art Shadow Step!\u201d\u201cThis skill can be used to its maximum potential at night!\u201dThe audience exclaimed.At this moment, there were only after-images of Zhao Linlong on the stage. Qiu Lin\u2019s heart jumped, his eyes couldn\u2019t even see how Zhao Linlong moved.\u201cAncient Wind Palm!\u201dHe clenched his teeth and a deep green glow appeared on his palms that swept across a wide area.Beng! Tah! Tah!His area attack swept towards where Zhao Linlong was. However, none of his attacks even landed on Zhao Linlong\u2019s clothes.Shua!Zhao Linlong ghostly figure suddenly disappeared again from his sight. Qiu Lin immediately felt that something was wrong and as if to prove him right, something attacked from behind him.\u201cAncient Wind Reverse!\u201d He exclaimed and threw his palm backwards.Pah!A loud sound sounded throughout the dark night.Qiu Lin\u2019s movement froze and shock filled his face. His arm couldn\u2019t move anymore. The high level of a high ranked skill had been forced to stop in midair.Si!The people watching drew in cold breaths. There was a youth dressed in gold standing behind Qiu Lin with one hand on his shoulder.Qiu Lin only felt cold sweat flow down his back and he felt that the hand on his shoulder was one too heavy.No matter how hard he struggled, he couldn\u2019t move.\u201cShadow Step is a high ranked martial art and being trained to the peak level compensating with Zhao Linlong\u2019s sixth rank of the Martial Path makes him invicible.\u201d Qiu Changyi took a deep breath.Zhao Linlong\u2019s strength was unimaginable.\u201cWho else will spar with me?\u201d Zhao Linlong stood in the middle of the stage, his golden robe flying in the wind making him look like a king.\u201cI will!\u201d A youth of the fifth rank walked out from the Xin family.\u201cI\u2019ll beat you in three moves.\u201d Zhao Linlong laughed and left an after-image in the wind.The two figures clashed and in three moves, the youth of the fifth rank was sent flying with a loud thump.Hu!Zhao Linlong\u2019s faint purple aura rose again.\u201cWho else?\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s eyes scanned across to Qiu Mengyu and Xin Wuheng.Xin Wuheng had his eyes closed and he didn\u2019t respond as if he had no interest to fight.Just as Zhao Linlong was going to challenge him\u2026\u201cI will!\u201dQiu Mengyu was like a goddess that descended onto the middle of the stage.\u201cWhat kind of skill is that\u2026 ?\u201dMany youths stood dazed.Qiu Mengyu\u2019s skill seemed to be surreal and more of a dance.\u201cGood!\u201d Zhao Linlong used his Shadow Step and the after-images once again appeared.Pah! Pah\u2026The two figures occasionally exchanged blows in midair. Every time they clashed, Qiu Mengyu would use Zhao Linlong\u2019s power to help boost her higher.\u201cQiu Mengyu cultivates Twirling Snake Body and it is an unique body strengthening skill, it allows the user to become unusually soft and withstand high damage. Cultivators of the same rank won\u2019t be able to harm her at all\u2026 \u201d Zhao Qin introduced.In terms of how powerful their body strengthening techniques were, Qin Mengyu was even higher than Xin Tong and just lower than Zhao Feng. Furthermore, Qiu Mengyu\u2019s speed skill wasn\u2019t any worse than Qiu Changyi\u2019s and her cultivation was also at the peak fifth rank.With Zhao Linlong using Shadow Step to the extreme, he couldn\u2019t gain an advantage.Thirty moves\u2026 Forty moves\u2026Time slowly passed. Zhao Linlong\u2019s attacks also became more and more fierce.Spatial Cloud Finger!Fifty moves later, Zhao Linlong used his peak ranked martial art.Shua~A thin line of purple light shot through the sky. Qiu Mengyu couldn\u2019t withstand Zhao Linlong\u2019s attacks anymore and she almost coughed out blood after defending ten more moves.\u201cBrother Linlong\u2019s improvements are insane. Your Spatial Cloud Finger and Shadow Step make me look up in awe.\u201d Qiu Mengyu smiled as she gave up.Although she lost, it was expected since Zhao Linlong\u2019s cultivation was too strong. Maybe only Xin Wuheng could give him a fight.After beating Qiu Mengyu, Zhao Linlong\u2019s last oppponent was Xin Wuheng.\u201cWho else will fight me?\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s eyes scanned over the crowds and as it passed Zhao Feng, disdain flashed in his eyes.Finally, Zhao Linlong\u2019s eyes settled on Xin Wuheng. Immediately, every person present looked at Xin Wuheng full of expectation.Xin Wuheng. The king of the summit last year using absolute power to dominate the other three great geniuses.\u201cXin Wuheng! Xin Wuheng!\u201dAs the people screamed his name, Xin Wuheng slowly stood up calmly: \u201cThere\u2019s no use. Same deal as before, ten moves.\u201dHua!The audience erupted in chaos.Ten moves? What did this mean!?Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng looked at the other geniuses.\u201cXin Wuheng has a nickname \u2018Ten moves\u2019\u201d.Zhao Feng took in a deep breath.Ten moves?\u201cUp till now, no one has ever exchanged more than ten moves with him\u2026 Never!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Being the winner of the last summit, Xin Wuheng was famous throughout Sun Feather City.\u201cXin Wuheng I\u2019ve been waiting for this a long time.\u201d Fighting will appeared in Zhao Linlong\u2019s eyes and his sixth rank aura was no longer held back.\u201cZhao Linlong, your energy has been depleted a bit it\u2019s best for you to rest first.\u201d Qiu Mengyu warned helpfully.Zhao Linlong had fought many battles before and used up a lot of stamina especially when fighting Qiu Mengyu. If he faced a normal opponent Zhao Linlong wouldn\u2019t even think about this problem. However, his opponent was \u2018Ten moves\u2019 Xin Wuheng, someone who had thrashed him once already.\u201cBig brother Linlong, you rest first while I test out his skill.\u201d Zhao Ling jumped onto the middle of the stage with his spear.Zhao Ling was ranked seventh in the tournament and he didn\u2019t have any right to attend but Zhao Linlong had given Zhao Feng\u2019s spot to him. Therefore, Zhao Ling was very grateful towards Zhao Linlong and wanted to help him out.\u201cOk, but don\u2019t force yourself.\u201d Zhao Linlong returned to the pavilion and started to recover his energy.With Zhao Ling fighting first, he could at least test a bit of Xin Wuheng\u2019s skills.\u201cXin Wuheng\u2026 take my spear!\u201d Zhao Ling exclaimed as his silver spear flashed through the night.Xin Wuheng stood still with one hand behind his back.Outrageous!Xin Wuheng\u2019s actions meant that he was not putting Zhao Ling in his eyes.Shua!The spear was thrust towards Xin Wuheng\u2019s left shoulder. Xin Wuheng was expressionless as he raised one finger.Dang!The simple finger managed to hit the weakest part of the spear tip and a powerful and chaotic Inner Strength flowed through the spear into Zhao Ling\u2019s body.Zhao Ling immediately felt his blood boil.\u201cLet go!\u201dXin Wuheng swept his hand and unparalleled inner strength hit Zhao Ling making the latter spit out blood.Clang!The spear flew out of Zhao Ling\u2019s hand as he landed on the ground.Zhao Ling was instantly defeated by one finger touch and one palm. This scene made many geniuses\u2019 heart jump, yet it was within expectations. After all, Xin Wuheng came first at the last summit, and even Zhao Linlong could achieve the same results.Inside the Zhao family pavilion.Zhao Feng\u2019s face was solemn, he had seen the whole fight with his left eye. Every move that he used seemed to be simple and casual, yet they would hit Zhao Ling\u2019s critical point as if he had the same ability as his left eye.Furthermore, Xin Wuheng\u2019s attack seemed to follow some kind of law that was too profound for him. It was similar to the attack the mysterious girl had back within the canyon, but the feeling from the mysterious girl was tens of times stronger.\u201cBrother Linlong you recover a bit more, I\u2019ll go and force him to use his full strength.\u201d Zhao Chi\u2019s eyes twinkled as he lept onto the area.\u201cAttack.\u201d Xin Wuheng still stood expressionless.\u201cSky Howling Fist!\u201dZhao Chi immediately used his nearing peak level high ranked skill. At the same time, he used a high ranked speed skill and a high ranked body strengthening technique.Zhao Chi\u2019s strength was the closest to the four great geniuses\u2019 and he didn\u2019t have any flaws in any aspect. Therefore, he was the best one to test Xin Wuheng\u2019s strength.Breaking Wind Finger!Xin Wuheng\u2019s finger sliced through the air like a sharp sword.Ssss!The finger and fist clashed together, but Xin Wuheng\u2019s finger only scrapped past Zhao Chi\u2019s fist.Zhao Chi\u2019s figure immediately fell over while his arm went numb at the same time.\u201cBreaking Wind Finger? It seems to be a middle ranked martial art!\u201d\u201cWait, I\u2019ve also trained Breaking Wind Finger, but it seems different from his.\u201dDiscussion broke out.Zhao Chi took a deep breath and used his high ranked speed skill to escape the danger.Pah! Pah\u2026The two exchanged their finger and fist.One move, two moves, three moves\u2026Xin Wuheng didn\u2019t move a step at all, while Zhao Chi was already sweating and puffing. They had only exchanged three blows in total. Zhao Chi would have to spend energy hundreds of times more than usual. Xin Wuheng\u2019s every move seemed to perfectly counter his.Although they had the same Inner Strength and power level, Xin Wuheng seemed to be in sync with the heavens.When they reached the fifth move, Zhao Chi\u2019s chest, hand and arm had turned sore from blocking.Suddenly, at the sixth move, Xin Wuheng used a middle ranked leg skill and with a \u201cthump\u201d hit Zhao Chi\u2019s arm.\u201cAhhhh\u2026 \u201d Zhao Chi screamed in pain and he landed on the floor sweating coldly.Xin Wuheng only used a middle ranked finger and leg skill to beat Zhao Chi.\u201cIt\u2019s the same as last year, he still only used middle ranked martial arts.\u201d\u201cAll of his skills have at least reached the peak level.\u201dThe middle of the stage.Xin Wuheng stood tall with his hands behind his back calmly as if he had used no energy at all in the previous fight. After Zhao Chi lost, the Qiu family also sent out a few talented disciples to test him out but it was to no avail. Even Qiu Changyi was defeated in seven moves and every time Xin Wuheng attacked, he had only used one hand.Cultivators of the same rank were easily defeated within strain.\u201cHard to believe\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng looked at the battle and soon came up with his analysis.Xin Wuheng had trained five or six middle ranked skills which had all reached the peak level. Some of the moves had even exceeded the original skill in power.At the same time.A tree near the summit. Two figures clothed in silver armor silently stood on a branch, hiding within the night.\u201cTo be able to train so many middle ranked skills to the peak rank\u2026 I can\u2019t believe such a small Sun Feather City has such a talented genius, if he was put in Jun City, he\u2019d be ranked in the top ten.\u201d One of the silver figures said.\u201cYou\u2019ve underestimated him\u2026 although he hasn\u2019t reached the Martial Master yet, he still has the senses of one. I think you understand what this means, don\u2019t you?\u201d The other person said hoarsely.None of the geniuses, guests, and elders sensed these two people.\u2026\u2026..Xin Wuheng stood expressionless in the middle of the stage. At this point, no one dared to challenge him so they turned their eyes towards Zhao Linlong.Zhao Linlong had reached the sixth rank of the Martial Path and he was the only one able counter him. Xin Wuheng\u2019s eyes also turned towards the Zhao family\u2019s pavilion as if he was waiting for something.\u201cAre you ready, Xin Wuheng?\u201d Zhao Linlong stood up, he had reached his peak state, the blood and Inner Strength within him boiled.\u201cI don\u2019t need to prepare.\u201d Although he had just fought many battles, they had expended almost no energy at all since his opponents were defeated almost instantly.\u201cGood!\u201d As soon as he finished his words, Zhao Linlong left a golden after-image and appeared in the middle of the stage.The two geniuses stood facing each other while the spectators watched in anticipation. Even the two silver clad figures watched with interest.\u2018Shadow Step!\u2019Suddenly, Zhao Linlong moved and although most of the younger generation couldn\u2019t see him, they could still hear the 'sha sha\u201d sound coming from him. Most people knew that Zhao Linlong\u2019s high ranked skill, Shadows Step, had reached the peak level and it worked better when used at night.Hu!Xin Wuheng let out a breath and he slowly released the hand behind his back as his expression turned serious. The battles he had fought before were all with one hand, but this time, he was going to use two hands as his opponent had reached the sixth rank.Facing Zhao Linlong\u2019s ghostly figure, Xin Wuheng stood still like a stone statue. Zhao Feng could clearly see that Xin Wuheng\u2019s blood, breathing, and Inner Strength remained calm in his body.\u201cZhao Linlong\u2019s speed skill probably has no effect on him.\u201d He sighed and shook his head.\u201cI don\u2019t believe you!\u201dZhao Ling said coldly: \u201cBrother Linlong\u2019s high ranked speed skill has reached the peak level and his cultivation is also the highest.\u201dHe had developed admiration and trust towards Zhao Linlong. Zhao Feng smiled but he didn\u2019t speak.Shua! Pah!A palm from a golden figure swept towards Xin Wuheng\u2019s back.Too fast!No one understood how Zhao Linlong appeared behind Xin Wuheng. However, at this moment, Xin Wuheng also moved. He moved calmly, just slightly pressing out his chest and the terrifying palm just missed him.\u201cBack Flowing Leg!\u201dWithout even turning, Xin Wuheng unleashed his attack.Peng!Zhao Linlong quickly circulated his Inner Strength and he managed to block Xin Wuheng\u2019s attack. Just as Zhao Feng expected, Zhao Linlong\u2019s speed skill had no effect on Xin Wuheng\u2026Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHow did you know Zhao Linlong\u2019s Shadow Step has no effect on him?\u201d Zhao Yufei asked curiously.On her other side, Zhao Ling said coldly: \u201cHe was just lucky and he said that because he doesn\u2019t like Brother Linlong.\u201dI dislike him?Zhao Feng almost let out his laughter, after all, it was obvious who disliked who.\u201cWhat are you laughing about!? Let\u2019s make a bet then.\u201d Zhao Ling said angrily.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But many people present also knew that Zhao Ling admired Zhao Linlong and this time, Zhao Linlong had given Zhao Feng\u2019s invitation to Zhao Ling. Therefore, Zhao Ling didn\u2019t just admire Zhao Linlong he was also grateful towards him.\u201cZhao Ling, both of you are disciples from the same sect. Why not be more peaceful?\u201d Zhao Qin said.\u201cNo!\u201dZhao Ling\u2019s face turned red then white but his eyes still locked on Zhao Feng: \u201cI bet you that Brother Linlong will win! Do you dare to bet?\u201dObviously, Zhao Ling was absolute faith in Zhao Linlong.\u201cWhy not? I bet that not only will Xin Wuheng win, he\u2019ll also win within twenty moves.\u201d Zhao Feng laughed.What!?The others within the pavilion looked disbelieving at Zhao Feng. From the current situation, there was a five-five win-loss ratio between Zhao Linlong and Xin Wuheng.Where did Zhao Feng\u2019s confidence come from?\u201cGood, good, good! The losing party will have to apologise to the other person.\u201d Fire was almost spewing from Zhao Ling\u2019s eyes.\u201cSure.\u201d On the other hand, Zhao Feng still remained calm.The middle of the stage.Shua!Zhao Linlong once again used his Shadows Step and floated around Xin Wuheng. Moments later, his after-images were destroyed. The golden figure once again appeared and swept towards Xin Wuheng\u2019s lower body with extreme speed.Pah!Xin Wuheng performed a leg skill and knocked back Zhao Linlong\u2019s leg.Blocked again?Zhao Linlong was stunned.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201dZhao Linlong couldn\u2019t believe that anyone could break his Shadows Step, and the opponent\u2019s cultivation level was even lower than his.Once again, Xin Wuheng was expressionless as he stood on the same spot, occasionally moving a few steps to counter Zhao Linlong. Zhao Linlong pushed Shadow Step to the max and not only did his attacks miss Xin Wuheng, Xin Wuheng also counter attacked, making him dodge in fear.If his cultivation wasn\u2019t higher than Xin Wuheng\u2019s, he would\u2019ve been fully suppressed.\u201cZhao Linlong\u2019s speed skill does indeed not have an effect on Xin Wuheng.\u201dZhao Chi and Zhao Han looked incredulously towards Zhao Feng. Zhao Qin and Zhao Yufei once again curiously asked for the reason.\u201cXin Wuheng has trained a hearing skill, which can tell the opponent\u2019s attack route and position by listening to the wind. Adding the fact that Zhao Linlong is the one attacking first, there\u2019s no threat at all.\u201d Zhao Feng explained.The others looked and they saw that Xin Wuheng\u2019s ears were moving. If one didn\u2019t look closely, they wouldn\u2019t realise it at all. But with Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye, it was easy to spot. He found that Xin Wuheng\u2019s ears turned towards Zhao Linlong\u2019s position, which meant that Zhao Linlong\u2019s skill couldn\u2019t confuse Xin Wuheng at all.\u201cHmph! Brother Linlong will still win, but it\u2019s just a matter of time.\u201d Zhao Ling said harshly.At this time, the two exchanged five hard blows. When they finished the fifth move, Xin Wuheng was purely focusing on defense. And on the sixth move, he started to counter attack.Small Cloud Vein Hands!Xin Wuheng once again blocked Zhao Linlong\u2019s hands and at the same time, he used incredible speed and accurately to grab Zhao Linlong\u2019s arm.\u201cOpen!\u201dZhao Linlong immediately released his Inner Strength to shake Xin Wuheng\u2019s hand off. Even when he did that, a bloody claw mark was left on his arm. Every skill that Xin Wuheng learnt had reached the peak level or higher and even with Zhao Linglong\u2019s sixth rank cultivation, he couldn\u2019t block it.\u201cXin Wuheng has reached an extremely high level in terms of control. By using the smallest amount of power, he can deal the most damage. That attack just then had hit one of Zhao Linlong\u2019s acupuncture points\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye saw the whole scene perfectly.Cloud Chess Foot!This time, Xin Wuheng attacked first and he used an unknown step skill. It looked like he was moving backwards, but in reality, it was the opposite. The speed of this skill wasn\u2019t fast, but it seemed extremely queer and every step contained unlimited insight.From Zhao Feng\u2019s point of view, that skill wasn\u2019t a speed skill but a way to play chess.\u201cI\u2019ve never seen such a skill.\u201d The spectators all watching shook their heads.Although it wasn\u2019t fast, the weirdness of it made Zhao Linlong fumble.Breaking Wind Finger!In fear, Zhao Linlong used one of his strongest skills. The powerful finger seemed to go in an impossible route towards Xin Wuheng. The finger skill and speed skill miraculously compensated one another. But at the same time, Zhao Feng felt the \u201cone with the Sky\u201d feeling.\u201cWhat kind of situation is this\u2026 ?\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s pupil\u2019s shrank.Just then, Xin Wuheng\u2019s attack gave him an unknown feeling. The opponent\u2019s hand seemed to contain deep profoundness.Break!Zhao Linlong exclaimed and he used all his power to try to stop the attack.Ta!Xin Wuheng\u2019s figure was knocked back four to five steps. At the same time, Zhao Linlong gave a \u201chmph\u201d as he arm lost all feeling. His right arm fell down powerlessly. Those watching held their breaths.\u201cXin Wuheng\u2019s attack is just too weird.\u201dSome of the people present didn\u2019t understand what had happened, only a small amount of people saw something.Under the tree.\u201cHe\u2019s able to merge a few martial arts together, what kind of genius is he?\u201d One of the silver figures said deeply.\u201cThis seems to contain profoundness from Holy Martial Arts\u2026 He doesn\u2019t seem to be as simple as he looks like\u2026 \u201d The other silver figure said suspiciously.\u2026\u2026How did this happen?Cold sweat flooded from Zhao Linlong\u2019s forehead. From the start of the battle, this was the first time it was obvious that he had the lower hand. The two had only exchanged seven blows so far.Ten moves Xin Wuheng.Could this saying never be broken?Spatial Cloud Finger!Zhao Linlong took a deep breath and finally unleashed his killing move.Howling Tiger Fist!Xin Wuheng remained expressionless and he actually used a middle ranked martial art. At this moment, a howl seemed to come from Xin Wuheng\u2019s fist.Peng!The finger and the fist heavily smashed into each other and a gust of wind swept up everything in a five to six metres radius. Zhao Linlong felt that the opponent\u2019s fist was like a metal ball that was extremely vibrating.All finger skills condensed one\u2019s energy into one point and although the damage dealt was extremely powerful, the dangers were high too. For example, Star Finger was extremely dangerous to train; any minor accident could break Zhao Feng\u2019s finger. Xin Wuheng\u2019s fist contained a chaotic and powerful vibration.Teng!Zhao Linlong had to retreat once again. This was the first time any one of them showed signs of losing. Xin Wuheng immediately closed in on him using fist skills, palm skills, foot skills\u2026 all of them were at the peak level.The seventh move\u2026 The eighth move\u2026 The ninth move\u2026Zhao Linlong was fully suppressed and injuries could be seen on his body. If Zhao Linlong didn\u2019t have the higher cultivation level, the exchanges before would\u2019ve seriously injured him.Finally!It was the tenth move\u2026\u201cThe tenth move!\u201d Everyone held their breaths.\u201cCloud Breaking the Heavens!\u201dZhao Linlong put all his power into his finger. The finger left a purple-azure glow in the sky.So strong!The geniuses watching were shocked.\u201cThe power of this finger is close to my \u201cOne-Line Star Finger\u201d.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s expression slightly moved.\u201cInteresting.\u201d Xin Wuheng faintly smiled and took a light breath.As he did so, a dark grey Inner Strength appeared\u2026 The amount of inner Strength formed surpassed the limit of sixth rankers.How did he do this?\u201cSweeping the Wind and Clouds!\u201dXin Wuheng waved his robe and with the sound of lighting, the stones below him were cut into pieces that then formed a tornado. That casual wave of his robe seemed to disturb the wind. This was the most powerful move Xin Wuheng had used!Boom\u2014\u2014\u2013The two intense moves clashed heavily forming a miniature tornado.That moment.Only two blurry figures were seen and they were covered in dust. The spectators were like wooden chickens.Strong!So strong!Everyone took in cold breaths. Compared to these two, every battle before it was like children\u2019s play.\u201cIt\u2019s hard to believe that these people are only of the sixth rank.\u201d\u201cThe energy at the end was infinitely close to the Martial Master level\u2026 \u201d The important guests had seen more things and understood how terrifying Martial Masters were.Hu~Zhao Linlong\u2019s figure trembled then spat out a mouthful of blood as he fell down.Plop!He used one of his hands to push himself up off the ground, the expressions of fear and unwillingness were still present on his face.Lost!He not only lost, he was defeated in ten moves.Ten moves Xin Wuheng!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euCould this not be broken?\u201cHow could Brother Linlong lose\u2026? It\u2019s only been ten moves\u2026 \u201d Zhao Ling seemed as if he had lost his soul.Zhao Linlong had been his god.\u201cLost in ten moves?\u201d Zhao Feng was surprised himself.He had thought that Zhao Linlong would lose, but not in ten moves.

Once again his assumptions were correct, yet this was not the way he thought that Zhao Linlong would lose\u2026\u201cHow can you be like this Zhao Feng? You shouldn\u2019t say bad things about Brother Linlong.\u201d Zhao Chi\u2019s eyebrows scrunched together.After all, they were all from the same family and Zhao Linlong losing lost face for everyone here.\u201cBig mouther!\u201d Zhao Ling said grimly as if Zhao Linlong had lost because of Zhao Feng\u2019s prediction.You blame me for this?Zhao Feng smiled as he shook his head and said coldly: \u201cDid you just forget our bet where the losing side has to apologise to the other person.\u201dBet? Apologise?Zhao Ling\u2019s face immediately froze and he didn\u2019t speak another word.\u201cI can apologise to you for losing, but I won\u2019t bow down my head towards your shameless act\u2026 \u201d Zhao Ling said trembling with humiliation.\u201cLosing means losing.\u201d Zhao Feng looked in disdain.\u201cYou you\u2026 If you have the skills, why don\u2019t you go challenge Xin Wuheng? If you can block ten moves of his I\u2019ll have nothing to say.\u201d Zhao Ling hatefully said.Because Zhao Linlong had lasted ten moves, he didn\u2019t think that Zhao Feng could do any better.Xin Wuheng\u2019s eyes scanned the younger generation and they finally landed on Zhao Feng: \u201cWould you like to spar with me?\u201dThe other geniuses of the Zhao family were shocked. Even Zhao Ling, who was in the middle of the argument, was stunned.But when he realised that Xin Wuheng was challenging Zhao Feng, his expression of shock changed to one of gloating.\u201cFine! Just as you wished, I\u2019ll let you see how many moves I can block!\u201d Zhao Feng said playfully as he glanced towards Zhao Ling.Although Zhao Ling\u2019s hairs stood up just from Zhao Feng looking at him, he still continued: \u201cIf you can last more than ten moves, I\u2019ll apologise to you truthfully.\u201dThis time, he didn\u2019t say lasting ten moves, but lasting more than ten moves. After all, Xin Wuheng was called \u2018Ten Moves\u2019 Xin Wuheng.\u201cTen moves is too short, at least thirty\u2026 no, fifty moves!\u201d Zhao Feng said casually leaving behind a group of dazed Zhao disciples.Where did his confidence come from?\u201cArrogant!\u201dZhao Linlong, who was returning, managed to hear his words and his expression turned dark. If he, the number one Zhao disciple, was defeated, who else had a chance?On the middle of the stage.Zhao Feng walked slowly towards Xin Wuheng and said: \u201cZhao Feng is here to spar with you.\u201d\u201cMy intuition can\u2019t be wrong, I believe that you\u2019re the only one who can be my true opponent.\u201d Xin Wuheng said calmly.\u201cYou\u2019ve just fought, I\u2019ll give you ten breaths to recover.\u201d Zhao Feng calmly said.Arrogant!Discussion broke out through the audience.\u201cDid he eat the wrong medicine? Does Xin Wuheng need to recover just to fight him?\u201d\u201cJust watch the show\u2026 !\u201dThe other geniuses swore and cursed.\u201cHahaha\u2026\u201dInside the pavilion, tears were coming out from Zhao Ling.Soon, the audience\u2019s attention returned to Xin Wuheng expectantly. After all, Xin Wuheng didn\u2019t even take a breath when fighting Zhao Linlong.\u201cOk.\u201d Xin Wuheng looked deeply at Zhao Feng and sat down cross-legged to recover his energy.What!?Those watching felt shocked. The smile on Zhao Ling\u2019s face froze. Darkness appeared on Zhao Linlong\u2019s face.Why did Xin Wuheng look at Zhao Feng so importantly? Xin Wuheng was obviously going to fight Zhao Feng in his peak state.One breath\u2026 two breaths\u2026 Three breaths\u2026There was dead silence as Xin Wuheng recovered. Finally, ten breaths had passed.Xin Wuheng slowly stood up and it was obvious that he had reached his peak state.\u201cTen breaths! You\u2019re indeed not normal\u2026 \u201d Xin Wuheng\u2019s looked at Zhao Feng deeply.Before, Xin Wuheng had always been in a casual state and he didn\u2019t spend much energy until he fought Zhao Linlong. Since he had fought someone of the higher rank, he had expended more energy. Xin Wuheng understood that he needed ten breaths of time to reach his peak state and coincidentally,, this was the time that Zhao Feng gave him.The precision stunned Xin Wuheng and he couldn\u2019t help but turn serious.\u201cIt\u2019s started.\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t feel nervous at all. Instead, he felt anticipation.Lightly Micro Step!He used his agile speed and he was the first to attack. Lightly Micro Step was a peak high ranked martial art, but when used with Lightly Floating Ferry, it was on par with peak ranked martial arts.Every step that Zhao Feng took was light and agile as if he merged with the wind.Angry Dragon Fists!Zhao Feng didn\u2019t try any flashy tricks and he just hit a single simple punch. He knew that Xin Wuheng\u2019s sense far surpassed those of the same generation, trick moves did nothing to him.Angry Dragon Fists, middle ranked martial art, peak level!Xin Wuheng also performed a skill that had reached the peak level and the two heavily clashed together.Hong!The fists crashing together caused a shockwave. Facing Zhao Feng\u2019s fist, Xin Wuheng only shuddered, but he didn\u2019t move back.Ceng!Zhao Feng used the energy to spin in midair and he attacked once again.Breaking Wind Finger! Small Cloud Acupuncture Point!Xin Wuheng\u2019s eyes were sharp as he used two middle ranked martial arts of the peak level. Zhao Feng still used Angry Dragon Fists to counter him.Tong! Tong\u2026!Taking these blows, Zhao Feng felt his arm turn numb. This was because the two skills Xin Wuheng used compensated one another and when he suddenly changed his skill from Breaking Wind Finger to Small Cloud Acupuncture Point, it caught Zhao Feng off guard. Small Cloud Acupuncture Points specifically hit acupuncture points and it had a certain countering effect towards body strengthening techniques.Angry Dragon Fists!Instead of retreating, Zhao Feng attacked. Xin Wuheng was surprised, he didn\u2019t think that Metal Wall Technique was so strong that his Small Cloud Acupuncture Point almost has no effect at all.Cloud Chess Step!Immediately, Xin Wuheng retreated, making those watching drop their draws in fright. Xin Wuheng had his own reasons as to why he retreated.One, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t get affected by his Small Cloud Hand skill much. Secondly, the aura and power in Zhao Feng\u2019s fist exceeded his expectations.Angry Dragon Fist!Zhao Feng\u2019s fist was like a fire dragon that came at him. The level of this fist had exceeded peak!For the next two moves, Xin Wuheng was fully suppressed. However, it was lucky that he had Cloud Chess Step, which was extremely queer and unpredictable, allowing him to escape quickly.Cloud Chess Step! Lightly Micro Step!One of them was unpredictable, while the other was agile. The two figures exchanged more blows.In terms of speed and agility, Zhao Feng had the upper hand, but Xin Wuheng\u2019s Cloud Chess Step was just too unpredictable as if it wasn\u2019t a skill but a trap.When Xin Wuheng moved forward a few steps, he may have been in a disadvantage. But it also could be a trap for him to sneak attack.The sixth move\u2026 the seventh move\u2026Xin Wuheng started to slowly gain the upper hand. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t use his left eye purposely and because of of this, he got hit a few times. But since his Metal Wall Technique was at the fifth level instead of the peak fourth level, it blocked all the damage.Xin Wuheng also felt his opponent was tricky, his own senses were on par with Martial Masters, but he found out that he couldn\u2019t harm his opponent. One or two times when Xin Wuheng hit Zhao Feng\u2019s body, it was as if he was punching a metal brick.This extremely shocked him, Zhao Feng was indeed tricky. Firstly, Zhao Feng had extremely fast reflexes and battle intuitions. Secondly, his speed and fist defense skills were all powerful.Unless Xin Wuheng hit Zhao Feng\u2019s vitals, Zhao Feng wouldn\u2019t take real damage. Furthermore, Zhao Feng was fast. When he had sparred with Qiu Changyi before, it was already proven that his speed was top tier and not only that, Xin Wuheng felt that Zhao Feng could be even faster.The same reasons made Zhao Feng retreat sometimes as well.The eighth move\u2026 the ninth move\u2026Those watching all stood dazed, from the beginning till now, no one had ever exchanged more than ten blows with Xin Wuheng.Zhao Chi exchanged six blows and Qiu Changyi exchanged seven blows. Even the one with the highest cultivation, Zhao Linlong, was defeated within ten moves.At this moment, Zhao Feng had exchanged nine blows. It was closing in on the tenth move.Xin Wuheng\u2019s eyes were like lightning as they surged out fighting will and he immediately used Cloud Chess Step and a few other skills. The middle ranked skills of the peak level had unimaginable power when used together.Star Finger!Zhao Feng immediately condensed his Inner Strength into his finger and lashed out a few times.Tong! Tong! Tong!Every finger could pierce metal boards. Under Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes, every finger was fast, accurate and powerful.The ninth move\u2026 The tenth move!Apart from the sounds of the two fighting, nothing else could be heard.\u201cSweeping the Cloud and Winds!\u201dXin Wuheng swept his robe and a layer of rock below his feet was sent out in every direction. This was the move that had beaten Zhao Linlong!\u201cThird stance Star Finger!\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s fingertip pierced through the air leaving a azure streak behind as if it was a meteor.\u201cImpossible! How can his Star Finger be at the third level?\u201d Zhao Linlong exclaimed.Suuu\u2014\u2014-Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe sharp finger collided with Xin Wuheng\u2019s robe.Hoooongggggggg\u2014\u2014\u2014-The dust slowly settled.The tenth move.Two figures stood side by side, none of them moving\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In the midst of them, Zhao Linlong and Zhao Ling had extremely ugly expressions on their faces.\u201cTen moves, how could he\u2026 ?\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s face flashed dangerously.From the beginning of the summit till now, only he could withstand ten blows from Xin Wuheng, even though he was defeated on the tenth move.But right now.The one that he looked down on in disdain could also exchange ten moves.Being the top genius of the Zhao sect, how could he let this happen? He was even more scared when he thought about the fact that Zhao Feng could win\u2026\u201cHow could this happen!?\u201d Zhao Ling\u2019s face was sullen.He had bet many times with Zhao Feng, yet he had lost all of them. Zhao Feng\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t any weaker than the god in his heart \u2013 Zhao Linlong.Not any weaker\u2026 better!The dust fell down and the two stood side by side. Both Xin Wuheng and Zhao Feng\u2019s arms were intertwined as they both breathed rapidly.There was a nasty gash on Xin Wuheng\u2019s body which made him curl up his eyebrows in pain. On the other hand, Zhao Feng stood tall, although his shirt was ripped, he wasn\u2019t injured as his Metal Wall Technique had reached the fifth level.In terms of defense, he had Metal Wall Technique, in terms of speed, he had Lightly Floating Ferry, and in terms of offense, he had Star Finger. In every aspect, he was top tier.Ten moves without being defeated!The spectating youths broke out into chaos. Xin Wuheng\u2019s ten moves legend had finally been broken.There was someone who could exchange ten moves with him. This scene was like a heavy hammer smashing on Zhao Linlong and Zhao Ling\u2019s faces.Zhao Chi, Zhao Han and Zhao Qin all had expressions of shock on their faces. Who would have imagined that there was such a black horse within in the Zhao family?No! He was a black horse a long time ago!From the outer disciples contest to the main tournament to the genius summit, Zhao Feng had been creating miracles.\u201cToo strong!\u201d Happiness shone in Zhao Yufei\u2019s eyes.\u201cHmph! Before he said that he could exchange thirty, no\u2026 Fifty moves!\u201d Zhao Ling clenched his teeth and said unwillingly.Although Zhao Feng\u2019s performance was even better than Zhao Linlong\u2019s, he didn\u2019t want to bow down to him!\u201cXin Wuheng, your so called ten moves must have some sort of connection with your Cloud Chess Step. With ten steps setting up a trap and using the smallest amount of energy to deal the most damage possible.\u201d Zhao Feng said smiling.\u201cYou\u2019re right! You lasting ten moves means that your strength is at least on par with mine, or even stronger than mine.\u201d A dangerous light flashed in Xin Wuheng\u2019s eyes.The two were eye to eye, any one of them could attack immediately.\u201cHaha! You\u2019re being too humble unless your cultivation is only at the peak fifth rank.\u201d Zhao Feng said deeply with meaning.Xin Wuheng\u2019s face suddenly became more solemn.Flaming Metal Fist!Zhao Feng attacked while Xin Wuheng was distracted. This time he didn\u2019t use Angry Dragon Fist or even Star Finger, he used the most basic skill \u2013 Flaming Metal Fist!In the short gap, the most simple, faster attack had the best effect. And Flaming Metal Fist was Zhao Feng\u2019s most used skill.But Xin Wuheng wasn\u2019t lacking either, his senses had exceeded the limits of the sixth rank and it was on par with Martial Masters. The instant Zhao Feng condense his Inner Strength and threw out his fist, he had reacted by throwing out his palm.Peng!The collision between the fist and the palm knocked Xin Wuheng backwards. Zhao Feng had trained Metal Wall Technique and so had the advantage on defense and power. The fact that he attacked first also made his punch stronger than Xin Wuheng\u2019s palm.Angry Dragon Fist!Zhao Feng pressed on since he was winning and his Inner Strength started to slowly move to the peak fifth rank.After their first ten moves, Zhao Feng was pushing Xin Wuheng back!The spectators watched in fright. No one could have imagined that there would be another talented youngster who could fight Xin Wuheng.Eleven moves\u2026 Twelve moves\u2026 Thirteen moves\u2026Zhao Feng held control for the first twenty moves. With his left eye, he saw that there was a slight injury inside Xin Wuheng\u2019s body, so he didn\u2019t give him any rest.Xin Wuheng had to retreat to gain some time to heal that slight internal injury, but since Zhao Feng knew that with his left eye, he didn\u2019t give Xin Wuheng any time to recover. The audience was stunned.Inside the Zhao family\u2019s pavilion.Zhao Linlong\u2019s face was extremely ugly and his two fist were tightly clenched. Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation wasn\u2019t even higher than his. Then why could he fight on par with Xin Wuheng?Under the big tree.\u201cZhe zhe, interesting. I can\u2019t believe that a small city like Sun Feather City would have two talented geniuses, the potential of these two could be ranked in the top five of Jun City.\u201d One of the silver figures said.\u201cWe must report this to My Lord in case these two are taken in by other factions\u2026\u201d The other one said cautiously.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.In the middle of the stage, the two figures exchanged blows but no one was able to decide the winner.Twenty moves\u2026 Twenty one moves\u2026 Twenty two moves\u2026After twenty two moves, Xin Wuheng started to recover slowly. His Cloud Chess Step specialised in using slow and steady speed to counter fast speed. Furthermore, he restrained himself from clashing head on with Zhao Feng.Zhao Feng was too strong in terms of pure strength, and once he used Star Finger, the damage dealt was on par with peak sixth rankers. This meant that even Zhao Linlong, who had reached the sixth rank, would be beaten. Therefore, Xin Wuheng had to retreat occasionally and win some time to rest.Thirty moves\u2026 Thirty five moves\u2026Finally, on the thirty fifth move, Xin Wuheng managed to slightly gain the upper hand.The battle became more intense and dangerous. Xin Wuheng would sometimes sneak attack and when he used with Cloud Chess Step, it made the sneak attacks even more unpredictable. But Zhao Feng\u2019s reflexes were unbelievably fast, at the key moment he would see how Xin Wuheng would attack.\u201cHow did he do this? Is he the same as me? Does he have the senses of a Martial Master?\u201d Xin Wuheng thought curiously.Fifty moves\u2026 Sixty moves\u2026No one was winning!Plop!Zhao Ling fell helplessly to the ground, his face was pale. Before, he had bet with Zhao Feng that if he could manage to exchange ten moves, then he would lose.But at that time Zhao Feng had laughed: \u201cTen moves is too little, at least thirty, no, fifty moves\u2026 \u201dAnd at this moment, the two had exchanged over sixty moves with no signs of winning or losing.Sixty moves\u2026 Seventy moves\u2026The two\u2019s offense rate became higher and higher. Finally, they reached eighty to ninety moves.Xin Wuheng took a deep breath and his\u201cone with the heavens\u201d aura became clearer and clearer. This aura was similar to the one from the shy girl at the canyon, yet it was much fainter.Facing this aura Zhao Feng felt like he was an ant. That feeling stopped him from breathing properly.After ninety moves, every attack Xin Wuheng sen out contained deep insights. Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye slowly opened and a faint green azure glow covered his eyeball. Suddenly he went into super-vision mode. Every movement Xin Wuheng made was now tens of times slower.Shua!Inside the pitch black dimension. A hollow figure of Xin Wuheng appeared and every action that he took was replayed back and forth. The hollow figures actions contained deep insights and they were easier to understand compared than the girl\u2019s. Since he had already gained some insights from that Mysterious Wind Palm, Zhao Feng immediately learnt this aura.Open!Zhao Feng suddenly merged his Lightly Floating Ferry, Lightly Micro Step and Flaming Metal Fist into one. An aura similar to Xin Wuheng\u2019s appeared on his body.Pah\u2014-Zhao Feng thrust a palm out at Xin Wuheng.Teng teng teng\u2026..Xin Wuheng\u2019s figure retreated, his face full of shock: \u201cWhat!? His palm\u2026 \u201dHe had a weird feeling that the aura from Zhao Feng\u2019s palm was stolen from him. If that was true, then it would be too terrifying\u2026Xin Wuheng took a deep breath and condensed his Inner Strength. His senses were on par with Martial Masters and his condensing speed and strength far surpassed sixth rankers. This meant that any cultivator under the sixth rank couldn\u2019t beat Xin Wuheng in terms of Inner Strength. This was also why he could beat Zhao Linlong.But he didn\u2019t know that Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye had kept track of all his Inner Strength and blood flow changes.So it\u2019s like this\u2026Zhao Feng soon gained more understanding of that aura.Star Finger!Zhao Feng\u2019s finger stabbed through the air and this time it was even more powerful than before. Star Finger was also about condensing Inner Strength. After he learnt how Xin Wuheng condensed his Inner Strength, Zhao Feng\u2019s Star Finger pushed forwards slightly.\u201cFantastic! Star Finger is closing in on the peak third level.\u201d He really wanted to thank Xin Wuheng.Firstly, he had gained some insight to that mysterious aura. Secondly,he had learnt how to condense Inner Strength more efficiently.Ninety-one moves\u2026 Ninety-two moves\u2026Zhao Feng fought braver and braver.Although Xin Wuheng wasn\u2019t losing, he wasn\u2019t gaining the upper hand either. What made him turn cold was Zhao Feng\u2019s potential, he could feel Zhao Feng getting stronger and stronger.Zhao Feng\u2019s aura and Inner Strength were almost completely similar to his.What kind of person was this guy!?Xin Wuheng couldn\u2019t help but admit that he had met his nemesis. His forte was enlightenment and his opponent\u2019s understanding speed was even faster than his.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNinety-five moves\u2026 Ninety-six moves\u2026They were closing in on one hundred moves. Everyone present held their breaths, their eyes were full of anticipation and excitement for the end result.

In terms of defense, his Metal Wall Technique had reached the fifth level, all attacks under the seventh rank wouldn\u2019t be critical to him. Furthermore, Zhao Feng\u2019s real cultivation was at the sixth rank.Xin Wuheng\u2019s face was like water, but then he slowly put his hands down and his Inner Strength stopped condensing.Hmm?Zhao Feng was slightly surprised.\u201cI admit defeat.\u201d Xin Wuheng said expressionlessly.Admit defeat?Why?Chaos broke throughout the audience, most of them were confused.Xin Wuheng admitted defeat?Even some of the older generation dropped their jaws. No one would have expected Xin Wuheng to admit defeat on the ninety-ninth move.After all from the current situation, Zhao Feng and Xin Wuheng both had a fifty percent chance of winning.\u201cHe\u2026 he beat Xin Wuheng?\u201d Zhao Ling sat helplessly on the ground as he stared dazed into the air.He had finally realised what kind of monster he had aggratated. Zhao Feng had not only surpassed the top genius of the sect, Zhao Linlong, he had even made the top genius of Sun Feather City admit defeat.\u201cNo, you haven\u2019t lost.\u201d Zhao Feng said formally as he looked deeply at Xin Wuheng.His left eye could sense Inner Strength and blood flow and from Xin Wuheng, Zhao Feng could see that his Inner Strength was even stronger than Zhao Linlong\u2019s.Therefore, Xin Wuheng\u2019s cultivation wasn\u2019t at the peak fifth rank. His real cultivation was at the peak sixth rank! Peak sixth rank!He had already crushed all of the geniuses of Sun Feather City under his feet. From the first time he had inspected Xin Wuheng, Zhao Feng had thought: \u201cThis person wasn\u2019t simple\u2026 \u201cObviously, Zhao Feng wouldn\u2019t fear Xin Wuheng with his real cultivation. He didn\u2019t just have strong cultivation himself, he also had the help of his left eye which gave him confidence of not losing.\u201cThere\u2019s no point in continuing our battle.\u201d Xin Wuheng shook his head.He didn\u2019t lose, but the reason he said so was because his real cultivation and killing moves would be seen by others.There was also two more reasons. Firstly, he was older than Zhao Feng by two years and he didn\u2019t want to use this advantage to beat him. Secondly, Xin Wuheng\u2019s aura and techniques had been stolen by Zhao Feng. From Xin Wuheng\u2019s point of view, Zhao Feng was a monster, to show more tricks would only benefit him.\u201cHow about we call it a draw?\u201d Qiu Mengyu said as the host.Draw?Zhao Feng looked towards Xin Wuheng and the two nodded their heads simultaneously.\u201cSure.\u201d Zhao Feng agreed and didn\u2019t forcefully continue their sparring.After all, according to the rules, the battle wasn\u2019t going to last any longer than one hundred moves.\u201cI\u2019ll be waiting for our next battle.\u201d Xin Wuheng said smiling.After he finished his words, he immediately left the summit. This scene confused many people.Was Xin Wuheng leaving halfway through?No one knew that after Xin Wuheng left,he never appeared in Sun Feather City again\u2026His existence slowly faded into nothing. Only till much later did Zhao Feng meet him\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..The summit continued.Xin Wuheng and Zhao Feng\u2019s battle had pushed the summit to a climax. The sparring matches afterwards had all lost their flavour.Now, the four great geniuses finally had their rankings.First place: Zhao Feng and Xin Wuheng.Third place: Zhao Linlong.Fourth place: Qiu Mengyu.At this point, there shouldn\u2019t have been any disagreements, but this summit didn\u2019t didn\u2019t just have one black horse.\u201cThis one Zhao Yufei would like to see your skills.\u201d Zhao Yufei was like a clear lotus, pure and holy. She immediately attracted the attention of many youths.Discussion broke out.Zhao Yufei had reached the fifth rank at such a young age. Her potential was only inferior to Zhao Feng\u2019s, but Zhao Feng understood that all the credit went to his left eye. If he didn\u2019t get this eye, Zhao Yufei would certainly have been most talented in the Zhao family. Even Zhao Linlong didn\u2019t reach this level at the same age.Furthermore, Zhao Yufei came from a branch sect and in terms of resources, shr was far inferior to Zhao Linlong.\u201cI\u2019ll go!\u201d From the Xin family came a youth of the fifth rank.This person was Xin Chen, ranked second in the Xin family, behind Xin Wuheng and in front of Xin Tong. He had only lost to Zhao Linlong and Qiu Mengyu before. In terms of strength, Xin Chen was on par with Zhao Chi, just one step behind the four great geniuses.\u201cButterfly Leaf Palm!\u201dZhao Yufei was as light as the wind and her palm was extremely soft and delicate. As she attacked, she immediately used her high ranked martial art Butterfly Leaf Palm which had almost reached the peak level.Pah! Pah! Pah\u2026The two figures crossed. Zhao Yufei was graceful and delicate. Exchanging up to ten moves, Zhao Yufei had gained the upper hand. In terms of damage, she was only on par with Zhao Chi but her Inner Strength skill was Air Crossing Breathing Technique, which was far superior to Xin Chen\u2019s.Air Crossing Breathing Technique buffed up her speed and offense skills and when the skills were used together, she could easily defeat others of the same rank.Thirty moves later, Zhao Yufei\u2019s power had increased once again. Her palm was both soft yet hard and from the battle, she seemed to gain more insights.\u201cShe\u2019s also trained a high ranked body strengthening technique like Qiu Mengyu.\u201d Xin Tong was shocked.Zhao Yufei\u2019s body strengthening technique wasn\u2019t any weaker than Metal Wall Technique, but it was more suitable for women.\u201cShe had great potential and she has probably hidden her true strength.\u201dZhao Feng suddenly remembered the mysterious one-armed old man. The old man could take out a high ranked skill such as Metal Wall Technique was incredible.Thirty moves later, Zhao Yufei\u2019s attacked wave after wave, and she finally defeated Xin Chen.Zhao Yufei won! There was another black horse this time.Zhao Yufei rested a while and then, she proceeded to challenge Qiu Changyi. Qiu Changyi was one of the four great geniuses, and although he wasn\u2019t going to be number one this year, he was still strong.Flowing Feather Step!Flowing Feather Flying Cloud!Qiu Changyi used his two speed skills, which had both reached the peak level. Only Zhao Feng could catch up to him in terms of speed.\u201cCloud Leaf Ferry!\u201d Zhao Yufei\u2019s skill suddenly changed as she used a skill that had never been seen before.Instantly, her body turned as light as a leaf as she flipped in midair.\u201cCloud Leaf Ferry? What kind of skill is it? It\u2019s not any worse than my Lightly Floating Ferry!\u201d Zhao Feng was shocked.He had finally realised that he was too rushed in exchanging Air Crossing Breathing Technique for Metal Wall Technique. Maybe it was a good deal, but Air Crossing Breathing Technique suited Zhao Yufei perfectly. This skill was even more profound than Air Crossing Breathing Technique.Just as Zhao Feng sighed, the situation changed.Qiu Changyi was losing!In terms of speed, Qiu Changyi didn\u2019t have the advantage since Zhao Yufei had Cloud Leaf Step.Fifty to sixty moves later, Qiu Changyi was defeated. After beating Qiu Changyi, Zhao Yufei would only need to defeat the ones one step higher to become one of the four great geniuses.Finally, the summit was coming to an end.At this time, Zhao Yufei challenged Qiu Mengyu. The battle between the two beautiful girls once again pushed the summit to a climax. Zhao Yufei kept on using Cloud Leaf Ferry to counter Qiu Mengyu.One hundred moves later, the two decided on a draw, once again causing chaos.The four great geniuses had changed to the five great geniuses: Xin Wuheng, Zhao Feng, Zhao Linlong, Qiu Mengyu and Zhao Yufei.The Zhao family had three of the five great geniuses positions giving the Qiu and Xin family a lot of pressure. Qiu Mengyu and Qiu Changyi looked at each other and they saw the worry in in each others eyes. The geniuses of the Zhao family were just too terrifying. Apart from Zhao Linlong, there was also Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei.Zhao Feng\u2019s rise was a miracle, he was in first equal to Xin Wuheng. But Xin Wuheng was older than Zhao Feng, so in terms of talent and strength, Zhao Feng was first.\u201cMengyu!\u201d Behind the stage, an old man in gray robes said.\u201cElder.\u201d Qiu Mengyu said respectfully.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThere\u2019s something I want you to do, this is really important\u2026 \u201d The gray-robed man said softly.\u2026\u2026\u2026.The summit finally ended.The geniuses of the Zhao sect walked out of their pavilion and was beginning to head downhill. Many looked at Zhao Feng with fear and admiration, but there was also jealously and hate.\u201cZhao Feng, don\u2019t think that you\u2019re the best just because you came first. I didn\u2019t even use my true killing move this time.\u201d Zhao Linlong said coldly as he stared at Zhao Feng in an arrogant and confident manner.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Feng connected that claim with the third level of the Martial Arts Library. That day, he had seen Zhao Linlong enter the third level. But at the summit, Zhao Linlong had only used his Spatial Cloud Finger. If he had a real killing move then why didn\u2019t he use it?A smile appeared on Zhao Feng\u2019s lips. The only explanation was that the gains Zhao Linlong had received from the third level of the martial arts library hadn\u2019t been fully digested.Under a certain tree.The two silver clothed figures had seen the entire show.\u201cRemember, the Xin and Zhao family both have one great genius each. Now go and report this to Our Lord\u2026 \u201d One of the silver figures said.Shua!The two silver shadows merged into the night.\u201cWho\u2019s there!?\u201dThe two had only moved a couple hundred metres before an old powerful shout echoed.Teng!A gray robed elder landed on the ground as he eyes stared at the two mysterious people.\u201cHehe, I can\u2019t believe I saw a Martial Master of the seventh rank! Seventeenth, you can go and practise your skills.\u201d One of the silver figures lightly laughed as he left.\u201cHmph! Who dares intrude on the important grounds of the Qiu family!?\u201d The gray robed elders\u2019 eyes were sharp as he sent out a palm.Beng!A green glow sliced through the air, its sound as long as thunder. Under that pressure, the trees and rocks around it were shattered.Transformation Strength, long ranged attacks through the air!This was the symbol of a Martial Master. The power of that palm could easily crush a cultivator of the fourth or fifth rank through the air.\u201cPetty tricks!\u201dThe silver figure that remained behind lifted one hand slowly and pointed one finger at the glow.Shua\u2014-A dark azure Inner Strength was shot out, and like a spear, it pierced through the old man\u2019s attack.The next instant.The two figures exchanged blows as fast as lightning, cultivators of the sixth rank wouldn\u2019t even be able to react.Peng\u2014\u2013A massive hole was appeared where they fought, clouding the area up in dust. The power from these two people were comparable to high tier deadly beasts.Wah!The old man spat out a mouthful of blood, and his face was pale: \u201cWho are you!? Don\u2019t you fear being pursued by the Qiu family?\u201dThe Qiu family was after all one of the three great families of Sun Feather City. It had huge power amongst all the factions within a thousand mile radius of Sun Feather City.\u201cQiu family? A single thought from my master could easily destroy a family clan like yours.\u201d The silver figure snickered as he merged into the darkness as well.\u201cWhere could have those two come from? They seem to be wearing\u2026 Not good! Could they be from the rumoured Guanjun Corps\u2026 ?\u201d The elder took in a cold breath.Guanjun Corps!These words made his heart jump. Sun Feather City was only a small city in the Cloud Country. And the Qiu family was only one of the forces in Sun Feather City.Sun Feather City was one of the 12 small cities under was the Guanlu province\u2019s watch. The Guanjun Corps were the elite troops of Guanlu province. From the beginning of time, the Guanjun Corps were only a legend as it had never been proven that they had ever existed.Apparently, the Guanjun Corps had eighteen guards and each guard had at least reached the Martial Master rank.\u201cIt looks like the Guanjun Corps came to see genius summit, but what\u2019s their reason? Could it be they\u2019re under orders from \u201cthat person\u201d?\u201dThe gray robed elder was uncertain because he understood what the Guanjun Corps stood for. To destroy a family clan such as the Qiu family, it would be as easy as crushing an ant.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..The summit had ended.Youths left in groups of three or five. The 7 from the Zhao family walked down in silence. On the way, Zhao Linlong\u2019s face was extremely dim and no one dared to anger him further.However Zhao Feng didn\u2019t mind as he was focused on another place. His left eye just saw a breath-taking battle miles away. It was the face off between the Guanjun Corps and the elder from the Qiu family.The elder from the Qiu family had reached the seventh rank, all of his moves could attack through the air. The power of those moves could instantly kill hundreds of those below the seventh rank.\u201cIs that the strength of Martial Masters? If they\u2019re so strong at the seventh rank, then I wonder how powerful cultivators of the eighth and ninth rank are\u2026 \u201cJust as they were about to go down the hill, a few disciples of the Qiu family stopped them. The one at the front was a girl around his age.\u201cYoung master Zhao Feng, please stop.\u201d The girl said.Hm?Zhao Feng looked weirdly at those Qiu family disciples.\u201cMy mistress wishes to see you.\u201dYour mistress?Zhao Feng was slightly confused.\u201cMy mistress is the organiser of the Summit \u2013 Qiu Mengyu.\u201d The girl said smiling.Qiu Mengyu?The most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City?The other youths were all shocked as their expressions turned to those of jealously. Some talented youths used thousands of ways just to see her, yet none of them were able to receive a personal invitation from her like Zhao Feng had, what kind of status was this?Qiu Mengyu wasn\u2019t just a genius of the Qiu family or the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City, she was also the next head of the Qiu family as well.\u201cSure.\u201d Zhao Feng thought for a second but then immediately nodded his head.After all, Qiu Mengyu was the organiser of the Summit and he had to save face for her.\u201cPlease follow me.\u201d The servant bowed and led the way.\u201cHmph!\u201d Zhao Yufei mouth twitched as she watched Zhao Feng leave.\u201cCould it be that Qiu Mengyu likes Zhao Feng?\u201d Zhao Chi was slightly surprised.There was some reasoning to it. This time Zhao Feng had shocked everyone as he took first place with Xin Wuheng. What made it even more important was that Zhao Feng was younger, hence his potential was higher.Qiu Mengyu may have seen this potential and tried to invite him to their side.\u201cHe dares!\u201d Zhao Linlong laughed coldly.Everyone knew that the Qiu family and the Zhao family were enemies. If Zhao Feng went over to the Qiu family, it wouldn\u2019t be as simple as betrayal.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Following the servant, Zhao Feng once again returned to the summit.\u201cPlease.\u201d The girl led Zhao Feng to a beautiful, yet simple bamboo house.Zhao Feng soon saw the beautiful figure. Just her figure alone sped people\u2019s heart up. Qiu Mengyu was like a half ripe fruit where as Zhao Yufei was like a bud.Facing the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City Zhao Feng stared dazed for only a second before his heart became as still as water again. Being a youth of fourteen years, this was unseen as most adults would find it hard to resist Qiu Mengyu.Qiu Mengyu sighed within her heart. He was so young and not only was he powerful, his self-restraint was incredible as well.\u201cPlease sit.\u201dQiu Mengyu walked in front of him. At this moment, the two were only inches away.Zhao Feng could clearly feel Qiu Mengyu\u2019s fragrance, breathing and warmth. Normal men would probably find it hard to restrain themselves. Furthermore, Qiu Mengyu personally poured tea for him, every move she made was full of beauty.Zhao Feng casually took the cup and as expected, he touched Qiu Mengyu\u2019s finger. It was a dream for other youths to stand next this girl, but Zhao Feng remained expressionless.Truthfully, if he was to size up Qiu Mengyu, distance didn\u2019t really matter for him as he could check her out with his left eye from miles away.If Zhao Feng was willing, he could half see-through stuff. Obviously, Qiu Mengyu didn\u2019t know this or else she\u2019d be trying to avoid him, instead of inviting him here.\u201cYoung master Zhao Feng\u2019s fame will soon spread in Sun Feather City\u2026 \u201d Qiu Mengyu\u2019s voice was as soft as rain.Zhao Feng asked her a few questions politely, but he thought in his heart: why did Qiu Mengyu want to see him?He was young, so he didn\u2019t know much about the differences between boys and girls. Therefore, he didn\u2019t fall for Qiu Mengyu\u2019s smile.His left eye also made Zhao Feng calm and he was able to restrain himself from desires. Their talk only consisted of Qiu Mengyu asking and Zhao Feng answering.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng acted like a wood head. Qiu Mengyu couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether or not she just wasn\u2019t appealing enough or his age was too small. Zhao Feng\u2019s performance made her well planned beauty trick fail.\u201cYoung master Zhao, do you have the intention to enter our Qiu family? The Qiu family can satisfy all your desires including martial arts, silver, women\u2026 \u201d As she said this Qiu Mengyu\u2019s godly figure was almost pressing onto Zhao Feng.Zhao Feng immediately turned alert and put a distance between them. Thinking for awhile, he finally realised Qiu Mengyu\u2019s intentions. Qiu Mengyu\u2019s face turned red. She felt helpless against a youth who didn\u2019t know much about sex.\u201cThanks for your good intentions, but my path isn\u2019t limited to just Sun Feather City.\u201d Zhao Feng said deeply as he slowly rose up.His path wasn\u2019t limited to Sun Feather City! Qiu Mengyu\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but tremble as she watched the youth leave. In her sight, the youth seemed to become more attractive.\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

From the surface, Zhao Feng seemed like a young fourteen year old youth but the coldness, calmness and perception in his eyes didn\u2019t seem like human. Even Zhao Feng himself didn\u2019t realise that his bloodline as well as attitude had changed with the eye merging\u2026Teng!A scholarly clothed youth landed next to Qiu Mengyu, it was Qiu Changyi!\u201cMengyu, did that kid leave so fast? Did the most beautiful girl of Sun Feather City fail?\u201d Qiu Changyi was slightly surprised.\u201cI failed\u2026 He doesn\u2019t seem like a normal youth.\u201d Qiu Mengyu shook her head.Suddenly an old voice appeared: \u201cDon\u2019t worry Mengyu, I never expected it to work anyway.\u201dA grey robed elder appeared behind the two.\u201cElder.\u201d The two immediately greeted the old man.The summit obviously had an elder overseeing the event and that elder was this old man. Not long ago, he had fought with the mysterious Guanjun Corps therefore his face was slightly pale.\u201cMengyu you\u2019ve already succeeded at delaying him for half the time it takes for an incense stick to burn. The second resolution has already been set up.\u201d Killing intent shone within the elder\u2019s eyes.\u201cAre you really going to do this?\u201d Unwillingness appeared on Qiu Mengyu\u2019s face.\u201cHis potential is just too great. Once the Zhao family becomes too strong, the Qiu family will be destroyed.\u201d The old man said.\u201cBut Elder! If Zhao Feng dies, the Zhao family will link it to the Qiu family.\u201d Qiu Chanyi was somewhat hesitantly.\u201cHehe, dead geniuses have no value at all. Furthermore, he\u2019s only from a branch sect and our plan is perfect. Zhao Feng will not die near the Qiu family\u2019s grounds\u2026 \u201d A mysterious smile appeared on the grey robed elder\u2019s face.Shua!As he said that his figure disappeared into the darkness, his speed was even two times faster than Qiu Changyi\u2019s.\u201cSo unfortunate.\u201d Qiu Mengyu and Qiu Changyi looked at each with sympathy within their eyes.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026Zhao Feng walked by himself down the hill again. At this time, the summit had ended so there weren\u2019t that many people on the way. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know why, but he had an uneasy feeling, as if he was being watched. A killing intent made his left eye twitch.Hm?Zhao Feng silently opened his left eye. Suddenly, a faint azure light appeared in his eye. In the darkness, it was even more beautiful. Zhao Feng went into enhanced-vision mode again. The pitch black night was as clear as day to him. He could see everything in a ten mile radius, if it was daytime, the distance would have doubled.The feeling of these super senses gave him confidence and calmness.Shua!Under his scan, Zhao Feng suddenly saw a figure on a tree a few hundred feet away. That figure wore a grey robe and blended in well with the tree, normal people wouldn\u2019t sense him at all. However, Zhao Feng\u2019s eye saw clearly who the person was.It\u2019s him!Zhao Feng\u2019s heart jumped! He had seen this grey robed elder before, it was this person who fought the mysterious silver figure before.\u201cNot good! This person\u2019s probably an elder of the Qiu family and he probably wants to kill me!\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s mind raced.His performance was just too outstanding, therefore even the high levels of the Qiu family had started to notice him.\u201cLuckily, I hid my real cultivation.\u201dZhao Feng pretended he saw nothing at all and he used normal speed to return to the Zhao family. He was now getting closer and closer to the Zhao families territory. Zhao Feng felt weird, why wasn\u2019t the opponent attacking?He opened his super vision once again and surveyed his surroundings. There was a remote area six or seven miles into the Zhao sect\u2019s territory. Zhao Feng knew that this was the last and only place they would attack.Why would they attack near the Zhao families territory?Zhao Feng\u2019s mind spun and he immediately knew the answer.If Zhao Feng died near the summit, this would obviously cause the suspicions of the Zhao family and they would put the blame on the Qiu family as the summit was within the the Qiu families\u2019 territory. The Qiu families\u2019 plan was to let Zhao Feng die in the Zhao sect\u2019s own territory. This way the Zhao sect would have no proof and evidence to blame others.What a smart plan!Zhao Feng immediately circulated his Inner Strength and sprinted towards the front gate of the Zhao family.\u201cI just need to reach the grounds near the Zhao family. There\u2019ll be many guards there and the Qiu family won\u2019t have the guts to kill me then\u2026 \u201dZhao Feng came to a decision. Thinking up to here, his speed became even faster.\u201cThis brat hid his real cultivation! His speed is even faster than Changyi\u2019s\u2026 \u201d The grey robed elders\u2019 speed also increased.Six miles\u2026 Five miles\u2026 four miles\u2026Zhao Feng was getting closer and closer to the front gate.Sou Sou Sou\u2014-Suddenly, two figures came out from the front gate of the Zhao sect. From what they were wearing, they seemed to be from the Zhao sect. For Zhao Feng, this was good news as the person behind would have to be wary of these two. His left eye scanned over the two\u2019s faces. The two were both middle aged and their cultivation had both reached the sixth rank.One of the faces was extremely familiar.\u201cIt\u2019s him! Zhao Tianjian\u2026 \u201dZhao Feng was surprised. One of the two cultivators of the sixth rank was Zhao Yijian\u2019s father, Zhao Tianjian! Zhao Tianjian and the other person casually came towards Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng instantly felt uneasy. If it was anyone else that came, then he wouldn\u2019t be suspicious, but if one of them was Zhao Tianjian, this would immediately put him on alert.\u201cStop him, then kill him as fast as possible!\u201d Zhao Tianjian said to the other sixth rank warrior.As it was night and there was still quite a distance between the two, Zhao Tianjian didn\u2019t know that Zhao Feng had already seen his face.Sou!The elder behind suddenly increased speed as the two groups came from either side. Zhao Feng felt the danger emitting from the elder, he wasn\u2019t scared of Zhao Tianjian and co. but he was extremely wary of the Qiu families\u2019 elder. The elder of the Qiu family had reached the seventh rank, he wasn\u2019t a Martial Artist anymore, he was a Martial Master!Lightly Floating Ferry!Zhao Feng figure suddenly increased.What speed!Zhao Tianjian and co.\u2019s expression changed as the two split up in two different directions blocking off Zhao Feng\u2019s path. If they couldn\u2019t quickly kill Zhao Feng, their identities would be found out.If the fish didn\u2019t die, it would be because the net had broken! (Meaning only one of them must die)Kill!The two people from the Zhao family attacked Zhao Feng at the same time.Cold Flowing Sword!Zhao Tianjian\u2019s blade immediately turned into a cold light. Zhao Feng obviously knew how strong Cold Flowing Sword was as he had fought with Zhao Yijian before who had also used this skill. But this time, Zhao Tianjian\u2019s Cold Flowing Sword had reached the peak level and with his cultivation in the late stages of the sixth rank, the attack was even more deadly.Emperor Wind Fist!From the side came a deep whistling sound, the other middle aged man had attacked at the same time. Two peak sixth ranks fighting a fifth rank, this was obviously unfair. Furthermore, there was still the killing move of the Qiu family elder! Once an accident happened, the elder would be able to settle it with his seventh rank strength.Lightly Floating Ferry! Lightly Micro Step!Zhao Feng circulated these two skills to its max and he just barely managed to dodge the attacks.First Stance of Star Finger!Zhao Feng\u2019s aura suddenly rose to the sixth rank.Shua!\u2014\u2014An azure light was like a meteor as it flashed by and hit Zhao Tianjian\u2019s sword.Dang~Zhao Tianjian only felt his arm turn numb and his blade snapped in half. At the same time, a chaotic Inner Strength smashed into his body.Wah!Zhao Tianjian immediately coughed out a mouthful of blood and his expression turned nasty: \u201cStar Finger\u2026 How could you have learnt that? And your cultivation\u2026 \u201dStar Finger!This was the best of the best peak ranked martial arts. Once it was used, nothing could withstand it. Even Zhao Tianjian of the peak sixth rank had received internal injuries from blocking this skill head on.\u201cDie!\u201dZhao Feng once again attacked and although these moves wasn\u2019t his killing move Star Finger it still added injuries to Zhao Tianjian.Emperor Wind Fist!The other sixth rank sneaked up from behind to save Zhao Tianjian. The two never imagined that Zhao Feng\u2019s real cultivation was at the sixth rank and that he had learnt Star Finger. If Zhao Feng wanted to kill Zhao Tianjian right now, he would have to take the attack from behind head on.Die!Zhao Feng didn\u2019t care about the attack from behind at all and he used Star Finger once again. The faint azure light was beautiful in the night.Pu!The finger hit his target.\u201cAh\u2026 \u201d Zhao Tianjian\u2019s body froze as a hole appeared in his chest.Plop!The life of a cultivator of the sixth rank ended there. This was due to the fact that Star Finger was just too strong and Zhao Feng\u2019s Metal Wall Technique added more power to this skill.Emperor Wind Fist!At the same time, the full out attack from other sixth rank warrior had reached his body.Pah!Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t dodge at all, the best he could do was shift his body so his vitals weren\u2019t hit.\u201cBam!\u201dAs the fist hit Zhao Feng, the middle aged man\u2019s expression turned into one of relief and joy. The Qiu family elder far away had a smile on his face too, it was a worthy trade if they killed Zhao Feng in exchange for Zhao Tianjian.\u201cMetal Wall Rebound!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng exclaimed as he gathered all his Inner Strength and put it into Metal Wall Technique. His whole body turned into a metal wall as it rebounded the attack.Craaaack!Blood leaked from the middle aged man\u2019s mouth as he felt a powerful vibration travel through his arm.Teng! Teng!

Metal Wall Technique was pretty popular amongst the body strengthening techniques, most cultivators could only train it to the fourth level.However, Zhao Feng had trained it to the fifth level. The fifth level of Metal Wall Technique meant that not only did his defense greatly increase, it also had a certain rebound effect. If this was in a brawl, Zhao Feng only needed to use this move and he could instantly rebound the attacks from cultivators of the fourth and fifth rank and seriously injure them.The middle aged man never thought that Zhao Feng had this move. Zhao Feng\u2019s strong body had shook off that attack and he had received light injuries from the rebound.Star Finger!Zhao Feng used his strongest move as the opponent was dazed.Shua\u2014-A faint green light came and pierced into the middle aged man\u2019s body.Plop!Another cultivator of the sixth rank had his life ended. Disbelief and shock was on the grey robed elder\u2019s face as he watched the scene from far way.Lightly Floating Ferry!Zhao Feng didn\u2019t hesitate at all as he used his speed skill to sprint towards the front gate of the Zhao family. At this moment, there was only three miles left and with his speed, he only needed a short while.\u201cBrat! Where are you running\u2026 ?\u201d The grey robed elder exclaimed as he turned into a blur, chasing after him at an even higher speed.Although Zhao Feng\u2019s speed skill was extremely profound, the person pursuing him was a Martial Master. The Martial Path was split into nine ranks with each three ranks having a big difference. Cultivators of the fourth to sixth rank were named Martial Artists and the cultivators of the seventh to ninth rank were known as Martial Masters.The difference between the two was like a cliff.Zhao Feng circulated Lightly Floating Ferry to the maximum, but he still felt the wind behind him getting closer and closer.So fast!Zhao Feng estimated that the opponent\u2019s speed was at least double his. Fifteen breaths later, the grey robed elder was within ten yards of Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng took a deep breath and pushed Air Crossing Breathing Technique to the limit, under that situation, Zhao Feng\u2019s speed was even ten to twenty percent faster than usual. His Lightly Floating Ferry just needed a bit more perfection to reach the high level.\u201cHe must be eliminated!\u201d The elder\u2019s heart shook as he saw Zhao Feng\u2019s potential.If a genius like him lived, he would be able to become one of the strongest people in Sun Feather City within ten years.Close! It\u2019s getting close\u2026There was only two miles between Zhao Feng and the gate now. But at the same time, the grey robed elder was getting closer too.\u201cDie!\u201dThe grey robed elder sent out a palm that glowed gold. As he did so, a wave of air attacked Zhao Feng. Being a Martial Master, the grey robed elder didn\u2019t need to fight in close combat as he could attack through the air.Puuu!The wave of air hit Zhao Feng first.\u201cLightly Floating Spatial Ferry!\u201d Zhao Feng suddenly jumped.Teng!He jumped again and used the wave of air as a booster.\u201cWhat!?\u201dThe grey robed elders\u2019 attack missed.Run!Zhao Feng started to scream for help as he ran, hoping to attract attention.\u201cDie! Double jumping\u2026 I can do it too!\u201d The grey robed elder double jumped in midair too.Being one of the elders of the Qiu family, he naturally had access to peak rank speed skills and he had trained it to the high level.Teng! Teng!Zhao Feng obviously wasn\u2019t someone who would wait for his death and at the important moment, he managed to triple jump. But this way, the two became closer. The two figures landed on the ground at almost the same time.\u201cCloud Slash Palm!\u201dThe grey robed elder attacked again, the airwave alone could instantly kill cultivators of the fifth rank.Poof!Zhao Feng used Metal Wall Technique to block immediately but even then, he was injured. If it was someone else of the sixth rank, they probably would\u2019ve been instantly crippled. The attacks through the air of Martial Masters of the seventh rank were slightly weakened as the power had left the body. But if one reached the eighth rank, the attack through the air would be be on par with the damage they dealt at close combat. According to the legends, if one reached the ninth rank the attacks through the air would be even stronger than body to body attacks.It was lucky that the elder was only of the seventh rank and not the eighth. After Zhao Feng took another few hits head on, he used the aftershock to push him forward again.\u201cCloud Opening the Mountains!\u201dAt this instant, the grey robed old man sent a devastating powerful palm at Zhao Feng. This attack was undodgeable. If it was someone else of the sixth rank within Sun Feather City, they would lose at least half their life if not all. Under the pressure, Zhao Feng\u2019s eye was pushed to its limits. In his eye, the movement of the elder became slower and slower, even the changes in his body were seen by Zhao Feng.Even the small flaws of the elder were seen by him.Mysterious Wind Palm!At the critical moment, Zhao Feng used the weird move.Hu~Zhao Feng suddenly gave off the One with the Heavens aura. At that moment, the scene of the girl using that move appeared in the pitch black dimension of his left eye again. The fact that he had copied Xin Wuheng\u2019s One with the Heavens aura made Zhao Feng gain more insights into the palm.What kind of move is this?The grey robed elder felt his opponent\u2019s palm had a natural yet ungraspable feeling.Mysterious Wind Palm!Zhao Feng lept into the air and an azure glow formed within his palm as he attacked. The palm seemed to have originated from nature itself.Cloud Opening the Mountains!The two heavily collided.Peng!A massive hole was left where the two moves clashed. Zhao Feng felt a chaotic and surprisingly powerful Inner Strength rush into his body, even the fifth level of Metal Wall Technique wasn\u2019t able to stop it. The true difference between them was cultivation level.Wah!Zhao Feng spat out a mouthful of blood, but still used the remaining energy to push him further out.\u201cHow\u2026 ?\u201dThe elder\u2019s face turned white as blood leaked out of his mouth. If there was a spectator, they would\u2019ve been stunned because a Martial Master of the seventh rank had been injured by a sixth rank youth.In terms of power, Zhao Feng\u2019s palm just then wouldn\u2019t have surpassed Star Finger, but the profoundness of this skill had exceeded the limits of peak ranked martial arts. There was a certain suppressant between martial arts. Above peak ranked martial arts were Holy martial arts, the difference between the two was like the sky and ground.Zhao Feng\u2019s Mysterious Wind Palm had surpassed the elder\u2019s attack in terms of profoundness. This was one of the advantages he had. Another one was that Zhao Feng\u2019s Metal Wall Technique had reached the fifth level, making his power even stronger than the elder\u2019s. The last advantage Zhao Feng had was that the elder had been injured when fighting the silver figure and Zhao Feng had seen the injuries the elder had sustained and hit those points exactly.Therefore, the elder had been injured and he didn\u2019t even rest or heal himself. So there was the risk of him dying.\u201cHahaha\u2026 we\u2019ll meet later!\u201d Zhao Feng laughed as he sprinted towards the front gate.The pale faced elder could only clench his teeth and stare at Zhao Feng running away. Zhao Feng got closer and closer to the front gate and at this moment, he saw the grey robed old man merge back into the night.Hu~Zhao Feng let out a breath then took some medicine pills.In his room.Zhao Feng sat closed legged trying his best to recover.\u201cWithout ten to fifteen days of recovery, I can\u2019t fully heal. But the elder from the Qiu family is even more injured\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng mumbled to himself, his face full of thrill.He had the right to be proud to escape from a Martial Master and injuring him, but Zhao Feng knew that this was only because the opponent had already been injured and his Mysterious Wind Palm had hit the critical point.For the next few days.Zhao Feng remained at home, concentrating on healing himself. While he was recovering, he couldn\u2019t train most of his skills such as Metal Wall Technique and Star Finger, so he used the time to try and gain insights from two different scenes.The scenes belonged to the girl from the canyon and the other from Xin Wuheng. Xin Wuheng\u2019s move was simpler to understand and within two days, Zhao Feng had learnt it. Then, Zhao Feng started to gain insights in Mysterious Wind Palm and Star Finger. Although Mysterious Wind Palm was only one move, the difficulty of it was insane. Therefore, the progress was slow.Zhao Feng had to concentrate more on gaining insights in Star Finger and compared with Mysterious Wind Palm, it was easier. The fact that he had learnt Xin Wuheng\u2019s move made it even easier for him to understand. Slowly but steadily, Zhao Feng\u2019s enlightenment of Star Finger had reached the Fourth level.For the first few days, he couldn\u2019t train properly as he was still injured, but when he had seventy to eighty percent recovered, Zhao Feng started cultivate once again.Shua! Shua\u2026Zhao Feng\u2019s fingertip pierced time and time again, and his Inner Strength became sharper and sharper. Since the time he had learnt Xin Wuheng\u2019s move, Zhao Feng\u2019s Star Finger had increased at a ridiculous rate.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euShooo\u2014-Suddenly, a faint azure light shot out from Zhao Feng\u2019s fingertip.Pew!A small hole appeared on the wall.Spatial Star Finger had been achieved!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 58": "Chapter 58Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 58 \u2013 Confinement OrderSpatial Star Finger!Happiness surged within Zhao Feng\u2019s heart. At this moment, if there was someone else present, they would have been shocked: Could this youth have reached the seventh rank at such a young age?Everyone knew that only Martial Masters could release their Inner Strength into the air. (Attacking through the air) This was a level that most cultivators dreamed of.But, Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t a Martial Master, his cultivation had reached the sixth rank not long ago. This was all due to Star Finger reaching the fourth level.At the fourth level, one could condense their Inner Strength and shoot it through the air. Obviously, this skill was way harder to train that others, even Elder Zhao who guarded the martial arts library, had only reached the third level back then.Elder Zhao had presumed that this skill might\u2019ve been a half-step Holy martial art. Even geniuses needed to be at least the seventh rank to train this skill to the fourth level. Therefore, it was unheard of for cultivators of the sixth rank to attack through the air.Break!A green glow flashed through the air and hit the window two metres away.Psh!A screeching sound sounded as the window broke. As Star Finger had just reached the fourth level, the damage dealt by it wasn\u2019t high, it was only roughly half of close combat power. But even so, the finger could still instant kill normal Martial Artists.For the next two days, Zhao Feng consolidated his Star Finger. Inside his mind, he still tried to gain insights into that One with the Heavens feeling.Pu! Pu! Poo\u2026Zhao Feng somehow managed to stab out consecutive fingers. The damage dealt by them was sixty to seventy percent of his close combat attacks, but once the range surpassed two metres, the power would significantly decrease.If Zhao Feng was killing, he could kill almost any cultivator under the seventh rank with just one finger. Zhao Feng was confident that he wouldn\u2019t be so ruffled by fighting the Qiu family elder again.Hu~Zhao Feng walked out of the room and smelt the refreshing air.\u201cBrother Feng\u2019s been in secluded meditation for a long time, so there must have been some kind of breakthrough right?\u201d Zhao Yufei said smiling as she walked over.\u201cI had some insights after the summit.\u201d Zhao Feng replied.The main reason he didn\u2019t leave his room was because he was recovering as he had been seriously injured that day. Hearing this, Zhao Yufei immediately became excited. Being neighbours, the two often met so a little sparring couldn\u2019t be avoided.Zhao Feng still suppressed his cultivation to the fifth rank, but he often released the One with the Heavens aura when sparring with Zhao Yufei. Zhao Yufei was increasing by leaps and bounds and she had even learnt a peak ranked martial art.Spiritual Wind Slice!A purple glow appeared on her jade like fingers as she condensed her Inner Strength onto her palm. Every slice she made with it could cut through rock.\u201cSpiritual Wind Slice? When did Zhao Yufei have such a skill?\u201d Zhao Feng exclaimed.The profoundness of Spiritual Wind Slice was almost on par with his Star Finger. The advantage of Spiritual Wind Slice was that it was fast and sharp, whereas Star Finger strove for pure power.\u201cHaha, I\u2019ve become one of the four great geniuses, so this was the reward the high level gave me.\u201d Zhao Yufei said happily.What?It looked like quite a few important things happened while he was recovering.\u201cDid Brother Feng not receive any prize?\u201d This time it was Zhao Yufei\u2019s turn to feel weird.\u201cNope!\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head.Logically, he should have gotten an even better prize than Zhao Yufei because his ranking was even higher.\u201cYou should go ask one of the elders.\u201d Zhao Yufei said.While sparring with Zhao Yufei, Zhao Feng found out another shocking news. The one who tied first with him at the summit, \u201cXin Wuheng\u201d, had vanished into thin air.\u201cIt\u2019s already been ten days since the end of the summit. Why would he disappear without any trace?\u201d Zhao Feng felt that this wasn\u2019t as simple as it looked.Could Xin Wuheng be killed\u2026 ?Zhao Feng shook his head. He wasn\u2019t close to Xin Wuheng or anything.After sparring, the two separated.\u201cSince Zhao Yufei got a prize I should get one too\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng thought confidently.After all he had tied for first. But now with Xun Wuheng gone, he was first!Soon, he arrived at the Martial Arts Library where he saw Elder Zhao.\u201cElder Zhao!\u201d Zhao Feng greeted the elder overseeing the library.\u201cYou\u2019ve come to me for the rewards, right?\u201d Exhaustion appeared on his face.\u201cYes, that\u2019s correct.\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t hide his intentions.The elder looked at him with admiration and care: \u201cYou did better than I expected at the summit\u2026 \u201d\u201cYou\u2019re flattering me! If I didn\u2019t have the help of Elder Zhao, then I wouldn\u2019t have such achievements today.\u201d Zhao Feng humbly said.\u201cNot arrogant at all, you\u2019re indeed a shapeable genius\u2026 Just a few days ago, I asked the head of the family to let you in the third floor of the Martial Arts Library.\u201dThird floor of the Martial Arts Library! Zhao Feng\u2019s heart sped up.At the Zhao sect, the third floor was only a legend. It had never been opened before.The second floor already contained peak ranked martial arts. Then what would the third floor hold?The arrogance Zhao Linlong had shown must have had some backing to it. Eight or nine out of ten was that it was connected with the third floor.\u201cAlthough there aren\u2019t any Holy martial arts on the third floor, there are still some partial Holy martial arts for geniuses to gain insight from. Those whose cultivation aren\u2019t high enough wouldn\u2019t gain anything from entering anyway, therefore, the third floor closed. Only Zhao Linlong was able to enter, even though his cultivation was under the seventh rank.\u201d Elder Zhao explained.Understanding was shown on Zhao Feng\u2019s face. Zhao Linlong had come first at the family sparring contest and being the adopted son of the head of the sect, he was able to enter the third floor.\u201cThanks you elder for giving me this chance.\u201d Zhao Feng was full of gratitude.\u201cUnfortunately, the head of the sect actually rejected this.\u201d Elder Zhao sighed as he shook his head.Rejected?Coldness and unfairness crept into Zhao Feng\u2019s heart. Zhao Linlong was only first in the Zhao sect, but he had come first in the whole of Sun Feather City.Could it be because he was just a branch disciple, while Zhao Linlong was the head of the sect\u2019s step son?\u201cWhy did the head of the sect not agree?\u201d Zhao Feng took a deep breath, he wanted to hear the sect leader\u2019s reasons.\u201cDid you meet with Qiu Mengyu after the summit?\u201d Elder Zhao asked deeply.\u201cThat\u2019s true.\u201d Zhao Feng replied, full of understanding.The Qiu family and the Zhao family were enemies and the fact that he had accepted Qiu Mengyu\u2019s invitation easily raised suspicions.\u201cTwo corpses were found and after examination, we found that they died to a skill similar to Star Finger.\u201d Elder Zhao\u2019s eyes stared at him.Star Finger?Zhao Feng pretended to be surprised: \u201cDoes the sect think that I killed them?\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe it, how could you kill the two of them with only the fifth rank?\u201d The elder shook his head.Indeed.The two had both reached the peak of the sixth rank and they were of the older generation, so they had access to high tier martial arts.If someone was logical and not retarded, they would know that the killer wouldn\u2019t be Zhao Feng.Obviously, this was according to logic\u2026Elder Zhao probably wouldn\u2019t have dreamed that the killer was right in front of him.\u201cSomeone reported that you privately went to Qiu Mengyu\u2019s place and Zhao Tianjian and co. died near the sects\u2019 territory. Many people of high positions are suspicious of you teaming up with the Qiu family to kill the two.\u201d His voice became solemn.Firstly, it was true that Zhao Feng had met up with Qiu Mengyu. Secondly, Zhao Tianjian had enmities with Zhao Feng and he died precisely on the night that Zhao Feng returned.This was enough reason to raise suspicions. All in all, he was just a branch disciples. It didn\u2019t matter whether or not there was evidence, the sect leader would use this as reasoning to not let him in the third floor.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cWho\u2019s the reporter?\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s eye twitched as he thought.That night there was only Zhao Linlong, Zhao Yufei, Zhao Han etc with him. The one closest with the head of the sect was undoubtedly Zhao Linlong.\u201cThe high level have already ordered that before the truth has been revealed, you are not to leave the grounds of the Zhao sect.\u201d The elder sighed helplessly.What!?Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes turned sharp: \u201cIs this a confinement order?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He obviously wasn\u2019t a retard, the people that had teamed up with the Qiu family were the two that died! That night when he returned, it was obviously planned. Qiu Mengyu invited him over to get them time to set up this plan. Once the plan was successful and Zhao Feng died near their own sect, how would the Zhao family react? Furthermore, a dead genius from the branch sect wouldn\u2019t motivate the high level much to find the killer.\u201cRelax!\u201dElder Zhao said deeply: \u201cAs long as I\u2019m alive, they have no evidence to do anything to you. I\u2019ll make sure to find the truth!\u201d\u201cThank you for you care, elder.\u201d Zhao Feng was full of respect and gratitude.Truthfully, if Zhao Feng didn\u2019t have Elder Zhao defending him, it wouldn\u2019t be as simple as a confinement order.Confinement order?I don\u2019t have the plan to go anywhere! So what can you do?Zhao Feng laughed coldly within his heart and he couldn\u2019t be bothered to explain.He was just a branch disciple, the high level of the sect didn\u2019t trust him. If he was to explain the truth, his hidden strength and cultivation would cause another whole range of problems.Returning back to his house.Zhao Feng calmly sat down and cultivated, now his injuries were almost fully healed. With his sixth rank cultivation, his strength was top tier in Sun Feather City, the only ones that could threaten him were Martial Masters. Apart from that, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t put anyone else in his eyes.\u201cI will leave the Zhao family, leave Sun Feather City and see the outside world.\u201d Zhao Feng had such a wish within his heart, he had lost his feel of belonging here.From the day he had seen the mysterious girl at the canyon, he was full of longing for the outside world. Inside the dimension within his left eye, that palm of the girl was replayed back and forth. Up to now, he still hadn\u2019t understood the profoundness contained in it.In the blink of an eye, half a month passed. Zhao Feng calculated the days and realised that he just turned fourteen.He had been training hard these days and Lightly Micro Step had reached the peak level. He realised that his understanding of high ranked martial arts got easier as he understood the One with the Heavens aura. It was similar to a Martial Master learning low ranked martial arts, obviously, it would be much simpler.Zhao Feng felt that even Star Finger didn\u2019t seem so hard anymore. Now, his Star Finger was not far away from late stages of the fourth level. On the day that Zhao Feng turned fourteen, a guest came to the Zhao family. At this moment, all the core members of the Zhao sect\u2019s high level were there. Apart from Elder Zhao who was guarding the Martial Arts Library, all the other elders were present.\u201cWhat does my family have for \u201cMaster Ye\u201d to come personally?\u201d The head of the sect seemed looked at the figure sitting on the head seat.The person sitting on the sect leader\u2019s seat was a middle aged man around thirty five years of age. He looked like a mortal, someone that didn\u2019t cultivate. But every action he made, every breath he took, shocked the elders. Only those of the seventh rank or higher could feel the danger emitting from the man although he had already concealed his aura.\u201cI heard that the Xin and Zhao family both have a very talented genius. I\u2019m under orders from Lord Guanjun to investigate this.\u201d After this was said, the breathing rate of everyone present increased.Lord Guanjun!Cold sweat poured out from Zhao Tiancang\u2019s head. Being a city under the Guangjun Provinces\u2019 City\u2019s control, how could they not know who Lord Guanjun was?The Zhao family was in just one of the twelve cities under the Guanjun province and the dictator of the province was Lord Guanjun!His story was a legend itself. Lord Guanjun was one of the seven major lords, he had extremely high cultivation. Apparently, he had once solo killed two hundred thousand soldiers, slew eighteen martial masters of the seventh rank or higher, and killed the enemy general who was of the ninth rank. Apparently, Lord Guanjun slew five high tier deadly beasts in one blow, all of them stronger than the Two Winged Sword Teeth Tiger that Zhao Feng had met.Apparently, he had reached the ninth rank before thirty years of age. Tens of years later, there were even rumours that he had reached the legendary Holy martial path! It didn\u2019t matter whether or not the legend was true as Lord Guanjun was one of the powerhouses of this country!What was the Zhao family compared to it?And now.This Master Ye had came to the Zhao sect under orders from that man. Instantly, the people present looked at each other full of excitement.\u201cWe dare ask, who is the genius that Master Ye is looking for?\u201d Zhao Tiancang wiped the sweat off his forehead.This Master Ye was of the ninth rank and he had a high chance of being one of Lord Guanjun\u2019s right hand man. Throughout Sun Feather City, there was only a tiny chance of having cultivators of the eighth rank. With Master Ye\u2019s strength, he could kill Martial Masters as easily as he killed cats and dogs. It could be said that the Zhao family had no resistance against him.\u201cAccording to my information, the Xin and Zhao family both have a genius both. I don\u2019t know their names\u2026 I just recently went to the Xin family but the result dissapointed me\u2026 \u201d Master Ye couldn\u2019t help but shake his head.Obviously, he didn\u2019t get to see Xin Wuheng, who had disappeared after the summit. There was still no sign of him even after one month and apart from Xin Wuheng, the Xin family didn\u2019t have any especially outstanding youths.\u201cUm\u2026 Without the name we don\u2019t know which one you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Light flashed through Zhao Tiancang\u2019s eyes.Master Ye casually said: \u201cThat\u2019s easy, just get out the most talented person.\u201dThe head of the sect exchanged looks with the others. If they were talking about the most talented person, then they would have to choose between Zhao Feng and Zhao Linlong. But Zhao Feng had just received a confinement order and they had suspicions of him joining the Qiu family.\u201cHaha, could the Zhao sect not even know their genius?\u201d Master Ye laughed as he released his aura.That moment, the pressure inside the room increased. An unbearable pressure crushed towards Zhao Tiancang and co.\u201cThere\u2026 There is one.\u201d Zhao Tiancang quickly said: \u201cWe have an outstanding genius within our sect, he\u2019s my son Zhao Linlong. He\u2019s reached the sixth rank before eighteen years of old and he has gained some insights into Holy martial arts a few days ago.\u201dZhao Linlong!The other elders immediately nodded their heads in agreement. It was true that Zhao Linlong had the highest cultivation amongst the youngsters. Furthermore, he had gained some insights into the partial Holy martial arts, this was something that some elders couldn\u2019t even do.\u201cOh? Bring him out.\u201d Master Ye seemed to be interested.\u201cSomeone go fetch Zhao Linlong!\u201dSoon.Zhao Linlong clad in gold came into the room and greeted everyone present. When he found that the head of the sect wasn\u2019t sitting at his usual seat, he was full of shock.From the situation, it seemed that the elders seemed to be in fear of him.\u201cHmm\u2026 eighteen years old, sixth rank, meh, average.\u201d Master Ye nodded his head slightly, but he didn\u2019t seem happy.Average?Zhao Linlong felt anger creep into his heart. The elders seemed to be stunned as well. After all, there was only Zhao Linlong who had reached the sixth rank before eighteen years old.Obviously, they didn\u2019t know that Xin Wuheng and Zhao Feng had both reached the sixth rank with Xin Wuheng reaching the peak sixth rank. Zhao Linlong was almost eighteen and Zhao Feng had just turned fourteen. Even with his fifth rank cultivation, it was obvious that his potential was higher than Zhao Linlong\u2019s.\u201cShow me some of your skills.\u201d The man said expressionlessly.\u201cYes, Master Ye.\u201d Zhao Linlong couldn\u2019t help but contain his excitement.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFrom the meaning in his step fathers eyes, he knew this was a chance to change his destiny.Spatial Cloud Finger!Zhao Linlong exclaimed and used his best move. At the same time, he used his Shadow Step as well. After showing his skills, Zhao Linlong seemed to be full of confidence. Every finger he pushed out seemed to blast through the sky.\u201cGood! Good!\u201dThe elders couldn\u2019t help but nod their heads and cheer for him. But on the highest seat, Master Ye sat expressionlessly. No one knew what he thought.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Throwing away the fact that he had the highest cultivation, every skill that he showed was perfect. His Spatial Cloud Finger was now even better than what it was at the summit and his Shadow Step closed in on the max level.Zhao Linlong started to work even harder after his defeat and under the pressure, his strength became even greater. Even some sixth ranks of the older generation weren\u2019t his opponent.\u201cNot bad.\u201d The head of the sect and elders nodded their heads.From their point of view, Zhao Linlong\u2019s strength was indeed top tier in Sun Feather City. They turned to Master Ye.\u201cMaster Ye, how do you feel\u2026 ?\u201d Zhao Tiancang couldn\u2019t help but ask.Once his step son Zhao Linlong was chosen by Guanjun Palace, his future days couldn\u2019t be estimated. It would only be a matter of time before Sun Feather City was controlled by the Zhao sect. The other elders looked on expectantly.\u201cSo \u2013 so.\u201d The words were like a hammer that heavily hit Zhao Tiancang.How could this be\u2026 so-so?\u201cSo-so?\u201d Zhao Linlong\u2019s face turned red.Anger surged in his heart. Being the genius with the highest cultivation within Sun Feather City, he had only received a so-so review.\u201cOh yeah! Linlong! Didn\u2019t you gain something from the partial Holy martial art?\u201d The sect leader warned.Partial Holy martial art!Yes!Eyes lit up amongst the elders.\u201cHehe.\u201d Some interest was finally be seen in Master Ye\u2019s eyes.\u201cYes, step-father.\u201d Zhao Linlong took a deep breath and closed his eyes.Suddenly, his aura changed.Hu~At this moment, Zhao Linlong had the aura that Xin Wuheng had on the summit day but way fainter, only around one tenth of the latters.\u201cWind Flowing Stance!\u201dHua!An unseen wind wave swept up everything in a radius of several metres. This casual swipe could seriously injure most cultivators under the seventh rank.\u201cGood, good!\u201d The elders couldn\u2019t help but applause.This was what they truly felt at heart, they weren\u2019t acting. Their insights gained into the partial Holy martial art weren\u2019t much stronger than Zhao Linlong\u2019s. After their cheering, they once again looked expectantly at Master Ye.There shouldn\u2019t be any problems this time, right?A faint smile appeared on Zhao Linlong\u2019s face.\u201cThis is your so-called insight from a partial Holy martial art? The power of it isn\u2019t even stronger than your Spatial Cloud Finger! You haven\u2019t even touched the corner of a Holy martial art yet! Useless!\u201d The cold, expressionless voice sounded within the room.Instantly!Dead silence fell.How was this possible?Zhao Linlong felt somewhat dissatisfied. However, the man sitting there was one of the country\u2019s few ninth ranks.Ninth rank of the Martial Path!Even if they were unsatisfied, they didn\u2019t have any courage to rebuke him.\u201cThe genius I am looking for\u2026 is not him.\u201d Master Ye said harshly.On the day of the summit, the two Guanjun Corps didn\u2019t know Zhao Feng and Xin Wuheng\u2019s names, but they had seen their potential and talents. The potential of those two were ranked in the top five of Guanjun Province. And Zhao Linlong\u2019s performance wasn\u2019t even able to reach the top twenty.\u201cMaster Ye, Linlong\u2019s cultivation is the highest amongst the younger generation.\u201d Zhao Tiancang said helplessly.At this moment, the other elders realised who Master Ye truly wanted, but they had confined that person. This was the reason that Zhao Tiancang didn\u2019t mention him.A few seconds of silence.\u201cCall all the youngsters of the fifth rank or higher here.\u201d Master Ye ordered.Zhao Tiancang immediately did what he said.Soon.Zhao Yufei, Zhao Chi annd Zhao Han all came to the room. There was only five youths who had reached the fifth rank: Zhao Linlong, Zhao Feng, Zhao Yufei, Zhao Chi and Zhao Han.\u201d But there were only four present.\u201cThis person comes from the Guanjun Province. You must all perform well and if you\u2019re chosen, you may be taken to the Guanjun Palace.\u201d Zhao Tiancang explained.Immediately, expectation rose on their faces. Compared to the Guanjun Palace, their Zhao family was just an ant. If they were chosen by the Guanjun Palace, their future couldn\u2019t be measured.The first person that came up was Zhao Han. When he went up, a powerful, cold Inner Strength flowed out from his body.\u201cFocusing solely on cultivation isn\u2019t good.\u201d Master Ye shook his head.Hope extinguished from Zhao Han\u2019s eyes. In Master Ye\u2019s eyes, his performance was crap. The scene caused Zhao Linlong to let out a breath and even feel slightly good. Zhao Chi then went up next.\u201cAverage, you\u2019re understanding is manageable.\u201d The review was slightly better than before.Finally, it was Zhao Yufei\u2019s turn. Zhao Yufei was the youngesr and therefore, she went last. She immediately performed her Spiritual Wind Slice and under the use of Air Crossing Breathing Technique, all her moves were beautiful.Finally, a light came from the expressionless Master Ye\u2019s eyes: \u201cNot bad.\u201dNot bad!This was the best review he had given. Zhao Linlong\u2019s face was pretty ugly. In terms of strength and cultivation, he easily surpassed Zhao Yufei. But Zhao Yufei was only fourteen years old, therefore, her potential was far greater.The elders were stunned, they never thought that the one that Master Ye looked most importantly at was Zhao Yufei. But if they thought about it logicall,y Zhao Yufei came from a branch of the main sect and under the conditions of low resource,s she still surpassed what Zhao Linlong achieved at her age.\u201cShe ok, but she\u2019s not the one in the report.\u201d Master Ye\u2019s eyebrows twitched.Not good!The hearts of Zhao Tiancang and co. clenched. But the next moment the most unwanted scene happened.\u201cMaster Ye there\u2019s still a genius that\u2019s even better than me.\u201d Zhao Yufei told Master Ye.From the moment she entered the room, she wondered why Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t present. Only she didn\u2019t know that Zhao Feng had been put under confinement orders for suspicion of treachery.Under those conditions, Zhao Feng was excluded.\u201cHmmm? There\u2019s still one more?\u201d Master Ye\u2019s face turned dark as he surveyed the elders.Those that were looked at by Master Ye felt as if a blade had sliced them.\u201cMaster Ye, the situation is like this\u2026 There\u2019s still a youth in the sect, but he\u2019s under suspicions of betraying the family\u2026\u201d\u201cShut up!\u201dAnger surged on Master Ye\u2019s face: \u201cI don\u2019t give a f**k if he\u2019s a traitor or not, I just want my bl**dy genius!\u201dHis powerful voice echoed within the room. Zhao Linlong and the others of the younger generation felt their skin go cold. Just the voice alone could cause such pressure. It was hard to imagine what kind of power those of the ninth rank had.\u201cFetch Zhao Feng.\u201d Zhao Tiancang managed to squeeze out these words.The elders sighed in their heart. Zhao Linlong\u2019s fists were clenched and his were teeth clenched, full of unwillingness.How could the top genius of the Zhao family be replaced by someone of the branch sect?\u201cZhao Feng won\u2019t be chosen by him. Even if he is, so what? I\u2019ll still make him lose face!\u201d Zhao Linlong darkly said.Later.A handsome youth walked steadily into the room.\u201cWho came to the Zhao family today?\u201dFrom the situation, it seemed the elders and the sect leader were all under orders from the man at the top seat. The moment he opened his left eye, he felt the powerful pressure emitting from him. What was even more shocking was that his Inner Strength had reached an extreme level.If Zhao Linlong\u2019s Inner Strength was said to be a patch of cold water, then the head of the sect\u2019s could be said to be a bath of boiling hot water. But compared to this man clothed in green, his was like metal! His quantity and quality had reached a peak state.\u201cSo strong!\u201d Zhao Feng quickly closed the ability of his left eye.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe person in front of him may be the strongest person he had seen so far, excluding the girl at the canyon.\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d Master Ye asked.\u201cZhao Feng.\u201d The voice was steady.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Interest showed on his face.The aura from his breathing didn\u2019t cause the youth in front of him to panic and somehow\u2026 he had the feeling that he couldn\u2019t see through him. Zhao Feng\u2019s real cultivation was at the sixth rank and when he wanted to fully conceal it, even Master Ye couldn\u2019t easily see it\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

His cultivation was the highest and his performance had only gotten a 'so-so\u201d. Zhao Feng did nothing and he had received \u201cnot bad\u201d.\u201cZhao Feng! This is Master Ye from the Guanjun Province and he represents the Guanjun Palace to come here to choose a genius from the Zhao sect. You better perform well, this is your chance to repent for your sins.\u201d Zhao Tiancang, the head of the sect managed to squeeze out a smile, but his voice was somewhat stale.Repent for my sins?Zhao Feng laughed coldly in his heart, but he didn\u2019t bother to explain.\u201cThis one sees Master Ye.\u201d Zhao Feng respectfully bowed.\u201cEn.\u201d Master Ye nodded his head and signalled for him to performance.Under everyone\u2019s eyes, Zhao Feng took in a breath to calm himself down. His calmness far surpassed others, even Zhao Linlong or Zhao Yufei couldn\u2019t be compared to him. Even Zhao Feng didn\u2019t realise that a weird aura was released from his left eye into his body and that at every critical moment, he would remain calm. Surprise was found in Master Ye\u2019s eyes as he realised that this youth wasn\u2019t simple.Flamin Metal Fist!Zhao Feng\u2019s first punch was his most familiar skill. Core ranked martial art? The geniuses and elders present were shocked. Zhao Feng\u2019s core ranked fist skill had surpassed the max level and it had surpassed the original skill.\u201cNot bad.\u201d Master Ye once again nodded his head.Zhao Feng kept on punching and unconsciously, he merged the One with the Heavens aura into it.Hu~Zhao Feng\u2019s simple punch seemed to contain a flaming dragon. The moment the fist was out, it seemed like he put his power all into one point perfectly. It was as if that simple punch contained a deeper insight.\u201cCore ranked martial art. It\u2019s not simple to train it to this level.\u201dThe elder\u2019s nodded their heads, but they didn\u2019t put it to their hearts. No matter how special it was, it was still a core ranked martial art and wasn\u2019t comparable to peak ranked martial arts. Zhao Linlong had disdain in his eyes.\u201cGood!\u201d A voice of extreme joy echoed in the room.Shock and excitement shone in Master Ye\u2019s eyes. The voice had come from him.Good?Zhao Tiancang and Zhao Linlong almost died from choking on their own breaths. They seemed to have seen a ghost. The earlier reviews made them understand how hard it was for him to give a good review.\u201cCore ranked martial art\u2026 How the f**k is this possible!?\u201d Zhao Linlong almost didn\u2019t explode.From their level, they just couldn\u2019t see what was so special about Zhao Feng\u2019s core ranked fist skill.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 It looks like the genius I wanted is you.\u201d Master Ye let out a long laugh, his attitude was completely different from before.\u201cThanks for your review.\u201d Zhao Feng was also stunned.Originally, he wanted to start from his core ranked martial art, then build up to Angry Dragon Fist and then Star Finger. But when he was performing the core ranked martial art, he had somehow merged the two together.\u201cIn my eyes you are the true genius.\u201d Master Ye walked down from his seat.You are the true genius!As he said that, Zhao Linlong\u2019s face turned extremely ugly.Why!?Unwillingness screamed in his heart. Zhao Feng had gotten a better review from just a core ranked martial art, how could he be willing?\u201cMy name is Ye Linyun, maybe we can be friends later on.\u201d Master Ye seemed to be extremely respectful of Zhao Feng.The scene made Zhao Tiancang and the elders drop their jaws.Why would a ninth rank martial mastertry and become friends with such a youth?Even Zhao Feng himself stunned. The only reason he could think of was the One with the Heavens aura. It was confirmed that if Xin Wuheng didn\u2019t disappear, he would also be taken in by Master Ye.\u201cMaster Ye, you\u2019re too nice\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know how to express himself.He didn\u2019t dare to treat Master Ye as his friend. This was the same as an ant and an elephant being friends.\u201cHehe, Zhao Feng you\u2019re too humble. One day you\u2019ll realise you will have the right to do so.\u201d Ye Lingyun shook his head while smiling.At this moment, he didn\u2019t seem strict at all. The scene made the others extremely confused. Zhao Linlong was especially so, he was extremely furious.\u201cZhao Feng are you willing to join the Guanjun Corps?\u201d Ye Linyun asked.Willing or unwilling, aren\u2019t these just useless words? Furthermore, Ye Linyun\u2019s attitude was just too nice.Zhao Feng spoke deeply: \u201cMy goal was to leave Sun Feather City anyway and experience the outside world, so I am willing.\u201dEntering the Guanjun Palace didn\u2019t conflict with his goals. The scale of Guanjun City far surpassed Sun Feather City and it was a wider stage for him.\u201cGood, if you work hard, maybe you\u2019ll even receive personal lessons from Lord Guanjun.\u201dYe Linyun smiled.Lord Guanjun?Zhao Feng immediately thanked him. Although he lived in Sun Feather City, he had still heard of Lord Guanjun\u2019s legends because he was the highest dictator in a ten thousand mile radius and he had reached an extremely high level in martial arts. Even Sun Feather City, the Zhao sect, were under his control. The Zhao sect didn\u2019t have any status or right to even try and flatter these people.At this moment, Zhao Feng clearly felt the envious eyes from Zhao Linlong and Zhao Han. He was able to enter the Guanjun Palace and he had the chance to receive personal lessons from Lord Guanjun. How could they not be jealous?Zhao Han and Zhao Chi could be thrown aside as they knew the difference between Zhao Feng and them. They had all seen the performance of Zhao Feng that day on the summit, therefore they knew that they had no right to rebuke him.But there was still one person and that was Zhao Linlong!Jealously, unwillingness and envy burned in his heart.Why!? Why!?In terms of cultivation, he was top amongst the younger generation. In terms of martial arts, he had touched the boundaries of partial Holy martial arts. Even if there still was difference between them, he wouldn\u2019t watch himself be beaten just by Zhao Feng\u2019s simple core ranked punches.\u201cI disagree!\u201d The anger within Zhao Linlong\u2019s heart finally exploded.Silence fell within the room.\u201cLinlong! No!\u201d Zhao Tiancang and the others tried to stop him.Although they were confused of why Ye Linyun chose Zhao Feng, they didn\u2019t dare question him.\u201cWhy do you disagree?\u201d A smile of mockery appeared on Ye Linyun\u2019s face.\u201cGive me a chance! I\u2019ll use my own strength to prove that I am stronger than him. Isn\u2019t that the rule of this world that only the strong can make choices?\u201d Zhao Linlong stared at Zhao Feng and erupted his aura of the sixth rank.If it was a normal fourth or fifth ranker, they would have been scared but Zhao Feng didn\u2019t seem to be affected at all even though his cultivation was suppressed.\u201cOnly the strong can make rules! I\u2019ll give you one chance, if you can beat Zhao Feng, you can also enter the Guanjun Palace.\u201dYe Lingyun laughed as he turned to Zhao Feng: \u201cI\u2019ve only just seen your core ranked martial arts and this will let me see your combat abilities.\u201d\u201cYes sir.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head.The two faced off in the room.Ever since Zhao Feng had entered the main branch, the two had never fought. This was their first time fighting one another.\u201cZhao Feng! I will use my strength to prove that I have more right than you to enter Guanjun Palace.\u201dLooking at the scene, the other youngsters were full of expectations. One of them was the top genius of the Zhao family, while the other was once the top genius of the Zhao family.One was the most talented in Sun Feather City. One had the highest cultivation amongst the younger generation within Sun Feather City.This was the first time the two would meet in battle.\u201cSpatial Cloud Finger!\u201d Zhao Linlong exclaimed as he pointed out a finger with a purple glow around it.At the same time, he activated Shadows Step and left an afterimage where he originally stood.Star Finger!An azure light came from Zhao Feng\u2019s finger and clashed heavily with Zhao Linlong\u2019s Spatial Cloud Finger.Boom!The two peak ranked martial arts met one another causing their robes to fly in the wind.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTeng! Teng! Teng\u2026The two moved back simultaneously. Zhao Linlong retreated five steps and he felt blood gurgle through his throat. Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t that well off either, he felt the finger that clashed with Zhao Linlong turn numb.\u201cStar Finger!\u201d\u201cThe third level of Star Finger! How could he have reached it at such a young age!?\u201d The elders understood how terrifying Star Finger was.Star Finger was the most powerful skill in the Martial Arts Library. There were many people training it, but they finally dropped it as it was too hard to learn and they had a high chance of injuring themselves.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It was indeed frightening for someone with lower cultivation to gain the upper hand.\u201cZhao Feng has the advantage because of Star Finger and his body strengthening technique\u2026 \u201d Zhao Tiancang sighed and didn\u2019t bother to conceal the shock on his face. His voice was also just loud enough to let Zhao Linlong hear.Zhao Feng\u2019s Metal Wall Technique had reached the fifth level and he had unimaginable power. He was still suppressing his cultivation, so his Metal Wall Technique only seemed to be at the peak fourth level.The power of his Star Finger was indeed stronger than Zhao Linlong\u2019s Spatial Cloud Finger.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Zhao Linlong roared and once again condense his Inner Strength.In that short moment, he had reached his peak state. If it was any other genius here they would probably die.\u201cThird Stance Star Finger!\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes became sharp as an azure light swished through the air.Pew\u2014\u2013His finger slashed through the air and became an azure light.Poof! Poof! Pew\u2014\u2013Zhao Feng\u2019s offense warded Zhao Linlong off repeatedly.Wah!On the eigth move, Zhao Linlong\u2019s face turned white and he spat out a mouthful of blood. From the situation, it seemed that Zhao Linlong couldn\u2019t manage to exchange ten blows with Zhao Feng.\u201cThis is a second Xin Wuheng.\u201d Zhao Han and Zhao Chi looked at each other and nodded their heads.But thinking about it, Zhao Feng and Xin Wuheng both came first and Xin Wuheng had admitted defeat. From this, they could see that Zhao Feng\u2019s strength was only higher than Xin Wuheng\u2019s and not lower.\u201cFlowing Wind Stance!\u201dOn the ninth move, Zhao Linlong\u2019s aura changed.Hu~A thick purple light whipped heavily towards Zhao Feng.What kind of move was this?Zhao Chi, Zhao Han and Zhao Yufei felt their hearts shake. Even Zhao Feng, who had the upper hand, felt some pressure.\u201cCould this be the partial Holy martial art?\u201d Zhao Feng soon regained his composure and condensed more energy into Star Finger.One Line Star Finger!The azure light came and went like a meteor.\u201cWhat\u2026? He\u2019s learnt One Line Star Finger!?\u201d\u201cOne Line Star Finger! The killing move of Star Finger. If he\u2019s learnt this already then he\u2019s not far away from the fourth level.\u201d The elders were extremely shocked.Star Finger was the strongest skill, but it was also the hardest one to learn at the same time. For the past one hundred years, many geniuses tried to learn Star Finger, but their results were all the same; their finger either got disfigured or the speed of learning it was slow, so they finally gave up. This skill was not just hard, there was too much danger involved as well.One elder from the earlier generation had said that Star Finger was on the half Holy martial art level, but it was just too dangerous. But in this generation, a branch disciple had managed to learn Star Finger.Pew\u2026One Line Star Finger slashed through the air and broke through Zhao Linlong\u2019s Flowing Wind Stance. Zhao Linlong\u2019s figure trembled as his sleeve was ripped open.\u201cYou\u2019ve lost!\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s finger stopped at his arm\u2019s acupuncture point.Star Finger contained many skills within it including, hitting acupuncture points etc.I\u2019ve lost?Zhao Linlong went into shock. It wasn\u2019t as if he never thought of himself losing, it was just the difference between them was too great. He thought how childish it was when he didn\u2019t put Zhao Feng in his eyes.\u201cNot bad, you can already control your Inner Strength perfectly.\u201d Ye Linyun praised.He found Zhao Feng more and more to his liking after this battle. Challenging high ranks was rare even in Province City. Furthermore, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t seem to try that hard at all. Zhao Tiancang and his cronies looked at each other and sighed deeply.They could obviously see that Zhao Feng\u2019s One Line Star Finger could destroy Zhao Linlong\u2019s arm but he didn\u2019t do so. The battle between two top tier geniuses of Sun Feather City ended here. Ye Linyun looked at Zhao Feng, then at Zhao Yufei and he seemed pretty pleased.Although he had missed the genius of the Xin family, he had gotten two from the Zhao family. Zhao Feng\u2019s performance far exceeded his expectations.\u201cYou two go and prepare your stuff. In three days, we will go head towards Province City.\u201d Ye Linyun told the two.Shua!Ye Linyun turned into a blur. The next second, he disappeared.So fast!Without using his left eye, Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t even see his shadow. If Ye Linyun was to attack, no one would be able to resist including the sect leader and the elders.\u201cIs that the power of the ninth rank? Then, how strong would Lord Guanjun be?\u201d Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but take in a deep breath.\u201cSect leader, there\u2019s still three days left. I need to go back to Green Leaf Village.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes focused on Zhao Tiancang.He was under confinement orders from the family.\u201cGo.\u201dAlthough Zhao Tiancang was the head of the sect, he felt useless. The word seemed to pull out all of his energy. Now Zhao Feng was one of Guanjun Palace\u2019s men, he wouldn\u2019t have the guts to do anything to him.\u201cBut we hope that you give an answer to Zhao Tiancang\u2019s death. From the Star Finger you just used, you have the ability to kill them.\u201d Light flashed within Zhao Tiancang\u2019s eyes.At this moment, he just wanted an answer. Even if Zhao Feng\u2019s answer was that he joined the Qiu family, they couldn\u2019t do anything to him.\u201cZhao Tianjian was indeed killed by me, but I didn\u2019t betray the Zhao family.\u201d Zhao Feng laughed.\u201cIt was you\u2026 \u201dBefore, they were just suspicious and didn\u2019t really believe that Zhao Feng had the ability to kill the two.\u201cOne more point. The real one that teamed up with the Qiu family wasn\u2019t me\u2026 if you want to know the answer, you could go and find some information from Zhao Tianjian\u2019s place\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng left this sentence behind and then left the room.Could it be\u2026 ?Understanding showed on their faces.On the same day.The high level of the sect immediately sent out men to secure Zhao Tianjian\u2019s family, including Zhao Yijian.Zhao Yijian didn\u2019t know what happened, but they did find some proof within the family linking them to the Qiu family. Finally the truth was found. The high level of the sect finally realised the unfair treatment of Zhao Feng. Usually, they wouldn\u2019t really care, but now it was different. Zhao Feng had been selected into Guanjun Palace and he had an unlimited future, his future determined the Zhao family\u2019s future.Therefore, the sect leader ordered Elder Zhao to go and comfort Zhao Feng.\u201cHahahaha\u2026 it feels so good to see the expressions on their faces.\u201d Elder Zhao didn\u2019t feel sympathetic for them at all, instead, he was happy.\u201cOh yeah, the high level have decided to open the third floor of the Martial Arts Library for you.\u201d He took back another piece of news.Third floor of the Martial Arts Library? A smile appeared on Zhao Feng\u2019s face. This result was within his expectations.On the second day, three elders including Elder Zhao came to the third floor. The third floor was an extremely mysterious place. One elder alone couldn\u2019t open it. The sect had its rules: three elders must agree simultaneously to open it. A dark green stone door was the path to the third floor.Weng~The stone door hummed as if a certain mechanism had been opened. Then, the door swung open. Zhao Feng immediately stepped in and found himself in a stone room. On the wall, there were weird pictures carved onto it. Some were moving while some places were blurred. Under the combined power of the three martial masters, the picture seemed to come alive.Flowing Wind Stance! Tornado Stance! Partial Wind Stance! Burning Wind Stance\u2026Every picture had a different stance to it, but due to age of it, the pictures weren\u2019t very clear. Zhao Feng felt that even with the power of three martial masters, it wasn\u2019t enough to fully activate the pictures.\u201cThe series of pictures combine to form a complete Holy martial art, but the wall is kind of blurry and there isn\u2019t enough power to fully activate it.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye quickly scanned over the pictures.\u201cZhao Feng, we can only sustain this for thirty more breaths. If you can gain anything from it, it\u2019s all up to you.\u201d Elder Zhao\u2019s voice sounded from outside.Thirty breaths!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng\u2019s heart clenched.Shua!Immediately, he pushed his left eye to the maximum and went into enhanced-vision mode.Under his left eye, the pictures on the stone wall became clearer.\u201cCopy!\u201d Zhao Feng spat out a word and one of the pictures was absorbed into the dimension in his left eye.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 63": "Chapter 63Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 63 \u2013 Victorious ReturnA picture appeared in the dimension of his left eye. He had copied the picture into his mind and although it wasn\u2019t a complete Holy martial art, it still surpassed peak ranked martial arts.Flowing Wind Stance!Zhao Feng saw the name under the picture. This move was the exact same one that Zhao Linlong used before, but the latter had only just touched the edges of it. Soon, the second picture appeared in his mind. The scenery of the second picture was more complex than the first one.The second Stance, Tornado!Zhao Feng successfully copied the picture into his mind. but felt tiredness overwash him. The more complex the thing he copied, the more mental energy it would rake.The third stance, Partial Wind Stance!Zhao Feng clenched his teeth and forcefully took the picture into his mind. This one was even more complex than the one before and at this time, he felt even more tired.Cold sweat came out from Zhao Feng\u2019s forehead, with his remaining energy, it was obvious that he couldn\u2019t copy the fourth picture.Hu!He took a deep breath and closed in his eyes. He then circulated Air Crossing Breathing Technique to recover. Outside the room, the three elders could only sustain the room for thirty breaths and the time was decreasing as each moment passed.Ten breaths\u2026 Fifteen breaths\u2026 Twenty breaths\u2026The time was reaching the limit.Twenty-five breaths\u2026 Twenty-six breaths\u2026 twenty-seven breaths\u2026Zhao Feng\u2019s breathing became faster and faster. Right now, the tiredness started to fade away.At the last two breaths.Burning Wind Slice!Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye suddenly opened and a faint green light appeared on his eye as he forcefully copied the fourth picture.Hong\u2026The next instant, he felt his consciousness over run by a wall of fire. The chaotic burning wind seemed to destroy anything and everything in it\u2019s path.\u201cIs this power within the limits of cultivators?\u201dZhao Feng felt his mouth turn dry and it was as if all the water in his body had been evaporated. But in reality, he hadn\u2019t been injured in any way; it was just an illusion.Shua!The the fourth picture was taken into his left eye.Done!Zhao Feng tiredly fell down on his bum. At almost the exact same time, the three elders outside took back their Inner Strength.Weng!The pictures on the wall once again fell silent and stopped moving. It seemed like they were just ordinary pictures.\u201cHow much insight did you gain?\u201d The three elders outside asked.Insights?Zhao Feng flinched, he actually didn\u2019t gain any insights from the third floor yet.\u201cIt\u2019s alright. These pictures are pretty blurry and most of the geniuses that have been inside have gained almost nothing.\u201d Elder Zhao comforted.They didn\u2019t feel anything weird when Zhao Feng didn\u2019t gain any insights.\u201cYeah, even if you did, the little amount you gained is still not better than a peak ranked martial art.\u201d One of the other elders nodded their head in agreement.The third floor was never opened for two reasons: One, it needed the power of three elders at once and they could only sustain it for thirty breaths. Second, the Holy martial art was just too blurry and the insights gained were just too small.Thirty breaths was just too short for anyone to fully gain anything.\u201cThank you elders for your effort.\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t seem disappointed at all.Yes, it was true he didn\u2019t gain anything within the thirty breaths, but he had copied all four pictures into his mind.Returning home.Zhao Feng closed his eyes and first focused on recovering his mental energy. Then, when his mental energy reached its peak state, he started to look at the four partial Holy martial art skills.The four weren\u2019t complete Holy martial arts, they had parts missing and they were blurry. But even then, Zhao Feng felt that these skills weren\u2019t that hard.The first and second stances were easier than his Mysterious Wind Palm and the third stance was on par with it.The fourth stance contained a will to destroy everything. Even though it was incomplete, it had still exceeded the limits of the human body\u2026Ages later.Zhao Feng let out a long breath and shook his head. He was only able to fully comprehend the first move, Flowing Wind Stance, but the full comprehension of this skill didn\u2019t have much of an effect on his overall strength, it wasn\u2019t even as good as learning a peak ranked martial art.This was because the first stance Flowing Wind Stance was a support skill, it wasn\u2019t an offensive or defensive skill.Because of this, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t dwell on it that much. Although he had a feeling that although these four skills might not be of use to him now, they will be in the future.On the morning of the second day, Zhao Feng, along with his parents, went back to Green Leaf Village.In another two days, he would leave Sun Feather City and go to the Guanjun Province City thousands of miles away.\u201cIn the blink of an eye, I\u2019ve been at the main branch for almost a year.\u201dZhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but remember that he was only a cultivator of the first rank when he entered. In one year\u2019s time, he had increased by leaps and bounds and reached the sixth rank.\u201cWith your cultivation and age nothing in Green Leaf Village can stop you.\u201d His father, Zhao Tianyang, said.His parents were both very proud of their son. The branch sect leader was Zhao Kayuan, an old man who had reached the fourth rank. Apart from him, the strongest were of the third rank.When they received news of Zhao Feng\u2019s return, the head of the family personally came out to greet him. Thinking back then, Zhao Feng was also the top genius of Green Leaf Village. Now he returned like a hero.Soon, they walked into the branch sect\u2019s pavilion. This building was nowhere near close to what the main sect\u2019s building was. It had tattered holes in it everywhere due to its age.\u201cFeng\u2019er you\u2019re achievements today far exceed my expectations.\u201d Zhao Kayuan couldn\u2019t help but exclaim.In just a short one year\u2019s time, Zhao Feng had reached the fifth rank and he was the strongest in the branch sect. This was something that no one expected. Usually, the youths recommended by the branch sect were sent back. Truthfully, the elders of the branch sect didn\u2019t put too much hope in them.Zhao Feng was slightly stunned when he learned of the truth. The elders of Green Leaf Village had never even thought about him becoming one of the geniuses at the main sect, they had even made preparations for him being sent back.Just as the people were speaking, screams and shouts came from outside the main gate.What happened?Zhao Feng\u2019s eyebrows scrunched up and the conversation was stopped in the room.\u201cHead of the sect, the Liu\u2019s families men have come for trouble again.\u201d A few youths who had faces full of bruises came rushing in.\u201cRidiculous!\u201dThe head of the family Zhao Kayuan stood up.\u201cLiu family?\u201d Light flashed in Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes.He was born in Green Leaf Village and so he was familiar with the Liu family. For the past tens of years, the Liu family had quickly risen and expanded in strength and they had become the biggest family within Green Leaf Village.Although Green Leaf Village couldn\u2019t be compared to Sun Feather City, they were still a force to be reckoned with. Zhao Feng remembered that there was rumours of two to three cultivators of the fifth rank at the Liu family.\u201cFor the past year the Liu family had taken the properties of many families and now they want to buy the mine of ours for only three thousand pieces of silver.\u201d Zhao Kayuan said full of rage.\u201cHehe, the Liu family does have guts!\u201dZhao Feng laughed coldly then went outside.\u201cFeng\u2019er, don\u2019t rush. The Liu family now have a cultivator of the sixth rank\u2026 \u201dThe sect leader immediately tried to stop him. Zhao Feng was strong, but he was only one person. How could he fight the Liu family?The Liu family alone had tens of Martial Artists. Two had reached the fifth and now one had reached the sixth!Angry Dragon Fist!Outside the gate Zhao Feng punched one of the cultivators from the Liu family.\u201cThis guy\u2019s a fifth rank. Every attack together!\u201d The leader exclaimed.The bunch immediately pounced towards Zhao Feng.\u201cQuick! Support Feng\u2019er!\u201d Zhao Tianyang and Zhao Kayuan both exclaimed.The situation turned into chaos.\u201cLet me fight alone.\u201d From the crowd, Zhao Feng shouted.Boom boom boom\u2026His leg immediately sent may cultivators of the Liu family flying. Zhao Feng faced the tens of people alone. Anyone that came within range of him received broken limbs in return.Zhao Feng soon turned into a blur and knocked down the leader.\u201cAhhh\u2026 \u201d\u201cYoung master! Please forgive us!\u201dThe group had all been defeated by one person. Amidst the scream and dust, that figure seemed so handsome and tall.\u201cHahaha\u2026 \u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe people from the branch sect finally let out their laughter. Zhao Feng shook his head, these people were just too weak.\u201cThat Liu family will definitely come for revenge. Shouldn\u2019t we go fortify our defenses first?\u201d Zhao Kayuan seemed disturbed.The Liu family was after all the strongest faction in Green Leaf Village and it was around ten times stronger than the Zhao branch family.Defend?Zhao Feng coldly said: \u201cWhy do we need to defend? Why don\u2019t we just go to them?\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

We should go and kill them all.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s words shocked the others.Attack the Liu family?Zhao Kayuan was full of fear: \u201cNonono! The Liu family is the god of Green Leaf Village\u2026 \u201dIn their minds, the Liu family was unbeatable. All they could do was defend. As for taking the offensive, they didn\u2019t dare to think about it unless they thought their lives were too long.\u201cLeave this to me.\u201dZhao Feng left an afterimage where he stood. The next instant, he jumped onto the roof and disappeared in a few breaths.Not good!Zhao Kayuan and Zhao Tianyang felt uneasy. How could a youth beat the Liu family?\u201cFollow him!\u201dWithin the room, the two shouted. However, no one in Green Leaf Village could catch up to Zhao Feng. Even Zhao Kayuan\u2019s speed was not even half of his. Outside, Zhao Feng circulated Lightly Floating Ferry and lept between the trees. His feet barely touched the ground as he ran. Now, his Lightly Floating Ferry had reached the high level. But when he used this skill, Zhao Feng could use Flowing Wind Stance with it.Flowing Wind Stance was the easiest move out of the four incomplete Holy martial arts. At this moment, when he used Flowing Wind Stance and Lightly Floating Ferry together, his figure became swifter and more agile as if he was the wind itself.Teng! Teng!Zhao Feng felt his body become lighter and the leaps he made become smoother.In another instant, his speed once again increased.Shua!A blur came and left at an unbelievable speed. Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t contain his happiness, this Flowing Wind Stance had such a wonderful effect. Therefore, it could be seen that Zhao Linlong had gone off the right track when he mistook it for an offensive skill.Green Leaf Village, Liu family.\u201cElder, a genius from the Zhao family came and injured our brothers.\u201d A cultivator of the Liu family said hurriedly.\u201cHm? The measly Zhao family dares to hurt our people?\u201d A slightly far middle aged man sat within the room.While he was speaking, he even drank slowly from his tea cup. He was the king of Green Leaf Village and all those who dared to challenge them for the past few years had all disappeared. A faction like the Zhao family was just an ant in the Liu family\u2019s eyes. If not for the main Zhao sect, the Liu family would have already taken it over.\u201cElder you\u2019ve got to help us. They\u2019re not putting you in their eyes at all.\u201d The fighters of the Liu family cried.\u201cTell the Zhao family that we\u2019ll give the them one day to hand over that youth or else\u2026 \u201d The voice that eminated from the fat man was cold.\u201cYes yes.\u201d The expressions of the Liu family\u2019s fighters turned to one of joy.\u201cNot good! The youth of the Zhao family has come!\u201d Just at this moment, screams came from outside.Plop! Plop!A blur came into the mansion of the Liu family and no one could even stop one move of his.\u201cSect leader! Sect leader! The youth has already come inside the mansion and injured ten to twenty people!\u201dChaos broke out in the mansion.Within the lounge of the Liu family. The head of the family Liu Guirong sat with two elders and the sixth rank.\u201cThat guy\u2019s speed is just too fast.\u201d One elder as skinny as a branch said.\u201cWhen did the Zhao family have such a talented youth?\u201d The slightly fat elders\u2019 expression was solemn.With their fifth rank cultivation, they couldn\u2019t even see how he moved. It was good that at this moment, the mansion turned calm once again as the youth didn\u2019t appear anymore.Everyone\u2019s eyes turned to the head of the sect, who had the highest cultivation. Liu Guirong\u2019s hair was white, but he still had a composed face: \u201cIn terms of speed, I\u2019m not faster than him.\u201dHow was this possible!?Hearts clenched.After all, Liu Guirong\u2019s cultivation had reached the sixth rank half a year ago and he became the strongest person in Green Leaf Village.What could they do?The Liu family felt that this was pretty troublesome.\u201cObviously, if he faced me head on, I\u2019m certain I can win.\u201d Only the sect leader was composed.\u201cHmph! If that brat dares come here, I\u2019ll make sure he can\u2019t return.\u201d Everyone shouted.At this moment, eighty percent of the high level were present and the strength of them could crush any forced within Green Leaf Village.If that youth from the Zhao family came\u2026 This was the plan that Liu Guirong set up.\u201cHaha, you\u2019re all together. That\u2019s the best! You save me the trouble of finding you all.\u201d A childish laugh came from the roof.The expressions of all the cultivators present changed. When did he reach the roof?Boom!The roof trembled as a youth ripped a hole in it and landed in the middle of the room.The person was Zhao Feng.His landing point was the exact middle of the room, which meant he was surrounded.\u201cHahaha\u2026 Thanks for coming!\u201d The slightly fat elder roared with joy.Smiles appeared on the Liu Guirong\u2019s and the skinny elders\u2019 faces.\u201d The other six cultivators of the fourth rank were full of excitement as well.\u201cYou\u2019re indeed excellent, but just a bit young.\u201dLiu Guirong had his \u201cI will win\u201d face on. If Zhao Feng didn\u2019t come out directly, they couldn\u2019t do anything to him because he was too fast. But now\u2026 Zhao Feng had given up that advantage and face them directly.At this moment, they were looking at Zhao Feng with retarded faces on. Zhao Feng immediately understood what was happening.\u201cIt looks like you haven\u2019t understood who\u2019s the hunter and who\u2019s the hunted.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled.\u201cBrat, die!\u201dThe cultivators closed in on him, full of excitement, only the head of sect had worry in his eyes. But Zhao Feng was already surrounded, so there shouldn\u2019t be any problems.\u201cTake him down!\u201d The slightly fat elder ordered.Howling Tiger Fist!Stone Shattering Palm!Flying Cloud Leg!\u2026\u2026\u2026..The group of cultivators used different skills to attack Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng faced the attack of six people at once. Liu Guirong and the two elders guarded the exits to stop Zhao Feng from escaping.Peng! Peng! Bang\u2026A variety of skills landed on Zhao Feng.Metal Wall Rebound!Zhao Feng\u2019s whole body turned metal-like and rebounded the attacks.Craaaaaack\u2026The sound of bones shattering never ended.Plop! Plop! Plop\u2026The six men fell down to the ground, all seriously injured. The scene shocked the two elders and Liu Guirong.\u201cHow\u2026 How did he do this?\u201d The fat elder screamed.\u201cIt\u2019s your turn.\u201d Zhao Feng turned to face the three.\u201cSir, we can talk diplomatically.\u201dA smile that was even uglier than crying appeared on Liu Guirong\u2019s face. The strength that Zhao Feng had just shown had exceeded what they knew. Even Liu Guirong didn\u2019t have any confidence in beating Zhao Feng.\u201cI\u2019ll give you one day to take all of the men of the Liu family and leave Green Leaf Village or else I\u2019ll cripple all your cultivation.\u201d Zhao Feng said.He had lived at Green Leaf Village for most of his life and he knew how the Liu family usually acted. Therefore, Zhao Feng\u2019s punishment was considered quite light.\u201cYes yes yes!\u201d Liu Guirong immediately answered and looked at the two elders.They agreed this easily?Just as Zhao Feng was wondering.Smashing Wind Palm!Liu Guirong\u2019s Inner Strength exploded as he shot out a high level martial art at Zhao Feng\u2019s forehead.\u201cDieeeeee!\u201d The two elders attacked from the two sides.Under the short distance and the furious attacks of two fifth rankers and one sixth rank, even Zhao Feng was caught off guard.\u201cKid you\u2019re too young!\u201d Liu Guirong laughed hysterically as his palm reached Zhao Feng\u2019s forehead.\u201cRetards!\u201d Zhao Feng coldly laughed and left an afterimage where he originally stood.Not good!The attacks of Liu Guirong and the two elders had all missed, they didn\u2019t even get to touch Zhao Feng\u2019s clothes.Shua!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe next moment, Zhao Feng appeared once again in the middle of the three exactly in the same position as before as if time had flowed backwards.What!?Cold sweat flooded the backs of Liu Guirong and the two elders.\u201cHigh ranked martial arts\u2026 Peak level?\u201d Liu Guirong barely managed to squeeze out these words.At this moment, they had finally realised how terrifying this youth really was.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There was no one in Sun Feather City who had reached max level of a high ranked martial art, including the older generation.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to be ungrateful, then don\u2019t blame me for not holding back.\u201d Killing intent was released from Zhao Feng.Just before Liu Guirong and the two elders had tried to kill him. If it wasn\u2019t for the fact that he was strong, he may have died.Just as Liu Guirong had said, Zhao Feng was still too soft hearted. To be kind to the enemy was to be cruel to yourself.\u201cBreaking Wind Palm, die\u2026 \u201cLiu Guirong pretended to use his killing move, but in reality, his figure went in the opposite direction.Run!The two elders reacted as well. By now, they understood the difference between them and Zhao Feng.\u201cStay!\u201d Zhao Feng ordered as his figure lept into the air and stabbed out his finger multiple times.Ssss\u2026 Sssss\u2026 Ssss\u2026Hissing sounds came from the air. Three azure lights pierced the air and hit their targets.\u201cWuu\u2026 \u201dLiu Guirong\u2019s body stiffened as a hole the size of a finger appeared on his forehead. The expression of fear and shock still remained on his face.Zhao Feng hadn\u2019t even come close to him, so how did a hole appear on his forehead? The two elders however had seen how Zhao Feng moved, but two blood stains appeared on their chests as well.Plop! Plop!The two elders of the fifth rank fell to the ground. Dead.Zhao Feng had used his Spatial Star Finger to kill them.Teng!At this time, Zhao Feng landed on the ground again. He had killed the three of them in only a breath\u2019s time. A Martial Master would probably have difficulty in doing this, but Zhao Feng had increased reaction speed and his left eye had locked on to his targets.\u201cSpare us!\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s cold blooded methods had stunned the six injured martial artists on the ground.In their eyes, Zhao Feng\u2019s methods could be said to be on par with Martial Masters. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t bother to deal with them as he walked slowly out of the lounge.At this time, the people of the branch sect had finally arrived.Coming into the lounge of the Liu family, the sect leader Zhao Kayuan looked at Zhao Feng deeply.\u201cThis is a warning and example for all the powers inside Green Leaf Village.\u201d Zhao Feng stood on the rooftop as his voice resounded around the village.An example!The hearts of everyone trembled as they understood the meaning of the youth\u2019s words. From now on if any power within Green Leaf Village dared to infuriate the Zhao family, this would be their outcome.A family such as the Liu\u2019s had reached such a state, what would theirs be in comparison? The genius produced from the Zhao family could threaten all the powers in the Green Leaf Village now.Solving this problem, Zhao Feng left the other small matters for Zhao Kayuan to deal with. Green Leaf Village was the place had he grown up in and he had deep emotions for this place.Now that he had enough strength, he was obviously going to protect it. Zhao Feng only stayed in the village for one day before he left.His will was the outside world, Green Leaf Village and Sun Feather City couldn\u2019t stop him.A few hours later, Zhao Feng arrived back at the main Zhao family. Tomorrow, he was going to leave this place and enter a brand new stage. But before he left, Zhao Feng still made the last preparations as packed his important items which included the thousand year blood plant, bamboo and spirit plant.Furthermore, there was still the silver bow which Zhao Feng decided to take, but unexpectedly, the high level decided to give him a better one.\u201cWe know that you\u2019re very talented with the bow, so we\u2019re going to give this \u201cGolden Stairs Bow\u201d to you. The bow is one of the weapons of our ancestors and only martial masters can use it\u2019s full power.\u201d Elder Zhao handed over a wooden box.Opening the box, a golden bow lay silently there. It\u2019s look was simple, but the string glowed faintly gold. Gently, he pulled the golden string, but he found that there was quite a bit of resistance. One had to know that Zhao Feng\u2019s Metal Wall Technique had reached the fifth level, so in strength alone he was even stronger than martial masters.Weng!The string trembled as he let go. He was certain that this Golden Stairs Bow had surpassed the Silver Bow in many grades.\u201cWhen did the family become so nice as to giving me silver and weapons?\u201d Although Zhao Feng said this he was still pleased with this bow.With the help of the Golden Stairs Bow, he could threaten the lives of cultivators of the seventh rank. That day, Zhao Feng stayed inside his room getting familiar with the bow. Within his mind, his Flowing Meteor Archery Skill merged with his mind. With Zhao Feng\u2019s enhanced vision, normal skills didn\u2019t come into his eyes at all.\u201cI need to fully merge all of the archery skills to be able to use half the potential of my left eye.\u201dZhao Feng had the first born advantage in archery, normal archery skills didn\u2019t help him at all. Obviously, he still needed a few days to merge all these archery skills together.The second morning.Both Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei arrived early. The two looked at each other and smiled. After the summit, the two now stood at the peak of Sun Feather City.Soon, the head of the sect arrived as well. Facing Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei, the elders were all very respectful because they knew their futures were unmeasurable. With their potential, they may be able to lead the Zhao family to a greater height.Shua!An azure blur appeared on the rooftop of the hall and a handsome man appeared. The person that came was Master Ye, but no one had seen how he came.\u201cZhao Feng, Zhao Yufei the three days have passed, you two will now come with me to the Guanjun Province City.\u201d Ye Linyun smiled faintly.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Yufei and Zhao Feng replied in unison.The man standing in front of them was one of the strongest people in the Cloud Country, the entire Zhao family had no chance against him.Ceng! Ceng!The two followed Ye Linyun and sat in a carriage that headed Northwards.Under the shadow of a tree outside of the Zhao family\u2019s gate.\u201cIt\u2019s better this way\u2026 With Yufei\u2019s potential and secret\u2026.\u201d A one armed old man sent the carriage away with his eyes.For the next few days, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei headed towards Guanjun Province City. The distance from Guanjun Province City and Sun Feather City took about four to five days on the carriage to travel. In this time, Zhao Feng merged the essence of the archery skills together to create his own skill.Because this skill was built on various skills and his left eye, he decided to name it \u201cArchery God\u2019s Left Eye\u201d. The Left Eye stood for for his own eye which came from an Ancient God. As time passed, the skill started to form.\u201cMy Archery God\u2019s Left Eye relies on the abilities of my left eye. The essence of the skill probably surpasses peak ranked martial arts.\u201d Zhao Feng estimated.Archery skills were quite rare, there wasn\u2019t any peak ranked archery skills in the Zhao family\u2019s martial arts library.On the journey, Ye Linyun spent most of his time cross legged, cultivating\u2026Zhao Feng sighed in his heart, he had reached the ninth rank already and he was still putting in so much effort.If the legendary Holy Martial Path was excluded, didn\u2019t that mean the ninth rank was the strongest?As if sensing Zhao Feng\u2019s gaze Ye Linyun opened his eyes: \u201cThere\u2019s still half a days time till we reach Guanjun Province City. Do you have any questions you want me to answer?\u201dAsking a Martial Master of the ninth rank questions?Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei saw the excitement in each other\u2019s eyes.\u201cWhat kind of realm is the Holy Martial Path?\u201d Zhao Feng asked.\u201cHoly Martial Path is the realm above the ninth rank, but since I haven\u2019t reached it I can\u2019t really tell you much about it. But according to the books, once someone reaches the Holy Martial Path, their bodies would undergo certain changes and their lifespans would increase. You could understand it as surpassing the limits of the human body.\u201d Ye Linyun answered.Surpassing the limits of the human body?Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but remember the Burning Wind Stance. The move seemed to engulf everything standing in it\u2019s way and a mortal body didn\u2019t seem able to unleash that kind of power.\u201d\u201cThose that reach the Holy Martial Path are all geniuses. You can count them with one hand in Cloud Country.\u201d A look of admiration appeared in Ye Linyun\u2019s eyes.Soon, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei both asked Ye Linyun more questions.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe nine ranks of the Martial Path train one\u2019s body starting from the skin to the organs. Therefore, it\u2019s best to set a solid foundation to have a better chance of reaching the Holy Martial Path.\u201d Ye Linyun emphasised.Zhao Feng kept this in his heart, he vaguely realised that the nine ranks of the Martial Path didn\u2019t seem to emphasise on killing or fighting.\u201cWe\u2019re almost there.\u201d The speed of the carriage started to slow down.At a certain point, a tiny black dot appeared within their sights.In Zhao Feng\u2019s vision, the black dot became bigger and bigger and soon, it turned into a magnificent city at least four or five times larger than Sun Feather City. It seemed like an enormous beast as it\u2019s gates engulfed the unlimited horses, carriage and people entering\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

According to Ye Linyun, the nine ranks of the Martial Path strived to perfect one\u2019s body. So as one reached the later ranks, the harder it was progress.The carriage soon entered the rich Province City.On the way, Zhao Feng realised that any random youth would have the cultivation of the third and fourth rank.The buildings here were far more majestic, it was not something Sun Feather City could be compared to. Finally, the carriage entered the depths of the city and stopped near a rich, noble palace. Compared to this, the Zhao family\u2019s mansion was just like an old bathroom, they weren\u2019t even close to being on the same level.Just the front gate alone was several carriages wide. What surprised them more was that the eight guards at the front gate had already reached the fourth rank or higher.\u201cCultivators of the fourth rank are only guards here?\u201d Zhao Feng was slightly dazed.Being born in a small village and cultivating to this level, he understood how much effort and pain it took. Martial Artists of the fourth rank or higher would even be respected in Sun Feather City.\u201cThis is the Guanjun Palace and it is the most influential place in the city. I\u2019ll soon transfer you guys to the \u201cSky Guards Battalion\u201d where we train our geniuses.\u201d Ye Linyun warned.Guanjun Palace! Sky Guards Battalion!The breathing rate of Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei increased. After entering the Guanjun Palace, Zhao Feng realised that almost every cultivator was of the fourth rank or higher. Zhao Feng even saw three Martial Masters of the seventh rank.Soon, Ye Linyun led the two to an old dirty field. It was weird that an old dirty field such as this would appear in the middle of the Guanjun Palace. On the field, there were a few tents and a low number of wooden rooms. Only in the very middle, there was a building.\u201cThis is the forbidden area of the Guanjun Palace \u2013 the Sky Guards Battalion\u201d, which was created by Lord Guanjun himself in the hope of raising some geniuses. At the same time, this is the backup of the Guanjun Corps.\u201d Ye Linyun walked forward.Sky Guards Battalion?We\u2019re going to live in this sh*tty place? Zhao Feng stared at the dirty muddy field with ten wooden rooms and a few more tents. The environment here was so cr*p that it wasn\u2019t even able to be compared with Green Leaf Village,\u201cHaha, Master Ye. These are the two geniuses you brought?\u201d A white bearded old man came from the other side with a black clothed youth following behind him.\u201cMaster Hu.\u201d Ye Linyun signalled to the white bearded old man.While they were speaking, Master Hu casually looked at Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei.Instantly, the two felt as if all their secrets had been exposed. Zhao Feng\u2019s heart shook, this old man\u2019s cultivation iwa probably even higher than Ye Linyun\u2019s.It could be seen that the Guanjun Palace did indeed have an unique position to see two Martial Masters of the ninth rank here.\u201cHe\u2019s Huang Qi, a genius I picked from the Pearl Tree City, just fifteen years old and already at the sixth rank.\u201d The old man smiled as he introduced the youth standing behind him with joy.Fifteen years old and already at the sixth rank. His talent was indeed good. The youth named Huan Qi casually glanced at Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei, but surprise was seen in his eyes as he looked at the latter\u2019s.Both the white bearded old man and Master Ye were in charge of sending their geniuses here. After they sent the three to the gate, the two Master\u2019s immediately stopped.\u201cI\u2019ll send you up to here. You better perform well because Lord Guanjun will be coming out of secluded meditation next month\u2026 \u201d Ye Linyun warned then left.Being a Martial Master of the ninth rank, his time was precious too.The white bearded old man also talked to Huang Qi: \u201cLord Guanjun is known for his love of geniuses, especially young ones. You need to grasp this chance to change your destiny.\u201d\u201cYes, Master Hu.\u201d Huan Qi took a deep breath and solemnly answered.Lord Guanjun was a legend in this country and the Sky Guards Battalion was created by him. If he stayed here and cultivated, not only would he receive resources from the Guanjun Palace he would also get the chance to see the legendary Lord Guanjun.The two from the Zhao family walked into the dirty fields with Huang Qi. On the way, they saw many youths of the same age. Most of them were between the ages of twelve and eighteen, but the majority were under sixteen. This meant that their ages were all similar.\u201cTwelve years old, third rank\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but click his tongue.The two children who had just walked past were both twelve years old and they had reached the third rank. One needed to remember that Zhao Feng didn\u2019t even step into the Martial Path when he was twelve.Furthermore, youths with fourteen and fifteen years of age could be seen everywhere and their cultivation were all at least of the fourth rank, with some even reaching the fifth and sixth rank. The scene turned the expression of the slightly arrogant Huang Qi solemn.\u201cThese three are probably new.\u201d The youths of the Sky Guards Battalion looked curiously at the three, but the majority of the gazes landed on Zhao Yufei.Zhao Yufei was beautiful and she had a pure angelic aura on her.\u201cLook, there\u2019s a beautiful girl genius here.\u201dFigures started to appear from within the Sky Guards Battalion. Looking at these new faces, sparks lit up within their eyes. Entering the Sky Guards Battalion, Zhao Feng and the other two all knew these were the geniuses across the country.\u201cIt should be here.\u201dThe three of them made their way to the center where the building was. As they had just entered the Sky Guards Battalion, they needed to come report here.\u201cAre you three new?\u201d A lazy voice sounded from behind.What!?Cold sweat appeared on Zhao Feng\u2019s back as he turned around and saw a silver clad youth there.The three jumped up in fear, when did the person appear? Soon, Zhao Feng realised that the clothes were familiar. He suddenly realised that on the day of the summit, there was a similar figure wearing the same silver outfit and he had injured the elder of the Qiu family.\u201cMy name is Third Guard and I am the supervisor of the Sky Guards Battalion. From today, you\u2019re a member of the Sky Guards Battalion\u2026 Now listen to the rules\u2026 \u201d The youths words were simple and short.The rules of the Sky Guards Battalion were strict.Firstly, every member could only leave once a month. Secondly, different people received different treatments. Thirdly, as long as no one was seriously injured/crippled/dead, you could do whatever you wanted.The first and third rules were easy to understand.But what did the second one mean?That afternoon, Zhao Feng understood the reason.There was only ten wooden rooms and thirty tents in the Sky Guards Battalion. Because the three had just arrived, they all received an old worn tent which the three could just fit perfectly in.\u201cWe\u2019re supposed to sleep here?\u201d Huang Qi tried to suppress his anger.The old worn tent could barely block the rain and wind; as for anything else it was completely useless. Being the genius of Pearl Tree City when did he receive such treatment?Zhao Feng scrunched his eyebrows, for him it was alright but Zhao Yufei was a woman and a pretty one too. This sh*tty tent couldn\u2019t even block most private parts.Zhao Yufei bit her lips, but she didn\u2019t say anything.\u201cOi, new kids, all you need to do to enter the wooden rooms is beat their original owners.\u201d A skinny youth walked over full of joy and warned.The three immediately turned their gazes to the ten wooden rooms.The rooms also had numbers one to ten on them. It was obvious that these ten were the elite of the elite.\u201cGood! All I need to do to get a wooden room is just beat the original owner.\u201d Huang Qi couldn\u2019t help but rub his hands together.He had complete confidence that with his sixth rank cultivation and being the top genius of Pearl Tree City, he could easily get a room.Dinner time.The few Guanjun guards brought the food to the youth in their tents.\u201cPeh! Pfff! What kind of food is this? It\u2019s like the food I feed my pigs!\u201d Huang Qi tasted some but immediately spat it out.It was just too disgusting.Zhao Feng chewed a bit and also spat it out. The food they had received had all gone old. But the three soon realised that the guards who to the wooden rooms had plates full of delicious, tasty food.\u201cFuck!\u201d Huang Qi cursed and stood up.It was obvious that the youths living inside the wooden rooms received better treatment.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cThe youths inside the wooden rooms are known as the \u201cTen Sky Guards\u201d. Where the rest of us eat leftover cr*p, they get to eat the wonders of the world and they have their own personal servants. Every month, we get two thousand one hundred pieces of silver, they get at least ten thousand and receive a variety of pills and resources. Apparently, if you become one of the Ten Sky Guards, there\u2019s a chance to receive pointers from Lord Guanjun himself\u2026. \u201d The skinny youth from before said unfairly and talked about the different treatments they received.Now, Zhao Feng fully understood the meaning of the second rule.Different people get different treatments.All that mattered here was strength, only through strength would you receive your respect.\u201cI want to challenge someone!\u201d Huang Qi howled as he threw the overdue food on the ground and sprinted in the direction of the wooden rooms.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The person with the worst potential here was already on par with Sun Feather City\u2019s Zhao Linlong.Soon, Huang Qi arrived in front of the ten wooden rooms, which had numbers according to their strength. The tenth owner was the tenth strongest and because it was Huang Qi\u2019s first time challenging someone, he obviously picked the guy at the end.\u201cHahaha\u2026 Who dares to challenge me, Li Changfeng?\u201d An arrogant laughter came from within the room.With a \u201ccreak\u201d, the door opened and a youth full of scars came out.Number ten Li Changfeng had only reached the peak fifth rank, but he was full of a menacing aura.\u201cHmph! A lowly fifth rank dares to be arrogant!\u201dOn the muddy field, the two faced off.\u201cArrogant or not, you\u2019ll soon know.\u201d Li Changfeng laughed and took out a pitch black sword with many holes on it, just like the scars on his body.\u201cStop talking and fight!\u201dHuang Qi\u2019s figure blurred as he used a high ranked martial art that had reached the peak level.\u201cThirteen Legs of the Willow!\u201d Huang Qi exclaimed as he performed another high ranked martial art of the peak level.Just these two skills alone made him dominate youths of the Pearl Tree City.Breaking Rock Sword!Li Changfeng\u2019s curved blade was sliced out and a dark red Inner Strength appeared on it. The level of that move had reached the max level!Peng!The two high ranked skills collided heavily together.Huang Qi \u201chmphed\u201d and retreated back a few steps.High ranked martial art\u2026 Max level?Huang Qi couldn\u2019t believe what he was seeing. Next to Zhao Feng, shock also appeared in Zhao Yufei\u2019s eyes.Splitting the Rocks!Li Changfeng attacked once again and his menacing aura became stronger and stronger\u2026Feathers of the Flying Bird!Under the pressure, Huang Qi used another skill which allowed him to just dodge the attack.\u201cHeavenly Rock Shatter!\u201d Li Changfeng shouted and in the night, that blade seemed as it could destroy the mountains.\u201cThe power of this move exceeds the original move.\u201d\u201cWhat a terrifying blow.\u201dThe hearts of the youths watching clenched. The menacing aura accompanied with his sword skill seemed to split the sky.Flying Wind Palm!At the point of danger, Huang Qi didn\u2019t hold back any longer and he suddenly used a peak ranked palm skill. The palm seemed to push away the clouds.Clang\u2014\u2014The energy clashed together and another hole was formed in the field.Wah!Huang Qi spat out a mouthful of blood midair and a red gash could be seen on his shirt. That move of Li Changfeng\u2019s was just too terrifying and it felt like it could slay anyone in it\u2019s way. Under the confrontation, Li Changfeng wasn\u2019t even injured; he only shook a little.\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei hurriedly picked up Huang Qi.\u201cHow could I lose\u2026 ?\u201cHuang Qi wasn\u2019t seriously injured but he was full of shock and disbelief. Being the top genius of Pearl Tree City and a cultivator of the sixth rank, how could he not even beat someone of the fifth?Being a spectator, Zhao Feng saw more clearly what had happened.Firstly, Li Changfeng had heaps of battle experience; this could be seen through all the scars on his body. Secondly, Li Changfeng\u2019s sword skill had reached an extremely high level. Combined with the terrifying aura, his moves seemed even more deadly. Many people had seen these two points but they didn\u2019t see the third.Li Changfeng\u2019s body was extremely strong and it was on par with the fourth level of Metal Wall Technique.\u201cStrong.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head.He and Zhao Yufei picked up Huang Qi in silence as they walked back.\u201cOi, new boy, you wanted to challenge the Ten Sky Guards with just your strength?\u201d\u201cHehe, he wasn\u2019t even able to exchange more than three moves with the Ten Sky Guards. It doesn\u2019t seem that the new people this time are very good.\u201d From the sides came laughter.The three had just entered the Sky Guards Battalion and they were counted as newbies. Under the midst of laughter, Zhao Yufei had caught the attention of many youths as well.\u201cHahaha! Pretty girl, if you feel your tent isn\u2019t comfortable, you can come to my room!\u201d Li Changfeng had just seen Zhao Yufei\u2019s beauty and he was entranced by it as well.The words caused the youths nearby the roar out in laughter. Zhao Yufei\u2019s face was cold and her fists were clenched, it was obvious that she was about to challenge him.\u201cYou\u2019re not his opponent!\u201d A powerful hand clasped her jade-like wrists.Zhao Feng had stopped her because his left eye had analysed the results. Although their cultivation were the same level, Li Changfeng had more battle experience and he was far more fiercer.If Zhao Yufei challenged Li Changfeng, she only had a maximum chance of forty percent to win.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Zhao Yufei\u2019s cheeks turned slightly red and although she seemed unwilling, she didn\u2019t struggle.\u201cZhe zhe, where did this brat come from?\u201dLi Changfeng licked his lips and the fierceness in his eye increased.\u201cLet\u2019s go!\u201d Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t be bothered and left the area while pulling Zhao Yufei\u2019s Hand.\u201cWant to leave?\u201d Li Changfeng turned into a whisp of wind and blocked their path.His high ranked speed skill had also reached the peak level.\u201cDo you want to fight?\u201d Zhao Feng coldly said.\u201cHahaha\u2026 don\u2019t you know the rules of the Sky Guards Battalion? As long as they\u2019re not seriously injured or crippled, you can fight all you want.\u201d Li Changfeng roared out in laughter.Sympathy was felt from the gazes of the youths nearby. Yes, the Sky Guards Battalion didn\u2019t forbid fighting. On the contrary, they promoted it.\u201cIt\u2019s better this way.\u201dDangerous light shone in Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes: \u201cWait Zhao Yufei, I\u2019ll get a room for you.\u201dHis words caused the youths nearby and Li Changfeng to stiffen, but after that came the laughter.\u201cBrother Feng\u2026 \u201cZhao Yufei seemed to be worried. Although she knew Zhao Feng was strong, she didn\u2019t have complete confidence that he could win.\u201dShua!The youth next to her suddenly disappeared and within the blink of an eye, he arrived in front of Li Changfeng.What speed!All the youths watching only felt a blur.\u201cMax level of a high ranked speed skill.\u201d Li Changfeng immediately used his full strength as well.After all his speed skill was only close to the max level, it hadn\u2019t reached it yet.Shua! Shua!As the two exchanged blows, it was obvious Zhao Feng had the upper hand.\u201cSplitting the Rocks!\u201d Li Changfeng\u2019s menacing blade once again appeared.This move had beaten back Huang Qi of the sixth rank just then.Under Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye, he realised that the opponent had purposely put part of his menacing aura into it to make the blade more fierce. This menacing aura could only be obtained by killing people, it was hard to wonder what kind of past this youth had.\u201cOne Line Star Finger!\u201d Zhao Feng exclaimed as he used his ultimate move.Sssss\u2014\u2014An azure light pierced through the air and clashed heavily with Li Changfeng\u2019s blade.Clang\u2014- Dang~Blood leaked from Li Changfeng\u2019s mouth as he retreated a few steps full of fear.How powerful was One Star Finger? It also had the power from Metal Wall Technique.Star Finger!Zhao Feng\u2019s finger left meteor streaks in the night and they were extremely beautiful. Li Changfeng managed to blocked five moves and although injuries started to appear, he didn\u2019t give up or admit defeat.\u201cWhat strong will.\u201d Although Zhao Feng admired him, he disliked his opponent\u2019s fierceness, so he didn\u2019t hold back.Ssss!Li Changfeng groaned in pain as his curved blade was kicked from his hand.Hua!Outrage broke out amongst the spectators. The all-time arrogant, fierce Li Changfeng had been beaten by a youth younger than him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cYou\u2019re very strong\u2026 I won\u2019t lose to you next time.\u201d Li Chanfeng picked himself up from the ground and took his possessions from the wooden room. This also meant that the room was not his anymore.\u201cHe won\u2026 \u201d Huang Qi stared dazed at the youth in front of him.The three had all entered the Sky Guards Battalion together and he hadn\u2019t put Zhao Feng in his eyes at the beginning.After beating Li Changfeng, Zhao Feng could finally move into the wooden room. The ten on his door meant that he was ranked tenth in the Ten Sky Guards.At this moment, Zhao Feng could feel the awe, respect and wariness in the gazes of those looking at him\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

It only had one bed and a table inside, but the difference between this and the tents were like a palace and bathroom.He thought about it and decided to give it to Zhao Yufei as she needed it more.\u201cThis is the room that Brother Feng won with his strength, I can\u2019t live in it. One day, I\u2019ll use my own strength to take it\u2026 \u201d Zhao Yufei bit her teeth and no matter how much Zhao Feng tried to persuaded her, she didn\u2019t agree.Furthermore, the rules said that only the Ten Sky Guards could enter, so Zhao Feng only helped build Zhao Yufei\u2019s tent next to his room.\u201cI hope that Brother Zhao can look after me a bit.\u201d Huang Qi\u2019s words were now far more respectful than before.The rules promoted fighting and those that were strong had the best treatment. Those that didn\u2019t have strong backgrounds would get beaten up. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t disagree and went back to his room to cultivate again. Ever since he reached the sixth rank, Zhao Feng felt the progress in his cultivation decrease. If he was able to go one step further, he would be a Martial Master which was an entire new level.He had never seen any Martial Masters under the age of forty in Sun Feather City.Two hours later, the green azure light was still six foot three in the dimension of his left eye.\u201cAccording to this speed, I still need at least a year to reach the seventh rank.\u201d Zhao Feng thought about it, then he took out his three one thousand year old plants.That night, he ate the thousand year blood plant. The thousand year blood plant was even useful for those of the seventh rank.After eating it, Zhao Feng immediately did his best to absorb the surges of energy. Because his Metal Wall Technique had reached the fifth level, his body was strong enough the withstand the energy of the thousand year blood plants. The merging of his left eye had also changed his body and his blood, so he was able to absorb more energy than others.Two hours later, Zhao Feng had absorbed most of the energy. Inside his left eye, the green light had reached six foot six.\u201cI\u2019ll be able to reach the late stages of the sixth rank once I take another one.\u201dZhao Feng thought about it but it wasn\u2019t good to continuously eat these resources as there was poison in them, which once overused would restrict their potential.On the second morning, Zhao Feng walked out of the room full of energy. Soon, there were servants sending food to him and they were very polite.According to the rules of the Sky Guards Battalion, Zhao Feng received ten thousand pieces of silver and a few pills. Fortunately, today was the last day of the month and Zhao Feng got these items.The ten thousand silver was just for the tenth Sky Guard, apparently the rank higher would receive one thousand silver more.The pills and resources he received were not much use for him since he had already reached the late stages of the sixth rank, so he decided to give some to Zhao Yufei.\u201cHehe, newbie, hand over half your items.\u201d From a wooden room not far away, a fairly handsome youth walked over.The youth was extremely clean and handsome, it was hard to believe he was one to say such words.\u201cNumber five of the Ten Sky Guards Lu Xiaoyun.\u201d\u201cLu Xiaoyun always takes resources from those ranked after him.\u201dThe youths nearby discussed it. Zhao Feng also inspected this Lu Xiaoyun. He was only fourteen, fifteen years old, not much older than Zhao Feng, but he had already reached the peak sixth rank.\u201cIf you have the ability to do so.\u201d Zhao Feng snickered.\u201cNewbie, don\u2019t think that you\u2019re good just because you beat Li Changfeng. Li Changfeng can\u2019t even exchange three moves with me.\u201d Lu Xiaoyu said slowly and when he looked at Zhao Feng, it was with his chin.Obviously in his eyes, Zhao Feng was the same as Li Changfeng, two little mosquitoes. There was a certain amount of difference in strength between every rank.\u201cWhat\u2019s that got to do with me?\u201d Zhao Feng sneered and walked away in the other direction.\u201cIf you want to fight, then do it. If not, then go away!\u201dWhat!?Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s expression turned dim. Zhao Feng\u2019s was looking down on him. Only he had ever looked down on others and he had received the same treatment today. The anger in his heart surged.\u201cHmph!\u201d Lu Xiaoyu turned into a blur and dissapeared.Hu!Zhao Feng only felt a small gust of wind come from his side; So fast!In the blink of an eye, Lu Xiaoyu had blocked Zhao Feng\u2019s path. To have such speed meant that his peak ranked speed skill had reached the high level.Lightly Micro Step!Zhao Feng left an afterimage behind as he dodged Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s attack.\u201cSeems like you\u2019re not that worthless!\u201dLu Xiaoyu was pretty shocked because his peak ranked martial art had reached the high level and apart from number one Feng Hanyue, no one could beat him in terms of speed. But he found out that Zhao Feng\u2019s high ranked speed skill had reached the max level and it\u2019s effect was even higher than his.Shua! Shua!The two figures intertwined, but none of them could beat the other.\u201cThunderbolt Fist!\u201dLu Xiaoyu suddenly used a peak ranked martial art and as he did so, the sky rumbled.Star Finger!Zhao Feng instantly used his Star Finger and at the same time, he pushed the power of his Metal Wall Technique near the fifth level. Even with all that, he still wasn\u2019t able to fully block the Thunderbolt Fist.Hong\u2014-The sound of Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s fists became louder and louder as his peak sixth rank cultivation had the upper hand. Zhao Feng had suppressed his cultivation to the peak fifth level, so he was unable to confront him straight on.Just as Zhao Feng was thinking if he should use some of his hidden strength.\u201cStop!\u201dA commanding voice came from the side. The owner of the voice was a bald headed youth with a robe of silver that shone under the sunlight.\u201cIt\u2019s number two Lei Cong.\u201d Fear appeared on the youth\u2019s faces.The two fighting also stopped.Zhao Feng clearly saw the wariness and fear inside Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s eyes. The bald headed youth had reached the peak sixth rank and he had touched the barrier of the seventh.He was number two of the Ten Sky Guards, Lei Cong. Facing him, both Zhao Feng and Lu Xiaoyu felt the pressure emitting from him.\u201cLei Cong, why did you stop our battle?\u201d Lu Xiaoyu questioned.Lei Cong shook his head: \u201cThe overseer has ordered the Ten Sky Guards to gather to discuss something.\u201dGathering of the Ten Sky Guards?Curiosity and shock appeared on everyone\u2019s faces. The Sky Guards Battalion never had had such a situation before. What did they want to discuss?Soon.Zhao Feng followed Lei Cong to the building at the center of the field. This was the one and only building on the field and at the same time, it was where the supervisor lived. Entering the building, there were already a few youths there and all of them had reached the sixth rank.The people present were all part of the Ten Sky Guards.\u201cWho\u2019s this brat?\u201d One or two youths seemed to reject Zhao Feng.\u201cHe beat Li Changfeng and became one of the Ten Sky Guards\u2026 \u201d Lu Xiaoyu said expressionlessly.He beat Li Changfeng? This brat was also one of the Ten Sky Guards?The youths present took back their cockiness.Soon, nine people including Zhao Feng arrived with Lei Cong having the strongest cultivation.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t Feng Hanyue coming?\u201d One person asked.\u201cEven though he\u2019s lazy, he should still be here.\u201dFeng Hanyue was the number one genius of the Ten Sky Guards.Just as they were questioning this, a beautiful youth with silver hair walked in.At first, Zhao Feng felt that this person was a girl, but the second the youth released his aura, Zhao Feng felt it the air become denser.Every action the beautiful youth made gave off a powerful aura as if his Inner Strength would come pouring out with just a thought.Ssss!Zhao Feng took in a cold breath.This Feng Hanyue had reached the seventh rank!The seventh rank!The other nine didn\u2019t dare look at Feng Hanyue in the eye.\u201cSo strong! He\u2019s not even sixteen and he is already a Martial Master.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng couldn\u2019t explain the shock. From the experience he had in Sun Feather City, most cultivators never broke through to the seventh rank and stayed at the peak sixth rank until they died.For example, although many of the so-called Ten Sky Guards were at the peak sixth rank, they may stay like this for tens of years or forever.One could see how hard it was to become a Martial Master, but someone in the Sky Guards Battalion had become one at only sixteen years old!As Feng Hanyue arrived, he casually scanned across the others and looked at the new face for a second more but didn\u2019t do anything.In his eyes, even geniuses such as Lei Cong and Lu Xiaoyun were nothing.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Everyone knew that Lord Guanjun had eighteen Guanjun Corps and they helped him in the darkness. Any one of them were Martial Masters and their strength was far more powerful than normal Martial Masters.The guard that had appeared on the summit that day was ranked seventeenth, but he had beaten the Qiu family elder in two moves. The Third Guard in front of them had even stronger strength.\u201cYou should all know that Lord Guanjun will come out of secluded meditation in one month.\u201d The guard\u2019s voice was simple, straightforward.Of course they knew!The youth\u2019s present nodded their heads full of expectancy. Lord Guanjun was a legend in the Cloud Country and he had already received the title \u201cUnbeatable\u201d, his fame even spread to neighbouring countries.\u201cThere\u2019s one piece of news I want to announce: When Lord Guanjun comes out, he will take in one or a few disciples out of you all.\u201d Envy appeared in his eyes as he said this.Lord Guanjun was taking in disciples?As soon as he finished his words, the youths flushed red with excitement. Many would die without regrets just to see Lord Guanjun and if they were able to receive pointers from him, that would be their dreams.But to become his disciple was something they never even dreamed about. After all, Lord Guanjun had a high authority in this country and he had apparently reached the Holy Martial Path\u2026Excitement shone on Zhao Feng\u2019s face, it looked like it was a good decision to come here. Here, he could interact with geniuses all over the country and he had the chance to see the legendary Lord Guanjun.\u201cThere\u2019s still one month! The Sky Guards Battalion is giving you a chance at actual combat.\u201d When he spoke, a smile appeared on his lips.Actual combat?The ten were all curious and expectant at the same time. Being at the Sky Guards Battalion, they had many chances to spar and fight. But they hadn\u2019t experienced many life and death situations.\u201cThere have been some bandits around lately with all of them at the fourth rank or higher. There\u2019s also suspicions of them being sent by our neighbouring country \u201cMaple Fire Country\u201d.Your mission is to eliminate these bandits, while protecting the nearby villages at the same time.\u201d Third Guard spoke.Bandits? Sent by neighbouring countries?Although they were curious, most of them were excited.\u201cSir Third Guard, why doesn\u2019t the Guanjun Palace just send their troops over and crush them?\u201d Lei Cong asked his suspicions.\u201cGood question!\u201d The man explained: \u201cThe bandits are extremely cunning as they don\u2019t always appear at the same place every time\u2026 They also sometimes pretend to be commoners\u2026 Anyways, the chance of eliminating them by sending our troops over is very low\u2026 Therefore, the Guanjun Palace has decided to give this chance to you youths.\u201dHearing this, Zhao Feng understood immediately.The Guanjun Palace gave this mission to them because they lacked combat experience.\u201cI hope that through, this your potential will be further revealed. The Guanjun Palace had set this up so for any bandit of the fourth rank you kill, you receive 1 battle point, for every fifth rank you kill you receive 2 battle points\u2026. If you\u2019re able to kill the leader, you get 20 battle points! Those that rank highest get extra rewards.\u201d Third Guard continued.\u201cMay I ask what do battle points do?\u201d One of the youths asked.\u201cYou can spend the battle points at the Treasury Hall where you can exchange it for Martial Arts, resources and weapons\u2026 for example 1 battle points can be exchanged for 1 five hundred year old blood plant, 10 battle points can get you a peak ranked martial art, 50 battle points can get you a half-Holy martial art.\u201d The man answered.Hearing this, the blood of the youth\u2019s boiled.Peak ranked martial arts! Half-Holy martial arts!All of them felt moved. Every one of them all had more or less one peak ranked martial art, but it was limited to either speed, defense, or offensive. Therefore, peak ranked martial arts were extremely precious for them.Although there was an incomplete Holy martial art in Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye, it\u2019s actual use wasn\u2019t even better than a Half-Holy martial art.Furthermore, battle points could be exchanged for weapons and resources.\u201cIt looks like the Guanjun Palace had decided to properly raise these geniuses. Just killing a few bandits alone can give you battle points which can be exchanged for such precious resources.\u201d Zhao Feng thought in his heart.He was extremely looking forward to this mission. The fact that he had his mysterious left eye gave him a better survival rate.\u201cThe mission starts 5 days from now, go and get ready!\u201d Third Guard then explained the details in depth more, then he gave the disbanding order.After the discussion was over, the news spread amongst the Sky Guards Battalion.The mission wasn\u2019t limited to just the Ten Sky Guards, but the Ten Sky Guards led the squads. For the next few days, the members of the Sky Guards Battalion started to form teams in accordance to how the rewards were split.Some of the strongest teams included Lei Cong\u2019s and Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s in which all the people were of the fourth rank or higher.Obviously, there were still people going solo such as Feng Hanyue, the number one of the Ten Sky Guards.Feng Hanyue was the only Martial Master, therefore his strength alone beat a team\u2019s.Because Zhao Feng had just arrived, he formed a team with Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi, but the strength of his team was incomparable to Lei Cong\u2019s and Lu Xiayu\u2019s. However, Zhao Feng had confidence that his battle points would still be one of the top.As the mission was just a few days away, Zhao Feng ate one of the other thousand year plants.Three days later.The green ray of light in the dimension of his left eye had reached six foot nine.At this time, Zhao Feng still had one more plant, but he didn\u2019t use it because:Firstly, continuous use of resources meant that the effect would decrease. Secondly, Zhao Feng would rather save it for the critical moment when he would be trying to reach the seventh rank.\u201cMy cultivation is at the late stages of the sixth rank, but there\u2019s still a bit of distance to the peak.\u201dZhao Feng thought in his heart.Therefore, he became even more expectant of the mission as one\u2019s potential would be fully unleashed through life and death battles. In the blink of an eye, the five days given to prepare passed.Another surprising thing was that Zhao Yufei had broken through to the sixth rank two days ago with the help of Zhao Feng\u2019s resources.Morning.All the youths of the fourth rank or higher split into small teams and left the Guanjun Palace. The group of three formed up by Zhao Feng, Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi were also in it.\u201cBrother Feng, is your real cultivation only at the peak fifth rank?\u201d Zhao Yufei asked her suspicions.Back in the Zhao family, she clearly knew how fast Zhao Feng progressed, but she had reached the sixth rank already. So how could Zhao Feng still be at the peak fifth rank?Hearing this, Huang Qi was also interested.\u201cYou\u2019re right, this isn\u2019t my real cultivation.\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t hide it either and released his true aura.Peak sixth rank!Both Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi felt the pressure bearing towards them. Zhao Feng\u2019s aura was extremely dense and heavy, it brought more pressure than other peak sixth ranks.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euAfter he released his aur, Zhao Feng hid it once more, suppressing it to the beginning of the sixth rank, the same as Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi.Zhao Feng showed his teammates his true strength to gain more trust. Now that he hidden it away, he could do sneak attacks in the battles coming. The three left the Guanjun Province City and they arrived at its borderline after a few days of travel. This area was complicated with many trees, rivers, streams, cliffs and a few villages around, but this place was also the only path that lead towards Maple Fire Country, so the bandits could have been sent by them.\u201cOnce we leave this village, we\u2019ll be entering the danger area where the bandits lurk.\u201d Zhao Feng opened up his map and discussed with Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi.\u201cHehe, Lady Yufei, do you have the interest to join my team?\u201d A clear arrogant laughter sounded.Zhao Feng and the other two turned around and found Lu Xiaoyu leading a team of seven to eight people passing by.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

There were three to four members of the fourth rank and the rest were all peak fifth ranks.Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s face was full of smiles as he inspected Zhao Yufei, there was no one that didn\u2019t know her in the Sky Guards Battalion.\u201cThanks for your offer but I already have my own team.\u201d Zhao Yufei expressionlessly rejected Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s offer.Rejected?Didn\u2019t this girl like the strong?Lu Xiaoyu was slightly surprised. He was handsome enough and adding the fact that he was extremely talented, which girl would reject him?\u201cWith the strength of you three, you\u2019d be hard pressed to even fend for yourselves.\u201d Lu Xiaoyu glanced at Zhao Feng and Huang Qi with disdain.\u201cThanks for your care but my team have our own ways to survive, we\u2019ll speak with our Battle points later.\u201d Zhao Feng said calmly.\u201cBattle points? Hahaha\u2026 you think a group like yours can be compared to ours?\u201d The youth of the peak sixth rank had tears of laughter in his eyes.He was \u201cLi Ziwen\u201d, ranked seventh within the Ten Sky Guards.\u201cGo!\u201dZhao Feng didn\u2019t bother with their team and he lead Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi into the danger zone. Soon, they met a few other teams led by the Ten Sky Guards.Lei Cong\u2019s team was even stronger with tens of people and two of the Ten Sky Guards. Facing such a setup, Huang Qi became a little uneasy.\u201cBrother Zhao, are you sure we\u2019ll be able to get some battle points?\u201dHuang Qi couldn\u2019t help but ask. In terms of number, they had only three people, if they were unlucky and met a group of ten bandits, they\u2019ll face the danger of being eliminated.\u201cRelax, you battle points won\u2019t be low.\u201dZhao Feng was fully confident: \u201cIf you don\u2019t believe me, you can go join another team.\u201dLooking at the confident expression on Zhao Feng\u2019s face, Huang Qi\u2019s suspicions fell down a bit.Half an hour later.The three entered the danger zone.The landscape of this area was complex, but Zhao Feng didn\u2019t even look back as he passed through. Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi had to take the map time after time to see if they were on the right track, but Zhao Feng didn\u2019t need to as the map had already been photocopied into his mind and with the magnifier of his left eye, he could see the \u201creal view\u201d.\u201cBrother Zhao, where are we going?\u201d Huang Qi felt dizzy as he looked at the map.\u201cThere\u2019s a stream up there, next to the canyon. Water and food is a must for these bandites\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng said without hesitation.Soo,n a river appeared and not far away there was indeed a canyon. Huang Qi couldn\u2019t help but click his tongue, he never thought that Zhao Feng\u2019s memory was so good and he had perfectly synchronised the map with the real landscape.\u201cWe\u2019ll ambush here. Huang Qi, you go hide in the river, Yufei you go hide between the rock near the entrance of the canyon.\u201d Zhao Feng soon gave the order.Zhao Yufei didn\u2019t have any suspicions and she hid between the rocks. Huang Qi hesitated for a bit, but he still jumped into the river.Ceng!Zhao Feng jumped onto a tree and took his Golden Stairs Bow out and aimed it in the direction of the canyon. In reality, he had already seen suspicious people coming from the canyon with his left eye.A while later.From the direction of the canyon came the sound of footsteps and a few men dressed as commoners appeared. There was a total of three people with the leader reaching the peak fifth rank and on his left and right were two others at the fourth and fifth rank respectively.The three came next to the river nd began to drink.\u201cAttack!\u201dZhao Feng pulled the string and let an arrow loose. The bow trembled as a golden arrow pierced through the sky and made a perfect arc.Ahhhhh!The arrow lodged itself in the skinny man\u2019s shoulder and he fell down with a \u201cplop\u201d.\u201cAmbush!\u201d The leader yelled as he surveyed his surroundings.Hua!At this moment, a youth appeared from the stream.Cloud Defying Palm!Huang Qi attacked from the side and collided with the leader\u2019s attack head on.Pah\u2014\u2013Because it was unexpected, the leader received some light injuries.Thirteen Legs of the Willow!Huang Qi attacked while he had the advantage with his peak level high ranked martial art.\u201cMa San, I\u2019ll come help you!\u201d The last man attacked from the side.Sou\u2014\u2013But just at this moment, another arrow pierced through the air and scraped past the fat person\u2019s clothes.So close!The fat man did a flip and just managed to dodge the arrow.\u201cWatch out for the archer in the dark!\u201d The skinny man moaned in pain, the arrow before had hit one of his acupuncture points, so he couldn\u2019t use any inner strength.\u201cYou guys retreat and report the situation.\u201d The leading man spoke to the fat one as he blocked one of Huang Qi\u2019s moves.\u201cYou be careful Ma San!\u201d The fat person immediately turned around and ran back the way he came from.Where are you running!?From the rocks came out a beautiful girl and blocked the fat man\u2019s path.Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi both engaged the enemies. Huang Qi\u2019s opponent had reached the peak fifth rank and he was very experienced with many hidden moves. Zhao Yufei\u2019s opponent had trained some sort of body strengthening technique, which gave him extreme strength.Zhao Feng stood in the trees, one hand on his bow but he didn\u2019t attack because he had considered the fact that the other two had no experience in life and death battles.These two bandits were full of tricks and although their cultivation was lower, they didn\u2019t lose immediately.Around ten moves later.Spiritual Wind Slice!Zhao Yufei used her peak ranked martial art and managed to knock the fat man out. The enemy that Huang Qi faced was slightly harder and he was only defeated after twenty moves.Teng!Only at this time did Zhao Feng come out from the trees.\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you attack?\u201d Huang Qi was slightly irritated.Zhao Feng had only shot out the first two arrows then he didn\u2019t support them at all.\u201cYou two need to think about how you fight, you spent way too much time defeating others with lower cultivation than you.\u201d Zhao Feng said calmly.\u201cYou\u2026 \u201cHuang Qi wanted to rebuke him, but he couldn\u2019t think of anything to say, the opponent had too many tricks up his sleave and he would\u2019ve lost if it wasn\u2019t because he had the advantage in Martial Arts and cultivation.\u201cBrother Feng\u2019s right, we lack combat experience.\u201d Zhao Yufei nodded her head in agreement.Next.The three scavenged the items off the bandits\u2019 bodies and found various items such as poisonous medicine, hidden blades etc.\u201cForgive me!\u201d The one that had been shot first bowed down repeatedly.Puh!Zhao Feng stabbed his throat with one finger.\u201cTake care of one each.\u201d Zhao Feng glanced towards Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi.These two were geniuses and they were protected by their families ever since they were young, so they had virtually no experience in combat or killing.Huang Qi hesitated for a while, but clenched his teeth and finished off the leader. If he didn\u2019t kill the leader, he couldn\u2019t get any battle points.But Zhao Yufei was after all a girl, so unwillingness appeared on he face.\u201cPlease don\u2019t kill me, beautiful Lady.\u201d The fat bandit screamed sadly which made her unable to kill him.Zhao Feng only laughed coldly, but he didn\u2019t say anything.Metal Eagle Claw!Light shone in the bandits\u2019 eyes as his figure suddenly pounced towards Zhao Yufei with his hand heading straight towards her throat.The sudden change drained the color on Zhao Yufei\u2019s face.Spiritual Wind Slice!Her jade like hands waved and the head of the bandit fell off.Both Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi felt like vomiting after their first kill, only Zhao Feng\u2019s face was the same as usual. He was slightly shocked as he remembered that he didn\u2019t have such reactions when he first killed someone.Back at the Sky Cloud Forest, Zhao Feng was extremely calm during the assassination. After he thought about it, Zhao Feng had to give the credit to his left eye.Their first battle was victorious and both Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi learnt heaps. On the same day, the three continued to stay around the same area but they would change positions.When afternoon arrived, the team of three had defeated a total of seven people, four of the fifth rank and three of the fourth rank.After the battles, both Huang Qi and Zhao Yufei made major improvements and the teamwork between them was much better. Zhao Feng secretly nodded his head, it finally seemed better.\u201cTonight, we\u2019ll go to the interior of the canyon. According to my analysis, there a high possibility of a bandit headquarters\u2019 there, which may still have some people left.\u201d Zhao Feng once again gave each of them a task.The first task was gathering news, which Zhao Feng decided to do himself. With his powerful left eye, he wasn\u2019t only a born archer, he was also a born scout too. In the time it takes to boil a pot of water, Zhao Feng had gone and come back.\u201cCome.\u201d This was all Zhao Feng said as he led Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi to the interior of the canyon.On the way, Zhao Feng kept going through the paths where the bandits wouldn\u2019t see them. This gave Huang Qi a feeling that could all the bandits have already died?Soon.Zhao Feng, Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi hid behind a massive rock.\u201cThere\u2019s bandits inside the wooden room and the cave over there.\u201d Zhao Feng said to the two.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHaha, we\u2019re ambushing again? How many of them are there and how strong are they?\u201dHuang Qi rubbed his hands together, they had ambushed so many people today that he was fully confident they would win.\u201cOne person of the peak sixth rank, two normal sixth rank, three fifth ranks, five fourth ranks\u2026 a total of eleven.\u201d Zhao Feng reported.What? Eleven?Huang Qi\u2019s eyes bulged out as his cheek muscle twitched: \u201cAre you crazy? That is a nest of bandits, run!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

That is a nest of bandits, run!\u201dHuang Qi almost turned insane, his eyes were full of anger and he wanted to curse Zhao Feng\u2019s entire family.These eleven fierce, deadly bandits weren\u2019t something that the youths could compare to. The three sixth rankers alone would be troublesome for them and there still were many cultivators of the fourth and fifth rank.\u201cBrother Feng, it\u2019s too dangerous\u2026 You\u2019re not joking right?\u201dZhao Yufei was shocked, through the encounters they had with the bandits, they understood their deadly methods.\u201cRun! Retreat! We can still do it now!\u201d Huang Qi\u2019s heart felt like it was on fire.If they were found by the bandits, they would receive an unimaginable destiny\u2026.Zhao Yufei\u2019s face was extremely pale and subconsciously gripped his hand: \u201cWhy did you bring us here if you knew this place was full of bandits?\u201d\u201cBe quiet, there\u2019s eleven bandits here but they\u2019re not together. You just have to follow my plan and we\u2019ll destroy them all\u2026 \u201cZhao Feng\u2019s tone was very calm.\u201cI\u2019m not listening to you, I wanna run away\u2026 \u201c Huang Qi\u2019s heart was cold with fear.At this moment, they could already see the figures moving around the wooden rooms through the cracks of the rocks.\u201cBrother Shi! The brothers that went to hunt aren\u2019t back yet.\u201d A blockhead of the sixth rank called.\u201cThey\u2019re probably never going to come back then if they haven\u2019t returned in two hours\u2026 \u201d Within the room came a deep sound from a middle aged man.\u201cBe on alert! I fear that the enemy might have followed the trails to here.\u201d The voices could be heard by the three hiding behind the rocks.\u201cHehe looks like there\u2019s no way back, so you have to listen to my plan.\u201d Zhao Feng gave a faint smile.Huang Qi grinded his teeth; he now hated Zhao Feng because he knew the latter had planned for this to happen.\u201cI\u2019ll listen to Brother Feng.\u201d Instant trust could be seem in Zhao Yufei\u2019s eyes.Damn it!Huang Qi\u2019s heart dropped as Zhao Yufei agreed, if a lady like her wasn\u2019t even scared, then how could he?\u201cYou two go over and finish off the fourth and fifth ranks fast, but don\u2019t fight against the sixth ranks, especially the middle aged peak sixth rank leader\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng told them the plan.\u201cSo what are you doing when we go over?\u201d Huang Qi asked suspiciously.\u201cI\u2019ll be behind you two\u2026 Supporting you!\u201d Zhao Feng gave a smile.No sh*t!Huang Qi almost didn\u2019t curse out loud, while Zhao Yufei and he were going to kill the enemy this guy, the leader of the team was going to hide behind them?How could he do this? No way!What would happen if Zhao Feng ran away because he saw that they were too hard to deal with?\u201cOk, it\u2019s settled then.\u201d As soon as he finished his words, Huang Qi was pushed out with a \u201cpah\u201d.Ah!Huang Qi screamed and his figure was seen. At this moment, he had cursed all of Zhao Feng\u2019s ancestors.\u201cKill!\u201dHe had nowhere to go so he attacked towards the bandits near the wooden rooms.Who\u2019s there!?The bandits nearby soon found the two.\u201cCome! Enemy attack\u2026 \u201dSounds of fighting rang.Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi attacked the bandits of the fourth and fifth rank. According to Zhao Feng\u2019s plan, they had to kill them fast. Once they were held up by them, the stronger ones would arrive and they would be killed for sure.Under this pressure, the two\u2019s battle power exceeded what they usually had.Ahh!The instant the two forces clashed together, a fourth ranker and fifth ranker were slain.Sou\u2014-At the same time, Zhao Feng stood on top of the big rock and released an arrow.Plop!A peak fifth rank cultivator fell to the ground. What was shocking was that this arrow perfectly stopped he attack that Zhao Yufei was about to face from behind her.\u201cBrats, you dare to attack us! Don\u2019t think that any one of you will leave today!?\u201dA bulk, muscular middle aged man walked out of the wooden room and led the other two sixth ranks over.Huang Qi and Zhao Yufei instantly felt the pressure emitting from them. The middle aged man\u2019s aura was even stronger, it was on par with the top five Ten Sky Guards or even the top three.Sou Sou Sou!Three arrows pierced through the air and headed straight at the three sixth ranks.Dang!The leader used his blade to block the arrow, but the other two sixths ranks next to him had been slightly injured.\u201cThis Golden Stairs Bow is indeed not bad. I\u2019ve only used seventy to eighty percent of my strength and I haven\u2019t put any Inner Strength in it.\u201d Zhao Feng had a faint smile on his face.Every time he released an arrow, a bandit would fall. At the same time, both Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi became engaged in a tough battle but Zhao Feng supported them from behind, so they didn\u2019t reach a desperate state.\u201cI\u2019ll leave the boy and girl to you, I\u2019ll go get the archer\u2026 \u201d The middle aged bandit leader immediately saw that Zhao Feng was the most threatening one.Zhao Feng steadily pulled out three arrows and shot them at the three sixth ranks again.Dang! Dang! Dang!The three sixth ranks once again blocked Zhao Feng\u2019s attack, but it gave Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi time to take a breath.When the middle aged man reached Zhao Feng, there were only four to five bandits left. Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi were both in an extremely dangerous situation.Water Wave Slash!The leading bandit\u2019s sword seemed like the sea as waves after waves of power surged through it. His sword level had almost reached the max level and the skill was almost at the peak rank too.\u201cOpen!\u201dZhao Feng waved his Golden Hair Bow with the addition of strength from his Metal Wall Technique.Dang~The force sent the middle aged bandit back a few steps. The casual swipe of the Golden Stairs Bow not only contained power from Metal Wall Technique, it also had an unspeakable aura as if it became one with it\u2019s surroundings.\u201cHehe.\u201dZhao Feng gently smiled, then he jumped into the air and pulled the string of his bow.Sou!An arrow went straight into the chest of a bandit near the wooden houses. At the same time, the arrow managed to resolve the desperate situation Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi were in. Although Zhao Feng killed one, Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi still faced four bandits including two of the sixth rank.\u201cHm, it\u2019s about right.\u201dZhao Feng didn\u2019t think of helping the two any further and the middle aged leader wouldn\u2019t let him do so as well.\u201cStar Finger!\u201dZhao Feng exclaimed as he put the bow away and engaged the middle aged bandit in close combat.The opponent\u2019s strength had reached the peak sixth rank and he had unlimited hidden moves. Normal sixth rankers might not even be able to block one move of his.Zhao Feng found that when he used Star Finger to the peak third level, he still couldn\u2019t gain the upper hand, but his advantage was obvious too. The fifth level of the Metal Wall Technique also had a small rebound which fended off the furious attacks of the enemy.But the middle aged man didn\u2019t run! With his battle experience, he knew that if he ran, he had a lower survival rate.Firstly, Zhao Feng was a godly archer and to run in front of one was retarded. Secondly, Zhao Feng\u2019s speed was faster than his.The middle aged man decided to engage in close combat and put some hope in his comrades to finish the two brats off and support him here.Both Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi had a hard time as they faced two sixth rankers, one fourth rank and one fifth rank, but they were geniuses after all. Under the pressure, they became more accustomed to it and steadily regained their composure.Ahh!Soon, the cultivator of the fourth rank was slain by Zhao Yufei, which let them have a slight break as they only had to face one fifth rank and two sixth ranks now. But their expressions turned serious once more as they looked in the direction of Zhao Feng.If it were any one of them apart from Zhao Feng, they probably couldn\u2019t even exchange up to twenty moves.One Line Star Finger!Zhao Feng\u2019s move this time reached the edges of the fourth level.Shua~A deep gash was left on the middle aged bandit, but that made him go insane which propelled him to attack more powerfully without consideration for his own injuries.The leader was putting his life on the line and he even headed towards the path of perishing together.The determination he had would make most opponents wary, but Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t normal; he still remained calm as he opened his left eye.Ten moves later, the injuries on the middle aged bandit became heavier and an error was finally found by Zhao Feng.Plop!The bandit fell to the ground and before he could struggle, a finger pierced through his heart.\u201cThese bastards still have some skills.\u201d Zhao Feng let out a breath.The battle between Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi also came to an ending. They knew that Zhao Feng would most likely not help, so they used their killing moves and finally killed the last three bandits remaining.Sou!Zhao Feng slew the one bandit trying the run away with his bow.Hu~Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHuang Qi and Zhao Yufei fell to the ground exhausted, but joy and happiness could be seen in their eyes.The nest of eleven bandits had been cleared! The almost impossible mission had been finished.The two looked at Zhao Feng full of admiration and awe because they knew this was Zhao Feng\u2019s plan and he had played an important role in supporting them.At the same time.Behind a rock a few hundred yards away, a silver figure hiding there took in a cold breath: \u201cThese three brats took down a whole nest! Six of the eleven bandits, including that peak sixth rank bandits who had been killed by the youth named Zhao Feng\u2026 \u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi had both received some injuries, only Zhao Feng remained unharmed, which made the other two realise the gap between them.What shocked them more was that Zhao Feng had only used the power of the early stages of the sixth rank to kill the leading bandit and not the peak of the sixth rank. It could be seen that Zhao Feng\u2019s strength was at the Quasi-Martial Master rank at least!The three cleared the battlefield and then divided the battle points. Because Zhao Feng had killed the leader, it wasn\u2019t the main leader, so it was only worth five battle points. There was a total of six who were killed by Zhao Feng, they included two fourth ranks, two fifth ranks and two sixth ranks.Adding them on the previous ones, Zhao Feng\u2019s battle points had reached over twenty points. And according the the rules, ten points could be exchanged for a peak ranked martial art.Half an hour later.\u201cWe should leave now, it\u2019s not good to stay here for so long.\u201d Zhao Feng ordered as he was the team captain.\u201cYes.\u201d Huang Qi and Zhao Yufei both agreed immediately, they now trusted Zhao Feng completely.Teng! Ceng! Ceng!The three increased their speed and soon, they left the canyon.Two hours later after the three left.Three black figures flew across the dark sky and landed in front of the wooden room.\u201cLeader, the eleven men including Shi Badao have died with half of them succumbing to an archer.\u201d The voice of one of the black shadows was cold and expressionless.\u201cWho dare touch my \u201cDesolate Destruction Bandits!?\u201d One of the figures slowly lifted his palm and a powerful air wave ripped everythingin a radius of several meters.The two black figures felt the pressure, although they weren\u2019t any weaker than the middle aged man that just died.Hong!The bulky figure waved his hand and the houses in front collapsed. At that moment, the aura from the bulky figure was on par with high tier deadly beasts.\u201cLord Desolate!\u201d The other two quasi-Martial Masters\u2019 heart jumped.\u201d\u201cFind out the killer, I\u2019ll dish back to them what they did to my men ten times stronger!\u201d The angry, cold voice sounded in the wind.\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026.At the same time.Mysterious youths, who were split into teams, took the lives of bandits. Everyone from the Sky Guards Battalion had extreme potential. Under this environment, they grew stronger quickly but there were also casualties as well.Apart from those in the Ten Sky Guards, seven to eight silver figures merged into the night to calculate the total battle points. At night, Zhao Feng\u2019s eyesight was still perfect, but considering the fact that botg Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi were tired, he decided not to attack. The three found a pretty secure place where they decided to rest with no bandits around.The second day.The team of three once again started looking for bandits.\u201cEh? What\u2019s going here? Why are there less and less bandits around?\u201d Zhao Feng soon found a problem.They had scouted around for a long time and instead of meeting bandits, they met other teams.Huang Qi said deeply: \u201cIt must be because the Sky Guards Battalion killed too many bandits last night and the others have hidden themselves.\u201dZhao Feng nodded his head and found this thought very logical. If those bandits hid in the mountains, it would be hard to find them even with his left eye.\u201cWe have to go in deeper.\u201d Zhao Feng still led the way.At times, he would jump onto trees and survey their surroundings.Suddenly.Tens of miles away, a rainbow colored smoke appeared which attracted his attention.\u201cIt\u2019s the emergency signal from another team!\u201d Zhao Yufei exclaimed.Go to the rescue!Zhao Feng was the first one to sprint off in the direction, but his expression changed as he opened his left eye. The group that was in danger was Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s. The seven to eight youths of the Sky Guards Battalion were surrounded by a group of fifteen bandits.There were two black clothed bandits that had reached the quasi-Martial Master rank and three third ranks, while the rest were at the fourth and fifth.At this moment, both sides were battling each other, but the youths couldn\u2019t charge out. Luckily, a group of four that were nearby raced over giving them a bit of hope.Sou\u2014 Sou\u2014 Sou\u2014But right at this moment, three or four bandit archers hiding in the forest shot their arrows.Ahh!A few of the Sky Guards Battalion members were injured.Cloud Swaying Fist!Lu Xiaoyu forced the bandits back with his peak ranked martial art, which had been trained to the peak level. But he couldn\u2019t kill them as one of the quasi-Martial Masters was keeping him busy.\u201cBoss! There\u2019s three more brats coming.\u201d An archer in hiding in the woods told the two black clothed figures.The three that came were Zhao Feng\u2019s team.Through his left eye, Zhao Feng analysed the straightest path and gradually closed in. When he was within one hundred yards, Zhao Feng suddenly stopped and took out his bow.Sou\u2014\u2013 Sou\u2014 Sou\u2014Zhao Feng continuously pulled his bow and perfectly shot the archers hiding in the woods giving Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s team time to get in a few breaths.Kill!The bandits and the youths engaged in battle. With Zhao Feng and the other team joining in, the Sky Guards Battalion side gradually had the advantage. The youths became braver and braver as time went on.\u201cA bunch of brats! All of you stay!\u201d A deep cold voice resounded from the forest.Shua!A great pressure came from the other side of the forest, which made the heart of the youths jump. The owner of the voice wad an one-eyed man wearing a black cloak.\u201cNot good, it\u2019s a Martial Master!\u201d Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s face turned pale as his heart twitched.The person coming was the boss of bandits.\u201cBrat! Die\u2026 \u201c The one-eyed man flew over and his aura made the youths unable to breath.Breaking Wind Palm!With a sound as loud as thunder, the palm headed straight towards Lu Xiaoyu.\u201cEveryone, block it!\u201d Lu Xiaoyu exclaimed and he combined forces with Li Ziwen to block he attack.Peng\u2014-The explosion caused a wave of air that pushed through everything in it\u2019s path including Li Ziwen and Lu Xiaoyu, who were sent seven to eight metres back.Wah!The two who had taken the hit head on, Lu Xiaoyu and Li Ziwen, both spat out a mouthful of blood. These two were ranked fifth and seventh in the Ten Sky Guards and their strength were around the quasi-Martial Master, but even the two quasi-martial masters, with the help of many other sixth ranks, weren\u2019t able to block this one move.\u201cZhao Feng, Lu Chen! Come and help!\u201d Lu Xiaoyu shouted and asked for help from Zhao Feng and the leader of the other group.The teams were all led by at least one of the Ten Sky Guards and at this time, including Zhao Feng and Lu Chen there were five of the ten Sky Guards Present.Beng\u2014-Zhao Feng pulled the string of his bow from far away and he put his Inner Strength into it, the power of this arrow could harm the lives of quasi-Martial Masters.Illusion Wind Blade!The other leader used his max level high ranked martial art and attacked from the back.Cloud Shattering Fist!Lu Xiaoyu immediately used a fist skill, while Li Ziwen next to him used a sword.The attack of the five great geniuses reached the one-eyed man.\u201cWhere did these geniuses come from?\u201d The one-eyed man exclaimed and at the same time, he circulated his chaotic Inner Strength.Blang!The arrow of Zhao Feng\u2019s snapped into pieces.Dong\u2013 Dong\u2014 Dong\u2014All the attacks were blocked and once again, they were sent flying.\u201cWhat strength!\u201dZhao Feng was pretty shocked.A Martial Master could release his Inner Strength and create long range attacks. If any one of them was to face one alone, they might lose their lives in two moves.At this time both Lu Xiaoyu and Li Ziwen received light injuries. The Inner Strength from Martial Masters of the Seventh rank could strike like lightning and instantly turn those of the fourth and fifth rank into dust.Only Zhao Feng didn\u2019t need to fight close combat as he pulled his bow repetitively and every arrow would fly towards the smallest flaws of the one-eyed man.The full power of Zhao Feng shooting his arrows threatened the movement of the one-eyed bandit.\u201cBastard! It looks like the one that killed my men in the canyon was you\u2026 \u201c The one-eyed man suddenly turned around with killing intent in his eyes.\u201cSo what if it was me?\u201d Zhao Feng laughed coldly.\u201cKill!\u201dThe bandit didn\u2019t bother with the attacks from the other youths and headed straight at Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng jumped up in fright and he immediately circulated Lightly Floating Ferry to escape.\u201cDon\u2019t run!\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe one-eyed man still came close and close though because he was a Martial Master and therefore, he was faster.\u201cShattering Mountain Palm\u2026 \u201dThe palm of the Martial Master shot through the air and headed towards Zhao Feng. If it was another cultivator of the same rank just the Inner Strength alone could kill him, but Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t normal.Mysterious Wind Palm!Zhao Feng flipped around midair and in his mind, the image of the palm from that girl appeared. He then took a deep breath as an azure glow formed on his palm and then the two heavily collided with each other.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Zhao Feng had only learnt a bit of it, but after training the four incomplete Holy martial arts, he found that it was easier. In terms of power alone, Mysterious Wind Palm wasn\u2019t stronger than Star Finger but it suppressed the other skills in terms of profoundness and adding on the fact that he had reached the fifth level of Metal Wall Technique, he was able to retreat safely.Zhao Feng\u2019s performance gained cheers from the other geniuses. To be able to take a hit from a Martial Master and retreat unharmed was a great feat.\u201cYou can\u2019t run away boy, I only used sixty percent of my strength just then.\u201d The voice from the one eyed bandit echoed from behind.But Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t fighting alone, there were others from the Ten Sky Guards helping and soon, a gap formed between the two which allowed Zhao Feng once again to pull his bow.Sou! Sou! Sou!This time, Zhao Feng used his Archery\u2019s God\u2019s Left Eye skill, which made the arrows arc perfectly towards the bandit leader.What!The one-eyed bandit found that the arrows swayed with wind and broke through the weakest part of his defenses.Shua!One of the arrows left a deep gash on his shoulder. This scene improved the moral of the Sky Guards Battalion.\u201cThat guy\u2019s an archer!\u201d Lu Xiaoyu and co. stopped for a second, then they resumed their attacks.Ceng! Ceng! Ceng\u2026At this time, another team appeared and it looked like it was even stronger than Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s team.\u201cIt\u2019s Lei Cong\u2019s team!\u201dAlthough they were pretty far away, the bald headed silver figure could still be seen. Lei Cong was ranked second in the Ten Sky Guards and he had almost reached the seventh rank.\u201cRetreat!\u201d The bandit leader gave the order immediately.His side was already struggling right now and with the addition of another even stronger team, they had no chance at all.\u201cBrat! I\u2019ll take your life any time.\u201d The one-eyed man glared coldly at Zhao Feng before leaving.\u201cAny time you wish!\u201d Zhao Feng replied and a cold azure light appeared on his left eye as he stared right back at the bandit.What\u2019s going on!?The bandit trembled and felt like his heart had been stabbed by a sword, but as he was on the verge on retreating, he didn\u2019t think about it much.\u201cWhat was that?\u201dZhao Feng felt pain pulse through his left eye and he found that he had lost a lot of mental energy.He didn\u2019t know what kind of skill he had used just then, all he felt was that his mental energy had been consumed up quickly, but he had also seen the dazed look and fear in the bandit\u2019s eye.Zhao Feng slowly closed his eyes and found that the green ray of light in his eye had extended to six foot nine, infinitely close to seven.\u201cGood!\u201d Joy appeared on his face.Because he had fought with the one-eyed leader just then, his cultivation had increased to the peak sixth rank. Now, his real cultivation was the same as Lei Cong, ranked second of the Ten Sky Guards.\u201cHahaha\u2026 You can\u2019t leave and go as you please!\u201dFrom the bushes one to two miles away, a beautiful silver haired youth appeared. The youth looked like a girl and he had a terrifying aura as he stood on top of a tree.\u201cFeng Hanyue!\u201d The youths of the Sky Guards Battalion exclaimed.He was a youth fifteen or sixteen years old. He was a Martial Master of the seventh rank.Seventh rank\u2026The one-eyed bandit looked shocked and sad at the same time. He was twenty-eight years old when he had reached the seventh rank and at that time, he was extremely proud of himself. But seeing Feng Hanyue, all his confidence and arrogance were popped like popping bubbles.His achievements were nothing compared to the youth in front of him.What kind of backgrounds did these youths have?The one eyed man sensed that something was wrong. If there were one or two geniuses that appeared, it may have been a coincidence. But if they all appeared at the same time, even retards would know something was wrong.\u201cIllusion Sky Stance!\u201dA silver glow came from Feng Hanyue\u2019s body and in an instant, he appeared in front of the bandit. The speed made the heart of the boss of bandits\u2019 shake because this skill was a true Holy martial art, although it wasn\u2019t fully learnt yet.Shattering Mountain Palm!He didn\u2019t hold any of his power back this time and he clashed head on with Feng Hanyue.Boom!The two figures \u201chmphed\u201d as they split apart.\u201cDon\u2019t think you can leave!\u201dFeng Hanyue immediately used an incomplete Holy martial art and chased after him. The two figures, one running away, one chasing disappeared into the forest.Only Lei Cong and Zhao Feng were able to keep up with the two.\u201cIf I can kill this bandit, I can get twenty battle points.\u201d Zhao Feng circulated Lightly Floating Ferry to the max and unleashed his peak sixth rank cultivation at the same time\u2026Soon, the figures merged into the vast forest leaving behind a bunch of tired youths.\u201cThat Zhao Feng doesn\u2019t seem to be weaker than Lei Cong.\u201d A few youths discussed.Lu Xiaoyu and Li Ziwen exchanged glances and saw the shock in each others\u2019 eyes. Before, they left they had laughed at Zhao Feng\u2019s team but they hadn\u2019t thought that he would be so strong.On the other side.Zhao Feng and Lei Cong tried to surround the bandit from either side while he was tangled by Feng Hanyue. Feng Hanyue had gained some insight into an incomplete Holy martial art and it was a speed one at that too, so the bandit knew he couldn\u2019t escape.\u201cDon\u2019t force me!\u201d The one-eyed leader howled and used an unknown secret skill which increased his attributes.Breaking Mountain Unlimited!The leader exploded, and unleashed the most powerful attack that he had which clashed heavily with Feng Hanyue.Deng!Feng Hanyue\u2019s body trembled and fell down onto the ground tens of metres away with blood leaking from his mouth.Die!The bandit held the blood in his mouth down and attacked Feng Hanyue.\u201cNot good!\u201d The silver figure hiding in the forest exclaimed.Shooosh!Suddenly, a faint azure arrow pierced through the bandits\u2019 shield of Inner Strength and lodged into his leg.\u201cArghhh!\u201d The one-eyed bandit screamed and almost fell down from the sky.The arrow had hit an acupuncture point on his leg and if it wasn\u2019t for his dense Inner Strength, this arrow could have paralysed his entire lower body.\u201cF*cking b*stard!\u201d The bandit flipped in the air and decided to run away.The arrow Zhao Feng just shot contained his Archery God\u2019s Left Eye skill, it not only resolved the situation Feng Hanyue was in, it also forced the one-eyed bandit leader to run away.\u201cYou be careful!\u201d Feng Hanyue glanced at Zhao Feng and Lei Cong then sat down and started to recover.Soon.There was only Zhao Feng and Lei Cong facing the bandit, but the latter\u2019s speed was just too fast. Although this was the case, Zhao Feng could clearly see that the enemy was on the verge of defeat, his left eye saw the situation inside the bandit\u2019s body. His veins and organs were damaged from the use of his secret technique.\u201cF*ck, these brats are just too persistent!\u201d The one-eyed bandit clenched his teeth.Although his speed was fast and he knew the surroundings well, he couldn\u2019t shake Zhao Feng off. On the contrary Zhao Feng was inching closer and closer.\u201cIf that\u2019s the case\u2026 \u201d A dangerous light flashed in the one-eyed man\u2019s eyes as he took a deep breath and ate a pill while sitting down.Ten breaths later, Zhao Feng appeared two hundred to three hundred metres out.Sou! Sou!Zhao Feng pulled his Golden Stairs Bow and used his Archery God\u2019s Left Eye skill. His Archery God\u2019s Left Eye skill could threaten Martial Masters of the seventh rank while he was only at the sixth.\u201cDie, brat\u2026 \u201dThe bandit forcefully suppressed his injuries as he snapped the arrows and pounced on Zhao Feng.Sou Sou Sou Sou\u2014\u2013Zhao Feng continuously pulled his bow and shot three arrows which seemed like three lightning strikes. Furthermore, the three arrows all travelled in different paths and headed towards different locations and different times.Die!The bandit snapped the first arrow, dodged the second and he was now very close to Zhao Feng now.Shu!The last arrow scraped past his shoulder, it only stopped him momentarily.A victory smile appeared on the bandit\u2019s face.As long as he got close to Zhao Feng, he had complete confidence that he could take him down in a short amount of time.One Line Star Finger!The youth in his sight pressed forward instead of retreating and suddenly, he gave off a thick powerful aura. At that moment, Zhao Feng\u2019s peak sixth rank aura was fully unleashed.Shua!The green line was like a string as it streaked across the night like a meteor. This had surpassed the limits of sixth rankers as Star Finger had reached the late stages of the fourth level.Flowing Wind Stance!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euZhao Feng merged his skill into the wind, which made the skill even faster. Just as the bandit smiled, his eye saw this and contracted.Shooo\u2026An azure light hit the one-eyed bandit\u2019s forehead.Ploom!The body of the bandit stiffened as blood appeared at the centre of his forehead. His eyes were still full of shock and terror, but the light in his eye started to dim\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

At the same time, Zhao Feng landed on the ground as well.Hu!He gently let out a breath and a faint azure light disappeared from his left eye. When he slew the one-eyed man, his left eye had been activated to it\u2019s fullest potential and the Flowing Wind Stance had merged into his finger, which made its strength comparable to Martial Masters.This was Zhao Feng\u2019s strongest attack ever!The boss of bandits would never have thought that Zhao Feng\u2019s Star Finger would reach the fourth level and that it could attack through the air. The abilities of his left eye had also caught the flaws of the enemy and under this advantage, he had stabbed the forehead of his opponent.After killing him, Zhao Feng scavenged the items. No wonder the bandit a Martial Master of the seventh rank, just the silver he had alone was two hundred to three hundred, two high ranked martial arts and one peak ranked martial art.Apart from that, Zhao Feng also found a bottle of precious \u201cRecovery Healing Pills\u201d, which did what its name suggested.Hmmm?Zhao Feng spotted a letter in the items of the bandit. Opening it, the contents inside seemed to prove that he had a trade deal going on with a noble from the Maple Fire Country.\u201cEn, the battle points I gain from this should exceed twenty, because there\u2019s evidence of him having connections with the Maple Fire Country.\u201d Zhao Feng was very pleased as he moved the corpse to the side.Sou!At this time, a bald headed silver clothed youth came from the other side.\u201cPut it down!\u201d Lei Cong ordered, trying to stop Zhao Feng\u2019s movement.\u201cWhat does Brother Lei have to say?\u201d Zhao Feng said calmly.\u201cThe bandit was severely injured before, so the battle points and items should be split amongst us.\u201d Lei Cong\u2019s face was cold and strict.Hearing this, Zhao Feng felt rage burn in his heart, this guy was trying to take battle points off him.\u201cWhen I fought the bandit, he still had seventy to eighty percent of his strength left and he was unleashing his last attacks, which made him even more dangerous.\u201d Zhao Feng said strongly as he stood in front of the dead body.He had taken a massive risk when he had fought the leader, so how could he give the battle points away?\u201cHahaha\u2026 Brat named Zhao, there\u2019s no evidence of fighting here and the one-eyed bandit was killed with one finger, do you think to you could have done that? Furthermore, there\u2019s no injuries on you, so how could you easily block the last attacks of a Martial Master?\u201d Lei Cong coldly said as lights twinkled in his eyes.Indeed, there were just too many suspicious points if Zhao Feng had really killed the leader.Firstly, the bandit had been killed with one finger without much resistance. Secondly, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t have any injuries and there were no marks of fighting.The last key point was the when Zhao Feng slew the bandit leader, there was no other youths present including Lei Cong himself.Sou! Sou! Sou\u2026Slowly, youths began to gather and when they saw the stand off between Zhao Feng and Lei Cong, they were extremely curious. After they asked the reason, why the youths began to laugh.\u201cKid! Stop trying to steal our battle points, my team, Lei Cong\u2019s team, should get at least half.\u201d Lei Cong\u2019s team were extremely aggressive.Soon, Lu Xiaoyu and Lu Chen\u2019s team also arrived.\u201cBrother Feng!\u201d Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi came to Zhao Feng\u2019s left and right side, but their force still seemed weak against Lei Cong\u2019s team.\u201cKiddo, I\u2019ll give you one more chance, give me the body of the bandit, the evidence and the spoils and we\u2019ll give you some of the battle points.\u201d Lei Cong said forcefully.\u201cNope.\u201d Zhao Feng snickered coldly, his attitude was strong as well.\u201cSeems like you\u2019ll refuse the toast of victory and drink the wine of defeat!\u201d Cold light flashed in Lei Cong\u2019s eyes as he slowly raised his hand about to attack.The youths present felt like they couldn\u2019t breathe. Lu Xiaoyu was on the side gloating, and Huang Qi had cold sweat coming off his forehead. Lei Cong\u2019s strength was second in the Ten Sky Guards and he had two of the ten in his team. Even if Zhao Feng was able to fight against Lei Cong, how were Huang Qi and Zhao Yufei supposed to face the other ten?Teng!At this moment, a beautiful figure arrived, while sending out an undefyable aura.Feng Hanyue!Many of the youths present respectfully greeted him, including Lei Cong. After the battle, Feng Hanyue\u2019s face was pale and it was obvious that his injury hadn\u2019t fully recovered yet.After knowing the situation, Feng Hanyue spoke: \u201cThe one-eyed bandit did have at least eighty percent of his strength left before he died.\u201dHua!Exclamations came from the crowd as they looked disbelievingly towards Zhao Feng.\u201cObviously, if I wasn\u2019t there, you still wouldn\u2019t have been able to kill him even if all of you went up at the same time\u2026 therefore, I get at least half of the battle points!\u201d Feng Hanyue\u2019s words suddenly twisted.At least one half!Both Zhao Feng and Lei Cong\u2019s heart clenched. Feng Hanyue did indeed put in a lot of effort into injuring the one-eyed bandit, Lei Cong and Zhao Feng both had nothing to say.\u201cThen what about the other half?\u201d Lei Cong asked.\u201cThat\u2019s not my problem, furthermore there\u2019s the Guanjun Corps scouting and calculating.\u201d Feng Hanyue spoke in an overbearing manner.Hearing this, the crowd nodded their heads, they knew that someone was calculating the battle points.Shua!At this time, a figure came from the trees not far away, his speed was two times faster than the bandit leader!Guanjun Corps!The youth\u2019s felt their heart tighten. This Guanjuun Corp had reached the eighth rank and he sent out a dominant aura, which even made Feng Hanyue look at him in awe and respect.The Guanjun Corps were the personal guards of Lord Guanjun and each of them had strength surpassing normal Martial Masters. Even Feng Hanyue never found where the Guanjun Corp were hiding.\u201cThe 20 battle points for slaying the bandit and the 10 points for gathering evidence, all for a total of 30 battle points\u2026 All goes to Zhao Feng.\u201d The Guanjun Corp announced coldly.What!?The youths that heard this, their mouths dropped wide open.How was that possible?Lei Cong, Feng Hanyue, Lu Xiaoyu were all shocked and they didn\u2019t know what to say.This Guanjun Corp was way too biased towards Zhao Feng!\u201cThe bandit leader was killed by Zhao Feng alone, and no one helped in the 100 breaths that they were fighting in. The evidence that he had connections with the enemy country was also collected by Zhao Feng alone, therefore all of the thirty points go to him.\u201d The Guanjun Corp explained.When he finished, everyone understood. The rules were like this, although Feng Hanyue and the other youths played a huge role in injuring the leader, the one that killed him was Zhao Feng alone.The Guanjun Corp glanced toward Zhao Feng and said: \u201cNot bad!\u201d before he left, leaving behind a bunch of unwilling youths who didn\u2019t dare to question him. However, some of them also looked towards Zhao Feng with wariness. The Guanjun Corp must have seen the entire scene when Zhao Feng slew the head bandit and therefore gave all the battle points to him.One had to know that 10 battle points was worth a peak ranked martial art, 50 points could be exchanged for a half-Holy Martial art.The youths looked at Zhao Feng with envy and jealously as Zhao Feng received 30 extra points. In the midst, both Feng Hanyue and Lei Cong\u2019s faces were dim.Zhao Feng felt the coldness emitting from Feng Hanyue and the warning in Lei Cong\u2019s eyes.\u201cBrother Hanyue, I heard that the person with the most battle points gets an extra reward, we can\u2019t give up so easily can we?\u201d Lei Cong said softly to Feng Hanyue.Right now, Zhao Feng obviously had the lead, shaking off Feng Hanyue and Lei Cong.\u201cI\u2019ll let him be happy for a while.\u201d Feng Hanyue\u2019s face turned calm once more.After this incident, Zhao Feng\u2019s name spread throughout the Sky Guards Battalion, some youths thought that he was just lucky, while others\u2019 eyes twinkled.The mission hadn\u2019t finished yet and according to the information taken from the bandits, the group they had just defeated were name the Desolate Destruction Bandits. In the area, there were another few groups of bandits with the Deadly Wolves Bandits being the strongest as they also had Martial Masters in the group.Three days later.The teams from the Sky Guards Battalion had killed almost all of the bandits nearby. As they engaged in battle, the strength of the youth\u2019s increased by leaps and bounds.At a certain day.A few of the smaller teams gathered together and attacked the hideout of the Deadly Wolves Bandits. The one who was in charge of information gathering was Zhao Feng.Within the depths of a cave.\u201cHow could those b*stards find our hiding place?\u201d The leader of the Deadly Wolves Bandits stood up.One had to know that the hiding point of the Deadly Wolves Bandits was insanely secure, even if one knew the area where it was located, the path was extremely dangerous and complicated and hard to follow.The bandits in the hideout were thrown into chaos as the Desolate Destruction Bandits had been massacred by those mysterious youths.\u201cKill!\u201d The groups of Sky Guards Battalion attacked.\u201cTell all our brothers to retreat!\u201d The Deadly Wolves Leader thought about the mysterious background that the youths had and he instantly made his decision.Soon, the group of twenty to thirty men escaped through the back.\u201cKill\u2026 \u201cRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFrom the back hill came the sound of battle.Sou! Sou! Sou\u2026Tens of arrows came from the forest nearby. One of the youths held a golden bow and he had instantly shot six to seven arrows, which had taken the lives of every target.\u201cHow did these f*ckers know we had this escape route?\u201d The Deadly Wolves Leader took in a cold breath.His eyes scanned the surroundings and he felt his heart turn cold when they settled on a youth holding a golden bow.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

In terms of speed alone, he surpassed the one-eyed bandit.Sou\u2013 Sou\u2014 Sou\u2014 Sou\u2014Zhao Feng remained calm and he used his Archer God\u2019s Left Eye skill. Instantly, three four arrows pierced through the air and they had a special pattern to them, one was higher while the other was lower, one was in front while the other was behind. They blocked the path of the Deadly Wolves Leader.Open!The leader was forced to activate his Inner Strength and form a shield to protect himself.Toooock!However, two arrows still broke through the barrier and one lodged itself in his foot. The Deadly Wolves Leader couldn\u2019t believe that there was such a dangerous archer in this world.\u201cLeave this person to me!\u201d A beautiful youth came from the other side, it was Feng Hanyue.\u201cEveryone retreat\u2026 \u201d The Deadly Wolves Leader didn\u2019t dare to stay, so he circulated his speed skill and headed towards the depths of the forest.Sou\u2026 Sou\u2026 Sou\u2026A few arrows came through the air again and blocked the path of the Deadly Wolves Leader forcing him to stop.\u201cStop him!\u201dLei Cong and Lu Xiaoyu came from the other side and under the combined effort of the four, they easily gained the upper hand.In the midst, Feng Hanyue was the main close combatant, while Lei Cong and Lu Xiaoyu supported him from the side. Zhao Feng was the long range controller and he used his Archer God\u2019s Left Eye skill to restrict the movement of the leader. The Deadly Wolves Leader spat out blood from anger, in his eyes, Zhao Feng was the most threatening one.Toooock!Injuries appeared on his body all due to Zhao Feng\u2019s arrow.At a certain point.Zhao Feng put the bow away and attacked the Deadly Wolves Leader.\u201cGood!\u201d The Deadly Wolves Leader laughed, he wanted to get rid of this archer first, but the opponent had skilled footwork and he would always stop him from entering the close range.Now, the youth had headed towards him for close combat.\u201cMysterious Wind Palm!\u201dA faint azure glow appeared on Zhao Feng\u2019s palm as it collided heavily with the Deadly Wolves Leaders\u2019 attack.Boom!The air wave engulfed everything in a few metres radius and using the energy, Zhao Feng retreated tens of metres back and took his bow again out.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on!?\u201dThe Deadly Wolves Leader felt that the weird palm attack dissolve his attack and chain him up for a second. And in that gap, the attacks of Feng Hanyue and co. had landed on him.Wah!The Deadly Wolves Leader instantly spat out mouthfuls of blood as he cursed Zhao Feng, but he found that Zhao Feng had retreated out of range.Sou\u2013 Sou\u2013 Sou\u2013 Sou\u2013Zhao Feng continuously fired a few arrows just as the Deadly Wolves Leader was injured.The Deadly Wolves Leader couldn\u2019t dodge at all and he could only watch the three arrows lodge themselves into his vitals.

Then, he headed towards the direction of the Sky Cloud Forest.\u201cFollow!\u201dFeng Hanyue and the others obviously didn\u2019t give up, the bandit was severely injured and this was a good chance to gain battle points.\u201cI must kill this person to exceed Zhao Feng in battle points.\u201d All three had the same idea.Up to now, Zhao Feng had the lead and the only chance to beat him was to kill the Deadly Wolves Leader.

He\u2019s a monster.\u201dLei Cong and Lu Xiaoyu looked at each other and saw the shock in each others eyes. The aura that Zhao Feng was releasing had now reached the peak sixth rank as well. Soon, the four geniuses had entered the limitless Sky Cloud Forest.The bandit area was located near the Sky Cloud Forest, so the four weren\u2019t surprised that the Deadly Wolves Leader would escape in this direction. Being born near here and having been here several times, Zhao Feng understood the landscape well.Soon, Zhao Feng was the one leading as his left eye had locked onto the figure.Half an hour later, the area ahead suddenly turned dark.Hmm?Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye saw a scene tens of miles away.\u201cHelp me, Lord.\u201d The blood soaked Deadly Wolves Leader flew onto a tree.\u201cWhat?

A skeleton could be seen in the black puddle of water.The scene made Zhao Feng, who was tens of miles away, take a cold breath.What kind of being was that hooded figure? A Martial Master of the seventh rank was demolished in one move.It was just too terrifying\u2026Not only that, the ice blue eyes seemed to glance his way as well. Zhao Feng felt his blood freeze and his breathing rate stop.Roar\u2026Three high tier deadly beasts of the eighth rank came from behind the hooded figure and they headed towards Zhao Feng and co.\u201cRun!\u201dZhao Feng sped in the opposite direction. Feng Hanyue and the others also sensed the aura of the deadly beasts and they sprinted away as well.\u201cWhy would there be high tier deadly beasts here?\u201dTwo silver figures appeared and headed towards the high tier deadly beasts.Boom\u2026The three high tiers beasts were beaten to death ten breaths later.\u201cIs this the true strength of the Guanjun Corps?\u201d Zhao Feng had seen the whole scene, couldn\u2019t help but click his tongue.\u201cWhat kind of power was it to dissolve a Martial Master into a pool of water?\u201d When the Guanjun Corps saw what happened, they all took in a cold breath but the hooded figure had disappeared.Zhao Feng and the other three let out a breath as they exited the Sky Cloud Forest.\u201cI wonder if the Deadly Wolves Leader is dead or alive.\u201d Lu Xiaoyu and Lei Cong were unwilling.At this time, one of the Guanjun Corps came flying over.\u201cThere\u2019s a change in plans, the mission ends now.\u201d The guard\u2019s voice was nervous.What happened?Why would the mission suddenly end?Feng Hanyue and the others were curious. According to what they knew, the area still had a few bandits left.\u201cDon\u2019t ask anything! Everyone return to the Guanjun Province City.\u201d The expression of the guard was solemn.Only Zhao Feng was thinking that the sudden change must have something to do with the hooded figure. The power of the hooded figure had exceeded the limits of the human body.On the same day.Under the guidance of seven to eight Guanjun Corps, the Sky Guards Battalion returned the way they came from. After leaving the bandit zone, the Guanjun Corps let out a breath. But somehow, Zhao Feng seemed to feel that a pair of ice blue eyes were following them.Inside the dimension of his left eye, the ice blue eyes appeared once again.A few days later, the geniuses arrived back in Guanjun Province City and it was only until then did the feeling of being spied on dissapear.The Guanjun Province City was under the control of Lord Guanjun, the factions must have some wariness of him.Inside the Sky Guards Battalion, Third Guard calculated the total battle points.\u201cFeng Hanyue, 45 battle points.\u201d\u201cLei Cong, 32 battle points.\u201d\u2026..\u201cLu Xiaoyu, 26 battle points.\u201dThe points awarded to the Ten Sky Guards were read out in order. Most of them were around 20 or so. Finally, it was Zhao Feng\u2019s turn.\u201cZhao Feng, 72 battle points.\u201dWhen he read that, Third Guard\u2019s eyes contracted as this was unexpected. But the battle points were given under consent of the Guanjun Corps so Third Guard wasn\u2019t suspicious.\u201c72 battle points!\u201d The youths took in a cold breath, his battle points easily dominated the others.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHmph, if I was the one who finished off the almost dead seventh rank leader, number one might\u2019ve been me.\u201dMany of them still felt that Zhao Feng was lucky.Soon, everyone\u2019s battle points had been announced and Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi both received 20 each, almost beating Lu Xiaoyu which made the latter\u2019s face turn dim.When they left, they had laughed at Zhao Feng\u2019s team. But this scene was like a slap in the face.\u201cZhao Feng, being the person with the top battle points, you get an extra reward.\u201d Third Guard kicked everyone else out except for Zhao Feng.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 76": "Chapter 76Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 76 \u2013 Two ChoicesAn extra reward?Zhao Feng\u2019s breathing rate increased: \u201cMay I ask Third Guard what the reward is?\u201d\u201cThe first choice is an extra 100 battle points and the second is all your battle points get cleared, but you get a Holy Martial Art.\u201d The man said.100 battle points\u2026 What!? Holy Martial Art?The first choice could give Zhao Feng much more items because 10 points could already be exchanged for one peak ranked martial art. But the second choice was a Holy Martial Art!No wonder the Guanjun Palace was one of the strongest factions, it could take out Holy Martial Arts easily.\u201cObviously, I suggest that you choose the first reward because you can use those points to get much more items. As for Holy Martial Arts, it\u2019s much too hard to train for those under the seventh rank, even some ninth rankers can\u2019t learn it.\u201d Third Guard suggested.Zhao Feng went into deep thought.This man in front of him was ranked third amongst the Guanjun Corps and he was one of the right hand men of Lord Guanjun, so his judgements were usually logical.If he chose the first choice, Zhao Feng could get another 100 battle points and exchange it for a half-Holy Martial art and some cultivation resources, whereas all his battle points would be cleared if he chose the second choice.He had to face a huge risk if he chose the Holy Martial Art, because it would be wasted if he couldn\u2019t train it. Thinking logically, the first choice was better but it was a Holy Martial Art! A chance to surpass the Martial Path and enter the legendary Holy Martial Path\u2026Hu!Zhao Feng took a deep breath, it was hard for him to decide.\u201cOh yeah, I forgot to tell you that one of the Guanjun Palace\u2019s rules states that those under the seventh rank can\u2019t choose a Holy Martial Art. I can give you seven more days to decide.\u201d The Guanjun Corp suddenly added.Seventh Rank of the Martial Path?Zhao Feng nodded his head, let God make the decision then.Through the mission, his cultivation had reached the peak sixth rank.Seven days.If he broke through to the seventh rank, Zhao Feng would choose the second choice. If he couldn\u2019t, then he could only choose the first.After making his decision, Zhao Feng returned to his wooden room quickly.After the mission, limitless youths went to the Treasury Hall to trade their battle points for martial arts, resources and weapons. Only Zhao Feng remained inside his wooden room.The afternoon that day, Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi returned full of joy. Zhao Yufei had chosen a peak ranked martial art and many cultivation resources.Feng Hanyue and Lei Cong both traded most of their points for cultivation resources, while Lei Cong traded all of his points for resources and pills.\u201cHahaha\u2026 this rare thousand year fire grass and blood strength pill will help me break through to the seventh rank\u2026 I will definitely succeed this time!\u201d Lei Cong sat crossed-legged in his wooden room his face full of excitement.The thousand year fire grass was much more precious than other thousand year plants as it contained more energy than the others.The blood strengthening pill helped condense and purify one\u2019s Inner Strength and it gave a certain amount of help to someone trying to break through the seventh rank.\u2026\u2026From this day on, the youths of Sky Guards Battalion all started to cultivate.Just that night alone, many youths had reached the fifth and sixth rank.The second day, the third day\u2026 Some of the youths improved dramatically. On the third day, a powerful aura washed out from Lei Cong\u2019s room, which made the youths of the Sky Guards Battalion couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201cOh my god\u2026 has Lei Cong reached the seventh rank?\u201d The expressions of the youth\u2019s changed.At the same time, there was disturbance in the other wooden rooms.The fourth day, the fifth day\u2026 Youth after youth came out of cultivation.\u201cBrother Lei is only 17 years old and at the seventh rank already, indeed a genius.\u201d\u201cHaha! I don\u2019t have to look at Feng Hanyue\u2019s face anymore, I can do whatever I want!\u201d Lei Cong walked and felt the wariness and respect in the nearby youths\u2019 eyes.At this time Lu Xiaoyu walked over: \u201cCongrations to Brother Lei for entering the Martial Master rank.\u201dLu Xiaoyu made some improvements as well, he had reached the peak sixth rank, just one step away from the seventh.Exchanging a few words, Lu Xiaoyu pulled Lei Cong over to the side and said something in a low tone.Oh?Lei Cong scanned the tenth wooden room after he heard this.Zhao Feng had stayed in his room ever since they returned from the mission and no one knew what he had received. Only Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi knew that Zhao Feng hadn\u2019t gone to the Treasury Hall to get anything.What is he doing?Even if he was going to cultivate, wouldn\u2019t it be easier if he exchanged some of his battle points for resources or pills?At this moment, Zhao Feng sat on the floor as the Inner Strength inside his body coursed throughout his body. As he was breathing, the aura he released was even stronger than usual.A few days ago, he had eaten the last one thousand year old plant and felt that his Inner Strength was purified, but Zhao Feng didn\u2019t successfully reach the seventh rank, instead he was just half a step away.\u201cIt looks like that it\u2019s unlikely that I will reach the seventh rank in the next two days.\u201d Zhao Feng sighed.The difference between the sixth and seventh rank was a massive one, so many cultivators stayed at the peak sixth rank and never managed to enter the seventh.\u201cZhao Feng! Come out and accept my challenge!\u201d Outside the room, someone shouted.Hm?Zhao Feng walked out of his room and realised there was a bunch of people gathering. The challenge came from a youth of the peak sixth rank.To receive better treatment with the Ten Sky Guards, one had to become one of the Ten Sky Guards.Fine, I\u2019ll work out my bones.Zhao Feng faced the other peak sixth rank youth.Dragon Soaring through the Sky!The opponent immediately used a peak ranked speed skill and a max level fist skill. Zhao Feng stood tall with one hand behind his back, then he pointed one finger at the youth.Ahh!The youth exclaimed, the Inner Strength contained in that one finger was unstoppable and it had almost made him cough up blood.In just two moves, he was put down by Zhao Feng.\u201cSuch strong Inner Strength!\u201d\u201cThis Zhao Feng doesn\u2019t seem like he is in the rumours.\u201dThe nearby youths were slightly stunned as Zhao Feng\u2019s strength could be placed in the top three if not the top five.\u201cWow, so strong!\u201d Lu Xiaoyu laughed lightly from not far away.Next to him stood a silver clothed bald headed youth.Hmmm?Zhao Feng was shocked as he stared at Lei Cong who had reached the seventh rank. In just a few days, another seventh rank was produced.As they looked at each other\u2019s eyes, Zhao Feng could feel the enmity and coldness in the other\u2019s eyes. That day at the bandit zone, Lei Cong wanted to take a share of Zhao Feng\u2019s battle points but he was unsuccessful.\u201cWhat brings the two of you here?\u201dZhao Feng didn\u2019t fear them, because he hadn\u2019t broken through to the seventh rank yet, he needed to spar with someone and release the frustration.\u201cBrat named Zhao, you came first in terms of battle points. I, Lei Cong, want to see how you achieved that.\u201d Light flashed in Lei Cong\u2019s eyes.\u201cWait! Let me spar with him first.\u201d Lu Xiaoyu challenged him first.\u201cYou\u2019re not my match.\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head.Although he was half a step away from reaching the Martial Master, his true strength could match the latters.\u201cWe haven\u2019t met a few days and you\u2019ve become so arrogant. I want to see how much you\u2019ve improved by.\u201d Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s eyebrows twitched as he used his best skill \u201cCloud Shattering Fist\u201d.\u201cBreak.\u201d Zhao Feng lightly exclaimed as a green streak shot out from his fingertips.\u201cInner Strength out of the body!\u201d The expression of the nearby youth\u2019s changed dramatically.Shua!Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s Cloud Shattering Fist was pierced through by the wisp of green light and a hole appeared on his chest.\u201cHow\u2026 ? You haven\u2019t reached the seventh rank yet!\u201d Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s face was pale and he couldn\u2019t believe it.Zhao Feng had defeated Lu Xiaoyu in one move. Because Zhao Feng was at the peak sixth rank and his Star Finger was at the fourth level, his attack was on par with Martial Masters.\u201cZhao Feng, your strength exceeded my expectation but you still can\u2019t beat me.\u201d Lei Cong said confidently as he slowly walked over.After reaching the seventh rank, both the quantity and quality of his Inner Strength had increased, any casual action seemed profound.\u201cShut up with the useless words, if you want a fight. then hurry it up.\u201d Zhao Feng said.\u201cGood, good, good!\u201dLei Cong laughed instead of getting angry and a silver aura suddenly appeared from his aura that swept towards the Zhao Feng.Final Wind Palm!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLei Cong\u2019s seventh rank Inner Strength exploded and as the palm pushed out, a silver air wave could be seen.One Line Star Finger!Zhao Feng\u2019s fingertip spat out an azure colored Inner Strength that streaked through the sky like a meteor and collided with Lei Cong\u2019s palm.Hong~The force created by the two washed up a thick layer of dust that engulfed the two figures.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The power from the blows made the other youths dodge them immediately.Star Finger!Zhao Feng charged forwards instead of retreating as his left eye could catch the changes of Inner Strength and blood.Boom! Boom! Boom\u2026\u2026Zhao Feng\u2019s Star Finger had reached the peak fourth level and he could fire tens of finger beams in an instant. Streaks of azure light could be seen flying everywhere, every finger strived for perfection and damage.In the short time period, Zhao Feng and Lei Cong were on par with each other. Lei Cong had the advantage in higher cultivation and therefore, he could use a wide range attacks while Zhao Feng had his Spatial Star Finger, which was on par with attacks from the seventh rank.In terms of attack speed, Zhao Feng was actually faster and he held the initiative.Final Wind breaking the Skies!Lei Cong\u2019s palm exploded and sent a barrier of wind towards Zhao Feng.\u201cMysterious Wind Palm!\u201dZhao Feng immediately merged the picture of the girl in his mind. Through the battles he had fought in, his palm was even stronger than before. The two palms clashed together, but Zhao Feng\u2019s azure palm seemed to engulf all the wind and it easily resolved Lei Cong\u2019s attack.\u201cWhat kind of skill is that\u2026 ?\u201dLei Cong was stunned, the skill he used just then was one of his best.Flowing Wind Stance!Zhao Feng\u2019s body suddenly became agile and he seemed to dance with the wind, he sometimes, he attacked with Mysterious Wind Palm and sometimes with Star Finger.Doom\u2026 Pew\u2026 Bang\u2026The two figures sent air waves crashing everywhere.Ten moves, twenty moves, thirty moves\u2026Zhao Feng\u2019s Inner Strength and skills became more honed. Facing a Martial Master had ignited the potential hin Zhao Feng. Unconsciously, his Star Finger had fully consolidated at the peak of the fourth level and his Metal Wall Technique had closed in on the late stages of the fifth level as well. This allowed him to fight a Martial Master head on and not lose.After one hundred or so moves, the two both felt slightly puffed. Zhao Feng felt his Inner Strength become purer and had a chaotic feeling to it.\u201cThis\u2026 \u201dZhao Feng felt his cultivation go a step further and he slowly started to break through the last barrier.\u201cToday\u2019s sparring stops here.\u201dZhao Feng figure immediately left the battle circle and he returned back to his wooden room. Lei Cong couldn\u2019t gain the upper hand at all and he felt slightly tired as well. He realised that this was because his cultivation hadn\u2019t stabilised.On a wooden house far away, Feng Hanyue stood there watching.\u201cBrother Feng, what do you think about the battle?\u201d One youth asked.\u201cLei Cong has just reached the seventh rank and he is pretty useless. As for Zhao Feng, he might be able to threaten me if he reaches the seventh rank.\u201d Feng Hanyue\u2019s expression was calm.At this moment, the aura coming from him seemed to be close to the peak seventh rank. It was obvious that he had improved since the mission.Inside the wooden room.Zhao Feng sat cross legged and he started to circulate his Inner Strength. Through the battle, his potential had ignited. At this moment, he even felt his Inner Strength roar powerfully as it travelled through his body. Both the quality and quantity of it was increasing rapidly. That night, Zhao Feng\u2019s Inner Strength tried to exit his body and he was finally able to condense it. Because he had the experience of making his Inner Strength leave his body due to Star Finger, he was able to successfully break through.\u201cIt worked!\u201dZhao Feng took a deep breath and he opened his palm. A green glow of light jumped out and then returned back inside his body. In this instant, he only needed one thought to completely explode his Inner Strength and send Martial Artists flying. Only then did Zhao Feng realise how strong the seventh rank was. Zhao Feng only took one day to completely control the power, even exceeding Lei Cong.If he used his Star Finger. the power would be on a whole level higher. As his cultivation increased, his Metal Wall Technique had also reached the peak fifth rank.The Metal Wall Technique was split into seven levels and the sixth level could form a barrier using Inner Strength, which even seventh and eighth ranks would find hard to break. According to what it wrote, if one reached the seventh level, their body would be perfect.Thinking about it now, Zhao Feng thought that something was wrong because at that level, it would had exceeded the limits of the human body unless there was still a gap between the sixth and seventh level. Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes twinkled as he thought about Zhao Yufei\u2019s grandfather, the one-armed old man.When they had exchanged,l the old man may have also changed something on Metal Wall Technique, just like how he had kept back information. He didn\u2019t think too much about these problems because he had broken through to the seventh rank and he could choose his reward.\u201cHoly Martial Art! It\u2019s looks like this is what God decided for me\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng suppressed his excitement.Today was the day he needed to answer Third Guard.The building in the middle of the field.\u201cYou\u2019ve decided to choose the Holy Martial Art?\u201d Third Guard was slightly surprised as he stared at Zhao Feng.He never thought that Zhao Feng would be able to reach the seventh rank and enter the ranks of Martial Masters in such a short amount of time.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s tone was decisive.\u201cOk, follow me.\u201d The Guanjun Corp didn\u2019t say much as he led Zhao Feng to the Treasury Hall.The Treasury Hall was a sacred ground of the Guanjun Palace. There were always two Martial Masters of the ninth rank yhere overseeing it place and to open the Holy Martial Arts Library, both the ninth rank Martial Masters needed to agree.\u201cOpen the Holy Martial Arts Library?\u201d The two were slightly stunned.In the Guanjun Palace, one must had the personal agreement from Lord Guanjun.\u201cOpen the Holy Martial Arts Library.\u201d Third Guard took out a dark silver and gold token.Orders of Lord Guanjun!The two Martial Masters of the ninth rank immediately bowed down. The silver and gold token represented Lord Guanjun himself. Furthermore, Third Guard was of the top three of the Guanjun Corps and he oversaw the Sky Guards Battalion, since Lord Guanjun was in secluded meditation.His status could be seen as he took out the token. The two ninth ranks led the way to a dark metallic silver building. The whole building had no windows, it just had a pure black door which had a hole in the middle of it.Third Guard walked to the door and placed the Guanjun Token into it.Weng~The pure black door slowly opened and revealed what was inside.\u201cYou can only choose one Holy Martial Art.\u201dThird Guard took Zhao Feng in then closed the door.It the dark room, there were bright jade slips, around twenty of them and they had martial art names on them.Illusion Wind Technique, Blood God Palm, Heavenly Demonic Claw, Sky Domination Hand, Silver Wall Technique\u2026\u201cEvery jade slip represents a Holy Martial Art. Once you\u2019ve decided on which one you want, you can take one out and borrow it for seven days then send it back after. What you gain all depends on your enlightenment and wisdom.\u201d The Guanjun Corp told him.Zhao Feng knew that these slips were just the summaries of the skills, the real skills had to be taken from elsewhere. There weren\u2019t many Holy Martial Arts in the room, but all of them were complete.Illusion Wind Technique: One\u2019s figure turns into the wind and creates doppelgangers. The high level can create nine doppelgangers. Minimum requirements: Seventh rank.Blood God Palm: Dissolves the enemy\u2019s flesh into water and is able to form a deadly poison.Heavenly Demonic Claw: A demonic claw that can rip metal into pieces. When trained to the peak it can destroy infinite items.\u2026\u2026Zhao Feng\u2019s heart couldn\u2019t help but shake as he saw the descriptions. Compared with these, the martial arts he learnt before were like children\u2019s play.Hmmmm?Suddenly, Zhao Feng saw a name of a jade slip named Silver Wall Technique.\u201cSilver Wall Technique?\u201dZhao Feng was overrun with joy. His Metal Wall Technique was said to be the simplified version of the Silver Wall Technique.Silver Wall Technique: A body strengthening technique that increases the trainer\u2019s strength and defense. Once trained to it\u2019s peak, the body won\u2019t even melt in fire and it exceeds the limits of the human body.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euLooking at the description, the Metal Wall Technique was similar to Silver Wall Technique but the latter was more powerful.Exceeds the limits of the human body! What kind of thought is that?According to what Zhao Feng knew, if one\u2019s body reached its peak, one could instantly step into the Holy Martial Path with just body strength alone. This was similar to the peak fifth level of the Metal Wall Technique, just their muscles alone could fight against fifth or sixth ranks.Silver Wall Technique was the same way, one could use their muscles alone and fight against cultivators of the Holy Martial Path.\u201cNo wonder it\u2019s a Holy tier body strengthening technique\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng took a deep breath and turned back to the other jade slips.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 78": "Chapter 78Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 78 \u2013 Silver Wall TechniqueZhao Feng scanned the techniques and he found that offensive skills took up the majority. There was only two body strengthening techniques including Silver Wall Technique.\u201cOffensive and speed skills must not be easy to learn.\u201d Zhao Feng thought secretly.Inside the dimension of his left eye, he had the Mysterious Wind Palm and the four incomplete Holy Martial Arts: Flowing Wind Stance, Tornado Stance, Partial Wind Stance and Burning Wind Stance.Just these Holy Martial Arts alone would take Zhao Feng a long time to learn, so he swiftly took the jade slip representing Silver Wall Technique when he thought about everything.\u201cYou choose Silver Wall Technique?\u201dThird Guard was slightly surprised. He had taken others in here before and they all took offensive skills such as Bloody God Palm and Heavenly Demonic Claw.If they learnt these skills, they would be able to beat all the other cultivators of the same rank, but there were not people who could learn them.\u201cYep.\u201dZhao Feng was decisive. He chose this skill after much thought.\u201cIt\u2019s easy to learn Holy body strengthening technique, but the difficulty increases significantly later on compared to the other skills.\u201dThe Guanjun Corp had a faint smile on his facr. He admired Zhao Feng\u2019s decision as the body was the foundation of cultivation. One would only be able to train other skills if their body would allow it.After confirming the skill, Third Guard gave a hand written book to Zhao Feng. Opening it, Zhao Feng saw the contents were similar to Metal Wall Technique but it was more indepth and profound.\u201cAlthough this is just a hand written copy, you still must return it in seven days. You must not give this technique to others or else the Guanjun Palace will cripple your cultivation.\u201d The Guanjun Corp warned.\u201cUnderstood! But I don\u2019t need to take this book back with me.\u201d Zhao Feng said calmly.As he said so, he stared at the book and flipped the pages quickly.Shua!In an instant, the contents were copied into Zhao Feng\u2019s mind. Tens of breaths later, Zhao Feng returned the hand written book back to Third Guard.\u201cYou\u2026 \u201c Third Guard was slightly dazed.\u201cI\u2019ve already memorised it.\u201d Zhao Feng gave a smile.What kind of monster was he\u2026 ?Shock and stun could be seen in Third Guard\u2019s eyes. He had seen geniuses that could memorise whatever they saw, but it was his first time seeing someone memorise the whole book.After all, the book contained complex pictures and phrases, a single difference could result in destruction. Even geniuses who could memorise what they saw in one go would look over it repetitively.\u201cAre you sure you\u2019ve memorised it all? Hehe, I bet little brother Bei will be interested\u2026 \u201c The Guanjun Corp sent Zhao Feng away with his eyes and gave a short laugh.He trusted that Zhao Feng had memorised it because no one could resist the temptation of a Holy martial art\u2026After leaving the Treasury Hall, Zhao Feng returned to the Sky Guards Battalion. As soon as he got near his wooden room, Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi looked expectantly at him.\u201cBrother Feng, what did you get at the Treasury Hall?\u201d Zhao Yufei blinked and was extremely curious.Everyone knew that Zhao Feng had gotten the most battle points in the mission so he had an extra reward.\u201cSecret.\u201dZhao Feng gave a mysterious smile and he returned to his wooden room, he didn\u2019t want everyone to know that he had a Holy Martial Art.Within the wooden room.Zhao Feng sat cross legged and the contents of Silver Wall Technique surfaced in his mind. He learnt it while comparing it with Metal Wall Technique at the same time.\u201cMetal Wall Technique is indeed just a simplified version of Silver Wall Technique\u2026 \u201dExcitement shone in Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes. The more it was so, the better it was for him because a brand new skill was hard to learn. But because he had learnt Metal Wall Technique, he had a solid foundation and therefore, it was easier to train.Silver Wall Technique was split into eleven levels.The first three levels were similar to the Metal Wall Technique with strengthening the skin as the focus. The fourth to sixth levels focused on strengthening the bones l, which increased the offensive and power of the trainer. The seventh to ninth levels focused on strengthening the organs and ignited the potential of one\u2019s body. One could form a barrier from Inner Strength that could block the arrows of ten thousand archers.The tenth level: complete change of bones and blood, break through to the Holy Martial Path!\u2026\u2026\u2026..Reading up to here, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know how to express himself. The tenth level already allowed someone to reach the Holy Martial Path.Eleventh level: Body of Perfection, almost undestroyable.Zhao Feng held his breath as he read this then compared it with the seventh level of Metal Wall Technique.\u201cIt looks like the Metal Wall Technique from the one-armed old man has problems because it misses out on at least three levels and a high ranked martial art can\u2019t allow someone to reach the Holy Martial Path.\u201d Zhao Feng analysed.He was even suspicious that the old man had the Silver Wall Technique, but he was just afraid to take it out. But since these questions had no answers, he couldn\u2019t be bothered to figure them out.On the same time, Zhao Feng started to train Silver Wall Technique. Zhao Feng only used 3 hours to easily successfully train the first three levels and he couldn\u2019t explain how nice he felt.It was the same three levels as Metal Wall Technique, but more deep.From the fourth level, the difference between the two became greater. The fourth to sixth levels of Silver Wall Technique equaled the fourth to sixth rank of the Martial Path respectively unlike the Metal Wall Technique, where the increase in levels had a massive gap.The night of the second day.Zhao Feng successfully reached the fifth level of Silver Wall Technique and his progress slowed down. But because Zhao Feng had Metal Wall Technique as the foundation, he still reached the sixth level within the next three days.\u201cThe sixth level of Silver Wall Technique, I can wipe out anyone under the seventh rank and I even challenge Martial Masters of the seventh rank with just my muscles alone.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes twinkled and a smile appeared on his lips.His strength had increased by at least one half because Inner Strength and Martial arts all used the body as the basis.After reaching the sixth level, his progress was so slow that it had technically stopped.Zhao Feng understood that the foundation of Metal Wall Technique had all been used up. To improve this technique, it now required him actually working.Hu~Zhao Feng let out a breath and yawned. He had been training for a few days and when he went out, he found out that the situation had changed in the Sky Guards Battalion.The tent that Zhao Yufei used to live in had disappeared, leaving behind Huang Qi\u2019s.\u201cTwo days ago, Lady Yufei had reached top five of the Ten Sky Guards and Lu Xiaoyu had reached top three. Apart from that, two more of the original Ten Sky Guards have been replaced\u2026 \u201d Huang Qi summarised the situation.The kill mission had changed the situation of the Ten Sky Guards as some youths had received good rewards, which allowed them to increase by leaps and bounds.However, no one challenged Zhao Feng because he had fought Lei Cong to a draw a few days ago and was said to be ranked 3rd.\u201cOh yeah, you need to be careful. Lei Cong is coming out of training today and I heard that he wants to spar with you again.\u201d Huang Qi warned.Lei Cong?Zhao Feng smiled and didn\u2019t put it to heart. His cultivation had been suppressed to the peak sixth rank, so Huang Qi didn\u2019t know that he had broken through. His Withering Wood Technique had reached the max level, which could allow him to even fake death.Soon, Zhao Feng arrived at the fifth wooden room and sparred with Zhao Yufei. Zhao Yufei did make some major improvements, training in three different peak ranked martial arts, which were offensive, defensive and body strengthening respectively.Zhao Yufei learnt skills and increased in cultivation way faster than others. After the mission, she had honed her skills and her potential had ignited, which allowed her to reach the peak sixth rank.As the two sparred, two youths of fifteen to sixteen year old arrived at the entrance of the Sky Guards Battalion.\u201cThere newbies arriving at the Sky Guards Battalion?\u201d A few of the youths were curious.The two were different, one was handsome and easy to interact with, while the other was expressionless.\u201cMaster will be coming out in half a month, I wonder how many of the Sky Guards Battalion he will choose.\u201d The social youth said.The expressionless youth only listened and didn\u2019t reply. The two walked shoulder to shoulder and arrived in front of the Ten Sky Guards.\u201cSixth brother, don\u2019t you want to see the elites of the Ten Sky Guards?\u201d The interactive youth asked.\u201cNo.\u201d The expressionless youth said.\u201cAhh, you\u2019re too straightforward.\u201d A light smile appeared on his face as he sighed.\u201cWho dares to be arrogant here!?\u201d Lei Cong just happened to walk out from the second room and heard this.\u201cZhe zhe seventh rank, so-so.\u201d The talkative youth said playfully.\u201cI\u2019ll see what makes you so arrogant.\u201dLei Cong send a palm with a ring of Inner Strength in it towards the two youths. If they were Martial Artists, this move alone would send them flying.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euHowever, the two didn\u2019t move at all.\u201cF*ck off!\u201dThe expressionless youth stood still as he released a bronze coloured Inner Strength that ripped Lei Cong\u2019s attack into shreds.Boom\u2014-Lei Cong\u2019s body was sent flying and with a \u201ckrak\u201d, the wooden room behind him was also destroyed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

They sent Lei Cong flying in one hit.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t they know that it\u2019s against the rules to destroy the wooden houses?\u201dA few of the youths were shocked. Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei were both alarmed by this as well. When they went out, they saw that the wooden house belonging to Lei Cong had been destroyed and Lei Cong himself had just managed to get rid of the wood covering him.\u201cAren\u2019t you two scared of the punishment from the Sky Guards Battalion?\u201d Lei Cong wiped the blood leaking from his mouth.\u201cWe\u2019re not from the Sky Guards Battalion.\u201d The handsome youth curled his lips while the expressionless youth remained expressionless.\u201cFinal Wind destroying the Skies!\u201dLei Cong once again exploded his Inner Strength and shot towards the two strangers. This move contained his full power and it could easily kill cultivators of the sixth rank.\u201cLet me do it!\u201dThe joyful youth laughed gently and he sent a twirl of white Inner Strength towards the attack and resolved it easily.\u201cAh!\u201dLei Cong felt his body move forward without doing anything, so he immediately circulated his Inner Strength and tried to retreat.\u201cHehe, come down!\u201dThe youth twirled his hand once more and Lei Cong felt a suction force below him that pulled him down.Plop!Lei Cong fell right down and he was kicked flying by the youth.\u201cAye, it looks like there aren\u2019t any geniuses within the Sky Guards Battalion.\u201d The handsome youth shook his head.\u201cI said that.\u201d The expressionless youth said that, but what he actually meant what \u201cI said that, it was you that forced me to come here\u2026.\u201dThe other youth stiffened slightly.The fight had started and ended in an instant.Si!The watching youths of the Sky Guards Battalion drew in cold breaths. Lei Cong ranked number two had been defeated this easily.\u201cThat skill he just used had surpassed the peak ranked martial arts, could it be\u2026 \u201cZhao Feng was slightly stunned. He was certain that the skill the joyful youth had just used was at least at the half-Holy rank!\u201cWho says that the Sky Guards Battalion is weak?\u201d A cold clear sound came from a wooden room on the side.Shua!A beautiful silver haired figure appeared.\u201cFeng Hanyue!\u201dExpressions of joy appeared on the youths of the Sky Guards Battalion. Feng Hanyue was ranked first amongst the Ten Sky Guards and he had reached the seventh rank way before Lei Cong. And he had beaten Lei Cong when he had reached the seventh rank in ten moves.\u201cHm? There seems to be some sort of genius at least.\u201d The talkative youth laughed as he sized up Feng Hanyue.Feng Hanyue started to glow silver as his hair flowed in the wind.Ceng! Shua!The two youths immediately crossed paths and with a bang, they created a hole where they stood.\u201cSky Illusion Stance!\u201dFeng Hanyue used his incomplete Holy Martial Art and his figure became like the moon, unrealistic and fast.\u201cWind Turbine Technique!\u201dThe other youth stood still and clasped his hands together. As he did so, a tornado appeared.What!Feng Hanyue felt his body being forcefully pulled by a force.\u201cWhat kind of technique is this? My incomplete Holy martial art has no effect at all.\u201dBoom!The social youth made two slicing actions with his hands and the tornado turned into circles and circles that tried to restrain Feng Hanyue.\u201cIllusion Moon Heavenly Slice!\u201dFeng Hanyue shouted and a cold silver glow appeared on his arms that turned into blades and collided with the enemy\u2019s attacks.The two forces bit at each other for a moment before the remaining energy blew everything away.At last, the social youth had destroyed Feng Hanyue\u2019s half-Holy martial art because he had more profound Inner Strength.Pew!Feng Hanyue\u2019s body was sent seven to eight metres away and he was extremely pale faced: \u201cEven half-Holy martial arts don\u2019t affect him, could it be that he\u2019s trained a Holy martial art\u2026 ?\u201d\u201cNot bad, you managed to sustain twenty moves with me.\u201dThe youth that won had admiration in his eyes. At this moment, his aura was fully released and he made Lei Cong and Feng Hayue hard to breath.\u201cEighth rank of the Martial Path\u2026 \u201d Lei Cong exclaimed.The social youth\u2019s cultivation had surpassed everyone in the Sky Guards Battalion.\u201cEighth rank of the martial path\u2026 And a peak eighth rank!\u201d Zhao Feng was shocked by what he saw.The other expressionless youth had reached the peak eighth rank.It was hard to imagine that a fifteen to sixteen year old youth that had almost reached the ninth rank. The ninth rank was already the peak because the Holy martial path was just a legend.\u201cWho are you!?\u201d Feng Hanyue looked at the two warily.\u201cI\u2019m Nan Gongfan and this is my sixth brother\u2026 Bei Moi.\u201d The talkative youth introduced.Nan Gonfgan? Bei Moi?The youths haven\u2019t even heard of them, but how could they not know such geniuses in the Guanjun Palace?\u201cBrother Nan Gongfan and Brother Bei, what brings you here?\u201dFrom the building sounded a voice.Before the people could react, Third Guard appeared.\u201cElder Brother.\u201d Nan Gongfan and Bei Moi both bowed.Elder Brother? Third Guard was the elder brother of the two? Lei Cong and co. almost swallowed their tongues.\u201cThese two are disciples of Lord Guanjun.\u201d Third Guard told the Sky Guards Battalion.\u201cDisciples of Lord Guanjun?\u201d Waves of admiration, jealousy and envy shook in their hearts.\u201cNo wonder they\u2019re so strong, they\u2019re disciples of Lord Guanjun!\u201d Many of the geniuses let out sighs of relief.\u201cI heard that Master will be coming in half a month to find disciples in the Sky Guards Battalion, so we came to check them out.\u201d Nan Gongfan said smiling while Bei Moi next to him was expressionless as always.\u201cBrother Bei, we have one person that may beat you in a certain aspect.\u201d Third Guard have a mysterious smile.Hearing this, interest immediately showed on both Nan Gongfan and Bei Moi\u2019s faces.\u201cWho?\u201dBei Moi turned around and scanned the faces of the geniuses on the field. In their eyes, only Feng Hanyue was so-so.\u201cZhao Feng.\u201d Third Guard\u2019s eyes turned to Zhao Feng not far away.\u201cWhat does Third Guard want with me?\u201d Zhao Feng walked forward with a weird expression.Him?Nan Gongfan and Bei Moi both stared at him, which made Zhao Feng feel a lot of pressure.\u201cBrother Bei, although your talent is good and you have a good memory, Zhao Feng may be better.\u201d Third Guard said.\u201cHehe, really?\u201d Nan Gongfan asked excitedly.These two seemed as if they wanted someone to beat this brother of theirs. Yes, Bei Moi\u2019s talent was just insane, it had reached a level where the both of them were jealous and envious.In terms of gaining enlightenment and talent, Bei Moi had surpassed them way too much. Now that they had finally found someone who might be able to exceed Bei Moi in terms of memory, they obviously wouldn\u2019t pass this chance up.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it.\u201d Bei Moi casually said these three words.\u201cHow do you know if you don\u2019t try?\u201d Nan Gongfan seemed excited, although he wasn\u2019t that confident.Soon, they entered the building at the middle of the field.Third Guard immediately took a book out and slammed it onto the table: \u201cThis is a half-Holy martial art name Smoking Transparent Step.Half Holy martial art?Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes lit up.\u201cBoth of you haven\u2019t learnt this skill right\u201d His eyes scanned both Zhao Feng and Bei Moi.\u201cNope!\u201d The two both shook their heads.\u201cBoth of you use your fastest speed to memorise the contents.\u201d Third Guard announced.\u201cI\u2019ll go first.\u201dBei Moi took over the book and flipped over the pages. In the entire time, he seemed like a stone statue.Around half the time it took to boil tea later, Bei Moi finished: \u201cYou can test me on anything.\u201d\u201cLet me test you.\u201dNan Gongfan snatched the book and hr picked some places at random in which Bei Moi responded immediately and correctly.This performance shocked Zhao Feng. Ever since he had merged with the mysterious eye, this was the first genius he had seen that could memorise anything just by looking at it once.\u201cZhao Feng, it\u2019s your turn.\u201d Third Guard said.Zhao Feng nodded his head and took the Smoking Transparent Step book.Shua! Shua! Shua\u2026Around ten breaths later, Zhao Feng returned back the book: \u201cDone.\u201dThis fast?Bei Moi and Nan Gonfang were surprised and suspicious. The two chose complex points in the book, but Zhao Feng had memorised it perfectly.\u201cToo strong, his memory has surpassed Brother Bei Moi\u2019s.\u201dNan Gongfan was excited and it seemed as if it was an accomplishment for someone to beat Bei Moi.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201dBei Moi\u2019s eyes scanned Third Guard and Zhao Feng, thinking that the two might have teamed up to trick him.\u201cHow do you want to prove it then?\u201d Third Guard asked back.Pah!Bei Moi took out a book and said casually: \u201cHalf Holy martial art \u2013 Returning Breath Technique!\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Just in this short while, without using a bit of energy, he had earned a half-holy ranked speed skill and now, he was getting a Inner Strength one. The two skills were all useful ti Zhao Feng because his Lightly Micro Step was just a high ranked martial art. Even if he did have the help of Air Crossing Breathing Technique, it was only comparable to a peak ranked martial art.As for the Inner Strength skill, Zhao Feng\u2019s Lightly Floating Ferry, with the help of Air Crossing Breathing Technique, was comparable to a half-holy ranked martial art and the one that Bei Moi took out was already at the half-holy rank.\u201cThis is a skill I took from a cultivator of the ninth rank after I slew him. Even I haven\u2019t read it yet, if you can still memorise it in the short amount of time like before, then you win.\u201d Bei Moi said.Slew a cultivator of the ninth rank?Zhao Feng was shocked as he stared at the expressionless youth in front of him.How strong was he?The weird thing was that Third Guard and Nan Gongfan weren\u2019t suspicious of him at all. But slightly and just faintly, Zhao Feng saw the jealousy in Nan Gongfan\u2019s eyes. It was obvious that although they had the same Master, Third Guard and Nan Gongfan were both envious of Bei Moi\u2019s talent.Now that they had finally found someone who could beat Bei Moi in a certain aspect, they were obviously happy.\u201cWhat? Are you scared?\u201dA light smile appeared on Bei Moi\u2019s lips, he couldn\u2019t believe that anyone in the Guanjun Palace could beat him in terms of memorising. He was certain that Zhao Feng had planned this with Third Guard to trick him.\u201cSure.\u201d Zhao Feng laughed within his heart.Maybe a half holy ranked martial art wasn\u2019t precious to Third Guard and Bei Moi as they were disciples of Lord Guanjun, but it was to Zhao Feng.After he accepted, Zhao Feng immediately read the contents of Returning Breath Technique.Shua! Shua! Shua\u2026..As Zhao Feng swiped through the pages, a faint green light appeared on his left eye. But no paid attention to it as the aura it released was the exact same as Zhao Feng\u2019s body.Tens of breaths later.Pah!Zhao Feng threw the book back onto the table and let out a breath: \u201cTest me.\u201d\u201cLet me do it.\u201dSurprise and suspiciousness rose in Bei Moi\u2019s eyes, so he took the book and picked a few places.Zhao Feng immediately responded without hesitation and answered all the questions perfectly.\u201cHehe, Brother Bei! You lost!\u201d Nan Gongfan couldn\u2019t explain the joy in his heart.\u201cIt looks like Brother Bei loses at times as well.\u201dAn expression of satisfaction appeared on Third Guard\u2019s face as Zhao Feng was in the Sky Guards Battalion after all, which was under his control.But the one who was the most happy was actually Zhao Feng. Without using any energy at all, he had gotten two half holy ranked martial arts. Where else could he find stuff like this?Only Bei Moi had a grim face on.After all, he was only a youth of fifteen to sixteen years old and he had never received criticism before. Zhao Feng even saw the cold light in his eyes, it was obvious that Zhao Feng left a mark in Bei Moi\u2019s heart.\u201cIs it worth it to offend a super genius for two half holy ranked martial arts?\u201d Zhao Feng thought deeply.To lose is to gain, everything had a price.\u201cMemory doesn\u2019t mean you can gain insights. I\u2019m leaving.\u201d Bei Moi stood up and left by himself.Nan Gongfan and Third Guard exchanged glances, they were happy to see Bei Moi lose. Zhao Feng then got up and returned back to his wooden room.Closing his eyes, Returning Breath Technique and Smoking Transparent Step surfaced in his mind. A smile appeared on his face as he looked at the two skills. This was his first time touching a half-holy ranked martial art.He first looked at Returning Breath Technique, which was an Inner Strength skill. The more profound an Inner Strength skill was, the more complex it was to learn and train and it was dangerous as the slightest mistake could result in disaster. But for Zhao Feng, it was far easier because of his left eye. At this moment, he opened the ability of his left eye and a weird hot feeling spread throughout his body.Zhao Feng could see the blood flow and Inner Strength in his body. This power was similar to the legendary \u201cInner Sight\u201d, which could only be achieved at the peak ninth rank, but his sight was even clearer.In just a few hours, Zhao Feng had entered the beginning stages of Returning Breath Technique. Even Bei Moi would be shocked if he saw this.Returning Breath Technique: Condenses the Inner Strength of the highest quality to form a stronger one. This skill allows one to store more Inner Strength than normal.\u201cThis Inner Strength skill is so strong!\u201d Zhao Feng felt his voice tremble slightly.Returning Breath\u2019s advantage was that under the condensation of Inner Strength, another Inner Strength of higher quality and lower quantity was formed, therefore one could store more.Half a day later.Zhao Feng had condensed a small bubble of Returning Air Inner Strength and the power of it easily exceed his Air Crossing Breathing Technique.The most shocking part was that the Returning Breath Inner Strength could dissolve the Inner Strength of others. Zhao Feng\u2019s original Inner Strength from Air Crossing Breathing Technique was slowly being devoured and changed. As time passed, the Returning Breath Inner Strength became stronger as well.One day and night later.All of Zhao Feng\u2019s original Inner Strength had been changed to Returning Breath Inner Strength. The new Inner Strength formed a layer of green so fast that Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but sigh.\u201cMy Returning Breath Inner Strength absorbs other Inner Strength and converts it to my own\u2026 therefore, the attributes of it are the same as before\u2026 \u201dZhao Feng found this point and he was extremely excited. This way, his Returning Breath Inner Strength could be used with his Lightly Floating Ferry and although the effect may only be eighty to ninety percent of before, it had greater quantity and quality.After Returning Breath Technique had been started, Zhao Feng found that his Inner Strength was stronger than Lei Cong\u2019s by at least one half; and this was him only just starting to learn it.Next, he started to learn his Smoking Transparent Step outside. This half-holy ranked martial art was extremely similar to his Lightly Micro Step.Smoking Transparent Step: As light as smoke. When trained to the low level, one could move around without being heard.Because his Lightly Micro Step had reached the max level, it was easy to enter the beginning stages of Smoking Transparent Step. But if Zhao Feng wanted to reach the low level, it would be hard.Zhao Feng trained hardcore for several days, but he still couldn\u2019t reach the low level. At the point of difficulty, he saw the Flowing Wind Stance in his eye.Flowing Wind Stance was a support Holy martial art and when he used Smoking Transparent Step with it, he seemed to gain new insights.Half a minute later.Zhao Feng opened his eyes. He trained Smoking Transparent Step once again and he found that he had reached the low level. After reaching the low level, it increased by leaps and bounds and slowed down as it got closer to the high level. At this time, Zhao Feng had gained insights into Flowing Wind Stance as well.\u201cHmmm, it\u2019s about time.\u201d Zhao Feng stopped training his skills.Up to now, he had a few major skills:Holy ranked martial art \u2013 Silver Wall TechniqueHalf Holy ranked martial arts: Returning Breath Technique, Smoking Transparent Step, Lightly Floating FerryPeak ranked martial art: Star Finger (Power not any weaker than half-holy ranked martial arts.)Apart from these, he also had Archer God\u2019s Left Eye, whose rank was unknown. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know even know how strong he was now.\u201cIf we return back to Sun Feather City now, there\u2019ll be no one my match.\u201d Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but sigh.Obviously he didn\u2019t want to return back to Sun Feather City now. In this Province City, there were many geniuses of the same generation that were on par with him, if not stronger.That Bei Moi was already at the peak eighth rank and he could already kill cultivators of the ninth rank. Staying here, Zhao Feng felt competition and pressure which ignited his potential.Learning the few skills, Zhao Feng exited his room and he found that there was more changes in the Ten Sky Guards.\u201cI heard that Lord Guanjun\u2019s coming out in a few days time, so everyone is trying to become one of the Ten Sky Guards.\u201dSpeaking up to here, Huang Qi was slightly depressed. There was just too many geniuses in the Sky Guards Battalion and under the competition, the youths\u2019 cultivation increased by leaps and bounds.Huang Qi was the top genius within Pearl Tree City, but he couldn\u2019t even make it into the Ten Sky Guards after coming here.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cI barely managed to reach ninth wooden room two days ago, but I was immediately challenged and lost.\u201d Huang Qi said bitterly.The rankings of the Ten Sky Guards moved significantly these few days, apart from three people. These three were Feng Hanyue, Lei Cong and Zhao Feng.Although Zhao Feng was tenth, his true strength was at least top three, so no one dared to challenge him, which meant that number nine was the major target.On this day.Third Guard assembled the youths and announced: \u201cLord Guanjun has come out of secluded meditation and he will be arriving here personally in three days time.\u201dPrevious Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 81": "Chapter 81Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 81 \u2013 Intense Competition\u201cLord Guanjun has come out secluded meditation and he will be arriving here personally in three days time.\u201d The news exploded in the Sky Guards Battalion.Many youths clenched their fists with excitement. In the Guanjun Province City, Lord Guanjun mean absolute power, he was a legendary figure respected by every cultivators.As this news was announced, the competition between the Ten Sky Guards became even more intensive with some of the top ten challenging each other.Without a doubt, the higher your rank was in the Ten Sky Guards, the higher your chance was of getting picked. The group of youths seemed to go insane, crazily cultivating and challenging each other. even if they knew they had almost no chance of winning.Over these two days, even Zhao Feng received some challenges.Zhao Feng accepted them all and used Star Finger to finish the opponent off in one move. To attract less problems, Zhao Feng released his seventh rank aura.He did this because of two reasons.Firstly, less people would challenge him. If his cultivation reached the seventh rank, he would have entered the stages of a Martial Master and a whole new level. Even if you gave the other youths a hundred guts, they wouldn\u2019t dare to challenge him.Secondly, the higher the cultivation that Zhao Feng showed, the higher chance of getting picked by Lord Guanjun. Zhao Feng also admired the mysterious and legendary Lord Guanjun.\u201cOh my god! Zhao Feng had reached the seventh rank!\u201d\u201cThe Sky Guards Battalion now has another super genius!\u201dThe news of Zhao Feng reaching the seventh rank exploded. Zhao Yufei and Huang Qi both came to congratulate him.\u201cCongratulations to Brother Zhao for reaching the Martial Master.\u201d Huang Qi looked respectfully and admiringly at Zhao Feng.The three tiers in the nine ranks of the Martial Path were called: Martial Learner, Martial Artists and Martial Master.Once someone reached a higher tier, their status would change significantly.Martial Learners were the bottom tier of cultivators. Martial Artists not only had some strength, people would respect them. One would enter the top tier only by entering the Martial Master rank.Once someone reached the seventh rank, they would receive invitations from any of the thirteen countries.\u201cI knew Brother Feng wouldn\u2019t lose to Feng Hanyue and Lei Cong.\u201d Happiness shone in Zhao Yufei\u2019s eyes.She felt it easy to accept Zhao Feng reaching the seventh rank and she was happy for him.From an outer disciple to an inner disciple, then to a genius inSun Feather City, Zhao Yufei had been there and witnessed his rise.\u201cYufei, with your potential, you\u2019ll reach the seventh rank soon.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled and scanned his left eye over Zhao Yufei\u2019s body.Zhao Yufei\u2019s cultivation had reached the peak sixth rank and she was ranked fifth within the Ten Sky Guards.In the building in the middle of the area.\u201cThere\u2019s been quite a few geniuses in the Sky Guards Battalion, I hope it doesn\u2019t disappoint Lord Guanjun\u2026 \u201d Third Guard murmured.Although he stayed in the building most of the time, he still knew the situation in the Sky Guards Battalion. After hearing that Zhao Feng had reached the seventh rank, Feng Hanyue and Lei Cong were shocked.Time crept towards the end of the three days and the atmosphere became more and more tense.The ninth position was changing almost every hour. Those that didn\u2019t get challenged were the three great geniuses of the seventh rank, who all used unsurpassable strength to beat their opponents.Zhao Feng calmed down and focused on increasing his strength for the last two days. The time Zhao Feng that had was limited, so he focused on Returning Breath Technique and Star Finger, which broke through to the fifth level on the third day.Star Finger was split into seven levels and the fifth level made Zhao Feng\u2019s finger send out pulses of beautiful light.Extreme perfection! Extreme speed!This was Zhao Feng\u2019s feeling as he used Star Finger. In just one breaths time, he could fire seven to eight fingers and make the attacks threaten seventh ranks.The ultimate move \u201cOne Line Star Finger\u201d reached the power of the eighth rank and this was when he wasn\u2019t even using Silver Wall Technique.\u201cUnderstood, Lord Guanjun will arrive tomorrow.\u201dThe night of the third day, the competition was red hot.At night.Huang Qi finally reached rank ninth in the Ten Sky Guards and he settled down there. Now, he had two peak ranked martial arts that had reached a high level and he had also reached the peak sixth rank as well.\u201cI\u2019m finally back.\u201dHuang Qi let out a breath and he challenged number eight who he beat. He did this because the ninth position was just too dangerous as there were too many people challenging it.Even if Huang Qi\u2019s peak sixth rank cultivation, he was only placed eighth, which proved how intense the competition was.\u201cZhao Feng, with your strength you can reach top three.\u201d Huang Qi was curious.He knew Zhao Feng\u2019s strength, Zhao Feng could kill quasi-martial masters when he was only at the peak sixth rank and the latter had received many battle points after the mission. Huang Qi was certain that Zhao Feng could become first or second. He put second in because Feng Hanyue had reached the peak seventh rank.Within the Ten Sky Guards, Feng Hanyue was first, Zhao Feng second and Lei Cong third.Obviously, this was the rankings that the other youths had given them, but Zhao Feng was still tenth in the Ten Sky Guards.\u201cI\u2019ve already reached the seventh rank, so it doesn\u2019t really matter.\u201d Zhao Feng gave a casual smile.Huang Qi couldn\u2019t help but give an envious look. With Zhao Feng\u2019s current cultivation, there was a high chance of him being chosen by Lord Guanjun and so his rank didn\u2019t really matter.He was a super genius who reached the seventh rank before sixteen years old.Time passed slowly.Finally morning arrived and Third Guard walked out of his building: \u201cTime is up! All of the Ten Sky Guards come meet me here tomorrow morning. At that time, Lord Guanjun will come personally to give you pointers.\u201dHearing this, the Ten Sky Guards screamed with excitement, while the ones who weren\u2019t chosen felt sad.\u201cHahaha\u2026 I can finally sleep now!\u201d Huang Qi laughed out loud.It was obvious that Third Guard wanted the youths to be in their peak state when meeting Lord Guanjun. Zhao Feng was also excited. Ever since he had merged with the eye, he had increased by leaps and bounds.When he had entered the Guanjun Palace, the competition between the geniuses had ignited his potential and now, he had the chance to meet the legendary figure of the Cloud Country.That night, the Ten Sky Guards slept sweetly.The next morning.All the youths got up early, full of power.Without the calling of Third Guard, the Ten Sky Guards walked into the building in the middle of the fields.Inside the building.The ten youths arrived half an hour early.\u201cNot bad, you\u2019re all early.\u201dThird Guard counted the people present and confirmed their names as there was just too many changes in the ranks in the last few days.\u201cMm-hmm. Ten people here, Feng Hanyue, Lei Cong, Lu Xiaoyu, Zhao Yufei\u2026 Huang Qi, Li Ziwen, Zhao Feng.\u201dRead Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhen he read Zhao Feng\u2019s name, he was slightly stunned and the other youths had weird expressions when they heard this, but no one questioned his strength.Tah! Tah! Tah\u2026Just at this time, footsteps sounded from outside.The ten youths held their breaths. Before the door even opened, a terrifying power had already pressured upon them. The footsteps seemed to stand upon their hearts.Under the gazes of everyone, a few figures walked in\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Tah!The footsteps made the heart of the youths clench. Only Third Guard stood there expressionlessly.Creeeek!The door was opened and three figures entered.The person leading was a fairly handsome youth with clear eyes and a sharp aura.\u201cIt\u2019s him\u2026 \u201dZhao Feng found that he knew the person.Yi!Surprise flashed in Zhao Yufei\u2019s eyes. This person was the person that brought them from Sun Feather City, Ye Linyun. Behind Ye Linyun were two youths, one smiling and the other expressionless.Nan Gongfan! Bei Moi!Feng Hanyue and Lei Cong felt their heart jump.Why did they come?Zhao Feng felt was shocked, he had interacted with Nan Gongfan and Bei Moi, so he knew how terrifying they were. Especially Bei Moi who had reached the peak eighth rank and could slay cultivators of the ninth.The Ten Sky Guards were dim compared to these two.\u201cBrother Ye is here too.\u201d Third Guard greeted Ye Linyun.Zhao Feng found that Ye Linyun\u2019s seat was even in front of Third Guard.\u201cMaster Ye is also a disciple of Lord Guanjun?\u201d Zhao Feng was stunned.Just at this moment, he saw Ye Linyun looking at him, it was obvious that Ye Linyun had high hope for Zhao Feng.\u201cLord Guanjun has come out of secluded meditation this time to confirm one to two core disciples. We don\u2019t have any chances.\u201d Ye Linyun and Third Guard discussed.Core disciples?Expressions of questioning showed on the youth\u2019s faces.\u201cThere nothing strange, Master Ye, Nan Gongfan and I are all outer disciples. Only Bei Moi is a core disciple.\u201d Third Guard explained.Outer disciple!Waves of shock surged in the Ten Sky Guards\u2019 heart.Ye Linyun and Third Guard were both at the ninth rank and they were only Outer disciples!? Nan Gongfan was already at the eighth rank at such a young age and he was only an Outer disciple?Only Bei Moi was Lord Guanjun\u2019s core disciple.\u201cThat Bei Moi is only older than me by one year and he\u2019s already at the peak eighth rank and he can kill cultivators of the ninth. Only super geniuses like him can become Lord Guanjun\u2019s core disciple\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng took in a cold breath.With Bei Moi\u2019s strength, he could easily defeat everyone in Sun Feather City and he was a peak tier fighter in Guanjun Province City too. But a genius like him was a competitor.When the youths looked at Bei Moi, their eyes dimmed. If it was ten years ago, Nan Gongfan and Feng Hanyue\u2019s talents were the top in a generation, yet because Bei Moi existed, the other geniuses would pale in comparison.At one time, everyone looked at Bei Moi with envy, jealousy and helplessness.\u201cSir Third Guard, Master has orders to take these Ten Sky Guards to the Spiritual Martial Hall.\u201dThe person that came was a Guanjun Corp that half-knelt on the ground. There were eighteen people in the Guanjun Corps, but the top three were all powerful cultivators.\u201cSpiritual Martial Hall?\u201d Ye Linyun and Third Guard glanced at each other and they saw the curiosity in each other\u2019s eyes.Spiritual Martial Hall was an important area in Guanjun Palace and it was the place where Lord Guanjun cultivated. Usually, no one would be allowed to enter the Spiritual Martial Hall unless they were called for.\u201cIt looks like Master has decided to take some disciples in. This is a big chance for all of you.\u201d Ye Linyun said solemnly then stood up and led the way.The Ten Sky Guards felt a different atmosphere, but they knew this was a chance to change their destiny.\u201cThree years ago, Brother Bei Moi and I went into Spiritual Martial Hall together, but I ended up as an outer disciple while he became a core disciple\u2026 \u201d Nan Gongfan took a deep breath and glanced towards Bei Moi next to him.Bei Moi stood there expressionlessly. Going back, Nan Gongfan still didn\u2019t remember how it was decided, but from that day onwards, their destiny changed. Once they became Lord Guanjun\u2019s disciples, even if they were an outer disciple, they would receive many precious resources to help them cultivate.Soon.Everyone arrived in front of an ancient silver grey hall. This hall looked like it was empty and dead.Entering the hall, not a single figure could be seen, but Zhao Feng could sense the three-four Guanjun Corps there if he opened his eye.\u201cMaster, they\u2019re here.\u201d Ye Linyun stood at the door full of respect.\u201cEnter.\u201d A sound came from the depths of the hall. The voice seemed to pass through the clouds, with no intention to shock them but it still did so.The Ten Sky Guards held their breaths and every step they took seemed to go towards heaven.Zhao Feng felt excited and a warm feeling spread throughout his eye into his body. At this moment, he didn\u2019t dare open his left eye because he had the feeling that a being in the hall was monitoring their every move.Tah Tah! Tah Tah!The group of youngsters walked uneasily into the hall. Even Bei Moi and Nan Gongfan had solemn faces on. In the centre of the great hall, a person sat on a futon. If one didn\u2019t see it with their eyes, they wouldn\u2019t have sensed that someone was there.The figure that sat on the futon was a middle aged man wearing gold and silver robes that released no aura at all. It was like he was a commoner. It was hard to believe such a person was the legendary Lord Guanjun.\u201cMaster, the Ten Sky Guards are here.\u201d Third Guard said as he bowed down.\u201cGood!\u201d Lord Guanjun nodded his head as he opened his eyes and waved his hand.The second he opened his eyes the youths were attracted by the limitless ocean within them. Zhao Feng had the feeling that Lord Guanjun\u2019s casual move seemed to interact with his surroundings. The casual swipe of his hands was like a king signalling them to sit.Ye Linyun, Third Guard, Bei Moi and Nan Gongfan sat near Lord Guanjun, whereas the other ten youths sat on futons in accordance with their rank.First was Feng Hanyue, Second was Lei Cong, Third Lu Xiaoyu\u2026 Tenth Zhao Feng.\u201cMaster, there\u2019s quite a few talented geniuses in the Sky Guards Battalion.\u201d Third Guard murmured.Lord Guanjun was expressionless as he casually glanced at the Ten Sky Guards.Ah!The ten youths instantly felt like they had been struck by lightning.In the blink of an eye.Lord Guanjun saw the cultivation of every youth.Zhao Feng had a feeling that even though his Withering Wood Technique had reached the max level, he still couldn\u2019t hide his cultivation from Lord Guanjun.\u201cStronger than the previous lot, but none of you have the chance to become my core disciple.\u201d Lord Guanjun said expressionlessly as if he was just saying a normal thing, but Zhao Feng saw the disappointment in his eyes.Huang!The ten youths felt like they had fallen into hell. Lord Guanjun said that none of these geniuses entered his eye.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHow could it be like this!?\u201d Ye Linyun and Third Guard were both shocked and full of disbelief.In their eyes, even though they weren\u2019t monsters like Bei Moi, there were geniuses such as Feng Hanyue and Zhao Feng who had both reached the seventh rank at such young ages.\u201cMaster, how can you be sure if you don\u2019t try\u2026 ?\u201d Ye Linyun asked carefully.\u201cYes, Feng Hanyue has already reached the peak seventh rank and Zhao Feng has a better memory than Bei Moi.\u201d Third Guard said unwillingly.After all, these geniuses were all nurtured by him.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 83": "Chapter 83Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 83 \u2013 Future PotentialIn the hall, the youths were on their tiptoes.Zhao Feng scrunched up his eyebrows, he refused to believe that not a single one of the Ten Sky Guards had been looked upon by Lord Guanjun in just one glance.\u201cThe nine ranks of the Martial Path are just a foundation. At this place, strength, cultivation and skills aren\u2019t important if you can\u2019t reach the next realm.\u201d Lord Guanjun\u2019s voice sounded in the hall.The words seemed half understood and half weird to the youth\u2019s ears. Only a few were able to comprehend the meaning of Lord Guanjun\u2019s words.\u201cAccording to him, the nine ranks of the Martial Path are only a foundation\u2026 At this stage, even if your strength is stronger than others, there\u2019s no point if you can\u2019t reach the next realm.\u201d Zhao Feng understood something.He remembered one month ago when he had talked with Master Ye.Master Ye had said: \u201cThe nine ranks of the Martial Path train the body and bones and forms the foundation.\u201dNow, Zhao Feng had remembered this deeply and he realised that the true aim of the nine rank of the Martial Path wasn\u2019t about killing or skills.\u201cThis youngster dare asks, if cultivation and strength aren\u2019t important at the nine ranks of the Martial Path, then what is?\u201d Feng Hanyue stood up and asked respectfully. As he did so a thin layer of cold sweat appeared on his back.The other nine Ten Sky Guards couldn\u2019t help but sweat too and admire his courage.Lord Guanjun seemed to have a good impression of Feng Hanyue: \u201cStrength is secondary at this stage because the future is most important. A path that can lead you further!\u201dFuture.A path that can lead you further!Zhao Feng immediately understood. When one had reached the level of Lord Guanjun they had different views.Giving an example: A martial artists may be the strongest throughout his rank, but if he doesn\u2019t have the potential and can\u2019t break through to the seventh rank to become a martial master, then there\u2019s no point in him being the strongest in the sixth ranks. And thus, they won\u2019t be raised by these factions.This also meant that a glance of Lord Guanjun had seen the potentials of the Ten Sky Guards and that he didn\u2019t look heavily upon their current strength right now.Obviously, those who had better potential usually had higher cultivation which was why he would choose a disciple from the Ten Sky Guards.\u201cAlthough I say this, you still need to be tested.\u201d As Lord Guanjun said this, he took out a transparent ball sized crystal about the size of a fist.This ball was made out of a unique material. Under his signal, Bei Moi took the crystal ball and gave it to the Ten Sky Guards.\u201cIt\u2019s that thing!\u201d Nan Gongfan felt his heart jump.That year he had came with Bei Moi to the Spiritual Martial Hall, Lord Guanjun had also taken this out.Lord Guanjun said: \u201cThis is a special item in the world as it can measure one\u2019s future potential. It can estimate your future potential to around ninety-nine percent.\u201dHearing this, the youths couldn\u2019t help but feel nervous.\u201cAn item can even measure someone\u2019s potential!\u201d Zhao Feng was interested.At this time, Bei Moi handed the crystal ball to Feng Hanyue.\u201cClose your eyes and put your consciousness and Inner Strength into it.\u201d Lord Guanjun told him.\u201cYes sir.\u201dFeng Hanyue took a deep breath and calmed himself down. He then focused his energy onto the crystal ball in his hand.Weng~Circles of white light appeared inside the ball.One circle, two circles, three circles\u2026 five circles!\u201dThe fifth circle had turned green however unlike the first four that were white.\u201cYou\u2019ve surpassed the fourth circle, which means your potential exceeds that of a mortal body. Although it is ok, it\u2019s still not good enough to become my core disciple.\u201d Lord Guanjun said.Hearing this Feng Hanyue\u2019s eyes dimmed. He had the highest cultivation in the Ten Sky Guards, but in Lord Guanjun\u2019s eyes he was just so-so.Seeing Feng Hanyue\u2019s performance, the other geniuses felt even more nervous.Soon, it was Lei Cong\u2019s turn. Lei Cong took the crystal ball with a trembling hand and he finally sank his consciousness into it.Circles of white light appeared in the inner parts of the ball.One circle, two circles, three circles, four circles!The white circles stopped at the fourth and a fifth didn\u2019t appear at all.\u201cYour potential has reached the limits of mortals, but it is still too far away from my target.\u201d Lord Guanjun shook his head.How could it be like this!?Lei Cong\u2019s face was as black as charcoal, as if he had lost his soul.The evaluation he received was far worse than Feng Hanyue\u2019s. Feng Hanyue at least received an average evaluation.Next, it was Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s turn.\u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201dLu Xiaoyu had a solemn look on as he put his consciousness into the ball. Inside the ball, three white circles appeared then they spat out another half circle. Third and a half circles was a bit worse than Lei Cong\u2019s.\u201cA genius within mortals, but it is not enough in the real world stage.\u201d Lord Guanjun shook his head.Apart from Feng Hanyue, the other two didn\u2019t even reach Lord Guanjun\u2019s limits.\u201cThe potential of Lu Xiaoyu and Lei Cong are top tier in Sun Feather City, but they are worthless here.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s heart clenched.He was also thinking what Lord Guanjun meant by the real world stage. After Lu Xiaoyu, it was Zhao Yufei\u2019s turn.Zhao Yufei closed her eyes and held the crystal with her jade-like hands.Weng~Circles were released in the inner part of the crystal, but three circles appeared then five then four, it was extremely unstable and the color wasn\u2019t white nor green.\u201cHm?\u201dLord Guanjun went into deep thought. Zhao Yufei\u2019s situation was different from the other youths.\u201cCould it be Yufei\u2019s potential is unique?\u201d Zhao Feng thought.Lord Guanjun opened his mouth after some thought: \u201cYour potential is special, but it shouldn\u2019t surpass Feng Hanyue\u2019s.\u201dReceiving such an evaluation, Zhao Yufei let out a breath.After Zhao Yufei finished it was the fifths turn, then the sixths, then the sevenths\u2026The youths after didn\u2019t even reach Lord Guanjun\u2019s bottom line.\u201cIt\u2019s my turn.\u201d Huang Qi took over the crystal from Bei Moi with trembling hands.Soon, three and a half circles appeared within the crystal. His potential was on par with Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s and he was still top tier in the Ten Sky Guards, but he was nowhere near good enough for Lord Guanjun.Failed!Huang Qi was depressed, he was the top genius of Pearl Tree City and he wanted to show off his skills in Province City, but he didn\u2019t even reach Lord Guanjun\u2019s minimum standard.It was Li Ziwen\u2019s turn after Huang Qi.Li Ziwen was the youth who was in Lu Xiaoyu\u2019s team during the mission.\u201cI\u2026 \u201dLi Ziwen was extremely nervous and he wasn\u2019t able to calm down.Pah!Bei Moi slapped his back and Li Ziwen felt his blood cool down. Li Ziwen\u2019s testing was useless, he had only three circles.\u201cNext.\u201d Lord Guanjun said expressionlessly.Next?Zhao Feng\u2019s heart jumped. It was finally his turn.The last of the Ten Sky Guards was Zhao Feng.At this time, the gazes of everyone present turned to him. At this moment, Zhao Feng could feel Zhao Yufei\u2019s expectations and confidence. He could feel Third Guard and Ye Linyun\u2019s smiles.They had high hopes for Zhao Feng\u2019s potential as Zhao Feng had reached the seventh rank and he was one of the youngest amongst the Ten Sky Guards.Before that, Zhao Feng had gotten first in the kill mission and he had memory that surpassed even Bei Moi\u2019s.Bei Moi handed over the crystal ball to Zhao Feng with interest in his eyes. He had a deep impression of Zhao Feng as he was the only person who could beat him in terms of memorising.He was slightly depressed after losing to Zhao Feng that day. Now he was going to see how strong Zhao Feng\u2019s potential was.\u201cMaster, this is the youth who\u2019s memory is better than Bei Moi and the one who got first in the bandit clearing mission. Not only that, he\u2019s also the youngest one amongst the Ten Sky Guards.\u201d Third Guard said in a low voice.\u201cOh?\u201dCuriosity and interest flashed in Lord Guanjun\u2019s eyes.Under the gazes of everyone, Zhao Feng took the crystal and put his consciousness as well as his Inner Strength into it.Weng~The first circle immediately appeared.What\u2019s happening!?Zhao Feng heart jumped because he found that after the one circle appeared the next formed very slowly. Even when he fully put his consciousness into it, only one and a half circles were formed.Hm?The people watching stiffened. Zhao Feng\u2019s potential shouldn\u2019t be any weaker than Feng Hanyue\u2019s.Lord Guanjun was disappointed and he was about to say something.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPeh Peh! Peh Peh\u2026Zhao Feng suddenly heard a jumping sound from within the depths of his left eye that sent out sizzles of heat throughout his body.Weng~The white circles that had stopped moving suddenly moved forward again and reached two circles.After two circles was reached, the white circles kept on forming. Two circles\u2026 three circles\u2026 Three and a half circles\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

The circle suddenly condensed then stopped again, then jumped again.The change made the hearts of those watching clench. Lord Guanjun immediately swallowed what he was going to say, the change had almost caused him to give a wrong evaluation. After all, this was his first time seeing something like this.Only Zhao Feng knew in his heart that his potential didn\u2019t exceed two circles.Two and a half circles \u2026 Three circles\u2026 Three and a half circles\u2026Under the heat of his left eye, the amount of circles reached three and a half and still kept condensing.Three and a half\u2026 Four circles\u2026 Four and half circles\u2026Many of the people held their breaths. Four and a half circles was the best in the Ten Sky Guards excluding Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei. Zhao Feng realised that five circles was a whole entire level, but after the fourth and a half circle was condensed progress slowed down. Suddenly, another pulse of heat was released from his left eye.Four circles and a half\u2026 Five circles!A faint green color appeared as the fifth circle condensed. This was the limit that Zhao Feng could reach without using the powers of his left eye because he knew Lord Guanjun would be able to sense it.\u201cThe fifth circle has appeared, but it\u2019s slightly weaker than Feng Hanyue\u2019s. It should be a half spiritual body.\u201d Lord Guanjun\u2019s expression turned normal once again.It was obvious that Zhao Feng\u2019s potential was just below Feng Hanyue\u2019s and it didn\u2019t give him a surprise.\u201cHalf spiritual body? Not good enough.\u201d Bei Moi took the crystal with disappointment in his eyes.It was obvious that he had overestimated Zhao Feng.\u201cMaster, which ones are you going to take?\u201d Third Guard asked.\u201cNot one of them are good enough to be my core disciple.\u201d Lord Guanjun shook his head.Up to now, the only one that pleased him was Bei Moi. Hearing this, the youths all turned bitter.\u201cBut this generation of Sky Guards Battalion is indeed stronger than before. Some of them can become my outer disciples.\u201d Lord Guanjun\u2019s words twisted.Outer disciple?Feng Hanyue and co.\u2019s eyes lit up.Although it was highly unlikely to become a core disciples, it was still a dream to become his outer disciple. Lord Guanjun was a legend in the Cloud Country, even Martial Masters begged pointers from him. If they could become his outer disciple, they would have the chance to receive teachings from him.Furthermore, Third Guard and Ye Linyun were only his outer disciples.\u201cOuter disciples? Which ones?\u201d Ye Linyun asked.\u201cThese two both have a Spiritual Body so they have no problems becoming my outer disciple.\u201d Lord Guanjun looked at Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei.\u201cHow about Zhao Feng? He\u2019s the youngest here and he has a high cultivation, his memory is better than Bei Moi\u2019s, he also came first in the mission\u2026 \u201d Ye Linyun quickly said.Zhao Feng was the genius he took from Sun Feather City and he had high expectations of him.\u201cIt\u2019ll be hard with his half-spiritual body\u2026 \u201d Lord Guanjun said after some thought.But seeing that both Third Guard and Ye Linyun seemed to praise him, he couldn\u2019t help but laugh: \u201cOh well, let him be. Taking three disciples in at once breaks my record.\u201dAs Lord Guanjun decided, Ye Linyun and Third Guard smiled at Zhao Feng. Zhao Feng also returned grateful looks.\u201cMaster, you won\u2019t regret taking him in.\u201d Ye Linyun said confidently.\u201cOh?\u201d Lord Guanjun didn\u2019t know where Ye Linyun\u2019s confidence came from.Ye Linyun didn\u2019t explain. He remembered the aura Zhao Feng that had released when performing his skills back at the Zhao family. It was something that most ninth ranks couldn\u2019t do and at that time, Zhao Feng was only at the fifth rank.\u201cFeng Hanyue, Zhao Yufei, Zhao Feng. From today onwards, you\u2019ll become outer disciples of Lord Guanjun.\u201d Third Guard announced.\u201cYou don\u2019t need to be so formal since you\u2019re just outer disciples.\u201d Lord Guanjun smiled faintly.His sight scanned across Zhao Feng and the other two before resting on Bei Moi. It was only then did he give a true smile. Zhao Feng and the others understood that outer disciples would only occasionally receive pointers. Sometimes, outer disciples would not get anything at all.Lord Guanjun only had Bei Moi as a core disciple and it was the latter that would be fully raised by him. After the Master-Disciple ceremony, the other seven Ten Sky Guards left.Soon, there was only Lord Guanjun and his disciples left in. Third Guard and Ye Linyun had their own assignments and left.Therefore, there was only Bei Moi, Nan Gongfan, Feng Hanyue, Zhao Yufei and Zhao Feng left.\u201cYou can all ask me a question since you\u2019ve become my disciples today.\u201d Lord Guanjun opened his mouth and said.Questions?Feng Hanyue, Zhao Yufei and Zhao Feng were excited. They obviously had many questions to ask this legendary figure.\u201cMaster, what is a Spiritual Body?\u201d The first person that asked was Feng Hanyue.Spiritual, Mortal Body.This was what Zhao Feng heard from Lord Guanjun before.\u201cThere\u2019s hundreds of billions of people on this continent and their potential is decided when they\u2019re born. Over ninety-nine percent of humans are normal and they have Mortal Bodies.\u201d Lord Guanjun explained the concept of Mortal Body.Zhao Feng understood what he meant. Most of the people in this world had Mortal Bodies. For example, before Zhao Feng merged with the eye, he had a hundred percent Mortal Body. But after the merging of the mysterious left eye, his blood and potential were all affected and it became a half Spiritual Body.\u201cThe mortal body is split into different tiers: Low, Middle, High and Limit. This means that there are also differences between Mortal Bodies. In the test, just then one circle meant Low Tier Mortal Body, two meant Middle Tier Mortal Body\u2026 Four circles meant Limit Tier Mortal Body\u2026 \u201d Lord Guanjun continued.Zhao Feng had never heard anything like this before.\u201cThe fifth circles means the Spiritual Body. People with Spiritual Bodies have an advantage compared to those with Mortal Bodies. Those geniuses will reach the Holy martial path in just a matter of time depending on how good their masters are.\u201d Lord Guanjun finally explained what Mortal and Spiritual Bodies meant.This increased Zhao Feng\u2019s knowledge. He estimated that Zhao Linlong was around three circles and a half, between the High Tier and Limit Tier of a Mortal Body.Next, Zhao Yufei asked Lord Guanjun a question.Zhao Yufei had asked: \u201cMaster, is there realms above the Holy Martial Path?\u201dHearing to this question, Zhao Feng showed interest as well. Back when he stayed in Sun Feather City, they only knew of the Martial Path; the Holy Martial Path was just a rumour. Facing Lord Guanjun Zhao, Feng thought that he had reached the Holy Martial Path.Then, were there realms above the Holy Martial Path?\u201cYes.\u201dA light flashed in Lord Guanjun\u2019s eyes as he spoke solemnly: \u201cBut this is a level you can\u2019t touch\u2026 \u201dHearing this, Zhao Feng and the other two felt their hearts move. There was higher realms above the Holy Martial Path!Soon, Zhao Feng asked a question.\u201cWhat is most important in the nine ranks of the Martial Path?\u201d\u201cThe body is the most important. The point of the martial path is to strengthen the blood, bones and organs. The true use of Inner Strength isn\u2019t to kill people, but it is used to strengthen one\u2019s own body. On this point, many cultivators have gone on the wrong path.\u201d Lord Guanjun smiled.No wonder. Zhao Feng was now certain of his thoughts before.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMaster, what\u2019s your point in raising so many geniuses?\u201d Zhao Feng asked the question that bugged him most.Ever since he had entered the Guanjun Palace, he heard others saying Lord Guanjun loved geniuses and he would send his men around the country to take them in.He and Zhao Yufei were found by the Guanjun Corps and Ye Linyun had come personally to take them in. Zhao Feng\u2019s question made Lord Guanjun\u2019s body stiffen and a cold light shone in his eyes. In an instant, Zhao Feng and the others felt a pressure bear down upon them.Lord Guanjun had clearly not done anything, he didn\u2019t even release a bit of his aura, but the pressure from his mental energy caused the others to tremble. Luckily, this feeling only lasted an instant. Even then, cold sweat appeared on Feng Hanyue\u2019s forehead.\u201cZhao Feng! This question has nothing to do with you! Master takes in geniuses because he loves them. Do you think that master has a purpose?\u201d Nan Gongfan shouted with anger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Master takes in geniuses because he loves them. Do you think that master has a purpose?\u201d Nan Gongfan shouted with anger.Zhao Feng\u2019s question made Bei Moi and Feng Hanyue scrunch their eyebrows too. Indeed, Zhao Feng\u2019s question wasn\u2019t a question regarding cultivation. Zhao Feng also realised that this question seemed to go off track.\u201cThis is the first time that someone has asked me a question like this.\u201d Lord Guanjun\u2019s expression turned back to normal and he glanced at Zhao Feng.At his level, he obviously wouldn\u2019t get angry over such a thing.Master was indeed nice.Nan Gongfan and the others let out a breath. Lord Guanjun didn\u2019t seem to get angry.Through Zhao Feng\u2019s question, the others were all interested too. Feng Hanyue and Nan Gongfan were all smart, they knew that Lord Guanjun didn\u2019t go find geniuses just because he liked to, there was a purpose.Lord Guanjun slowly stood up with his hands behind his back and sighed as he stared out into the sky.Zhao Feng saw the change in helplessness, hate and expectations in Lord Guanjun\u2019s eyes as he sighed. It seemed that when he sighed, Lord Guanjun had experienced the four seasons of a year.\u201cThese years, I have been finding and raising geniuses for a wish of mine. It is something that I can\u2019t do myself, I need to rely on the younger generation to do.\u201dLord Guanjun then scanned the faces of the youths present and then he looked at Bei Moi with expectations and hope.A wish?Something that Lord Guanjun can\u2019t even do?The youths looked at each other, shocked. Everyone knew that Lord Guanjun had peak power in the Cloud Country. What was something that even he couldn\u2019t do?\u201cWhat is Lord Guanjun\u2019s wish?\u201d Zhao Feng was even more and more curious.He didn\u2019t believe that Lord Guanjun couldn\u2019t do something.\u201cYou may all leave.\u201d Lord Guanjun sighed and signalled with his hand.Then, he sat back down on his futon leaving just his core disciple Bei Moi behind.\u201cMaster, I\u2019ll definitely complete your wish.\u201d Bei Moi promised.\u201cIt\u2019s good that you have the heart. From today onwards, I\u2019ll teach you all my secret skills\u2026 \u201d Lord Guanjun smiled.Today, ten geniuses entered the Spiritual Martial Hall to test their potential. Without a doubt, Feng Hanyue\u2019s performance was indeed superb, but it was still incomparable to to Bei Moi.\u2026..Outside the Spiritual Martial Hall.The outer disciples of Lord Guanjun walked out together.\u201cBrother Zhao, you\u2019ve got guts! How did you manage to ask a question like that? You need to understand that even martial masters of the ninth rank act humbly before Master.\u201d Nan Gongfan said in a disciplining tone.\u201cThank you for telling me.\u201d Zhao Feng said.He had just become an outer disciple of Lord Guanjun and although he didn\u2019t want to offend Nan Gongfan, he wouldn\u2019t take his orders. Zhao Feng\u2019s performance made Nan Gongfan unhappy but he couldn\u2019t go into a fit right now, so he remembered it in his heart.It was Zhao Yufei who got some information out of Nan Gongfan\u2019s mouth.Nan Gongfan said: \u201cI need to warn you that Brother Bei Moi has superb talent. He\u2019s extremely arrogant and he doesn\u2019t allow others to beat him, so don\u2019t go challenging him.\u201dZhao Feng felt the same as he heard this. When he had beaten Bei Moi in memorising, the latter was unhappy.\u201cMay I have Brother Nan how good is Bei Moi\u2019s talent for Master to take him in as a core disciple?\u201d Feng Hanyue had unfairness in his voice.Even though he was the top genius in the Sky Guards Battalion, he wasn\u2019t even close to becoming a core disciple.\u201cHaha, if you saw Bei Moi\u2019s potential back then, you wouldn\u2019t have said this.\u201d Nan Gongfan laugh had bitterness and jealousy in it.\u201cHow many circles were condensed when it was Bei Moi\u2019s turn?\u201d Zhao Yufei asked curiously.They needed around five circles to become Lord Guanjun\u2019s outer disciple.\u201cAt that time, my test result was five and a half circles\u2026 \u201dNan Gongfan seemed to remember the scene three years ago when he entered the Spiritual Martial Hall with Bei Moi.\u201cFive and a half? That\u2019s more than us.\u201d The unfairness in Feng Hanyue\u2019s heart disappeared.\u201cHowever, compared with Brother Bei Moi\u2019s, mine was rubbish. His was\u2026 Eight and a half!\u201d Nan Gongfan took in a deep breath as jealousy, helplessness, and unwillingness appeared in his eyes.Eight and a half circles!Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei were dazed. Zhao Feng\u2019s heart shook, eight and a half circles!Bei Moi\u2019s talent was a monster. No wonder Lord Guanjun looked at Bei Moi so importantly. At this moment, the geniuses finally realised the difference between Bei Moi and them.After leaving Spiritual Martial Hall Feng Hanyue, Zhao Yufei and Zhao Feng returned to the Sky Guards Battalion.On the same day, they used their identities as disciples of Lord Guanjun to move into better accommodation in the Guanjun Palace.\u201cCongratulations to both of you for becoming Lord Guanjun\u2019s disciples. I hope that you won\u2019t forget me.\u201d Huang Qi said sourly with an admiring look.At this moment, Huang Qi couldn\u2019t help but sigh. He remembered how he hadn\u2019t put the two in his eyes when they had first met, but now the two were far above him.After the two packed their stuff, they went to visit Third Guard.\u201cNow that we\u2019re all under the same Master, you can come to me if you need any help.\u201d Third Guard gave a faint smile.\u201cCan I ask brother\u2019s name?\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know Third Guard\u2019s true name.\u201cBeing a Guanjun Corp, Third Guard is my name now.\u201d The overseer of the Sky Guards Battalion seemed as mysterious as ever.Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei were slightly stunned and they left Third Guard after a while. After becoming a disciple of Lord Guanjun, the treatment they received was far better than most others within the Guanjun Palace.On the same day.Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei both moved into a building of their own. The building that Zhao Feng moved into had two Martial Artists as guards.\u201cGreeting, Young master Zhao!\u201d The two guards bowed.\u201cGreeting, Master.\u201d Seven to eight servants stood there respectfully.The building was three stories high and it had a small garden.\u201cThe treatment here exceeds even what the Elders of the Zhao sect get.\u201dZhao Feng clicked his tongue.If this was half a year ago, he would never have imagined that Martial Artists would be his guards. Just being the disciple of Lord Guanjun, he got thirty thousand silver and some free resources.After moving into his new house, Zhao Feng took a nice shower and he started to cultivate again. Returning Breath Technique was something that he never stopped training. After training, Returning Breath Technique for a bit, he then moved onto Silver Wall Technique. Silver Wall Technique was the only Holy martial art he had and it could increase his strength significantly.Zhao Feng remembered what Lord Guanjun had said at daytime: \u201cThe point of the nine ranks of the Martial Path is to strengthen one\u2019s blood, bones and organs. The true purpose of Inner Strength isn\u2019t to kill but to strengthen one\u2019s body. On this point, many cultivators have gone on the wrong path.\u201dIt was easy to see that the true purpose of the martial path was to train one\u2019s body and foundation, which made Zhao Feng even more dedicated to training Silver Wall Technique.Once the Silver Wall Technique reached the tenth level, his body would exceed the limits of mortals and he won\u2019t even need to worry about the power released when trying to reach the Holy martial path.For the next few days, Zhao Feng focused on Silver Wall Technique , Returning Breath Technique and other skills such as Star Finger and Smoking Transparent Step. But the progress of Silver Wall Technique was just too slow after it broke through to the sixth rank.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNot only that, Body Strengthening Techniques needed time and effort to slowly build up.\u201cResources can speed up the progress of body strengthening techniques.\u201d Zhao Feng thought.He organised his items and he found that there was four hundred thousand silver in his pockets.Hm? That\u2019s heaps!Zhao Feng stood dazed for a second before remembering that all these items came from the bandits he slew, especially the seventh rank one. That person alone gave him two hundred to three hundred thousand silver.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

He had never dreamed of having so much money before. Back at the Zhao sect, his allowance was only twenty silver per month.\u201cI can probably buy many resources to help my Silver Wall Technique\u2026 \u201c Zhao Feng thought.Soon, he walked out of the Guanjun Palace, somewhere where he hadn\u2019t been before. The size of the Province City far exceeded Sun Feather City. Cultivators and carriages could be seen everywhere.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t even need to ask directions of the market, he went with the flow and arrived there. Hundreds of metres away, he saw a shop with the sign \u2018Medicine Pavilion\u2019 on it.\u201cThe power behind Medicine Pavilion is indeed strong. They even have a shop in the Province City.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes lit up with joy.He had gone to the Medicine Pavilion a few times back in Sun Feather City and he knew the quality of goods they had there were high.\u201cThree Forest Moonlight Grass\u2026 Precious Snow Jade Marrow\u2026 Bone Connecting Pilll\u2026 Final Seven Poisonous Snake Guts\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng was dizzy just by looking at the variety of items.Shua! Shua!Zhao Feng opened his left eye and he scanned all the items. In an instant, he had memorised all the names, appearances and descriptions.The thousands of pills, medicines and resources would take a Martial Learner years to memorise, but Zhao Feng only used a few breaths to seal them into his mind.He then closed his eyes and scanned through the items in his head to try to find what he needed.\u201cIs there anything you need?\u201d A martial learner came over and said respectfully.He had sensed that Zhao Feng\u2019s aura was much stronger than the others.\u201cEn.\u201dZhao Feng soon said: \u201cThree packs of Bone Strengthening Powder, Three Blood Condensing Body Strengthening Pills, Three Chi Storage Pills and one Sun Gathering Pill.\u201dHe immediately called out four items.The martial learner trembling asked: \u201cAre\u2026 are you sure you want these?\u201d\u201cBone Strengthening powder, one of the best resources to help body strengthening techniques costs around thirty-nine thousand silver per pack!\u201d A nearby cultivator exclaimed.Zhao Feng had asked for three at once.\u201cLittle friend are you sure you\u2019re not kidding?\u201d A middle aged pill master walked over and released his sixth rank aura.\u201cMao Pill Master!\u201d The nearby pill makers and learners looked at him respectfully.Immediately, the situation here caused the attention of many others.\u201cKidding? I don\u2019t have such a habit.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled faintly.Mao Pill Master walked over and calmly said: \u201cFriend, these precious items add up to a total of forty thousand silver. Are you sure you can afford it?\u201dIt was obvious that Mao Pill Master didn\u2019t believe that Zhao Feng had that much silver.Forty thousand silver!The nearby customers took in cold breaths and sighed. They wouldn\u2019t have thought that the few items a fourteen year old youth called out would cost forty thousand silver.\u201cYes.\u201d Zhao Feng stared back at the pill master.Hmph!Anger appeared on Mao Pill Master\u2019s face because if Zhao Feng was actually buying it, the high level of the Medicine Pavilion would appear.Although Mao Pill Master didn\u2019t shout, his sixth rank aura expanded.\u201cDo you think that I don\u2019t have the right to do so?\u201d Zhao Feng said coldly as a chaotic Inner Strength was released from him.Instantly, the air seemed to freeze and the customers nearby had a feeling of being suffocated. Mao Pill Master stiffened and he felt that his Inner Strength had been suppressed. Luckily, the aura lasted for only a second before fading away.Apart from the nearby seven to eight people, no one else felt it.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201dA pill learner didn\u2019t even know what had happened.Cold sweat appeared on Mao Pill Masters back: \u201cPlease follow me to the second floor.\u201dAccording to the rules of Medicine Pavilion, if twenty thousand silver\u2019s worth of goods were to be exchanged, they had to go to the second floor.The change in attitude by Mao Pill Master made some people curious, but there were a few that had felt the powerful aura that came and disappeared in an instant.\u201cMartial\u2026 Martial master\u2026 \u201d A cultivator of the fifth rank mumbled bitterly to himself.But because his voice was too soft, no one else heard him. Those that knew the truth felt shocked, as if they had lost their souls. Mao Pill Master looked deeply at Zhao Feng then raised his hand. He had never seen such a young Martial Master before. Once one became a martial master, they would be looked up in awe by martial learners and martial artists.Martial Masters weren\u2019t just symbols of power, they were symbols of status as well. But this youth of only fourteen years old had already reached this level!\u201cNo need, I\u2019m busy. Just trade here.\u201d Zhao Feng shook his head.This immediately made Mao Pill Master slightly awkward, but he couldn\u2019t go against it, so he had to exchange right here.\u201cBone Strengthening Powder, thirty nine thousand a pack, three packs = 117 thousand; Blood Condensing Pills one pill 32 thousand silver, three pilver 96 thousand silver; Chi Storage Pills one pill 44 thousand silver, two pills 88 thousand silver; Sun Gathering pill 80 eighty thousand silver each\u2026. It all comes to a total of three hundred and eighty one silver!\u201d Mao Pill Master announced.Three hundred and eighty one thousand silver!The nearby customers took in cold breaths. One had to know that one whole deadly beast was only worth thirty thousand silver and they had to risk their lives and go into the depths of the Sky Cloud Forest to do so.Even Martial Masters wouldn\u2019t dare to enter the depths of of the Sky Cloud Forest.\u201cHere\u2019s the silver.\u201d Zhao Feng took a thick pile of silver out and put it on top of the bench.\u201cThe number\u2019s correct.\u201dMao Pill Master could confirm if it was legal tender or not by looking if there was a stamp of the thirteen country pact. The thirteen country pact included the Cloud Country and the Maple fire country.This pact was also called the Sky Cloud Thirteen Country pact and they all used the same currencies for easier trading.Soon, Mao Pill Master and two others went to grab what Zhao Feng wanted.\u201cBone Strengthening Powder x 3 packs, Blood Condensing Pills x 3, Chi Storage Pills x 2, Sun Gathering Pill x 1\u201d Zhao Feng confirmed nothing was wrong.\u201cThis youth can take out such a wad of cash.\u201dThe eyes of a few cultivators in the Medicine Pavilion twinkled. Two of them even followed him with dim faces. They didn\u2019t know Zhao Feng\u2019s true cultivation.\u201cMao Pill Master, that customer\u2026 \u201d A pill learner saw that something was wrong.\u201cThe customer\u2019s safety outside of the Medicine Pavilion has nothing to do with us. Apart from that, this customer\u2019s cultivation and background\u2026 \u201dMao Pill Master didn\u2019t worry for Zhao Feng. A fourteen year old Martial Master must have a strong background.As soon as Zhao Feng walked out of the pavilion, he sensed two people following him. He gave a cold laugh, but he didn\u2019t bother with them.Being the disciple of Lord Guanjun, he could do almost anything he liked in the Guanjun Province because his master was the overlord here.\u201cYoung master.\u201dAs soon as Zhao Feng entered the Guanjun Palace, the head guard of the sixth rank came over and greeted him. Eight martial artists including the head guard stood respectfully.Maybe the normal guards weren\u2019t aware of Zhao Feng\u2019s background, but the head guard had some connections and he knew Zhao Feng\u2019s identity.\u201cGuanjun Palace!\u201d The two following behind him jumped.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euTeng!

The Bone Strengthening Powder was similar to the other powder he had used before, it was just hundreds of times better.\u201cI heard that the Bone Strengthening Powder has extremely good effects for body strengthening techniques. I wonder if it\u2019ll be of use for my Silver Wall Technique.\u201d Zhao Feng started to soak in the medicine water.The boiling hot water could easily burn through the skin of normal people, but it had no effect on Zhao Feng\u2019s strong body.Gulugulu!The water suddenly started bubbling and it turned into a purple-red color like a flower blossoming. Zhao Feng felt a searing pain come from his body and it slowly seeped into his blood and marrow.\u201cWhat a powerful medicine!\u201dCold sweat appeared on Zhao Feng\u2019s forehead but he managed not to scream. According to what it said on the Bone Strengthening Powder\u2019s packet, normal seventh ranks needed to split one packet in half and use them separately. Zhao Feng was confident that his Silver Wall Technique was a top tier body strengthening technique and so he used a whole packet instead.He didn\u2019t know that his body had been changed by the mysterious eye and that he could absorb more of the medicine in at once.Peh Peh! Peh Peh!Zhao Feng felt sizzles of heat being released from his left eye, which cooled his whole body down. And it allowed him to absorbed the medicine at a faster rate.The amount and speed at which he absorbed the powder was at least two times faster than others, which was why he felt that the medicine was extremely powerful and pure.For a few hours, Zhao Feng suppressed the pain which would make a normal person faint.Half a day later, Zhao Feng finally adjusted to the pain. At this time, he slowly circulated Returning Breath Technique, which helped him absorb the medicine more evenly.One whole day and night later.Zhao Feng was finally able to take in all of the medicine, but there were still some remnants inside his body.\u201cNo wonder it\u2019s a precious body strengthening item\u2026 \u201cZhao Feng felt that the increase in Silver Wall Technique was very obvious. Before, Silver Wall Technique had just stopped progressing when it had reached the sixth level.This was exactly just like what Third Guard had said: \u201cHoly body strengthening techniques are easy to learn, but as it progresses, it gets harder.\u201dIt was good that Zhao Feng\u2019s body had undergone a change by merging with the mysterious left eye, which increased the rate medicine was absorbed at.After using one packet of Bone Strengthening powder, Zhao Feng thought about the other resources that he had at hand: Sun Gathering Pill, 3 x Blood Condensing Pill and 2 x Chi Storage Pills.The Blood Condensing Pill also helped improve the body.He remembered what Lord Guanjun had said deeply, that the nine ranks of the martial path focused on the body.The use of Chi Storage Pills was to purify one\u2019s Inner Strength and he bought them for his Returning Breath Technique. The last Sun Gathering Pill cost eighty thousand silver and it could increase the cultivation of men who trained the Yang laws.Body, Inner Strength, Cultivation.The four items Zhao Feng had bought were focused on all three with the first being the most important.Next, Zhao Feng ate a Blood Condensing Pill, which could strengthen the body. This pill also took Zhao Feng another two to three days time to fully absorb.After taking in this pill, Zhao Feng felt that both his body and Silver Wall Technique increased in power.According to the order, the next one he was going to eat was the Chi Storage Pills. Under the fact that his body foundation was extremely strong, Zhao Feng felt that his Inner Strength increase by leaps and bounds. This made him fully aware of the fact that the foundation must be solid.For the next half of a month, Zhao Feng concentrated solely on Silver Wall Technique and Returning Breath Technique.The three packets of Bone Strengthening Powder, the three pills of Blood Condensing Pills and the two Chi Storage Pills had all been used up.At this time, his Silver Wall Technique had reached the late stages of the sixth level. At this level, Zhao Feng\u2019s body was as strong as silver and when he activated Silver Wall Technique, a faint silver glow would appear on his body as if he was an undefeatable statue.\u201cEven if I don\u2019t use Inner Strength, I can face normal seventh ranks with no problems.\u201d Zhao Feng thought.This was only at the sixth level, if he reached the seventh, he could wipe out almost any martial master of the seventh rank unless the opponent had learned a Holy martial art as well.Next, Zhao Feng was going to eat the Sun Gathering Pill.Zhao Feng left this till last because he wanted to strengthen his foundation which would help him absorb it better.Closing his eyes, Zhao Feng ate the Sun Gathering Pill. After reaching the seventh rank, the progress of Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation had slowed down. Immediately, Zhao Feng felt a surge of hotness spread throughout his body.The energy of this pill needed to be slowly released and absorbed. Zhao Feng took a full seven to eight days with the circulation of Returning Breath Technique nonstop to take in all the energy.Eight days later.Zhao Feng had absorbed almost all of the energy. At this time, the green light in the dimension of his left eye had reached seven foot six.A months hard work had not made Zhao Feng\u2019s cultivation reach the peak seventh rank.\u201cI can\u2019t believe that Bei Moi\u2019s almost at the ninth rank since cultivation slows down so much after the seventh.\u201d Zhao Feng thought in his heart.It was good that his Silver Wall Technique had reached the peak sixth rank and it set a solid foundation for him, which gave him confidence that he could reach the eighth rank in three months time.Hu!Zhao Feng could feel the power within him as he breathed in and our. Now, the quality and quantity of his Inner Strength had increased dramatically.\u201cNo seventh rankers should be my opponent now. I might even to be able to take on some normal eighth rankers, but there\u2019s no chance of winning if I meet a monster like Bei Moi!\u201d Zhao Feng estimated his strength.He could challenge those of the eighth rank and he might even have a chance at winning if they were normal cultivators of the eighth rank. If they were prodigies like Nan Gongfan or Bei Moi, they would have at least half-Holy ranked martial arts. He could not beat them as the latter also had the strength to challenge those of higher ranks.Like Bei Moi, he had already killed a cultivator of the ninth rank.\u2026..Zhao Feng finally came out of secluded mediation after one month.At this time a servant reported to him: \u201cYoung master, while you were in secluded meditation, Lady Zhao Yufei and Young Master Feng Hanyue both have come to find you.\u201dOh?Zhao Feng stretched his body while walking out of his house slowly. Feng Hanyue\u2019s house and Zhao Yufei\u2019s house were not far away.Soon, the three met together.\u201cBrother Zhao, it seems that you\u2019ve improved quite a bit in one month.\u201d Feng Hanyue gave a faint smile and he was slightly curious.\u201cStill not good enough compared with Brother Feng.\u201dZhao Feng found that Feng Hanyue had almost reached the limit of the seventh rank, not tarnishing the name of the top genius of the Ten Sky Guards.Zhao Yufei had increased by leaps and bounds as well, reaching the seventh rank.Today, the three youths discussed their skills and the other wanted to spar. Zhao Feng didn\u2019t reject this notion either and sparred with the two.The final result was that Zhao Feng fought Feng Hanyue to a standstill, while Zhao Yufei lost by a bit.Throughout the sparring, Zhao Feng used only sixty to seventy percent power of his Silver Wall Technique and he slightly conserved the power of his other skills such as Star Finger and Smoking Transparent Step.Even then, Zhao Feng was surprised at Feng Hanyue\u2019s strength as the latter may have hid his strength too. But the one who was shocked was Feng Hanyue; he wouldn\u2019t have thought that just after one month, Zhao Feng would be able to fight on par with him.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euWhile they were sparring, Zhao Feng realised that both Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei had trained in a few half-holy ranked martial arts as well.\u201cBeing disciples of Lord Guanjun, we can go to the Treasury Hall and choose a total of ten half Holy martial arts.\u201d Feng Hanyue told him.This news made Zhao Feng jump with joy. No wonder Third Guard and Bei Moi didn\u2019t seem to put half Holy martial arts in their eyes.The advantage they gained by being a disciple of Lord Guanjun was just too big Zhao Feng decided to go to the Treasury Hall when he had time.\u201cOh yeah, I forgot to tell you that Nan Gongfan invited us to spar with each other in three days and Bei Moi will be there as well\u2026 \u201d Feng Hanyue said.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 88": "Chapter 88Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 88 \u2013 Sparring (1)Zhao Feng was looking forward to the sparring because he didn\u2019t know how strong the others were. There was still two to three days left until then and before this, Zhao Feng needed to go to the Treasury Hall.The Treasury Hall held many books including books on history, medicine and martial arts. The books here were super rare. But being the disciple of Lord Guanjun. Zhao Feng could read them at any time he wanted.Zhao Feng went to the martial arts section where the highest ranking books reached the half-Holy rank. Half Holy ranks were quite rare even for martial masters. If one didn\u2019t prove their worth, they had no right to receive them. However, Zhao Feng could come here and read any of them, but he could only take out ten books. Using his left eye, Zhao Feng quickly read all the books he was interested in.Up to now, all his martial arts were technically half holy martial arts. The skills that Zhao Feng got from Bei Moi and Third Guard were all top tier half Holy martial arts. Especially Returning Breath Technique, it was almost a Holy martial art.\u201cIt looks like I don\u2019t need to choose another half Holy martial art now.\u201d Zhao Feng concluded.If there was a problem, it would be Star Finger. But if it was merged with Partial Wind Stance, it would be extremely powerful and he didn\u2019t want to spend too much time to focus on another offensive skill. Zhao Feng would rather spend more of his energy on the four Wind Stances: Flowing Wind Stance, Tornado Stance, Partial Wind Stance and Burning Wind Stance.Now that Zhao Feng had almost fully learnt Flowing Wind Stance, he moved onto Tornado Stance.Ever since he saw the Holy martial arts, he faintly realised that these four Wind Stances weren\u2019t normal. Just an incomplete stance had a lot of power.Inside the dimension of his left eye, Zhao Feng could open the memories of many scenes including the four Wind Stances and the Mysterious Wind Palm. Zhao Feng found that the two complemented each other and were similar in many ways. He then took out all the skills that he thought were interesting and copied them into his mind to expand his knowledge.After that, he then moved onto the history and geography section. Since he was born in a weak branch clan, Zhao Feng didn\u2019t have much knowledge of the outside world. The geography and history were limited to the Sky Cloud Thirteen Countries.\u201cThe Sky Cloud Forest is huge\u2026 It expands over thirteen countries\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng was slightly stunned.Just as the name said, the Thirteen Countries had a pact to team up to face the enemy.What kind of enemy would need thirteen countries to team up? Zhao Feng quickly browsed through the history books.\u201cFor the past thousand years, the thirteen countries have been caught between two strong countries: Sky Rich Country and the Metal Blood country. The two countries have been at war for millennia and if any one of them wins, it means the destruction of the thirteen countries\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng was shocked when he said this.A long time ago, he thought Sun Feather City was already huge and that the Cloud Country was just a dream. But now the thirteen countries, including the Cloud Country struggles to survive between the two strong countries.Once the balance between the two were broken, the thirteen country pact would be destroyed.\u201cHm? Northern Continent?\u201dZhao Feng found that the geography book said that the two strong countries were just one of many in the Northern Continent. For the next half a day, Zhao Feng digested the information he learnt. But somehow, just somehow, he felt that the book had only touched a corner of a mountain.Three days passed in a blink of an eye.That morning, Feng Hanyue, Zhao Yufei and Zhao Feng all came to Nan Gongfan\u2019s house. Lord Guanjun actually had tens of outer disciples, but only five to six of them were of the same generation including Nan Gongfan, Feng Hanyue, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei. Apart from them, there was a youth called Yang Qingshan around sixteen to seventeen years old, who was at the eighth rank.\u201cHaha! Brother Nan Gongfan, aren\u2019t you going to introduce these new faces to me?\u201d Yang Qingshan shouted loudly and seemed very enthusiastic.Nan Gongfan felt a headache coming as he introduced the three to Yang Qingshan.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t that kiddo Bei Moi here? This guy is training the Rippling Skill, I hope he goes insane\u2026 hahaha\u2026 \u201d Yang Qingshan laughed.The few around the same age were all here except Bei Moi.In that time, Yang Qingshan\u2019s mouth never stopped. Nan Gongfan felt helpless, but Yang Qingshan was stronger than him.\u201cHe\u2019s here!\u201d Yang Qingshan exclaimed.An expressionless youth walked in, it was Bei Moi.\u201cBrother Bei, you\u2019re finally here.\u201d Nan Gongfan let out a breath.Bei Moi glanced at the others then sat down and started cultivating again. While Zhao Feng and the other two were confused, Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan all acted if this was normal.The disciples all discussed what they had learnt and sometimes, they showed off their skills. In the midst of this, it was mainly Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan talking, while the other three chipped in once in awhile. As for Bei Moi, he was like a block of wood who just sat there and cultivated.Soon, the youths decided to spar.\u201cWho want\u2019s to play with me?\u201d Yang Qingshan said enthusiastically.\u201cI will!\u201dFeng Hanyue walked out and faced Yang Qingshan and the latter suppressed himself to the peak seventh rank.The two figures clashed in a small area.Mountain Striking Stance!Yang Qingshan suddenly used a Holy martial art and thrust a palm out, causing the air to ripple.\u201cHeavenly Illusion Stance!\u201dFeng Hanyue used his incomplete Holy martial art and instantly, his figure became like the moon, blurry and fast, but he was still pressured by Yang Qingshan.Around twenty moves later, Feng Hanyue was sweating and this was with Yang Qingshan suppressing his cultivation.After that, Zhao Yufei went up and exchanged a few moves with Yang Qingshan with the latter suppressing his cultivation to her level as well.Although Zhao Yufei performed better than expected, she still lost thirty or so moves later.\u201cYang Qingshan has trained many half-Holy martial arts to a high level and he seems to also have complete Holy martial arts as well.\u201dAfter Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei lost, it was Zhao Feng\u2019s turn.It\u2019s my turn?Zhao Feng stood up.\u201cHehe let me go!\u201d A smile appeared on Nan Gongfan\u2019s lips as he took Yang Qingshan\u2019s place.Yang Qingshan felt slightly curious, why would Nan Gongfan come out and face Zhao Feng? But he didn\u2019t decline him and gave the spot to Nan Gongfan.Zhao Feng knew that his words had displeased Nan Gongfan last time when they were leaving the Spiritual Martial Hall.\u201cBrother Zhao Feng, relax, I\u2019ll suppress my cultivation to the seventh rank, the same as you.\u201d Nan Gongfan said righteously.Shua!Zhao Feng didn\u2019t bother with any words and he instantly appeared behind Nan Gongfan. The entire process was in complete silence.So fast!Zhao Yufei and Feng Hanyue were surprised. Zhao Feng had used Smoking Transparent Step, whose speciality was silence.Star Finger!Zhao Feng immediately used his Star Finger of the peak fourth level, which spat out a line of azure light.\u201cNot bad!\u201d Nan Gongfan smiled and casually waved his sleeve which easily minced up Zhao Feng\u2019s attack.So casual!Zhao Feng was filled with solemness, the opponent had probably trained a Holy martial art which could instantly destroy his Star Finger.After resolving the attack, Nan Gongfan then pushed out his palm and sent circles of white air at Zhao Feng. The latter wanted to dodge, but he felt a force stopping him.In the center, Nan Gongfan sucked in all the dirt, leaves and branches.\u201cZhe zhe, Brother Nan Gongfan\u2019s Godly Suction Force seemed to improve again.\u201d Yang Qingshan laughed.One Line Star Finger.Zhao Feng pushed forwards instead of retreating and using the pulling force, he immediately used the killing move of Star Finger.Tong! Tong! Tong\u2026Zhao Feng\u2019s finger was repeatedly stabbed out and it sent rays of beautiful azure light.\u201cThe power is indeed strong but has no effect against me.\u201d Nan Gongfan laughed as he stood on the same place and swiped his hands.Hu~ Hu~Layers of white air waves started to spin around Nan Gongfan\u2019s body. When Zhao Feng\u2019s attacks reached him, the power would decrease and finally fade away.Just as Zhao Feng was able to sink into a dangerous situation.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euFlowing Wind Stance!Zhao Feng\u2019s figure suddenly merged into the layers of white air and he seemed to be one with it.One Line Star Finger!Zhao Feng\u2019s attacks seemed to rely on the wind.\u201cThis brat can resolve my Holy martial art!\u201d Nan Gongfan\u2019s expression finally changed.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Flowing Wind Stance made his speed and offensive both improve dramastically.Nan Gongfan\u2019s Godly Suction Force used Inner Strength to control the wind and create a tornado, but Zhao Feng used his Flowing Wind Stance to resolve this and it caused Nan Gongfan\u2019s face to turn slightly dim.Being under the same master, he wanted to teach Zhao Feng a lesson but he didn\u2019t expect the opponent to be so troublesome.\u201cWhirlpool Tornado!\u201dNan Gongfan exclaimed as the original tornado suddenly became chaotic and pushed out in every direction. The force in the wind could easily shatter a house into pieces.What a terrifying move!Zhao Feng felt his chest get crushed and the wind tear towards his clothes.\u201cIs this the power of a Holy martial art?\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s left eye squinted as he tried to sense the change in Inner Strength of Nan Gongfan. His Silver Wall Technique of the peak sixth level stood solid against the destructive air wave.Hmm?Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye found the pattern and profoundness behind Nan Gongfan\u2019s moves and he found that it was similar to his Tornado Wind Stance.He then opened the ability of his left eye and copied this scene into his mind.Shua!Instantly, a scene of Nan Gongfan using his Whirlpool Tornado appeared in the dimension of his left eye. Inside the dimension, the scene could be played out tens of times slower and it could be viewed from different angles.Soon, Zhao Feng found that the insights of this skill were similar to the Tornado Stance.\u201cFifth move \u2013 Star Finger!\u201dZhao Feng moved with the wind and he sent out a piercing finger which left dots of green light behind. In an instant, the damage of Star Finger had increased dramatially.Fifth level of Star Finger!Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei were both shocked. Star Finger was famous in the Cloud Country for being hard to train and having major risks.This skill had a total of seven levels. If one reached the fourth, they could release their Inner Strength out of the body without even reaching the seventh rank. When it was trained to the fifth level, the attacks would be like a meteor, fast and beautiful. What made it even more terrifying was that Zhao Feng could see the flaws in Nan Gongfan\u2019s Godly Suction Force and so he aimed there.\u201cHow did this guy make it happen\u2026 ?\u201dNan Gongfan\u2019s expression finally changed as he quickly exploded his layers of wind.Boom\u2014-A three metre hole was made where the two exchanged blows.At a certain point, Nan Gongfan\u2019s cultivation had exceeded the limit of the seventh rank.Teng!Zhao Feng\u2019s figure landed on the ground unharmed. Because his Silver Wall Technique had reached the peak sixth level, he could almost take any hit from Nan Gongfan head on if the latter suppressed his cultivation below the eighth rank.\u201cThanks.\u201d Zhao Feng smiled as he returned back to his seat in silence.\u201cBrother Zhao Feng! We haven\u2019t finished yet.\u201d Nan Gongfan was slightly angry.\u201cI mean seriously. Brother Nan Gongfan, your cultivation just exceeded Brother Zhao Feng\u2019s then. As an older brother, you shouldn\u2019t use higher cultivation to beat him, right?\u201d Yang Qingshan\u2019s voice sounded.It was obvious that if the two were both at the same cultivation and rank, Nan Gongfan couldn\u2019t beat Zhao Feng.\u201cI underestimated him. Next time, I will spar seriously with Brother Zhao.\u201d Nan Gongfan said as he returned to his seat.Spar seriously?Zhao Feng took in the meaning of these two words. If they sparred seriously, it would mean that Nan Gongfan wanted to use his eighth rank cultivation.Within the room, the disciples didn\u2019t know that the sparring had not gone unnoticed.\u201cBrother Ye, this Zhao Feng is better than expected. His Silver Wall Technique has reached the peak sixth level and a troublesome skill such as Star Finger has also reached the fifth level. Not only that, he seems to have insights into a Holy martial art\u2026 \u201c Third Guard was slightly surprised.\u201cHaven\u2019t you thought about who brought him here?\u201d Ye Linyun said confidently.The two had seen the battle between Zhao Feng and Nan Gongfan. Zhao Feng\u2019s performance was better than expected.\u201cHm, not bad. It looks like my eyes failed me this time.\u201d A voice sounded in the two\u2019s ears.\u201cYes.\u201d Third Guard and Ye Linyun nodded their head instinctively.Ah! Wait! No\u2026The next instant, the two jumped up and exclaimed: \u201cMaster!\u201dTurning around, there was not a single figure around. But Lord Guanjun\u2019s voice definitely sounded in their ears.The two scanned their surroundings and they found Lord Guanjun sitting cross legged on a tree a couple hundred of metres away. His aura seemed to be one with the tree and without paying close attention, it was easy to miss him.The sparring between the disciples had not only gone into Third Guard and Ye Linyun\u2019s ears, it had also reached Lord Guanjun.But thinking about it, it was pretty logical as Guanjun Palace was the domain of Lord Guanjun. Everything that went on here wouldn\u2019t escape his mind and these people were his disciples.\u201cMaster\u2019s taking this sparring so seriously.\u201dThird Guard and Ye Linyun glanced at each other and saw the shock in each other\u2019s eyes.Lord Guanjun\u2019s eyes focused on Bei Moi more. Each and every one of them performed well with Zhao Feng giving a little surprise. But obviously, Lord Guanjun cared about his core disciple, Bei Moi, the most.\u201cBei Moi, we haven\u2019t fought in a long time.\u201d Yang Qingshan suggested.In terms of strength, Yang Qingshan was slightly stronger than Nan Gongfan and hr was placed behind Bei Moi.Zhao Feng and the other\u2019s had interested looks too. Bei Moi was a monster in their eyes.\u201cSolo combat, too boring.\u201d Bei Moi stood up and didn\u2019t reject the notion of fighting.\u201cYou mean\u2026 \u201cThe eyebrows of both Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan twitched. Zhao Feng faintly knew what Bei Moi was getting at.\u201cAll five of you can come at once.\u201d Bei Moi\u2019s voice was calm as if he was just saying a trivial thing.What! All at once?The youths present were all shocked. At the same time, expressions of anger appeared on Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan\u2019s faces.\u201cWhat? Are you too afraid?\u201dBei Moi walked slowly in between the five people.\u201cFine!\u201dFeng Hanyue walked into the battle circle. Immediately, Yang Qingshan and Nan Gongfan followed and surrounded Bei Moi. Because Zhao Feng and the other two had lower cultivation, they stood a bit further away.The atmosphere was extremely tense.Bei Moi had reached the peak eighth rank, while the other side had two eighth ranks and three seventh ranks.\u2018Is he being too arrogant?\u2019 Zhao Feng thought.At this moment, Third Guard and Ye Linyun held their breaths as they focused on the battle.\u201cGodly Suction Force!\u201dNan Gongfan led the attack and thrust out a palm of white air circles towards Bei Moi.Hu~A deadly pulling force immediately appeared on Bei Moi\u2019s body, but the latter stood as still as a rock.It was like his two feet were lodged deeply into the ground.\u201cAvalanche!\u201d Yang Qingshan exclaimed as he send a powerful palm towards Bei Moi.He and Nan Gongfan were the main attacks, while the other three were the supporters.Star Finger!Illusion of the Broken Moon!Dance of a Thousand Leaves?Zhao Feng, Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei attacked from the side. Of the three, Zhao Feng\u2019s move could threaten eight rank while the attacks of the other two were almost able to.Immediately, a barrage of attacks went towards Bei Moi.\u201cGood! Ripple of Destruction\u2026 \u201cBei Moi stood still and suddenly opened his arms. As he did so, ripples of Inner Strength swept towards his surroundings.Craaaack\u2026 Boom\u2026The attacks of Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan were immediately dissolved and another ripple sent them flying.Wah!Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euNan Gongfan immediately spat out a mouthful of blood, while Yang Qingshan turned pale and sustained internal injuries.Baam\u2026 Baam\u2026 Baam\u2026Another ripple immediately dissolved Zhao Yufei, Feng Hanyue and Zhao Feng attacks and it sent the first two flying.Shua~The remaining energy sent up a layer of dust, which blocked the scene\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Cough!The dust even blew into Third Guard and Ye Linyun\u2019s faces. The two looked at each other and they saw the shock in each other\u2019s eyes.The power of the six great prodigy\u2019s was on the same level as cultivators of the ninth rank. At this moment, a smile appeared on Lord Guanjun\u2019s face as he stared at the dust zone.The centre of the dust wave.Bei Moi stood there with his feet half an inch in the ground, everything within sight destroyed.Around him, there were a few youths pale faced with Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan receiving internal injuries. On the other side, Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei had been slightly injured too. There was only one exception. In the outer edges of the dust zone, there was one stood standing there uninjured with a solemn expression.\u201cThis guy\u2019s strength is stronger than most cultivators of the ninth rank\u2026 \u201c Zhao Feng stared at Bei Moi.Ever since he had entered the main Zhao family and the Province City, he had never met a genius so talented. Maybe only Xin Wuheng would be able to fight with him.As the dust settled, the situation was seen.Bei Moi stood expressionlessly and said casually: \u201cI only used sixty percent of my strength just then.\u201dSixty percent!The geniuses present wanted to say something, but nothing came out.Was this his true strength?A bitter smile appeared on Feng Hanyue\u2019s face, he had finally realised why Bei Moi could become Lord Guanjun\u2019s one and only core disciple, whereas he could only become an outer disciple. He hadn\u2019t realised that the difference between the two would be so big.\u201cIn just a months time, Brother Bei Moi\u2019s strength is almost the same as me now.\u201d Ye Linyun sighed.In the building, the bunch of youths opened their mouths, but nothing came out.Dead silence.On the tree far away, a smile appeared on Lord Guanjun\u2019s face: \u201cSoon, it will be time\u2026 \u201dA while later.\u201cAye, Brother Bei Moi, you\u2019re too strong.\u201d Yang Qingshan said helplessly while jealously flashed in Nan Gongfan\u2019s eyes.It was only Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei who were calm because the difference in cultivation between them were big.\u201cBrother Zhao Feng.\u201d Suddenly, Bei Moi turned to face Zhao Feng.Hmm?Zhao Feng stiffened, what was it?The gazes of the youths landed on him.\u201cDid you fire that finger just then?\u201d Bei Moi stared at him and waved his sleeve.The youths squinted and saw that there was a tiny hole on Bei Moi\u2019s sleeve. Obviously, this was just limited to Bei Moi\u2019s sleeve. His arm didn\u2019t even have a mark on it.How did he do it?Even then the others were surprised. When they had exchanged moves, Bei Moi had used a wide range attack that had even reduced Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan\u2019s attack to nothing before it even got close to him.Under the shocked gazes, Zhao Feng gave a faint smile: \u201cMaybe I was just lucky.\u201dLucky?Suspicion rose in Yang Qingshan\u2019s eyes, only Zhao Feng wasn\u2019t injured. Not only that, his finger attack had pierced through the flaw on Bei Moi\u2019s move and left a tiny hole there.If he did only one of them, then it might\u2019ve been luck. But if the two points were added together, the chance of it being luck was extremely low.\u201cHm!\u201dThird Guard and Ye Linyun were slightly shocked. The scene before was too chaotic and they didn\u2019t notice this.It was Lord Guanjun on the tree who murmured: \u201cWhat unbelievable perception, to be able to catch Bei Moi\u2019s flaw in a blink and attack it in the chaos.\u201dThe only one that knew the truth apart from Zhao Feng and Bei Moi was Lord Guanjun. Lord Guanjun had analysed what had happened, he too didn\u2019t notice it before.\u201cLucky?\u201dBei Moi didn\u2019t question him further, but he was slightly irritated. He had wanted to defeat all six geniuses in one hit with a perfect ending. Not only did that not happen, he had also received a nail thick hole in his sleeve.This was the only mark that tarnished him. Ever since he had been taken in by Lord Guanjun as a core disciple, he hadn\u2019t lost to anyone in any aspect amongst his generation. Zhao Feng was the first person to do so. First, he was defeated in terms of memorising and now, a mark had appeared on his clothes.The sparring between the disciples ended here.Lord Guanjun, Third Guard and Ye Linyun all left. Every disciple had gained something and so, they all quickly went back to their houses to cultivate.On the way back, the image of Bei Moi\u2019s move surfaced in Zhao Feng\u2019s mind.Way too strong!Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t find any way to fight him straight on and Bei Moi had only used sixty percent of his strength just then. Zhao Feng opened his left eye and he found that Bei Moi\u2019s cultivation was extremely close to the ninth rank and his Inner Strength was even better than his Returning Breath Technique.After analysing the fight, Zhao Feng could confirm that Bei Moi had trained three to four Holy martial arts at least. In the midst of it, the Rippling Skill was stronger than most Holy martial arts and it made Zhao Feng realise there were differences among Holy martial arts. Soon, he remembered some contents he had memorised in the library.\u201cThe Holy Martial arts are split into low grade, medium grade, high grade and peak grade. The skills I saw that day at the Treasury Hall should be all low grade.\u201dInside Zhao Feng\u2019s mind, there was a huge amount of knowledge. Two days ago, he had copied a limitless amount of knowledge into his mind in, most of which hadn\u2019t been digested yet.\u2026\u2026.Returning back to his place, Zhao Feng started to gain insights on what he had learnt today. The essence of Flowing Wind Stance had been taken in by him. Apart from that, he had also gained some insights into Tornado Stance.Hu!Zhao Feng circulated Returning Breath Technique and around him came the sound of whistling air.Star Finger!Zhao Feng stabbed out and the simple finger caused the surrounding wind to blow in that direction.\u201cIt\u2019s like this, Flowing Wind Stance helps speed skills while Tornado Stance helps offensive skills and creates wide range attacks.\u201d Zhao Feng gained more insights.The four stances were Flowing Wind Stance, Tornado Stance, Partial Wind Stance and Burning Wind Stance with each stance getting deeper and stronger. Up to now, Zhao Feng had learnt fifty to sixty percent of Tornado Stance. If he was right, Burning Wind Stance and Partial Wind Stance were both offensive skills.For a few days. Zhao Feng stayed in his room.A certain day.Zhao Feng opened his eyes.\u201cYoung master Zhao, Master Ye Linyun tells you to go to him, there\u2019s an important meeting.\u201d A servant called out.Usually, the servant wouldn\u2019t disrupt him unless something was urgent. Zhao Feng walked out of his room and he asked for directions.The gathering point was the Sky Guards Battalion.Soon, Zhao Feng arrived at the middle of the field. When he arrived, there were many people there already and the two sitting at the head seat were Third Guard and Ye Linyun respectively.The rest were all of Lord Guanjun\u2019s outer disciples and the new Ten Sky Guards.When everyone had arrived.\u201cSir Third Guard, what happened?\u201d A youth asked.Third Guard responded: \u201cThis mission has a few connections with the previous killing mission.\u201dKilling mission?Zhao Feng was slightly surprised, didn\u2019t they slaughter all the bandits before?The other youths present were also curious. Zhao Feng then thought, if this was just another killing mission, why would Bei Moi, the core disciple, show up?\u201cIt\u2019s like this. After we left the bandit zone, large amounts of wild and deadly beasts started to attack the nearby villages and they formed a beast horde with the intention of destroying Guanjun Province City.\u201d Ye Linyun said the reason.Beast horde?The youths were all shocked.Why would the bandit zone have a random beast horde?Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but think of the scene when he had pursued the Wolf Leader. At that time, Zhao Feng saw a hooded figure and a few high tier deadly beasts.\u201cThe size of the beast horde is extremely big. There\u2019s a large amount of low tier deadly beasts and a few high tier deadly beasts which have already destroyed a few villages and they have started to threaten Guanjun Province City.\u201d Ye Linyun said solemnly.High tier deadly beasts?The hearts of the youths clenched. There were many rumours of high tier deadly beasts.Zhao Feng had personally experience how powerful the Two Winged Sword Teeth Tiger was, any one of them would be able to destroy a village and even threaten some small cities.\u201cThe Guanjun Province City has already sent troops, but it\u2019s still not enough. The beast horde this time is also a chance for you. Lord Guanjun has ordered you all to defend it.\u201d Third Guard said.Defend?The youths all let out a breath.\u201cOnly through battle will your potential be ignited.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s attitude was on the bright side.Just as the people were discussing.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euRoar~~~~~~~~~~~A piercing scream sounded above the Guanjun Province City.\u201cWhat\u2019s the situation? Has the beast horde already arrived at the Guanjun Province City?\u201dZhao Feng\u2019s heart jumped.He opened his left eye and saw that there was an enormous golden bird in the sky, the aura it released was even stronger than that of the Two Winged Sword Teeth Tiger.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Plop\u2026\u2026Those that weren\u2019t cultivators immediately fainted. Zhao Feng used his enhanced vision and he saw an enormous golden bird twenty to thirty miles away. The golden eagle was similar to the Metal Beak Eagle he had seen in Sky Cloud Forest, but many many times larger. Just the wingspan alone reached ten metres.\u201cNot good! That\u2019s the famous Golden Beak Eagle King from the Sky Cloud Forest who rules the skies!\u201d A few cultivators in the city recognised the golden bird.Golden Beak Eagle was a high tier deadly beast which could rival cultivators of the ninth rank.Hu~The Golden Beak Eagle King swept towards the city wall in a flash.\u201cAh\u2026 \u201cInstantly, seven human cultivators were ripped into shreds. The strongest cultivator of the seven that had been killed had reached the seventh rank and he didn\u2019t even see the Golden Beak Eagle King incoming.Qiu! Qiu Qiu\u2026At this time, a cloud of golden light came from the far away. That cloud of golden light was made up of thousands of Golden Beak Eagle, who were comparable to human Martial Artists.\u201cDefend!\u201d\u201cThe beast horde is here, go report this to the Guanjun Palace!\u201dThe Guanjun Province City erupted in chaos as everyone started shouting and screaming.Sky Guards Battalion.The youths all heard that heart-piercing scream, but they didn\u2019t have Zhao Feng\u2019s enhanced vision and therefore, they couldn\u2019t see the scene twenty to thirty miles out.\u201cIt looks like there\u2019s a high tier deadly beast near here.\u201d Ye Linyun seemed to sense something and glance in that direction.\u201cLong story short, from now onwards, you will all help defend against the beast horde and there will be battle points awarded for how many beasts you kill. For regular beasts, every one you kill will get you 1 point, while a high tier deadly beast gives you 20\u2026 \u201d Third Guard announced.After telling them what to do, Third Guard and Ye Linyun led the youths out.When the group reached the city wall\u2019s they were shocked. In sight was the horde of wild and deadly beasts in the sky and ground.Just the deadly beasts alone, there was a few thousand and hundreds of thousands of wild beasts.\u201cSo fast! The beasts are already here.\u201d Ye Linyun took in a deep breath.It was good that the martial artists and troops had already arrived here and they started to kill some of the attacking beasts but the problem was the Golden Beak Eagle\u2019s in the sky. It was similar to the Metal Beak Eagles but it was much stronger, even normal arrows wouldn\u2019t be able to break their defense.It could be said that the Golden Beak Eagle was an evolved version of the Metal Beak Eagle.Ding\u2026 Ding\u2026 Ding\u2026A rain of arrows landed on the Golden Beak Eagles and they gave off the sound of clashing metal. But the arrows shot by martial learners weren\u2019t even able to break the defense of the Golden Beak Eagles.Sou!Zhao Feng took his Golden Stairs bow out and shot down two Golden Beak Eagles in one arrow.One arrow two eagles!The nearby archers were slightly surprised since the archer was only a youth fourteen years old.\u201cEveryone, go join in the battle. Archers, take care of the beasts in the sky. Other cultivators follow the troops and fight the beasts outside.\u201d The general of Guanjun Province City ordered.The troops were able to defeat normal wild beasts, but only cultivators could fight the deadly beasts.\u201cGo!\u201dThe youths of Sky Guards Battalion joined in the battle and fortified the defenses.The beast horde was an opportunity to ignite one\u2019s potential while earning battle points at the same time. The disciples of Lord Guanjun immediately charged towards the nearby wild and deadly beasts.Nan Gongfan, Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei had all reached the seventh rank or higher and they could easily kill tens of wild beasts in one hit, but there was just too many.Sou\u2013 Sou\u2013 Sou\u2013Zhao Feng kept firing his Golden Stairs Bow and every arrow would pierce through two to three deadly beasts. Maybe because he had killed too many, the other wild beasts all charged towards him red eyed.Watch out!The nearby archers exclaimed.\u201cThese bastards also have intelligence?\u201d Zhao Feng was slightly surprised, but he didn\u2019t fear them.Star Finger!Zhao Feng repeatedly stabbed out his finger and rays of beautiful green light appeared, which instantly destroyed a large number of birds. But this also caught the attention of the stronger beasts.Qiu~Suddenly, a scream was heard and looking up, a high tier deadly beast led a group of Golden Beak Eagles towards Zhao Feng.\u201cStop them!\u201d The expression of the nearby cultivators changed.That high tier deadly beast was of the eighth rank and once they charged into the city, havock would be caused.Star Finger! Tornado Stance!Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes were sharp as he sent out a beam of azure light that spread into a wide range attack.Tock! Tock! Tock\u2026Instantly, five or six Golden Beak Birds fell down to the ground, dead. What was even more shocking was that every Golden Beak Eagle had been pierced through the throat.Boom\u2014\u2013Zhao Feng clashed with the Golden Beak Eagle and he was perfectly fine while the Golden Beak Eagle had been pushed back.\u201cThis youth is so strong! Already at the seventh rank at such a young age!\u201d The nearby cultivators were shocked.Zhao Feng found that the Golden Beak Eagle he just faced was even stronger than the Two Winged Sword Teeth Tiger and it was almost at the ninth rank.Zhao Feng would take down at least two birds with one arrow each and every time.Roar~~~~~~Outside the gate, there were five other high tier deadly beasts, or better expressed as peak tier beasts, that arrived. These beasts were all comparable to the ninth rank and they killed tens of people with every hit.Zhao Feng saw those beasts with his left eye and he purposely avoided them as these beasts were all much stronger than the Two Winged Sword Teeth Tiger.\u201cTrembling Ripple Kill!\u201dA shout came from a youth as the figure faced a peak tier deadly beast.Boooom~~~~~That small youth was able to fight on par with that gigantic peak tier deadly beast. The nearby cultivators were all stunned.Bei Moi!Zhao Feng and the others saw that familiar figure face deadly beasts of the ninth rank with only his peak eighth rank cultivation.Peak tier deadly beasts were just too terrifying, they would destroy everything if they entered the city.Teng! Teng! Teng\u2026Ye Linyun, Third Guard and their fellow ninth rankers all flew out of the city and met their respective opponents. A total of five to six ninth ranks were sent out from Guanjun Province City, the same number as the peak tier deadly beasts, but the Golden Beak Eagle King had no opponent as it was just too fast.Although cultivators of the ninth rank were strong, they still weren\u2019t able to fight with the Golden Beak Eagle King in midair as it was the latter\u2019s domain.\u201cThis bastard!\u201dThe archers on the city wall had a headache as they watched the Eagle King. If it was just a normal beast, they could all release their arrows at once and kill it. But the defense of the Eagle was just too strong. With the Golden Beak Eagle King\u2019s lead, hundreds and thousands of Golden Beak Eagles zoomed towards the city wall.\u201cAhhhh\u2026 \u201dEvery wave of attack would take away the lives of many soldiers.\u201cTell all the archers to fire at those bastards\u2026 \u201cOn Top of the Guanjun Province City wall stood a middle aged man who gave the orders.This person was the general of Guanjun Province City, who had reached the peak ninth rank himself and he had just slain a peak tier deadly beast not long ago, boosting the morale of their side. But facing the Golden Beak Eagle King the general could do nothing against it. The Golden Beak Eagle King was fast, strong and it fought only in the air.\u201cGeneral Heng, if we don\u2019t slay the Golden Beak Eagle King, our side will fall into chaos sooner or later.\u201d Ye Linyun spoke as he landed next to the general covered of blood.Just then he had successfully killed a peak tier deadly beast but he had been injured as well.Qiu\u2026Suddenly, the Golden Beak Eagle King turned into a blur and pounced on a human cultivator of the ninth rank with speed like lightning.\u201cWatch out!\u201dThe general and Ye Linyun both warned. The human was fighting another peak tier deadly beast at the time and he thought \u201ccrap\u201d as he heard the warning.Shua\u2026 Tonk!The sharp claws of the Golden Beak Eagle King pierced through the ninth\u2019s ranks Inner Strength shield.\u201cAhhhhhhhh!\u201dThe human screamed then he was ripped into shreds by the two deadly beasts.Seeing the scene, Zhao Feng\u2019s heart turned cold.Bastard!Both General Heng and Ye Linyun clenched their teeth.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cGeneral Heng, we must kill this bird no matter the cost!\u201dColdness appeared on Ye Linyun\u2019s face. It was just too hard to raise up a human cultivator of the ninth rank. A small city alone might not even give birth to one in tens of years.\u201cWe must attract it to the ground somewhere then ambush it.\u201d General Heng thought.\u201cHow are we supposed to kill it if most archers can\u2019t even break it\u2019s defense?\u201d Ye Linyun said bitterly and helplessly.\u201cGathering all the best archers\u2026 \u201d General Heng\u2019s murderous voice echoed in a radius of a few miles.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 92": "Chapter 92Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 92 \u2013 Archery SkillsSoon, the best archers were gathered near General Heng. Some of them were at the fifth and sixth rank, while others were at the seventh and eighth.The group was full of middle aged people apart from Zhao Feng.Zhao Feng was slightly curious as he stood in the group of people. The others nearby had pushed him over here before he knew what was going on.\u201cAll you need to do is attract the Golden Beak Eagle King near the city\u2026 \u201dGeneral Heng told them his plan.The plan was simple, to annoy and hurt the Golden Beak Eagle King and attract it\u2019s attention. Then kill it with the combined power of a few ninth ranks.\u201cThis is probably\u2026 \u201d The seven to eight archers were slightly hesitant.\u201cWhat!? Can\u2019t you all do a simple thing like this?\u201d General Heng said coldly.The archers immediately started to sweat.\u201cGeneral, it\u2019s like this. The Golden Beak Eagle King\u2019s speed is too fast. Furthermore, when it moves, it also drags the wind along with it. So before the arrows come near, it will automatically swerve.\u201d One middle aged archer said helplessly.He was an archer that had reached the seventh rank and his words caused agreements from the other people. Zhao Feng\u2019s eyesight was better and clearer, so therefore, he knew how difficult it was.Firstly, the speed of the Golden Beak Eagle King was too fast and when it moved the wind would disrupt the arrow\u2019s movement. Secondly the defense of the Golden Beak Eagle King was just too strong, and it could take an attack of an eighth rank and be fine.Not only that, the archers had to shoot from the ground while the Eagle King was in the sky.Obviously, there was still one more point.What if they managed to hurt the Eagle King? The archers had to attract it to the ambush area as well.Normal cultivators of the seventh and eighth rank would instantly be ripped into shreds. Therefore, the archers present had no confidence at all.Right at this time.\u201cAhhhh\u2026 \u201dThe golden blur of the Eagle King swiped down again and killed tens of people.Shua!After killing them, the Eagle King turned in another direction.\u201cBrother Bei Moi watch out!\u201d Ye Linyun and Yang Qingshan exclaimed.This time, the Golden Beak Eagle King was soaring towards Bei Moi. Bei Moi was fighting another peak tier deadly beast and he heard the wind whistling behind him.\u201cSpiritual Crane Flying Wind!\u201dBei Moi used a profound speed skill and his body became like a crane and flew into the air. It was a Holy martial art!Qiu~The Golden Beak Eagle King screeched and clashed with Bei Moi in midair.Boom!The attack of the Golden Beak Eagle King had been blocked, but Bei Moi had been slightly injured. After the Golden Beak Eagle King failed to kill him, the Eagle King then disappeared again to find a new target.\u201cThis bastard. If Brother Bei Moi dies\u2026 \u201d Ye Linyun wiped the cold sweat off his forehead.Sou\u2013 Sou\u2013 Sou\u2014At this time, the best archers fired their arrows at the Golden Beak Eagle King.Ding! Ding\u2026.A few of the arrows managed to raise sparks on the wings of the eagle but the defense wasn\u2019t broken at all. The expressions of the archers were slightly dim.\u201cUnless we hit a vital point\u2026 \u201d The archers shook their heads.Ding! Ding! Ding\u2026Suddenly, another few arrows hit the Golden Beak Eagle King, but none of them broke through the tough as metal feather.Failed again!The archers had bitter expressions.Zhao Feng used his Golden Stairs Bow, but the situation was the same. The arrows that got near the Eagle were put off course by the wind from the Eagle\u2019s flapping.Qiu\u2014The Golden Beak Eagle King suddenly swept downwards towards the nearby archers.\u201cAhh\u2026 \u201dThe archers were pale-faced as they tried their best to dodge but two people still died.Lightly Floating Ferry!Zhao Feng first used his speed skill, then he took out his Golden Stairs Bow and with a \u201cpah\u201d, flattened two low tier deadly beasts and pushed back a high tier deadly beast.Compared to all the other archers, Zhao Feng was extremely calm.Hmm?At this time General Heng had also noticed Zhao Feng and he was surprised that the latter was so calm in a situation like this.\u201cBrother Zhao, you specialise in the bow?\u201d Ye Linyun had also noticed Zhao Feng.\u201cYes, maybe I can do it.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded and appeared in front of Ye Linyun.\u201cYoung master Zhao, are you sure?\u201d General Heng had a solemn expression.If Zhao Feng was just a normal archer, he wouldn\u2019t mind him giving it a try, but Zhao Feng was a disciple of Lord Guanjun, the responsibility would be beared by him.\u201cIf it\u2019s just to attract it down, then it\u2019s not much of a problem.\u201d As Zhao Feng said this, he slowly pulled open the Golden Stairs Bow and decided to prove his words with action.Hu~He took a cold breath as a faint green light appeared on his eyebrow and the Eagle became much slower and clearer in his eyes.Shua!Under the enhanced vision mode, Zhao Feng could see the change in the birds bone and blood.He stood still and focused in on the Eagle King, but he didn\u2019t release his arrow.\u201cNot simple!\u201dGeneral Heng and Ye Linyun looked at each other. They both felt the sharp, piercing aura from Zhao Feng.Qiu!Suddenly, the Golden Beak Eagle King turned around.Sou! Sou! Sou\u2014Zhao Feng immediately released his arrows. It was like the Eagle King was heading towards the arrows and not the other way around.Finally,the three golden arrows and the Eagle King clashed together.Yep! Clashed!The arrow and eagle were both heading in different directions, but the two finally met together.Shuuuu~~~~~~The golden arrow pierced through the layer of wind and stabbed perfectly into the eagle\u2019s eye. This scene caused the other archers below to stare dazed.\u201cHow did he do this\u2026 ?\u201dAn archer of the seventh rank had an expression of disbelief on, he couldn\u2019t accept the fact that Zhao Feng was able to perfectly hit the eye of the Eagle King.Ding!The golden arrow raised a spark of fire as it deflected off the eyelid of the Eagle.So unfortunate!The archers couldn\u2019t help but sigh. The Golden Beak Eagle King had closed its eyes at the last second. Being a peak tier deadly beast, its reactions were insanely fast but it didn\u2019t notice the smile appearing on Zhao Feng\u2019s lips.Shu- Shu- Shu\u2014The other two arrows followed the first arrow and hit the eyelid of the bird once again,Because the first arrow had broken through the windshield, the flight path of the other two was much better.Ding!Blood leaked out of the Eagle\u2019s eye.Tok!The third arrow pierced into the eyeball.The first two arrows made the way for the third arrow. The third arrow was the killing move!Ooooooooo~~~~~~~A painful scream appeared in the skies as the Golden Beak Eagle King stared red-eyed at Zhao Feng.\u201cPrepare the ambush!\u201dZhao Feng immediately used his Lightly Floating Ferry and charged towards the ambush zone. At this time, General Heng and Ye Linyun had finally recovered from their shock.Ambush!Get ready!General Heng, Ye Linyun and a few peak eighth ranks waited.Qiu!The Eagle King charged at Zhao Feng full of anger. The latter felt a coldness appear and he knew that he had been locked on by the Golden Beak Eagle King.Smoking Transparent Step!His figure moved and merged into the crowd of the city without a trace.The Eagle King had lost Zhao Feng\u2019s figure but it knew the area that he was in and at this time, General Heng and Ye Linyun attacked.Heavenly Destruction!Dazzling Slice!The two peak ninth ranks exploded their power.Craaaaaak\u2014\u2014The furious, unsuspecting Eagle King was hit by the two ninth ranks.Ye Linyun used a Holy martial art and his palm seemed to become a blade that sliced through the defense of the bird and left eight deep gashes. General Heng\u2019s sword skill was a half Holy martial art that had been trained to the peak level and it was even stronger than the Ye Linyun\u2019s arrack.Shhhhhh~~~~~~~~Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThat sword full of killing intent almost chopped off the Golden Beak Eagle King\u2019s head.Peng.. Peng\u2026 Boom\u2026 Bam!Immediately, the seventh and eighth ranks used their most powerful skills which almost killed the bird.Qiu~~~~~~~The Golden Beak Eagle King used its last bit of strength and pounced towards a youth holding a golden bow, full of hatred.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 93": "Chapter 93Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 93 \u2013 Snatching Battle Points again?Watch out!Brother Zhao Feng!From the city wall came shouts of fear.At this moment, they knew the Golden Beak Eagle King was on the verge of death and it would die in two breaths of time, but even then, the Eagle King was going to give Zhao Feng its last strike.It was obvious that Zhao Feng had angered the Golden Beak Eagle King and the latter had the thoughts of killing him no matter what.\u201cNot good!\u201dZhao Feng felt a strong sense of danger. Under the situation, sizzles of heat were released from his left eye and spread throughout his body, which instantly calmed him down again.Hu~The speed of the Golden Beak Eagle King was terrifying and it reached Zhao Feng in the blink of an eye. That speed had exceeded the reaction of Martial Artists, even if they could see the action, they wouldn\u2019t be able to dodge it.Plaaaa!The figure of Zhao Feng was immediately torn into shreds and a massive hole was made on the wall behind him.Just as everyone thought Zhao Feng had died.Flowing Wind Stance! Smoking Transparent Step!The figure of a youth appeared on top of the Golden Beak Eagle King.What!?The nearby cultivators seemed as if they had seen a ghost.\u201cWhat a profound speed skill!\u201d Joy flashed in Ye Linyun\u2019s eyes.Just then, he had seen Zhao Feng use Smoking Transparent Step and Flowing Wind Stance at the same time and he had dodged the attack of the Golden Beak Eagle King.\u201cHe almost even tricked me\u2026 \u201dThe heart of General Heng jumped. In that instant, Zhao Feng had managed to merge Flowing Wind Stance perfectly into Smoking Transparent Step and dodged the frightening attack of the Eagle King.The merging of the Flowing Wind Stance and Smoking Transparent Step meant that it was comparable to a Holy martial art.Obviously, Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye also played a massive role due to its analysis and calculations. At this moment, Zhao Feng felt as if his blood was on fire and that his mental energy was at its peak state.Inside the dimension of his left eye, the green ray of light had extended to seven foot eight.Wait!Why did he get on top of the Golden Beak Eagle King?The nearby cultivators thought.Zhao Feng had just escaped the attack, but now, he had landed on top of the Golden Beak Eagle King.Tornado Stance! Mysterious Wind Palm!A cold light flashed in Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes as an azure light appeared on his palm which spun faster and faster and finally it flew at the head of the Golden Beak Eagle King. At that moment, his body seemed to be a tornado, angered and strong.Shuuuu\u2026His Mysterious Wind Palm hit the part where the Eagle King had been injured by General Heng.Tok! Tok! Tok\u2026The original injury became bigger and bigger.Blaaam!The head of the Golden Beak Eagle King had split into pieces and the enormous figure fell onto the ground.Teng!Zhao Feng jumped into the air with blood of the Eagle King still dripping from his palm.The rise and fall seemed to state the winner between Zhao Feng and the Eagle King.\u201cThe Golden Beak Eagle King has been killed!\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the youth that killed the Golden Beak Eagle King?\u201dWaves of chattering spread amongst the nearby watching cultivators. Zhao Feng immediately became the centre of attention.\u201cBrother Zhao Feng, well done!\u201dYe Linyun as well as Third Guard praised him.General Heng had also recovered from the shock: \u201cHahaha! Good job! You\u2019ve done a great job in killing the Golden Beak Eagle King, but there\u2019s suspicions of you snatching the battle points due to the last hit.\u201dSnatching battle points?Zhao Feng thought about it and realised that he had acted on instinct before. At that time, it was better to exchange a blow for a blow instead of dodging and running away. But in the eyes of other people, Zhao Feng was a risk taker who not only didn\u2019t run away, he had tried to earn more battle points.No matter what was said, Zhao Feng still played a huge role in killing the Golden Beak Eagle King as without his archery skills, the Golden Beak Eagle King wouldn\u2019t have been attracted down to the ambush area anyways. And the person who killed the Golden Beak Eagle King was also Zhao Feng.\u201cThe rest of the birds are easier to deal with since the Golden Beak Eagle King is dead.\u201d General Heng smiled as he looked appraisingly at Zhao Feng.Without the lead of the Eagle King, the rest of the birds in the sky was like loose sand.As for the beasts on the ground, the casualties of the humans would only increase as time went on.Zhao Feng sat crossed legged on the back lines as he recovered while the others such as Ye Linyun thought he had been injured. But, Zhao Feng had learnt the Returning Breath Technique, which meant that his Inner Strength was at least two times thicker than those of the same rank.\u201cFlowing Wind Stance\u2026 Tornado Stance\u2026 Mysterious Wind Palm\u2026 \u201dThe pictures of these three moves appeared in his mind. Flowing Wind Stance had been merged into his speed skills while the Tornado Stance had been merged into his offensive palm skill.Without knowing, Zhao Feng\u2019s understanding of the Tornado Stance had reached seventy to eighty percent. It was so good that under both the insights he had gained from the Flowing Wind Stance and the Mysterious Wind Palm, he had also understood sixty to seventy percent of Mysterious Wind Palm, which also meant that Zhao Feng\u2019s Mysterious Wind Palm was quite similar to the girl\u2019s from that day.The move just then was the combination of Tornado Stance with Mysterious Wind Palm.\u201cThis brat got another easy kill!\u201d Feng Hanyue looked at Zhao Feng with shock in his eyes.At the last kill mission, Zhao Feng had also snatched the points for killing the bandit leader and this time he was even more crazy, he had taken the kill for the Golden Beak Eagle King from the mouths of eighth and ninth rankers.In many people\u2019s eyes, Zhao Feng\u2019s acts were another example of taking the battle points of others.\u201cThat guy killed a peak tier deadly beast.\u201d Bei Moi\u2019s mouth twitched.From the start of the battle till now, Bei Moi had been fighting a peak tier deadly beast and he was even ambushed by the Golden Beak Eagle King. Under all those fights, he still couldn\u2019t kill his opponent while the new disciple, Zhao Feng had done so.Kill! Kill!The morale of the Guanjun troops increased as they managed to push back the beast horde again and again.Hu~After looking into his insights, Zhao Feng stood back up. Just then, he had reached a greater height in understanding of Tornado Stance and Mysterious Wind Palm.Furthermore. his cultivation had reached the late stages of the seventh rank.Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes scanned the waves of beasts hordes and he found that something was wrong.Something\u2019s wrong!Soon, he found the answer.\u201cThe attacks of the deadly beasts seem to be organised, the peak tier deadly beasts lead a large number of low tier deadly and wild beasts.\u201dZhao Feng saw what was wrong. If he could see this, then the high level of the Guanjun Palace could see it as well.\u201cCould this beast horde be planned?\u201d Ye Linyun, General Heng and the others were all suspicious.In the fight, Zhao Feng would take out his Golden Stairs Bow and release arrow after arrow, taking down a large number of top tier deadly beasts. Suddenly, it became a beautiful view. Rays and rays of bright green light were sent out from the city hall and with each glow of light, a few beasts would die.Zhao Feng\u2019s Archer God\u2019s Left Eye was finally honed in this beast horde.\u201cSir Zhao, can you become my master?\u201d The younger archers were extremely excited.Zhao Feng didn\u2019t know what to say and seeing that the beasts in the air didn\u2019t have much of a threat left, he went outside of the city.Star Finger! Mysterious Wind Palm!Zhao Feng was like the wind which killed beasts without sound.Plop! Plop\u2026 !Every attack of his would find the flaws of deadly beasts and a number of corpses would be left behind whereever he went.\u201cThis youth is terrifying!\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s extremely good at close combat too!\u201dThe archers watching him exclaimed. Normally, if one\u2019s forte was archery, their close combat skills weren\u2019t very good. But Zhao Feng was a monster, not only was his archery skills good, his close combat skills were too.\u201cZhao Feng\u2019s potential isn\u2019t any weaker than Bei Moi. But sadly, he\u2019s only an outer disciple of Master and he won\u2019t get all the core skills.\u201d Ye Linyun sighed and shook his head.After killing for a long time.Zhao Feng felt a familiar cold aura.Shua!He opened his left eye and found that tens of miles away, a hooded figure sat on top of a black bird. Under the hood, a pair of ice blue eyes could be seen.It\u2019s him!Zhao Feng\u2019s heart jumped, the figure was the one that he had seen that day inside the Sky Cloud Forest.Raaaaaar~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Just at this moment, a terrifying roar sounded, the aura of the roar\u2019s owner was many times stronger than the Golden Beak Eagle King\u2019s.That one roar cause the hundreds of thousands of beasts to tremble in fear. At this moment, the peak tier deadly beasts stiffened as admiration and fear appeared in their eyes. The humans felt their heart\u2019s jump.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPeh! Peh! Peh\u2026What\u2019s going on?Zhao Feng felt that his blood was trembling and that the thumping sound came from his left eye again.\u201cWhat is this aura that surpasses peak tier deadly beasts?\u201d Ye Linyun, Third Guard and General Heng\u2019s voice were all trembling slightly.A terrifying aura crushed towards the city and it made the hundreds of thousands of beasts bow down as if they were seeing their king\u2026Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

Far away in the midst of the beast horde, a path was formed.\u201cWhat is the thing that puts fear into peak tier deadly beasts.. ?\u201d The cultivators on top of the city wall focused onto the path.Because Zhao Feng had the best eyesight, he saw a pure black dog-type deadly beast walk towards them. The black dog was the size of a wolf at around 1.5metres long and it was small compared to the other beasts.Dog?Zhao Feng wanted to laugh, but he couldn\u2019t. Every step the dog took would radiate a frightening aura and when Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes looked into the eyes of the pitch black dog, he felt like he was on fire.\u201cCould it be\u2026 a Lord Tier deadly beast!?\u201d General Heng took in a cold breath as fear flashed through his eyes.One had to know that General Heng was already at the peak ninth rank and he was one of the strongest cultivators here.Lord Tier Deadly Beast!The faces of the cultivators turned white, they all knew the rumours about Lord Tier deadly beasts. Deadly beasts were split into low and high tier and they were respectively comparable to Martial Artists and Martial Masters, but peak tier deadly beasts weren\u2019t the highest ranked.Above peak tier deadly beasts, there were some terrifying existences \u2013 Lord tier deadly beasts!\u201cThe rumours say that a Lord tier deadly beast can destroy an entire country.\u201dOn top of the Guanjun Province City wall, a few of the cultivators were scared out of their wits.Under the falling sun.Hundreds of thousands of deadly and wild beasts bowed down, facing the Lord tier black dog as the latter slowly walked towards the city. Although the Lord tier deadly beast didn\u2019t attack, it coldly glanced at the people and cultivators such as General Heng, Ye Linyun of the ninth rank would tremble.Under that one scan, the Lord tier deadly beast had confirmed who were the strongest people amongst the cultivators.\u201cStop him!\u201d\u201cPass the information to Our Lord!\u201dA few silver figures appeared on top of a nearby tower.Shua! Shua!\u201cNumber One, number two, number four\u2026 \u201d Third Guard exclaimed.At this moment, the first four of the Guanjun Corps had arrived with First Guard reaching half-step Holy martial path!Ye Linyun took in a cold breath.First Guard was only half a step away from the Holy martial path.Go!The three silver figures jumped down and reached the Lord tier deadly beast in an instant.First Guard, Second Guard, Third Guard and Fourth Guard!The strongest four of the Guanjun Corps formed a semicircle around the Lord tier deadly beast, stopping it.\u201cCultivators of the ninth rank, go help\u2026 \u201d General Heng gave the command solemnly.He knew that the four guards alone probably weren\u2019t able to restrain the Lord tier deadly beast who could destroy an entire country.Shua\u2026 Shua\u2026Soon, another few cultivators of the ninth rank appeared. On top of the city wall, a few of the archers pulled their bows open, Zhao Feng had taken out his Golden Stairs Bow and pulled it open as well.Wu\u2026The pitch black dog coldly scanned the humans on top of the city wall disdainfully as if it had emotions.\u201cSky Heavenly Death Net!\u201dThe four great Guanjun Corps turned into silver blurs, they held short blades and they sent a \u201cnet\u201d of slices that enveloped the Lord tier deadly beast.This Sky Heavenly Death Net had been performed by all four guards and the power of it surpassed normal Holy martial arts.Even though Zhao Feng was far away, his heart jumped. He knew that if he fell into this Sky Heavenly Death Net, he wouldn\u2019t be able to find any flaws even with his left eye.Normal cultivators of the ninth rank would instantly be ripped into shreds if they were trapped in it.For tens of years, no one had ever escaped from this move of the four guards and today, this killing move landed upon the Lord tier deadly beast.Shu\u2026 Shu\u2026 Shu\u2026 Shu\u2026The pitch black dog didn\u2019t have anywhere to run nor dodge as the net surrounded it in every direction.Wu\u2026A layer of black flames appeared on the dog and a terrifying aura swept around its surroundings.Pah!The Lord tier deadly beast randomly swiped with one paw and it instantly caused a black light a few metres long to appear. The simple swipe seemed to contain a deep martial art that had ripped open another dimension.Craaaaak!The Sky Heavenly Death Net shattered.Dang! Dang!The weapons of both Second and Fourth Guard fell to the floor broken as blood leaked from their mouths. The expressions of First and Third Guard turned pale as their body stiffened.Standing on top of the city wall, Zhao Feng\u2019s heart clenched as he saw the swipe of the Lord tier deadly beast. Because in his eyes, the swipe seemed to be a martial art.Deadly beasts know martial arts?Maybe it was just Zhao Feng, but he felt that the move from the Lord tier deadly beast seemed similar to the Mysterious Wind Palm of the girl back in the canyon.Shuuuu\u2026 !The Lord tier deadly beast stomped on the ground and a layer of pitch blames flames was sent out in every direction as it shattered the ground.Dodge it!First Guard exclaimed as he furiously slashed his blade at the black flames.The other guards all did the same.Heavenly Cloud Kill!Slice of Doom!\u2026.General Heng, Ye Linyun and the other ninth ranks arrived and protected the four Guanjun Corps. But the black flames of the Lord tier deadly beast was just too strong, it burned one\u2019s skin before the flame even reached it.\u201cAhhh\u2026 \u201dA cultivator of the ninth rank had his clothes set on fire, so he rolled on the ground trying to flatten it out. But no matter how hard he tried, it didn\u2019t stop the flames and in no time, he became a burnt, black corpse. Not only that, Third Guard and Fourth Guard were also tarnished by the black flame.\u201cForget me, run\u2026 \u201d Fourth Guard screamed as he charged at the Lord tier deadly beast with his body on fire.Craaak!The Lord tier deadly beast swiped its claws and shattered Fourth Guard\u2019s body.\u201cThird Guard!\u201d The other people exclaimed.Third Guard, the overseer of the Sky Guards Battalion also had black flames appear on his arm.Craack\u2026Third Guard clenched his teeth as he chopped off his own arm.\u201cEveryone retreat!\u201d General Heng and First Guard called.Zhao Feng was shocked as he stood on the city wall. Just then, he had used his Golden Stairs Bow and fired a few arrows, but they had all turned into dust before they even came close to the Lord tier deadly beast.Run! Everyone retreat!The ten ninth ranks couldn\u2019t even block a casual swipe of the Lord tier beast.\u201cThe difference is too great\u2026 \u201dBei Moi, Nan Gongfan and the other disciples looked on in fear and they pulled away from the Lord tier deadly beast.Wu\u2026The Lord tier deadly beast howled and a few peak tier deadly beasts appeared behind it.\u201cHe\u2019s calling his troops to attack!\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s heart jumped and he could almost see the destruction of Guanjun Province City.The legend of a Lord tier deadly beast destroying a country was just a legend, was it going to happen in the Cloud Country though?Just as the cultivators were in despair, the sound of wind came from behind.\u201cWhich bastard dares come into my territory?\u201d A deep voice sounded from midair.Souuu\u2026An silver light flashed through the air.\u201cThat\u2019s\u2026 \u201dZhao Feng\u2019s left eye and he managed to catch the image of a middle aged man wearing silver-gold robes flying through the air like a god.In just an instant, the man had moved two hundred metres.\u201cFlying?

The man looked like a god, with a silver glow surrounding him as he clashed with the Lord tier deadly beast in the blink of an eye.The energy remains instantly killed the nearby peak tier deadly beasts, shocking everyone.Wu~~~~Blood gashes appeared on the pitch black dog as it looked at Lord Guanjun with wariness.\u201cGood! Lord Guanjun will kill the Lord tier deadly beast!\u201dThe human cultivator\u2019s expressions that were of despair turned to joy and expectations. In their eyes, Lord Guanjun was a god who could defeat anyone in the world.Zhao Feng let out a breath as he stood on top of the city wall. Just then, he had made the preparations to run if all came to worst and his left eye had analysed the best path to take.At this moment, Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye scanned Lord Guanjun and the Lord tier deadly beast. Without a doubt, the power of them had surpassed the nine ranks of the Martial Path and entered the Holy Martial Path.Shua!Lord Guanjun descended from the air and he sent a wave of air towards his surroundings.\u201cLord Guanjun has surpassed the nine ranks of the martial path and using his power, he can use the wind to help him fly momentarily.\u201d Zhao Feng concluded.Flying, that was the dream of limitless people. Although cultivators of the Holy Martial Path couldn\u2019t fly, the power still made those of the ninth rank look up at them in awe.\u201cBastard! This is the world of humans, go back to the Sky Cloud Forest!\u201d Lord Guanjun stood proudly on the ground and ordered.Under the pressure of his Holy Martial Path, the hundreds of thousands of beasts shook in fear. If the Lord tier deadly beast wasn\u2019t there, they would have fled already.Peh! Prh!Zhao Feng felt some sort of pressure and sizzles of heat coming from his left eye and it was released throughout his body. It made the light inside the dimension of his left eye move closer to seven foot nine.This change made Zhao Feng\u2019s heart beat faster, ever since he had merged with this eye, Zhao Feng felt limitless potential time and time again. At this moment, his cultivation was increasing under the pressure outside. Now, Zhao Feng felt that his future potential had exceed the Half Spiritual Body.Right as he was thinking, the battle below had broke out.Wuuu~~~~~~~The Lord tier deadly beast waved its claw and like black lightning streaking across the sky, a blast of power destroyed everything within thirty metres.Just the damage from it made Zhao Feng\u2019s head tingle. If they let the Lord tier deadly beast into Guanjun Province City, the result would be unthinkable.Ten Cross Rippling Execution!Lord Guanjun\u2019s arm turned to a sharp silver color and in an instant, a bright flash sped through the air that ripped the Lord tier deadly beasts\u2019 attack into shreds.Boom!The ground trembled as dust covered the air. The next instant the two figures had disappeared.Peh! Peh! Boom\u2014-Lord Guanjun and the Lord tier deadly beast exchanged blows quickly, and the remaining energy alone immediately killed the nearby birds. The two figures were small compared to the other deadly beasts, but the aura they radiated made the other beasts tremble in fear.The cultivators on the city wall held their breaths as they watched, although they couldn\u2019t even understand what was going on. Only Zhao Feng could see clearly with his left eye.\u201cStrength, speed, damage\u2026 How is it possible for a human to reach such a level?\u201dZhao Feng took a deep breath and because he saw clearer, he understood how strong cultivators of the Holy martial path were.Cultivators of the Holy Martial Path could decide a country\u2019s fate in the thirteen Sky Cloud countries, therefore even the King would be respectful towards one.Lord Guanjun was one of them, he had absolute power in Sky Cloud Country.When one reached the Holy Martial Path, the time for a battle became very short, but the number of moves exchanged increased significantly.In the midst of booms, the Lord tier deadly beast growled in pain and the black flames decreased whereas the silver light on Lord Guanjun became brighter.\u201cLord Guanjun is almost uninjured and although they\u2019re both at the same realm, he has better technique and skill.\u201d Zhao Feng stared at the two figures.Wu\u2026Fear and wariness appeared in the Lord tier deadly beasts\u2019 eyes as it retreated quickly. It\u2019s actions caused the hundreds of thousands of beasts behind to break into chaos.Escape?Lord Guanjun laughed coldly and waved his arm through the air. As he did so, an eight metre long light flew at the Lord tier deadly beast, leaving behind a gash that went to the bone.Sou\u2026 Sou\u2026 Sou\u2026Two figures weaved through the beast horde.\u201cHahaha\u2026 these bastards are retreating, everyone attack!\u201d\u201cThe beasts have fine materials, which we can sell for gold.\u201dThe cultivators of Guanjun Province City cheered as they charged out of the city.\u201cNan Gongfan, Zhao Feng, Zhao Fei and Feng Hanyue\u2026 we\u2019ll follow and watch how Master slays a Lord tier deadly beast.\u201d Qing Yangshan said excitedly.On the other side, Bei Moi had already follow Lord Guanjun out.\u201cTroops, advance!\u201d General Heng gave the order for the troops and cultivators to attack the fleeing beast horde.\u201cOk.\u201d Zhao Feng nodded his head and he went with the other disciples towards their Master.Zhao Feng was very interested in how the cultivators of the Holy martial path fought. His left eye could see the scenery of Lord Guanjun and the Lord tier deadly beast fighting.After chasing for tens of miles.Lord Guanjun and the Lord tier deadly beast stopped near a forest. The Lord tier beast was full of injuries and it was dripping blood as it kneeled on the ground unable to move.Lord Guanjun\u2019s body stiffened and he didn\u2019t move.Hm? What\u2019s the situation?Zhao Feng was slightly curious. At this moment, Bei Moi, who was eight miles away, couldn\u2019t see what was happening clearly. But Zhao Feng, who was tens of miles away, saw the situation: the Lord tier deadly beast wasn\u2019t kneeling down because of Lord Guanjun, because it\u2019s backside was facing the latter.\u201cWho\u2019s there!?\u201dLord Guanjun was extremely solemn as he released a terrifying mental strength.\u201cZhe.. Zhe\u2026 There\u2019s a Yuefan cultivator in Guanjun Province City\u2026 \u201cA hooded figure sat on top of a black bird. Under the hood, a pair of ice cold eyes stared down at Lord Guanjun as it laughed.It\u2019s him!Zhao Feng\u2019s heart shook as he saw this scene tens of miles away. He had seen this person on that day during the bandit mission and Zhao Feng had a feeling that this beast horde had connections with him.\u201cWhy are you controlling the beast hordes to attack the human city and villages? Aren\u2019t you afraid of the Thirteen County pact?\u201d Lord Guanjun shouted as light twinkled in his eyes.Pah!The black bird in the sky flapped its wings and a black wind twirled towards him. Lord Guanjun\u2019s expression immediately changed as he retreated tens yards. Instantly, the place where he originally stood had dissolved and the Lord tier black dog howled sadly as it died.Si~~Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but take in a cold breath as he saw this scene.The black bird under the hooded figure was at least two times stronger than the black dog. Obviously, he could only see the situation and not what they were saying.As they exchanged words, Lord Guanjun\u2019s expression turned dimmer and dimmer.\u201cZhe zhe zhe\u2026 Today\u2019s playing ends here\u2026 \u201dAt last, the hooded figure with the ice cold blue eyes scanned Bei Moi who had almost caught up and disappeared into the sky.When Bei Moi had arrived, the mysterious hooded figure as well as the black bird had turned into a black dot that merged into the sky.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cMaster, what just happened? Who was he?\u201d Bei Moi asked curiously as he looked at where the hooded figure vanished.Lord Guanjun was silent for a while before he let out a breath: \u201cDanger appears for the thirteen countries of the Sky Cloud Forest\u2026 But this is also a chance for you\u2026.\u201dAs he said that, he looked expectantly at the disciples behind him.A chance?Zhao Feng, Qing Yangshan, Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei had all arrived.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

But he couldn\u2019t hear what they were saying.\u201cMaster, what do you mean?\u201d Feng Hanyue asked, unable to conceal his curiosity.The biggest chance he had to change his destiny was to become Lord Guanjun\u2019s disciple. Through his asking, Yang Qingshan and the others were all expectant.\u201cThis chance is also your Master\u2019s wish\u2026 \u201d Lord Guanjun sighed softly as his eyes looked into the distance with longing, hate, expectancy and other complex emotions.Being someone who had absolute power in Guanjun Province City, what could give him so many emotions?Zhao Feng had also seen similar emotions that day in the Spiritual Martial Hall. But at that time, Lord Guanjun\u2019s emotions passed by in a flash with only Zhao Feng able to catch it.He had asked that day why did Lord Guanjun search for so many geniuses?Lord Guanjun\u2019s reply was to fulfill a wish.Wish?What could his wish be? A wish that he couldn\u2019t even achieve and could only rely on the younger generation?Teng! Sou! Sou!Right at this time, the nearby strong cultivators including Ye Linyun and General Heng headed over, but Lord Guanjun lifted his hand and signalled them to leave.Although Ye Linyun, General Heng and the others were slightly curious, they left without hesitation.The scene made the six youths realise that Lord Guanjun had something important to say.\u201cDid any of you see the mysterious hooded figure?\u201d Lord Guanjun seemed to change the topic.\u201cYes, disciple here saw him last time in the Sky Cloud Forest\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng immediately answered.The only ones who had actually seen the hooded figure were Zhao Feng and Bei Moi and Zhao Feng had seen him twice.\u201cOh?\u2019Lord Guanjun looked at Zhao Feng, slightly stunned: \u201cHow strong do you think he was?\u201d\u201cVery strong!\u201dZhao Feng thought about how the figure had made his moves the two times and his heart couldn\u2019t help but turn cold.Lord Guanjun smiled: \u201cDo you think that he is stronger than me?\u201dThis\u2026Zhao Feng wouldn\u2019t think that his Master would ask this sort of question. Under the gaze of someone who had reached the Holy Martial Path, Zhao Feng could only answer: \u201cPersonally, disciple here thinks that the opponent is at least on par with Master, if not stronger\u2026 \u201dSince he had the mysterious left eye, Zhao Feng was very accurate on how strong someone was. His answer still contained a slight suspicion tone to it.\u201cZhao Feng! What are you saying? How dare you look down upon Master and praise the enemy?\u201d Nan Gongfan immediately exclaimed.The eyebrows of Bei Moi, Yang Qingshan and Feng Hanyue also scrunched up, it was obvious that they didn\u2019t believe him.In the Cloud Country, Lord Guanjun was a legendary figure with supreme power and status. Being disciples of such a person how could they be not confident?Only Zhao Yufei believed Zhao Feng, this came from something that she couldn\u2019t understand.Zhao Feng\u2019s reply surprised Lord Guanjun and the latter couldn\u2019t help but look at him a few more times. This was the first time that he had really inspected this disciple of his.Nan Gongfan and the others were all shocked, it seemed that Master didn\u2019t seem unhappy. In fact, he seemed to look at Zhao Feng in a new way.\u201cSay the truth, what do you think?\u201d Lord Guanjun stared at him.Zhao Feng couldn\u2019t help but remember the stand off between Master and the hooded figure.After a while, he took a deep breath and said confidently: \u201cThe strength of the mysterious figure should be stronger than Master\u2019s.\u201dWhat!?Nan Gongfan, Yang Qingshan and co\u2019s expression changed dramatically. Zhao Feng had guts!\u201cOf course, this is just my feeling.\u201d Feeling the enmity from the other disciples Zhao Feng added another sentence quickly.\u201cIndeed, that fellow\u2019s strength is above mine.\u201d Lord Guanjun\u2019s voice sounded slowly as he looked appraisingly at Zhao Feng.\u201cWhat!? Impossible! How could anyone be stronger than Master!?\u201d Nan Gongfan couldn\u2019t accept it.When they had become his disciples, the Master in their eyes had stood at the peak of the world.\u201cFurthermore, that person can control Lord tier deadly beasts and lead limitless high tier deadly beasts into attacking Guanjun Province City. Under that situation, even I can do nothing to stop the destruction of Guanjun Province City\u2026 \u201d Lord Guanjun said solemnly.Control Lord tier deadly beasts?The disciples couldn\u2019t even imagine this.\u201cThere was a mastermind planning this beast horde\u2026 \u201c Zhao Feng remembered the ice cold blue eyes again.\u201cMaster! How could there be such a terrifying figure? And why did he stop attacking Guanjun Province City?\u201d Yang Qingshan couldn\u2019t accept this as well.The gazes of the six youths focused on Lord Guanjun\u2019s face.\u201cHehe, the world you know is only the tip of an iceberg, the Holy Martial Path\u2026 Is just the beginning. Even someone as strong as that hooded figure doesn\u2019t dare to go against the Thirteen Countries Pact!\u201d Lord Guanjun smiled.Holy Martial Path was just a start?The six prodigies were all stunned. Today, Lord Guanjun had shocked them too much and they could only understand half of this.At this moment, Zhao Feng felt his blood boiling and he suddenly remembered the three youths that day in the canyon. All three of them were extremely young and any one of them could kill an eighth rank Azure Eyed Hyena in one hit. The other two had also looked at the Hyena with disdain and they left it to the girl who had no battle experience.Even Bei Moi was inferior compared to these three and since then, Zhao Feng had understood how large the world was\u2026 There was still too much unknown things out there he couldn\u2019t even touch\u2026\u201cIn your eyes, the Holy Martial Path may be a legend and the nobles who control the Thirteen Countries of the Sky Cloud have extreme power, but this isn\u2019t the truth!\u201d Lord Guanjun said mockingly, but the words he said was exactly what many people thought.That\u2019s exactly what Zhao Feng had thought back at Green Leaf Village and Sun Feather City.\u201cThe true controllers of the Sky Cloud Thirteen Counties aren\u2019t the King, Lords, nobles or family clans! They are the thirteen clans above the mortal world!\u201dSpeaking up to here, Lord Guanjun\u2019s eyes became sharp as if it could rip open a hole in space.Thirteen clans?The six youths looked at each other.Clans!Thirteen Clans that stood above the mortal world!Why hadn\u2019t they heard of them before?When Zhao Feng was still in Green Leaf Village, Sun Feather City was already extremely powerful in his eyes. But as his cultivation rose, his eyes started to wonder towards the Province City and the Thirteen Countries and he found out about the two strong countries next to the Sky Cloud Thirteen Countries.Any one of the two countries could destroy the Thirteen Countries and therefore, the latter had to join together in order to survive.But this wasn\u2019t the truth!\u201cMaster, how strong are the thirteen clans to be able to control the thirteen countries?\u201d Nan Gongfan said in disbelief.\u201cThese clans control the path of cultivation. Every clan only have one thousand or so people, but they control the destiny of a country. If you want to ask how strong they are, your Master, I, was only an outer disciple of Broken Moon Clan.\u201d Lord Guanjun sighed.Outer disciple?Bei Moi and the others froze. Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan shook their heads in disbelief.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cSomeone as strong as Lord Guanjun was only an outer disciple, just like how I was in the Zhao sect\u2026 \u201dWaves appeared in Zhao Feng\u2019s heart. They didn\u2019t need to know how strong the clan was, just the fact that Lord Guanjun was only an outer disciple alone told them.After knowing the truth, the six geniuses felt as if their souls were lost. Their achievements were top tier in Guanjun Province City, but compared with the clan\u2019s, theirs were just like an ant.The two weren\u2019t even on the same level, like how a human wouldn\u2019t bother with an ant.\u201cThe clan that controls the Cloud Country is known as the Broken Moon sect and the peak existences have even surpassed the Holy Martial Path\u2026 \u201d Speaking up to here, expressions of admiration and longing appeared in Lord Guanjun\u2019s eyes.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

So I left the clan and took up the duty of taking care of the mortal things. Therefore, I still have some connections with the clan.\u201dLord Guanjun stopped for a moment, then he threw out another piece of news: \u201cAccording to what I know, the five year disciple test is starting in two months time.\u201dDisciple test!The eyes of the six youths lit up. Bei Moi and the others couldn\u2019t hide the excitement on their faces. The disciple test that took place once every five years was in two months time.\u201cEven the nearby countries can enter the Broken Mood Clan disciple test. At that time, the geniuses from around the country will gather, including those family clans hiding out of sight from mortals who have power even exceeding the Guanjun Palace. When all these prodigies meet up, the competition will be very fierce. Your Master has done his best and he can send a few into the disciple test.\u201d Lord Guanjun summarised the situation.\u201cThe elite of the elite around the country will fight to enter the Broken Moon Clan\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng and the others felt their blood boiling.A battle intent even surged from Bei Moi.In the Guanjun Province City, their talent and strength were top tier, but if they entered the Broken Moon Clan, they could fight the other peak geniuses to see who was stronger.\u201cI have three recommendations for the disciple test in two months time, so you\u2019ve all got to grip this chance.\u201d Lord Guanjun said solemnly as he looked at the six youths in front of him.Three spots?The hearts of all the youths jumped. Even though they were under the same Master, they would still compete against each other.Obviously, Lord Guanjun had more disciples. But there was an age limit for the disciple test, this was why Lord Guanjun didn\u2019t invite Ye Linyun and the others over.Ye Linyun and the rest were older than thirty and the rule of the Broken Moon Clan was that if one wasn\u2019t able to reach the Holy Martial Path by the age of thirty, they wouldn\u2019t be able to become an inner disciples. This also meant that only the six youths in front of him had to compete for the three recommendation spots.\u201cThe beast horde is over. All of you go back to the Guanjun Palace and celebrate!\u201d Lord Guanjun said then disappeared with a flash.Sou! Sou!A streak of silver shot through the sky and it was lost from sight.\u201cMaster tells all of you to go to the Spiritual Martial Hall to get your rewards.\u201d Ye Linyun\u2019s figure appeared in front of the six and the youths nodded their heads in response.On the way back, Feng Hanyue seemed to have something on his mind as he looked back and forth between Bei Moi, Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan.Lord Guanjun could only recommend three people and of the six youths, Bei Moi, Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan had the highest cultivation with all of them being at the eighth rank or higher.Compared to the other three, Feng Hanyue, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei had less of a chance.\u201cI should be able to get one spot out of the three if I try my best.\u201d Zhao Feng thought in his heart.After the beast horde, his strength had risen and the faint green light was coming close to seven foot nine.He had no confidence in beating Bei Moi as the latter could slay ninth ranks, but Zhao Feng was sixty to seventy percent confident that he could beat Yang Qingshan and Nan Gongfan.Furthermore, there was still two more months till the disciple test and Zhao Feng had this time to improve.The six all used their speed skills and arrived back at the Guanjun Palace.Spiritual Martial Hall.\u201cMaster is waiting inside.\u201d Ye Linyun had arrived at the gate already.His cultivation was at the peak ninth rank, so he was the fastest. Bei Moi was second and he had already walked into the hall. After him were Yang Qingshan, Nan Gongfan and Zhao Feng, the other two were slightly surprised by Zhao Feng\u2019s speed.Soon, the sx youths arrived at the Spiritual Martial Hall.Lord Guanjun sat on his futon as he scanned the six disciples.On his left and right were Ye Linyun and First Guard. The youths were all familiar with Ye Linyun, but First Guard was a mysterious person who had reached half step Holy rank.Because Third Guard had been injured during the fight with the Lord tier deadly beast, First Guard took his place.\u201cHow goes the battle points?\u201d Lord Guanjun asked in a deep voice.\u201cMaster, the Guanjun Corps\u2019 calculations have been finalised and they have given the results.\u201d First Guard bowed as he took out a small book.Lord Guanjun didn\u2019t take the book, instead he said: \u201cRead it out.\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dFirst Guard opened the book and spoke what was written on it: \u201cFirst, Zhao Feng \u2013 465 battle points, Second, Bei Moi \u2013 403 battle points\u2026 \u201d\u201cWait!\u201dLord Guanjun\u2019s expression changed as he stared at First Guard: \u201cBei Moi isn\u2019t first?\u201dIn reality, even the other geniuses felt this was unbelievable. How could Bei Moi not be first place? Even Lord Guanjun had his suspicions. At this moment in time, the Martial Spiritual Hall had turned silent.Bei Moi had his fists clenched together and mumbled with an ugly expression: \u201cImpossible! I don\u2019t believe it!\u201d\u201cMaster, Zhao Feng slew the Golden Beak Eagle King and that was where he got most of his points from.\u201d Ye Linyun warned in a low tone.\u201cHow many points for killing the Golden Beak Eagle King?\u201d Lord Guanjun asked.First Guanjun immediately replied: \u201cIt varies from a range of 20 \u2013 60 battle points for killing a high tier deadly beast. But because the Golden Beak Eagle King\u2019s strength was at the peak ninth rank and was extremely hard to kill, 100 battle points were awarded.\u201d100 Battle points!Bei Moi and the others were stunned.\u201cEven if he did kill the Golden Beak Eagle King, his battle points are a bit too much. Tell us the battle points of the others.\u201d Lord Guanjun said calmly.\u201cYang Qingshan \u2013 195 battle points, Nan Gongfan 181 battle points\u2026 \u201d First Guard then called out the battle points of the others.It was obvious that no one else apart from Zhao Feng and Bei Moi reached 200 points.According to logic, Zhao Feng\u2019s battle points should be around 100 or so, even if he did manage to kill the Golden Beak Eagle King and get 100 battle points, it mean that he had received 365 extra battle points and exceeded Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan by far.\u201cImpossible!\u201d Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan shook their heads furiously.Bei Moi laughed coldly, but he didn\u2019t speak. It was obvious that he believed his Master would give the right judgement.\u201cCould there be any problems?\u201d Lord Guanjun asked with his eyebrows raised.Under normal situations, he never questioned the Guanjun Corps, but this time, it was just too unexpected.\u201cMaster, I am sure this is correct and even if there was a problem, it would be extremely small.\u201dFirst Guard said without a doubt then proceeded to go over the detailed calculations.\u201cZhao Feng slew seventy to eighty flying beasts with just his arrows alone and on average, they were worth 2.5 battle points each. From just this alone, he already has 200 and counting the Golden Beak Eagle King, it would be 300\u2026 \u201d First Guard read out.There were records of where the points came from.\u201cOh? Archery?\u201dLord Guanjun was slightly surprised as he looked once again at Zhao Feng.\u201cOn this fact, General Heng, me and the nearby archers can vouch for this.\u201d Ye Linyun added.\u201cHmm\u2026 there shouldn\u2019t be any problems here.\u201d Lord Guanjun wasn\u2019t suspicious at all.Next, it was the other points. After he shot down the flying beasts, he used the remaining time to get another 160 or so points.One had to know that Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan had only earned 180 or so in double his time and the two had higher cultivations than Zhao Feng.\u201cI don\u2019t believe it!\u201d Nan Gongfan shook his head, showing his suspicions.\u201cZhao Feng\u2019s battle conscience is extremely good and every attack he made would take down a beast. His efficiency and speed is double those of the same rank. In terms of this, even the elite of the Guanjun Corps can\u2019t catch up with him\u2026 Maybe he\u2019s a natural killer!?\u201d First Guard glanced complexly at Zhao Feng.Ye Linyun had a bright smile on: \u201cLast time, Zhao Feng had gotten first place in the kill mission as well and at that time, he was only at the sixth rank\u2026 \u201dNow, Zhao Feng\u2019s source of battle points had been explained.Lord Guanjun now had no doubt as he looked at Zhao Feng with praise: \u201cI never thought that I would have a prodigy who\u2019s good at both archery and close combat.\u201dHe knew how his Guanjun Corps were, they would almost never make a mistake.\u201c\u2026 What kind of monster is this guy?\u201d Bei Moi clenched his fists, showing his unwillingness.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euBeing the only core disciple of Lord Guanjun, how could he lose to an outer disciple?Nan Gongfan, Yang Qingshan and Feng Hanyue all looked towards Zhao Feng with shock. Only Zhao Yufei had a smile on her face and she wasn\u2019t surprised by this.After they received their battle points the six geniuses left leaving behind Lord Guanjun, First Guard and Ye Linyun in the Spiritual Martial Hall.\u201cWhat else do you need?\u201d Lord Guanjun asked.First Guard took a deep breath: \u201cMaster, Zhao Feng\u2019s real battles points were actually 565 and not 465!

Being a quasi-Holy martial artist, his words had great importance. First Guard knew that even he himself wouldn\u2019t be able to reach such a level if he was the same rank as Zhao Feng.\u201cMaster! Disciple here said that you wouldn\u2019t regret taking in Zhao Feng as your disciple.\u201d Ye Linyun said smiling. He was always expectant of Zhao Feng and the latter didn\u2019t let him down.Lord Guanjun soon remembered the hesitation he had that day on whether to take Zhao Feng in as a disciple or not. After all, at that time, Zhao Feng\u2019s talent was only a Half Spiritual Body. It was due to the fact that Ye Linyun had recommended him that he had taken him in.It looked like this decision wasn\u2019t wrong.\u201cZhao Feng isn\u2019t bad and his battle proficiency is almost perfect.\u201dLord Guanjun\u2019s words took a twist with a slight sigh to it: \u201cUnfortunately, he\u2019s just a Half Spiritual Body which restricts his future achievements and he won\u2019t be able to complete my wish\u2026 \u201dIt was obvious that Zhao Feng\u2019s performance was indeed great, but Lord Guanjun didn\u2019t think that he would have great achievements in the future.As for Lord Guanjun\u2019s conclusion First Guard didn\u2019t say anything as if he approved. Ye Linyun wanted to retort but there was nothing to say.Indeed.Zhao Feng\u2019s performance was great, but no one had ever thought of him exceeding Bei Moi.\u2026\u2026.After leaving the Spiritual Martial Hall, Zhao Feng immediately headed towards the Treasury Hall.The other disciples, Nan Gongfan, Yang Qingshan, and Feng Hanyue, were all envious and jealous.Bei Moi\u2019s expression was the worst. Ever since he was young, he was a super prodigy in other people\u2019s eyes and no one his age had beat him in anything.When he was back in the village, it was like this then and when he had moved to the city, it was like this as well. But ever since he had met Zhao Feng, this record had been broken again and again.\u201cZhao Feng, you\u2019re not simple. If you have guts, let\u2019s go to the Clan and settle it there.\u201d A rare red light appeared in Bei Moi\u2019s expressionless eyes.Was\u2026 Bei Moi challenging someone?Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan were slightly stunned. They had never seen Bei Moi challenge someone because everyone else his age had been left behind and couldn\u2019t threaten him.\u201cSure.\u201d Zhao Feng immediately answered with a solemn expression.In reality, he felt immense pressure facing a super prodigy such as Bei Moi. But this was also a good thing, he could use it to ignite his potential. With his battle points, he could get many martial arts, resources, pills, and weapons.\u201cWhat should I get with the battle points?\u201d Zhao Feng went into deep thought.Martial arts?Zhao Feng felt that he didn\u2019t need any as he already had Metal Wall Technique and Returning Breath Technique, one was a Holy martial art while the other was close to a Holy martial art. The others such as Lightly Floating Ferry and Smoking Transparent Step could reach the tier of Holy martial arts by combining them with Flowing Wind Stance.It seemed like his lowest tier skill was Star Finger.\u201cStar Finger is a peak martial art and it can be classified as a Half-Holy martial art. Using it with Tornado Stance, it can surpass normal half-Holy martial arts. If I train it to the seventh level, it can even beat Holy martial arts as it\u2019s extremely hard to train Holy martial arts to a high level.\u201d Zhao Feng analysed.He finally decided not to get another offensive skill. With his battle points, he could only get half-Holy martial arts and not Holy martial arts. Just like this, Zhao Feng decided to not get any martial arts.His focus was on pills and resources.Of his skills, Silver Wall Technique was the highest level and it was the foundation of the nine ranks of the Martial Path. Zhao Feng remembered what Lord Guanjun and Ye Linyun had discussed.\u201cTherefore, I should go all in on my body strengthening technique.\u201d A light flashed in Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes as he decided.He then immediately went into the Thousand Medicine Pavilion inside the Treasury Hall. His aim was the resources that could help his body strengthening technique.\u201cChilling Snow Body Pill, using a large amount of coldness to strengthen the body and it is one of the best pills for the nine ranks of the Martial Path. It must be used with care for those under the eighth rank.\u201d\u201cBurning Sun Bone Pill, using an extremely hot flame to burn the bones and it is one of the best body strengthening pills. It has a better effect when used with Chilling Snow Body Pill\u2026 \u201d\u201cGolden Body Strengthening Powder, the king of body strengthening resources, is a very chaotic and dominant powder, it has a 50% chance rate of crippling a cultivator at the eighth rank!\u201dSoon, Zhao Feng found the three best peak tier pills.The Chilling Snow Body Pill cost him 120 battle points. The Burning Sun Bone Pill cost him 119 battle points. The Golden Body Strengthening Powder cost him 167 battle points.Just the three alone cost him over 400 battle points.One had to know that a peak ranked martial art only cost 10 points and a half-Holy martial art cost 50.As for the leftover battle points, Zhao Feng bought some lower class body strengthening resources. Even then, these resources were much better than the body strengthening powder he had bought at the Medicine Pavilion.On the same day.Zhao Feng had spent all his battle points. The couple of hundred battle points had been exchanged for over half of the precious stock for body strengthening resources.In the Guanjun Palace, not everyone could get battle points and even if they could, there was a limit to how much could be exchanged. But being the disciple of Lord Guanjun, he could get more items for the same amount of battle points.For example, if someone else wanted a Chilling Snow Body Pill, they needed 170 battle points but he only needed 120. And even then if they had enough, they might not have the status to exchange for it.After leaving the Treasury Hall, Zhao Feng returned to his place and started to cultivate.For the next month, he focused solely on Silver Wall Technique.For the first seven days, he used the lower class body strengthening resources that were compatible with cultivators of the seventh rank or higher. The pills and medicine he got were different according to their nature.For example: Chilling Snow Body Pill was of cold nature, whereas Burning Sun Bone Pill was of fire nature and Golden Body Strengthening Powder was of metal nature.Therefore, he made sure that the pills of the same element weren\u2019t used right after one another as his body would start to have resistance against it.Seven days later.Zhao Feng\u2019s Silver Wall Technique reached the seventh level, but this had also used up all of his lower class resources.\u201cI can suppress most cultivators of the seventh rank with just my body alone.\u201dZhao Feng could feel the explosive strength hiding inside his arms. Every punch could instantly kill anyone under the seventh rank.Now Zhao Feng only had a Chilling Snow Body Pill, a Burning Sun Bone Pills and Golden Strengthening Powder left. According to what he had planned, he first consumed the Chilling Snow Body Pill.After eating it, a terribly cold aura spread out amongst his body. Three days and three nights later, his body had been frozen, the danger was unimaginable.\u201cNo wonder it said that eighth rank cultivators need to be cautious when using it.\u201dOnly after three days and three nights did Zhao Feng resolve the situation. Even before all of the energy had been absorbed, Zhao Feng immediately then ate the Burning Sun Bone Pill.The two were ice and fire and even though it was extremely painful, the effects were better. Zhao Feng circulated his Silver Wall Technique and Returning Breath Technique to absorb the chaotic energy.Peh! Peh!His left eye released sizzles of heat that spread out throughout his body. After the merging of the mysterious left eye, his potential and efficiency of energy absorbing had increased.Eight days later.The ice and fire pills were absorbed.Hu!Zhao Feng let out a breath as he stood up. As he did so, he could feel his bones and skin become tougher. The body was first strengthened from the outside, then to the inside where his liver was. The stronger his liver was, the more he could use his Inner Strength.\u201cThe body is the foundation, even though I didn\u2019t focus on Returning Breath Technique, I could still feel my cultivation increase.\u201d Zhao Feng thought.At this moment, his cultivation had reached the peak seventh rank and he was only half a step away from the eighth.At the same time, his Silver Wall Technique had also reached the peak seventh level.After Silver Wall Technique reached the seventh level, his organs had been strengthened and therefore, more of his potential had been released.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.eu\u201cHe!\u201dZhao Feng exclaimed as he merged his Returning Breath Inner Strength into his Silver Wall Technique.Weng~~A faint silver layer of light suddenly appeared, which gave off a deep aura.The Silver Air Barrier had been formed!Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",
    "Chapter 99": "Chapter 99Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter>A+A-\ud83d\udcdaMark Read\u2699\ufe0fPlayChapter 99 \u2013 BanquetSilver Air Barrier was a move which created a defensive barrier around the body and it was extremely effective against a large amount of people.Obviously, the Silver Air Barrier had its weakness as well and that was the energy expended!Most cultivators of the seventh rank would only use the Silver Air Barrier at a critical moment because it could last only tens of breaths. But being at the peak seventh rank and having trained the Returning Breath Technique, Zhao Feng could sustain it for twice that amount of time.\u201cThe Silver Wall Technique has reached the peak seventh level, I can challenge the eighth ranks with just my muscles alone. If I use the Silver Air Barrier, even ninth ranks won\u2019t be able to injure me for a short amount of time.\u201d Zhao Feng analysed his strength.Under the ninth rank, there was generally no one his match unless they were on the same level with Bei Moi, who had trained a few Holy martial arts to a high level.For the next few days, Zhao Feng circulated his Silver Wall Technique to fully absorb the last remaining bits of medicine in his body.Four to five days later.The remaining energy had been absorbed by the Silver Wall Technique and it was only half a step away from the eighth level.\u201cIf I use the Golden Body Strengthening Powder now, Silver Wall Technique can reach the eighth level as long as I bear the chaotic energy.\u201d Light flashed in Zhao Feng\u2019s eyes.After thinking for a long time, he decided to not do this.Firstly, the Golden Body Strengthening Technique was too chaotic, half of the cultivators of the eighth rank who used this were crippled. The energy contained inside was half a tier higher than the Chilling Snow Body Pill and the Burning Sun Bone Pill.Secondly, the continuation of using resources meant that his body would start to resist the use of pills and not achieve the best effect. Therefore, Zhao Feng decided to slowly cultivate himself instead of using the Golden Body Strengthening Powder.For the next few days, he focused on cultivating Silver Wall Technique and at the same time, he tried to gain understanding from the Four Wind Stances and the Mysterious Wind Palm in the dimension of his left eye.After the beast horde, Zhao Feng\u2019s potential had once again been increased and both his Four Wind Stances and the Mysterious Wind Palm had major improvements.As time passed, Zhao Feng fully learnt the Tornado Stance.The Tornado Stance could increase the power and area of an attack. Zhao Feng merged the Tornado Stance with Star Finger making the latter comparable to a Holy martial art.If he was able to merge the Tornado Stance with the Mysterious Wind Palm, maybe the power of it could even exceed normal Holy martial arts.Next, Zhao Feng began to look into the third move of the Four Wind Stance, the Partial Wind Stance.The Partial Wind Stance was an offensive skill, which wasn\u2019t hard nor easy to learn.On this day.Zhao Feng\u2019s understanding of the Partial Wind Stance finally reached a bottleneck at 30-40%.Closing his eyes, Zhao Feng went through his Holy martial arts.Mysterious Wind Palm had been generally fully leant. Of the 4 Wind Stances, the first 3 had been learnt. Compared to those, his Star Finger had progressed the best, reaching the sixth level, just one level away from the highest one.\u201cThere\u2019s still one month till the Clan entrance test, but my Silver Wall Technique still hasn\u2019t reached the eighth level yet.\u201d Zhao Feng murmured to himself.Right now, he was mainly focusing on his body instead of cultivation. As long as his foundation was strong, his cultivation would increase anyways so he didn\u2019t focus on improving his cultivation or else, he would\u2019ve already reached the eighth rank. But the problem was, the later stages of body strengthening techniques were much harder and they took a much longer time to improve.Zhao Feng let out a breath and walked out of his place to breathe in the fresh air and relax.It wasn\u2019t efficient to keep on cultivation, sometimes relaxation helped bottlenecks.\u201cYoung Master Zhao, a few days ago, Young Master Bei Moi sent an invitation to you for you to join the banquet.\u201d A servant said respectfully.Bei Moi? Banquet?Zhao Feng felt somewhat weird, why was there a banquet?The servant responded to his thoughts: \u201cA few days ago, Young Master Bei Moi reached the ninth rank without even reaching 16 years old, shocking the Guanjun Palace. Lord Guanjun has decided to hold a banquet for him.\u201dNinth rank!Zhao Feng\u2019s heart jumped. It wasn\u2019t hard to imagine that Bei Moi had also made major improvements after the beast horde, which helped him reach the ninth rank.In the past 20 years, there was no news of anyone reaching the ninth rank before sixteen years old within the Cloud Country. One had to know that many cultivators wouldn\u2019t even be able to reach the seventh rank in their entire lives and every rank after the seventh rank was harder to reach.\u201cNot even 16 years old and at the ninth rank\u2026 it\u2019s unfortunate to be in the same generation as Bei Moi\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng sighed.Usually, geniuses such as Nan Gongfan and Feng Hanyue would be top tier in their generation, but after meeting Bei Moi, their spotlight was all taken by him.Zhao Feng asked: \u201cWhen\u2019s the banquet?\u201d\u201cTomorrow evening.\u201d The servant replied as he bowed.Zhao Feng nodded his head as he felt a large amount of pressure in his heart. From the current situation, the gap between them had remained the same, even though he had increased by leaps and bounds.Returning to his room.Zhao Feng calmed down and continued to cultivate his Silver Wall Technique. Under the pressure of a super prodigy, a \u201cPeh Peh\u201d sound came from within his left eye that released a weird aura into his body. An electric and numbing feeling appeared throughout his body as he trained his SIlver Wall Technique. Zhao Feng\u2019s heart jumped as he immediately fully circulated Silver Wall Technique.One day and night later.A faint black sticky liquid appeared on Zhao Feng\u2019s body.Hu!His body felt extremely nice as he reached a entire new level. At this moment, he released an unseeable aura just from him breathing.\u201cSilver Wall Technique had reached the eighth level under this situation.\u201d Zhao Feng let out a breath with a joyful expression on his face.Usually, his Silver Wall Technique needed around half a month to a few months to break through. But maybe because of the pressure from Bei Moi, his left eye ignited his potential.Zhao Feng was extremely confident that no one was his match under the ninth rank and he was even able to face normal ninth ranks.Creeek!Zhao Feng smiled as he walked out of the room. Outside, a beautiful moon shone in the dark night sky.\u201cI almost forgot! Bei Moi\u2019s banquet is tonight\u2026 \u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s heart thumped.Looking at the time it seemed like the banquet had been going for a while now.Teng!Zhao Feng immediately headed towards the location of the banquet.In the dark night sky, a bright full moon made the stars seem dim. This scene seemed to symbol of Bei Moi taking the light of the other geniuses. The banquet\u2019s location was the Spiritual Martial Hall and only a few people were invited. When Zhao Feng walked inside the Spiritual Martial Hall, he found that the banquet was coming to an end.Inside the hall, Lord Guanjun and all his disciples were present.\u201cBrother Zhao, why did you just arrive?\u201d Nan Gongfan\u2019s eyebrow\u2019s raised.\u201cGreetings, Master! Congratulations, Brother Bei Moi!\u201d Zhao Feng didn\u2019t bother with Nan Gongfan as he went to greet Lord Guanjun and congratulate Bei Moi.Bei Moi\u2019s aura was even more powerful than before, proving that he had reached the ninth rank. Compared to when he was at the eighth rank, he was now two times stronger.Under the analysis of his left eye, Zhao Feng concluded that Bei Moi\u2019s strength was close to a half-step Holy martial artist. This meant that Bei Moi\u2019s strength had surpassed Ye Linyun and Third Guard and almost no one was his match under the Holy martial rank.Lord Guanjun and Bei Moi didn\u2019t really mind that Zhao Feng was late. Lord Guanjun and Bei Moi, the master and disciple, were the focus of the banquet. Lord Guanjun smiled happily as he looked at Bei Moi with care, love and expectation.Compared to him the other disciples such as Nan Gongfan, Zhao Feng and Yang Qingshan were like the leaves of a flower.\u201cThere\u2019s still one month till the entrance examination of the Broken Moon Clan. Disciple here will definitely fulfill Master\u2019s wish.\u201d Bei Moi promised, he could feel the expectation and care from Lord Guanjun.\u201cYou\u2019re Master\u2019s best disciple and I believe that you can walk even further after entering the clan.\u201d Lord Guanjun nodded his head, smiling.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euThe banquet had come to the end, leaving behind Lord Guanjun and his six disciples. Even people such as Ye Linyun had retreated, which made Zhao Feng think that Lord Guanjun was going to say something important to his disciples.\u201cYou all know that there\u2019s still one month till the entrance examination of the Broken Moon Clan and Master here only has 3 recommendations. In ten days time, I will choose 3 people depending their your strength and potential.\u201d Lord Guanjun went straight into the topic.Everyone\u2019s heart shook when they heard this. Even though they all had the same master, they needed to fight another for the 3 spots.6 people, 3 recommendations!In the midst of them, Bei Moi easily took up one spot. This meant that out of Yang Qingshan, Nan Gongfan, Feng Hanyue, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei, only two of them would be chosen.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter",

After what Master had just said, they were now competing against each other.\u201cOnly ten days time\u2026 \u201dFeng Hanyue clenched his fists together and glanced sideways at Yang Qingshan and Nan Gongfan. Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan were both at the late stages of the eighth rank and if there wasn\u2019t any accidents, the other two recommendations would go to them.On the other hand, Feng Hanyue, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei were all at the peak of the seventh rank. Zhao Feng was extremely calm, he had complete confidence that he was able to take one spot but he was worried for Zhao Yufei. Next to him, Zhao Yufei looked sadly at him, which confirmed Zhao Feng\u2019s thoughts of her giving up.Through his left eye, he estimated Zhao Yufei\u2019s strength and she didn\u2019t have much of a chance.\u201cZhao Feng! Do you remember my challenge? We\u2019ll settle it out in the Clan. Of course, that\u2019s if you get in\u2026 \u201d Bei Moi looked playfully towards Zhao Feng.It was obvious that he didn\u2019t think that Zhao Feng was doing well in the current situation.Firstly, Zhao Feng\u2019s talent and cultivation was lower than Yang Qingshan and Nan Gongfan. Secondly, it was another problem if he could pass the test with a Half-Spiritual Body. Therefore, the actual chance of the two settling it out was quite low.\u201cThere will be that day.\u201d Zhao Feng\u2019s voice was confident as he walked away leaving Nan Gongfan and Yang Qingshan behind.\u201cWhere does the confidence come from? What sort of trick does he have to take our spots?\u201d Nan Gongfan mocked.Yang Qingshan, on the other hand had a solemn expression as he looked at Zhao Feng\u2019s back.The six youths immediately started cultivating the second they returned home. For the last ten days, Feng Hanyue, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei were all using time available to try and break through. Yang Qingshan and Nan Gongfan didn\u2019t dare to be overconfident, so they both consolidated and tried to increase their strength.The one most relaxed was Bei Moi. He had no pressure at all, it was almost certain that he would get in the Clan but even then he only got to relax for two days.After all, Lord Guanjun personally taught him which was a treatment that Zhao Feng and co. wouldn\u2019t receive. Therefore, in the last ten days, the six geniuses all had certain breakthroughs under the pressure.On the fifth day.Zhao Feng reached the eighth rank. He didn\u2019t even try that hard to increase his cultivation, since his main focus was still Silver Wall Technique.On the seventh day.Feng Hanyue and Zhao Yufei both reached the eighth rank.The ten days passed in a blink of an eye. On the morning of the tenth day, the six youths returned to the Spiritual Martial Hall.Lord Guanjun stood with his hands behind his back and on either side stood Ye Linyun and the one armed Third Guard.The six youths stood in a row with Bei Moi at the front, waiting for their Master.\u201cNot bad.\u201dLord Guanjun scanned the six youths and nodded his head in satisfaction. All of them had reached the eighth rank with Bei Moi at the ninth.It could be said that any one of the six could dominate an entire small city.\u201cMaster, have you confirmed the three recommendations?\u201d Ye Linyun said expectantly.\u201cYes, I\u2019ve decided to give the three spots to Bei Moi, Yang Qingshan and Nan Gongfan.\u201d Lord Guanjun said deeply.Hearing this, the expressions of Feng Hanyue, Zhao Feng and Zhao Yufei changed while happiness appeared on Yang Qingshan\u2019s and Nan Gongfans.Zhao Feng was pretty surprised, he didn\u2019t think that Master would make this decision so easily. He first thought that they were going to spar with each other then choose the strongest three.\u201cMaster, aren\u2019t you going to give the other three a chance?\u201d Ye Linyun was stunned.Third Guard, who had lost an arm, also raised his eyebrows. It didn\u2019t seem like the way Master usually acted. Lord Guanjun smiled faintly but his expression suddenly changed right as he was about to speak.\u201cWho!?\u201d Lord Guanjun exclaimed as his voice resounded through the hall.At the same time, his sight landed on a garden near the Spiritual Martial Hall.\u201cHehehe\u2026 Uncle Xu, long time no see!\u201dA laughter appeared from the garden.Shua!A youth clothed in black stripes landed on the field like a dragonfly. This handsome youth was around 27-28 years old and had a queer aura. He was extremely confident as he looked smilingly at Lord Guanjun and Bei Moi.As their sights met, Lord Guanjun\u2019s figure trembled as if he was wary of something.\u201cThe clothes on him\u2026 \u201dZhao Feng stared at the clothes of the mysterious youth. It was a black striped shirt that seemed familiar. Soon the images of three youths in the canyon appeared.The clothes of this youth in front of him was the same as the three from that day.\u201cWho dares to trespass the important grounds of the Guanjun Palace?\u201d Ye Linyun exclaimed as his Inner Strength surged.Ceng Ceng!At the same time, the other three Guanjuan Corps present, including Third Guard lept at the mysterious youth.\u201cStop!\u201dLord Guanjun\u2019s urgent voice sounded in Ye Linyun and co.\u2019s ears. Third Guard, who was just about to make his move stopped but the other two Guanjun Corps weren\u2019t able to stop in time as their attacks landed on the mysterious youth.Tok! Tok!A cold flash of light in the sharp of a curved moon swiped across the two Guanjun Corps.Wu~A fountain of blood appeared on the two Guanjun Corps who were almost at the ninth rank. In the blink of an eye, two Guanjun Corps had died.Ye Linyun, Bei Moi and the others didn\u2019t even see how the youth moved. Because Zhao Feng didn\u2019t manage to open his left eye in time, he only saw a blur.\u201cThirteenth Guard! Fourteenth Guard!\u201d The one armed Third Guard stared at the corpses of the other two.The people present all took in a cold breath as they stared at the mysterious youth.\u201cStand down!\u201d Lord Guanjun shouted and signalled for them to back away.Bei Moi and the others all moved out of the field without hesitation leaving behind only Lord Guanjun and the mysterious youth behind. Everyone held their breaths as they looked at the handsome youth.Who was he? Why would Master be wary of him?Suspicions rose in the six youth\u2019s hearts. Only Zhao Feng understood to a certain degree.\u201cNephew Quan Chen, what is the meaning of this?\u201d Lord Guanjun stared angrily at the youth in front of him.\u201cI came here this time to greet Uncle Xu Ran and to test a genius you took under your wing.\u201d Quan Chen said casually.From the beginning till now, he had a carefree attitude.Uncle Xu Ran?Zhao Feng finally knew Lord Guanjun\u2019s real name.\u201cThanks for his care! I\u2019m the outer supervisor of the mortal world. When did your Master have any rights to take care of my business?\u201d Lord Guanjun snickered.Zhao Feng felt that the Master behind Quan Chen and Lord Guanjun didn\u2019t seem to have a good relationship.\u201cHahaha, Master reached the True Spirit Realm half a year ago and became the only elder promoted in ten years. I\u2019m under orders from him to check this place out, is there any problems?\u201d Quan Cheng smiled.True Spirit Realm!Lord Guanjun\u2019s heart jumped: \u201cHow could he have reached the True Spirit Realm so fast!?\u201dAt this point, Lord Guanjun didn\u2019t have anything to say, as if he couldn\u2019t accept this reality.\u201cYou\u2019re called Bei Moi?\u201d Quan Chen turned towards Bei Moi with interest.Shua!Bei Moi only felt a rush of wind and before he could do anything a hand appeared on his shoulder.\u201cRelease me\u2026 \u201d Bei Moi\u2019s face was red as he tried to struggle, but he found that the Inner Strength inside him had been sealed.\u201cStop!\u201dLord Guanjun immediately flew over and a sharp silver glow appeared on his arms.Shoooook!The full power of a Holy martial artist flew at Quan Chen. Quan Chen smiled and he let go of Bei Moi as a cold moon symbol appeared on his hands which clashed with Lord Guanjun\u2019s move.Zzzzzz~The remaining energy swept up everything nearby and destroyed the building in an instant. A large hole appeared where the two exchanged moves.Shua! Shua!The two figures flew into the air and exchanged lightning-fast blows.Peng! Boom! Bam\u2026The cultivators nearby only felt figures teleport through the air and everywhere they went an extremely loud sound would appear.\u201cIs this a fight between Holy martial artists\u2026 ?\u201dThrough Zhao Feng\u2019s left eye, he could see the process of the two fighting and he moved back and forth to make sure he wasn\u2019t hit by the remaining energy.Read Latest Chapters at wuxiaworld.euPah\u2014-At a certain moment, an extremely loud thumping sound appeared as the two figures landed back on the ground.\u201cUncle, your cultivation hasn\u2019t seem to improved in the the couple of years we haven\u2019t met.\u201dQuan Chen landed on the ground with his hands behind his back with a dazzling smile.\u201cYou\u2026 \u201d Lord Guanjun managed to say as a streak of blood leaked out of his mouth.Previous Chapter<All ChaptersNext Chapter"
